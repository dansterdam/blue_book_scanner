Stull ...
(Continued from Page 1)

and news offices in the presence of the
Lorenzens, and finally got her doctor
on the phone. Eventually the Lorenzens
got 'the picture.

Sharon Stull and her mother claim
Sharon came home for lunch on that
date, ate, then walked the 1/2 mile back
to school. While playing there with her
10-year-old sister Robin, Sharon saw a
white, egg-shaped object in the sky
(toward Sandia Corp.). She pointed it
out to the others who lost interest and
went back to their games. Sharon continued to watch, then went in to class.
She watched it about 10 minutes afterward and there is no way to determine
how large or how close the object was.

That evening, when she came home
from school, Sharon complained of pain
in her eyes, and her parents called a
Dr. and she was taken to Bataan Hospital. There, she was treated for sunburn with a sunburn ointment. The
burns were only on her face, from her
bangs to her chin. She had long hair,
was wearing leotards, long-sleeved sweater and skirt; therefore the exposed
parts of body were where she could be
burned; however, there were no burns on her neck
or hands.

When the Ls talked to the Doctor
by phone from the Stulls, he said he
would have expected 8 hours of sun
exposure to burn the child to that extent, but he could not support Mrs.
Stull's claim about the accelerated
growth.

Conversation with Lt. Jolly of the
Albuquerque Police force indicated that
the children who Sharon Stull had said
also observed the object, denied it, including her sister Robin. Within an hour
of their arrival, the Lorenzens deduced
that Sharon Stull may have seen an
object and may have been burned, but
that certain factors, some of which have
been mentioned above, preclude the
events being a major case. Other factors are that Mrs. Stull admitted she
had called Zamora and asked him questions about his experience; she seemed
to be more interested in parlaying her
daughter's experience into a moneymaking scheme—that a TV announcer
had gotten involved with the Stulls,
making a public plea for money for
them in January when they arrived in
Albuquerque from Los Angeles, absolutely penniless and without a place to live
or prospect of employment.

During the conversations with Mrs.
Stull, she consistently called the one

TV announcer a "good friend," and the
Doctor their "family doctor." The truth
of the matter was that the TV announcer had not seen the Stulls since he got
help for them in January, until the burn
case came up. The Doctor said he had
never seen the Stulls until he was
called in to take care of Sharon, as a
result of the "burn" from the UFO.

One thing notable during the visit
with the Stulls was that the story tended
to get more involved and "stickier" as
the Lorenzens expressed their interest
in minute details. Mrs. Stull did all the
talking, except to occasionally say to
Mr. Stull, "Isn't that right, Max?" (an
unhealthy condition to say the least) to
which he would give an affirmative answer. The Ls had a difficult time questioning Robin (never did succeed there)
and Sharon. Mrs. Stull repeatedly insisted that the Air Force had suggested
they not talk too much about the case,
and that their rights were being trod
upon.

After leaving Albuquerque, the Lorenzens re-visited Socorro to bring themselves up to date on details of more
recent sightings there. They then drove
home to Tucson where they learned
some upsetting facts:

Mrs. Stull had called the Lorenzens
home and asked the Lorenzen children
for the name and address of the Doctor
in California who was interested in her
case, because, she said, "your folks forgot to give it to us." Mrs. Stull also
called the TV Station (which had done
a taped interview with Zamora and
was currently doing a UFO news series) and insinuated that the Lorenzens had
promised the Stull family would be
moved to Los Angeles at the station's
expense and Sharon would be treated
free by the Doctor, and Mr. Stull would
be given employment.

The whole thing was preposterous and
the Lorenzens were hard put to understand the kind of people who would attempt to perpetrate such a fraud.

As was stated at the beginning of the
article, Sharon Stull may have been
burned by a UFO but the strange and
unethical behavior of her parents indicates an attempt to capitalize to the
extent of embroidering the facts and
actual attempted coercion. It may be this
behavior which prompted Hynek to write
the case off as sunburn, and the Air
Force to label the case a hoax. The
parents of other children involved may
have cautioned their children not to
admit seeing the object in order to
avoid being involved with the Stull
family.

The Stull Case

One incident which purportedly occurred on 28 April 1964, might have been very important from the standpoint of the nature of the propulsion of the UFO were it not for several factors involved, including personalities.

Newspapers in Santa Fe and Albuquerque carried stories about a 10-year-old girl, Sharon Stull, who had received facial burns after watching an egg-shaped UFO from a school playground in Albuquerque on the above date. Mrs. Lorenzen attempted to call the Max Stull residence the day after the incident but found that the telephone number had been changed and was unlisted.

Because of older investigations APRO let the Lorenzen side and in June Mr. L. sent a wire to the Stulls asking that they make an appointment with her and Mr. Lorenzen on a forthcoming weekend.

Then ensued a series of calls initiated by Mrs. Stull and stating that (1) Sharon was showing adolescent development at an accelerated rate, (2) She was growing in weight and height, and (3) Her tear ducts didn't function properly and she had to be supplied with "artificial tears" saline solution, among other things.

Attempts were made to speak to the family - doctor, to no avail. Messages left asking him to call brought no results. The Lorenzens decided to make a trip to Albuquerque to get the facts on the Stull case as well as to clear up several details of other sightings.

Before they left, the Lorenzens called a Doctor in California to ask about the possible cause of the purported symptoms of Sharon Stull, upon observation by the Lorenzens, showed no indication of accelerated growth of maturation unusual for a 10-year-old girl soon to be 11. She had a few eruptions on her face which prevented the appearance of adolescent pimples, and her eyes looked irritated. Mrs. Stull made call after call to TV

YOUNGSTER APPARENTLY BURNED BY SAUCER

Albuquerque, New Mexico, April 28 - Shortly preceding 12:30 p.m., 10-year old Sharon Stull observed an egg-shaped UFO, described as somewhat smaller than an airplane, in the northeastern sky, while on the grounds of the Local Elementary School.

According to her story, the object hovered for awhile, then moved upward vertically, thence downward, several times, and then, after 5 or 10 minutes, evidently disappeared. Miss Stull's eight year old sister, Robin, also saw the strange craft; but, refused to look at it for any length of time.

While in class after 1 p.m., Sharon noticed a burning sensation about her eyes and face, and was treated by a doctor at Bataan Hospital. Her eyes were described as inflamed, and part of her face and nose were "puffy" and red.

According to the doctor's diagnosis, she was suffering from membrane inflammation of both eyes and first degree sunburns under the eyes and nose. The doctor also stated that her exposure to the sun did not seem sufficient to have caused such an intense irritation.

At press time, we are informed that the girl has undergone some remarkable physical and psychological changes. A complete report will appear in our next issue.

One section I can clearly read near the right side of the document states:

"One official said it would be specific in some areas to have a UFO to go where it goes in that region. A report from a reputable agency other than a newspaper or a signed statement signed here to be in a close area. Backing by mounting, tracking and other scientific techniques."

The rest of the document contains text that is difficult to fully transcribe due to poor image resolution and contrast. Large portions of the text are blurry or faded, making complete OCR challenging.

MAN EMPTIES TWO ROUNDS OF BULLETS AT UFO

Albuquerque, New Mexico, April 28 — Shortly after midnight, Don Adams, 20-year old resident of Edgewood, New Mexico, allegedly shot at a UFO near Moriarty.

He was driving on U.S. Route 66 near Moriarty, when he encountered a light green, luminous, oblong craft, 25 to 30 feet long. As Adams attempted to drive his car beneath the object, his vehicle stalled. This is reminiscent of the peculiar electromagnetic effects often reported when a UFO is in close proximity to an automobile.

Adams left his car, took out his .22 calibre pistol, and fired six shots at the UFO, hearing such bullet bounce out. As he was reloading, the object veered away towards the north. He fired another six bullets at the UFO, but was unable to determine if he hit the craft.

Investigators pronounced him "sober."

TWELVE SHOTS FIRED AT FLYING SAUCER: A news report dated April 28th, just four days after the Socorro incident, tells of another astonishing occurrence in New Mexico. Dan Haas of Edgewood, N.M., saw a glowing green-colored object about 25 feet long, hovering only 100 feet above the ground, as he was driving his car late on the night of the 27th. As he drove under the object, his car stalled. (This is just one more case of the strange electro-magnetic effects of saucers. - Editor.) Thereupon, the young man got out and fired six shots at the UFO, then reloaded and fired again. The first six bullets hit the saucer and were heard to bounce off it. Means was not sure if the next six hit the object, or not. By this time the UFO was drifting silently northwards. Originally, it had been directly over his head. Once the saucer had left the vicinity, his automobile performed normally again.

Edgewood Youth Says He Saw
A Weird and Unidentified Flying Object

A 20-year-old Edgewood youth says he saw a mountain lion-like unidentified flying object which shadowed his car near Moriarty, N.M.

The youth, whose name was withheld, told State Police he was driving about 100 feet off the ground. He said it appeared to be a "round or glowing greenish-white object about 25 feet long."

When the officer he drove his car under the object, he said the youth reported he flew not with the car, but parallel. The youth reported he landed and fired several warning shots without effect. The officer said he did not determine if Adams was lying or not.

Photos Mailed
The state director of Interplanetary Intelligence of Gainesville, Fla., contacted T. Fox, a radio officer aboard the USS Ramsey, at the HUFO office. Hayden said the photos were taken at White Sands Missile Range.

Similar Reports
All the reports are similar in that they describe novel or unusual objects with an apparent size of a car to about 20 feet or more. State police and military officials have confirmed that several such sightings have been made in the area.

SANTA FE (UPI) - New Mexico's perennial addition to flying saucers has taken hold of the state again with more "saucer" reports to police over the weekend.

The latest, which brought out the Air Force and the FBI, was spotted Sunday about 50 miles north of Santa Fe. Martin Vigil said, "there was definitely something there."

Fe told State Police he was within 500 feet of a huge metallic object that looked like an egg-shaped machine. He said flames spurted silently from numerous vents around the object. It was as long as a telephone pole and about 15 feet high, he told police.

Gallegos' report came on the heels of a similar report from Lonnie Zamora, who said he spotted an object near Socorro Friday night. Zamora, in clearing up his report, said the object rose about 20 feet off the ground and slowly flew away.

Similar reports came from a Socorro rancher and from others driving in the area.

State Police Capt. Orlando Gallegos of Santa Fe told State Police he was told of a huge metallic object near Socorro by a motorist, and driving in the area where the object was reported, he said he saw the object flying in the western sky at the same time.

Until the recent sightings, New Mexico had been relatively quiet in UFO reports compared to previous years.

GIRL BURNED BY STRANGE RAYS WHILE WATCHING UFO: In another incident in the New Mexico portion of the incredible 1964 saucer flap, a 10-year-old received painful facial burns while watching a "strange egg-shaped thing" in the sky on the afternoon of April 28th, Sharon Shull, one of five children of Mr. and Mrs. Max Stull, suffered eye, nose and face burns during the five to ten minutes that she watched the UFO from the play yard of her school in Albuquerque. Sharon was not facing the sun while watching the object, which was slightly smaller than an airplane and without windows of any kind. Her mother as well as the doctor who examined the girl felt that she could not have received a normal sunburn during the few minutes she was outdoors. The doctor found membrane in-

Inflammation of both eyes and first-degree burns under the eyes and on the nose.

Police interviewed the girl at length and had her draw the silvery object which she had seen in the sky. Several other children saw it too, at the same time, but did not watch as long.

The above incident caused an unprecedented warning to Albuquerque residents from their police chief, A. B. Martinez. The chief asked that all youngsters, - and everyone, for that matter, - stay away from mysterious objects. He gave no hint as to what he thinks UFO's really are, but stated that if they are sighted by Albuquerque residents, they should be "treated with respect and caution until more information as to their identity is available."
