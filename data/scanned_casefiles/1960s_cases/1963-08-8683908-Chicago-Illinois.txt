Northbrook Aviator Explains
Those 'Mysterious' Lights

"Strange Lights" reportedly seen last week in several sections of Illinois were as an electric advertising sign behind a plane, says the Northbrook pilot who flew the craft.

Robert Burmeister, 1708 Maple road, said he was "polishing the lights" at 7-1,000." George Priester is owner of the airport and the aviator.

Unless the viewer is directly beneath the area appears to be a public light because the message is flashed across the sky.

Mr. Burmeister said reports of "unidentified flying objects" have been received before in areas over which he made night flights via the sky.

Dr. Allen J. Hynek, director of Northwestern University's Dearborn Observatory, supported Mr. Burmeister's statements.

Date: August 11, 1963

Description indicates a possible aurora sighting. Positional data furnished is confusing. Obj reported in the North between the Moon and the North Star. Moon is at 23.45 almost 24° on the Horizon in the East at the reported time. No bright astro body is in the area reported. Auroral displays were common during the early days of the month. Insufficient data prevented to conclusive this analysis.

Dear Dr. Hynek,

I have just written a letter during the night that tells me that I was seeing a flying object. I was not able to place the origin of this object. I believe my statement is true. I will make the news fact.

Northbrook Action Explains
Those "Mysteries" Lights

August 13, 1963

"Strange lights" reportedly seen last week in several sections of Illinois were an electric rotating sign behind a plane, a Northbrook pilot said.

Robert Burmeister, 1700 N. Wisner, Northbrook, pilot, which has 250 light bulbs over the area, were seen.

Briefly, the viewer is interested in seeing the sign as it appears to be a series of rolling lights.

The pilot said Mr. Aviation employee of Friester Aviation Co. Milwaukee, Wis., who flies a Cessna 170 plane, saw the lights near Peter Aviation - Leavenworth base.

Mr. Adam Kluck, owner of the airport and the aviator, said records of the manifested object show he was well in night flights with Mr. Friester.

Mr. Allen Dyrek, director of the University of Illinois airport, said Mr. Friester's statement is pertinent.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

After the flying object had come visible it floated or sailed much faster than it had when first sighted. My chronology and I seem to agree that in hovering almost to a standstill the object was perhaps not lost its strength and was either seeking energy or trying to generate power; and as soon as it had gained more power from what, we do not know, then it was able to ascend and spread up. Its all other discussion is to how people have described it closely others seem (Came into a Car). Perhaps this object might to gain the attraction this particular might to gain the view. Might and speed. It could not have been seen by anybody other than persons directly along our alley and it seemed this object which allowed it to ride above the third floor level, after it had lifted and alley. 7-8 minutes (E:40) for some minutes had passed out of sight - it was then decided to see if this object had come to a location on the documentary things.

When I looked at the moon which was bright and full that night, I decided to see a moon but a beautiful ornate cross with a trail of light extending down ward. There was a blaze of light behind it. But no more. The lines of the cross were prominent. The light was behind the cross and it was a bright yellow. This lasted awhile and then disappeared. The moon was very transparent. It didn't seem to much patch yellow than before. It didn't affect the stars. It was about a half hour later in some night-cluttered. The moon was high and at the plowing north at the time we called about the registration infer.
