Remarks: At about 0309, 5 June, 1954, when was at a cottage at Crystal Lake, 60 miles south of Lansing, with her husband and 10-year-old sister, she was studying history in the cottage living room. Her brother had left, saying he was going to the island across the lake to the north, and saw a bright flash of light near an island about 200 yards out. The noise immediately ceased, and, after a moment, she heard it return. About ten minutes later, the noise faded away, and became longer and louder, waking the younger sister. The younger sister became very frightened, and tried to escape into bed with her mother and took no further part in the observations. She saw the front (north) yard of the cottage lighted up brightly, as well as the bordering in the water. On such sides the water was black indicating deep sides, and when she opened the window to look out, it became so loud that she had to cover her ears. While she was at the window, an "enormous" circular object sailing into her view over her head, going north toward the island she had seen for about 60 seconds. The object seemed to be maneuvering and she felt it gave an impression of some kind of projection on top, possibly dome-shaped, and of another projection on the bottom around the lights, possibly ventricles. After it went around and passed low over the island at about the same altitude, it did not shimmer or "burn" as it went, but seem to keep the same faint familiar glowing. She was initially questioned by her father, who said that he had instructed her with the seriousness of making a false report. He said that he would investigate further.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing an interview about a UFO sighting incident.

The text in the document states:

had spent several years in the Air Force, and knew about project blue book. The morning after the sighting (actually the same day) 1) picked out on the family Hammond Organ the high notes and said the object was "just like waves picks up" This person was D where middle G was lifted by 2 investigator during the interview (his identity had been a week before). There was a roaring noise, but the predominant, and painfully loud sound was odd, like a buzz. Mr. 1) said that he had tried to estimate the size of the object from Lota's description of it and his knowledge of the distance of the island, and came out with a diameter of roughly forty feet. From the time the object descended to the time it made the violent disconcerting reverse turn, Mr. 1) estimates at about twenty seconds. The noise definitely could be heard getting louder and louder for several seconds - perhaps five - before the object appeared in the scene. Immediately after the sighting, 1) found herself completely alone, and was extremely frightened. She went outside, since she could not switch her radio, to see if anyone else was on or if anyone else had seen what was happening, but found no one, all the cottages were dark. In fact, nearly everyone else had already returned home after the weekend, and most of the cottages were deserted.

This interview was conducted entirely by telephone; unfortunately the investigators went to Lansing, the1) could not be reached by telephone, and they were probably gone for the weekend.

Mr. 1) volunteered to return to the cottage and inspect the area; he also said he would contact a local supermarket owner who knows many residents of the resort area to see if he had heard of any other people who might have seen or heard the phenomenon.

It is unfortunate that Miss 1) could not arrive on the scene more quickly to do intensive investigation, since proximity is usually so important in these cases. But it seems clear that there was a highly unusual phenomenon observed by several reliable witnesses.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a handwritten report text that describes a sighting of a bright flashing object over Crystal Lake, Michigan. The text states that the witness was a 14-year-old girl who observed the object for about 10 minutes before it disappeared. It also mentions that the witness could not get details because of the brightness of the light.

9 june 1964, 10:00 est, 14-year old girl heard noisy, very bright flash on island in lake near cottage where she was staying. 10 minutes later, noise again, loud roar with predominant note at about 600 cps, bright light and front yard brightly illuminated. Disappeared objects then reappeared from behind and overhead, went forth over lake, illuminating plane water, then behind and light continued until object was out of sight. Been hard to get details because of brightness of light. Crystal Lake, CO miles southeast of Larimer, Colorado.

EXTRACT FROM SGT MOODY'S TRIP REPORT TO LANSING, MICHIGAN AREA

It was learned that the FAA in Lansing turned over control of flight to operators from 0800 to 0900 for a classified military operation. Rogge (Sgt Roeser) the SVDTC site director, was on duty and made arrangements with the FAA for the military operation.

Local weather data was obtained for 13 June and used in the investigation.

The discussion with the tower operators James Mackey on UFO's and the lighting observations in the area when many calls are received by the tower operators. The operators usually explain the observations to callers as known electrical installations which can obstruct the view of the entire area.

A flight of F-86? Sgt Moody returned to the motel. 

On the morning of 13 Jun 64, Sgt Moody proceeded from East Lansing, Michigan to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and contacted Sgt Larson of the AFROTC. Sgt Larson directed Sgt Moody to the University Lighting control room where measurements were being made during daylight hours of illumination.

Sgt Moody proceeded to the hangar where Michigan University astrophysical equipment was stored. He was shown various astronomical observation equipment but was not able to determine any relationship to the Ann Arbor Airport operations.

This indicates that the conducte investigation at the Ann Arbor Airport had no flights in the Lansing area during the 23-25 May period. Mr. Smith also indicated that there had been no flight activity except that which was observed by photo activity, etc., during this period.

Smith was contacted by telephone and he indicated that his company had the FAA weather data for the Lansing area. He was advised that it had been examined and found good, so his company records would not be required. 

This confirms that the flight of an F-86 observed in the Michigan area in about 2305-2330 in 15 May was the last flight in Michigan area. There was no other flight activity in the Lansing area during the period.

At 2330 Sgt Moody proceeded to the capitol city airport at Lansing and contacted Major Robert Moyer, Director of Civil Defense Operations regarding the landing sightings in the Lansing area. Moyer stated that this sighting was reported to him about 2330 earlier in the evening and that he had been trying to contact the airport to get an aircraft airborne to investigate. However, he didn't know the purpose or the operations, nor was he able to make any investigation as to the nature of the objects. He stated that he had been advised that this sighting was made by a Mr. Fred Hazard, news reporter for this paper. No additional information was obtainable.

From the State Journal office Sgt Moody proceeded to battle creek.

CONCLUSION, LANSING, MICHIGAN

Results of the field investigation in the Lansing, Michigan and surrounding area lead to the conclusion that an aircraft or aircraft under control of the U.S.A.F. Detroit Defense Area was the probable source of the sightings with radar, visual, and infrared photography.

The gelatinous material was attributed to the area and flashes reflecting from ground vegetation which is believed to be the cause.

The sightings of 22 May were attributed to meteor observations and on the night of 23 May are believed to be meteor observations.

The object observed on 25 May by______________ is believed to have been the planet Venus.

The sighting of 26 May by__________ is regarded as an unreliable report.

The sighting of Mr.____________ on 27 May resembles a reported observation of the moon.

The sighting on 2 Jun at Crystal Lake, Michigan by__________ is believed to have been caused by an infra-red photo mission.

The observation on 5 Jun near Lansing, Michigan is believed to have been an aircraft in normal flight.

The sighting on 13 Jun at Grand Ledge, Michigan__________ is regarded as a reflection of one individual on fog.

The report from Mrs.____________ included leaves as a physical specimen. It is believed that these leaves were the result of the sound of the A/C observed by others in this report but that the leaves were any way associated with this event. Subsequent analysis revealed that these leaves are normal vegetation.
