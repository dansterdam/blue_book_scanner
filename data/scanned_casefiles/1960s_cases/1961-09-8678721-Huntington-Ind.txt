Huntington, Ind.
September 4, .61

Dear Sir:

Several nights I have been observing the sky, I have seen a moving object. Could you please tell me what it may be? It shines about like Echo, it also appears in the west about the same place, one would see Echo in the low North I believe you call it, but then instead of going across the sky into the east, it travels south, at the same time every other night approximately 9:05 sighting and out of sight at 9:15 the time differential convinces me, it is not Echo.

the change of travel also does not line up. Sooooooo what is it?

Thanking you for your time
Mrs.
Huntington, Ind.

I do miss seeing Echo. Can you give me a time to look, and is the 20 some odd minutes before or after for the next night sighting?

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

23 October 1961

Dear Mrs.

Your recent letter to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been referred to the Air Force for reply.

I have enclosed a questionnaire which we would appreciate your filling out and mailing to us in the enclosed pre-addressed, envelope which requires no postage.

We do not have an Echo satellite schedule at the moment. However, this schedule is sent to the wire services for passing to the news media throughout the nation. I would recommend that you contact your local newspaper and request they run this schedule, or if they cannot do this, to give you the information so that you may look for the satellites. The period of orbit, apogee and perigee, vary, as you know.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
Major, USAF
UFO Project Officer
Public Information Division
Office of Information

Mrs.
Huntington, Indiana
