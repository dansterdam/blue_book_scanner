35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

THE LIGHTS were quite ERRATIC in their BINKING.
THERE was no SOUND as would BE with a PLANE.

WE STAYED out LATE near the SIGHTING and SAW
A JET and a SMALL BICOLOR Go over. THERE
was no COMPARISON to the SIGHTED OBJECT.

THE OBJECTS were too LOW to BE AIRCRAFT AND
also TOO CLOSE together. WITH the two PLANES
that went over there was a lot of SOUND, BUT
these OBJECTS made no SOUND at all. IT was the
type of NIGHT that SOUND would HAVE traveled
a LONG way.

You have my permission to use any of this
INFORMATION in any PUBLICATIONS and are to use
my NAME. This is as close to a perfect description
as is possible for me to give.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.
