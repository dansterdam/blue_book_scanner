DIRECTLY OVERHEAD ON A COURSE
DESCENDING THAN LOST
TO OBSERVATION BECAUSE OF TREES.
ITS APPEARANCE WHEN OVER HEAD
WAS QUITE UNLIKE ECHO BUT ITS
SPEED WAS ABOUT 3 TIMES AS FAST,
ITS ALTITUDE ABOUT THE SAME.
DURATION OF VISIBILITY APPROX TWO
MINUTES. THERE WERE NO CONTROLS
OR SOUND WAVES. ABOUT 10 MIN
LATER ECHO 1 MADE ITS APPEARANCE
ON A NW TO SE COURSE. THE
WEATHER WAS CLEAR, THE SKY
CLOUDLESS. I HOPE THIS INFORMATION
WILL BE HELPFUL IN STUDIES OF
UFO. PLEASE EXCUSE PAPER AND
PENCIL BUT AS WE ARE ROUGHING
