DIRECTLY OVERHEAD ON A COURSE DUE SOUTH AND WAS THEN LOST
TO OBSERVATION BECAUSE OF TREES.
ITS APPEARANCE WHEN OVERHEAD WAS NOT UNLIKE ECHO BUT ITS 
SPEED WAS ABOUT 8 TIMES AS FAST.
ITS ALTITUDE ABOUT THE SAME.
DURATION OF VISIBILITY APPROX TWO MINUTES. THERE WERE NO CONTRAILS
OR SOUND WAVES.ABOUT 10 MINS LATER ECHO 1 MADE ITS APPEARANCE

CLOUDLESS. I HOPE THIS INFORMATION WILL BE HELPFUL IN STUDIES OF 
UFO. PLEASE EXCUSE PAPER AND PENCIL BUT AS WE ARE ROUGHING 
IT OUR FACILITIES ARE NOT THE BEST.
