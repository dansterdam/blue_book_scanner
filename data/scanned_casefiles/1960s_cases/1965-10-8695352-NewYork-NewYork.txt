The conditions were very bad due to haze and interfering light from fair. Nevertheless, I doubt if the objects were birds being we also saw birds -illuminated by ground light and flying as birds should. The motion resembled that of objects in fast-double rotation.

Dear Sir,

On October 14, 7:23 p.m. this party was an outdoor photo play near was studying near us, saw a series of flying objects over New York near the World's Fair.

Let me give you a description for all its worth:

They were a total of about 12 elliptical weightless objects which speeded in a northerly direction in a quickly changing V formation, returned in a circular easily moving circular formation at 7.24 p.m. then they were 12 in number, returned once more at 7:30 p.m. in an irregular formation, one or two detached itself in another crazy motion.

The temperature was about 55-60 degrees, the wind speed on the ground was 10 miles/hour.

[Redacted street name], New York or [Redacted location] made a photograph of these objects, or light phenomena.

It is the third time that I have seen similar motion, and it is certainly quite possible to achieve that kind of seemingly erratic flight with objects manufactured on earth, and if indeed our observations are correct, the possibilities in terms of speed and acceleration could be of the fantastic.

I would be interested to hear if any other reports of this occurrence have reached you.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:     Dec 2     1965
                                               Day     Month    Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Camera Used was a Minolta SR-7 with 58 mm 1.4 Auto Rokkor. Film used was Ektachrome x (ASA 64)

Exposure 1/15 Sec at 1.9 (wide open)    processing normal

Due to almost imperceptible brightness it seems objects were at least 2000 feet. They seemed to have the speed and maneuverability of Supreme Fighters however if the altitude was as high as it seemed then speed could easily have been as high as 3000 mph, due to the extremely short duration of appearance. Speed remained constant throughout their appearance. One object on the right side seemed to peel off to the right and immediately after which all objects disappeared from view. Judging from my past experience I did not expect these photos to be usable. I decided to depend on a little "luck". One of the enclosed pictures is a blank - The other three are attempts to photograph the objects. I regret that they are not of better quality. It is not necessary to return slides, since they are of no use to me. To provide you with directions of travel etc.

I consulted a map of New York and another of the world's

Dear

Your report of a group of unidentified flying objects observed at the New York World's Fair on October 14 by you and your wife resembles a flight of birds. However, it seems unlikely that such a common phenomenon would be maintained unless there was some unusual circumstances associated with the observation. Would you and your wife please complete the attached Form 164a in order that I may have a more complete analysis may be made. We are enclosing envelopes for their return at your convenience.

Sincerely,
