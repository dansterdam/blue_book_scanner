Routes 22l - 14, followed object to Conway, Pa. for about 80 miles. 
Object seemed to be taking off from ground, along shaped, with antenna 
projecting from it. There were no colored lights only a very bright 
silvery radiance. Object flying about 500 feet over vehicle. It 
would show down in speed and then go very fast. The glow from object 
was so bright it blinded driver of vehicle. Object was flying due east. 
This was witnessed by people along the route between Ravenna, Ohio and 
Conway, Pa. There were three (3) men from sheriff's office and two (2) 
patrol cars that followed object along this route."

2. After the report was received a call was made to the Airport Tower 
at Greater Pittsburgh Airport. Nothing had been picked up on radar at 
the airport. The Air National Guard, also located at Greater Pittsburgh 
Airport had been called but not by this organization. F-102's were not 
scrambled to follow the UFO.

3. Mr. Tom Schley, Beaver County Times, called 0815 hours 18 Apr 66 
requesting info on UFO. He mentioned that a photo of the UFO had been 
taken. Local news media published the fact that a photo of the UFO had

SUBJECT: UFO (Mantua, Ohio)

ANALYST: Major Quintanilla     PTL: Lt Benson     DATE: 22 Apr 66

1. Both "images" fall into the same frame area.

2. Neither of the mind density images are distinct enough to analyze. Average background density 1.25. "Image density" 1.06.

3. If the object was "bright" against a dark sky the images should be plus density - they are not.

4. The entire roll of film is severely fogged which could cover up much detail.

5. The marks in the framing area of the film are outside the field of view of the lens, therefore, they could't be images.

6. UFO's are probably processing defects due to old fogged film and poor handling.

Y66-14

SUBJECT: UFO (Mantua, Ohio)

ANALYST: Major Quintanilla

1. Data "Images" 5.11 into the same frame.

2. Neither of the nine's density images are distinct enough to fairly average background density 1.25. "Image density" 1.06.

3. If the object was "bright" against a dark sky the image should be plus density - they are not.

4. The entire roll of film is severely fogged which could cover up much detail.

5. The marks in the framing area of the film are outside the field of view of the lens, therefore, they couldn't be images.

6. UFO's are probably processing defects due to old fogged film and poor handling.

Chief Gerald Buchert
Mantua Police Department
Mantua, Ohio 44255

Dear Chief Buchert,

The most probable cause of the object which you were trying to photograph was the planet Venus and this was the reason that you were unable to photograph it with your camera. In order to photograph Venus, you would have had to photograph it with a time exposure. This cannot be done with the type of camera you were using.

Thank you for your cooperation and your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

CONVERSATION WITH COLONEL HENDRICKS, YOUNGSTOWN RESERVE 19 Apr 66.

We have been erroneously quoted by the AP, also have been falsely quoted. Have had no contact with the news media. In the initial release of a plane being two fast or two slow, nothing. I have attempted this morning to find out who in the organization may have had contact. Could find no one. News media had called last night and were informed that they had no information. Spoke with the writer of the Cleveland Plain Dealer (Bloomfield) who claims the Air Force planes were too fast. He doesn't know where the info came from. They are querying the AP wires. Youngstown did not have any aircraft airborne. Major asked him if there were any other units close. Air Force information flight in Cleveland.

Gave him Sara's number in Washington to call so she could inform the Colonel up there and so she could squelch the news that they had a/c aloft, when actually they did not.

Object seemed to take off from ground, oblong, shaped with antenna projecting from it. There were no colored lights only a very bright silvery radiance, object flying 500 feet over vehicle. It would slow down and speed up and then go very fast. The glow was so bright it blinded the driver of the vehicle. Object going due East. Witnessed by people from Ravenna and Conway. Three more from Sheriff's office. Two cars followed object along this route. Dep Sheriff Dale F. Spaur, was observer. Pittsburgh didn't send up any aircraft. Have flying box cars 119, is all they have. Air National Guard was contacted to scramble their 102's but they didn't since nothing showed up on radar. The 102's were not scrambled.

They belong to the Air National Guard. The release on the sighting was broke from the Sheriff's office at East Palestine, Ohio and Conway, Pa. He has tried to contact the police at Conway and Rochester, Pa. They refuse to give the AF any information.

Pittsburgh did not release anything to the press. To his knowledge the Air National Guard did not release any information. The responsibility is the Air Force's so they take it.

PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH BILL POWERS AT NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,
18 APRIL 1966.

s made some phone calls. Called Portage County.
were in conference. On state route 14 noticed a lighted
object going down behind woods. While they were out of squad car.
Stopped over the car. Bright enough, it was like daylight.
Called the home radio base in Ravenna. Asked them what to do.
Told him to keep calm and keep it under observation. When it took
down highway they followed. He didn't get any
pictures. Followed it, in radio contact with home base. They
clocked it for 10 miles, they were driving 83-84 mph. Got near
East Palestine, contacted a man in Police, Wayne Houston. It very
high speeds. Lost it going across river and finally stopped at
Convey. On route 14, almost all the way, into the rea
of Elecripa. Went until Conway. Another Police car and somebody
was watching the object. He turned around and went back home.
Houston heard the radio contacts going on and was listening, getting
within 10 miles established contact. He didn't see until they were
five miles away. It was traveling down going SE. He got his car
and joined it and described: "Top traveling sideways". Very bright
with no special lights. No markings, no turning,. As they went
into Rochester, thought they saw an antenna. Powers thought we
should send someone down to get the right directions. Thought
one critical point was when Houston first saw the object. Saw it
come over the trees, only five miles. There is some confusion
getting near dawn. By getting over Pennsylvania. They probably
started out with a real object, they actually lost it and then saw
Venus. All they would see was tiny bright light in sky. None


- page 42 -

noticed other stats..

Mr and Mrs [redacted] in Conway saw object. Powers had talked to them. As far as he could tell they saw Venus. The Taylor's would look again and see if it was Venus. SPaur had the impression that there was a police car in Conway watching object.

REPORT BY TELEPHONE CONVERSATION 18 Apr 66

POLICEMAN GERALD BUCHERT, MANTUA, OHIO AREA CODE 216, phone 274-2251

He had called Lt Weisinger, FTD Duty Officer on 17 Apr 66. I have several prints and negative. The Lt said not to release them. Major explained that he was free to release them or do whatever he wished to do with them. He said the Lt didn't exactly say not to release them but said to hold onto them. Major explained to him that we would like to have the negatives so that we could blow them up.

Said he would send them registered mail and asked that we send him a letter stating that we got them. Major explained that he was the officer in charge of the project. Buchert said he wasn't too sure how he should go about reporting his observation. Had a Deacon lens, with fixed lens at 14. No speed, 127 Black and White, thought it was Ansco film. Observed object for 15-20 minutes.

It was stopped, didn't appear to be moving, when it did move then went up and down and went back to its same position, left to the right, like it was tilting, went SE, on state route 44. The pictures were taken in front of my farm. Major explained that he could do whatever he wanted to do with the film as far as releasing goes, he could even sell them. Buchert said he would feel kind of silly. He would send them to us registered mail along with his police report. Said it wasn't a star, plane, or balloon. Looks like two saucers in prints. One object. Major told him we would send him an official report.

REPORT BY TELEPHONE CONVERSATION 18 APRIL 1966

SHERIFF SPAUR, RAVENNA, OHIO.

0506 when I got back from my cruiser, I was checking an abandoned vehicle on 224, very bright light, first attracted. Came from West in an eastern direction, passed over us to the North side of the highway. I believe there was a partial moon due East of us. There was one other object like a star, right of the moon on South of moon at 3 o'clock. The only shape was the roundness of it, unperfect circle, egg shaped, almost like oblong, but not real oblong. So bright that we couldn't look directly at it. It came out of a deep wooded area. Came from the West towards us.

We just disregarded it at first. Just a routine patrol. Partner he also observed it. He was to the right of the car. Thought someone might come walking out of the woods. Waited to make sure no one was walking behind us. Very low on the horizon. Theother car was watching it from two roads above it. It was not more than 150 feet over the one area. Didn't have a red light. No wind.

When it came over us it lighted the whole area. The ground was lighted by this object. Like looking at arc welder, blue-white light. The only sound heard was a humming sound like a power transformer, no thrust like from a jet. No sudden surge of power. It went to the north side of the road. Angled slightly, bottom came across 224 on the south side of road, started going East. Slow movement. We ran back and had a camera. Kept under surveillance till it could be possibly photographed. Those were our instructions after we had called in. The Mantua Police had photographed the object. We have a copy from Mantua. Major Quintanilla explained

NORTHEASTERN, OHIO

Photo Analysis, of the negative submitted by Chief of Police Gerald F. Buchert, Mantua, Ohio, indicates that the "very bright light" which he tried to photograph does not appear as an image. The two images which appear on the negative are probably the result of processing defects due to old fogged film and poor handling. If the object was "bright" against a dark sky the images should be plus density, however, they were not. The average background density was 1.25, the image density was 1.06.

The probable cause of the sighting by Deputy Sheriff Spaur of Ravenna, Ohio was the passage of a satellite over northeastern Ohio. As the satellite approached the southeast portion of the sky, the satellite disappeared and Deputy Sheriff Dale F. Spaur focused his eyes on the planet Venus. Venus was rising in the southeast and was at a magnitude of -3.9 which would be brighter than other stars in the sky. It is believed that Deputy Sheriff Spaur was chasing the planet Venus. Radar indicates that no airborne objects were in the area of the sighting during the period that Deputy Sheriff Spaur was chasing the UFO.

Leads Sheriff
On Fast Chase

RAVENNA, Ohio (AP) - "We were close, closer than I ever want to be again," said a deputy sheriff who chased an unidentified flying object from Ohio into Pennsylvania.

Hundreds of persons in both states reported seeing the "brilliant and shiny" object early Sunday morning.

Police Chief Gerald Buchert of Mantua, about eight miles north of Ravenna, said he took a picture of the object from his front yard but the Air Force told him not to release it.

Deputy Sheriff Dale Spaur said he and his partner, W. L. Neff, "were close" to the object in separate cars and chased it 86 miles for an hour and a half.

(Continued On Page 3, Col. 7)

from near Ravenna to Conway, Pa., near Pittsburgh.

Spaur said he clocked it at up to 100 miles per hour.

From the ground Spaur said it looked like the head of a flashlight, about 10 feet wide and 18 feet high.

Spaur said the lines of the object were very distinct. "Somebody had control over it," he said. "It wasn't just floating around. It can maneuver."

The deputy said the chase began down near Rochester, Pa., when the cars "got tangled up." He said it was as though when I came out from under the bridge it came down and waited for us, just as though it knew these two cars were following it."

"I know nobody's going to believe it, but it's true," he said.

Spaur said the only sound coming from the object was a steady, faint humming like an electric transformer. Near Conway, Pa., Spaur said the object began hovering and "was going for altitude, straight up."

He said he object disappeared after he and others went to a police station to telephone Air Force officials.

The Federal Aviation Agency's air traffic control center at Oberlin, Ohio, and Pittsburgh said they had spotted no unknown objects on their radar.

UFO Near Reading
READING, Pa. (UPI) — A family in suburban Fleetwood reported they watched an unidentified flying object (UFO) hovering near their home for more than an hour early Sunday.

Mr. and Mrs. Harold Lebo said the object emitted no sounds but changed colors from bright yellow to red and blue. Lebo said he called his three sons to the window and they watched the object through a small telescope. They said it rose slowly until it was high in the sky and appeared like a morning star before it vanished in the sunrise.

Dear Bill,

When I recently served in Washington as the Congressman from the 11th District, I was often amazed at the number and variety of letters I would receive from certain of my constituents complaining about the action or inaction of various Federal officials or employees.

However, as a result of recent events here in Portage County, I believe I now better understand why citizens write their Congressman when upset with certain federal personnel.

I am writing to complain about the attitude and actions of representatives of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Field in reference to reports of U F O sightings in Portage County. On April 17th at about 3:00 A.M. two deputies of the Portage County Sheriff's office, Dale Spaur and Wilbur Neff, and the Chief of Police of Mantua, Gerald Buchert, reported that they observed an object in the air over Portage County and the two deputies stated that they chased this object some 85 miles before they were forced to give up their pursuit!

Deputies Spaur and Neff said that they had a good look at the object and at times it was within 100 feet of them. Chief Buchert took a picture of what he saw from a greater distance.

Several police officers along the 85 mile route taken by the Portage County officers confirm their report.

It is my understanding that units of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Field are charged by the United States Air Force with the responsibility to investigate reports of Unidentified Flying Objects in this area.

It is my further understanding that their investigation of these sightings has merely consisted of telephone conversations with several of the eye witnesses and an examination of the photographs taken by Chief Buchert.

Flying Saucer Chased
By Law for 86 Miles

RAVENNA, Ohio (AP) — "We were close, closer than I ever want to be again," said a deputy sheriff who chased an unidentified flying object from Ohio into Pennsylvania.

Hundreds of persons in both states reported seeing the "brilliant and shiny" object early Sunday morning.

Police chief Gerald Buchert of Mantua, about eight miles north of Ravenna, said he took a picture of the object from his front yard but the Air Force told him not to release it.

Spokesman for Project Blue-book, the Air Force UFO headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, said the base's officer of the day made the request to Buchert. The spokesman also said no picture or report had reached the Blue-book office yet.

Buchert said it looked like "two table saucers put together."

Deputy Sheriff Dale Spaur said he and his partner, W. L. Neff, "were close" to the object in separate cars and chased it for 86 miles for an hour and a half, from near Ravenna to Conway, Pa., near Pittsburgh.

Spaur said he clocked it at speeds up to 103 miles per hour. From the ground Spaur said it looked like the head of a flashlight, about 40 feet wide and 18 feet high.

Spaur said the lines of the object were very distinct. "Somehow had control over it," he said. "It wasn't just floating around. It can maneuver."

The deputy said the chase slowed down near Rochester, Pa., when the cars "got tangled up in a mess of bridges. But when I came out from under the bridge it came down and waited for us, just as though it knew these two cars were following it."

DARK OBJECT SAID TO BE PICTURE OF UFO NEAR RAVENNA
Mantua Police Chief Took Shot While Following Object—UPI

This Saucer Had
Large Red Light

BENTON HARBOR, Mich. Apr. 20—(UPI)—Police
Chief Merle McCarnell said Monday he and his wife
watched a silent flying object with a "large red dome
light" from their home Saturday night.
His report followed that of
other Benton Harbor residents
who said they saw a strange
flying object during the week
end.

"WE WERE LOOKING out
the front window and my wife
remarked, 'look at that large
airplane and how low it is,'"
McCarnell said. "I looked and I
said, 'that's not an airplane.'"

"Then we went out the front
door where we could get a
better view. It was floating
along but there was no noise, no
sound at all."

"It was very low, probably
100-150 feet off the ground. It
disappeared behind the build-
ings and trees and we could-
see it no longer.

"IT DEFINITELY wasn't an
airplane. It did have a large red
dome light on it that was blinking, and other lights around it.
We couldn't determine just
exactly the shape of it."

Two girls at Lake Michigan
beach, a Benton Harbor suburb,
reported a similar sighting
Saturday night.

Someone in Control,
Sheriff Says of UFO

RAVENNA, Ohio (AP)—"We were close, close than I ever want to be again," said a deputy sheriff who chased an unidentified flying object from cars and chased it 36 miles for an hour and a half, from near Ravenna to Conway, Pa., near Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh Post Gazette, April 18, 1966

UFO Almost Makes It to Pittsburgh
'Saucer' Flies From Ohio to Pa.

An Unidentified Flying Object (Flying Saucer to you, Charlie) shaped like an ice cream cone almost made it to Pittsburgh yesterday, but apparently got headed off at the pass by some overzealous Ohio policemen.

A "very bright, cone-shaped object, some 35 to 45 feet across the top and about 24 feet high," was first spotted south of Akron, Ohio, by Portage County Sheriff's Deputy W. L. Neff, who gave the above description, about 5 a.m.

He added that the object, which seemed to be able to navigate by itself, gave off a faint humming noise.

This greatly interested Deputy Neff, who reportedly be-lieves in flying saucers, and he took up the chase southward along U.S. Routes 42 and 14 at speeds ranging from 80 to 100 miles an hour.

Near East Palestine, Ohio, he was joined by an East Palestine deputy police officer, Wayne Huston, also on patrol, and the two of them followed the object across the state line into Pennsylvania, near Conway, Beaver County. They lost it.

But hundreds of other people had sighted the object and this time and calls were coming in to police switchboards as well as to an Air Force Reserve unit near Youngstown and to the Federal Aviation Agency at Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

Pilots were up in jet trainers almost immediately from the Youngstown base, but complained that the object—described of which was estimated at just over 100 miles an hour—was moving too slowly for them to keep up with it or down.

Clever saucer, playing our own technology off against us...!

At Greater Pittsburgh Airport the radar screen. A Federal Aviation Agency official there said late in the morning that there weren't any airplanes, either in the area or where the saucer was sighted—at least not at 5 o'clock in the morning.

Conway police said they neither heard nor saw any UFO and weren't about to speak of it, and wished in general that newsmen would stop bothering them.

With the coming of full daylight, apparently, the saucer faded—or flew—or teleported away, leaving us earthlings to sort the whole thing out.

FLYING OBJECT

(3605) FLYING OBJECT, APRIL 28 (U)--THE AIR FORCE SAID TODAY A FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED HIGH AT OHIO PROPERTY SIGHTED WAS CHARGED TO A SATELLITE.

THE AIR FORCE SAID A GROUND OBSERVER AT THE RAVENNA, OHIO, ARSENAL REPORTED SIGHTING A FLYING OBJECT MOVING ACROSS THE SKY AT 1:30 P.M. WEDNESDAY.

DIRECTING - DEVELOPING THE PICTURE, THE AIR FORCE SAID THE OBJECT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A SATELLITE OF SPACE OF RAVENNA, OHIO.

GROUND OBSERVER SAID HE AND HIS BROTHER CHASED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SOME 4 MILES.

GROUND SAID WHEN I WOULD THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE THE HEAD OF A FLASHLIGHT THEN ITS LIGHT'S WERE VERY DISTINCT, AND THAT SOON IT WOULD CHANGE.

THE AIR FORCE SAID THEIR STATUS CAN USE PROBABLY THE PASSAGE OF A SATELLITE.

IT WAS THE SATELLITE APPROACH WHICH SOUTHWEST PORTION OF THE SKY WAS DISASSEMBLED, AND SHORTLY SPARK FOCUSED NO SITE OF THE PLANE.

WHICH WAS RISING IN THE SOUTHWEST AND WAS AT A MAGNITUDE WHICH COULD BE SEEN IN THE SKY. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THESE INDICATIONS SUGGEST THESE OBJECTS WERE IN THE AREA OF THE RAVENNA ARSENAL.

POLICE CHIEF GERALD STEWART OF MANTUA, OHIO, ABOUT EIGHT MILES WEST OF RAVENNA, SAID THE OBJECT WHICH HE SAID LOOKED LIKE "TWO TABLE SAUCERS PUT TOGETHER."

BUCHTEL SAID THE AIR TO TOLD HIS NOT TO RELEASE THE PICTURE, BUT AN FORCE BRITISH PRESS CORRELATING ON BUCHTEL'S CLAIM THE AIR FORCE SAID "WE PHOTOGRAPHICALLY INVESTIGATE THE NEGATIVE INDICATES THAT THE VERY BRIGHT LIGHT WHICH IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS DOES NOT APPEAR AS LIGHT."

THE TWO MAKERS WHICH APPEAR ON THE NEGATIVE ARE PROBABLY THE RESULT OF PROCESSING DEFECTS DUE TO OLD FOGGED FILM AND POOR HANDLING.

DOZENS OF PERSONS IN BOTH OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA REPORTED SEEING A "BRILLIANT AND SHINY OBJECT IN THE SKY EARLY SUNDAY MORNING."

THE AIR FORCE DID NOT COMMENT ON THIS.

OBJECT DISAPPEARS NEAR CONWAY

UFO Chased Into County

By TOM SCHLEY
TIMES Staff
An 8-mile high-speed chase
after an unidentified flying object (UFO) ended in Conway
Sunday morning early as two
deputies from Portage County,
Conway Patrolman Frank
Panzarella said he saw that
prompted two sheriff's deputies and a policeman from
Ohio to drive at speeds up to
116 miles per hour in pursuit of the "flying saucer."

The two deputies from Portage County, Ohio, Dale Spear
and W. L. Neff, began the chase
shortly after 5 a.m. on Ohio
Route 224 near Atwater, south
of Akron and southeast of Ravenna, the Portage County seat.

At about the same time, Panzarella said he was in Mantua, Ohio, snapped a photo
of the object from some distance while he and his wife stood
in their front yard about 10 miles
north of Ravenna.

Spear and Neff, on instructions, pursued the brightly lighted object along Ohio Route 14.
They were joined at East Palestine by Patrolman Wayne
Houts of that city in another
police cruiser.

The two cars sped on into
Pennsylvania, down Route 51
to Rochester and then on Route
65 to Conway. At Conway they
spotted Panzarella in his parked
cruiser at a service station.
They stopped there since Spear

was running low on gas. He
also had burned a new set of
tires held from the high speed
chase.

The three Ohio men said
Panzarella is the first person
they pointed it out.

In them, he had seen it a few
minutes earlier from the top
of 13th Street hill but hadn't
though much about it at that
time.

(Continued From Page 1)

that when he first saw the brightly lighted object it was reflecting light from the hill before the Ohio state line arrival before the Ohio state line.

He called the Akron Airport and Pittsburgh Airport contacted, and the four men watched for about 20 minutes. The object rose "straight up" until it was barely visible.

Spaur and Panzarella both said they had heard that the object was a flying saucer. They chased the object. There were reports that jet trainers from Youngstown went up but the object, traveling about 100 miles an hour, kept ahead of them and continued them to stay with it.

A Federal Aviation Agency official at Greater Pittsburgh Airport said the object wasn't picked on radar nor were there any planes in the area where the object was sighted.

The four men viewing from Conway said a plane then apparently took off from the airport and passed right through the object. They said they watched object; they were watching.

Air Force personnel at the airport would make no statement about the sighting other than to refer inquiries to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, had been notified. Official Air Force Investigations.

SPAUR, 35, a former Air Force gunner, and Neff were chasing the object along the highway and directly over the patrol car at about 150 feet above them.

He said the bottom of the object was a glowing red and the light from the bottom was so bright it was almost like daylight. It lighted up the area around the car like daylight. Spaur said the object was directly over the car at the bright white light when it was shining on them.

Spaur said the object had no apparent effect on him and Neff or on the car. It was about 35 feet to 40 feet across and about 35 to 40 feet high, he said.

Spaur said he became frightened and he and Neff ran for the car. He reported the object to police headquarters in Ravenna and was told to keep the object under surveillance.

MEANWHILE, Chief Buchert in Mantua had monitored a report to Portage County from Suffield that a strange object was in Akron about a strange light that had been pointed out.

Buchert was on Main Street in Mantua when he first spotted the object. He said it looked like two saucers with their rims placed together and the bottom facing out.

He said it was very brilliant and had no coloring of any type. He reported it to the Portage sheriff and first state police and reported it shortly after that.

Buchert went home and awakened his wife to show her the object.

He said two of the some pictures of the object. He told the TIMES that only one of the three exposures turned out.

He planned not to release the picture to anyone until he had conferred with government officials.

An enlargement of the photograph intelligibly shows the object which Buchert said was the moon and a dark shaped object surrounding a ring of light to the right in the moon.

THE ONLY noise Spaur heard was a slight hum from the object was when it was first sighted. He said he heard a very low, humming noise similar to an electrical transmission.

His main thought throughout the chase was to remain calm and steady so he could see everything he could to verify the sighting and get a description of it.

He said this included the fact that the object was so close as to have seen it in both darkness and daylight.

Spaur said the object didn't make any attempt to get away. He said it followed the car "almost as if it knew it."

Deeply Robert Wilson, the radio operator at Ravenna, said the object was reported by at least six or seven departments in Ohio.

Houston had his headquarters telephone Pennsylvania State Police at Chippewa Barracks and state police cars were in Route 51 at the time.

He said that they lost sight of the object near the entrance to Bradys Run Park where trucks stopped at the traffic light forced them to stop.

They continued through Fallston, and just after passing the P&LE Railroad underpass in Bridgewater. They again spotted the object near the bridge in Rochester. At Rochester it was directly ahead of them again, and they waited for them to get between the bridges at Rochester and back onto the open boulevard before it continued.

Spaur said the object definitely was controlled, because it could change speed, and gain or lose altitude. When it wants to stop, it would just play around, he said. When he thought they had lost it for good, it would reappear as if it had waited for them to catch up again, Spaur said.

When shown the picture taken last August, Brighton Township, last August, Spaur told the TIMES it looked very much like the object he had seen.

William Weltzell, chairman of the Pittsburgh subcommittee for the National Investigations Committee, who investigated the Lucci sight, was in Ravenna Sunday and today to investigate this latest sighting.

Spaur, personnel were expected in Ravenna today to investigate the sighting and to look at Buchert's photograph.

Their conclusion that the object sighted was the planet Venus is so ridiculous that the United States Air Force has suffered a great loss of prestige in this community.

However, what bothers me most, as a private citizen and as a former U.S. Congressman, is that representatives of the United States Air Force charged with the responsibility of investigating UFO reports, have never personally come to this county to interview the three eye witnesses to this happening. And this investigation is not far away and I am sure there are personnel available to conduct a thorough investigation.

I personally know the three officers involved. They are men of integrity and I feel it is grossly unfair to them for the Air Force to reach any conclusion in this matter until it has conducted a real and complete investigation.

As the Congressman from this District I sincerely urge you to insist that the Air Force immediately send Investigators to Portage County to make such an on the spot investigation and to re-evaluate it's findings after such a visit.

Sincerely yours,

Rumor and Rhubarb
Here 'n There

Maybe there's a UFO base in Conway, West Aliquippa residents among others, saw debris (unidentified flying object) Monday night and among persons watching it were Air Quota Policemen John Wytaz and William Byrd, who were in the area at 9:30 p.m.

Wytaz doesn't buy the theory that it was a private airplane with an illuminated advertising message under its wing as reported Tuesday. He described it as a reddish-orange, square-like object with white lights on its circumference.

He looked at it through binoculars, saw no sign of advertising on it and said that, unlike an airplane, it was noiseless.

Like a UFO that Ohio police cruisers talked to Conway Sunday, the local policemen watched the "square" disappear in the direction of Conway.

He's Sure Negative's Positive
Chief Saw the Saucer
And Got the Picture
By ROBERT FROMKE
Post-Gazette Staff Writer

While hundreds of Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio residents gawked at this area's first flying saucer early Sunday morning, Police Chief Gerald Buchert of Mantua, Ohio, did something beautifully simple.

He took a picture.

When the picture was developed, there it was, "Well," said Mrs. Buchert to the Post-Gazette yesterday.

"It looked like a ... saucer," One feels a little silly saying things like that in the day-time, with the sun shining. But it was different at 5 a.m. Sunday when Chief Buchert dragged her out of bed and they watched the bright object maneuver its way across the sky.

Portage County Ohio sheriff's deputies W. L. Neff and Dale Spaur, in separate cars, were chasing the object into Pennsylvania at speeds up to 100 miles an hour.

At East Palestine, Ohio, Patrolman Wayne Huston took one of the chase, and the three police cars sped all the way to Conway, Beaver County, where the "object" disappeared.

One picture is said to be (Continue on Page 13, Column 1)

Saw Saucer,
Got a Shot
(Continued from Page 1)

worth 10 thousand words, and anyone who tries to put together a rational description of the saucer from the eyewitness reports had better believe it.

• Patrolman Huston: "It looked like a partially melted ice-cream cone -- a wedge-shaped affair with the pointy part down ... What looked like an antenna was sticking out on one side of it..."

• Chief Buchert: "I looked like two table saucers put together."

• Mrs. Buchert: "It was a round, bright, white object, and when it tilted or turned it had a ring around the middle of it."

• Sheriff's Deputy Spaur: "I looked like the head of a flashlight, about 40 feet wide and 18 feet high."

• Sheriff's Deputy Neff: "It was a very bright, cone-shaped object, some 35 to 45 feet across the top and about 24 feet high."

Chief Buchert was the man with the picture, but he had some initial trouble with the Air Force. He called Project Bluebook, the Air Force UFO headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, a spokesman told him he could release the picture if he wished, but they'd rather he didn't.

Taking the hint, Chief Buchert kept it to himself over Sunday.

Yesterday morning an Air Force spokesman from Washington called Buchert and told him to go ahead and release the picture if he hadn't already done so.

The saucer's strange behavior had apparently frightened one of the pursuers, Deputy Spaur. "We were close, closer than I ever want to be again," he said.

Spaur said the lines of the object were very distinct. "Somebody had control over it," he said. "It was just floating around. It can't move, never."

Near Rochester, Beaver County, the pursuing police officers "got tangled up," according to Spaur's account. "So when I came out from the bridge it came from -- I waited for us just as I thought I knew these cars were following me."

"I know nobody's going to believe it," Spaur said. "Scientifically, but it's true."

So there you have it, reports from: the Federal Aviation Agency's radar screens, but a definite report on Buchert's picture. No planes in the area at the time, but -- rumor has it -- a satellite high above at the right time and place. Fate in tomorrow, same bat-channel.

AIR FORCE SAYS IT WAS PLANET VENUS

Explanation Of UFO Rejected

Beaver Co. Times 25 Apr 66

The Air Force's explanation of the sighting of an unidentified flying object April 17 in Ohio and Beaver County isn't being accepted by one of the men who saw the UFO, Sheriff's Deputy Dale Spahr of Portage County, Ohio.

In a report issued over the weekend, the Air Force said:

"The probable cause of the sighting by Sheriff Dale F. Spahr, of Ravenna, Ohio, was the passage of a satellite, as it approached the southeast portion of the sky. It disappeared, and Sheriff Spahr focused his eyes on the planet Venus."

SPAHR isn't buying that explanation. He said Saturday "I don't know how much of an investigation they made, but evidently it wasn't a very lengthy one and it didn't involve me."

He said he had two brief phone conversations with Maj. Hector Quintanilla, head of "Project Blue Book" the Air Force official UFO investigation project. They lasted about two and a half minutes, he said.

"First of all, I don't think there is a satellite that can go this low and I don't think we have one in the large or that I can stop or go or maneuver anytime. I'm definitely sure I wasn't chasing Venus tracking wildly over the countryside."

Spahr and his partner William Weitzel, Pittsburgh, W. U. "Darnay" Staff investigator for National Investigations Phenomena Committee on Aerial Phenomena, isn't accepting the Air Force explanation. He said that the object, which Spahr described as about 15 to 16 feet long, was very bright, almost glow. He said that the chase started after the object began flying directly over their heads in about 150 feet in the air south of Ravenna.

They were joined in the chase by East Palestine by Patrolman Wayne Huston, who also reported seeing the object. Their chase ended at Conway, where Patrolman Frank Panzanella along Route 66. The four said they watched the object for about 20 minutes in Conway.

Spahr said he wouldn't have risked his life, his partner's or any innocent person's if he hadn't thought it was important.

"I don't agree that it's a satellite and I also don't agree that it's Venus. I know what I saw and I believe it and I'll never change my mind."

Venus was rising in the southeast and was brighter than any star in the sky. It is believed that Sheriff Spahr saw the planet Venus."

The article continues with additional text on the right side that is partially illegible, discussing further details about the UFO investigation and William Weitzel's involvement.

The Air Force's explanation of the sighting of an unidentified flying object April 17 in Ohio and Beaver County isn't being accepted by one of the men who saw the UFO, Sheriff's Deputy Dale Spaur of Portage County, Ohio.

In a report issued over the weekend, the Air Force said:

"The probable cause of the sighting by Sheriff Dale F. Spaur, of Ravenna, Ohio, was the passage of a satellite, as it approached the southeast portion of the sky, to disappear, and Sheriff Spaur focused his eyes on the planet Venus."

SPAUR isn't buying that explanation. In the said Saturday "I don't know how much of an investigation they made, but certainly I wasn't a very lengthy one and it didn't involve me."

He said he had two brief phone conversations with Hector Quintanilla, head of "Project Blue Book", the Air Force official UFO investigation project. They lasted about two and a half minutes, he said.

"First of all, I don't think there is a satellite that can go this low or that it can stop or go or maneuver anyway. I'm definitely sure I wasn't chasing Venus watching over the countryside."

Spaur and his partner William Weitzel, Pittsburgh, W. L. "Barney" Neff chased the object described as about 50 to 60 feet across with a very bright, white light after the object had been in sight for about 150 feet in the air south of Ravenna, Ohio, for the past week collecting information.

They were joined in the chase at East Palestine by Patrolman Wayne Huston, who also reported seeing the object. Their chase ended at Conway, where they found Patrolman Frank Panazzola along Route 66. The four said they watched the object for about 20 minutes in Conway.

Spaur said he wouldn't have risked his life, his partner's or any innocent person's if he hadn't thought it was important.

"I don't agree that it's a satellite and I also don't agree that it's Venus. I know what I saw and I believe it and I'll never change my mind."

William Weitzel, Pittsburgh, investigations for National Investigations Command on Aerial Phenomena, isn't accepting the Air Force explanation either.

Weitzel has been in Beaver County to continue his investigation of the sighting by James Lucci, Brighton Town district.

He spent a considerable amount of time in the county investigating the sighting and has sent a summary of his investigation to Ohio and several other states.

Weitzel said, he sent to Cong. Stanton a file of the Air Force's information to have adequately investigated the sighting. He has called the Air Force's official concern for its approach "of little importance."
