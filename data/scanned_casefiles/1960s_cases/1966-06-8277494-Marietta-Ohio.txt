Living in the landing pattern of Wood County (WVAG) Airport, I am familiar with the appearance of Conventional Aircraft under all circumstances, these objects were not shiny. We only with to ID are familiar with the satellites and their pattern over our area.

In all the time we have lived out here, we cannot recall any aircraft (other than private planes) flying in the same direction as these objects.

Have also seen High Flying objects (which have the brilliance of stars) which will remain stationary for 20-30 minutes and then move off to disappear on the horizon in a very short time.

Have a very poor picture of objects taken on June 14, 1966.
