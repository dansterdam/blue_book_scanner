Exec utive Officer,
Public Information Division,
Office of Information Service,
Department of the Air Force,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Two very brilliant fireballs appeared over Pennsylvania on Nov. 27 at 6:05 p.m. and on Dec. 7 about 5:40 p.m.

Many reports, particularly on the former, have come in and I am to consult re the end and orbits of both.

If reports on either or both of these fireballs have been sent in to you, would you be kind enough to send me copies of them?

If possible, be as accurate, proper acknowledgment will be given to the Air Force for any reports you can send me.

Very truly,

[Signature area is blacked out]

November 19, 1963

This is in response to your letter of November 14, 1963, with enclosures, regarding the reported sighting of a flying object near Tiona, Pennsylvania, on November 9, 1963, which was initially reported to the Pittsburgh Filter Center.

The Foreign Technology Division advises us that they have reviewed the report and the available information concerning the sighting. They have concluded that the object observed was a little hard to evaluate as to its exact nature, but it appears to have been a possible sighting of a satellite or missile, and the witnesses will be advised as such.

As a matter of information, the Foreign Technology Division will prepare a summary report of this incident in the near future, which will be sent to you.

Sincerely,

HAROLD M. JONES
Chief, Information Division
Directorate of Information
