THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT WAS NOT OBTAINED UNTIL 13/20007 JULY 1960 BECAUSE MR KEIM WAS ON A FISHING TRIP AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING AND DID NOT RETURN HOME UNTIL 13 JULY 1960. TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITH MR KEIM OBSERVED THE TRAIL OF SMOKE, HOWEVER THE FLASH HAD OCCURRED PRIOR TO THEIR OBSERVATION. THE PREPARING OFFICER HAS NO EXPLANATION AS TO THEIDENTITY OF THE OBJECT. THE COURSE OF THE OBJECT AND TRAIL OF SMOKE WAS PARALLEL AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE HIGHWAY LEADING TO BIG DELTA. A CHECK WAS MADE WITH FAA AT FORT GREELEY TO DETERMINE IF ADDITIONAL SIGHTING HAD BEEN MADE: THERE WERE NONE REPORTED. L. NONE

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location 5 mi. NW of Big Delta, Alaska

Date 9 July 1960                   Hour (Z) 0615Z

WX Mild, scattered clouds, vis 50 mi, winds SW and S at 8 to 13 knots

Description A brilliant yellow flash size of dime left a large trail of heavy black smoke w/ varying degrees of density, estimated to be several miles long. was first seen 40 deg elev at 125 deg, disapp 20 deg elev at 125 deg, trail was horizontally earth and parallel with the road, was viewed for about 5 to 10 seconds.

Direction of Motion descending

Satellites: (AFCIN-483, Phone 69219) None reported to be reentering at this time.

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) Probably a daylight meteor

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-481)     None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc)  -------

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. Failed out-no soft reported to have crashed

Other

Evaluation of Source Reliability loss reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: If it had been an soft burning it would not have travelled so far and would not have left such a long trail of smoke as that that reported by the witnesses. There were no soft crash reports. The object is typical of a large meteor that is seen during daylight, burning up and leaving a trail of smoke.
