Dear [redacted]

Reference your recent unidentified observation. Detailed investigation revealed the planet Venus was probably responsible for most of the sightings. Venus, with a stellar magnitude of -3.4 during most of March, would have been the brightest celestial body in the sky. On March 6, 1967 at 6:30 p.m., Venus would have been on an azimuth of 265 degrees at an elevation of 15 degrees.

You mentioned throughout the report that the object often appeared as a star, only brighter, also, it appeared to move at times and change colors. When stars or planets are viewed low on the horizon, the observer is looking through many more miles of the earth's atmosphere than when looking overhead toward the zenith. The earth's atmosphere actually acts as a prism which, in effect, causes the incoming rays of light to be broken down into the various colors of the spectrum. In technical terms it is called the incoming rays are refracted by the atmosphere. The closer the stars are to the horizon, the more they scintillate, simply, as mentioned above, because we are then looking through a thicker layer of air. This, in effect, causes an astronomical body to appear to move in the sky.

From the information submitted, it does appear that Venus was responsible for the majority of the sightings. The Air Force has received several reports during the months of March and April describing observations similar to yours.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DRAFT

Dear Mr[redacted]

President Johnson has asked that I reply to your letter concerning the unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which are being sighted in your area.

Within the Department of Defense the Air Force has the responsibility of investigating UFOs reported to it and determining whether or not these objects constitute a threat to our national security. This program is carried out under the designation Project Blue Book. The enclosed brochure explains our program since its inception in 1947.

Blue Book personnel at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base inform me they have not received any UFO reports from your area. However, March 8-10, they received many from Gladesbury, Moline, and Monmouth.

These sightings were determined to be hot air balloons.

I have enclosed an ETD Form 164 which is used in officially reporting a sighting to the Air Force. If you will complete this form and return it in the attached envelope, we will attempt to evaluate the sightings in your area. We are not testing "soundless planes from outer space."

I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Attachments                                                  Sincerely,

Kilbourne's U.F.O. ??
By Ted Comolly
The subject of unidentified flying object has long puzzled but ???? was requested to try to photograph one of these U.F.O.'s this week which has been appearing around the Kilbourne area, particularly on the evening of March 14th.

I had at first passed this incident off as nothing but possibly large lights reflecting off the Illinois River and then onto the clouds, which had been many times while hiking along the river.

I did go to Kilbourne last night and made a few exposures of an object that seemed to hover in the sky as it brightly changed colors from a bright white glow at the photo and come to your own conclusions or better yet, drive over to the intersection of Rt. 97 and the Bath blacklog and take a look for yourself. If you know, it is a U.F.O., a weather balloon, or what have you, let me know. Eight people and myself saw the same thing when I made these pictures and none of us could come up with an answer as to what it might be.

This photo was magnified approximately 200 times the size it was viewed.

Handwritten note at top right of page (partially illegible): 15 miles after hospitalize... watched this being changed...

On the night of March 6, 1967 at approximately 7:45, our dog, who is getting rather hard of hearing, started barking, we looked out, before coming so many a very strange, very bright subject in the sky to the west of us, hanging just a little above tree top height, might over his neighbor's house, approximately 3/4 mile west of us.

It kept changing colors, red, blue and white, very bright, with the sky showing around the bottom. For some minutes, after about 45 minutes it would turn off its lights completely.

After about 45 minutes it moved up to the behind the trees, still being until it disappeared.

We (I, Remington, my husband and two neighbors) saw it again on March 9, this time it was constantly lighting, but it looked just the same as before, but with a more brilliant blue.
