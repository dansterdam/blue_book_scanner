11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a bright white light that at first appeared to be stationary butthen moved off toward the southern sky. The light was compared to a white light on a pole about one mile away. It was also brighter than the bright star in the western sky in the early evenings (Venus).
In view of the fact that a KC-135 aircraft departed Blytheville AFB and was in the area, that the KC-135 aircraft has a record of causing this type of UFO report, and that the aircraft departed to the south would indicate that the witness could have seen this aircraft and reported it to be a UFO.

WHEN TURNED ON AND APPEAR TO BE A ROUND BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT WHEN

DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF MILE AT BLYTHEVILLE AFB DURING

PAGE 4 RUWTBP2597 UNCLAS
IS TURNED ON BUT RATHER AS THE CREW DESIRES, EVEN DURING TAKE-OFF.

THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THAT A KC-135 HAS BEEN SUSPECTED OF BEING
THE CAUSE OF A UFO SIGHTING. THE B-52G IS NOT SO EQUIPPED AND HAS
NOT BEEN SUSPECTED OF CAUSING A REPORT OF THIS TYPE. IN VIEW OF
THE FACT THAT A KC-135 WAS IN THE OSCEOLA AREA AT APPROXIMATELY
THE TIME OF SIGHTING, THAT THE KC-135 HAS A RECORD OF CAUSING THIS
TYPE REPORT, THAT THE INSTRUMENT DEPARTURES TO THE SOUTH ALWAYS
PLACES JET AIRCRAFT IN THE VICINITY OF OSCEOLA WITHIN APPROXIMATELY
THREE MINUTES, THE MOST LOGICAL CONCLUSION AS TO THE CAUSE OF THIS
SIGHTING IS THAT THE OBSERVER SAW THE KC-135 DURING DEPARTURE
FROM BLYTHEVILLE AFB. PARA 14(LIMA): NONE. A TAPE RECORDING OF
THE ORIGINAL REPORT TO 97TH BOMB WING IS AVAILABLE.
