Memo, AFCIN-4E, 6 Apr 61, Request for Evaluation of UFO Report
1st Ind (AFCIN-4612/Maj. Oliveros/jc/7/2011) 12 May 61
TO: AFCIN-4E (Maj. Friend)

1. A final evaluation cannot be made on the basis of the limited information submitted. Since no temperature data below 10,000 ft. is available, there is no evidence of a specific condition considered essential for visual or instrument detection. However, the observer states that the weather was "ceiling and visibility unlimited." It is very likely that a temperature inversion conditions existed, which may be appropriate for consideration. Lack of specific information on the behavior of the object precludes definite analysis, since the behavior is the major factor for detection of a radar beam. Since the behavior of the reported UFO is synonymous with this type of failure to track, it is difficult to determine validity of the report.

2. As is the case with all reports of this type, the possibility of equipment malfunction causing the false target cannot be ruled out completely.

Received a call at 0100, 28 Feb, from AF Command Post, Wash DC.
A NORAD Sergeant called and stated that a Bomarc Missile site in
the vicinity of Ft Meade, Maryland, had detected an unknown target on
radar. The Sergeant reported that the object was tracked by radar.
The following information was given: Velocity, 900 knots; Speed, 900 knots with stops
and starts; Altitude, 55,000 feet; Course, changing frequently. The unknown
was also detected by means of radar at the Ft Meade Missile Master Center and also tracked on radar.
The information was relayed to NORAD Command Post at Colorado Springs. Local illumination

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a document containing questions related to the observation of an unidentified flying object.

The text on the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object it covers. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
