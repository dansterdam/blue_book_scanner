Memo, AFCIN-4E, 6 Apr 61, Request for Evaluation of UFO Report
1st Ind (AFCIN-4E1a/Maj. Oliveros/3c/74201)                     12 May 61

TO:   AFCIN-4E (Maj. Friend)

1.   A firm evaluation cannot be made on the basis of the limited information
submitted. Since no temperature data below 10,000 ft. is available, there
is no evidence of any unusual atmospheric conditions at low levels. However,
considering the time of night involved, along with the fact that the reported
weather was "ceiling and visibility unlimited," it is very likely that a
low level temperature inversion existed due to nocturnal surface cooling.
Erratic false targets are not too uncommon when appropriate temperature
inversion conditions exist for deflecting a radar beam. Since the behavior
of the reported UFO is symptomatic of this type of false target, it is
therefore evaluated as such.

2.   As is the case with all reports of this type, the possibility of equipment
malfunction accounting for the false target cannot be ruled out completely.

28 Feb 61

The following, extracted from 1/Lt Furnell's Report dated 27 Feb 61,
is quoted for your information:

Received a call at 0100, 28 Feb, from AF Command Post, Wash DC,
A Maj Sizemore reported that he had received an interesting
report on a UFO. The UFO was observed by a Sergeant at Fort
Meade Missile Master Center and also tracked on radar. The
following information was given: Place CJQ4515. Time:
28/0430z. Description: Cluster of 3 objects, total illumination
as large as a star. Heading: 90° Speed: 900 knots with stops
and starts. Altitude between 7 and 9 thousand feet. The important part: of this report seems to be that the objects were
tracked by means of radar. Received no message on subject.
