Here is the text from the document:

SUBJECT: SIGHTING, BY CAPTAIN WILLIAM S. BARNETT, STAFF INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, HEADQUARTERS, NEW YORK AIR DEFENSE SECTOR, MCGUIRE AFB, N.J. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS INDICATED AS FOLLOWS: THE INITIAL REPORT

PAGE THREE RUEJER 29
WAS CALLED IN TO THE OFFICER OF THE DAY AT SUFFOLK COUNTY AFB, NEW YORK WHO RELAYED THE CALL TO THE SENIOR DIRECTOR AT HQ NEW YORK AIR DEFENSE SECTOR. AT THE SAME TIME OF THE INITIAL SIGHTING THIS SECTOR WAS EXPERIENCING SOME JAMMING AT VARIOUS OF OUR RADAR SITES. SCRAMBLE ACTION WAS TAKEN AND TWO F-121S AIRCRAFT WERE SENT TO THE AREA OF THE REPORTED SIGHTING. THEY COULD NOT FIND ANY TARGET BUT REPORTED SEEING "VERY PRETTY AURORA BOREALIS." ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A WEATHER BALLOON WAS LAUNCHED FROM IDLEWILD AIRPORT AT 23037.

AREA ABOUT THE TIME PO THE SIGHTING. HOWEVER, THE INTERCEPTOR CREWS DID NOT SEE ANY BALLOON. IT IS FELT THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED SIGHTING WAS THAT THE OBSERVER SAW EITHER THE AURORA BOREALIS OR A WEATHER BALLOON WHICH DRIFTED AWAY BEFORE THE INTERCEPTORS COULD GET TO THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING. THE COMBINATION OF THE INITIAL SIGHTING, THE INTERCEPTOR CREWS SEEING THE AURORA BOREALIS AND THIS SECTOR EXPERIENCING JAMMING AT RADAR SITES ALL AT THE SAME TIME LEADS THIS OFFICER TO BELIEVE THAT THE AURORA BOREALIS WAS THE CAUSE OF THIS REPORT. L. NONE.
