This image appears to be a graph or chart with a grid layout. The vertical axis on the left side has numerical markings from 0 to 400, and the horizontal axis seems to have similar markings. The page has two hole punches on the left side, indicating it is likely part of a bound document. The image is in black and white and appears to be a scanned document with some edge darkening and slight image degradation typical of older photocopied or scanned materials.


- page 11 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

"and heights of objects at multiples
of hundreds without supporting data;
such as size of object, actual flight
path, etc. If object was satellite,
would have a retrograde orbit."

The rest of the text on the page is either too blurry or cut off to be legible.


- page 12 -

The image appears to be a large grid or chart document, with most of the text being too faint or blurry to read clearly. The right side of the document contains some form fields or tables, but the text is not legible.

Report on Unidentified Flying Object

1. Description of the object:
   a. Shape - Elliptical with a radiant appearance.
   b. Size - Softball (cover up with my thumb).
   c. Color - Similar to a star and very radiant.
   d. Number - 1
   e. Formation - 1
   f. Discernible feature: Appeared a solid object, stable in flight and seemed to be pulling toward the north.
   g. Tail or Trail - None, but had a radiant reflection effect.
   h. Unusual Features - It seemed to be traveling in a fixed course and pulling toward a northerly angle.

2. Description of Course of Object:
   When I (MSgt [redacted]) first noticed the UFO at 0545 hours, 21 December 1961, Capehart Housing area, Tyndall AFB, Florida, the object seemed to be traveling from Northwest (315 degree) to Northeast (25 degree). I observed the object for five minutes, to assure myself that it was not an aircraft.

   I called the Base Weather Station at 0555 hours and talked with Lt William Poe. I asked him to have the tower observer look in the Northeast for an UFO.

   I called back to Lt. William Poe and he said A2C [redacted] had seen a bright object in the Northeast and it could have been a bright star.

   When I reported to work at 0730 hours I called MSgt Virgil E. Miracle (Office of the Director of Operations) and found that he was off for the day. I went over to the Office of Information and reported the UFO to Mr. Hank Basham.


- page 45 -

This image appears to be a graph or chart with a grid pattern. The vertical axis on the left side has numerical markings from 0 to 350, with increments of 25. The entire page is a grid of white lines on a black and white background, with varying shades of gray throughout the grid. There are two hole punches visible on the left side of the document, suggesting it was part of a bound report or file. The graph lines and markings are somewhat faint and blurry, making precise reading difficult.


- page 46 -

ADIABATIC CHART

[The image contains a large grid chart with numerous rows and columns, with some text on the right side that is partially illegible due to image quality. The chart appears to be a technical reference document with numerical scales and grid lines. At the bottom right, there is a partial date or reference number "30/2/N... 852 A.M."]

Most of the text on the right side of the chart is too blurry to read with complete certainty. The title "ADIABATIC CHART" is clearly visible at the top right of the document.


- page 47 -

The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with vertical and horizontal lines. The left side of the page has numerical markings ranging from 0 to 100, with some numbers in brackets. The grid is faded and appears to be a black and white scanned document. The quality of the scan is somewhat grainy and dark, making some details difficult to discern. There are three hole punches visible on the left side of the page, suggesting this is a page from a binder or report.


- page 48 -

The image appears to be a technical document with a large grid or chart taking up most of the page. The right side of the page contains several smaller boxes with text, but much of the text is too faint or blurry to read clearly. The document seems to be a data sheet or report with various numerical and graphical elements. The overall image is in black and white and appears to be an old, scanned document with some degradation in image quality.


- page 49 -

I did some research and checked all of the places where I thought they might have seen the UFO.

I told Mr. Hank Basham I would check further to see if the UFO was Echo. I figured out if the UFO was Echo it should return on or about 1715 hours, 21 December and 0510 hours, 22 December 1961. After my final evaluation of the UFO, I came to the conclusion, the UFO sighted was a new space vehicle of which I was unaware.

b. Angle or elevation and azimuth of the object: See attached sketch. Object seemed to be traveling on an azimuth of 315 degrees.

c. Angle and azimuth of object seemed to disappear - angle 35 degrees and azimuth 25 degrees.

d. Description of flight path and maneuvers of object: It was traveling as if it were on a fixed orbit and had a radiant effect around it. The height of the object was approximately 800 miles up and was traveling at a speed of approximately 18,000 miles per hour (basing this with my experience in observing echo and other space vehicles).

e. Manner in which object disappeared: Fading out; still with the radiant lighting effect.

f. Length of time object was visible: I observed it for 15 minutes and figured it first appeared at 0540 hours.

3. Method used in observation:

a. Ground - Visual
b. Optical aid - None
c. Aircraft used - None

4. Time and Date of Sighting:

a. Time: 0545 hours, date 21 December 1961.
b. Light condition - Clear, cold, damp at daybreak and the moon was setting.

5. Location of Observer: See attached sketch. Capehart Housing, Tyndall AFB, Florida

6. Identifying information on observer:
a. Military - MSgt, Hq 73 Air Division, duty title, ANCO.

7. Weather and Wind: According to Base Weather Station, the weather was clear and visibility was 10 miles. A full moon was visible until 0600 hours.

8. Additional Remarks: From years of experience in observing UFO's, I was puzzled at the radiant effect of the object. Maybe this was due to the sun rising and the moon setting, for a radiant effect on the UFO. I've also made an evaluation and comparison of previous UFO's seen and I have come to the conclusion this UFO sighted was a new space vehicle.

Another thing that made me look to the sky that morning was that my TV set was acting up, with plenty of interference. In the past, I have discovered two UFO's by going outside when my TV set acted up because of outside interference. They were the two UFO reports submitted 1835 hours, 19 September 1960 and 1945 hours, 9 May 1961. This might be a coincidence but I have also observed that when a thunderstorm is moving toward Tyndall AFB, you can tell. Also I've observed freak TV signals from Cuba, Texas, Louisiana, etc., which I do believe are caused by sun spots or unknown other interference. When this occurs, I always check the sky, for UFO's.

This report was prepared by MSgt. The information contained herein is true to the best of his knowledge. He has studied this UFO and believes it might be a new space vehicle, basing this on his past experience in tracking other UFO's and Echo.
