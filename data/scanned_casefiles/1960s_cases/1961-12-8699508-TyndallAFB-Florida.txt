The image appears to be a grid-like pattern, which could potentially be a photograph or image captured as part of a UFO investigation. However, as the image does not contain any human faces, I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals. Instead, I will focus on describing the contents of the image as objectively as possible.

The image consists of a grid-like pattern, with dark and light rectangular elements arranged in a grid formation. The grid appears to be composed of horizontal and vertical lines, creating a series of rectangular cells. The overall pattern is quite intricate and visually striking, though the precise nature or purpose of the image is not immediately clear from the context provided.

Report on Unidentified Flying Object
1. Description of the object:
a. Shape - Elliptical with a radiant appearance.
b. Size - Softball (cover up with my thumb).
c. Color - Similar to a star and very radiant.
d. Number - 1
e. Formation - 1
f. Discernible feature: Appeared as a solid object, stable flight; and seemed to be pulling toward the north.
g. Tail or Trail - None, but had a radiant reflection effect.
h. Unusual Features - It seemed to be traveling in a straight and pulling toward a northerly angle.
2. Description of Course of Object:
a. When I (MSgt _____) first noticed the UFO at 0545 hours, 21 December 1961, Capehart Housing area, Tyndall AFB, Florida, the object seemed to be traveling from Northwest (315 degrees) to Northeast (25 degrees). I observed the object for five minutes, to assure myself that it was not an aircraft.
I called the Base Weather Station at 0555 hours and with Lt William Poe, I asked him to have the tower observe the UFO.
I called back to Lt. William Poe and he said A2C _____ had seen a bright object in the Northeast and it could have been a bright star.
When I reported to work at 0730 hours I called MSgt Miracle (Office of the Director of Operations) and found that the UFO was still under observation for the day. I went over to the Office of Information and discussed the UFO to Mr. Hank Bassham.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page of text from a UFO report document.

I did some research and checked all of the places where I thought they might have seen the UFO.

I told Mr. Hank Basham I would check further to see if the object was Echo. I figured out if the UFO was Echo it should return or about 17.5 hours. 21 December and 0510 hours, 22 December. After my final evaluation of the UFO, I came to the conclusion that the UFO sighted was not Echo, which I was unsure of.

b. Angle or elevation and azimuth of the object: See attached sketch. Object seemed to be traveling on an azimuth of 315 degrees.

c. Angle and azimuth of object seemed to disappear - any degrees and azimuth 25 degrees.

d. Description of flight path and maneuvers of object: It traveling as if it were on a fixed orbit and had a radiant surface around it. The height of the object was approximately 800 m and was traveling at a speed of approximately 18,000 miles per hour (basing this with my experience in observing echo and other satellites).

e. Manner in which object disappeared: Fading out; still the radiant lighting effect.

f. Length of time object was visible: I observed it for 15 and figured it first appeared at 0540 hours.

3. Method used in observation:
a. Ground - Visual
b. Optical aid - None
c. Aircraft used - None

4. Time and Date of Sighting:
a. Time: 0545 hours, date 21 December 1961.
b. Light condition - Clear, cold, damp at daybreak and the object was sighting.

Text extracted from the document:

5. Location of Observer: See attached sketch. Gapehcart Hotel, Tyndall AFB, Florida

6. Identifying information on observer: Military - MSgt, HQ 73 Air Division, duty title, NCO.

7. Weather and Wind: According to Base Weather Station, the weather was clear and visibility was 10 miles. A full moon was visible until 0600 hours.

8. Additional Remarks: From years of experience in observing UFO's, I have discovered the present effect of the object, this was due to the sun rising and the moon setting, for a radar effect on the UFO. I have also made an evaluation and comparison of previous UFO's seen and I have come to the conclusion that it is a new space vehicle.

Another thing that made me look to the sky that morning was that my TV set was acting up, with plenty of interference. I have discovered two UFOS coming outside when my TV set acts up because of outside interference. They were about two to three times the size of an automobile and lasted only about 1 to 1.5 seconds. On both occasions, 1960 and 1945, when a thunderstorm is moving toward Tyndall AFB, you can tell, the observed craft TV signals drop out. Texas, Louisiana, I do believe are caused by sun spots or unknown other interference. When this occurs, I always check the sky, for UFO's.

This report was prepared by MSgt, information contained herein is true to the best of his knowledge. Its has studied this UFO and believes it might be a new space vehicle, basing this on his past experience in tracking other and Echo.
