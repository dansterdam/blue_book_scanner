REPORT FORM FOR METEOR OBSERVATION

Information marked • is vital

* Place of observation: Deck of the [redacted], West mid way
Between Plum Gut and Shelter Island, L.I. (Long Island Sound)

* Date:
June 25, 1960

Time: 9 PM
(Give Time Standard and whether am. or pm)

* Accuracy of time given above:
(e.g. say "exact", or "±1 minute", or "±5 minutes", etc.)
+ or - 5 minutes

* Brightness (compared to stars, planets, moon or other useful standard source such as a street light at a certain distance):
1st Magnitude Star

Direction in which object was first seen:
(To N, or SE, or NW, etc.)
From Arising, Due South off Port Beam

* Length or time object was seen:
6 - 8 mins. approx.

* Apparent direction in which object travelled:
(N-S, SE-NW, W-N, etc.)
S - To NE returning to S

Did it change direction?
Yes, from a great distance it appeared to make a "hairpin" turn, returning same course approx. and with no apparent slackening in speed.

General impression of angular speed:
(degrees/sec. across sky)
45 angle height, Speed varies (unable to estimate exactly)

Size and shape (if any):
(If just like a star, say "star-like")
Star. Like

Color
White

Did it explode, disintegrate, or suddenly vanish?
No

* Any tail or trail?
No

Did any sound accompany the object?
No

If sound followed later, give time interval:
-

Was it examined with binoculars or telescopes or photographed?
No

*Give position of trajectory for at least two points with regard
to stars if possible:
Unable to do so.

Any other remarks: Saw by 3 adults and 3 children. We assumed
it must have been a plane similar to the U.S. flying at such
great heights it was reflecting sunlight now though the earth was
in darkness. After reading newspaper reports of similar sighting how-
ever, we thought perhaps it should be reported. Now at this late date.
Before it turned, we thought it a satellite. After it turned, we could see it was something.
