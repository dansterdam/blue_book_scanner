10. CONCLUSION
Aircraft

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched two objects moving in different patterns in the northern sky. As the one object traversed its path it would become extremely dim. It also had this characteristic when making a turn. At these times the object could only be seen with the binoculars. At one time, as the observers were following object #1, object #2 passed into the field of view of the binoculars, so that they were both visible at the same moment.

The description is consistent with that of aircraft observation. Although there are no refueling tracks in the area, it appears that some aircraft were observed on some training mission. There is no evidence to indicate that other than aircraft were observed.

8. WITH REF. TO QUESTION 16:

THE UFOO OBJECT WENT INTO CLOUDS ON THE
HORIZON WHICH HAD COME IN BETWEEN 9:00 - 11:00.
THE OBJECT WAS SEEN MOVING IN THE CLOUDS
AND THEN CAME OUT AGAIN AND THEN VANISHED.

9. THE OBJECTS UNDERWENT A SERIES OF VIOLENT FLASHES
AT THE TURN POINTS. THE OBJECTS WENT DIM BEFORE TURNING,
THEN BEGAN FLASHING AS THEY TURNED. WHILE BOTH OBJECTS
WERE VISIBLE AT THE SAME TIME THEY EXECUTED SIMULTANEOUS
FLASHING WHILE PASSING BY EACH OTHER. THE COLOR WHEN IT
FLASHED WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHEN GOING ALONG ITS REGULAR PATH.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   NOV 17   OCT   1966
                                             Day     Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

1. IN MAKING THE INITIAL REPORT AN ERROR WAS MADE IN STATING THE FIELD OF VIEW OF THE BINOCULARS, I SAID IT WAS 9Â°0 WHICH I THOUGHT AT THE SEPARATION OF TWO STARS IN THE SKY WHICH WERE FAMILIAR TO ME. IN LOOKING UP THE SEPARATION IT WAS 5Â° WHICH AGREES WITH THE LATER DISCOVERED FIELD MARKED ON THE BINOCULARS. (P.4)

2. WE WENT OUT AGAIN AT 11:00 PM THE SAME NIGHT TO TAKE READINGS ON A COMPASS AND SAW ANOTHER (THE SAME?) OBJECT AGAIN. IT MADE ONE EYE BACK AND FORTH IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE OBJECTS SIGHTED AT 7:30 PM AND THEN VANISHED.

3. WHILE WATCHING THE OBJECTS A PLANE PASSED IN A DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO THE OBJECTS LINE OF FLIGHT. DURING THE COURSE OF OBSERVATION SEVERAL (2-3) PLANES PASSED. AFTER THE OBJECTS WENT AWAY FOR SOME A SATELLITE PASSED OVERHEAD IN AN APPROXIMATE EAST-WEST DIRECTION.

4. WITH REF TO QUESTION 20: IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE SPEED AND DISTANCE WITH HIS BRIEF EXPERIENCE. THE WIFE ONLY DEPENDED ON HIS REPORTING. WHEN I WAS TOLD THE FRIEND'S WIFE SIGHTED THE OBJECT ABOUT 11:30, THE SAME TIME WE SAW THE OBJECT WHICH ONLY MADE ONE PASS, THE THEY ACROSS FIELD OF VIEW WAS TAKEN AT THE 7:30 SIGHTING AT THE AMOS SIGHTING WHICH PROBABLY MAKES THE VALUES WRONG. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS IS ALL I HAD TO GO BY I ACQUIRE SUCH ADDITIONAL.

5. I WILL ENCLOSE A SKETCH DRAWN BY THE FRIEND, AT THE TIME SHE WAS LOCATED AT MILFIELD, OHIO.

6. THE OBJECTS DEFINITELY NOT: 1) STAR 2) PLANET 3) SATELLITE 4) METEOR 5) AIRCRAFT

7. I DO NOT LEAVE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS A PLANE BUT WOULD SAY THAT IT IS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE. (HELICOPTER: DITTO)
