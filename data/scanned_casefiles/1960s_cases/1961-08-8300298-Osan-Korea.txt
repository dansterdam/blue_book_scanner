OBSERVATION: POSSIBILITY OF OBJECT BEING A JET AIRCRAFT OR HELICOPTER CASE CLOSED: AS MENTIONED THERE WAS NO CONSTDDFLIGHT LANDIWARD BUT APPEARED IRREGULAR IN BOTH SPEED AND DIRECTION. THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT CHANGED FROM WHITE TO REDDISH COLOR. AT ONE POINT OBJECT STOPPED, WAS VERY BRILLIANT IN COLOR AND AT GREAT BRILLIANCE AFTER STAYING BASICALLY STATIONARY AND CONSTANT IN COLOR WHITISH APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 3 MINUTES, THE OBJECT BEGAN TO RAISE IN VERTICAL OISTICAL LIGHT NOW CHANGING COLOR. AS THE OBJECT WAS RISING FIGHTER CAME OVER THE AREA APPROACHING THE BASE AT APPROXIMATELY 3000 FEET OR LESS. THE OBJECT THEN BEGAN FORWARD MOVEMENT AND CHANGED DIRECTION 90 DEGREES. IT IS LIGHT AT THIS POINT WAS BRILLIANT AND HAD BECOME SMALL AS THE STARS. THE SPEED AT THIS POINT WAS GREATER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. (5) OBJECT DISAPPEARED WILE STATIONARY AND SEEMED TO BE CLIMBING AND FADING RAPIDLY.

THEIR DISCUSSION, THEIR INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES AND TRAINING SHOULD
QUALIFY THEM AS COMPETENT OBSERVERS. THERE IS NO OTHER VISUAL OR ELECTRONIC CORROBORATING EVIDENCE OF THIS OBJECT. AIR FORCE WEATHER
OBSERVERS INDICATED THAT NO METEOROLOGICAL ACTIVITY DURING THE PERIOD WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE SIGHTING, ALTHOUGH THE CHANGING LIGHT TO REDDISH COLOR COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SMOKE AND HAZE IN THE AREA. THE CHIEF TOWER OPERATORS ON DUTY DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT.

BEEN CAUSED BY AN F-102 DOING EXTENSIVE FLYING AND MANEUVER

A STRONG POSSIBILITY EXIST THAT A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING OR THE RELEASE TIME THE WEATHER BALOON CONGRESSGATE OCCURRED, AND THIS WAS THE CAUSE. NO EXPLANATION EXISTS FOR THE REPORTED HIGH SPEED OF THE OBJECT, EXCEPT ERROR ON THE PART OF THE OBSERVERS. 2. COMMENTS: OTHER SIGHING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS REPORTED IN THIS AREA, AND THIS WAS THE ONLY OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FOUND.
