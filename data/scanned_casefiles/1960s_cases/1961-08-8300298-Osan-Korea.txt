10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round white obj size of pea. Appeared 15째 elev, 160째 az. Disappeared 75째 elev, 200째 az. Larger than stars.

11. COMMENTS
Report contains very little info. But what there is give no reason to believe that obj was anything other than a/c which was in area. Absence of unknown reported by radar units in area support this conclusion. There are many possible situations where movement of a/c could be mistaken for ground observers to be for example right angle turns; it all depends upon what plane the a/c is maneuvering in and its next relationship to observer.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Boxes are checked, but text is not legible to determine specific conclusion

OBSERVATION. POSSIBILITY OF OBJECT BEING A JET AIRCRAFT OR HELI
COPTER WAS DISCOUNTED DUE TO STEEPALTITUDE ASTHE OBJECT
CAME ACROSS THE SKY ITS FLIGHT PATH WAS NOT CONSTANTLY LUCNLPOR
WARD BUT APPEARED IRREGULAR IN BOTH SPEED AND DIRECTION. THE COLOR
OF THE OBJECT CHANGED FROM WHITE TO REDDISH COLOR. AT ONE POINT THE
OBJECT STOPPED, WAS VERY BRILLIANT IN COLOR AND AT GREAT ALTITUDE.
AFTER STAYING BASICALLY STATIONARY AND CONSTANT IN COLOR (WHITE) FOR
APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 3 MINUTES, THE OBJECT BEGAN TO RAISE IN 90 DEGREE
VERTICAL FLIGHT NOW CHANGING COLOR. AS THE OBJECT WAS RISING A JET
FIGHTER CAME OVER THE AREA APPROACHING THE BASE AT APPROXIMATELY
5000 FEET OR LESS. THE OBJECT THEN BEGAN FORWARD MOVEMENT AND THEN
CHANGED DIRECTION 90 DEGREES, THEN CONTINUED ITS ORIGINAL DIRECTION
TO THE EAST SOUTH EAST. ITS LIGHT AT THIS POINT WAS BRILLIANT BUT
HAD BECOME SMALL AS THE STARS. THE SPEED AT THIS POINT WAS DEFINITE
LY GREATER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. (5) OBJECT DISAPPEARED WITH
GREAT BURST OF SPEED, APPEARED TO BE CLIMBING AND FADED FROM SIGHT.

JECT BUT CONSIDEREDOT QUITE LIKELY THAT THE SIGHTING COULD HAVE
BEEN CAUSED BY AN F-102 DOING EXTENSIVE FLYING AND MANEUVERS IN THE
LOCAL AREA WITH AFTER-BURNER. THERE WERE NO MISSILE FIRINGS OR
AERIAL TESTS IN THE AREA. A STRONG POSSIBILITY EXIST THAT A DIS
CREPANCY BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING OR THE RELEASE TIME OF
THE WEATHER BALLOON COUPBGAVE OCCURRED, AND THIS WAS THE OBJECT
BEING OBSERVED. NO EXPLANATION EXISTS FOR THE REPORTED HIGH SPEED
OF THE OBJECT, EXCEPT ERROR ON THE PART OF THE OBSERVERS. 2. ON

BOTH OBSERVERS SAW AN OBJECT LARGER THAN THE STARS, MOVING TOWARD
THEM FROM EAST TO WEST FOR ABOUT 1 MINUTE. THE OBJECT THEN BEGAN
TO MAKE SHARP FAST MOVEMENTS SIDE TO SIDE AND VERTICALLY CONTINU-
ING IN GENERALLY THE SAME DIRECTION. THE OBJECT THEN STOPPED,
HOVERED FOR A FEW YECONDS, THEN BEGAN TO MOVE IN A WIDE GRADUAL TURN
AND PROCEED SOUTH. AT Z S POINT THE OBJECT WAS LARGER THAN THE

LARGEST STAR AND VERY BRIGHT, IT THEN BEGAN FADING IN BRIGHTNESS AND
EVENTUALLY DISAPPEARED. NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS OBSERVED REGARDING
ALTITUDE OR SPEED. OBSERVERS STATED THAT BECAUSE OF THE SHARP
VERTICAL AND RIGHT ANGLE MANEUVERS THE OBJEYT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
AIRCRAFT, STAR OR COMET. ROTHFUSS STATED HE HAD WATCHED WEATHER
BALLOONS ASCENDING BEFORE AND DID NOT BELIEVE THIS COULD HAVE BEEN
A BALLOON. (5) GREW DIMMER GOING UP THRU CLOUDS, THEN FADED FROM
