UFO Report

This is a report on the Marlin Marshall case of Oxford, Michigan, the sighting of 7 May 65.

I called Mr. on November 29th, slightly a bit late after the 7th of May. Mr. conducted a very intelligent conversation over the telephone, was circumspect in his answers and well above average in intelligence and articulateness. He owns a 42-acre farm but does not farm it since he is a supervisor at the Pontiac Motor Works. He is transforming his farm into a sort of wildlife refuse. I am sending him a Form 164 because he and his son are going out to re-enact the crime at their earliest opportunity. We want to get the actual trajectory of the bright light before the son called his father's attention to it. The son is twelve years old.

The son, daughter, and father were out birdwatching, coming back from a walk through their woods. Mr. had a pair of 6 x 30 binoculars in his hand and when his son said "Look at that bright light up there. It looks like a headlight." It was virtually overhead, so the father lay down on the ground and looked directly up at the light with his binoculars. It was then fairly stationary, because he said he didn't have to move his binoculars very much to keep the object in view. Yet, the son seems to indicate that the object had moved from about 40Â° zenith distance up to the zenith in a matter of less than a minute having come in from the west southwest, making a half-circle to practically west, and back to overhead.

I began by asking whether he had had any further thoughts about his sighting and he said that yes, he thought he had solved it, because not too long after the sighting he read in the Pontiac paper that they had been firing multiple-spring released satellites from Vandenburg and he thought he had witnessed such a separation of the altogether five objects that he saw.

However, this is out of the question, since neither Vandenburg nor Kennedy

launched half stage separations over the United States. Furthermore, the object was stationary, or virtually so. The son had said, only a few minutes before it was still broad daylight. The light, however, was very much brighter than a star and the boy said it did not twinkle. One finger held in an outstretched arm's length would have covered all the objects. The duration of the sighting was of the order of one minute. He had just sent his son into the houses for stronger binoculars when the object began to fade and was obscured by clouds.

It could be that the fading was caused by the gradual cloud cover. He said at one point: "It seemed almost out of reality as far as I was concerned." Later: "I thought deeply about what I was seeing, as to whether or not I was misconstruing my own perceptions." When he watched through the 6 x 30 binoculars he witnessed the actual separation of a copper-colored fainter object from the bright light. Then, later, from the bright object he saw what he thought was the ejection of three smaller objects, and then a fourth which he discerned considerably further out. Both children could see the two objects, but they could not see the smaller objects with their naked eyes. The copper-colored object had the motion of tumbling - like a maple seed when it falls to the earth - except that in this case the object didn't fall. It actually seemed to go up.

The bronze-colored object separated from the bright light very shortly after he first picked up the light in the binoculars.

We will await receipt of his Form 164.

Dear Sir:

At approximately 7:30 to 7:40 P.M. on Friday the 7th day of May, 1965:

My 12 year old son, my 9 year old daughter and I, had just scured our home after an evening walk through our woods. I had a pair of 6 X 20 binoculars in hand. My son noted that something was moving in the sky and called my attention to same. He pointed out the shiny object direct overhead and I focused my field glasses on same and made the statement that it must be a sputnik type vehicle as it looked to be at great height and no motion.

Since it was uncomfortable to look directly overhead I laid on my back in the field and studied the object. The bright shiny object became two objects, the latter of which was copper or red tinged in color. I exclaimed that it looked like a rocket had just kicked it's booster back in the field and studied the object. However there was little or no movement seen after about a minute duration.

Shortly thereafter the bright shiny object gave off three other shiny but smaller objects which were arranged thus looking from below:

[A hand-drawn sketch of 6 small circles arranged in a pattern]

A 4th shiny object was observed further out into space and further above the rest. All 6 objects started fading very gradually but the far shiny object and the red tinged object stayed in proximity to each other while the other four strung out gradually faded.

The red tinged object looked like it was tumbling or had the motion not unlike that of a maple seed when it falls to earth except that the object went away from earth.

I removed the glasses from my eyes to tell my son to go after the 6 X 50 binoculars and when I tried to find the objects again I could not. Shortly thereafter a scanty cloud cover of Cumulus clouds came from the NNW and covered the general area.

Visibility was unlimited prior to the clouds, sky was bright with only the moon visible but no stars, there was no haze and the sun was below the horizon.

The children observed the two objects with their naked eye but could not see the smaller objects. My son stated that upon first seeing the object it made 3/4ths of a circle and looked as bright as a car headlight.

Was there anything on radar unaccountable for at the time not yet? We would be very interested in hearing if this is accounted for. If it was our conjecture. If not ?

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

OXFORD, MICHIGAN
7 MAY 1965

At approximately 1930 to 1940 on 7 May 1965, three observers noticed a shiny object directly overhead. One witness started looking at the object with 6 x 30 binoculars and decided that it must be a Sputnik type vehicle since it looked to be quite high and no noise could be heard. The bright shiny object became two objects, the latter of which was copper or red tinged in color. Shortly thereafter, the bright shiny object gave off other shiny but smaller objects.

A fourth shiny object was observed further out into space and further above the rest. All six objects started fading very gradually but the large shiny object and the red tinged object stayed in proximity to each other while the other four strung out and gradually faded. The red tinged object looked like it was tumbling or had the motion not unlike that of a maple seed when it falls to earth except that the object went away from earth.

The observer removed the glasses from his eyes to tell son to go after the 8 x 50 binoculars he had. Observer tried to find the objects again but to no avail. The objects were visible for approximately one minute. After the objects disappeared a scanty cloud cover came from the NNW and covered the general area.

COMMENTS

The observer thought he had seen multiple-spring released satellites from rockets from Vandenburg; however, neither Vandenburg nor Kennedy launch half stage separations over the United States. Furthermore, the observer stated that the object was certainly, or virtually so. The description of the objects tends to rule out astronomical bodies. From the available data a definite explanation is not possible. This case is carried as unidentified by the Air Force.
