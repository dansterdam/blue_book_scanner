11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted an object that looked like a metallic baseball with a circle around it.

COMMENTS: There are several airfields near Wiggins. No one else from the area reported anything to us despite the fact this was a daylight sighting and was visible for ten minutes. The local police department was contacted but failed to respond to our request. The observer indicated that the object was two to five miles away, yet in his original letter he stated that the object ran on hydro-electric circuit. "Since it is very doubtful that a person could see a door at that distance and certainly couldn't tell how the door operates, it is felt that the sighting is psychological in nature."
