Dear Sirs:

I have seen something in the sky I cannot explain. I read in a magazine what to do if you see a U.F.O. Please do not dispose of the following report without first reading it carefully. If you do not know what it is, please pass it on to the Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, I kno, where Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr. is in charge. I hope I have done right by sending in this report, because I was instructed by Look's Flying Saucer Magazine to do so. If I did not do right, I am extremely sorry I used some of your valuable time.

Thank You.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted by black line]

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 26 FEB. 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire - a narrative explanation of your sighting:

WE WERE DRIVING ALONG IN OUR MERCURY '64 STATION WAGON, AND MY STEP SISTER AND I WERE IN THE THIRD SEAT, TALKING, WHEN I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF MOVING LIGHT IN THE SKY. WE LOOKED AT IT FOR 20 MINUTES, UNTIL WE GOT HER HOME, AND WE GOT OUT AND LOOKED AT IT. WE GOT BACK IN THE CAR, AND THEN SAW IT FLY AWAY NOT TO BE SEEN AGAIN. I KNOW IT WASN'T A REFLECTION, BECAUSE I SAW IT AFTER WE GOT OUT OF THE CAR. THE OTHER WITNESS IS ONLY SEVEN, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE SAW, ALSO, WE'RE NOT NUTS, OR TROUBLEMAKERS WHO YOU TAKE US SERIOUSLY AND TRY TO BELIEVE US. PLEASE MAKE AN INVESTIGATION, BUT I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT UNIDENTIFIED. IT WAS NOT A PLANE BECAUSE A PLANE DID PASS IT, AND THERE WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU KINDLY FOR YOUR TIME AND COOPERATION.

SIGNED, [redacted]
