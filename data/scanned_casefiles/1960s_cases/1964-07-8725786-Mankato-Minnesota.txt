Dear Sirs:

I am a student at Mankato State College in Mankato, Minnesota, and I am studying a course in astronomy. I am writing this letter to your office to obtain information on an object that I observed on the night of Saturday, July 10, at approximately 11:27 to 11:53 P.M., C.D.T. (Central Daylight Time).

This object, appeared like a satellite and passed through the following constellations, passing from south to north. The constellations that this object passed through were: first, passing above the gamma star in Cygnus and secondly through the gamma star in Cassiopeia.

I was advised to ask your advice on this site observation in that there was no knowledge obtainable as to the source of the sited object.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
Mankato, Minnesota

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 10 Jul 64, Mankato, Minnesota

27 JUL 1964

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI PD (New Caisse)
WASH D C

Reference the attached letter from _______ reporting information on an unidentified flying object observed
on 10 Jul 64. The following is a suggested reply:

"Your letter to NASA has been forwarded to the Air Force for reply. The satellite tracking data on 10 Jul 64 at approximately 1135 pm was not Echo I nor Echo II, the two satellites on which we have scheduled. It is possible that your observation was one of the other satellites of lower magnitude than first or second. It is also possible that the object was an extremely high flying aircraft."

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is in response to your letter of July 14, 1964, which was forwarded to this headquarters for reply.

The satellite-like object you observed on July 10, 1954 at 11:35 p.m. was neither Echo I nor Echo II. It is possible that your observation was one of the other satellites of lower magnitude than those in orbit. It is to also possible that the object was an extremely high-flying aircraft.

We regret that we cannot offer a more concrete explanation.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
