Multiple civilians

10. CONCLUSION
Unidentified

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One (plus 2 which separated
and flew away)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Witness, the described a very brilliant light approaching him at a height of
less than 400 feet. The light was so brilliant witness stated
that it made his hands look as though in x-ray. Object resembled
a World War I helmet, 2 objects each the size of a DC3. Smaller
objects separated from main object and took off in different
directions with extreme speed. Observer stopped car 3 times,
once originally, secondly at a local junk yard and thirdly at the
Ozark airport where object was observed through telescope.
Object reportedly confirmed by airport officials and pilot of incoming Ozark plane. Object flew almost directly over airport.
Information from local police chief to effect that sighting was
result of hot air garment bag balloon completely discounted by
witness in phone call with Hynek. Witness knows personally boys
who launched the balloon which was sent up at different time
and different date, one of the pranksters being the police
Commissioners son.

- M Yes sir, I do.

H and by the way I have a review of it coming out in the April issue of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists

M I'd be glad to read it.

H which, if you don't have a copy there in the library, I'd send you a reprint.

M Well, if you would I'd appreciate it, but I'm sure the University of Missouri would have, but I'd appreciate a copy of my own.

H All right, fine.

M Dr. Hynek, I want to ask you one thing and I don't want you take this as an affront and get mad, but I want to ask you a very personal question about this. Do you think that the Air Force could be using this situation merely to keep a secret? I mean, are you being recorded now, where you wouldn't want to say that?

H Well, no, this is all right, for me to say this. I have often wondered this myself.

M It would bother me if I were in your position.

H Well, I've often that - afterall, I'm expendable as an individual - that it is always a possibility that sth I was being used as a foil. But on the other hand, I've had no real evidence of this. If I ever come across, in 20 years it seems to me I would have come across some tangible evidence in the form of a letter that I stumbled across, or a communication that I shouldn't have heard and so forth, but I really haven't.

M You can't say that's ever happened. Well, here's what's bothered me. Have you ever checked into any Canadian incident?

H Yes.

Metz - 8

M Have you ever spent any time in the Northwest in Canada?

H Not much.

M Not much. Well, I talked to [redacted] and several fellows [redacted]
who used to be at the U. of Missouri, he is now at Berkeley (and I know
that's a bad name in colleges, but really it's quite good as far as
intellectual) and Einstein was one of his teachers at Princeton quite
a few years ago [redacted] - and I talked to him about it, and he
seems to think from he's read and things that havecome up as far as - he's
just using what you'd call scientists' intuition which scientist's don't
like to use but in cases like this it's all they've got, and he seems
to think that the Air Force is behind it in some way or another. If
not behind it, they know more about it than they're letting on like
they do, and I think that the man may have a point. The reason I think
that he does is because that there are too many ridiculous situations
given, that just couldn't be. For instance, this weather balloon thing,
with me. Now I know, sir, and of course you don't becauseyou didn't
see it, but I know positively now since they said that to me that they're
full of hot air themselves. You see.

H Yes.

M And through the basic concepts of algebraic logic or any other kind of
logic I can figure out, OK, there's something rotten in Denmark here.

H Yes, one could arrive at that. We could have a long discussion on this,
and I hope we do over a drink some time rather than over a long distance
phone, but there, one could explain this also by complete military
dumbness, and the military mind. There is that possible explanation.

However, let's go into that some time.

M I'd love to. When will you be back in this area sir?

H God only knows, but I get there every once in a while and I might ask, you may be getting to Chicago before I get down there.

M I might be; that's a good possibility.

H So, make sure that you look me up when you do. You brought up the Canadian business. What connection did that have with the . . .?

M The Canadian, yes. Well, Dr. - this friend of mine, this other Dr. - I was in Canada and he, of course, noticed that in the Northwest there are huge installations up there and no one gets in, if you know what I mean. And even the personnel - he was involved in some research up there - he asked me not to use his name by the way - and he said even the places that are fenced off,xxh in huge acres, he said the men who work there, working on the secret projects, they have to fit into certain categories. A - not being married, and things of this nature you know, and also they have to fit into certain categories of exactly what is expected of them after they get out of this project, if you know what I mean. And I just wonder if that isn't what we're really seeing?

H Well, this is something that I know nothing about . . .

M Well, it worries me. It not only worries me, I know you're a scientist and I appreciate that, and xnthxr I've read and reread many of your articles and it worries me from just an humanitarian point of view - I would hate to see a man of your stature used as a foil like that, and it could be done, knowing the military.

H Yes, it certainly could be done, and, however, I think now, with the National Academy of Sciences having given its fine OK to the Condon

92


- page 4 -

Report 1 wouldn't be the only one being used as a foil, but Condon and the entire National Academy of Sciences which is .

M: Yes sir, and so are we. So are people like me.

H: Yes. We are a lot of us in the same boat in that case.

M: We sure are.

H: HoweverI'm continuing to be that as it may, it's the phenomenon that I'm interested in

M: And it's there!

H: And this is what I, this is thing that I as a scientist am studying and the Air Force relationships, etc., statements, could be either herenor there as far as the phenomenon is concerned.

M: Very inconsequential, in other words. In other words, you're interested particularly as a scientist to find out the answer

H: Entirely.

M: That's good. That's the kind of language I like and anyway I can help you, if I run across any other facts, I'll write you immediately. But I have lost your address, so if you could send me something.

H: My address is extremely easy. It's simply Department of Astronomy, Northwestern University.

M: Department of Astronomy, Northwestern University.

H: Yes, that's all. Now I hope I do hear from you and if you have any more that you'd like to add to this or any other comments, please write.

M: Well, you see, I have one thing that's very interesting that might help. Now, I have a number of State Patrolmen friends that (they're close friends) and the Missouri State Patrol is a very fine organization, and these men are on the road all the time - one of them lives in the house

[There is a handwritten note at the bottom of the page which appears partially illegible]


- page 5 -

next to mine here - he, if there's anything seen why he'd be the one to
see it, and yet, the Patrol has sort of an official-unofficial attitude
of "Don't see them", you know? But these guys would tell me, and if
anything comes up, you'd never hear about it otherwise.

H Yes, that's it. The only way we can get information is essentially from
private sources.

M That's about right. The state will not cooperate.

H Now that's quite right.

M I wonder if the Air Force even would if it came to somebody seeing one
in their ranks.

H Well, this is problematical, alright. Say, I do want to thank you for
taking this time, and again, let me say that I'm sorry that something
slipped up and we didn't get together.

M Well, I honestly - on my honor I did not receive word. If I had I would
have been there, as in fact Jack & I, the patrolman and I were ready
to meet you. .

H Golly that's a shame.

M When I didn't hear from you I though, well this gentlemen is obviously
run into some consequences which could not be helped and he didn't let
me know exactly when you would be coming in - you did, but I didn't
receive it

H Well, I'm glad I called for several reasons, tonight. One of them is
certainly that we got that straightened out. I was really looking around
for you at the airport and wondering - I thought that something had gone
wrong in your plans had suddenly changed.

M Oh no, when I tell someone I'll be someplace, I'll be there unless some-
thing like this happens where I'm either not notified when to be there

94


- page 6 -

or something of that nature. No, I'm very German, Dr. Hynek, and quite
Prussian even in my ways. Rarely a second late, let alone a minute.
I'm also very thorough and consequently, this is why I am thorough
enough to know that if someone doesn't write me and tell me to be at a
certain place, they must have a reason. You can see my logic.

H     Right.

M     Ok, sir. I'll write you and let you know if anything else I think might
help of or any other sightings or anything I run across.

H     That's just great. Well thanks a great deal.

M     And anytime you're hear, my door's open.

H     Fine, and give my regards to Dr. Wood, even though I never met him.

Mg    I will and you will meet him.

H     Fine. Ok Good night.

M     Good Night.

UFO Sighting of 17 April 67 Near Jefferson City, Missouri

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Lindheimer Astronomical Research Center
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois 60201

1. Reference your letter of 24 April 1969 regarding a conversation between you and Mr. [redacted]. (Reference the UFO sighting of 17 April 67 near Jefferson City, Missouri.) You brought the tape recording of your first conversation with Mr. [redacted] into the Project Blue Book office in the fall of 1968, and although the quality of the recording was poor, there are several portions that have a bearing on the analysis of the UFO sighting. For instance, Mr. [redacted] stated that the object passed almost directly over the airport and that an incoming aircraft also sighted the object. Supposedly the pilot of the aircraft still has the object on his radar at a lower altitude than his aircraft and was huge. (The above is not to be taken as a quote, but is to the best of Mr. Marano's recollection approximately 9 months after hearing the recording.)

2. Both the statements that the object passed almost over the Jefferson City Memorial Airport and that the pilot of an incoming aircraft sighted the object are unsupported by the testimony of the witnesses and the evidence submitted to this office. Therefore, if you would submit the original recording to us, we will make a transcript of as much as possible of the conversation. The tape will be returned to you undamaged along with a copy of the transcript.

Lt. Colonel Hector Quintanilla, Jr., USAF

Department of the Air Force
Headquarters Foreign Technology Division (AFSC)

Dear Hector:

Thank you for your letter of 1 July and its enclosure.
I have recently returned from a fairly extensive trip to
Europe, with the main objective of naming craters of the
far side of the moon, a meeting of a committee of which I am
Chairman.

I found the cases you sent extremely interesting. I
am particularly pleased with your resume of the Cochrane,
Wisconsin sighting and your credit line to me. My only minor
comment is that I would have replaced the word "possibly" by
"probably."

I see no reason to get excited over the Kansas City
sighting. But apparently McDonald can work up a sweat about
anything. I think the analysis of a small balloon, probably
a garden bag net air balloon, is probable. The suggestion
of a firecracker is also reasonable, in view of the date. I
feel that not enough attention has been paid to the date, the
evening before the Fourth of July. The description sounds, to
me, more like some sort of fireworks rather than the plastic
balloon. I am not familiar with all the forms of modern fire-
works. However, I have seen some forms of flares, often
confused with light phenomena. I give little weight to the
parachute. I give little weight to the statement that re-
flected lines are could be seen on the flat bottom surface.
However, the lines of vapor would be quite in keeping with
some sort of flare. There is no way of knowing how far away
it was. They don't know its size. However, the description of
"a shallow inverted bowl" does suggest to me the parachute.

I think that the failure of the Air Force to record any
planes or radar indicates that it was something quite small.
A search of stores in the area might produce a duplicate of
what was observed. The description "light yellow-light blue
fluttering down," is entirely consistent with the fact that those


- page 15 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Lt. Colonel Hector Quintanilla -2-                August 5, 1969

were the kind of phosphorescent sparks so characteristic of
fireworks. The explosion as described is more consistent with
my explanation as fireworks rather than a plastic balloon and
as part of the explosion, some of the falling debris could have
produced the observation of the two heavy parts.

The foregoing is my analysis for what it is worth. I
will be interested in getting your reaction.

With reference to the Jefferson City sighting, I am
certainly not impressed either with the principal observer or
with Hynek's interview with him.

Estimates of size and distance mean absolutely nothing.
The shape is something like a plastic balloon. One cannot help
but wonder about the man's eye condition. However, he was
observing through the windshield and such observations can
always be misleading. Could it, for example, have been a re-
flection of the moon? A person seeing such a reflection, when
driving, will observe it to maneuver. He makes the statement
that "at one time it was directly overhead."

At no time does he indicate that he stopped the car, got
out and observed. He claims that he observed with both binoculars
and a telescope. Most certainly the question should have been
asked whether he tried to observe with these instruments through
his windshield or through the side windows. Were the side windows
up or down? Was the top down? Otherwise how does he know it was
directly overhead? These are vital questions that should have
been asked. I should like to know what his eye correction is.

He advances a fantastic theory to explain the sighting.
From the description I would judge that he has read some of the
more sensational books on UFO propulsion. His insistence that
the object was definitely metal also arouses suspicions about his
accuracy as an observer. Also about his intelligence. And I
think he must have read some of the UFO books that insist that
the Air Force is trying to keep this a secret.

It certainly could have been a plastic balloon, it could
have been a star or planet. If the observer was looking through
the glass of the window or windshield, the distortion could well have
been considerable. At least it could have been a disk rather
than a point as he concluded.

As a final comment, the statement in his interview about
"G forces" again indicates some familiarity with the jargon of UFO.
Finally, I think it is misleading of Hynek to have sent him a
copy of his critical review in the Bulletin of Atomics.

Lt. Colonel Hector Quintanilla                                -3-                                August 5, 1969

Scientists. And I am particularly surprised at his statement that he might have been "used as a foil." What is even more to the point, Hynek's statement that Condon and the entire National Academy of Sciences could also have been used.

Another thing that strikes me as peculiar is his continued reference to "World War I helmet," which is unusual for someone only 25. He claims to have 20-20 vision, but is this with or without glasses?

As for my evaluation, I would say that the object seen could very well have been a garment bag, However, until the questions I have raised about viewing through windows or wind-shields are cleared up, I would not dismiss the possibility of reflections, refractions of the moon, of stars, and possibly of other lights. However, if the interview is reopened, I would strongly suggest that someone other than Hynek ask the questions. He should be asked to reconstruct precisely where he was looking, and how he was looking, and not give him any leading questions. Frankly, I do not trust the judgment of the observer.

Well, Hector, it is easy for me, without any evidence other than in the files you have sent, to sit back and try to reconstruct what might have happened. I can be a long way off. But if I have at least suggested some new leads and new thoughts, I shall be satisfied.

It begins to look as if I shall do the children's book on UFO's. If so, I shall want to get as much photographic material from you as I possibly can.

With my very best regards and many thanks for your continued interest in my evaluations, I am,

Cordially yours,

TRANSCRIPT OF PHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HYNEK & METZ

H: Is Mr. [redacted] there?

M: This is he.

H: Well, Hi, this is Allen Hynek at Northwestern University.

M: How do you do sir. I didn't get to see you when you were down.

H: No, and I'm sorry about that. What happened?

M: Well, I'll tell you what happened. There were several things that happened. 1) I didn't get a phone call telling me when to meet you or letter, and I didn't know exactly when to meet you.

H: Well now, I definitely sent the letter, because ... so something just must have gone wrong, because I was sort of, when I got off at the airport there in Columbia I was looking around for you.

M: Well, the mail service, I guess, didn't come through that time. Probably what happened I built a new home, see, and they probably got the mail confused.

H: Yes. Something must have happened because I was definitely disappointed in not seeing you there. Then, I thought, my reaction, unfortunately, I guess, was the wrong one. I thought to myself, well, He doesn't care enough about this, so

M: No, I care enough about it, but I also am not uncouth and therefore, I wouldn't go where I haven't been intended to go or invited, and so consequently I did not, since I did not receive your letter, or your phone call, I figured that you had made other plans, and I excused it at that level.

H: Yes. Well, two - no runs, no hits and two errors. Uh?

M: Absolutely right. I really didn't - this didn't bother me at all.

Metz - 2

I thought, Well, he has a busy schedule and he obviously had to make other plans. I know university very well, and I thought, well, possibly they insisted on taking him to dinner that evening or something, and knowing that, I just excused it.

Well, so much for that. You'll be probably somewhat disturbed to hear that the Air Force tentatively classified - now I didn't, the Air Force tentatively identified you sighting as a hot air balloon.

I see.

What is your reaction to that?

I think it's funny.

I thought you would.

In fact, I not only think it's funny. I think it's ridiculous.

Because, now the basis for it, however, they did have some basis. It was, your Chief of Police down there, Claude E. Short, finally answered their letter. He wrote, "We are sorry that we have not answered your letter before now. However, I was absent from my desk for several weeks and upon my return I inquired about any complaints being received on any observations of this kind and received word that we did have complaints, so first off let's check what those complaints were. Upon further investigation personally it appeared that some local kids had placed a substance of some sort in a plastic bag that the cleaners use they return garments to customers after they have been cleaned, and after inflating the garment bag in some way the substance gives a lighted effect and it floats off into the air." And this was signed

And I even know the boys that did it.

You do?

Metz - 3

M Oh sure. The Highway Patrolman's son.

H Now that's funny.

M And I know who did it and one of them was a professor at Lincoln's son, (I taught here at Simonson's here for three years and know most of these kids) and they even told me that they were going to do that. And except this one thing. That was not the night that I saw the thing.

H Now that's a nice point. Well, this gives me the information I need because I'm going to be there at Wright Field this Friday and this is one of the cases that they wanted to close out on and I will point out that this is not so easy.

M No, it isn't, sir.

H I hope that I get a chance to really meet you and this- you remarked here that 's wife makes good coffee!

M You're always welcome and if you're ever in this area you're welcome to stay in my home if you wish. I'm sure would love to meet you. He's one of the nicest men that you'd ever meet. And he was my botany professor and we got to be very good friends and still are, and even though that's been many years ago now; I'm in graduate school, and we're still close friends.

H Great! Two other things I want to ask you. First off, when - how many nights before or after the sighting did the garment bag incident occur.

M Oh, that was some time before then.

H Some time before.

M You'd have to know Mr. to understand the letter that they received. I don't want to ride anyone down at all, I don't believe in that, but I know and less his heart, he does the best

36


- page 21 -

job he can, but judging from the letter that you received, it's typical.
The time is wrong, the date is wrong, everything else is wrong. From
what you read he just doesn't make sense. This man is [redacted]

Personally,
I would not. Of course, any one else, they have their opinion.

H   Well, I suspected as much. You really aren't telling me too much that
    I didn't already suspect. Oh yes, another thing I wanted to ask you.
    I take it that [redacted] is still incognito.

H   Yes.    He won't talk.   Absolutely not.

H   I shouldn't say incognito. I should say incommunicado.

H   Yes, he just won't

H   He just won't, huh?

H   He'd just as soon leave it alone.

H   Now, when you folks were looking at this from the airport, you mentioned
    there were three places you stopped. [redacted] At the bluff, at the
    Jenkins Junk Yard, at the Ozark Airport. Are you, is it possible at
    that time, I'm not referring to the first two times, but is it possible
    at that time that you were - it was so far away that it could have been
    mistaken for a star?

M   No, it couldn't, because we had a telescope. We were looking through the
    telescope and as you know even the largest magnitude of star will not

H   will not magnify, quite right.

M will not magnify in a typical 40-power refracting lens, and consequently
this would be an impossibility because this thing did magnify.

H This thing showed a definite, then, apparently showed a definite disk.

M It showed a definite disk.

H Was it in fact spherical, or was it, well, of course, originally, it was
like you say WWI helmet.

M It was still that way, it was obviously. (was a plane) the flat part of
it plane to the ground, if it's possible for anything to be plane in
this Universe.

H Well, this, I'm very glad to have this thing - you know, the first notes
I took on your, on the first talk we had, I must say that I have misplaced
them. I have the report, original report and you have the drawing of
the, well it looks like the helmet and the track it took, and so forth
and I recollect you said something about some objects dropping off
it or out of it.

M Yes sir. There was no door that I could see. This is the thing that
really bothers me. I just absolutely couldn't understand this. Because
within my experience, Dr. Hynek, I have always expected for something
to go out of something, there must be an opening. Well, the brightness
of this thing was not such, once you were out from underneath it, that
you couldn't see it. You know, it was not that bad at all. The terrific
brightness was when I was underneath it when we came over the cliffs.
And so I could see it quite easily and it was right over the flood
plains, the river bottom, overtbis, and I imagine I was no more than
a quarter of a mile from it, and it was huge, you know. I said over
300 feet across, and there were no doors that opened. These objects

seemed to come out of the material, just out of this bright light
underneath the thing. And they took off at unbelievable velocity. The
G forces involved, well they would crush any living thing that I know of.
The rapid rate at which
R Did they go off in the same direction or in . .
M No, one went north and one went east. And I remember that just off hand;
I can never forget it.
H Yes, now, I remember that's what you did say before.
M Yes sir, and you'll have to admit having seen this some time ago, it's
a little difficult to remember each detail. It's so vivid in my mind
from the fact that I did see it. I don't care any one can say anything
they want to, now when people ask me about it I just tell the average
fellow, no I didn't see anything, I was just kidding, because people
think you're an imbecile or something, and in my position - I plan to
teach at the University this summer and also I'm an elementary principal -
H You are a principal of the school now aren't you?
M I am now. And I just don't like the notoriety that this sort of thing.
Well, let me put it this way. In Missouri particularly, Now if I
was among my professor friends, the intellectual group, then I could
discuss this and I have, and there's no problem there. But down here
in the sticks, so to speak, just 30 miles away from the University we're
in the sticks, you just don't see things like that, if you know what
I mean.
H Yes, I know exactly what you mean; the real problem is, "How are we ever
going to get this to, get a real scientific attack on it, because you
know the Condon report is out now. .
