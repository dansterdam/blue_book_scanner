At 2139, my wife noticed a group of bright lights coming over the horizon. See immediately brought our attention to this. She was seated directly toward the East. I was seated to the North and picked up the lights immediately. I watched them disappear over the trees about 40 years away. My neighbor (Mr. ______) got up and went to the other side of the patio where he could see past the trees and saw the lights again. They then disappeared behind another set of trees.
