My dear Colonel:

Pursuant to your letter dated 29 April 1966 and the results provided by the investigation as 22 April 1966 of subject sighting, I have interviewed Mrs. J. J. Witt, and she affirmed that in the summer of last year, a 60 year-old son hung an object on a piece of wire that looked like a saucer and it would not move. She stated the object was about 12 inches in diameter and would just "set" upon investigating same.

Hence it appears the incident was as I did and assured the investigator that it would be so. I am pleased to cooperate with you on matters of common interest.

Very truly,
Richard T. DeScalzo

Gentlemen:
Plfase look into this unusual report, a total of three calls were received at police headquarters in West New York, New Jersey on the night of August 7, 1967, concerning a very unusual and significant sighting of an unidentified aerial object. The reports indicate the object was around 60 to 70 feet in diameter, was very bright and showed a slight reddish glow. It was also reported that there was a hovering sound coming from the object.
My own views and opinion of the matter is that this is a very significant and unexplained event worthy of looking into further. I would suggest that this should be investigated as soon as possible.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if any further information is required.

Considering: commanding
it had mentioned was object was prom in the eer night,
so strange that in this
found that quite difficult to identify.
Form was fairly large, perhaps 50 to 60 fe et in width and perhaps 15 to 20 feet in height.
colord varied and it appeare
black or dark grey in color. naa
There was a little activity below the object, perhaps a heating or some sort of disturbance,
but it was very faint and difficult to identify clearly.
The object seemed to remain stationary for a short period of time, perhaps 5 to 10 minutes.
It then moved off to the north at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.
I hope this description is helpful.
Sincerely,
