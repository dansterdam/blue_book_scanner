Re: TDPT (UFO)
UFO Obser. 7 Aug. 67

My dear Colonel:

Pursuant to your letter dated 29 April 1968 an inquiry into subject information was instituted and the results proved NEGATIVE as far as the reliability of your information.

Upon interviewing Mrs. [redacted], West New York, N. J. this woman recalled that in the summer of 1967 her 13 year old son hung an object on a piece of string in the rear of their home and took a picture of same. The youth then submitted this picture to a science fiction magazine "to see how far they would go" in investigating same.

Mrs. [redacted] expressed her regret that the incident went as far as it did and assured the investigator that it would not happen again. You may be assured that this subject matter may be called a HOAX as far as your records and files are concerned.

It is a pleasure to cooperate with you on matters of mutual concern and interest.

Very truly yours,
Richard T. Warnock
Detective Lieutenant
Commanding Officer

The text on this page is very faint and mostly illegible. While I can see there is handwritten text on the page, I cannot confidently transcribe more than a few partial words or letters. The document appears to be a handwritten document with significant image quality issues that make OCR extremely difficult.


- page 16 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to heavy black redaction marks. There are some faint, blurry lines of text at the top of the page, but they are too unclear to accurately transcribe. Two large black redaction blocks obscure what appears to be the main content of the document.

There is a postmark stamp that is partially illegible, and some vertical lines/barcode at the top left of the document.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a landscape with some foliage on the left side, a building or structure in the background, and what seems to be an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky.

The page is mostly blank with a vertical margin/border on the left side and some black markings/redactions in the center of the page.
