1. Reference the attached report of an unidentified flying object from was observation on the night of 27 October 1965 was probably caused by the planet Venus with a 17 degrees 56 minutes right ascension of 17 hours and 12 minutes and a stellar magnitude of -3.9. This placed the planet at or near the horizon at 240 degrees azimuth.

2. The Air Force Museum is open to the public Monday through Friday from 9 A. M. to 4 P. M. and Saturday and Sunday from 1 P. M. to 5 P. M.

3. The attached brochure will help explain the objectives and results of Project Blue Book to date. No physical evidence is known to exist which supports the contention that unidentified flying objects exist as interplanetary vehicles.

Gentlemen:

I wish to report the sighting of a flying object which my Dad and I
made on the night of Oct. 27th at 9:10 P.M. The object was in the west at about
15 degrees from the horizon. It was a little larger than Venus as it would appear
to the naked eye, and was orange in color. The object appeared to move north a
small distance then it stopped. It appeared to twinkle a little and then just
disappeared from view. It did not go up or down or sideways.

Please advise dates & time your museum is open to the public. Is it true
that you have unidentified flying objects? If so are these objects available
for viewing? I am enclosing a self addressed stamped envelope. Thank you.
