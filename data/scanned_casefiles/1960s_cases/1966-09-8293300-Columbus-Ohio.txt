Dear Mr. [redacted],
We have consulted our Project Blue Book investigative officer concerning the unusual sightings you referred to us in your letter of September 21, 1966. As such, nothing quite like this has been previously reported.
this usually your own best method would seem so utilize an optical illusion since it is most likely the cars attraction was caused by a motion (possibly beyond the range of human hearing) rather than a sighting, form. I am circulating a sighting report form. We cannot assure you that we will disclose her identity, but if this phenomenon should prove to be of sufficient interest, you can assure her, too, that we will not disclose her identity should she choose to submit a report.
Thank you for your interest and cooperation.

Dear Sir:
On September 13, 1966, my wife was cutting grass in our backyard. Our dog started barking wildly at something in the air. (The sky was overcast.) My wife went to investigate and she saw backing, up in the sky, an object which she described as like either a web-like structure or a parachute. She described it as like either a web of ropes or a parachute. The object passed from east to west over our house at about treetop height and disappeared. She was seeing some kind of optical illusion she turned away. But as she did so, the dog began barking again. She looked up and saw the object return and disappear, this time more rapidly. The dog continued barking. "Boy, that's the biggest thing I've ever seen," she said as she came in. As my wife looked at it, the thing disappeared.
Neither my wife nor I would swear that something of substance was there. We feel that they may be only a natural explanation of which we are unaware. On the possibility that information you have received with respect to UFO sightings that seemed to be similar to this one, I would appreciate receiving any comments you may care to make. I'm particularly interested in any comments with respect to the nature of similar alleged sightings, that too, would be interesting.
While I send your reply, I will consult my physician, my ophthalmologist, and my psychiatrist to see if they have any opinions on the matter. Actually, my wife's condition has bothered me considerably, and I would be most grateful to tell her if anyone else had had a similar experience.
Thanks you for your consideration.
Yours very truly,
Director

Dear Sir:

At noon on September 13, 1966, my wife was cutting grass in the yard with our power mower. (She was over-cast.) My wife looked up in the direction in which she was backing the mower. (Toward the northwest) and thought she saw something dark, with some more clear light parts, which she could partially see or like something you might see through the periscope - the thing seemed to be revolving but appeared in the same place. Thinking she was seeing some kind of optical illusion she turned away - But as the dog barked and started to howl, she looked back again, and now the thing had moved to another spot. (Back, see 6) said he saw something black. As my wife looked at it, the thing disappeared.

Whether my wife may I would swear that something of substance was there, unknown to me. If the dog's reaction of which we are both fond, is indicative of the reality, as UFO sightings have turned up similar instances, I should appreciate any comments your agency may have made if you know anything about a similar pattern of observations in the area.

While I await your reply, I will consult my physician, my ophthalmologist, and my psychiatrist to see if they have any opinion. Actually, my wife is quite healthy and well-balanced and was quite reluctant to tell me of this experience at all, thinking I'd just laugh it off. I did, but now I wonder if we did see it would be wise to see.

Thanks you for your consideration.

Yours very truly,
Director

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, dated October 11, 1966, regarding an unusual sighting reported to the project by a Mr. [redacted] in Columbus, Ohio.

The text in the document is as follows:

OCT 11 1966

Dear Mr. [redacted],

We have consulted our Project Blue Book investigative office concerning the unusual sighting you reported to us in your letter of September 15th. They have advised us that nothing quite like this has been previously reported.

On the date that your outdoor dog barked would seem to rule out the dog's attention having been attracted by a sound (possibly beyond the range of human hearing).

I am enclosing some literature and a sighting report form. We should like you to fill out this form, so that we will be able to examine this phenomenon. But, should you wish to make any further comments, you are at liberty to do so. Your identity should, of course, be kept confidential if you submit a report.

Thank you for your interest and cooperation.

Sincerely,

The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book document. There is no photograph present on this page, but rather a sketch and a compass diagram. The text on the page provides instructions for the viewer to imagine a scenario and draw a picture showing the motion of an observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
