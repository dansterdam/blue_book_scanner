Gentlemen,

I understand that projects observed, related to the "Unidentified Flying Object Study" have a sometimes unbased and selftific attitude.

It can assure you that the actions described on the enclosed sheet occurred a month before the coverage to date, was completely unknown to me, and the actions have the earmarks of extremely poor planning or judgment. However, it may be inferred that the events took place as related in that incident that occurred have importance that demands attention.

I am assured that cooperation of the Air force, maintaining the strictest confidentiality, that there are no such reports as "flying saucers" that can be identified as that the identification of the objects have been made to the satisfaction of all, and I would appreciate verification of this to satisfy my personal observation.

Transcribed text:

"According to the undersigned, who wishes to attest to the validity of the following, certain unidentified flying objects at about 7:45 P.M., EDT, on July 14, 1960, over the airspace northeast of Lake Nottawa, Michigan.

My wife and I...were visiting with our two young grandchildren in a southeasterly direction toward the lake when we noticed four very bright light, more like aircraft than those we are accustomed to seeing flying. They were hovering silently in a general southeast direction. 
      
My first impression was that the objects were aircraft at such a distance that their outlines could not be clearly discerned by the naked eye. I thought I could still catch a glimpse while they slowly moved. However, as they slowly separated, they displayed no flashing lights customary on aircraft, nor did they emit any sounds. The objects were perfectly still, except for a slight swaying motion. In the center, and to an oval shape, a pattern of lights about the middle and upper portion was visible. This pattern appeared to move or rotate in a counter-clockwise direction. The objects were very bright and seemed to illuminate the surrounding area. The outlines were hazy, if seen at all, but their brilliance was intense."

The rest of the text describes the observations of the objects in more detail.
