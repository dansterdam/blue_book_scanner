PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 183 20 or 21 Oct 68 2330Z

2. LOCATION: Decatur, Illinois

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 95 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: SSW to WSW

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Other (CONFLICTING DATA)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted a white light that was similar to a star. However after looking at it through a telescope, he decided that it wasn't.

COMMENTS: In observer's original letter, he gave the date of the sighting as 20 Oct 68. In his completed 117 he gave the date as 21 Oct 68. At 6:30PM local Arcturus was at about 23 deg elevation in the west and at 8:05PM local, Arcturus was on the horizon at 302 deg azimuth. It seems quite likely that the observer was looking at Arcturus, however because of conflict in dates the sighting is being saved as Conflicting Data.

FORM: FTD SEP 63 0-329 (TDE)

29. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY WOULD MAKE A NARRATIVE OF THE SIGHTING.

I would like to give the details just as it happened all together. I was outside around 6:30 P.M. The object on caught my eye with an I looked up, and seen the moon; then I looked over and seen the object. It looked as if there was a hole in the sky! Well, I didn't pay much attention to the object and went inside.

After being inside about 30 minutes I walked upstairs to my room, but as I went around the stair case which is in my sister room, my sister said, "Hey, look out here in the ----. So when I did I seen the object, and my mind flashed back to when I seen that hole in the sky at 6:30 P.M. I went around 7:05 P.M. I went and grabbed my telescope which I looked through and focused the object in the viewer. It looked like this - in trails of light which blinked off and on not slowly had red and blue lights on them. Then I took the telescope away from the window and checked for smudges on the window lens which might show if it was the telescope, there were none. Also the moon.

Here is the text from the document:

very low clouds. then i looked up through the
telescope again and the object was shaped
like this. with some points. it seemed
to be the object len the shape of a diamond. it was
here glowing a dark greenish color. not con-
stantly glowing, but not flickering either the
light would dim, but not completely out) and the
glowing real bright. this process altered. it
took about 25 seconds each time. now
about 7:40 PM. My mother hollered
low me to get my bath. I dashed down
and took my bath as quickly as possible
and returned up-stairs and the object had
moved down about 20 degrees in the sky.
suddenly the object shot lighting like bolts
out of the center, which was glowing intensely
(the object was still shaped like this). it
did shoot out these volts of light I felt a
coldness all through me like there was
something or someone telling me to go away,
go away. The object then slowly disappeared in
the WSW.

SAF-OIOC/Miss Turnage/7852/October 23, 1968

Dear [redacted]

This replies to your letter of October 20, 1968, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified serial object.

Had you reported your sighting to Chanute Air Force Base that evening or the next morning, the local UFO investigator would probably have been able to make an accurate evaluation of what you saw. Without additional information, he cannot offer an explanation. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it in the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

We are sending you some newer material on UFO's that may help you to identify the object you saw. In addition, you might be interested in a pamphlet, Aids to Identification of Flying Objects, for sale at 204 each by the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C. 20402.

the telescope up to the window and spred through. After spying the object I focused the lense and saw what seemed to be at comets. (Picture below)

When I took away the telescope and looked at it with my eyes. It still looked like a star. I but when I looked through the telescope again it looks somewhat like & this.

All this time it was glowing willingly. Not bright like a stroke light or a street light but like there was a hole punched in the sky. Kind of weird. It was flickering but not moving at all. My mom yelled at me to come and take my bath so I hurried down and took it. It took me no longer than 20 minutes. I dashed back in my room and grabbed my telescope. But when I got to the window it

Here is the text from the document:

(The object) was partly in sight giving off bolts of light like lightning would. That was lightning because I heard no from thunder and it was now quite outside. Finally the object disappeared in the southwest. I've never seen anything like it before and when it gave off those bolts of light it gave me a kind of tingle through my body. I would have reported it to Chanute Air Force Base but it was now 8:05 P.M. and my mom would have.

never let me. Will
I don't know what else
to say because right now
my mind is wandering.

Please Answer, I

17. DID YOU OBSERVE THE PHENOMENON THROUGH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING? INCLUDE INFORMATION ON MODEL, TYPE, FILTER, LENS, PRESCRIPTION OR OTHER APPLICABLE DATA:

SUNGLASSES
WINDSHIELD
SIDE WINDOW OF VEHICLE
WINDOPANE

CAMERA VIEWER
BINOCULARS
TELESCOPE

OTHER

A. DO YOU ORDINARILY WEAR GLASSES? [YES] [NO]
B. DO YOU USE READING GLASSES? [YES] [NO]

18. WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE SPEED? 10 MPH
PHENOMENON?

19. IN ORDER THAT WE MAY OBTAIN AS CLEAR A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE OF WHAT YOU SAW, DESCRIBE A
COMMON OBJECT OR OBJECTS WHICH, WHEN PLACED IN THE SKY, SIMILAR TO WHERE YOU NOTED THE PHENOMENON,
WOULD BEAR SOME RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT YOU SAW. DESCRIBE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE
COMMON OBJECT AND WHAT YOU SAW:

Well, I would say that the object was mostly similar to a street light. The object had a glow all to itself like a street light, but a street light glows real fuzzy around the edges, but this object changed from real stringlike the moon to a real fuzzy-like the street light. It did not change while glowing, so it was fast like a star - twinkling but not significant so.

21. DID YOU NOTICE INDOOR NOISE, OR HEAR A PHENOMENON OR SEEN UNUSUAL ACTIVITY OF ANIMALS OR MACHINERY IN THE VICINITY? [YES] [NO] IF "YES," DESCRIBE:

No odor, noise, or heat, but in the last few minutes it was in sight, I was out lighting wire that was not lighting because I was near wires and quite outside.
