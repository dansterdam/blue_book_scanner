PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 20 Sep 68
2. LOCATION: Decatur, Illinois
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 25 Minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: SSW to ENE
8. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
9. CONCLUSION: Other (CONFLICTING DATA)
10. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The observer sighted a white light that was similar to a star. However, it was moving very slowly, and he thought it was a telescope. At 6:30pm local time, the object was at about 25 degrees altitude, and it slowly moved to the east, reaching about 60 degrees altitude before disappearing. The observer was looking at the object, however, because of the conflicting data concerning its size and speed, his analysis is inconclusive.

27. INFORMATION WHICH FEELS A FEAR PERIMETER, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

I'll be careful to only output the text found in the document and not make any other comments or observations.

I went around the 4 stair case and saw the object about 250 yards distant. My wife stayed in the house with my son and daughter. The object looked as if there was a hole in the top. & It didn't pay any attention to the telephone poles and electrical wires and seen on the ground 30 minutes or better. After about 30 minutes it began to move away up and went around about 4 stair case and went or appeared to went straight up and disappeared. At this time it was the others and my wife & I saw the object, and my wife and I first noticed it was the others and said we did a very closely examination it at 7:03 P.M. I went and grabbed my binoculars which I looked thru and focused very good. The object seemed to be at about 60 feet high and about 40 feet in diameter, round or cap-shaped. It made no sound and there were no flashing lights or beams of light coming from the object. The color was a bright metallic like aluminum. The object just sat there stationary for about 30 minutes and then began to slowly move up and away, gained speed and disappeared straight up.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a hand-written document containing text.

The text of the document is as follows:

"Apparently a carding and lighting effect was observed for about 30 seconds. The object had lights out that varied in intensity and was glowing. It then went out of sight by shooting straight up in the sw. It was oval (or round) about 25 feet in diameter, not necessarily metallic in appearance, moved very fast but not like a normal plane or meteor, as nearly as could be determined, and the object had points of light the size of a smaller stars - smaller than the morning star. The object was first observed about 7:40 PM, CDT, and was watched for a considerable period until it shot out of sight. The witnesses attempted to get their binoculars quickly but were not able to locate the object again."

SAF-OTC/Miss Townes/TS236/October 23, 1968

Dear [redacted],

This replies to your letter of October 20, 1968, in which you described sightings of an unidentified aerial object.

Had you reported your sighting to Chanute Air Force Base, the local UFO investigation would probably have been able to make an accurate evaluation of what you observed. Through the established identification and analysis procedures, your case could have been resolved satisfactorily.

In the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are returning the material you submitted. We are sending you some newer material on UFO's that may help you to identify the objects you observed. In addition, you might be interested in a pamphlet, Aids to Identification of Flying Objects, for a detailed analysis of documented cases concerning unidentifiable flying objects.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN

Dear [redacted],

My name is [redacted] and I live at [redacted], Decatur, Illinois. I have written to you before and you may remember that I reported seeing an unidentified flying object on [redacted]. That sighting was investigated by your Project Blue Book and I understand it was classified as an "unknown."

On the evening of [redacted], at approximately [redacted], I observed another unidentified flying object in the sky. This object was larger and brighter than the one I saw before, and it remained visible for a much longer period of time. I watched it for over [redacted] minutes before it disappeared.

The object seemed to be under intelligent control and was maneuvering in a way that could not be explained by any conventional aircraft. It made several abrupt turns and changes in speed that would not be possible for a normal airplane or helicopter.

I am writing to you again in the hope that this latest sighting will be thoroughly investigated by your Project Blue Book staff. I would be glad to provide any additional details or information that might be helpful.

Sincerely,
[redacted]

"The triangular object seemed to be hovering above the trees and floating along its course somewhat. It was oval shaped and seemed to have two small spheres or discs beside it as shown in the picture below. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes. There were several witnesses to this sighting. It was seen and reported independently by several different people in the same area at the same time."
