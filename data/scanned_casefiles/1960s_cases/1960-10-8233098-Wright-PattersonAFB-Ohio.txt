The image does not contain any photographs. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or coin's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the length of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match stick?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give me as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image contains three sketches. The first sketch depicts the sighting of an object above the horizon, showing how high the object was from the observer's perspective. The second and third sketches show larger views of the object's position compared to the initial sighting.

Text extracted from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
