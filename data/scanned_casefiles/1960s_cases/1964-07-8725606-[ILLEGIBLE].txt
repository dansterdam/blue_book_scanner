I saw the object for more than 3 or 4 seconds. My best
estimate of its speed is between 20° and 30° of angular
displacement per second. An actual estimate of velocity
was difficult since there was no basis for estimating
altitude. There was no detectable sound associated with
the object. As I watched this odd spectacle, I fortunately
thought to estimate the size of the object. This was very
difficult to guess confidently; however, I would say
that the dimension along the major axis would have covered
from 1/2 to 3/4 the diameter of a full moon.

I cannot and will not attempt to conclude anything further
since it could only amount to speculation. I must confess,
however, an outstanding curiosity as to what official stand
the Air Force is taking on this sort of thing. Certainly,
I'm not the only one who has witnessed such a phenomenon.
In this, I have an electronics engineer, employed by
Electro-Optical Systems, Incorporated, of Pasadena, and usually considered to be reasonably sane, if
not conservative, particularly about UFO's. I hope this
report will serve some purpose, if only to corroborate re-
ports by other witnesses.

Sincerely,

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDSN
SUBJECT: Request For UFO Information

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI PD (Mr Gaiser)
WASH DC 20330

1. Reference the attached letter from _________ regarding an observation on the night of 13 July 1964.

2. The general description of Mr._________ sighting indicates the possibility of a meteor observation. The duration of three to four seconds and the angular velocity and the distinct flight are consistent with this evaluation. However, no tail or trail was reported. The distance of the object could be attributed to the limited portions of the windshield and possibly atmospheric conditions at that time.

3. It is suggested that an FTD Form 164 be sent to Mr. _________ in order that we may make a more complete analysis.

Dear Mr.

Our Project Office at Wright Patterson Air Force Base has investigated your report of an unusual phenomena on July 13, 1964.

While the general description of your sighting indicates the possibility of a meteor observation, the fact that you observed the fall makes it impossible to state arbitrarily that it was a meteor.

Enclosed is an Air Force OTD Form 164. It is requested that you complete this form as much as detail as possible and return it to this Headquarters. (Upon receipt of the form, another attempt will be made to evaluate the sighting.)

Sincerely,

Dear Sirs:

I am 14 years old and my house is located north east
of the center of town. I have been around airplanes nearly
all of my life and I can truly say that what a friend and
I saw on the night of July 14, 1964, at about 9:30pm was
no aircraft that we had ever seen. They came out of the
west at about 2 miles in altitude. at this point they
were very faint and were only one two. They were bluish
white in color and were flat except for a slight rounded
edge. In the fog scattered. They were losing altitude fast.
They moved until they were over the north edge of Odessa.
As about 1500 ft. then they landed and instead of two there
were four. They, so far, had been very faint, but now the
bottom was very clear. They were several times brighter
than any other star in the sky. I have seen ships like this
several times before, but at greater altitudes so I now
what they were. These ships were as plain as looking at
house a block away and knowing it was a house. they hovered
in that position, pausing for about 2 or 3 minutes. I had
started timing them when I first saw them, then they leveled
off and were gone in about 30 seconds toward the west. My
friend, Jimmy Murry, can verify this.

I could truly say that these ships were flying saucers
closer and plainer than my I hope to see again. I can also
say that I now know that saucers do exist.

P.S. They were flying in this formation:

On 8 Jul 64 a telephone call was received from SASO at 1345 local time regarding a multiple observation of a possible satellite decay at the U-Diamond Ranch near Tensleep, Wyoming. At 1232½ an experienced near Tensleep, Wyoming. At 1232½ an experienced pilot observed an object emitting blue flame once the earth atmosphere from the WNW heading WSW, object was observed for 2 seconds. About two minutes after entry some good was heard. Mr. D Gwyer of the state Highway commission observed a brief flying object at 1230 ½ through the object was a jet which exploded. Mr Gwyer was 25 miles SW of Sheridan, Wyoming. Apparently burned up in air no place was found.

Sig 1 Moody called Capt Lanay, TAOS, place the object was heading WSW, retro-grade to normal satellite decay. On call 9 Jul 64 call number CY-335, Sgt Moody called ENT AFD for possible decoy information. Analyst at SPADAS had already received the report and had checked details with negative results. No decay on 8 Jul 64. Since the object had all characteristics of a meteor and was heading WSW case is considered as a meteor observation.

Dear Sir:

This report is being made at the advice of USAF Colonel James D. Hunter, Chief of the Los Angeles Office of Information.

On the evening of July 13, 1964, at 10:35 (within two or three minutes) PST, I saw an object--unlike anything I have ever seen before--flying across the sky. From my vantage point, the object had an elliptical silhouette such that the dimension along the flight path was about twice that of the transverse axis. The object would have been too dark to be readily noticeable except for a faint yellowish to greenish glow flickering close about the periphery.

I first noticed the object through the tinted portion of my automobile windshield. It was traveling horizontally from my right to my left. As I was parked facing the south, the object must have been going in a generally an easterly direction. Upon realizing that what I saw was something unusual, I held my head out of the open window to make sure I wasn't seeing a reflection and continued to watch until the object disappeared.

From the relative positions of the tinted windshield and my eyes, I afterward was able to estimate that the object had been some 30° to 40° above the horizon. Although the description of the observation is somewhat long drawn out, the actual occurrence took place very quickly. I doubt if...
