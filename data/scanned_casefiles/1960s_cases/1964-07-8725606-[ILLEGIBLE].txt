Secretary of the Air Force
23 July 1964
page two

I say the object for more than 3 seconds at any best estimate should be back. This estimate is between 1/2 and 1/3 of a second. Since there was no basis for estimating the size of the object, this estimate would be very difficult to guess accurately. I would say: 
The outline of the object continuously / I would say very slightly exceeded the range of apparent movement from 1/2 to 3/4 the diameter of a full moon.

I cannot accurately estimate or conclude anything further. As you conclude anything you would be speculating and asking my opinion on this sort of thing certainly I am not in a position to give you any sort of reliable information except to record an optical appearance observed by electro-optical systems. I incorperated, if accurate and fully considered, by other personnel who have witnessed such an experience. The report will serve some purpose, if only to corroborate reports by others witnesses.

Sincerely,

REQUEST FOR UFO INFORMATION

1. Request Spot (Mr. DELANCE)
15 JULY 1963

Reference the attached report regarding an observation on the night of 15 July 1963.

The general description of Mr. DELANCE, the duration of the sighting, and what he observed is considered to be of interest. However, no call or card or Mr. DELANCE was found in files and it is believed that no evaluation or sighting report was previously submitted.

It is suggested that an AFD Form 16+ be sent to Mr. DELANCE in order to secure further details.

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Our Project Greige at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has investigated your report of an unidentified flying object observed on July 11, 1964. Included with this correspondence is the official report of our investigation.

The investigation indicates that your sighting was of an experimental aircraft from the [REDACTED] Air Force Base. It is impossible to state conclusively that it was a known aircraft, but the evidence suggests it was a recognized military test vehicle.

I understand this may be disappointing, but it is important that we strive to identify and explain all reported sightings. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter, and any additional information you can provide will be helpful.

Sincerely,

MARION M. JACKS

Project Blue Book
December 29, 1964

Dear Sir:
I am 75 years old and my house is located north east of the coal mine of the town of Bates, Ohio. It is truly amazing that anything like this should happen. On July 14, 1964, at about 2:45 a.m. my attention was attracted by a brilliant light that appeared to be hovering over a wooded area about 1/2 mile from my house. The light was white in color and was flat according to our local pastor, who lives near me. They were flat on the top and bottom and roughly oblong in shape. I would estimate the size of this object as being about 30 ft. in diameter. There was no sound coming from it and I watched it for about 100 yds. and then it appeared to black away and disappear. Instead of two lights, there was only one. This was not any other aircraft that I am familiar with.
I know there are many unidentified flying objects in the sky. I have never seen anything like this before. It was a most unusual sight and I am still wondering what it really was. I can only say that I saw it with my own eyes and it was not an airplane or any other craft that I know of. I hope that this information will be of some help to you.

Sincerely,
[ILLEGIBLE]

on 8 Jul 64 a telephone call was received from SAFOI at 1245 local
stating a multiple observation of a possible metallic display
over WALDEN CO. According to information received at the 2035 local
time 8 Jul 64 The object appeared to be 10-15 feet in diameter,
shaped like a mushroom, and flew across the sky from NW to SE at an
altitude of about 20,000 feet. the starboard from the main heading
was observed. About ten minutes later a "second object" similar observed
at 1340 8 Jul 64. This second object was under 3,000 feet and appeared
slightly larger than the first. No sound or exhaust was observed.
According to TEAD OP Center, the object was probably a jet which
appeared to be under manual control, descending normally, rather
than a guided missile or saucer shaped craft. Capt Larney,
TDY03, stated the object was heading 300-320 degrees. It was decided
that no photographs should be checked tomorrow, 9 Jul.

The Air Force SMDt SMD telephone CaII number 63-8725606, dated 8 Jul 64, was received,
which stated that information from a reporting party in the WALDEN CO, Colorado area
indicates that a "metallic appearing object" was observed in the sky at about 1440Z,
8 Jul 64. Duration of this observation was approximately 10 minutes. The object was described
as being an estimated 10-15 feet in diameter, a mushroom shape, flew at an altitude of
approximately 20,000 feet, and was observed to fly from northwest to southeast. A second
metallic appearing object was observed at about 1340Z, 8 Jul 64, at an altitude under 3,000
feet and appeared slightly larger than the first. No sound or exhaust was observed. As there
is no decay on 8 Jul 64. Since the object had apparent normal characteristics, no further
photo coverage or interrogation is planned.

(CHIEF OF BLUE BOOK OFFICER)

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20330

Dear Sir:

A report is being made at the advice of USAF Colonel James E. Hunter, Chief of the Los Angeles Office of Information.

On the evening of July 13, 1964, at 10:35 (within two or three minutes), I saw an object hovering about 10 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be about 2 degrees in diameter or about the size of a penny held at arm's length. The object had a silhouette distinctly shaped much like a waterdrop. The object was lighted in a manner somewhat like the transverse axis of the object. The object would have been 3,250 yards or less from my observation point. The object remained motionless for about five seconds.

I first noticed the object through the tinted portion of my windshield. As I was parked facing the south, the object came into my vision area. It was parked facing the south, the object came into my vision area. It was parked apparently in a hover. As I glanced at it, it started to move off at a great rate of speed and went out of sight in about ten seconds in a northern direction.

From the relative positions of the tinted windshield and my eyes, I could estimate that the object had been some 300 to 400 above the horizon. Although the object I observed was in the Southern sky, and drawn out the actual occurrence took place very quickly. I doubt if any photographs were taken.
