This object appeared so quickly & disappeared so quickly there was no time for a real good look. When I told my family about it the next day they kidded me about seeing things. I couldn't give up the thought that there really was something that I had seen. My son brought home a book from the Milan High School library the next day, the title which was I believe "Flying Saucer Conspiracy" and it was from that book I got the address that I wrote to to make my report. I thought it was strange no one else reported seeing anything. No report on our local radio station, or WCCO Minneapolis nor in the newspapers.

Director of Intelligence
Headquarters 21, 8.9. A.F.
Washington 25, D. C.

Gentlemen;

On November 20, at 12:20 A.M., I saw a circular luminous object from my bedroom window. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and so low I thought it would crash into the house. There was no sound. It gave off a white light and it was brighter than a full moon on a clear night. I have seen weather balloons, satellites and shooting stars and this object was unlike any of those. It was traveling in a westerly direction.

Yours truly,

[Signature area is blacked out]

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

No change in direction

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? A little larger than a full moon. A full moon is in Minn. 6 AM mid-winter

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

The match head would have covered such a very small part of the object that it would be hard to make an accurate comparison.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, it passed over the house

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

A full moon but larger. It was circular. I would say that it was a perfect circle.
