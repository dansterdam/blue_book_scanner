Tuesday, Nov.14, '67

Dear Sir:

On the night of Nov. 4, 1967, my brother spotted a U.F.O. 
It was around 7:05 p.m. E.S.T. He were in front of our house 
at allahassee, Florida. We saw it for about 15 minutes. We know 
it was at this time and length because my brother was going to 
a club meeting and was being timed and was being 
picked up at 7:15 and he went out about 7:00 and we saw it for 
15 minutes afterwards until it left in sight for a whole 
time except when it went behind trees for no more than 10 
seconds.

It was a bright light, and round and the moon
was bright. It was a clear dry night. 
The object was light but a little dimmer than the moon 
and the stars. It was lighter than the dim star but not as 
bright as the bright stars. There was nothing unusual about it, except 
that it seemed brighter and but if you looked at it steadily 
could hear. If you held a first tooth-pick at arms 
length it would be a little smaller than its width. 

I couldn't tell you the approximate speed, but it was 
going so fast to be just a star and had no sound.

I looked at it through binoculars and I've enclosed a 
drawing of what it showed.

It was at about at a 45 degree-angle with the horizon 
when I first saw it. It traveled about a 90 degree angle when 
I lost say it. First it traveled about SW, then turned to N. 
Then turned to NE.

Beside myself and my brother, my mother saw it too. 

Tallahassee, Florida 32303
I'm 16 yrs. old

A little while after I saw this object I called a friend 
of mine who's father work at the Weather Bureau, he said 
that there would be nothing up there that would do that 
unless it could possibly be a plane which I seriously doubt.

The image contains a photograph depicting a geometric diagram. The diagram appears to show an angle with several lines and symbols labeled as "A", "B", and "a". There is also handwritten text at the bottom of the image that says "It appeared on a hillout somewhat and to cover about 35 yards".

The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The one on the top appears to be a compass rose or wind rose diagram, showing directions like north, south, east, and west. The two sketches on the bottom appear to show some kind of landscape or horizon view.

OCR output:

6A. HOW FACING YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION WHICH THE WITNESS STATES THE OBJECT FIRST APPEARED. THEN, PLACE A Ø ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION WHICH THE OBJECT LAST SEEN.

F. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND PLACE A Ø AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW ARROWS TO INDICATE ANY MOVEMENT OR CHANGE IN POSITION. MATCH
YOUR SKETCH TO THE POSITION OF THE COMPASS ROSE AS YOU INDICATED IT ABOVE. INCASE OF AN OBJECT SEEN HOVERING, CENTER
