Here is the text from the document:

1. DATE - TIME: October 27

2. LOCATION: Tallahassee, Florida

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 minutes

6. CONCLUSION: Possibly Unknown. (There is a 5 minute discrepancy in some of the details, and no explanation could not have been so mysterious.)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Since the observer gives no real analysis, there was a vague idea to deny this time, it is conceivable that this could be a misidentification.

Observer spotted an object that resembled an elongated star. The light was brighter than dimest stars and dimmer than the brightest. Observer noted that it was going to pass to be small and be an aircraft and reported it because of its strangeness.

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL, ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED IN MOTION, SUCH AS ROTATION, AND INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

[Handwritten note in the drawing area]: Acted size through eyeglasses

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR 1-1/2 MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW IF YOU HAD HELD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

[Handwritten response]: Should have covered about 1/2 of a match head

Tuesday, Nov. 14, '67

Dear Sirs,

On the night of Nov. 4, 1967, my brother spotted a U.F.O.
It was around 7:05 P.M. E.S.T. We were in front of our house
at _______ Drive, Tallahassee, Florida. We saw it for
about 15 minutes. We know it was at this time and length
because my brother was going to a club meeting and was being
picked up at 7:15 and he went out about 7:00 and we saw it for
a couple minutes after he left. It was in sight for the whole
time except when it went behind trees for no more than 10
seconds.

It was a bright night and there many stars and the moon
was bright. It was a clear, dry night.

The object looked like an elongated star and the edges were
blurred. It was lighter than the dimmest stars but not as
bright as the brightest stars, although it favored more to
the brighter stars. There was nothing usual about it except
that it followed a strange path. It didn't make any sound that
we could hear. If you held up a flat toothpick at arms
length it would be a little bit smaller than its width.

I couldn't tell you the approximate speed but it was
going to fast to be that small and be an airplane. Yet saw for 15 min?

I looked at it through binoculars and I've enclosed a
drawing of what I saw.

It was at about a 45 degree angle with the horizon
when I first saw it and at about a 60 degree angle when
I last saw it. First it traveled about SW, then turned to N,
then turned to NW.

Besides myself and my brother, my mother saw it too.

My name is Tom White
Tallahassee, Florida 32303

I'm 16 yrs. old

A little while after I saw this object I called a friend
of mine who's father works at the Weather Bureau. He said
that there would be nothing up there that would do that
unless it could possibly be a plane, which I seriously doubt.

In the sky it looked
about like this:

Through binoculars it
looked about like this:

Pass the altitude in a
A, can distinguish some
definite lines

The path not like this:
