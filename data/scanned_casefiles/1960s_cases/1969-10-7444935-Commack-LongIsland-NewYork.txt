My husband and I were in the driveway. After we noticed the sighting from inside the car through the front window, we pulled, my husband managed to the car. The car was stopped. I reported that the object was bright silver. I cannot be sure of it appeared to be silver because of the extremely bright moon of that night.

Very truly yours,

Gentlemen:

On Sunday, October 26, 1969, at approximately 7:15 P.M., my husband and I were in Commack, L.I.N.Y., in the area of Village Hill Drive. This is a sparsely populated residential area.

We saw an object in the sky that was hovering above a large tree. Suddenly the object started moving at a rapid pace. As the object drew closer we saw that it had three lights on it. The red and the blue lights seemed to be revolving around one another, while the green light was stationary. It appeared to be much larger than a passenger plane. The flying object did not have any sound. It was silent and moved at a fantastic speed.

The object increased altitude suddenly. It did not move like a jet or an airplane. It went straight up and was out of sight in a matter of seconds.

We are reporting this sighting because we feel we saw an unidentified flying object.

If you need any additional information do not hesitate to contact us.

Very truly yours,

[Signature and address details are blacked out]

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THIS COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
