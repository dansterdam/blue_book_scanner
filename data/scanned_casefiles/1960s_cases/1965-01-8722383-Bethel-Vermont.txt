The text on this page is partially illegible due to the image quality. I can make out some words and partial sentences, but many parts are difficult to read clearly. The text appears to be a handwritten document with multiple lines of writing. At the bottom of the page, there is a black oval shape that appears to be redacting or obscuring some information.

The portions of text I can discern include fragments like:
"...to make..."
"...very..."
"...with you..."

However, I cannot confidently reproduce the full text due to the poor legibility of the document.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Note: Some parts of the text are difficult to read clearly, so I will transcribe what I can confidently make out]

[Top of page appears to have a title, but it is partially illegible]

"...of Two Different Group"

[Main text begins, but first few lines are partially obscured]

"As we were going about 7 miles south of Randolph, Kansas, we noticed three bright objects in the sky. They were traveling in a formation of a triangle..."

[The rest of the text continues, but due to the image quality, some sections are difficult to read completely. The document appears to be a UFO sighting report with details about an observation of three bright objects in the sky.]

[There are handwritten notes on the left margin of the document, but they are not clearly legible.]

[The bottom of the page contains additional text, but again, the image resolution makes full transcription challenging.]

Would you like me to attempt a more detailed transcription, acknowledging that some parts may be inaccurate due to image quality?

Here is the text from the document:

[First column, partially cut off]
...driving along
to the road toward Bethel
and... about 4:30 or 5
p.m. I was driving along
the... to our left, an object came
into my view...

"The trooper said, 'My God,
what is that?'"

"Just then a second car came
to view. It was three cars coming up the valley in our direction."

"Then came a third, exactly
like the first two, only two,
also, just like that."

"I was driving and I went
over to the side of the road,
right side, or 150 or 160 feet
to the side of the road, so
that they were traveling so fast
we felt they were traveling."

[Second column]
TWO MORE OBJECTS

"We were driving along four
miles an hour. They were
way up in the sky. They
were traveling very fast."

"Then after a while, I
stopped. We were driving
along the flat. We were
driving along the flat that
was before you go to Pittsie
Flat. We were driving on
the road. I stopped the car.
I was facing west. I was
stopped to see what it was.
It was... I went to
get out of the car to go
back at the road. Before we
got out of the car, the objects
went up the hill by the Rogers
house and just as the top of the
hill's barn was that third one,
This one was only about 1/2 mile
long and only a car."

[Circled section]
"About 8 o'clock, the same time as Dr.
Woodard's had reported, he said
he believed Woodard must have
been in one of the cars."

[Bottom right column]
ANY MORE?

"We were glad to receive any
other accounts of strange sightings in the White River Valley."

"My, someone mentioned,
the objects seen last week were
seen from our car, just looking
for snow and leaving this valley
in 1963."

"Women like a strong, silent
man because they think he is
listening."

Cambridge 38, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Webb:

I was advised in a communication of May 25, 1964, from Mr. Richard Hall that reports of UFO should be forwarded to you for analysis.

Accordingly, I am enclosing a clipping from the Burlington Free Press of January 8 which refers to a UFO sighting on January 12 at about 5:00 pm about three miles north of Bethel, Vermont, on a road.

I have talked personally with Dr. Richard S. Woodruff, State Pathologist at Burlington, and Corporal Norris Woodward of the State Police Identification Bureau, here in Montpelier.

The sightings were made from a car which was being driven by Cpl. Woodward. Both men saw the UFO simultaneously as they did the two following UFOs. Dr. Woodruff's impressions were to the effect that the flight path was relatively horizontal from west to east across the highway as their car was proceeding north; Cpl. Woodward describes it as more of a rising from the ground east to an elevation of 25°-35° and returning to the ground east of the highway. Cpl. Woodward tells me the object was a visible call of flame, both men agree that it was more or less round, and was more of a glow than a ball of fire. Dr. Woodruff describes it as orange-red.

Cpl. Woodward refers to it as "more on the red".

There was no noise at any time. The objects were in view only a few seconds each.

Special between the three sightings was several seconds each. Cpl. Woodward placed the height of the object in approximate 200-300' above the ground; Dr. Woodruff stated it was low, but did not estimate altitude.

Mr. Walter Webb                                                8 January 1965

The flight path of the three sightings appeared to be fixed inasmuch as the three sightings was through the top of the car windshield at which point the car appeared to be "almost underneath" the flight path.

Both agree that two cars passed them in the opposite direction within a few seconds of the sightings. Cpl. Woodward recalls having followed a car ahead of him for some distance, and noted that this car eventually lost some 12 to 15 miles in Randolph. This was not contained in his report, but as of writing no other reports of sighting have been received. In this possible to locate these men in Randolph at, as it appeared, they were en-route to work in a local mill.

In the event you wish to make further contact, the addresses of the observers is:

University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont

Cpl. Ronald Woodward, Assistant Superintendent

Bailey Avenue Extension
Montpelier, Vermont

The only explanation occurring to me is the possibility of an Air Force tanker and refueling operation which may have been in progress, but this does not explain the rapid flight or the close spacing. During such refueling, the tankers on clear nights are lighted occasionally for easy identification. These operations usually originate at the Plattsburgh, New York, Air Force Base. I have not checked as to whether a refueling operation might have occurred in the area at that time.

Very truly yours,
Commissioner

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 1958

A report on the Bethel, Vermont, sighting of 8 January 1965.

This case was investigated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek who visited Bethel, Vermont and Burlington, Vermont, to interview Doctor [redacted]. After an essentially all day investigation, the conclusion of the interviewer is that, with a high degree of probability, the sighting was that of tracer bullets fired over the highway from a wooded elevation immediately adjacent to the road and rising from it. Statements of the two Randolph men, [redacted] and [redacted] which seem to have the most weight, were that "the trajectories and general appearance of the luminous balls were exactly like those of tracer bullets he had seen many times during World War II."

In addition to this statement, it is well-known that there are lads in the neighborhood who are given to playing pranks. It is relatively easy to obtain such tracer shells in the open market; and that there were no laws in Vermont prohibiting the use of same. It is quite understandable that even mature observers traveling along the highway would be taken by surprise by such an unexpected and unusual observation.

In view of the statements of the witnesses interviewed it seems highly likely to the interviewer that the sighting was indeed the result of the firing of tracer bullets across the highway.

Attached is additional data pertinent to the UFO Report transmitted by me on 18 January 1965. The sighting of three (3) UFOs between Bethel and Randolph, Vermont - Highway 810 on 4 January 1965 by State Trooper Ronald J. Woodward at approximately 5:15 P.M. EST.

The additional data is recorded on a standard NICAP UFO Questionnaire which was filled out one signed by Trooper Woodward. He has asked that this name be kept confidential. Except for minor differences in time and distance estimates, his report is substantially the same as that of Mr. Woodward's report. His supporting testimony is valuable especially in that he is a well qualified observer.

I would comment that some of the recent sightings in Washington, Virginia and Maryland are of similar objects to that reported in the above-mentioned sighting.

Respectfully submitted,

Attention: Major Maston M. Jacks

Dear Major Jacks:

Thank you for your prompt return letter of 27 January informing me of the USAF contact of one UFO sighting made by Dr. Richard Woodruff and a Vermont State trooper - i.e. a probable observation of meteors, spectacular chandelier-like meteor showers. Thank you also for the quick-reference sheet for meteor showers which will be easier to refer to than the somewhat technical language in reference.

I will send a copy of your letter to Dr. Woodruff and the State trooper. I am sure they will appreciate comments concerning it and send a copy of such to you for information purposes.

These sightings throughout the U.S. are increasing at a phenomenal rate. Some of them are taking place in Washington, Virginia and Maryland area - right in your backyard so to say! I realize that this agency cannot, and justifiably cannot, take for the present official approach to the UFO problem.

However, some plain talk about the world, etc. may be their philosophy. However, I sincerely hope that some plain and public information concerning UFOs must be told. What really disturbs me is that the public is being prepared for the fact that the public is seldom seemingly is waiting until it has been told the truth. This is very dangerous for those who do something in this area.

In response to the USAF evaluation, I would like to make a few comments concerning our subcommittee and our evaluation of this particular UFO report. Our Massachusetts subcommittee - particularly A Aeronautical Engineer, an Advanced Radar Research Engineer, A Radio Engineer, A Chemical Engineer, A Public Relations man and myself, the present Chairman. Some of these men hold key positions in the Electronics Industry and are developing a ground Electronics System for the USAF Minuteman Missile at Sylvania. One member has worked for the USAF on a Navy radar and has a position at Harvard Observatory in the field of Radio Astronomy.

I mention these 7 is to assure you that our documenting is technically-trained group who are genuinely concerned in the investigation and evaluation of mile 90 Vanner Civilian and others who have unfortunately created a "secondary UFO problem" in addition to the main one.

Meteors, of course, were immediate suspects but because of the high caliber of the witnesses involved and their description of the object, it was decided that a UFO report should be filed. The following facts tend to negate the "unknown solution" although, of course, they do not in themselves prove that the objects were not meteors.

I. THE QUADRANTED METEOR SHOWER

A. DATE:
1. Maximum - January 3
2. Minimum - January 1-4

B. RADIANT POINT OF: (i.e. where they appear to emanate from)
1. General region of Constellations Bootes and Ursa Major
2. Carefully with this radiant point's approximate hour of culmination (highest point) observed 10:00 PM and 11:00 AM in the morning at Randolph, Vermont
3. It was located just above or below the approximate Radiant Point:
   a. At these matters could be observed at all at this time, they would appear to emanate from the western horizon and disappearing over the eastern horizon

C. FREQUENCY OF:
1. At 9:15 PM, the frequency of meteors sighted at this time would be at almost the lowest ebb because at this time we are facing in the opposite direction of the earth's motion
2. BUT the witnesses observed 3 in rapid succession!

II. CHARACTERISTICS TENDING TO RULE OUT METEORS IN THIS SITUATION

A. SIZE: Between the size of a grapefruit or football held at arm's length, 1 large or 3 near about, anyone seeing 3 meteors in a row with this apparent size!

B. DEFINITION: Sharply defined, unlike a glowing meteor

C. TRAIL: No visible trail. Very unusual for a meteor, especially of this size!

D. SHAPE: Each of the 3 objects were identical in shape (and size). There was no change in shape or disintegration such as is usually expected in large meteors.

E. ALTITUDE: An apparent 200-500 feet over the highway.


- page 19 -

Here is the text from the document:

P. DISTANCE: 1/8 - 1 mile estimated.

G. FLIGHT PATH: Each followed an identical Flight Path. Very unusual if they were meteors, especially meteors of this size, which were so clearly a 1 do not think even large bolides are of this size.

Thus, you can see why a UFO Report was filed. In addition, if one takes into consideration the fact that both witnesses were probably seen many meteors before, yet did not even entertain the possibility and that a similar UFO was both reported in the New England States and this time, he would at least be suspicious of the meteor answer.

I apologize for the length of this letter and do not expect an answer. I am writing you CFIDS (a very busy scientific research group) "Pro-pto first (9)" so to say. I wonder if this sudden burst of UFO activity has any meaning. We do wish the close approach of Mars in August.

Enclosed are several newscales for your information. I am corresponding with the witnesses. Walter Webb of Hayden Planetarium was planning to interview one of the witnesses. I will be in Hyannis to interview another. A friend of mine who subscribes to a nationwide (slipping service) informs me that he received a large number of UFO clippings last week. A Hawaiian UFO investigating group in Honolulu is studying this system is intensely interested in this aspect of UFO's and is here some time back. They seem to be looking to what kind of a propulsion system would cause these side effects.

I am enclosing some trained people some of whom have received "black magic" information from a group in Hawaii. These people have been concerned by many highly-technical men where I am employed and has received very credible comments. With your help, I will be able to make some medical job in order of its lack of resources. Well, I've enclosed an inquiry and will close now. Thank you again for your response.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Fowler:

Please excuse the delay in answering your letter of February 1st, but our medicolegal work has been so heavy these past few weeks that I have been out of the office a good part of the time and have not had an opportunity to respond as quickly as I probably should have done. With reference to the letter you received from Major Jacks of the Air Force, my only comment concerning this, is that I am amazed that the major could not come up with a better solution than this...

While I do not feel free to comment concerning Trooper Woodward's experience with meteors, although I am quite sure that he is able to recognize one when he sees it, I can say for myself that you were quite accurate in your answer to Major Jacks. I have seen numerous meteors in the past and, if I had thought that there was any possibility that the three objects we saw one night were meteors, I never would have mentioned the matter. Also, your letter to Major Jacks annunciates quite well the various points concerning our "sightings" whereby a moving object such as a meteor could quite well be ruled out.

I shall acquaint Corporal Woodward of this response to your report and suggest that he might also see fit to write you concerning the Air Force diagnosis.

My one final comment on the matter is that while I make no speculations as to what the objects we saw might be, I do feel most definitely that they were not meteors.

[Redacted location, Massachusetts]

Dear [Redacted]:

The Air Force has asked my opinion of their evaluation of the Bethel-Randolph sighting of 6 January 1965. I regret that it has taken so this long to get to this particular case.

As so frequently happens, I want more information before coming to any conclusions. While there is a strong similarity of this sighting to that of 30 July, nothing definite can be said until we have some idea of the distance. The objects were seen by two witnesses that in his opinion the objects passed between his and the distant hills.

If so, this would give an upper limit to the distance, and would prove that the objects were close by. On the other hand, one can be mistaken in judging such things as distance. I understand from a talk with someone on the phone, that there were other reports of the sighting, both by someone close in a car that was traveling this way by some distance and by someone else who saw it more or less at night and by someone in this case, then it seems the possibility of a rough fix on the object, a bit of information obviously of great importance.

I should like to ask whether you have made this calculation and, secondly, whether I might have access to these additional reports. I rather imagine that the additional reports were put in the log for analysis of material to the Air Force, as undoubtedly you have wished them to have as much information as possible.

I would agree on the basis of what limited information I have now that the sighting was not one of ordinary meteors, particularly the Quarantid. But as my opinion the bolide hypothesis is not entirely ruled out if the objects were at a great distance. Or in other words, I would agree that if we can establish that the objects were indeed close at hand, fine. If we can establish that the objects were at a great distance, then it is important to find an object that "landed in the next two yard" only to discover that the object is hundreds of miles away. Thus, I feel it is extremely important to establish, if at all possible, the distance of these objects by an objective method.

I hope that you will favor me with copies of the additional reports of this sighting and any other additional information which may throw some light on the matter. I understand that you are extremely anxious in this field, and while I cannot promise a definitive solution, I am certainly that from observation of facts and winnowing out whatever possible, we can reach a reasonable honest answer in the making of observations.

Sincerely you [Signature redacted]

Pathologist Views UFO

Dr. Richard S. Woodruff, Vermont State Pathologist, staff member of the University of Vermont College of Medicine, and a Vermont State Trooper were driving on Vermont Rt. 100 between Bethel and Randolph on 6 January 1965 when they saw 3 UFOs. In the Burlington Free Press, Dr. Woodruff was quoted:

"As we were driving along—suddenly—just above the treetops to our left, an object came rapidly into sight. It carried an elongated flight about the size of a football. This 'bogey' said: 'My God! Did you see that!' Just then the second came into view. It flew the same course as the first, to our right above the valley. Then came a third, quickly like the first two. Once we three looked at each other and I were spellbound. The UFOs appeared to be round, but they were travelling so fast we really couldn't say.

"I was not seeing things, and I am not too overly imaginative. And neither is this trooper." No ground or control was reported, nor was there any electromagnetic (EM) phenomena connected with the incident.

Tektites and the Cyrillid Shower
JOHN A. O'KEEFE, Goddard Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration

THE LAUNCHING of more than 50 artificial earth satellites in this three years since October 4, 1957, has given new impetus to the study of the many known instance of a natural satellites or rather a group of natural satellites. One to the earth. These were the Canadian fireball procession of February 9, 1913.

Many of that shower's phenomena are illuminated by the powerful and ingenious studies, especially of satellite recovery. That have been made in the last few years. The study of this shower also offers the possibility of explaining the origin of tektites, those strange and peculiar glass objects found in many parts of the world.

The Cyrillid shower passed the attention of astronomers when very hazy passed over Toronto on the night of 1913. According to Prof. G. A. Chant of the University of Toronto, "At about 9:05 on the evening in question there suddenly appeared in the northwestern sky a fiery red body which quickly rose larger as it came nearer, and with was then seen to be followed by a long trail... In the streaming of the trail behind, as well as in the color, both of the head and the tail, it resembled a cocker rocket, much higher up in the earth's atmosphere. On the contrary it was a meteor of perfectly brilliant path with peculiar, majestic, dignified

deliberation; and continuing in its course, without the least apparent sinking towards the earth, it moved on to the southwest where it simply disappeared in the distance. . . .

"Before the astonishment ceased by this first meteor had subsided, other meteors were seen emerging from the southwestern sky, coming from precisely the same point as the first one, and moving at the same deliberate pace. In two or three or four, with tails streaming behind, though not so long nor so bright as in the first case. They all traversed the same path and were headed for the same point in the southwestern sky. . . .

Several report that near the middle of the great procession was a fire large star brighter a tall, and that a double body was brought up the rear.

"Just as this looked, here vanishing.

As they passed over Toronto and in front of Ottawa, the Cyrillids caught the practiced eye of an artist, Felix Joubert, who wrote: "Nov. 04, 1913, and, he was then an amateur astronomer and friend of G. A. Chant. His painting is now in the University of Toronto."

Miss Catherine MacVicar Duncan, Thamesford, Ontario, who drew this sketch, reported hundreds of sparks in group 1, descries in 2 fewer in others. Of object, she said, "One big body floated along by himself..." - "The last group she noted to be much fainter than the others. Her location at Tavistock was about 150 miles from Toronto and slightly west of the center of the group of sightings appeared to move toward her light. The eyewitness sketches with this article are taken from the "Journal" of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.

or shortly afterwards, there was heard in many places a distinct rumbling sound, like distant thunder or like a carriage passing over gravel roadway or earth. In some cases three such sounds, following at short intervals, were heard while a number of people felt a shaking of the earth or of houses.

The observations at Toronto were supplemented by others from as far west in Canada as the vicinity of Regina, Saskatchewan. In the easterly direction, Grant obtained accounts of the same region from the newspapers and it was noted that the regions from which he had reports lay along an arc of a great circle with observers to the east of the circle lying in the south and those west of the circle seeing it in the east. (Grant part forward lies that the objects were natural meteors.)

In the following years, new data filled out the arc along which the Geminids were seen. Denning discovered some shipboard observations that were notable. The arc extended from Cape Race, Nfld., W. H. Pickard, into the South Atlantic off Cape San Roque, Brazil, N.W. H. Pickard.

[Diagram of circular orbit with labels: Circular Orbit, Toronto, Earth, Cape]

Obviously, the parabolic solution with respect to Cape San Roque will not work. And if we move the perihelion northward, then the meteors would have reached the earth's surface at some point along the arc.

From the physical point of view, the enormity of the belt along which the Geminids were seen is beyond the traditional concepts of meteors. It is a belt extending one another in similar orbits. If this was an ordinary meteor shower, the meteors would have to be very thin - about 100 miles across - and move very fast. Furthermore, the swarm would have to be so dense as to strike the earth so that its plane coincided

To the author for this research, A. D. Melcane lent his entire collection of positive and negative copies to extensive inquiries along the Chart trace from Minnesota to New York City. Triangles show position of the Chart trace, which was found to be a single article referring to the shower, with the third exception of some scientific observations of a widespread display.

Times negative results may be true areas of close weather on that night, and to two important conclusions. Comparing the data found to Chart triangles, we might say that the near a great circle, and they make it very unlikely that any substantial part of the Cyrillid shower survived for another chain of the earth.

The second conclusion gives us a significant clue to the origin of the Cyrillid display. It means that they had been moving around the earth as a group of bodies for very few revolutions, perhaps only one before the passage over Toronto on which they were observed. Suppose they had been instantaneously in orbit for many revolutions before they were seen. Because they would have died their mass and shape, the drag by the earth's atmosphere would be different for each of them and would slow some more than others. Several mathematical calculations would show this.

Since it is reasonable to suppose that the design coefficients differ from another by as much as a factor of two, some of the satellites would make a very small angle with the earth's orbit.

Part of the display seen by Col. W. R. Winter from Bermuda. As they moved across the sky, two large bodies broke into smaller parts, which developed into a trail and small sparks. The slowly traveling procession, which was positioned in Col. Winter's narrative, was broken up along its path.

The text appears to be discussing a meteor shower or astronomical event, with detailed analysis of its trajectory, observations, and potential origins.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

The most probable explanation, it appears, is that the Cyrillids were formed from a single body, which had and/or came into a considerable number of revolutions around its orbit. Eventually, perhaps as a result of lunar perturbations, the perhaps of the body came into the lower atmosphere, where it had been contracted, in the course which it had become familiar to all observers, into a number of major axis and eccentricity of the orbit.

In each successive perigee passage, the atmospheric heating became greater, not only because the successive passes were slightly lower in above all, because each revolution lasted longer than the previous one as the orbit's eccentricity diminished axially.

Except for the heating became very great, and the body began to melt. Dropping away from its surface. Some of these followed the main orbit out to space; others, turned either, were retarded more. In accordance with the theory of the dry radiation of the main body and preceded it on the next (final) path.

The critical point is that at which the body has momentum's total mass of air equal to its own mass. For a rapidly descending object, the point is reached at a much lower level for one moving nearly parallel to the earth's surface. At this lower level, the dearer air produces a strong drag, tending to slow the object and to break it up.

Formed from a typical meteorite arc such smaller (of the order of half a millimeter or less) than those from a re-entering artificial satellite. Small portions (fragments) have actually been recovered by E. L. Krinov in the U. S. R. (Sov. Astr. Tikhov, September 1959, page 617).

The larger drops have been observed (but not actually recovered) during the descent of Sputnik II, according to L. G. Jacchia.

Opik's theory also permits to make a rough calculation of the temperatures, rates of flow, thicknesses of the liquid layer, and other quantities, during the breakdown of the drops. The values found appear to be reasonable, agreeing with the physical characteristics of the

He spotted two groups of four or five bodies followed by a few scattered ones. Taking a total of about 15. He was most impressed by the slow, measured pace of the flight, estimating its duration as 15 to two minutes.

From Fenton Falls, 68 miles northeast of Toronto, Walter H. Stevenson reported seen a bright, white "star" in the first group. A big light was closely followed by a reddish glow, like the glare from a fire. A bright white "star" at a minimum to be nearly as brilliant as the planet Venus, was seen by several observers. They tracked the spectacle. The objects had "about the angular speed of a bright star" and placed ten bright fragments "by estimation" three minutes.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Seventy-five miles northeast of Toronto, at Centreton, John T. Ormiston compared the length of the meteor with the trees 200 yards in front of him. The woods subtended an angle of about 55 degrees, and by comparison the longest meteor was some 25 degrees.

Standards have found that only a few minutes are required to reduce ferrous oxide from terrestrial material, say by meteoritic impact. They have also noted that the almost complete lack of a common type of terrestrial magnetite suggests that the meteor was a boring, time of at least a few minutes. The lack of water points in the same direction.

On the other hand, W. Bauer has recently pure silica that appear in tektites heating test. This the down the heating rate of tektites is roughly 5 to 15 miles, which is also how long the Cyrillids were hot.

It is even possible to form an idea of the pressure during pyroxylic driving tektite formation, for they contain bubbles in which the pressure is less than a thousandths of an atmosphere.

The association of tektites with showers of the Cyrillids type is thus supported by evidence from the size and form of tektites, their temperature of fusion, the duration of heating, and possibly the presence of water. And the spotty distribution of known tektites over the earth's surface is consistent with this of the Cyrillids type of meteor shower.

By contrast, theories of the origin of tektites from the moon or from terrestrial sources have serious trouble in the conversion of ferns to ferrous oxide or in the production of large drops in the relatively steep descent of a meteorite. It relates an interesting problem of a substantial chunk of glass in the brief time of fall.

On the whole, I feel that the evidence strongly supports the idea that tektites form in showers such as the Cyrillids, and the ultimate origin is of the body that emitted this shower is of great interest. Perhaps it could reach here as a throw from the moon by meteoritic impact. At the end of a lunar tektite origin was suggested in this magazine by J. H. Nininger 18 years ago (February, 1945, page 125).

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois 60201

Dear Dr. Hynek:

I am in receipt of your letter of 15 April 1965 requesting additional information concerning the Bethel-Randolph sighting on 1 January 1965. I regret to inform you that very little information has been collected. That information which has been collected is enclosed. The form of letters and questionnaires called to our investigation. Unfortunately NICAP does not have a subcommittee in Vermont and our normally somewhat similar approaches would only in investigative work where direct on-the-spot interviewing and investigation is convenient for us. In this investigation we have tried to obtain further information such as you asked for but have had no response. I am sure you are aware of this kind of problem.

This is one of the many UFO reports that are "border-line" cases. As you know an outline of facts tending to negate the possibility of other than ordinary and individual UFO reports kept to NICAP and BLUEBOOK. We pointed out that these facts in themselves did not prove that the objects were not questionable. Air Force evaluation was at least negative. We note that the New England questionnaire was not returned. It is interesting to note that no other reports of this phenomenon and that the [redacted] Institute received no reports of a similar nature. The witnesses claim the objects passed in-front of hills not over four miles away and all witnesses were close. This suggests (especially in [redacted]'s correct in his observational) that this specific incident was unique. I will enclose the names and addresses of the witnesses. Perhaps you can have a response from them.

Enclosed is information concerning our subcommittees and a letter to our first Air Force Liaison, Maj. [redacted] who once worked with you at Harvard Observatory. Our address, Walt Webb, once worked for you and has an special highly regarded UFO Investigator concerning the sighting by the Federal Law Enforcement Agency. All the background is to the best of my knowledge. Dr. Pilot (Mil. Celestial) who investigated this report. He is presently with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. All this was kept to you in your work with the USAF.

I look forward to Jacques Vallee's "Anatomy of a
