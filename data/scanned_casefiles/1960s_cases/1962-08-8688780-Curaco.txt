PK. 20.23 pm.

Dear Gentlemen,

On the evening of 16 f august 1962 we saw a clear light in the sky. It was going from west to East. This is not exact for we had not a compass. We thought that it was a heavenly body, but after we went to look it was the sky, and then we got the thought that it was an object of mysterious origin cause while we got this thought we scard so much after: we have to write this to the men of Cape command and so here you see our letter.

We would like if you give being more about this. There is one possibility more that it. on a given moment the light point out slowly, we had seen it for about 2 minutes.
