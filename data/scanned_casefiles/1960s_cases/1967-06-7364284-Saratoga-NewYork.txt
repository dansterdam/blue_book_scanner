UFOs Reported Over County
Two Boys, Woman, Man See Unidentified Flying Objects

By NANCY McKEOWN

Three separate sightings of unidentified flying objects Fri-day night in the Saratoga Springs area have been reported.

Two local boys, camping in their backyard, spotted a huge cluster of lights which streaked across the sky.

Two Greenfield women sitting on their front porch reported seeing two large glowing, disk-shaped orange objects, which "Separate, while fore shooting off in opposite directions."

THE THIRD REPORT came from a Vermont man who said that as he was driving on a lonely road near Lake George, his car engine suddenly went dead, he stopped, and he saw a huge bullet-shaped object rise from behind the trees.

He said the object kept rising steadily upward until it was out of sight.

The description of the sighted objects and the manner in which they reportedly behaved are distinctly different in each case.

A spokesman for the Saratoga Springs Radar Station said no UFO reports had been received by the station's radar had no tracked any unidentifiable objects.

THOMAS MERCER, 121 Newton Ave., and Frederick Spear, Webster St., who will be juniors at Saratoga High School next year, had decided Friday to spend the night in Spear's backyard observing the stars.

Both boys, who have been active in the high school science club said that since the night was particularly clear, they set up a camera to photograph the heavens.

At 12:30 a.m., the boys said, the negatives from one camera spotted the huge cluster of lights which streaked across the sky in about 50 seconds.

ON THE REPORT which the two boys sent to the Air Force Project Blue Book at Patterson Air Force Base and to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, the altitude of the lights is stated as being lower than the normal altitude of a jet plane.

According to Mercer, the lights pulsed but did not blink. The boys said they could not tell whether or not the lights were mounted on a solid object, but added that they moved in close formation.

Both youths attempted to photograph the phenomenon.

THE NEGATIVES from one camera were blank. Several spots appeared on the negatives from the other camera.

THE TWO GREENFIELD women who said they spotted two orange disks said the objects were quite a distance apart. For several minutes, they said, the objects rose close to each other and then slowly go off in different directions.

One of the disks reportedly passed in front of the moon.

The included prints are of the same negative, but at different exposures to bring out the greatest detail possible. You will note that what we described as lights against the night sky appear as just the opposite. We can offer no reason for this. It is clear this effect was caused by the UFO as star in the photo appears as it should have. As of now we do not know if the other camera recorded the same phenomenon. When this information is available we will forward it on request.

UFO Observation, June 23, 1967

Saratoga Springs, New York 12866

1. Reference your recent observation and subsequent photographs of an unidentified flying object. It was mentioned in the correspondence that additional photographs were exposed. If these photographs provide more details of the objects, our photographic analysis would appreciate the opportunity to review them (The original negatives would be helpful). The two photographs you sent show very little detail and a detailed photographic analysis will be difficult. Request you complete the enclosed photograph data sheet and return it in the envelope provided.

2. Upon completion of analysis, we will return your photographs with our findings.
