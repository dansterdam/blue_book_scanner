10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Merint rpt of celestial phenomena appearing in the East coming up from the horizon. Brilliant white glow, circular in shape. Obj then descended to 30 dgr elevation & appeared to make a ragged circular course leaving huge white vapor trails. Disappeared to the South on incline of 50 dgr at great speed.

11. COMMENTS
Missile launch schedule did not have launch at this time; however, this rpt does not contain all launches. Sighting made im Louisiana in direction of Elgin, Patrick and Cape Canaveral. Since obj sighted was characteristic of a missile launch observation, the case is evaluated as 'probable missile'.
