The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO with the label "Four darker areas" and "Triangles". The text in the document describes the sighting of an unidentified object on the evening of April 22 that the observer could not identify as a UFO. The observer describes the object as very bright and close together, and includes a diagram of the object they witnessed.

Barksdale AFB, La.
Dear Sir:
I wish to report an object I sighted in the evening of April 22, but can not identify (a UFO). I would very much appreciate an investigation or identification is possible.
I sited the object on the evening of April 22, about 7:15 pm, coming from the southwest and going to the northeast, after sunset. I was armed with 7-power binoculars from my automobile. I could not discern any details as the object seemed to be covered by some sort of casing or covering which did not allow me to see any structural details. It was bright to the extent that it reflected or seemed to light up the countryside. I am employed at the Air Force Missile Site 585-2-5, and I observed the object from the southwest on the range road as I was returning to the base after completing my tour of duty about 7:15 pm (5:15 pm CST). It was bright to the extent that it seemed brighter than a bright star or planet and was much closer together! Using my telescope I saw this very well. Four darker areas and three triangulars.
Note:
When viewing an object through a telescope, it is quite difficult to discern fine details. This helps explain why I could not see any distinct details on the object.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing only text.

The object did not appear to be tilted at any angle, but rather parallel to the ground. The whole object seemed to emit a bluish-yellow glow, brighter than the rest of the scene. It was larger than the four triangles in the center, which were themselves larger than the two brighter "spots" which seemed to be emitting a pale glow.
The object seemed to be only several feet above the ground. The observer reports that it hovered about ten minutes, then moved off rapidly. The object seemed to reassure itself to only move upward at the last. The previously mentioned moving cloud layer did it, but those on the nights afterwards did not.
If it was a natural object, like a fantastic cloud, it should have been recognizable as such. However, it did not seem to be anything in that class. The observer says he knows the object, I am saying that they are not mistaken. I have been seeing a telescope for over ten years, and I know both by day and night what's normal and what's not. I do not think this was just some ordinary electrical condition in the atmosphere, because things like that are much more everyday and obvious, this was not. Nor would it have been some trick of the stars, because the border of the night sky, as seen from my position, would not have been changed.
The object seemed to emit an intense light, enough to make one's eyes blink-I could not look at it for very long. There was also the anti-sugar crowd can think up do not that think that this same object may have also been some sort of flying craft, rather than just a natural phenomenon. The way it moved and the bright light it gave off seems evidence that it was some kind of powered vehicle. However, I cannot be certain of this, as I do not have any special knowledge in this area. I am merely describing what I saw that night to the best of my ability.

There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a typed text with some redactions.

Automobile headlight reflections are, in the brightest, for the same reason, dont know why, it was likly normal for some small child, thing long that was strange, a normal 50 shaped not gas or silicon as this was.
Now, can you tell me was it was or could it, have you have no explanation of the UFO, adviseing me of this will as well be apprecated.

the way and was as I described it.

Yours,
