Barksdale AFB, La.

Dear Sir:

I wish to report an object I sighted in the evening sky and can not identify (a UFO). I would very much appreciate a reply identifying it (if identification is possible).

I sighted the object on the evening of April 22. I was up on the dormitory roof hoping to catch the planet Mercury after sunset. I was armed with 7-power binoculars and an 80-power, three inch, reflecting telescope. A cloud covering had managed to move in enough to hide Mercury from view. But I notice a very bright light in the Southwestern skys (about W-320-S, 10Â° up from the horizon at 9:10 pm CST). It was brighter than the brightest star Sirius. Using my binoculars, I saw that it was not one light, but two very close together! Using my telescope I saw this:

Note:
When viewing an object through a telescope, it is naturally turned upside down. Although I viewed it with the small "light" on top, I drew it turned over for your convenience.

The object did not appear to be tilted at any angle. A line drawn through the two large "lights" would have been parallel to the ground. The whole object was lighted as if from reflected sunlight (slightly yellow) except for the four trimmings in the center, which were slightly darker than the rest, and the two large and the third smaller "lights" which seemed to be self-luminous, brighter than the rest of the object and about the color of a car or wet car headlights (a yellowish color, but more yellow than the rest of the object). The object seemed to have no motion of its own. It seemed to only move by the earth rotating under it (the same way the sun and stars move). I watched it with just my unaided eye and binoculars for 10-15 min. And with the telescope for only 1-2 min. until the previously mentioned moving cloud layer hit it from view.

If it was a natural object, like a fantastically close double star, planet, comet, etc., it should have returned to approximately the same place at approximately the same time the next nights. For several nights since, I have checked the skies for its return; it has not.

I am a junior at the Louisiana Polytechnic Institute, on who's dormitory I saw the object. I am majoring in chemistry, but astronomy and astronautics are two of my hobbies. I have been using my telescope for over ten years, so I know that the object was not a double image nor out of focus or something (besides, seeing the two brighter lights in my binocular varieties that there was at least two lights). Also, it could not have been a double star, because my telescope cannot magnify a star that much unless the star was impossibly close. It could not have been the bright planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn, because I saw Mercury a few nights before, and it was much closer to the sun and less bright. It could not have been a satellite, because two planets get before the sun does. (For could it have been Mars or Jupiter, because dark areas not rise in the East until after 11:00 pm and Jupiter is only about 1/50 up from the eastern horizon around 7:00 pm. Since it did not move, it could not have been a satellite unless it was the type that stays in one place over the earth, but then it would have been on the nights afterward. You could say that it was an airplane and by flying straight towards me, I would be unable to see any wings. But I would have (and I did not) see the predominant red and green flashing wingtips. Comets, meteors, fireballs, swamp gas, electrical, astronomical causes, balls of static electricity, spots before my eyes, flying saucer-boats, and what ever else the anti-saucer groups can think up do not look anything like my object. Meteors, fireballs, etc. do not last for 10-15 min., nor do they stand still and last the earth roll like this did. I am sure since it was not

automobile headlight reflections off air layers, because
of its brightness, nor for the same reason, do I think
it was light rather than off a small cloud. Weather balloons are generally "V" shaped not egg or ellipse shaped
as this was.

Now, can you tell me what it was or could logically have
been? If you have no explanation of the UFO, a letter
advising me of this will as well be accepted.

the [rest of text redacted] all the above and preceding is
true and was as I described it.
