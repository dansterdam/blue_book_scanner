As he was driving along the highway about 50 MPH, he described the object as large, round, silent, hovering, about 250 feet in diameter, and about 100 feet above the ground. It was observed for about 3-4 minutes. Lights were stationary. As the UFO moved away, it is stated a bright light seemed to move towards the object and the object then went out of sight. All this time he co-operated with the Air Force and they told him of being blind since birth for about 40 minutes. He said that the whites of his eyes had turned red. Mr. Parson Ridge, was supporting from an "Arc welder" type burn. This indication said his eyes were sighted for about 20 seconds and at the time the wind was about 1/2 mile away.

FLYING SAUCER FROM MARS DISCOVERED
An on-the-spot Institute Investigation recently verified the existence of a "Flying Saucer From Mars," which has accounted for many UFO sightings in the Pittsburgh area. The object is a Citabria Champion advertising plane flown by Fred Eller, Connellsville Airport, and bears the above quoted inscription with the qualification "may" in small letters after "Mars." Mr. Eller owns AAA Sky Ads, Inc.
The wingspan of the Citabria ("airbadie" spelled backwards) is 36-1/2 feet. It usually flies at an altitude of about 1,000 feet, around 70 mph, and can stay aloft over five hours. Mounted below the wings is a framework of struts to which are soldered 7 rows of 36 GM-1 bulbs, the size of a flashlight bulb. A heavy tape with holes punched in it is laid out in a certain sequence across the bulbs, to shield light up in a certain sequence, to make the passage move across the lights. An air siren mounted below the plane is sometimes used to attract attention.
In a strong heading, at an airspeed of 30 mph, the Citabria can appear to be standing still. Seen on edge, its lights, moving from one side to another, can give the appearance of a flickering object with a row of lights around the rim. The engine of the plane is inaudible at a distance from which the moving lights can be easily seen; thus, many people report seeing a silent, disc-shaped object with rotating rim-covered lights. When the plane is flying directly toward or away from the observer, especially in a misty atmosphere, its appearance can be quite eerie. It can, as several reports have stated, definitely not resemble any conventional aircraft.
