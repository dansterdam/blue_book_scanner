May 31, 1968

Dear Sirs:

I wrote a letter to the John F. Kennedy Space Center, NASA about a Unidentified Flying Object I saw on the early morning of March 17 about 1 to 3 A.M. when I was helping my boss take a ride called the Flying Booster. It is a ride from a Carnival. The U.F.O. was going W. est. It was a real large glowing oval object. It was as large as a regular classroom in school. Could you send me some information leading to this incident, and could send me some photographs of some of your aircraft.

Please so I can show

Thank
