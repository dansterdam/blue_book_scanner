Gives Heliport
24-Hour Capability

By Jeff Hutchinson

A copter is poised to give 24-hour emergency medical service over Norfolk and surrounding areas. It will be based at Norfolk International Airport and will be staffed by a specially trained crew.

[The rest of the right column text is partially illegible, but appears to discuss details about the helicopter service and its capabilities.]

On the right side of the document, there appears to be additional text about the heliport service, but parts of it are difficult to read completely.

Subject - Incident that occurred on security border

At approx 12:15 hrs when for 1 hr while making security rounds near transmitter building, a vehicle a white, intense, flood light shining down on transmitter to off, some 200 yds distant. Thought that someone had interfered a ghost light that deep on - now if night to be around the fifty and the light for me to light a white vehicle to the sky. The vehicle was put out for a better look. When I stopped and got out the flood light went out and it was gone quickly on with its own flight off west. Quite while all was going up the small white glowing area was starting out and the shift to close despite not to place down to little, and did not come working and passing quite. I doubt some days you all it might as it was clearly and now all to some to a ship for glint a possible and then it spoke a circle away fast and slipped, its dim then some and slipped off about another minute. of these seemed slight of life. Then it moved off and disappeared. Took some a few glance 5 to 10 secs. The time it disappeared, went all.

STATEMENT OF

On or about 1935, 10 January 1969 my wife and I were leaving our house to go to the shopping center in Portsmouth, Virginia. I happened to glance up at the sky noting that it was a very clear night and that all the stars were fairly visible. As I looked in the general direction of the 800° tower, I noticed a large bright white light. I said to my wife what the hell is that, thinking at first that some one might have put a white light in the top of the Tower. However, as we drove down to the Gate of the station I noticed that it was not in the same area as the Tower and that all lights were still extinguished on Tower #6.

About the best description that I can derive of what I say, was in comparison to a large spotter light of the type used on aircraft when they approach an international airport, however, this particular light could not have been on a conventional-type aircraft, unless it was a helicopter, because it remained stationary and did not move in any direction. My wife and I proceeded to the shopping center and when I returned, I made a point to look for this same light. It was no longer anywhere in sight. The time of my second observation was about 2120, 10 January 1969. I reported my UFO sighting to the station duty officer who in turned notified the Officer in Charge, Naval Radio Station (T), Driver, Virginia.

Friday 10 Jan 1969

Subject: Unidentified lights

This is to clarify that on about 1930 hours on this date at new rod str(?) drive in noticed that the scene lights were on south park here out. But what appeared to be the evening star seemed to be at top of said mile. Rept after checking with sgt. Kinnett and being informed that the signal lights were known to be out I took for granted that what I thought was a star could have been a light being temp cold until scene lights could be manned and some time later as further attention on this apply side notes.

When you closer ask me if I had seen said light I told him that I had but the light was not visible at this time. The matter was passed to the base etc attention report 20 days.
