White light with intensity 3 times magnitude of brightest stars appeared in western sky. Appeared to be a star but with a cyclic varying intensity.

11. COMMENTS
Several witnesses reported seeing a strange light at different times over a period of several days. Investigating officer at Patrick AFB went alert in B-47 and subsequently on 11 Mar reported by witnesses, definitely determined that light was on a jet airliner. Subsequent info received from the FAA reveals that a number of different typed of anti-collision lights are being installed on civil a/c for experiment purposes. Characteristics of lights are now reported by witnesses reporting UFO. Is established that object was anti-collision lights.

MAY 2 1961

Dear Major Coleman:

Your letter dated April 7, 1961, regarding sighting of white light rotating beacons on aircraft has been forwarded to this office for reply.

Approved anti-collision lights required for night flight on aircraft having a maximum gross weight of more than 12,500 pounds and used on many lighter aircraft are now readable beacons.

Special Civil Air Regulation SR-392-8 which is scheduled to terminate February 25, 1962, provides for limited experimental use of types of lighting systems which do not comply with the relevant specifications considered in the CARS.

A number of different types of lights are being evaluated by the Federal Aviation Agency, Bureau of Research and Developments and various manufacturers and manufacturers. The majority of these lights are of the probe condenser discharge type which produce a brilliant blue-white light. One type of investigation, conducted by a leading manufacturer, using white and red and a "boosting" white salt light. The periodic discharge flag or the "boosting" effect may not be distinguishable from a white rotating beacon. Some impression that white rotating beacons have been observed.

Since approvals of experimental operation in accordance with SR-392-8 are limited in the field, the number and types of lights presently in operation are not readily available.

Maintaining a current list of aircraft with experimental lighting would be impractical as it is subject to frequent changes.

If we may be of additional assistance, please advise.

Sincerely,
Original Signed by

2 October 1961

Dear Donald:

Enclosed you will find the TWX's dealing with the Florida problem. These messages are self-explanatory, so I will launch into my particular phase of this operation.

On the 29th of April I took off from Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia in a T-33 (single engine jet) just after noon time. I was flying an instrument flight rules clearance via high altitude jet airway to Key West Naval Air Station at an assigned altitude of 29,000 feet. My route took me across Alma (Georgia), Jacksonville (Florida), Daytona Beach (Florida), Vero Beach (Florida), Palm Beach (Florida), Miami and Key West. On takeoff from Atlanta we passed through a broken layer of strato cumulus breaking out on top at about 9,000 feet. As we approached Jacksonville all clouds below us became non-existent. South of Jacksonville I could see across the state to the Gulf of Mexico. I had been briefed on a front (cold) approaching the state from over the Gulf. I could see the leading edge of the front on the bare edge of the western horizon far out over the Gulf. Now, I had been aware of two reports from the Port Pierce, Florida area. These reports were telephonic to Patrick Air Force Base and the Eglin Air Force Base. So, I made a point to be especially watchful for any unusual visual sightings. Just as we were passing over the Port Pierce area with the aircraft in low altitude turbulence of the short wave type... that is, like riding in a car over a washboard road. This surprised me because I know that a jet stream did not exist over Florida at this time and that the wind shear and component was not sufficient to produce turbulence of any degree. The wind at my altitude was a nominal 70 knots from 280 degrees. I had remembered that one of the telephonic reports stipulated turbulence in connection with one of the sightings. I began searching for an answer. Being a Floridian I recalled that much fires were not uncommon in the Everglades. The glades lay from the twelve-thirty to four o'clock position to the aircraft. I looked over the glades closely and immediately noted a very large much fire. Now, as typical with a cold front situation the surface wind was blowing from the east pushing the smoke and heat toward the West Coast of Florida. This relatively warm air naturally was lifting in the surrounding cool air. When the continuing warm air rose rapidly to the higher altitudes it ran into the reversed upper winds (high altitude westerly). In the process of being lifted the smoke was filtered and cleared, yet the air remained relatively heated. It was moved directly across our course, thereby causing turbulence.


- page 7 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Nothing unusual occurred during the remainder of the leg into Key West. We penetrated and landed. I refueled at Key West and filed another instrument flight rules clearance. This time my destination was Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in South Carolina. My route was via west of the other with a change of course at Jacksonville taking me over the Atlantic direct to Charleston, S. C., thence direct to Myrtle Beach. I flew this route at an altitude of 20,000 feet.

After watching altitude as we approached the mainland of Florida inbound to Miami, I noticed that the squall line associated with the coming cold front was now lying parallel to the Florida West Coast, almost at the shoreline vertically. It was tight squall line with a great deal of weather activity (high winds at the surface, lightning, etc.) The tops of the highest thunderheads reached to probably 38,000 feet. But the base again like too was about 24,000 feet. Just beyond Miami I noticed some unusual bright blobs of light. I must set the stage very carefully... the Sun was setting... for those at my altitude and those on the Sun was still light. I was able to quickly identify the aircraft since I had seen a Strategic Air Command tanker-bomber revealing operation before. This one was more particular due to the reflection of the Sun on the aircraft and the condensation trails the aircraft were making...all this against the relatively dark background of the continuous squall line.

Nothing else of an unusual nature occurred during the remainder of the leg into Myrtle Beach.

Now...after you have read the enclosed TWX's, particularly message # USAIAS WTG-31-3-5...and soon as I saw this message, I called the Federal Aviation Agency to inquire if a sewer type anti-collision beacon was being used. (The standard beacon is rotating sodium (red) light.) They said they would check into it. I was later informed that many were being used as the experiment was being conducted from the Naval Air Test Center. They added that several jet-liners were using the light as well as some turbo-prop aircraft. (I had seen this type of light on two or three aircraft flying out of Washington National.)

You can imagine what this white type strobe intensity beacon would look like at night range. You would get the same effect, except more so, as watching Venus or Jupiter rising or setting through a hazy atmosphere.

Well that is about it. I purposely made this a bit detailed for I didn't want to slight the circumstances surrounding the sightings. But the Florida case was an example of sightings by witnesses on the ground and in the air and included airline pilot veterans who are so often mistakenly identified as experts on aerial phenomena.

7 April 1961

Dear Mr. Planck:

Per telephone conversation with you on April 5th, I am enclosing the message concerning rotating white light beacons on board civil aircraft enroute to Miami. I have also enclosed a couple of type of UFO reports we have received to give you an idea of the type of report we get on this subject. We have other messages on UFO sightings in this area during the period in question, from newspapers and radio stations located on the lower west coast of Florida.

In noticing departing traffic out of Washington National Airport with aircraft rotating white rotating beacons, I have some justification including the fact that these lights are in use in our next Department of Defense Fact Sheet releases on the subject of UFOs. Apparently these white beacons are very well, and I would agree from what I have seen aboard some aircraft. Other colors of the spectrum would help me, as seen by some observers, due to distant range filtration of the source light through the atmosphere.

Any information you can furnish on this subject, vis-a-vis type of light, number in use, etc., will be appreciated.

Sincerely,
WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.

As soon as I replied to the queries and explained what the problem was, we had no more reports... and the lights on the aircraft were continued in use.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance on this. It was nice seeing you the other day. How about arranging to come in for lunch one day so we can talk in a more relaxed atmosphere?

As ever,

The following is an example of UFO sightings involving veteran pilots: a recent flurry of UFO reports from the Lower East Coast area of Florida came in from many observers, including airline and military pilots. Some pilots reported moderate turbulence in clear air as well as the sighting of "bobbing, oscillating bright, white light" that sometimes changed color. During the period the Air Force UFO Project Officer was piloting a jet airliner in that vicinity enroute to Key West from Robbins Air Force Base, Georgia. He was flying at 29,000 feet when he saw into clear air turbulence. He, too, was puzzled for the moment because he knew the wind shear at the altitude was not sufficient to cause turbulence and there was no jet stream. On looking around for a possible explanation, he noticed a large amuck fine burning in the Everglades. Due to surface winds being opposite that of high altitude winds (normal to a cold pre-frontal condition) the heated air was lifted by convection action westward until it came under the influence of the prevailing high altitude westerlies. These winds moved the relatively warm air into the flight path of the jet, thereby causing turbulence.

Shortly after this, a B-57 jet bomber was scrambled from Patrick Air Force Base to intercept a reported "flying saucer." The B-57 pilot was vectored toward the "target" and when within 50 miles of the target he could see the "bobbing, oscillating, bright, white lights." He located it through a pair of poor man's binoculars and identified it as a civil jet airliner inbound to Miami International Airport. Shortly thereafter he identified another similar aircraft. Both of these sightings were reported as UFOs by many people, including pilots.

Query to the Federal Aviation Agency confirmed that some civil jet airliners were using a strobe-type light of high intensity mounted one above the other, flashing alternately. When this type of light is viewed at almost any angle through relatively thick atmosphere, it appears to be much larger than it really is and "shows" different color (due to possible effects of atmosphere and light).

Now, for the "gloring, circular objects." We "scrambled" a B-57 jet bomber (light) after one of the lights when we acquired an object on our radar at the Air Force Missile Test Center (Cape Canaveral). This object on the radar coincided with visual reports of a UFO seen from the ground. The B-57 made visual contact with the object at 25,000 feet, fifty miles distant. As he approached closer to the "object" the pilot was able to see the "gloring, circular light."

Others were many other describing) through binoculars. It was a civil airliner inbound to Miami and the cause of the circular light was a strange beacon of the white type with intensity. The further you were away from the light, thereby adding atmospheric density, the larger it appeared and gradually changed color (spectrum filtration through the atmosphere at slant angle). While the B-57 was airborne, another "flying saucer" was reported. The B-57 gave chase and found it to be another civil airliner with a white, strobe type rotating anti-collision beacon, also inbound to Miami. This information was provided news media, surprisingly with no facts, and we have had no further reports from that area.

Please do not misinterpret the above report as the answer to all. It is not, as you will see from the attached fact sheet.

I hope this information and the attached is helpful. Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

As the UFO Project Officer for the Air Force (recently assigned)
I would like to point up a recent case involving numerous sightings by
new people, including airline pilots, military personnel, news media
representatives and others. A couple of weeks ago we began getting
numerous reports of "glowing, circular objects" high in the sky over
the lower West coast of Florida. During the peak of these observations
I, as a jet pilot, was flying over that section of Florida. I was
flying at an altitude of 29,000 feet enroute from Atlanta to Key West.
In a jet fighter, I ran into clean turbulence over the Fort Pierce,
Florida, area. Now, this phenomena is not too uncommon; however, the
wind shear component at my altitude was nowhere near that required
to produce turbulence. There was no jet stream in the area as the
wind at my altitude was approximately 70 knots and about 90 degrees to
my course out of the West. I immediately began to look around. I saw
a small dark fin in the Everglades. The murky and low 160 degrees
opposite the high altitude winds. So the relatively heated patch or
air above the wet Everglades westward, and its rose (convection)
in the relatively cool surrounding air, it ran into the cooler high
altitude westerlies which then moved the warm air into my flight path
causing the turbulence. This, then, explains the turbulence reported
by some aircrews.
