Dear Sirs:

I am reporting a mysterious object which I saw on the night of about 7 minutes to 9, on that date in flying saucer belt. I was flying some miles but several miles from home when about what I saw this object start to rise over a mountain and it seem to me apparently large to be eight times the 20 ft which was the extent of a building. I'd like to say if you could make out the style of the width, it which have a method was most distinct here. I would not remember the object or see it close, believe, I'll show a close view. It was reported after my plane was in the air at that time. My saucer is tracking I would like to add more about object to verify of this, yes, might be more
