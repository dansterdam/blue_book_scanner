Witness reporting sighting approximately had been watching obj for 30 min prior to calling and obj was still in view. Witness said only major fact he was looking toward 3rd obj, which is to S of him, and obj apparently remained in same general area. It is possible that, since obj did not disappear, it was reflection of unidentified light source or of a high haze layer.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Obj slightly brighter than star/redish glitter observed on SW horizon. No motion. In sight 10 min. Stayed in same location.

11. COMMENTS Analyst called 1 of witnesses on same day, said time of sighting was in fact just after 2200. Obj observed has characteristics of a light source when seen close to horizon. Last magnitude star in Ursa was just above horizon in position reported for obj. This star's magnitude is only plus 1.3, but being close to horizon will make it appear brighter and larger than it would if it were if it were higher.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Light flashing or flickering appearing and disappearing in same location. Brighter than star, in W. No elevation.

11. COMMENTS: Witness stated that objt had been viewed for 15 min and was still in view at end of interview. Plev of objt was not reported, and as attempt was made to contact witnesses w/negative results. Description is characteristic of a light which is situated fairly close to horizon. Check indicates that Jupiter was close to western horizon at time of sighting. However, 1st magnitude star Altair was also in W slightly higher than Jupiter. Therefore, light could have been 1 of 2.

COMMANDER
Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio

Aug. 15, 1961

Dear Sir:

May I pardon this intrusion upon your time, as goodness knows, you are probably a very busy man. However, last nite I, my wife and two friends witnessed a phenomenon which I cannot explain, I called the OD at the base, he had no explanation for it and suggested I write to you, to which I am anxiously waiting an answer. May I also state that I spent 1 yrs. in the Naval Air Corp. and was the first to hold tongue in cheek, at reading of some sightings reported by different people in different parts of the country. So Sir, please do not hold this letter in the light of a crank, or prankish letter.

At 10:50 sharp last nite, after viewing our Echo Satellite, and were in the back yard talking, my wife noticed a red lite coming from a southerly direction. I immediately explained that it probably was an aircraft making its way into the traffic pattern. However, it proceeded straight across the sky in a Northern direction, and about 3/4 the way across the sky, I heard sharply eastward, without changing speed, without deceleration, and what made this item even more strange, was there was absolutely no sound.

If it was as high as the Echo satellite, then it must have been going at least 30,000 to 40,000 miles per hr, as it moved swiftly across the sky. If it was a low flying object, why was it noiseless. If it was in the realm of a U-2 plane, which I understand, has terrific gliding powers, and can cut its engines, and glide for tremendous distances, then why was the very bright light, red in color, shining at the same density, the whole path.

I could understand if the red light was blinking off and on as usual, or I could understand if we saw other navigational lights, however, this was not the case, the light was of the same intensity the whole flight. I also assumed that even if it were a plane of the U-2 type, that some noise would be heard, as we would have probably have heard the tremendous air pressures hitting the skin, if the plane was low. If it was at an altitude of say 60,000 ft., then the light that shone would have been of tremendous size, as we know it, changing direction, without any decrease, at a sharp right angle. So to recap, it moved in a South to North direction, directly overhead, veered sharply to the East, the red light did not change in density, there was absolutely no sound at all. It moved across the sky approximately 3 to 4 minutes as fast as the Echo satellite.

I did not intend to over-whelm you with a lengthy letter, but would appreciate an answer when you have time.

Very truly Yours,
Dayton 29, Ohio

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Bright light, like a star. Disappeared by fading out. Changed course.

11. COMMENTS: Most logical conclusion as to identity of obj is that it was a high-flying a/c. Jet a/c white light under fuselage which is only 1 evident when the a/c are at high altitudes. Wind direction and altitude can be cause for absence of sound. Due to changing angle of observation and increasing distance, light could appear to snap out. Probably a/c.
