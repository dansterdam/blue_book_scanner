10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Circular, size of nickel at arms length. White with red crest near top. NW 22 approx 16Â° above horizon at appearance and was watched for over an hour but was not observed to disappear. Slight left and right movement.

11. COMMENTS
Obj't of this sighting was probably planet Venus with associated effects of atmospheric refraction. The direction of the planet and UFO at time of sighting are coincident. Venus at time of sighting was just setting and effects of atmospheric refraction, distortion, discoloration and apparent motion were at maximum magnitude of -4.3. Fact that last sighting occurred just as planet set substantiates this conclusion.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Probably Astronomical Venus
