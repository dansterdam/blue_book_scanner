UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Dayton, Ohio
Date: 18 May 1960   Hour (E): 2025

WX Clear, 7 mi vis, surf winds SE at 4 knots

Description: White light, size of saucer, would move when on, then appeared to remain stationary when off; light apparently turned on and off four or five times before it disappeared, in sight for 5 to 7 minutes, was first and last seen in the Southeast.

Direction of Motion: Northwest

Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219)   Ruled out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.)   Ruled out

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-481)   None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.)   Ruled out

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.:   Poss Aircraft

Other:

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probably unreliable due to young age of 12.

Analysis and Conclusions: Although the source states that the light apparently remained off for about 1 minute, this is considered to be exaggerated somewhat. Patterson Field had two acft in the area at the time, a T-33 and a C-46. The C-46 would be the most logical explanation. Also, there is a small airport in the city of Dayton, and an acft from it could have been in the air at the time. It is evident that the young lady who reported has read about xnmt so-called flying saucers, as she gave the size as that of a saucer. It is quite probable that the light was on an acft, and the stories published about UFOIS xnxt coupled with a young mind accounted for the report.
