I believe it was not a gas, slithion, atmospheric disturbance for nothing like that would go to horizon to horizon, and I am sure positive that it was some kind of flying vehicle I can promise you that. It moved at a fantastic speed so fast that I can't estimate.

P.S. Thank you for helping me be one of testimony. I hope that you have reported this sighting, and you have taken the time to run research.

Flying Saucers Just Cap

MOSCOW (UPI) — Flying saucers are just a capitalist sensations which never fail:
Flying saucers, the Soviet press says, are a monster and the abominable snowman's said science columnist V. Kosovorotykh in the Daily Moskovskii Komsomol-

When it becomes necessary to distract the readers from tough problems, Western leaders have three ready

lets.

"T-3 more interesting to read of mysterious happenings from Venus than think of

tomorrow's pay freeze, price rise or unemployment."

AS PROOF of this capitalist plot, he said saucer "sightings" increased during American election years and during the Korean and Vietnam wars.

Lyudberg's article was the latest salvo in a running bat-

World's First UFO Murder

by AL KATZMAN

For Australian rancher Derek Hayden and his wife Melissa, death came swiftly and with an eerie high-pitched whine out of the sky, "a flying saucer killed them," Territorial Policeman Arthur White said flatly when interviewed last week by MIDNIGHT, "We have the evidence to prove it."

The bodies of Hayden, 35, and his 30-year-old wife were found in the kitchen of their ranch homestead near Borroloola in Australia's vast and lonely Northern Territory after neighbors reported seeing "an enormous shimmering light" hovering in the vicinity.

"The light passed over my house at about 11:20," neighboring rancher Frank McCullough, 50, told MIDNIGHT. "It was moving slowly so I got a good look at it."

"My wife and six other people who work for me here saw the thing. It was no dream. It all saw it."

McCullough said he and the others watched the object for more than five minutes.

"But like they'd seen something so shocking and disgusting that they couldn't stand it. It's hard to describe their expressions but I hope I never see anyone with that look again.

"Both the bodies were what you might call 'arranged.' They were placed carefully on the floor with the legs stretched straight out and the arms extended out away from the side of the bodies.

"There were no cuts, bruises, or other marks on the victims - and no indications of a struggle in the room.

"A collie dog belonging to Mr. Hayden was also found dead in the room. It was stretched straight out the same as Mr. and Mrs. Hayden. There were no marks of violence on the dog. It's as though it were growling when it died."

Inspector Owen made a second gruesome discovery outside the ranch house. Every animal within a circle extending 1,000 yards around the house was dead. "I found 22 dead cows, two cats, and an uncounted number of birds, gophers, snakes and the like. Everything was unmarked very, very dead."

After four days of investigations the bodies of Hayden and his wife were released for burial. The Australian Army vehicles moved into the area and official government cars brought detectives and scientists to the area.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

as it passed over his house
and moved in the direction of
the Hayden ranch.

"It made a funny high-
pitched noise as it moved
across the sky. There was
something frightening about
it. We all felt frightened but
we didn't know why. It just
didn't seem like anything
that we could call normal
and it frightened us."

Next to witness the flight
of the weird object were the
ranch hands who worked
for Hayden.

"We saw this light pass
over the north pasture and
about five miles from where
we were bunked," 43-year-
old foreman Bud Hollenby
said. "Even from that distance we could hear the noise
it made.

"It stopped and just sort
of hung in the sky at about
the spot where the house was
over there at the boss's
house.

"The closer we got, the
more scary that noise sounded. It was a hum or whine
that never stopped. It sounded like a big generator or
something, only higher-
pitched.

"Listening to that sound
was like walking through a
cemetery at night after someone has just finished telling
a really awful ghost story."

"We argued about it for
awhile but finally decided
to drive over and find out
what was going on."

Hollenby, Kirk McClaine,
32, and Winston Perry, 32,
got in their jeep and drove
toward the Hayden home
just driving, maybe about
12 minutes, we watched that
glowing light hang over the
house.

When the three men were
about a half a mile away
from the main house, the
whining noise suddenly got
much louder. The car motor
stopped dead, its lights went
out and even the heater stopped working.

The object in the sky
glowed so brightly they were
forced to shield their eyes.
Then suddenly it moved up
into the sky.

"It disappeared complete-
ly in about 30 seconds,"
said Hollenby. "When we
couldn't see it anymore
the car motor started
working again and the light
and heater went back on.

"We stepped on the gas and
got to the house as fast as
we could."

The three men discovered
the bodies of Hayden and
his wife and immediately
called for help.

First to arrive at the scene
was Police Inspector Thomas
Owen.

"The victims were lying on
the kitchen floor," he said.
"Both were nude with their
clothes neatly folded next
to their heads.

"The expressions on their
faces were horrible. Not like
they died in pain, mind you,

outside the house he found
a circular area 90 feet in
diameter that was completely scorched and burnt over.

"It looked like something
that was giving off a tremendous blast of heat reflected directly on or above that
spot," he said. "Even the
earth itself was scorched for
about two feet below the
surface."

The policeman concluded
his report on the strange
happenings at the Hayden
ranch by saying he believed
the report of an "object in
the sky" that hovered over
the house was "essentially
true in all respects. There
is no evidence to contradict
what the witnesses said they
saw and a great deal of evidence to back it up."

Less than 24 hours after
Inspector Owen's report went
to central Territorial Police headquarters, a light scene

and federal troops and officials moved out.

When pressed for comment,
a senior government official
told MIDNIGHT:

"If you don't use my name,
I'll tell you this much. We
don't know what killed the
Haydens. There wasn't a
mark inside or out that
would indicate foul play.
They died without any apparent medical cause.

"Something happened at
the Hayden place that we
don't understand. Until we
understand it, we have
nothing to say about it. And
there's no use asking anyone
in the government to give
you an explanation. As far
as we are concerned, this
thing never happened."

Other authorities, however, were not so reluctant
to speak. Australian newspaper, Percival Hart, told
MIDNIGHT:

"The people who saw
the thing over the Hayden
place are all sober, reliable in
their deals with regulations
and honesty. The government
can pretend that it never
knew that it did.

"We've got a double?
killer or our hands and
killer or killers used a flying saucer to arrive at and
the scene of the crime.
There's something there and it can kill will
leaving a trace. None of
us are safe anymore."

United Air Lines

Denver, Colorado

Dear Captain:

Captain [redacted] whom I have met here at the Martin Marietta Corporation in Baltimore, has asked me to write you regarding a UFO sighting by me on the night of February 3, 1968.

I was flying a Lockheed JetStar at 33,000 feet and indicating Mach 0.82. The weather was clear with unrestricted visibility. A beam from a light was observed at three o'clock and higher than my flight. A guess would put it fifteen or twenty thousand feet higher. At first, the light appeared to resemble a flight of two aircraft in trail. The light moved at a high rate of speed, at a steady course and altitude. My heading was 870 to N would guess its heading was about 50°.

As it passed at 12 o'clock, they definitely appeared as two distinct light sources. Each light source emitted that I would describe as a pencil beam of light. This beam had no taper, did not trail off but maintained a constant cross section and ended abruptly. I would describe it as whitish in color changing to phosphorescent. The changes in color were subtle and did not appear modulated.

When these lights moved to 1100 o'clock the front light seemed to be outdistancing the rear light. The rear lights at this angle appeared as two distinct lights of the same intensity and both could readily be identified as pencil beams of light. A few seconds later, it all disappeared from sight because of the distance from my position.

The time was approximately 1045 p.m. EST. My course was a doppler track from FWD direct to END. Drift was six degrees right. The total time this was observed was between 40 and 50 seconds. All this observation is as it was actually witnessed and my copilot concurs with everything as to its status here.

I compare this with meteorites, missile re-entries and satellites I have seen and am certain this is none of these. I hope this information is helpful to you. I made a complete report to IND center and heard perhaps a half a dozen carrier pilots make similar report.

Drop me a line when you compare this and next time I am in Denver, I would enjoy a chat with you.

Yours very truly,
