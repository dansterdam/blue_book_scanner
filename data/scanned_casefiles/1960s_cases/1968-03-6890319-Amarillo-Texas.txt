PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE/TIME GROUP: 6 Mar 68  06/1130Z

2. LOCATION: Amarillo, Texas (3 Witnesses)

3. SOURCE: Civilian & Military

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: See Case

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual 1

7. COURSE: At about 0530 first observer sighted an object that was described as being like the edge of a plate but quite thick in the center. It remained stationary briefly then tilted, taking the form of the top view of a plate and sped away eastward. At 0610 another observer was enroute to Amarillo AFB when she heard a noise similar to a wind tunnel or a tornado. She also observed a light traveling eastward. She drove to a truck stop where she stopped and asked for the manager to observe the object. At about 0625 the truck stop manager stopped outside and observed a bright light to its east. He tried to follow it in his car but the light quickly disappeared. Meanwhile the other observer continued to Amarillo AFB.

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Possible (AIRCRAFT) There were no radar paints of unusual objects. A shallow investigation under which a thin layer of smoke was trapped existed at the time of the sighting. Several aircraft were in the area during the time of the sighting (see cases). The sighting appears to be an aircraft that was in the area with landing lights on.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: About 15 minutes later approx 0700

FORM: FTD SEP 63 0-329 (TDE)

Major Hottinger stated that she left her residence at 2500 S. Spring Street in Amarillo at approximately 0510 enroute to Amarillo AFB where she is a nurse at the base hospital. She was driving North on Eastern Street and was about to turn East onto Highway 287 when she heard a loud noise she described as similar to a wind tunnel or a tornado. She stopped her car, stepped out of it and looked around. She said she observed an object an estimated 1000 feet above and to the East of her. She looked around for other people and seeing none, she centered her car and started driving East on 287 to find someone to which she could report the sighted object. The object preceded her Eastward at a position where she could see it just below the top of her windshield at speeds up to 90 MPH. After driving 3 miles, she pulled into a Shelly Truck Stop at Pullman Switch Road and Highway 287, went into the service station and asked the manager, [redacted] to come outside and observe the object. Major Hottinger said that she proceeded outside and the object was still visible. The object moved Eastward at extremely high speed. [redacted] followed the object behind in her car. She said she continued to observe the object until she turned off Highway 287 North onto Spur Road at which time it went out of sight. Major Hottinger stopped at the South Gate Guard House and asked the Air Policeman on duty, AIC Joseph [redacted], if he had seen anything unusual and he said he had not. Major Hottinger then informed him of her experience and then proceeded to her duty station at the hospital on base.

Observer - Name: AlC Joseph F. Winfield     Age: 20
            Address: Hq Sq Air Base Group, AAFB, Texas
            Phone: 349-1511, Ext 200         Occupation: Air Policeman

Reporter - Same as above

Receiver - Air Police Desk, AAFB, Texas, Ext 200           Date: 6 March 1968

Description:
AlC Joseph F. Winfield, Jr. was on duty at the South Gate at approximately 0615 hours, when Major Hottinger stopped at the gate to report an object following her... Major Hottinger told him that yellow object with a red light had followed her from the left side home. She reported that she stopped at a filling station to make sure of what she had seen. The station attendant then followed the object. The object stopped following the Major when she turned onto the South Gate road. About 15 minutes later Airman Winfield was looking to the rear of the gate house when he saw a yellow light or object with a red flashing light on top, drop from a dark cloud and then make a right angle turn and travel horizontally and then go straight back up to the cloud. At that time he called Security Police Desk to report that he had seen. The size of the object was about that of a semi-truck and did not have any noise or sound at all. The location of the object was Northeast near the golf course. He could see one out of the cloud about half the speed that it traveled horizontally. He guessed the object to be about 700 to 800 feet high. He saw the object for only 5 to 6 seconds from the time it appeared to the time it disappeared. He called the desk and asked for the Flight Commander but he did not come. He made a report when he got off duty.

WEATHER CONDITIONS

A shallow inversion existed over AMA this morning from surface to 4,000 feet MSL due 3.5° to radiational cooling. A thin layer of smoke was in the area trapped under this inversion. Winds were light and variable.
Sky condition, 10,000 high overcast visibility 15*. Temperature was 41° at 0600.

Summation:

a. This series of sighting occurred during a 1½ hour period over a distance of approximately 5 miles in a general East-West line. Times of the sightings being from 0530 to 0700.

b. A temperature inversion occurred in the sighting area during a closely corresponding time; 0530 to 0800.

c. Sunrise was at 0710 CST.

d. Aircraft in the area of sighting and bearing flashing lights and/or exhaust flames are as follows:

Type Aircraft       Time    Direction of Takeoff
Continental DC-9    0612    South
Electra             0611    South
Conventional 210    0615    South
2 C-141             0625-0720   Practice Instrument Approaches

e. All four descriptions vary either in size, color, shape, or sound.

f. No radar sighting of unusual objects were observed.

g. A low cloud cover related to the inversion lay Southeast of and parallel to the area of sighting.

h. The sighting occurred along a line paralleled on the North by lights from the City of Amarillo, Texaco Refinery and Amarillo AFB.

No contact was made by the object with ground, persons or property nor was any residue found. No electric magnetic phenomena was associated with the sightings.

Conclusions: Based upon the conditions and circumstances cited above correlated to evidence provided by the AF - University of Colorado Conference, it appears most likely that these sightings were perceptual distortions in the form of mirages created by the temperature inversion.
The loud noises described by Major Hotchings cannot be identified but could have been from one of the aircraft operating near the point of sightings.
