11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a formation of approximately 31 objects move toward the west then turn left, stop, then move toward the north. The objects would go in and out of the clouds. In all the objects were seen 4 times during the 30 minute observation period. When the observers went to school the objects could not be seen. Observers said that the objects were bright and were as bright as a light bulb(100 watt).

Contact was made with the MP Base Operations concerning aircraft in the area. Two KC-135s on the morning of 4 Oct. 66, but at different times. No other formations were known by base operations. The description is consistent with that often reported for a bird formation.
