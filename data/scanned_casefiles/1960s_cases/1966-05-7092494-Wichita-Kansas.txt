1. INTRODUCTION:

A. Preliminary analysis: Preliminary investigation revealed 80-100 aircraft in the air over the Wichita area during the first sighting and 60-75 during the second. Initially, the objects were considered to be a satellite by the observers. Later this explanation was rejected. Prior to the first sighting, balloons were flying about on the street below but a considerable distance down and direct direction down was noticed. Each witness stated positively that the object was not an aircraft.

B. Comment on possible cause or identity: This attention is directed to size the objects might fit the description of a satellite. However, the straight line course and the tumbling action especially because of the straight line course and the tumbling action seen, would not conform to the description of a satellite. This conditions appears to optimize that possibly could have been misjudged.

C. Statement supporting preliminary analysis and comment: I can reach no firm conclusions. If this is not a satellite, perhaps a natural phenomenon - and was misconstrued: 1) Each time the sightings were discussed testimony seemed to change a little. 2) No one else in the area reported these two instances. If this were something incomprehensible to the public, someone else probably would have taken note of it. My only conclusion, based upon information is that this was not a validation from other space.
