1. INTRODUCTION:

A. Preliminary analysis: Preliminary investigation revealed 80-100 aircraft in the air over the Wichita area during the first sighting and 60-70 during the second. Initially, the objects were considered to be a satellite by the observers. Later this explanation was rejected. Prior to the first sighting, balloons were flying about on the street below; but a conflict between wind and object direction does not lend credence to this possible explanation of the cause. Each witness stated positively that the object was not an aircraft.

B. Comment on possible cause or identity:
Without attention to size the objects might fit the description of a satellite, especially because of the straight line course and the tumbling effect. In addition, no estimate of distance to the object could be rendered. This lends support, then, to the possibility that size could have been misjudged.

C. Statement supporting preliminary analysis and comment: I can reach no firm conclusions. If this is not a satellite, perhaps a natural phenomenon was misconstrued: 1) Each time the sightings were discussed testimony seemed to change a little. 2) No one else in the area reported these two instances. If this were something incomprehensible to the public, someone else probably would have taken note of it. My only conclusion, based upon feeling, is that this was not a visitation from outer space.
