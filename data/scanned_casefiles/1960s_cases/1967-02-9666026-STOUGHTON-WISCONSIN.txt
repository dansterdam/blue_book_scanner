Here is the OCR text from the document:

Until approximately 9:10
p.m., there was nothing unusual
about Thursday evening, February 16, for Lynn Marsh, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Donald
Marsh, Rt. 1.

She was driving home in her
parents' 1965 Oldsmobile after
attending a 4-H Club meeting
session at the home of one of
her club leaders, Mrs. Gordon
Nagy.

The radio was on to keep her
company as she drove down
Williams Drive and approached
the Surfitt School intersection
with County Trunk B.

Suddenly and inexplicably the
radio started buzzing. She
couldn't get a station although
she tried different frequencies.
It was the sort of thing that
happens when there is interference from powerlines, but
she turned her attention back to
the road, however, Thursday
evening, February 16, became
an evening that she will never forget.

At first, she thought a car
was approaching from her right
along County Trunk B. She
turned her head and saw a
time-white-blue-white, The
glimpse of light, however, was
not from a car. That deceiving
glimmer became defined into a
frightening reality as Lynn
watched a single, bright light
move toward her.

She estimates it was about two
house stories above the ground
and she could not see any substantial form. She didn't hear
any noise and she described
the bright light as being similar to that reflecting from a
car headlight. It came to within 50 feet of the intersection and
then, hovering there while
almost completely stationary, she finally moved
a few feet to the right and
turned her head. She
saw it arcing through the right
window - following beside her
car. She said the light left
tracks and she remembered
that's how she knows the time
must have been around 9:11
p.m. because that was her schedule. It was still there -

that familiar light, Skyline
Drive, a fast turn right and
the light crossed to her left,
cutting across the field by Hol-

land. -- all she remembers from then on is

driving much too fast, seeing
the yard light on at home,
the garage doors open, and a
rush to the front door and safety.

Once inside, the pent-up anxiety of the past few minutes
overwhelmed her and she completely broke down. Her coherency
was lost although she tried to
explain what had happened.

Her father checked her as was
usual outside. Her father
checked the car and Lynn had
turned off the key and the car
lights, although she could not
remember doing either.

A sleepless night followed and
at school the next day, where
Lynn is a senior, she didn't
tell any of her friends about
her experience. She did, however, talk to two teachers. Her
mother, hearing rumors from
other area sightings that evening, called a Madison radio station and she was told to call
Truax AFB to report the incident. Lynn, later that day, was
her story to a Truax officer
and it was forwarded to the UFO
Investigation Center at Denver,
Colo.

What was it? Well, it is now
classified as an Unidentified
Flying Object. There will
most likely be an investigation
in the near future to determine
just what it was. Investigators
may find a perfectly natural
and logical cause for the
phenomenon, but then again,
it may become one of the few
cases of UFOs which thus far
have defied reasonable explanation.

The other reports of UFOs
from Madison and near Detroit
were written of air sightings of airplanes
which have a new type of lighting system.

In this case, positive it was not
a plane -- it came too close
to the ground, as to other given
explanations for UFOs, there
are no positive lines here
sightings, which could possibly
have caused a freak electrical
disturbance or swamp gas or
swamps creating swamp gas.
Prior to Thursday, Lynn
didn't believe in flying saucers
or UFOs in general, but now
she isn't so sure. She now
believes, she knows that she
will doesn't sleep too well at
night and as for driving alone
after dark -- well, that may
eventually be possible again.

I'm enclosing a news clipping, which my family and myself truly hold, but it includes some points. The enclosed act can best summarize, notably, this story is an exact experienced article, but as far the truth, it's fairly correct. Ond min in-cover fact: I did see it again that night, after coming down, I was looking out of my upstairs window (south) and saw it over the neighbors farm about a mile away. Oddly enough, it was the same size as it was when beside my car. I was not hallucinating, my perception was clear. I know downstairs in the living room (concentration) but by time they got to a window it was gone.

I can't understand it and am absolutely positive I wasn't plane! I've checked all possibilities! If you desire any further information I'll gladly cooperate. I've done my best to forget, but filled out this questionnaire direct the other sightings in Madison, etc. I didn't hear about them until morning & I'm sure of what I saw!
