WRIST WATCH

[Handwritten note at bottom: "send the witness 2"]

Most other text is partially obscured or blurry, but the key details are visible on this Air Force form documenting what appears to be a UFO sighting report.


- page 5 -

Here is the text from the document:

[Question 12 response is particularly clear]
BRIGHTER THAN A STAR-BUT NO RAYS
BOTTOM WAS ROUNDED, TOP WAS FUZZY

Most other text is partially legible, with various form fields and checkboxes visible. The document appears to be a UFO sighting report form with multiple sections asking about observation details such as weather conditions, object appearance, brightness, and movement.

Some legible sections include options for:
- Cloud conditions
- Object appearance (solid, translucent, vapor)
- Brightness comparison
- Object movement and characteristics

The form seems designed to systematically collect detailed information about an unidentified flying object sighting.

14. Did the object move sideways with watching it, or in a way:
IT WENT BEHIND A CLOUD

15. Did the object move behind or alongside of any time, particularly a cloud?
A CLOUD

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)   Yes   No   Don't know.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound:   NONE
b. Color:   LIKE A LIGHT

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and how much of the object is covered by this head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by its head?
MOST OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your description any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially salient points of your trail. Place an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

RURAL DISTRICT

JUST AS A LIGHT

The document appears to be a page from a UFO report with some hand-drawn or sketched circular shapes and minimal text.


- page 8 -

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects moved. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, only, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling

The text at the top of the page is partially illegible due to image quality, but appears to be part of an instruction or description.

The page contains two diagrams: one showing a curved trajectory from a point near some buildings, and another showing a circular compass-like view with points marked A and B.
