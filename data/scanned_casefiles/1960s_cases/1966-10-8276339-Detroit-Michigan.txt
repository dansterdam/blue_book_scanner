SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFSC)(FTD), Ohio

The following UFO Report is submitted:

a. Description of Object:
   (1) Oblong, Bright trailing white-like phosphorous burning from end, very bright pink-red in middle and bright green in front.
   (2) About 1-1/2 pen size.
   (3) Green-red-white, all very bright
   (4) One
   (5) 10
   (6) Red and Green areas were constant, while trail varied slightly in shape.
   (7) Brilliant white tail about 1½ times as long as green and red area.
   (8) None
   (9) The red part was about 7-10 times bigger than the red running light of the light plane, and the green part was about 2½ times bigger than the red part, and the white part was about 1½ times as long as the green and red part.

b. Description of Course of Object:
   (1) Just happened to look up and at first thought I was looking at a shooting star because of brilliant white light.
   (2) Have no idea as to its height, but a light single engine plane I observed immediately after was about 1/5 of height, angle parallel to earth.
   (3) The angle remained constant, that of parallel flight, as did the height.
   (4) No maneuver other than going straight across the sky from East to West - when first observed it was like starting on my right almost directly in front of me.
   (5) It disappeared going at an amazing rate of speed - about five times faster than a jet going to the west - it disappeared into some tree tops still at a high rate of speed.
   (6) From 3-6, maybe 7 seconds.

c. Manner of Observation:
   (1) Ground visual
   (2) None
   (3) N/A
