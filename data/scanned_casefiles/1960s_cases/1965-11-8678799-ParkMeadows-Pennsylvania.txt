I was standing on my driveway, facing to the northern horizon of same the object. I watched it as it moved in a elliptical orbit, moved slowly as it appeared to me at a distance of about 1 mile. I stood and viewed what I was doing. I called my mother, who was in our cellar, I pointed the object out to her. She came up, she said, "he can't see what he's watching." I for a minute later, my mother went inside. I stepped out and watched the object. Then it reappeared in if --- the point had turned off the lights. This was the first I saw of it.

Dear Maj. Quintanilla,

My name is [redacted]

Long time station spread out and live in Park Meadows (housing plan). I spotted a U.F.O. to the north of me. I do not know the exact day but it was the first week of November at mine's clock.

Helen (was) standing in my driveway & noticed in the sky a ring of lights. This object was orbiting above some point on the ground as it looked to me. The object had a ring of rotating lights in the middle and had a glow on the top and bottom. I saw sight of it for 10 minutes later. My friend, I spotted to me that some body was here on the hill of our place.
