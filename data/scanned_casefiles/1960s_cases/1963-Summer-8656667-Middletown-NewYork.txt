Dear Sirs:

I read an article in the Medical Tribune which says you are still interested in flying objects in the sky.

I would like to tell you what I saw. About 2 years ago I was looking at the sky from my bedroom window. It was one of those nights when the sky was a carpet of stars and in the northwest near the horizon I saw what I at first thought were falling stars but then I realized they were brighter than stars and were darting in all directions. I watched for about maybe 20 or 30 seconds and then they all darted into a formation like this-

[A hand-drawn diagram of an oval/circular formation with multiple dots/circles arranged around the perimeter of the shape]

They were perfectly spaced in this formation and stayed in this position for I should say about 30 seconds, then one by one they flew north near the horizon at a tremendous speed, they were all out of sight in just a few seconds. I am not sure of the number, perhaps there were 8 or 10.

All this I saw very plainly, about 9:30 or 10 o'clock at night.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]

Reference the attached letter requesting information on an unidentified flying object which she observed about two years ago. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Ms [redacted]

Your observation of about two years ago is, of course, too old to warrant an investigation. The sighting in itself is very puzzling. The attached brochure indicates the current situation in regards to the Air Force unidentified flying object program.
