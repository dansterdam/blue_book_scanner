One object with no ground it. Color green, no features trail exhaust or spot. Initial sighting to North. Disappeared over horizon. With best reported. In sight for one hour. Investigated official records the most likely cause as a star. Direction missing. Flight to East can be explained if azimuth not correct. Some 14 sent for clarification, not returned.

INTELLIGENCE/THIS PARTICULAR OBSERVATION OCCURRED DURING THE
PERIOD OF MY REPORT, DUOIN 00093. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS PERSON
SAW THE SAME OBJECT AS COVERED IN THE OTHER REPORT, HOWEVER THE
PAGE 4 RUCDDU 9 UNCLAS

OBJECT APPARENT MOVEMENT TO THE EAST WOULD TEND TO RULE THIS OUT.
THE COLOR OF RED AND GREEN BEING EMITTED BY THE OBJECT CAN POSSIBLY
BE EXPLAINED THAT THE OBSERVER WAS ONLY SEEING THE RED AND GREEN
PORTIONS OF THE COLOR SPECTRUM DUE TO IMMEDIATE LOCAL DUST CONDITIONS
OR LIGHT REFRACTION OCCURING AROUND THE OBJECT. IN THE PAST, I HAVE
NOTED THAT STARS OCCASIONALLY SEEM TO EMIT GREEN AND RED LIGHT.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OBJECT SEEN WAS A SATELLITE BUT MOST PROBABLY
A STAR.
