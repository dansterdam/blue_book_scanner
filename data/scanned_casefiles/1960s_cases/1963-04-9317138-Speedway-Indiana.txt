Dear Sir:

This may not be of much importance to you but to me it is.

On the 14 by 11/63 saw a strange object to the northwest about 2 miles west of Speedway, Indiana. It was white to the naked eye and seemed to be a round disc as well 120 to 150 feet in diameter. It was stationary and quite in the sky. Might add it was on the ground for some 20 to 30 minutes at a height of 10 to 20 feet. From my observation it was very bright. Witnessed by the state police and it was very bright. I might add it was very bright.

The text on the page is partially legible. I can make out:

"...something with something into
of all scientific..."

"...you could why to prove what it is you
ing on was what is..."

There is a black redacted/blacked out section in the middle of the page, and the text is faint and difficult to fully read. The bottom of the page appears to be blank.
