Received from Major Hart, Godd West, 12 April 54, 1964:

Re: Unidentified Flying Objects

Mercd passed the following information to BHIC:

Mercd believes it is a balloon drifting westward at 17 knots.

One of the two F-106 pilots was able to lock on to it at 50,000 ft., but was not able to hold.

Neither pilots reported visible sighting.

Mercd is continuing to make all effort to identify this object or objects.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

Original Message
NOCC, Norad advised that there were 6 to 12 unidentified flying objects at 30 miles East of Merced, California. Radar picked up 12 objects at altitudes 60,000 ft., 90,000 ft., and higher elevations.

F-106's were scrambled at Castle Air Force Base. There were no results because of high altitudes. They are checking the possibility of sending U-2's.

Later Sent to Air Staff
Objects were following a 60 mile race-track pattern. F-106's were flying at 30,000 ft. altitude. Pilots locked on to some of the objects but could not keep the lock. Norad said they were sending 2 more aircraft with pilots in pressure suits.
