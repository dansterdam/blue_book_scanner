Round cone, size of a basketball, blue, red, white, green and orange. Had flickers at the point and tail. Bright glow as it went and hovering overhead going in a NE direction and disappearing over the horizon behind mountains. Gave the appearance of tumbling.

11. COMMENTS
Sighting was 5 min. Report came from 15 sources consolidated in one report. Though no definite explanation was found, this duration or covered the limits of reporting sighting. Also colors from opposing ends of the spectrum, and similar to reporting if all these colors were reported by all witnesses or if this was a composite.

Or whether all reported a similar thing. The duration was that of a meteor, this sighting would be identified as such.

Also an error was found to be 36 as an evaluation. Transcriber's note for evaluation.
