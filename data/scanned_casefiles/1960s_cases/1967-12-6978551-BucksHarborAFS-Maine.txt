UFPO (UPO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/msa/14 Jun 68

UFO Observation, December 10, 1967

Valley Station, Kentucky, 40272

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of December 10, 1967. The object that you sighted at 0026 hours was probably a weather balloon that was released at 0018 hours. Although the surface wind was toward the southwest at four knots, at 6,000 ft altitude it was toward the northeast at twenty-one knots. These balloons usually ascend at approximately 1000 ft./minute and can be observed until an altitude of about 10,000 ft.

2. Radar usually does not paint these balloons unless they have a metal reflector attached.

3. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

[Note: Some parts of the text are difficult to read due to image quality, so I'll transcribe what I can clearly make out]

[The rest of the text is partially legible, with many words and lines being unclear or cut off. Some fragments I can discern include:]

The document is an "Index to streets LOUISVILLE and adjacent areas" which appears to be a street directory/map index. The page contains multiple columns of street names and corresponding grid references/locations. On the right side of the page is a partial street map of Louisville showing street layouts and grid sections. At the bottom right of the map, there is a small section labeled "Places of Interest". The map appears to include areas of Clark County and shows street grid patterns and what seems to be a river or waterway on the left side of the map.

This appears to be a directory or phone book page with multiple columns of names and addresses. The page includes sections labeled "New Albany", "Clarksville", "Hospitals", "Yacht and Boat Clubs", "Golf and Country Clubs", and "Parks and Playgrounds". There are also sections for "Jefferson County" and "Jefferson Ville". On the right side of the page, there is a detailed street map or city layout with numerous street lines and intersections.

The text consists primarily of lists of names, likely organized alphabetically, with corresponding addresses or other information. Due to the density of the text and the image quality, I cannot reliably transcribe specific names or details without risking inaccuracy.

Street Map of Louisville

Prepared by
Standard Oil Company (Kentucky)

Legend:
- Thick black lines: Major roads/highways
- Thinner lines: Streets
- Various symbols for different types of roads and transportation routes

The map shows a detailed street layout of Louisville, with numerous streets, intersections, and urban features. The map includes street names, though most are too small to read clearly at this resolution. The bottom right corner contains the map's title and publication information.

The map appears to be from an older era, likely mid-20th century, based on the style and printing technique.

This image appears to be a detailed street map or city map with numerous streets, roads, and intersections. There is a text box in the lower left quadrant of the map, but the text within it is too small and blurry to read clearly. The map seems to cover a large urban or suburban area with a complex street grid. A Chevron logo is visible in the upper right area of the map. The map is in black and white with intricate line work showing street layouts, block boundaries, and possibly some geographical features like water bodies or terrain contours.
