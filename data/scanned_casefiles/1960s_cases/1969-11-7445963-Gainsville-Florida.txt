Transcription of the text in the document:

UNTYPED

As per phone conversation with Mr. Hynek, the enclosed report is forwarded for your information and handling. Apparently, it describes an unusual aerial object observed near Gainsville, Florida, during the period November 7, 1969.

The report appears to be complete and, except for the apparently handwritten notation "UNTYPED" at the top of the page, contains no other handwritten material. The description of the observed object indicates that it was of an unusual nature and apparently gave the observers some concern. However, no conclusions are drawn or recommendations made.

A MILITARY OFFICER INVESTIGATED THE REPORTING
OFFICER'S FINDINGS AND CONCLUDED THAT THE REPORT WAS
APPARENTLY NOT CONTRARY TO AIR FORCE REGULATIONS 
THAT REQUIRE THE REPORTING OF UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA. 
THE OFFICER STATED THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE REPORT WAS
GENUINE AND THAT THE OBJECT SEEN COULD HAVE BEEN AN
UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON. HE RECOMMENDED THAT 
THE REPORT BE RETAINED BY THE PROJECT AND CONSIDERED
AS PART OF THE OVERALL DATA COLLECTION EFFORT.
IT IS REPORTED THAT THE SPACE CENTER, THE GOODYEAR
BLIMP, AND SEVERAL AIRCRAFT WERE OPERATING IN THE IMMEDIATE
AREA AT THAT TIME. THIS AREA IS NEAR GAINSVILLE, FLORIDA.
THERE WERE NO COMMENTS FROM THE AGENCIES OR 
WITNESSES KNOWN TO BE POSSIBLE.
