TO: AEDC (FTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Following is a summary of UFO activity in the Hawaiian area, 1 August to 5 August 1965. Five UFOs were reported. One of them (part b) apparently was widely dispersed headlights in Hawaii resulting in increased reporting and publicity.

2. On 3 August, 06002 (3/2000 local) a family living in Wahiawa sighted an unusual bright lights moving across the sky at high altitudes and on various headings. The lights appeared to maneuver erratically from red to blue during the sighting. This sighting was made from a position approximately 7 miles from Wheeler AFB and the lights appeared to be about 5 miles away. They were flying over a heavily populated area. 

3. On 4 August, 06447 (3/2044 local) numerous sightings were made of an object which fell from the sky southofDanni. The reports differed on the color but all agreed that it was a very bright light. Two pilots who were flying at 31,000 on the 289 radial 150 NM out of Honolulu VORTAC radar saw it. Both pilots believed that it burned out before hitting the water. It appeared to descend at a steep angle and it seemed to be an entry vehicle. The two pilots thought it could have been from U.S. space operations and it is unlikely that it was Russianin origin. There was a rapidly decaying space vehicle, which fell approximately 150 NM southeast of Oahu.

Transcribing the text from the document:

On 5 August 62 (approximately) the crew of a high altitude C-130 aircraft sighted a bright light at 30,000 feet which was flying erratically overhead.

(1) Ocean station November sighted the same object and reported that it seemed to be very close to the aircraft as it passed overhead.

(2) Investigation revealed that it was probably an Atlas missile fired from Vandenberg AFB. The bright light was caused by a flash fire from fuel still left in the booster on separation. The missile flight was not exactly sure of the time. Therefore it delivered the sighting and the same missile flight were in fact one and the same.

3. On 5 August at 1311Z, several aircraft at 28-33N/145W, reported a rocket firing from the surface of the ocean. The object climbed rapidly and flew towards the group of five ships within the area of the launch.

4. A query to CINCPACFLT OPS PLOT revealed that in that time and area, a Navy operation being conducted involving five ships.

5. Also on 5 August at 0500Z, a teenager reported a bright light and checked on this. Since no other sighting was made, no further action was taken.

2. This information is forwarded as background information only.

I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

DATE 2 August 1965
PLACE HONOLULU, HAWAII AREA
REPORT NO. 8-7464725
RECEIVED 25 AUGUST 1965
WITNESS: [redacted]
SUMMARY: 
On 2 August 1965, [redacted] observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be a considerable distance away. The object was moving rapidly in a northerly direction. It then suddenly stopped and hovered for a few seconds. The object then took off at a high rate of speed in a southerly direction, and was quickly out of sight. [redacted] states that the object was not an aircraft, helicopter, or satellite, and that it was unlike anything he had ever seen before. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds.

CONCLUSIONS:
This sighting is classified as Unidentified. The object observed does not match the characteristics of any known aircraft, helicopter, satellite, or other conventional aerial vehicle. The rapid acceleration and high speed maneuvering of the object is characteristic of many unidentified flying object reports. Without any additional data or evidence, the origin and nature of this object cannot be determined.
