REPORT OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT SIGHTED 10/12/68

Time/Place- About 7:45 to 8:00 PM EST at Fort Mill, South Carolina.

Duration- About fifteen minutes

Number of Observers- Two sixteen year old high school boys

Name/Address of Observers- [Redacted]
Street, Fort Mill, South Carolina 29715
[Redacted] also of Fort Mill

Shape- Egg shaped, Peer shaped
[Redacted], however, was not wearing his glasses at the time. But his eye defect is not severe. He reads well without glasses.

Both agree that the object was oval shaped and larger at one than the other.

Dimensions- About three times larger and brighter than Venus.

Color- Fire white, changing to red when it moved

Sound- None

Altitude- Estimated to be a few hundred feet high at a distance of about one half to one mile.

Speed- Quick, but not too fast

Details of Sighting- We turned off Davis Bridge Road onto Fairway Drive. The object was sighted above the trees and was below an overcast sky. I thought it was a helicopter and McFadden thought it was a planet. After traveling a quarter of a mile we passed the home of [Redacted] and saw the object clearly as we passed the pond beside his home. It was then that the egg or peer shape was noticed. We decided to go on the Ridgeway Road to see it better.

We turned left at the intersection of Factory Drive and Bandy Street and proceeded toward the Belmont Park. We stopped right after traveling mile and a quarter. Some after making the turn, we stopped at railroad track to check for a coming train.

We then looked up and saw the object through a clearing. It was clearly visible on an egg or very strange object. We then moved quickly along the Belmont Road to the old Everett Family graveyard which faces a open field and has a parking place. The object seemed not to have moved and seemed to be over the Button Road area. Less than a minute after we stopped the object turned red and dropped to an altitude of less than two hundred feet.

As soon as it stopped dropping it resumed a white color. We then headed for the Button Road area but discovered as soon as we were on Button Road that the object was now over Rock Hill, S.C. and had regained altitude. We had to drive along a woods before we could turn around, and when we could scan the sky once more it was gone.

We don't know what the object is, but we think that the Air Force might like to check into this case. We have heard stories about strange lights in this area but this is the first time we've seen one. We swear that we saw the object we described as well as we can. We will be glad to answer any other questions you might have. I am filing this report for myself and my telephone is [illegible]. I would like to know what your verdict is when you reach it.

Yours truly,

[Signature area is blacked out]
