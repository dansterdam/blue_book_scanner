MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                   7 September 1967

Subject: UFO Sighting, 6 September 1967, Cincinnati, Ohio

Mr. [REDACTED] of [REDACTED], Cincinnati 15, Ohio and his neighbors observed an unidentified flying object at 950 pm. Mr. [REDACTED] said he was intrigued at what he saw. The duration of the sighting was at least twenty minutes long, his next door neighbor observed the object while walking his dog. He and his son put binoculars and telescope on the object. The object looked like somebody reached down and put the object out. The object never changed position, it was in the west, 270 deg az and 75 deg elev.

The object was perfectly stationary. The pulsating was similar to that of a lightning bug but not quite the same. Mr. [REDACTED] gave his boy and the neighbors boy a pencil, and they all drew the same thing. It looked like the bottom of our space ships, with cracks in the surface, similar to that of a volcano. Mr. [REDACTED] said he didn't know if anybody was aboard but he sure would like to know what the object is. Mr. [REDACTED] feels that the people in this country are not crazy and that the Air Force has been a little pooh pooh about the sightings. Mr. [REDACTED] used to be in the Air Force.

Mr. [REDACTED] glad that the University of Colorado is doing their own independent evaluational investigations into UFOs. Major Quintanilla said he would send him four copies of PID Form 164 so that he and his neighbors could complete them and return them in the self-addressed envelope.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observers sighted a light that was white in the center with an orange ring, a dark space and then blue rays or flames. The observer estimated the height to be 1000 to 1500 ft.

COMMENTS: Nothing unusual was noticed on radar. No pilots reported anything unusual to the control tower in Waterloo or Aurora, Ill. It seems possible that the sighting could have been of a small plane or helicopter with its landing lights on or even of the Planet Venus which was at about 14 deg elevation and 84 deg azimuth during the time of sighting.

Gentlemen:

I have been advised by the
Cleveland Special Investigation Agency in
Cleveland to contact your office in order to
report a strange sighting made by a friend
and myself as we drove west on Cedar Avenue
towards Cleveland from Gates Mills, on Tues.
July 25. The sighting took place at approx.
1115 P.M. and we telephoned the Lynhurst
police at approx. 1125 P.M. Although the
police listened politely and said it would
be reported to the proper agency, I believe
it is possible that they did not take us
seriously enough to do so. Both of us are
very certain that what we saw was no air
craft operated by the United States, and that
it can not be explained away as some kind of
"natural phenomenon."

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Case-
Western Reserve Program of Philosophical
Studies. My companion on that night was
Mr. [ILLEGIBLE], a graduate student at Case
Institute of Technology who will be graduated
as a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering this Sept.

I talked to Lt. Carr about the sightings. He has not investigated it yet, however he is going to investigate. All information that he has is completely second hand. He has received through news media the following:

A little before 0400 I a Mrs. of Casian woke up and saw a bright object skimming over the tree tops. She observed it for about 1Â½ min.

Sometime before 0400 I a farmer from Farnasburg named [REDACTED] saw a red tinged object that hurt his eyes when he looked at it.

At about 0,001 two police officers from Gelein ( one was the assist. chief of police) saw a circular object that was about a mile away. The object emitted blue rays that hurt their eyes. The object was first headed SE but then turned E. They followed it for about 2 mile till it turned NE. They continued to follow another 2 mile till their car had a flat tire and they were forced to stop.

At or about the same time a motorist on the road from Gelein to Strawberry saw a bright object that hurt his eyes. It seemed to go too slowly to be an airplane. He followed it for a while but finally lost it.

A little later three girls at Prairie Du Chien reported seeing a UFO to the Nuns at the school (?) they attend.

On Tuesday evening we were driving west on Cedar Road at approximately 30 miles an hour I was driving, and through the windshield I noticed a peculiar light ahead of us and to my left. It first caught my attention because it was much too low to be an airport searchlight, although that is the best analogy I can offer of what I saw. At first I saw a light, while later that Mr. also noticed it was still ahead of us. As we came closer, it was still ahead of us and we saw what lo-ked like 1, 2, or 3 streaks of glowing light. Perfectly parallel to the road, going east and moving parallel to the road, giving the best description we could, it seemed somewhat disconnected at that moment. It illuminated space. We looked at the time it was moving through space, and it wasn't until they were 4 or 5 distinct objects that we could see it as 4 or 5 distinct glowing objects traveling very fast and in seeming perfect formation.

The most peculiar aspects of what we saw were: 1, the objects were moving quite low (Mr. 30-50 feet); 2, they were quite close to, and parallel to, the highway we were driving on; 3, they were traveling in perfect formation, at a rather high speed (although nothing like the speed of a jet plane) and were moving in a definite

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

The object was observed only as a bright light. It changed course briefly. Not stopped its previous course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

IN 1944, AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN, I WAS
A VOLUNTEER CIVILIAN AIRPLANE SPOTTER. I
HAD MORE THAN A YEAR OF EXPERIENCE
OBSERVING AIRCRAFT (AND IDENTIFYING THEM) DURING
BOTH DAYTIME AND NIGHTTIME HOURS.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
30     10     1967
Day    Month   Year
REPORT WAS MADE TO WRIGHT UFO DEPARTMENT.

Here is the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    2    11    1967
     Day    Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I OBSERVED THIS OBJECT FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES. THE FIRST OBSERVATION WAS MADE ON 29 OCTOBER, 1967 AT 8:30 P.M. - THE SECOND OBSERVATION WAS MADE ON THE SAME DATE AT MIDNIGHT. THE THIRD OBSERVATION WAS MADE ON 30 OCTOBER, 1967 AT 9:45 P.M. THE FOURTH OBSERVATION WAS ON 30 OCTOBER, 1967 AT 10:00 P.M. AND IS THE OBSERVATION DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT.

THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED IN THE MOST INCREDIBLE MANNER DURING THE SECOND SIGHTING (MIDNIGHT ON 29 OCTOBER, 1967). THE FIRST OBSERVATION MADE ME QUITE CURIOUS SO I SPENT SEVERAL PERIODS OF 30 MINUTES OR THEREABOUTS STANDING IN MY SIDE YARD IN AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS OBJECT AND PERHAPS IDENTIFY IT AT MIDNIGHT. I WAS LOOKING TO THE WEST WHEN INSTANTLY AND SUDDENLY A BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHT APPEARED APPROXIMATELY TEN DEGREES TO THE RIGHT OF THE SKY AT WHICH I WAS LOOKING. THE LIGHT APPEARED ALONE (SLIGHTLY) AND BEYOND A LARGE SOLITARY TREE WHICH STANDS APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET (OVER)


- page 48 -

Here is the text from the document:

Away from my yard, the object was
at less than 15 degrees elevation. It
remained absolutely stationary for a
period which I would estimate at
five or six seconds and then glided
away to the north (slightly NE) at
perhaps 200 mph. (The object remained
in sight on all four occasions until
it disappeared over the horizon a little
north of northwest.) At no time
did the object emit any sound of
any kind. It never appeared to flicker.
Go on and off, nor did it change speeds.
It appeared only as a very bright light
which, during the first and fourth
observations especially became intensely
bright. These brightest periods lasted for
approximately two or three seconds
each and occurred during each observation.

I might add that observations #1 and #2
were made on a bright and cloudless
night. Also, the fact that the object
was motionless is something to which
I am absolutely certain inasmuch as
my yard is situated almost 1/4 mile
back a lane and is very quiet. The
sounds of both jet and propeller driven

AIRCRAFT ARE CLEARLY VISIBLE FOR LONG DISTANCES IN MY YARD SINCE THERE ARE PRACTICALLY NO COMPETITIVE SOUNDS AND THE AREA IS OPEN.

I AM UNABLE TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION ON THE CONFIGURATION OF THIS OBJECT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ENTIRE OBJECT WAS BRIGHTLY LIGHTED. IT HAD NO NAVIGATION LIGHTS -- JUST THE BRIGHT ILLUMINOSITY OF THE OBJECT ITSELF. ON TWO OCCASIONS DURING OBSERVATION #4 IT CHANGED COLOR, GOING FROM BRIGHT YELLOW TO BRIGHT WHITE.

IN 1944 I OBSERVED A WEATHER PHENOMENON KNOWN AS "BALL LIGHTNING." THIS OBJECT BORE NO RESEMBLANCE TO "BALL LIGHTNING." IT WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT OF ANY TYPE. IT WAS NOT A METEORITE. IT WAS NOT A CELESTIAL BODY.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS BUT IT APPEARED AS A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO GLIDE ALONG -- SILENTLY. IT WAS NOTHING EVEN REMOTELY SIMILAR TO ANYTHING WHICH I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE.

I will say that it was an eerie
and somewhat frightening sight. In fact,
it frightened my wife into tears.

I would appreciate it if you
can offer some credible and reasonable
explanation regarding what this object
might have been. I am not a "flying
saucer" nut - but I must admit that
I can't help wondering what in hell
I saw.

When I have an opportunity I
will continue to look for this object.
(All four observations were flying
the same course - from SW to NE)
Now being the point at which the object
disappeared over the horizon.) Perhaps
if I continue to scan SW I might
see it again - this time I'll try
to photograph the object with a camera
which I have loaded and ready. I'll notify
you. Thank you.

Very truly yours

direction.

All of this took place within a few seconds, but I have tried to describe as best as I can how it appeared at each successive stage--that is, at the points at which it passed us. Locking back through the rear window, we were no longer able to see it.

The area alongside of the highway over which it was flying was somewhat open and desolate. We did not detect any sounds from the objects, and there were no other cars on the road at that moment. We stopped at a gas station a few minutes later and telephoned the police.

I am reporting this to you in case you have received other reports on that evening and may find this information useful.

This thing was strange, but it was too far away to see any shape. It did not get close enough to land. It was not moving - to its really but seemed to be going very slowly away up in sky.

It started going up, then when it got up so far it stopped moving up, but instead moved westward.

Now when it stopped moving upward and for moving westward it traveled in one place a long while then moved to the southwest.
