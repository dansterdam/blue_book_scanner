Dear Mr. [redacted]

It is not true that the Air Force withholds or censors any information concerning unidentified flying objects. Our files have always been open to news representatives and scientific researchers.

Attached is a copy of PTD Form 164 which is used for reporting UFO observations to the Air Force. You will submit a report of your sightings, the Air Force will evaluate it, and you will be informed of the conclusions.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

Gentlemen;

Before we start we want to tell you that we respect our countries' Air Force and what it is doing for the defense of our country and the free world.

The organization called NICAF (National Investigation Committees on Aireal Phenomena) has proved to the public that the U.S. Air Force has been withholding information concerning UFO's.

We here in Braintree have organized the Flying Saucer Investigation Agency for the purpose of discovering hidden information (hidden by USAF) concerning UFOs and exposing it to the public.

We ourselves have seen a flying saucer and the creatures that occupied it. We know that the saucer may have been a retort to except for its fantastic speed.

This "craft" traveled faster than any jet plane that ever pathed the sky! Upon your request we will send a detailed report.

We hereby pledge to "work" to our greatest extent to eliminate any and all secrecy regarding UFOs.

Sincerely,
[Signature lines are blacked out]
