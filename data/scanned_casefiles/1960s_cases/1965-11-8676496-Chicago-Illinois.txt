Dear Loy;

I'm enclosing a drawing of an object I sighted on November 10, 1965, at 6:10 P.M., which I believe is a flying object as UFO. I first saw it at 6:10 P.M., 500 feet over my roof.

The hull was circular, its glow off a orange metallic glow.

The glow left, its speed a off-gray color, then it spun counter clockwise, took off to the Earth side at a unbelievable, then as if turning on a dime, it went North. This continued until it vanished, about 20 minutes later.

Can you still see why the (United States) with its flight security, can't control whether fully-no to this end? Quite the public isn't told about UFO's. These things are controlled and guided by intel. life. That is doubt, I shall

Dear Sgt:

For enclosing a drawing of a object hovering about 800 feet over my house.

The date and time was: November 10, 1963, 6:10 P.M.

It was circular, gave off a strange metallic glare. It was visible for minute, from a still position, it look off neutrally at a wing speed, turned squarely to the North, stopped and waviled.

Ten minutes later, it reappears in the East, its detail was readable through windows alone, but I checked again through binoculars. What I know was unbelievable. It was like a science fiction scene. Three other people were witnesses to this.

For the purpose of National and State Security, I felt it my duty to report this. Something still

Dear Loy;

I am enclosing a drawing of an object I sited November 15, 1965, at approximately 6:10 P.M. The presence was known for 30 minutes. It would take off with at amazing speed, there was a dome, etc. I held North. It repeated this until it stopped in a instant, then as if by magic, vanished.

I know I saw a "flying saucer". What I want to know - is why this government keeps these under cover? Can you tell me something about what I know? From what I know I could get material on this subject?

Hoping to hear from you soon.

Cordially Yours,
