There 2 objects were moving so very slow, it seemed as if they were stationary at first, they delayed actually the same distance apart & the same size. I watched it for 15 minutes while my son came in the house & called Wright Pattern A.F. B. I surely then one object nearest to the other then went completely out of the other one started gradually & then went completely out.
