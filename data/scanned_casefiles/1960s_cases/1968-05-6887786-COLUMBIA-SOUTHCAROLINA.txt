The only legible text on this page is the number "1" at the bottom right of the document, and a partially visible text that appears to read "7 [something] from the Native" vertically on the left side of the page. The rest of the page appears to be a blank or very faded white/gray document page.


- page 2 -

There is very little legible text on this page. There appears to be a small, partially obscured text fragment at the top left of the document, but it is too blurry and damaged to read with certainty. The rest of the page is mostly blank white space with a few small dots or marks.


- page 3 -

Here is the text from the document:

One includes four (4) 5"x7" photographs
and one (1) 4"x5" negative.

There is also a "SIGNED" stamp in the bottom right corner of the document.
