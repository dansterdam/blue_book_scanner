FLYING OBJECT

Introduction:
On June 17, 1960, [redacted]
c/o New York University, University Heights, New York 53, 
N. Y., submitted a piece of metal for examination. The 
piece of metal was about 1" x 1" by about 0.020" thick 
and appeared to be heavily oxidized on both surfaces.
Prof. Nelson requested a micrograph of the structure 
of the metal and an identification of the nature or 
composition of the metal.

The Sample:
The sample appeared to have one as-rolled 
edge, one adjacent edge-as-cut and the two remaining 
edges as-burned. Approximately one-half of the surface 
on one side was covered with a tight scale that cracked 
off clean on slight bending. Most of the scale was 
black in color but portions contained grey to tan-like 
inclusions

Procedure and Results:
The scale was separated from the metal by 
bending. The remaining metal was cut into two pieces. 
One piece was mounted, polished and etched for metallo-
graphic examination. The remaining piece of metal and 
the scale were subjected to spectrographic analysis.

Figure 1, Plate 1960 - 100X is the structure.
It appears to be coarse-grained heavily oxidized Ferrite.

The results of the spectrographic analyses 
were as follows:

                Metal       Scale
                Lab. #9654  Lab. #9655

Elements checked but not found: Aluminum, 
Zinc, Cadmium, Indium, Vanadium, Tungsten.

Conclusions:
    It appears that the sample represented a 
piece of soft Iron, such as Armco Iron, which had been 
coated with a lead pigmented paint and then heated in 
air or an oxidizing environment to a sealing heat.

Respectfully submitted,

Report of Recovery of Unidentified Object

During my tour as Officer of the Day, 28 May 1960, I was contacted at approximately 1030 via telephone by Bentley, Michigan telephone number. His 16 year old son was plowing with a tractor on their farm, when he noticed a flaming object falling from a Southwesterly direction at an angle of about 75° from the ground. The object landed approximately 5 feet from the tractor and scorched the ground upon impact. No aircraft were visibly or audibly in sight. The object was recovered by John Galain, after it cooled, and was taken to his father. The location of the farm is Standish, Michigan.

I notified Captain Godsey, Base Administrative Officer, who informed me that he would notify Lt. Col. Rollin R. Bullinger, Base Commander, and requested me to contact S/Sgt. ELROD, M. W., EOD for pickup of the item. I contacted Sergeant Elrod, who left the base by Government vehicle at approximately 1130.

Sergeant Elrod returned at approximately 1515 with the object, which was carried by the undersigned for the remainder of the weekend.

The object is metallic, approximately 1 1/8" by 1" square, and blue-black in color. It varies in thickness from approximately 1/64" to 1/16". One edge has the appearance of multiple layers of laminations of metal, covered by an oxide. The base metal is not brittle, as would be a burned portion of exhaust stack or turbine blade.

Recommend the object be forwarded for metallurgical analysis and determination of its source.

Pictures of this object are requested by S/Sgt Elrod for inclosure to his report to Ogden AMA.

It is requested that if any information was to be disseminated as to origin, etc., of this object, he please be notified.
