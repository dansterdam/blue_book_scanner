10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Ball of dark black smoke in front of witness. Was outside. One object behind the other. Witness always outside and saw object upon entering house.

11. COMMENTS
Discussion with witness brought out the fact that when she saw the object their position relative to her head was unchanged even when she moved. Also she was usually emotionally upset prior to sighting. A visit to the doctor brought out the fact that she suffered from high blood pressure. It is opinion of investigator that witness was seeing images due to excess blood in blood vessels of her eyes.


- page 21 -

SUMMARY OF ALLEGED UFO SIGHTING

1. This case was investigated by personnel of the Aerial Phenomena Group.

2. The witness, when interviewed, again described the apparent appearance of the objects and the description was consistent with that reported on the phone during the initial interview. The investigator made a thorough search of the house and surrounding area in an effort to discover anything which could possibly be responsible for the sighting. This search revealed nothing to which the sighting could be attributed.

3. Further discussion with the witness brought out the fact that when she saw the objects their position relative to her head was unchanged even when she moved. When asked if she had any discomforting feelings, other than fear, when she saw the objects the witness replied that she had a burning in her head. Further interrogation brought out that the witness usually was emotionally upset prior to the sighting, and on a large number of occasions was seated outside and experienced the sightings after standing and entering the house. The witness stated that apprehension over her experiences had prompted a visit to the doctor, who diagnosed her case as high blood pressure.

4. It is the opinion of the investigator that the witness was seeing images in to the excess blood which was in the blood vessels of her eyes.
