SIGHTING TO THE INDIANA STATE POLICE AND LATER WAS
ADVISED BY THE POLICE THE OBJECT WAS A B-58 TYPE
AIRCRAFT. B-58 AIRCRAFT WERE AIRBORNE AND IN THE
BUNKER HILL AFB TRAFFIC PATTERN AT THE TIME OF THE
PAGE 4 RUCONJ 50 UNCLAS
SIGHTING, HOWEVER, THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WAS SOUTH OF
THE BASE USING RUNWAY TWO TWO ZERO WITH A LEFT TURN
AFTER TAKE OFF. CONVERSELY, ENROUTE PENETRATIONS ARE
NOT UNCOMMON AND COULD HAVE PLACED ONE OF THE AIRCRAFT
IN THE SIGHTING AREA. ALSO, THE USE OF AFTERBURNERS
OVER ISOLATED AREAS IS PRESCRIBED FOR FUEL WEIGHT
REDUCTION PRIOR TO LANDING. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
INDICATES THE CAUSE OF THE SIGHTING WAS A B-58 AIRCRAFT
USING THE AFTERBURNER JUST PRIOR TO LANDING AT BUNKER
HILL AFB.
