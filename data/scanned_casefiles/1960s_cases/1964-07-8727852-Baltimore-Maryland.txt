Dear Sirs:

Can you tell me what it was we saw move across the sky tonight around 9:30 P.M. moving from the south to the northeast?

I phoned the airport and it was suggested you might be able to tell us.

Thank you very much,

Sincerely yours,

Dear Miss

This is in reply to your letter of July 26, 1964, addressed to NASA, in which you requested information on a satellite which appeared in the Baltimore area on the evening of the 26th.

You observed the passage of ECHO II which traversed the sky over Baltimore at 9:29 p.m. on that date, east of the city, 170 above the horizon, moving northeast.

It is hoped that this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF

Miss
Baltimore 7, Md.
