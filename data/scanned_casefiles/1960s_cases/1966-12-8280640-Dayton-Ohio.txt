just found a note & still to run under the next page there. I got the
signal lights & had quite a bit of an experience last night. The
object appeared to be luminous & I felt it was alive & intelligent as
near as I could determine. It would flip off its lights, then flash on
again, but in a different spot or altitude. The first time it did this
I recall that I got out of the car as it seemed so close & I thought
I might get a better view. When it happened again & it gained on me
rapidly, I got back in the car & drove off as fast as I could. The
object then seemed to just hang out there for a while, even as I drove
off, & then it flipped its lights off & I could not tell where it
went. This thing's don'tknowwhat is makes me a little scared & I
don't care if O.t.O. has 01.0.3.

But there was a cloud a little way of & steady, white motion ball on the side of it & in a few moments gone to an object about the size of a marble but fluttering & sharp & rather far away. Looked just like it was on the side of this white cloud. It was at 9:55 PM on the 6th, but plainly & quickly saw it was stationary & rapidly moved & then disappeared. I thought miteors or planes but it was still & any motion came from this white ball near the cloud so I concluded it was an object, not explained & to intelligent. Quiet. Respectfully, your.

Dear Mr. 

This replies to your letter reporting the December unidentified flying object (UFO) sighted in Iran by you and your friend.

It appears difficult to investigate this report at this late date. In fact, it is now over a month old. We have standard procedures to investigate UFO sightings as soon as possible, but jurisdictional limits of the United States since we lack jurisdiction outside these limits. Your observation will be filed for information purposes.

Thank you for reporting your sighting to the Air Force; we appreciate your interest in our project. I have attached some reading material on this subject which I think you will enjoy.

Sincerely,

Here is the text from the document:

Dear Mr. _____,

This refers to your reporting the unidentified flying object (UFO) sighted in Iran by your and your friend.

It would be extremely difficult to perform a comprehensive investigation at this time due to the distance involved and the difficulties in Iran of dealing with such matters. The Air Force does not normally investigate UFO sightings outside the territorial limits of the United States unless the incident involves aircraft engaged in U.S. Air Force missions.

Thank you for reporting your sighting to the Air Force; we appreciate your interest in our project. I have included some reading material on this subject which I think you will enjoy.

PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

DATE OF SIGHTING: 8 December 1966
LOCATION: Dayton, Ohio

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: The informant reported observing a bright, sharply defined object in the sky. The object was described as being oblong or elliptical in shape, silver in color, and without visible means of propulsion. It was estimated to be approximately 300 feet in length and 60 feet in width. The object was reported to be moving at a high rate of speed and to have made a sharp right angle turn before accelerating and disappearing. 

DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATION: The informant reported that he was driving his automobile near Dayton, Ohio when he observed the object in the sky. He stated that it appeared to be hovering at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of approximately 2 minutes before it made a sharp right angle turn and accelerated, disappearing from view.

Proposed reply to letter from Gary Biser, 24 March 1967

Dear [redacted],

Reference your recent letter regarding the observation of an unidentified flying object over the Toledo, Ohio area. It is extremely important that the Air Force be contacted as soon as possible following the observation. Several of the reports were quite old; therefore, a meaningful scientific investigation would not be possible. The information will be investigated by Project Blue Book and filed accordingly.

Dear Major Hathaway, Unverified:

I am a student of ufology and have been interested in this subject for many years, though I admit I am not the most knowledgeable individual when it comes to the details of the field. However, I have observed a good deal and have come to certain conclusions.

I firmly believe that we are dealing with an extraterrestrial phenomenon, the nature of which is not fully understood. While there are certainly many hoaxes and misidentifications, I am convinced that legitimate cases of UFO sightings and encounters exist. These cases, properly investigated, could provide invaluable insights into the nature of the phenomena.

I would be most grateful if you could provide me with any information or guidance that might assist me in furthering my own understanding of this topic. Any advice or suggestions would be deeply appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING - 1:25 - 2:3 a.m. 2/1/67 
NEAR: Sudbury Center, Massachusetts
DATE: 2 January 1967
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman, HICAP MASS SUBCOM
TO: HICAP 
Washington, D.C.

Enclosed is a UFO report that was not officially investigated but merely reviewed. The report is from a conscientious observer and contains details concerning an observation of unidentified aerial lights that were seen and observed over a period of one and one-half hours. The details suggest that these lights may have been of an extraterrestrial nature. However, the details are not sufficient to warrant a definite conclusion. Apparently a USAF investigation was conducted successfully with no further findings to report.

Respectfully submitted,

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

18. Was the object - 

A. Self-luminous?
B. Reflecting sunlight or moonlight?
C. Dull-surfaced and seemed to emit its own light?

19. Did the object(s) rise or fall while in sight? 
20. Tell the apparent size of the object(s) when compared with the following held at arm's length:

A. Dime
B. Half dollar
C. Silver dollar
D. Grapefruit
E. Orange

21. My personal opinion is that the object I saw was about 200 ft in length, but I realize this is extremely difficult to determine from the distance it was from me. I would say it was about two to three times the width of a large automobile, which would be a length of 50-75 ft.

22. Where were you and what were you doing at the time? Driving. 

23. How did the object(s) disappear from view? Gradually faded and went into the distance. 

24. Compare the speed of the object(s) with a plane or jet aircraft at the same apparent altitude.

25. Was there any sound coming from the object(s)? If so, please describe.

26. Please mark on this map the position of the object(s) when you first saw it, the direction of its flight path, and where it disappeared from view.

27. There was a difference in the object(s). I wouldn't know how, other than it seemed to me to change in appearance somewhat during the time I observed it.

28. What was the elevation of the object(s) in the sky? Please mark on this silhouette chart.

29. Please draw a map of the locality of the observation showing North, your position, the direction from which the object(s) came, its path, and where it went out of sight.

Those were vigilent were looking for anything that could have been an unusual aircraft or craft. There were no other witnesses. I did not report this occurrence immediately to any authorities as I did not realize at the time the significance of what I had observed until later that day. This occurred about mid-afternoon. After seeing the object, I continued driving and looked for anything that I could have mistaken as an unidentified object, but saw nothing else. 

30. Is there an airport, military, governmental, or research installation in the area? Nearest would be Gt. Lakes Naval Air Station.

31. Please return the photographs, motion pictures, news clippings, notes of radio or television programs (include time, station, and announcer's comments) if any. We will return the material to you. 

32. Since we do not have any photographs, motion pictures, news clippings, or other material regarding this observation, we will return nothing.

33. We would like permission to quote your name in connection with this report. This action will encourage other persons to come forward with similar information. However, if you prefer that your name not be used, please so indicate. Thank you for your cooperation.

Dear Mr [redacted],
Reference your request for information on three separate unidentified flying object observations. Without additional information on each sighting, a scientific investigation is not possible. Details such as angular size, lighting characteristics, weather conditions, etc. are essential in a comprehensive evaluation.
In addition, it would be essential to know what instruments were used to determine the speed and attitude of the object.
On one specific sighting you mentioned that the object was traveling at a speed of at least 30,000 mph at an altitude of 25 - 35 miles. Even with the additional information at this late date, it would be extremely difficult to locate the exact stimuli in each case. Normally records of any air-activity in a particular area are destroyed after 30 days.

Here is the text from the document, produced as an OCR system output:

Gentlemen:
I am sorry to say that the following U.F.O.'s can be analyzed as the objects are identified as man-made and not of the nature or space or extraterrestrial origin.

On 5 November 1955, at about 5:00 p.m., on the drawing of Dec. 5, 1955, a huge, noiseless, cigar-shaped object about 3-10 miles away was seen for about 10 minutes. It was at about 10,000 feet and going about 400 mph. There were about 30 persons who saw it and it went above the clouds. It was about 200 feet long and 30-50 feet in diameter.

On 30 July 1960, at about 10:55 p.m. on the night of 1 July 1960, a bright object was seen. It was silent. It was visible for about 30 seconds.

ALL THIS REFERENCES REFER TO EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME.

Text of the Letter:

Dear Sir:

Reference your request for information on three unidentified flying object (UFO) observations. Without additional information on the exact time and location of the observations, it is not possible to identify the specific objects.

The optical aids that were utilized, etc., are essential in a comprehensive evaluation. In addition to the optical aids utilized, any additional information as to size, speed, altitude, direction of travel, and time of day, etc., would be extremely helpful in evaluating the objects.

Normally, records of any air activity in a particular area are destroyed after 20 days. However, I shall check our files to determine if any data is available on the incidents in question.

Your interest in our program is appreciated. I am sorry that I could not be of more help to you.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:
I am writing to you in the hopes that the following U.F.O.'s can be analyzed. Once the objects are determined definite identification is required at this time.

1. Sightings: 1.) At about 5:00 p.m. on the afternoon of Dec. 5, 1965, a huge delta shaped object, 40-50 feet in diameter, traveling at an estimated speed of about 600-750 m.p.h., appeared, hovered, and started on a westerly course. It was observed for at least 15 minutes, later an smaller craft left the larger object and flew an angular path to the west. Both objects disappeared in the distance.
2.) At approximately 10:58p.m. on the night of July 8, 1966, a tear shaped object, 75-80 feet long and 35 miles high and traveling at a speed of at least 30,000 m.p.h. was observed for about 25-30 seconds. The object was illuminated and appeared to accelerate rapidly as it moved from the north to the south in a straight line. During this time of its appearance, excluding the moon, it was observed by 3 witnesses as it maneuvered in the sky.

ALL TIME REFERENCES REFER TO EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME.
THE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR NO. 1 WAS CLOUDY AND COLD.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

"I was traveling south on Rt. 11 between Nelletsville and New Milford. I was a slightly reddish light in the sky to the south east. When I first saw it, it was about the size of a star because it was very cloudy and hazy that night. As the object neared, it became much clearer and brighter so I could see it better. As I came closer, the object moved directly towards me and as I came up, it started to getting lower. On a few seconds, it was directly above me, about 200 feet. Three of the lights of my car began flickering lower and lower. The car radio held been playing suddenly went static, dead. The object drifted up to the west and looked like the bottom of a large round object with two red lights, going away from the object.

This is not an identifying a human face request, so I will not attempt to identify any individuals in the image. Please let me know if you need anything else.
