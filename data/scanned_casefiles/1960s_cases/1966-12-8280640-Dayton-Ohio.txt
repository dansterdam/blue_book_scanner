I first saw the object on my way home from work. I work special delivery mail for the Post Office as a messenger. I work nights and am constantly on the roads at night. When I first observed object it looked like a light flashing either on a plane or high radio station antenna. But as I approached, object was stationary and not moving. Lights were just rotating red and white. I slow proceeded the few yards and flag down 2 automobiles to confirm what I was seeing. Needless to say no one would stop. I then reached an intersection and pulled out a flash light and spotted my direction of object and still intent. Object moved

Dear [redacted]

This replies to your letter reporting the December unidentified flying object (UFO) sighted in Iran by you and your friend.

It would be extremely difficult to perform a comprehensive investigation at this late date. In fact, it is extremely difficult to investigate a sighting which is more than a month old. Also, we do not normally investigate UFO sightings outside the territorial limits of the United States since we lack jurisdiction outside those limits. Your observation will be filed for information purposes.

Thank you for reporting your sighting to the Air Force; we appreciate your interest in our project. I have attached some reading material on this subject which I think you will enjoy.

At the bottom of the page, there appears to be a small hand-drawn diagram or sketch, but the details are not clear enough to describe precisely.

At the top of the document, there is a French text that translates to: "The aerogramme must not contain any object"

The document appears to be an aerogramme (a type of airmail letter) with some text in French and what seems to be Arabic or another script. Most of the specific details are obscured or illegible.

Proposed reply to letter from Gary Sieja, 24 March 1967

Dear [redacted]

Reference your recent letter regarding the observation of an unidentified flying object over the Toledo, Ohio area. It is extremely important that the Air Force be contacted as soon as possible following the observation. Several of the reports were quite old; therefore, a meaningful scientific investigation would not be possible. The information will be investigated by Project Blue Book analysts and filed accordingly.

Dear Maj. Huth, Individually,

I am a student of Woodward High School, and I investigate reports of U.F.O's in my local area. These reports are the reports from reliable students who which they see some mysterious unusual air to sky. These are the reports in this envelope. They are of some complete photo for well. Please send me if you will the information sheet so I can give them something well permit them here to -

NICAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SUBCOMMITTEE
13 Friend Court
Wenham, Massachusetts

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING - Rt. #25 2-3 mi. before Middleboro Center,
Massachusetts exit - 12/1/66

DATE: 2 January 1967

FROM: Raymond E. Fowler -- 
Chairman, NICAP MASS SUBCOM

TO: NICAP
Washington, D.C.

Enclosed is a UFO report that was not personally investigated
but was nevertheless worthy of statistical information
on the rash of UFO sightings from that general area. Re: newsclips
on seemingly occasional close sightings at Warren and Onset,
Massachusetts in early November. Attempts to investigate personally
were to no avail as the witnesses wanted to remain anonymous.
Apparently a known USAF investigator was partially successful as
the witnesses agreed to call to USAF investigators by phone from
nearby Otis AFB. The enclosed report involves a glowing band of
light in the sky. No structural detail was positively seen and
as far as known there were no other witnesses. I talked to
Mrs. Hathaway on the phone. She is an amateur artist and feels
quite certain that her detailed personal interview warrants
her name kept confidential for fear of being bothered by crank
callers. Since a full-scale investigation was not warranted due
to the nature of the sighting (light-in-sky report with no unusual
features), no evaluation has been made. The report may become
valuable if other sightings of a better quality are submitted
that date and location.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler (Chairman)

Proposed reply to letter from

Dear Mr.

Reference your request for information on three separate unidentified flying object observations. Without additional information on each sighting, a scientific investigation is not possible. Details such as angular size, lighting characteristics, whether optical aids were utilized, etc. are essential in a comprehensive evaluation.

In addition, it would be essential to know what instruments were used to determine the speed and altitude of the object.

On one specific sighting you mentioned that the object was traveling at a speed of at least 30,000 mph at an altitude of 25 - 35 miles. Even with the additional information at this late date, it would be extremely difficult to locate the exact stimuli in each case. Normally records of any aircactivity in a particular area are destroyed after 30 days.

Gentlemen:

Am ten times more you in the hope that the following U.F.O.'s can be analyzed. Once two objects are identified, or remain unidentified, please write to me concerning each.

YOURS SINCERELY,

1.) At about 5:00 p.m. on the afternoon of Dec. 5, 1965, a huge bright, white shape of an object was observed on a course at about 2-10 thousand m.p.h. After about 10 seconds of observation the object stopped, hovered, and then continued on a northerly course. It was observed for about 30 seconds, and it went above the clouds. Its height was about 200 feet, and the object was a brilliant white in performance of any conventional aircraft.

2.) At about 10:53 p.m. on the night of July 1, 1966, a tear shaped object was sighted traveling on a south to course, 35 miles high, and traveling at a speed of at least 30,000 miles an hour. It was visible for about 3 seconds or less.

3.) On Aug. 14, 1966 at 11:30 p.m. an object was seen traveling in a west to east direction. The object was traveling at the time of its appearance excluding the moon. It zig-zagged many times before going out of sight 3 minutes later.

ALL THE REFERENCES REPORT TO EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.

THE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR NO. 1 WAS CLOUDY, AND COLD.

THE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR NO. 2-3 WAS CLEAR & WARM -- TEMPERATURE ABOUT 65-70 DEGREES.

Gentlemen:
I AM contacting you in the hopes that the following U.F.O.'s can be analyzed. Once to me concerning each.

Sightings: 1.) At about 5:00 p.m., on the afternoon of Dec. 5, 1965, a huge triangular shaped object was observed. It was first observed on an easterly course at about 2-10 thousand m.p.h. After about 10 seconds of observation the object stopped dead and started on a westerly course. It was observed for about 30 seconds and it went above the clouds. Its height was about 200 feet. The object was silent------the object defied the performance of any conventional aircraft.

2.) At about 10:59 a.m. on the night of July 1, 1966, a tear shaped object was sighted traveling on a south to course. The object was about 25-35 miles high, and traveling at a speed of at least 30,000 mph. The object was silent. It was visible for about 3 seconds or less.

3.) On Aug. 4, 1966, at 11:30 p.m. an object was seen traveling in a westerly direction. The object was at the same altitude as the moon. At the time of its appearance excluding the moon, it zig-zagged many times before going out of sight 3 minutes later.

ALL THE REFERENCES REFER TO EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.

[Left Column]
34. Date you completed this questionnaire: SAT. FEB 19 1964

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

My college roommate and myself were returning from the painting of our school news photo etc. waited till light while driving. My friend was driving and it kept it to myself, after about 1 minute it told my roommate that we stopped the car. We observed the object as it moved, very put across the sky. At first we thought it was a plane, until it stopped past clean-cut direction.

We watched it for about 10 minutes. It started moving and at a relatively present speed. It then picked up speed and slowed to glow + flash lightly.

[Right Column]
It disappeared over the horizon and we drove back to school, telling only one friend who is a local defense man. And who has since then set up a telephone 338 pause on the roof of our dorm.

Thank you for your time.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or in a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I was traveling south on R. 11
between Hatfield and New Milford
when I saw a bright red light
in the sky to the south-east.

I knew it wasn't a star because
it was very cloudy and less than
an hour later a heavy snowfall
began. I knew it wasn't a plane
because it wasn't moving and the
light was much brighter and bright-
er as it came closer. The object
moved directly over the road and
as I came closer, it still kept
getting lower. In a few seconds
it was directly above me, then
twice the height of my car.

The car radio had been playing
suddenly it went silent. I could
hear nothing but the car motor.
I stopped the car and looked
up closely with the bottom of a
large would object with two red

I sat there for a minute more
staring up at it. It was no
height that just above the
telephone poles.

I drove quickly away. I
went about one mile and
decided for my own peace of
mind I had to go back. I
turned around and went back.
Just as it came I saw bright
air started to rise back up
in the air and in less
than a second it was at a
ridge of hills. The red light
was still bright but while
dark the outline was not
visible. The light did not
fade away. It was rather
turned off or the object disappear-
ed. It was bright and suddenly
was no longer there.

The radio resumed playing
as soon as I was a few feet
away from the object.

You will tell everybody. But I can
do it again you believe me.
