11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer has reported numerous observations of alleged UFOs over the area. The descriptions have varied as have the time(duration) of the sighting. Aircraft are believed responsible for the majority of the sightings. We, Observer has reported four UFO sightings since 29 March 66.

Contact was made by investigating officer with a local newspaperman and it was learned that said observer is reported to be unreliable.

Information received was a very poor quality. To further information is necessary before a definite conclusion can be reached; however, the case in question does not warrant such additional investigation.

Here is the text from the document:

April 18, 1966

FTD-TDEW-UFO
Wright Patterson
Air Force Base
Dayton Ohio 45433

Dear Sirs:

This letter is no regards to the Telephone Call that we received from Lt Campbelle and Sgt Schultz of West Hampton Suffolk Air Force Base April 18 at 8:30 P.m.

We do not wish to put our name on a blank piece of paper - unless we know what are names are being used for and why.

We had been willing to use are name and to tell what we saw on March 30,1966 - But we do not know why you want are names. So until we do we say nothing.

I understand from a Telephone Call that Their is to be a Reporter from the Journal American at Hle [partially obscured]. Please give him any information pertaining to the March 30,1966 Sighting.

Mr. Mrs.
East Hampton, L.I. N.Y.
11937

[Note: Some text is obscured or blacked out, particularly names and contact information]

Sighting 30 March 1966

and Mrs & Mr. sighting of UFO.

Report by Lt Campbell at Suffolk AFB was forwarded to Dayton on April 8 - 9 1966 (East Hampton, Long Island (N.Y.S))

writer for the New York Journal of America has requested copies of the two peoples reports above. Before I can release the reports to him I want to know if the witnesses want it released to him. If the witnesses do not wish their names and reports released to Mr. request a letter signed by the above witnesses be sent to us stating so. If they can be released, request a letter signed by the above witnesses be sent to us stating so. Request Lt. Campbell prepared the letters and contact the witnesses at once.

Inform Lt Campbell that there is some confusion in the data. Message indicates that Spicer observed object on 30 March 66 plus observation of 7 Apr 66. Your twx of 9 Apr 66 states under paragraph k saw something 30 Mar 66 (0345Z) and reported it to us. After checking with 52 FW Operations, we had no acft flying in that area at this time: However, these eleven people heard jet acft. Also, Discussion with Easthampton Patrolman Paul J. Green Wood revealed same facts

1. Spicer's report of 30 Mar - What was it?
2. TWX is combining two reports - Need separation.
3. Did 11 people see observation of 30 March or did 11 people see observation of 7 Apr 66.
4. Does the hearing of the jet aircraft apply to 30 Mar sighting or 7 Apr 66

REPORTS SHOULD BE SENT TO FTD (TDEW/UFO), W-P AFB, NOT AFSC ANDREWS AFB, (OVER)

Paragraph K. Comets of Preparing Officer have been confusing and vague. The majority of reports have been f saying - Probable cause of sighting unknown unless influenced by publicity received by UFO recently. Paragraph 16 of AFR 200-2 says:

The preparing officer will make a preliminary analysis and a comment on the possible cause or identity of the object he is reporting, together with a statement supporting his comment and analysis. He will make every effort to obtain pertinent items of information and to test all possible leads, clues, and hypotheses concerning the identity or explanation of the sighting.

Saucer Is Reported
At Napeague Beach

Wednesday night, March 30, was
Bruce Field of 82 Collins Avenue,
East Hampton, was driving his new
truck home from Montauk. At Napeague, near
Mackay radio towers, his engine
suddenly went dead, his lights went
out, and his horn wouldn't blow.

He threw up the hood and began
to tinker, when, equally suddenly,
the lights went back on. He got
back in and found the horn worked
and the engine started.

Within minutes, the same electrical cut-out occurred again. This
time, as he was tinkering under the
hood, he noticed lights along the
ocean beach and figured a beach
buggy was going along eastward,
more or less parallel with him.

But the light veered offshore and
then returned. As it moved slowly
over his head to the radio towers,
it shone — the most brilliant white
light Mr. Field says he has ever
seen — and its shape was that of a
torpedo. He judged it to be between
50 and 75 feet long, and about 700
feet overhead.

At the towers, the object suddenly took off "faster than a jet,"
it seemed, towards Gardiner's Island
and beyond, to Fisher's Island. It
did he see a car, until he passed
the Devon turn at Amagansett, as
he rushed to Town Police headquarters to tell his story.

Three Mile Harbor
Five minutes before Mr. Field
entered the station at 10:15 p.m.
Dallas Spicer of Abraham's Path
near Three Mile Harbor Road had
finally called the police about having seen, together with his wife,
"a very funny light just over the
telephone pole" at the road near
their house. It was pale blue, and
it made the pole cast a shadow,
which moved left and right as the
light itself moved to and fro.

Mrs. Spicer had phoned the police
a moment later to say that the light
was "very bright, and it is not a
star."

At 10:45, Mrs. Spicer called
second time, to report that the light
"got very bright and was leaving
the area just over the trees, towards
East Hampton." And a few moments
later she called to say that "the object" was over the Hampton Cable-
vision television tower — large and
glowing brightly.

After the Spicer's first call, Sergeant Russell Sanders went to the
area, but he called in to say that
he had not seen "the same."

NICAP
Seymour Becker, chief of radiation control in the Suffolk County
Department of Health in Riverhead,
had heard on the radio later that
an Unidentified Flying Object had
been sighted. He called the East
Hampton Town police and asked for
a report. Mr. Becker is also a special
investigator a private, national wide organization called the National Investigators Committee on
Aerial Phenomena (NICAP).

The Spicers had called Mrs. Roy
Lester of Amagansett, also a member of NICAP. She went to see
them that very evening, and on
the following evening Mr. Becker
met with the Spicers and Mr. Field
at Mrs. Lester's house. A detailed
report will be filed with NICAP at
its Washington headquarters.

The Spicers told Mrs. Lester that
their experience had begun at 9 p.m.
that evening, with violent radio
static. As he went outside to the
garage to fetch a static filter, Mr.
Spicer saw the blue light. He and Mrs. Spicer watched it
for some time, as it brightened and
dimmed alternately, then...

Dear Captain:

I wish to thank you and Lt. W. Campbell, for a very interesting and informative visit extended to me on August 2, 1966.

Enclosed is a report and newspaper clippings regarding the May 30, April 7, 1966, and other outstanding U.F.O. observations as you requested.

Very truly yours,

across the sky, stopping just under
the moon. All the neighborhood
dogs were barking, and their own
pony was raising a fuss in its stall.
When Sgt. Sanders arrived, it had
faded.

Black Bulk

The Spicers were upset, and a
little later Mr. Spicer drove up
Abraham's Path toward the television antenna tower. He then saw a
black bulk in the sky, a silhouette,
he told the police, which flashed
light upwards and started to move.
He headed homeward, seemingly followed by the object, so he
drove on to the Town dock on Three
Mile Harbor Road. The shape circled over the water and headed toward East Hampton. It seemed
oval and had a yellowish, reddish
tinge by that time, he told Mrs.
Lester.

What shall we call it? Swamp
gas? (Over the beach at Napeague?)
A shooting star? (Do they usually
change direction?) A hallucination?

then at Abraham's Path?) A UFO?
A Whatchamacallit?

Wednesday night, March 30, was
such a night as to create electrical
disturbances in the atmosphere. But,
whatever you choose to name it,
the Spicers and Mr. Field had an
altogether eerie experience that
night, and one they would rather
not repeat.

EAST HAMPTON STAR
10¢

East Hampton Town's reputation as the unidentified flying object capital of the Northeast, or perhaps of Suffolk County, continues untarnished. Last Thursday evening, just eight days after the initial sightings last week, residents of the Abraham's Path area again observed strange lights in the sky.

This time, they were joined in their observations by a veteran and unexcitable member of the Town Police Force. The Abraham's Path lights, in their second sighting, did not this time coincide with a view of a torpedo-shaped object of the sort seen at Napeague Beach March 30.

The latest episode began at 8:04 p.m. April 7, when Mrs. Dallas Spicer of 37A Abraham's Path, near Three Mile Harbor, reported seeing an unidentified flying object. Mr. and Mrs. Spicer had 'reported overhead lights near the telephone poles there March 30.

Rising In West
Patrolman Paul Greenwood and Sergeant Russell Sanders were dispatched to the scene, and were told by the Spicers that they had observed a light rising in the west, fairly rapidly, and that it had halted high in the sky to the northeast.

Patrolman Greenwood said later that he then observed it himself, "like the brightest planet." Sergeant Sanders was noncommittal.

The Patrolman braced against the patrol car, observing the object glowing high in the sky. After a while, he said, it appeared to move in a figure-eight pattern, its motion apparent against nearby fixed stars.

Mr. and Mrs. David Webb of East Hampton Knolls, Patrolman Greenwood reported, arrived with a pair of binoculars. He said they stated that they had seen the object from their home earlier.

present the sighting of the night, as
rolman Greenwood said, the light
would fade. He flashed a powerful
searchlight toward the object.

Some of the growing crowd at
the scene, he said, reported seeing
the object blink in reply, blink for
blink. "I couldn't tell," he said, "because of the glare of the light against
my eyes."

The witnesses included Mrs. Edwin Bennett, Nina Smith, Viola
Madison, Benjamin Coleman, and
Mr. and Mrs. Roy K. Lester.

Mrs. Lester reported to the Town
Police yesterday morning that two
