Now imagine you are at the center of the compass rose. Place an "A" on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when first seen. Place an "A" on the compass to indicate the phenomenon when last seen.

In the sketch below, place an "A" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "B" at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. Connect the "A" and "B" with a line to approximate the movement of the phenomenon between "A" and "B". That is, schematically show whether the movement appears to be straight, curved, or zig-zag. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
