UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location E. of Kyushu Island, Japan

Date 11 August 1960     Hour (Z) 11307

WX Unfiltered

Description From ball of light with silent fluorescent trail following course of earth. Object estimated to be 50 miles in front of earth traveling on course of 150 deg. One obs estimated speed of obj at several thousand M/H. Object viewed for 3 to 4 seconds.

Direction of Motion SSE

Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219)     None reported to be reorienting at this time.

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): prob meteor

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1):     None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc):     ------

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.:     Ruled out

Other:     [blank]

Evaluation of Source Reliability:     Prob reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: Here were no satellite observations to be considered. Air traffic control, Kir AFKWKWKK and the trajectory and speed can be explained as that of an extreme bright meteor. The extreme light speed is meteoric speed, such as list of an astronomical object. The description is characteristic of a meteor passing through the earth's atmosphere.
