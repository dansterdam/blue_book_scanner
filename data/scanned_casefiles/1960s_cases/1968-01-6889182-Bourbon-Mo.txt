15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

At this particular morning - moving view the white light like a large star, that turns and moved/changed. The lights that would help to see more not change.

[A hand-drawn sketch is included showing some objects/points]

Own view now window is the mill of the house. I looked north and a little west. Definitely went north west.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

They is what I say so they can write down. Visited little more than it might be. Definitely approximately. It looked little and with the jagged other-year view.

MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL

Cuba, Missouri
March 7, 1967

Subject: Report of unidentified flying objects, Crawford County, Missouri

To: Commanding Officer, Troop I
Missouri State Highway Patrol
Rolla, Missouri

1. On March 5, 1967, Troop I Rolla advised reporting officer that they had received a letter from a Mrs. who lives about two and one-half miles northwest of Bourbon, Missouri. She stated in the letter that she had been seeing lights in the woods behind her house and across the road and she seemed to think that they were unidentified flying objects.

2. Reporting officer contacted Mrs. in the afternoon of March 5, 1967, and she talked for sometime about the lights. She showed this officer where they had been seen and just what they did. She stated the first time she saw them they landed in the woods behind her house. She stated that there was one about the size of a dinner plate and after the one landed several smaller ones would leave it. The small ones were about the size of a baseball. The small ones would then go back to the large one and they would leave. The first time they were seen was February 8, 1967, and she stated she had seen them almost every night since. She also stated that several other people had seen them, including the children of who live directly behind her. This officer contacted those people and talked with the six children ranging from five to seven years old. They stated they were carrying out some trash one afternoon late and saw this object about the size of a car coming towards them out of the sky. They all dropped their trash and ran into the house. They have not seen any more.

3. The night of March 6, 1967, this officer went back to the home of Mrs. and observed the area for about two hours. During this time officer observed eight airplanes, all flying from east to west over what to east. They have flashing red, green and white lights. Mrs. pointed to one and said, "There is one now."

4. It is the opinion of this officer that Mrs. lives in a slight patch and what she is seeing is airplanes. When the airplanes are on some distance, they appear to be coming through the woods. Mrs. is getting up years and since she has been watching this for so long, this officer feels that her imagination is contributing to some of the things she sees.

I apologize, but the text in this image appears to be handwritten in a cursive or script style that is largely illegible to me. While I can see that the document is written in what seems to be English, the handwriting is too difficult to confidently transcribe. There are some small hand-drawn diagrams or sketches near the bottom of the page, including what looks like a simple UFO or disk-like shape, but I cannot reliably read the surrounding text.
