11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a round yellowed colored object travel toward the south. The object was about the size of a dime held at arm's length. The observer first noticed a steady yellow light in the SW. This light slowly moved toward the south and disappeared rapidly in that direction.

The description is consistent with that of a satellite observation. Care of the Pegasus satellite could have been responsible for the sighting.
