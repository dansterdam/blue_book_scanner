There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a sketch of a compass with various directions and angles labeled. The text on the page instructs the observer to imagine a scenario and draw a picture to show the motion of the object, and also asks about the presence of multiple objects and the direction they were traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
