The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved, object-like shape in the sky, with the instructions to place an "A" on the curve to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when first seen, and a "B" to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape view, with a person standing on a road in the foreground, and buildings or houses in the background on either side of the road.

Project Blue Book OCR Output:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this.

Dear SIr:
I have been seeing things and need help to explain them. 
Local air personnel know nothing of them, or they fear to speak of them.
They cannot identity the many lights I have seen, but is the most outstanding is the fury of a red light fast ball meteor like object, of tremendous speed and size, that shoots across the sky in short intervals of from one to three seconds, going straight up, straight down, zigzagging, and a flash of light.
It sometimes turns dark then flashes a brilliant ruby red. It stops suddenly, hovers for a few seconds, then suddenly takes off again in a terrific burst of speed. 
This I have seen on many occasions at night and in the day. Also large dark shadow forms, that dart across the sky at tremendous speed, when coming towards one, they suddenly vanish.
I am alone in this, it seems tha rest of the world is either blind or unconcerned.
I shall be most grateful if you can throw some light on this, and tell me if this is real or just my imagination. I fear I am going stale.
I have recently taken up farming again, as I was at one time, but this worry of what I se4e is like a heavy weight on my mind.
If you or any of your staff have ever heard of similar reports I would appreciate hearing from you.
Very truly yours,

Text extracted from the document:

Dear Mr. ______,

Thank you please return the enclosed form and return it evaluating the additional information on the form would provide.

1. How was the 25 second time determined?
2. Was the duration of the sighting the same for all sightings?
3. Could you indicate the number of times the object was observed to rise?

Your cooperation is appreciated and will aid immensely in the evaluation of your sighting.

When considering the possibility of a sighting being a satellite, please consider the angle at the same angle when moving South to North, and the supplementary angle when moving North to South. This serves to point up the true nature of the observation.

Thank you for your effort and interest.

Sincerely,

20. Drave a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, or "F" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object such as a tree or building and estimate how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you have performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
