Dear Sir:

I have been seeing things and need help to tell what they are. I've tried N. A. S. A. but get no reply. Local air personnel know nothing of them, or it, and I fear they think I may be imagining things.

Tuesday night last at app. 10:16 P.M. this thing appeared out of the southwest, going toward the northeast. One imagined a dark spot going over (it passed almost directly overhead) but it may have been because of a mercury-white blinker. This light would be blinding at close range and blinked on and off about twice a second.

It was high but did not seem to have the altitude say of the R. T. record cross the sky in any 25 seconds. It was soundless, and we hear jets 35,000 feet up. Also it moved at a great several times the speed of jets.

Wednesday it went over at app. 10:30, give or take a minute. The course was same west to east. The blinker was as bright, as ever. Thursday it went over at 10:14, but it was then going on an east to west course. About 300 past the zenith the blinker suddenly quit. Last night it was not seen.

If not a U. S. satellite, is this the Russian offer with three men on orbit? Did they bring them back alive? Will the Russians have their space station up soon. Are we making any plans along that line. If not, why. It appears to me that the nation with the first space station will militarily control the world. What are your views.

Very truly,

[Signature is blacked out]

26 July 1962

1. Reference the attached copy of a letter to General Bernard Schriever from Mr. [redacted] questionnaire on a UFO sighted by the writer. Mr. [redacted] letter does not contain sufficient information to allow a reliable conclusion. It is suggested that a new Form 164, July 1961, be forwarded to Mr. [redacted] with instructions to complete and return it directly to the Foreign Technology Division.

2. In addition to the questions on the form, it is desirable that Mr. [redacted] provide answers to the following:
   a. How was the 25 second time duration determined?
   b. Was the duration the same for all sightings?
   c. What was the approximate number of times the object was observed to flash?

3. It is suggested that you inform Mr. [redacted] that factors such as altitude of the aircraft, wind direction, direction in which the aircraft is moving, temperature, humidity, etc., which could be bearing on what is happening, whether or not noise from an aircraft can be heard and that certain other pertinent factors of the same nature, such as when moving south to north and the supplement of that angle when moving north to south, and given parallax at angles that are not supplementary is not a satellite.

July 31, 1962

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Will you please fill out the enclosed form and return it for evaluation? In addition to the questions on the form would you please provide us answers to the following:

1. How was the 25 second time determined?
2. Was the duration the same for all sightings?
3. What was the approximate number of times the object was observed to flash?

Your cooperation will be appreciated and will aid immensely in the evaluation of your sighting.

Many factors such as altitude, direction of movement as related to wind direction, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, background noise, etc., all have a direct bearing on whether or not noise from an aircraft can be heard.

When considering the possibility of a sighting being a satellite, one must remember that satellites cross specific parallels of latitude at the same angle when moving South to North, and the supplement of that angle when moving North to South. This serves to point up the necessity for accurate tracking.

Thank you for your effort and interest.
Sincerely,

G. R. HART
