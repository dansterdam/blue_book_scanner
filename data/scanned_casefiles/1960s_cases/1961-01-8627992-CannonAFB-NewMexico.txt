9. COMMENTS
Witnesses were sitting in an auto, and whether it was a convertible or hard top would determine the height they could see as high above the horizon as was reported. Planet Venus was in approx position reported. Key witnesses reported probably due to clouds or atmospheric effects. Object was reported to have moved toward N, which coincides with movement of planet during its apparent descent toward the horizon.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Sphere-shaped object, size of dime at arm's length. White changed to dull red. Appeared NW 45° above horizon. Disappeared NW 30° above horizon. Moved slowly at first, then horizontal to left, then up increasing speed, then angled down to the right toward the horizon. Size of the object did not appear to vary in its descent.

UNCLAS AD/DOI 22-102 ATTN: AFCIN 462X. THIS IS IN
TWO PARTS. PART I. IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION: A. DETERMINATION THAT THE OBJECT MOVED STRAIGHT DOWN WAS MADE BY THE
RELATION OF THE FLIGHT PATH TO AN OUTDOOR MOVIE SCREEN. THE
SIZE OF THE OBJECT DID NOT APPEAR TO VARY AS IT DESCENDED. B.
OBJECT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW WHEN ITS FLIGHT PATH DESCENDED
BEHIND THE MOVIE SCREEN. PERIOD OF OBSERVATION WAS FROM 10
TO 20 SECONDS. PART II. THREE PERSONS WERE IN THE CAR AT
THE TIME OF OBSERVATION. THE FIRST WITNESS, AN AIR POLICE
AIRMAN, WAS THE SOURCE OF THE ORIGINAL REPORT.

INTERROGATION OF THE SECOND WITNESS REVEALED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME INFORMATION REPORTED BY THE FIRST WITNESS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE OBJECT'S COLOR. THE SECOND WITNESS DESCRIBED OBJECT'S COLOR FIRST AS PINK, THEN TURNING A BRIGHT RED. THE THIRD PERSON IN THE CAR REQUIRED GLASSES TO SEE, BUT WAS NOT WEARING THEM AND DID NOT OBSERVE THE OBJECT.

A COMPLETE REPORT OF THE SECOND WITNESS INTERROGATION WILL BE FORWARDED UPON REQUEST. HOWEVER, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR TWO OBSERVATIONS WAS ON THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT.
