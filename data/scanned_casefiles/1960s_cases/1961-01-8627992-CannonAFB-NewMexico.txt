UNCLAS AD/DOI 52-102 ATTN: AFCIN 4E2X. THIS IS IN
TWO PARTS. PART I. IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION: A. DETERMINATION THAT THE OBJECT MOVED STRAIGHT DOWN WAS MADE BY THE
RELATION OF THE FLIGHT PATH TO AN OUTDOOR MOVIE SCREEN. THE
SIZE OF THE OBJECT DID NOT APPEAR TO VARY AS IT DESCENDED. B.
OBJECT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW WHEN ITS FLIGHT PATH DESCENDED
BEHIND THE MOVIE SCREEN. PERIOD OF OBSERVATION WAS FROM 12
TO 22 SECONDS. PART II. THREE PERSONS WERE IN THE CAR AT
THE TIME OF OBSERVATION. THE FIRST WITNESS, AN AIR POLICE
AIRMAN, WAS THE SOURCE OF THE ORIGINAL REPORT.

INTERROGATION OF THE SECOND WITNESS REVEAL-
ED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME INFORMATION REPORTED BY THE FIRST WIT-
NESS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE OBJECT'S COLOR. THE SECOND
WITNESS DESCRIBED OBJECT'S COLOR FIRST AS PINK, THEN TURNING A
BRIGHT RED. THE THIRD PERSON IN THE CAR REQUIRED GLASSES TO
SEE, BUT WAS NOT WEARING THEM AND DID NOT OBSERVE THE OBJECT.
A COMPLETE REPORT OF THE SECOND WITNESS INTERROGATION WILL BE
FORWARDED UPON RECEIPT, HOWEVER, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR
TWO OBSERVATIONS WAS ON THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT.
