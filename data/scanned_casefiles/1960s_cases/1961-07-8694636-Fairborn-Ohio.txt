Evaluation of Source Reliability: POOR, GOOD
Analysis and Conclusions: THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS OBSERVED BY THE WITNESS WERE MOST LIKELY AIRCRAFT RETURNING TO DAYTON AFB OR OTHER BASES IN THE AREA. THERE ARE SEVERAL LIGHTED AIRFIELDS IN THE AREA AND AIRCRAFT RETURNING FROM VARIOUS MISSIONS FOR LANDING IS COMMON. THE WITNESS WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT OR DISTINGUISH THEM FROM NORMAL AIRFIELD TRAFFIC. THIS WAS THE PROBABLE EXPLANATION IN THIS CASE.
