COMMENTS
Obj was probably a high-flying jet a/c where ops jet was operating in vicinity of WPAFB. It is not unusual for high-flying jet to not be heard. Distance and wind direction are important factors. A/c was displaying other lights, but ground white running light on device. There is no evidence which would indicate that this was not an a/c.

Analysis and Conclusions: THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY A HIGH FLYING JET AIRCRAFT. THERE ARE OFTEN JET AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE VICINITY OF WPAFB. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR HIGH FLYING JET AIRCRAFT NOT TO BE HEARD. THE DISTANCE AND WIND DIRECTION ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS. THE AIRCRAFT WAS DISPLAYING OTHER LIGHTS ALOFT FROM THE GROUND THE WHITE RUNNING LIGHT IS THE ONLY OBVIOUS ONE. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT THIS WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT.
