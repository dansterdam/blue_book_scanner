G. WEATHER AT TIME OF SIGHTING: SURFACE WINDS, 180 DEGREES, 5 KNOTS
FROM 1100 TO 1302, WIND CONFIGURATION WAS AS FOLLOWS:
6000     200 DEGREES     10 KNOTS
12000    190 DEGREES     20 KNOTS
16000    200 DEGREES     15 KNOTS

CLOUD COVER WAS SCATTERED AT 10000 FEET, VISIBILITY 9 MILE.
H. POSSIBLE EXPLANATION: CONSIDERING THAT METEOROIDS HAD ALREADY
BEEN SIGHTED, THIS WAS PROBABLY JUST AN UNUSUALLY BRIGHT ONE.
TIME IN FLIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN MAGNIFIED IN THE AIRMAN'S MEMORY.
THE FACT OF THE YELLOW-ORANGE COLOR MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONLY CHEMICALS IN
THE METEOR.
