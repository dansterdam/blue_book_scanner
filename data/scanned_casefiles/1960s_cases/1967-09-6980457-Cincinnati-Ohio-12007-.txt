On September 6, 1967, at approximately 8:00 P.M., the reporting witness, who lives in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, observed an unidentified flying object in the sky. The object was described as a dark, elongated shape hovering above the trees. The witness observed the object for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before it moved rapidly and disappeared from view.

The witness reported the sighting to the United States Air Force, as was the standard procedure for such events at the time under Project Blue Book. An investigation was conducted, but no definitive explanation for the sighting could be determined.

CINCINNATI, OHIO - 12007
AERIAL PHENOMENA
This incident occurred on 6 September 1967 at approximately 3:20 A.M. At this time, the witness, an air traffic controller working in the control tower at the Greater Cincinnati Airport, observed a large, oval-shaped object in the sky to the east of the airport. The object was described as having a hazy, indistinct outline and appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly. The witness watched the object for several minutes, noting that it seemed to be luminous or self-illuminating. After approximately 5 minutes, the object appeared to accelerate and moved rapidly to the northeast, disappearing from view.

The witness was an experienced air traffic controller who was very familiar with various types of aircraft. He stated that the object he observed was unlike any conventional aircraft he had seen before. The weather at the time was clear, with good visibility. No other witnesses could be located.

This report was forwarded to Project Blue Book for evaluation. The case was classified as "UNIDENTIFIED" by the Project Blue Book staff.
