Civilian

10. CONCLUSION
AIRCRAFT

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The object was first observed about 30 deg above the horizon and appeared to be traveling northwest. After the initial sighting, the object seemed to descend slightly and assumed a level flight at a level, 90 degrees right from was made and the object continued a level, 90 degrees right until no longer visible. There was a T-33 A/C approaching Langley AFB at approximately 2335z. The flight path of the object closely approximates the descent and turn executed by the aircraft.

(5) Amount of cloud cover: 3/8.

(6) Thunderstorms in the area: None.

(7) Temperature gradient:
ALTITUDE     TEMPERATURE
Surface      20°C
6,000        5°C
10,000       0°C
15,000       -9°C
20,000      -20°C
30,000      -42°C
50,000      -62°C

h. Astronomical Conditions: Captain Frederick A. Trippe, USAF, Chief of Navigator Training, 4500 Air Base Wing Instrument School, stated that no planets were visible in the area of the sighting on 20 April 1966.

i. Interception action Taken: None.

j. A T-33 aircraft approaching Langley AFB for a landing was in the area of the sighting at approximately 2335 zulu.

k. This report was prepared by Captain James R. Lewis, Jr., USAF, 4500 Air Base Wing Operations Division, Langley AFB, Virginia. I believe the object sighted was a T-33 aircraft which was approaching Langley AFB for a landing on runway 07. The flight path of the object closely approximates the descent and turn executed by the aircraft just prior to entering initial approach. Reduce power on the aircraft coupled with surface noises in the neighborhood, could have accounted for the observers not hearing any sound. During my investigation, I have observed T-53 aircraft from approximately the same angle and under similar light conditions which previously at the time of the sighting, and have noted an optical illusion in which the aircraft appears to assume the shape of the object reported by the observers.

1. Existence of physical evidence: None.
