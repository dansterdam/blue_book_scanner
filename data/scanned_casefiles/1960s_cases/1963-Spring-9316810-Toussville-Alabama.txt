MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SERVICES, OASD ATTENTION: MR. PETER A. ERICKSON

SUBJECT: Reply to Letter from Mr. [redacted]

Following is a suggested draft or reply to your letter [redacted] concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the sky over Toussville, Alabama on March 19, 1964.

"Dear [redacted]:

This is in reply to your letter of recent date in which you reported an observation of an unidentified flying object in the sky over Toussville, Alabama on March 19, 1964.

Thank you for reporting this observation to the U.S. Government. Your report has been reviewed and we find that the object observed was most likely one of our re-entry vehicles, sent aloft by one of our stations for tracking purposes. The vehicle and therefore parachutes were used to slow the vehicle down so it would not be damaged on landing.

Unidentified objects in the area reported it as an unusual sighting which would appear that they were sighting our re-entry vehicle.

We are enclosing, for your information, a Fact Sheet which has been compiled by the Air Force on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects and a report on the proceedings of the Unidentified Phenomena program. This will help to explain the Air Force program for the investigation and evaluation of reports on this matter.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information"

Dear Sir:

I have been unable to pass up the opportunity to write to you regarding subject matter about which I was not something that seemed to us to have pleased. Please first let me express the pleasure I felt over (early part) of spring. My wife and I were in our backyard gardening. while thus engaged, we happened to look up at the exact minute, we would not - but for having been so at the moment - have noticed a lighted object of some kind approaching us from the west and passing over in a northeasterly direction. This was not a balloon or any other thing with which we were familiar. Nor was it like a plane or anything having usual shape. Here is how I would describe it:

It was a rather brilliantly lighted object, looking quite white, shaped somewhat like a flattened sphere. It was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, straight and level, without any hesitation in its flight. It was not affected by the wind, for the distance it covered in so short a time was amazing. What really struck us as strange was the fact that there was no sound whatsoever accompanying its passage. Upon disappearing, it left no trail or vapor behind it. We were simply awestruck at what we had witnessed. It all happened so quickly, and the object was traveling so swiftly, that we did not have time to do anything but stand and gaze in sheer amazement.

I hope this letter does not appear to be the ravings of some crank. I can assure you that my wife and I are quite normal, level-headed people. What we saw was definitely not a natural phenomenon as far as we could judge. I want to cooperate fully with your organization in any way I can to help solve this mystery. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to write me. If it would be helpful, I should be glad to come to your office or to some other place convenient to you to discuss this matter further.

Sincerely yours,

P.S. I don't know how I added so much more, but I thought to tell you that I have been a poor man my whole life to Mr. Kennedy's - but I have not taken his place in Kennedy's family and specifically being one of the lucky ones. I should think that have been born again until are still seem and much to the affairs of this world. (Please excuse)
P.--- How about a small snapshot?
You request a photograph. I will see what I can find. If I have any I will be glad to send you a different one. The truth is I don't recall taking any pictures or have any to send you.
This appears to be from Shelby County, Alabama. What is the direction of interest? I have not figured it out. Perhaps you can tell me more.
I appreciate so much what we saw. I have not photographed it, but I will try to obtain some pictures of more plain picture, so that I can send them to you. As you requested, I am enclosing a copy of more plain pictures or photographs.
The Captain whom I volunteered from the 4th U.S. Army to deliver this case. I would like very much to talk with you, so I can go over the details in full. Perhaps I should try to arrange for an interview (official Investigator) group. I would appreciate it very much.
I want no recognition. I was in no position to request it. I was simply trying to be of assistance, but still you should know the whole matter.
Please return pictures. Then I'll send you all I can find and the others in detail.
