MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SERVICES, OASD
ATTENTION: MR. PETER A. ERICKSON
SUBJECT: Reply to Letter from Mr. [redacted]

Following is suggested draft of reply to concerning two objects he and observed over St. Clair County, Alabama:

"Dear [redacted]:

This is in reply to your letter of recent date in which you reported seeing two unusual objects in the sky over St. Clair County last spring.

Thank you for reporting this observation to the U.S. Government. What you saw was probably the re-entry of two test vehicles, sent aloft by one of our bases to test the metal on a missile or for some other purpose which made it necessary to recover the capsule, and therefore parachutes were used to slow the vehicle down so it would not be damaged on landing.

Since no base in the area reported it as an Unidentified Flying Object, it would appear that they were aware of the test.

We are enclosing, for your information, a Fact Sheet which has recently been compiled by the Air Force on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects and Unusual Aerial Phenomena. It is believed that this Fact Sheet will be of interest to you and will help to explain the Air Force program for the investigation and evaluation of reports of this nature.

Sincerely,"

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF

January 6th, 1964

Dear Sir:

I have hesitated to write to you concerning this matter. But I have been to believe that it could be something important. My country does not know of and should know about itself if it was not something that belonged to us. Please, let me explain, I do not go around seeing boozer-bears.

Last (early part) of Spring, my wife and I were in our back yard. The sky was a beautiful blue. We were looking up and discussing how beautiful it was. Has we not been looking up at first, which would make you think of a parachute, and then in about 10 seconds we saw something white, traveling at tremendous speed only (a speck) was coming from and about the same time we saw the first orange object, then another parachute looking (small) white object did the same close to the other. Then, by this time, the first object had been to the left, I turned and had turned almost at the same time and was looking almost directly at it. I have hesitated to give you the exact time, but we saw it almost at the same time. We saw it almost simultaneously. I am sure that our observation, about what we saw, would not be a cloud. In the sky... A beautiful day and no doubt an orange object moving as fast as our imagination and no doubt you're had one more reason to believe than I have given you. I said before, I supported you and I reaffirm you said. Mr. Kennedy was what I always wanted to be like. -- I pray that Almighty God will give you men that are like, the strength and wisdom always, in leading our nation in the way that's best for it. I have been criticized and stepped on many times here for my outspoken ways in speaking for John F., when he was alive. As far as I am concerned, he is not dead, and as Kennedy said -- ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country. I shall always remember these words and I shall live by them. For any man who truly loves his country may be called at any time to give his life.

I am ready. Have been and always will.

Here is the text from the document:

I say:
Love and understanding is something that can be shared by everyone throughout this world, without a loss to anyone, but, yet, again to all mankind.

Sincerely -- (Jim)
- Box
Toussville, Alabama

P.S. I don't know how I added so much more, but I thought of you being close to Mr. Kennedy. -- I have been a poor boy in my life (materially) but oh, how I've been blessed so many other ways especially with a large beautiful family, and especially being one of two lucky one's to have been born under the stars and stripes of Old Glory. (Please excuse pen.)

P.S. How about a small snapshot?
Upon request, from you, if you wish, I will send you a diagram of just what we saw and how it happened. They were not shaped like lighter planes of the sky, but more like a rocket type ship.

This happened over "St. Clair County" Alabama. Which is about 35 miles from Huntsville Space Center. That is the direction that we were.

I definitely do not doubt what we saw! We have not discussed it to others. Only between ourselves. And when we saw it, we immediately knew what it was. We were some kind of rocket planes or rockets.

Enclosed you will find some pictures of a project at a school near Huntsville, co-operation. I enclose picture (1) from Ralph Duncan, Jr. the President, to present to the school. Many people hate my guts for this. Wasn't that pathetic?

The Captain Macon who volunteered from the 4th U.S. Army to active this flag and Sgt. R.J. Huddleston (Paratroic Instructor of the V.F.W.) I would like very much to send a document (affidavit) concerning these two men and also Mr. J.W. (Jim) Woods who donated men and (3) trucks to install flag pole and set up.

I want no recognition - I owe it to America, but will you please tell me where and who I can contact to have these men (for their efforts) for a very worthwhile project?

Please return pictures. - Then I'll send an affidavit and that same names and addresses in detail.
