1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 12 August 65 12/1652
2. LOCATION: Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
3. SOURCE: Military-Air
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Less than 1 Minute
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Air-Visual
7. COURSE: Ascending, Descending
8. PHOTOS: ☐ Yes ☒ No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: ☐ Yes ☒ No

10. CONCLUSION: MIRAGE
Appearance of object attributed to a mirage of the sun due to motion of the observer a/c and the atmospheric conditions present. (Haze) sun at 65 deg elevation 235 deg azimuth.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Less than 1 Minute Assumed A/C of observer heading 800 deg azimuth in descent from 3,000 ft to 2,000 ft. Object observed through cockpit at 3 O'clock position slightly higher than the a/c (Appeared to be 5 miles distant). WK was very dense haze. Object appeared to move to the EAST (090 deg). Moved in a sunwise pattern and appeared as bright as sunlight, in the ascent and as a dim gray object partially hidden by haze in the descending portion. Speed increased with each ascent and on the third descent it appeared to level off and accelerate away at 600 knots or more. Disappeared into haze at 235 deg. Reflection from sun on observer a/p into the haze. Noted on the cph.

1. At approximately 1115 on 12 August 1965, while flying in a T-29B aircraft, likely 12, on a local transmission flight out of Wright-Patterson AFB, I saw an unidentified object maneuvering in flight.

2. Capt Cahoon was the instructor pilot on board. He was seated in the copilot's seat (right seat) and Capt Dixon, undergoing a proficiency flight check, was in the pilot's seat (left seat). I was seated in a forward facing seat, adjacent to the left, located about midway over the aircraft wing and there was one seat between me and the window. My view was unobstructed through the window. We were beginning a GCA approach and had just steadied out from a left turn onto a magnetic heading of 3000. We were descending from 8000 feet to 3000 feet. We had just completed our turn after passing over Springfield, and were 2 or 3 miles North East of that city. I saw the object through the window at about our 3 O'Clock position. It was slightly higher than us, and it appeared to be about 5 miles away. The haze was very dense, and it was estimated that it could not have been farther than 7 miles from us. It was moving in a general direction of 0900. It moved in a sin curve pattern, strongly reflecting sunlight. When it was ascending, but appearing only visible as a gray object, partially hidden by haze, in its descent. Its speed seemed to be faster as was the case of the speed in its 3 descents. On its third descent, it appeared to be level off at a speed of at least 600 knots and accelerate away into the base at a speed of at least 600 knots or more.

The rest of the text is too faint or blurry to confidently transcribe. There appears to be a handwritten diagram or notation with arrows and degrees, but the full details are not legible.
