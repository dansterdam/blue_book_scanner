About 30° above horizon, object separated into 2 parts. Flew place about 3 times size of second piece, increased to be on a course of 000° T. Object burned out and disappeared into horizon.

11. COMMENTS
There was no report of satellite at time of sighting. Descending object characteristic of a bolide entering earth's atmosphere and breaking up. Orbit is extensive for normal meteor. But this can be accounted for by its northerly course.
