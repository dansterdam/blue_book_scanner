...On Page 11 of our September issue we described the strange case of [redacted] a 10-year-old Albuquerque, N. M.

Now we learn that, according to her mother, little Sharon grew 5½ inches and gained 25 pounds during the next month, and even underwent a very noticeable personality change. Whether or not this is a direct result of the UFO sighting has not been established yet...
