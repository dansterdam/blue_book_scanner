It then moved slowly to the south, turned and moved overhead, and then turned and moved rapidly to the northeast and disappeared. The object was described as round and glowing, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. It gave off a brilliant white light and blue-green flames or sparks were emitted from it. The object was in sight for approximately two minutes.  

Radar at Kirkland Air Force Base did not pick up the object.  

An investigation is being conducted by the Air Force.
