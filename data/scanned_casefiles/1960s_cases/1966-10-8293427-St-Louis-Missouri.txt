REPLY TO
ATTN OF: SELA/C-11 SPO (1t.)
SUBJECT: Possible UFO Sighting

TO: TDER/UFO (Maj. Quintanilla)

1. Reference is made to the 5 Dec 66 telecon between Maj. Quintanilla (FTD) and myself (1t.)

2. I informed Maj. Quintanilla that I have four 35 mm slides taken by my father-in-law, Mr. [redacted], in South St. Louis, Missouri between 2300 and 2350, 29 October 1966. The following information is transmitted concerning the slides:

a. Slide No. 1 was taken with a 3 minute time exposure.
b. No. 2 - 5 minutes
c. No. 3 - 10 minutes
d. No. 4 - 15 minutes
e. All slides were taken facing slightly North of East with an Exata camera on tripod.
f. At the time the slides were taken Scott AFB informed Mr. [redacted] that they have a UFO on radar.
g. The planetarium in St. Louis, after having seen the slides and compared them with a star chart, indicated that it was the planet Jupiter.

3. Even though item g above seems to identify the object on the slides, I decided to send them to your office for your information. I assume all of the above information represents very close approximations.

For further information contact:

LOCATION CLINTON, MISSOURI                            DATE Aug, Sept, Oct 66

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF:                   IR:                   QUALITY:
P NRS: 6 - 35 mm Color Transparencies, 6 B&W 8 x 10 Prints, 6 - 35 mm B&W Negatives

1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to answer Work Order Number 67-12 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, Jr. for an analysis and determination of the object's identities, if possible.

2. ANALYSIS:

a. Slides #1 & #7, from Mr. [redacted] appear to be as follows: #1 is a normally exposed good quality transparency with one water spot or chip in emulsion probably caused in processing. #7 may also be a good transparency, highly magnified. It may also be some object or reflection of some shape other than shown, but made to appear as two lobes with high light and shadows by the extent of contact of focus. The higher the magnification, the more focus can alter the image size and shape. The image on slide #7 could be of an object, a light source, or a reflection of a light source. Any identification from the available information would be only speculation.

b. Slides #10 and #11, from Mr. [redacted] were taken in the hours of near darkness and slides #12 and #13 were taken in daylight. All four of these slides appear to have been taken through the same window and nearly along the same azimuth. Slide #10 shows what appears to be a light source, airborne or elevated above the horizon. Slide #11 shows the same light source, or a similar subsequent light source in the same approximate position, dependent upon the time lapse between frames, but of a longer duration. A slower shutter speed on frame #11, as compared to #10, would produce a lighter transparency, capture more of the movement of the object and make the object or image appear longer. These conditions have been met in frame #11 which is of lighter density and has a longer image. An aircraft landing light could produce such images.

c. Slides #12 and #13 show linear patterns such as of smoke, gas, vapor or exhaust trails. These patterns appear in approximately the area as the lights or reflections in slides #10 and #11. The linear patterns of the object in slides #12 and #13 are nearly parallel to the apparent movement of the light in slide #11. The similarity of implied motion in three of the four slides, #11, #12, and #13, suggests numerous objects traveling in the same area and same direction, such as traffic on an airport approach or airway.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 67-9     DATED    14 February 1967

d. Another possibility is suggested in slides #12 and #13. That is of an aborted attempt at skywitting. The abort is suggested in slide #12 by the "dot" of smoke to the right of the upper end of the line. The "dot" appears to be a 90 degree continuation of a letter, after the stem had been formed, when the smoke release failed to stay open. No aircraft is visible in slide #12 or #13.

e. The frame numbers supplied by a processor are usually a reliable indicator of the film sequence through the camera. Since frames #10, #11, #12 and #13 were all hand dated 29 October 1966 this would indicate frames #10 and #11 were taken in the pre-daylight hours, or prior to slides #12 and #13, rather than in the evening hours of the 29th of October.

Request for Distribution of Photo

Mr. [redacted]
St. Louis, Missouri

Reference your recent photographs of the planet Jupiter which were taken on October 29, 1965. Project Blue Book is currently in the process of selecting various photographs for distribution to the general public. We would appreciate the opportunity to release one of your photographs, if possible. Of course, we could not release your name and address unless you so desire, since your name associated with the photograph might cause undue publicity.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

27 OCT 66
ST. LOUIS, MO.

SAF01CC/Maj Cassell/jea/70079/12 Apr 67

Dear [redacted]:

Reference your recent photographs of a sighting of a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) over the St. Louis, Missouri area on October 30, 1966.

Photographic analysis revealed the following: The images appear to have been taken through the same window and nearly show the same general area. Slide #10 shows what appears to be a 11-inch source, either on or above ground. The next slide, Slide #11, shows a light source or a similar subsequent light source in the same approximate position, dependent upon the time lapse between the two slides, Slide #12 and #13 show similar objects out the longer exposure time has been reduced from the first images.

According to The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac 1966, the chart implies such a part of the sky was in the allowed UFO. A study of the submitted data has led much to the conclusion that Jupiter was observed and photographed.

I am returning your slides and the enlargements which we made. Thank you for submitting your photographs to the U.S. Air Force for analysis.

Sincerely,
[signature]

Attachment: (4 slides + 2 enlargements)
