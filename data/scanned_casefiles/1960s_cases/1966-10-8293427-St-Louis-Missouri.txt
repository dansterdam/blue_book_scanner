SUBJECT: Possible UFO Sighting

TO: TDER/UFO (Maj. Quintanilla)

1. Reference is made to the 5 Dec 66 telcon between Maj. Quintanilla (AFSC) and myself (Lt.
2. I informed Maj. Quintanilla that I have four 35 mm slides taken by my father-in-law, Mr. Schlitt, Missouri between 2300 and 2330, 29 October 1966. The following information is transmitted concerning the slides:

a. Slide No. 1 was taken with a 3 minute time exposure.
b. No. 2 - 5 minutes
c. No. 3 - 10 minutes
d. No. 4 - 15 minutes
e. All slides were taken facing slightly North of East with an Exacta camera on tripod.
f. At the time the slides were taken Scott AFB informed Mr. Schlitt that they have a UFO on radar.
g. The planetarium in St. Louis, after having seen the slides and compared them with a star chart, indicated that it was the planet Jupiter.
3. Even though item g above seems to identify the object on the slides, I decided to send them to your office for your information. I assume all of the above information represents very close approximations.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT   NR 67-9
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS, CLINTON, MISSOURI 
LOCATION CLINTON, MISSOURI - ST. LOUIS
DATE Aug.-Sept.-Oct. 66
PHOTOGRAPHY
AF * IT QUALITY
P NRS 6 - 35 mm Color Transparencies, 6 B&W 8 x 10 Prints, 6 - 35 mm B&W Negatives

1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to answer Work Order Number 67-12 submitted by
Major R. J. Quintanilla, Jr. for an analysis and determination of the objects' identities, if
possible.

2. ANALYSIS:
a. Slides #1 & #7, from Mr.______, appear to be as follows: #1 is a normally
exposed good quality transparency with one water spot or chip in emulsion probably caused
in processing. #7 may also be a good transparency, highly magnified. It may also be some
object or reflection of some shape other than shown, but made to appear as two lobes with
high light and shadows by the extent of close-up focus. The higher the magnification, the
more focus can alter the image size and shape. The image on slide #7 could be of an object,
a light source, or a reflection of a light source. Any identification from the available information
is strictly speculation.

b. Slides #10, and #11, from Mr.______, were taken in the hours of near darkness
and slides #12 and #13 were taken in daylight. All four of these slides appear to have been
taken through the same window and nearly along the same azimuth. Slide #10 shows what
appears to be a light source above the horizon. Slide #11 shows the same light source, with
a similar light source, on a similar subsequent light path. Both of these positions,
dependent on the time duration, appear to represent motion or travel. A slower shutter
speed on frame #11, as compared to #10, would produce a lighter transparency, capture more
of the movement of the object and make the object or image appear longer. These conditions
have been met in frame #11 which is of lighter density and has a longer image. An aircraft
landing light could produce such images.

C. Slides #12 and # 13 show linear patterns such as of smoke, gas, vapor or exhaust
trails. These patterns appear in approximately the area as the lights or reflections in slides
#10 and #11. The linear patterns of the object in slides #12 and #13 are nearly parallel to the
apparent movement of the light in slide #11. The similarity of implied motion in three of the
four slides, #11, #12, and #13, suggests numerous objects traveling in the same area and
same direction. Such as traffic on an airport approach or airway.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 67-9 . DATED 14 February 1967

4. Another possibility is suggested in slides #12 and #13. That is of an aborted attempt at skywriting. The object is suggested in slide #12 by the "dot" of smoke to the right of the upper end of the line. The "dot" appears to be a 90 degree continuation of a letter, after the stem had been formed, when the smoke release failed to stay open. No aircraft is visible in slide #12 or #13.

6. The frame numbers supplied by a processor are usually a reliable indicator of the film sequence through the camera. Since frames #10, #11, #12 and #13 were all hand dated 29 October 1966 this would indicate frames #10 and #11 were taken in the pre-daylight hours, or prior to slides #12 and #13, rather than in the evening hours of the 29th of October.

Text from the document:

USAF/UPS
Request for Distribution of Photo
8 June 1967

Mr. [redacted]
St. Louis, Missouri

Reference your recent photographs of the planet Jupiter which were taken on October 29, 1966. Project Blue Book is currently in the process of collecting various photographs for distribution to the general public. We would appreciate the opportunity to release one of your photographs in connection with this program. It is possible that this action might cause some annoyance with your name associated with the photograph, but this publicity might cause undue notoriety.

The photographic analysis revealed the following information: The object (9 to 10 feet in diameter) possessed the sane appearance like an ordinary aircraft, except for a few differences noted. The shape of the object was round, with indications of a raised dome. Edges were indistinct, and the object appeared to be illuminated. The white light color contrasted with the dark background. The object possessed a similar brightness throughout its circumference, without noticeable variations. Its movement was described as hovering, with no specific directional trend indicated. The conclusion was that the object was observed and photographed.
