March 31, 1966

Dear Major Russell:

My husband and I were greatly pleased to see the article on life about Project Blue Book. Until we read it, we had not realized that we had an experience which might be of interest.

In the early morning hours of June 27, 1964, we were awakened at around 2:00 a.m. by a brilliant light outside our bedroom window. This light was stationary, round, and about the size of a basketball, and was very bright, almost blinding, and hovered about 6-8 feet off the ground.

We watched it for about 20 minutes, and then it suddenly shot straight up out of sight. It moved with incredible speed and without any sound. There were no clouds in the sky and the moon was bright.

What people would believe it? We have never mentioned this to anyone for fear of being considered cranks. Would it be of any interest to your files? If so, how would we go about getting it recorded?

I hope you can find the time to answer my inquiry. I would be most grateful.

Sincerely yours,

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing a UFO sighting.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Could you help us decide on what your best view was. We would appreciate any information or opionion you might have. 
The size was not known exactly, long shape and bright. We are not looking for notority, only want to help in study of flying objects. We wondered how the phenomena could be analyzed. Would that be handled by the Blue Book program? Have the same incidents been recorded elsewhere. I would not know as there seems to be no green light reflecting to observers out there.

Thank you for your help handling this unusual report. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, which appears to be an old UFO report from Project Blue Book. 

The text in the document reads:

"Forty groufield cheepale just oveen ovens river into our town (Swansea) had some form of round object or vehicle come toward them for soe time. Could not describe it fully etc. Three boys say it was very bright like lights, in a kind of floating motion, and appear to sperat nfront of them again. Can this be verified?? The mere mention of the name of the boy might cause trouble. To save them any embarrassment, I will not include their names. I think this is a very strange occurrence, and I hope you will be able to investigate and see what can be done. Perhaps you could have someone contact me and I could give you more details. The boys were very upset by this experience, and I think it would be best if their names were not included."
