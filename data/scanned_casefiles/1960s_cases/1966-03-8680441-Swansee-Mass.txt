Dear Major Quintanilla,

My husband and I were not pleased to see the article in LIFE about Project Blue Book. Until we received this magazine, today we had resigned ourselves to never finding out just what we really did last Sunday night on our way home from the city (Hullriver, Mass)

We promptly decided that the huge brilliant orange crescent-shaped most we followed would be our secret - who would believe us? Those people we know would just laugh as if we were crazy. Still who ever heard of just such a "moon" at midnight on the extreme western horizon. It seemed to be practically setting on the horizon or so.

Could you help us decide on what we saw. We would appreciate any information you might find us.

We're not hard such dirty, long-hair and hippie. We're not looking for notoriety, or making up, or wild tales. We honestly give this.

A picture on the left has the form brilliant proofs, when, but what we saw was in a neutral position, and very definitely present - shaped. As we face it, the light was not very smooth; the light is regular. We saw no green lights or flashing colors, etc.

Jerry gospel phyped just now
the fires here into our town
(Swansea) has some kind of
geometric spotlight. But now
such we we plan then from
the place ferry bridge at the
latter harbor of Somerset??
We were frustrated, so instead
of turning off the highway
on our street, we drove to the
barest, sparsest spot on town.
At the end of a barren bleach
we have a long peak to a boat
jump. - Here we again
had the present practically
sitting on the tent-top, already
to on the far phone here.
Then - - just like the petting
farm, this beautiful object slipped
over the edge of the horizon
and disappeared. The story for a
long time at the end of the
land hoping it would re-appear,
it didn't.

The happened Sunday at
the well 27th at 11:45 to just
after midnight. No fog or mist tell.
