AFR 200-17(C)

In the margin above the compass diagram, the text is partially illegible, but appears to be related to describing a phenomenon.

The compass diagram shows cardinal and intercardinal directions (N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW, SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW).

The text below the compass diagram reads:
"IN THE NORTH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 'O' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW AN ARROW SHOWING THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THESE TWO POINTS. THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIGZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH."

The document includes two sketches of a road through a landscape:
- A larger sketch showing a road cutting through hilly or mountainous terrain
- A smaller sketch showing the same road layout with an arrow indicating movement direction

At the bottom of the page, it states "PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES"
