SUBJECT: UFO Color Photography

TO: FTD (TDEW/Maj Quintanilla)

1. Attached is a set of five (5) 8x10 color photos received from
the Deputy Chief, Operations and Training Division, Ent AFB,
Colorado, which were erroneously sent to Andrews AFB.

2. This misaddressed UFO package again points out the necessity
of stressing to all commands that FTD is located at Wright-Patterson
AFB Ohio.

3. This may require a change to paragraph 18, AFR 200-2, to include
the above address.
