Dear Sirs:

At this time I am writing to you, to inform you that during the past five years I have witnessed many unidentified flying objects. These sightings occurred in the evening dusk and in a northerly or north-westerly direction. From the location from which I observed these objects I would say they were traveling at a speed that would range approximately from thousands of miles per hour to a speed that would come to a complete stop, and proceed in the opposite direction at a terrific speed. At times it would go completely below the horizon and then in the same side of the sky. I seemed to fall in a certain pattern. Many occurrences in the northwestern or western sky. This apparently favored a part of the sky scaling from 0° to 30° although one would see much 40° above the horizon.

During most of these sightings I had observed only one object. Sometimes one of these objects would come somewhat near and the object would move quite rapidly developing a very densely slack center, the edges were ragged and not of uniform shape. The whole appearance was or seemed ragged most of the time. I saw it change shape during its rapid turns. During these turns it appeared to develop a sort of shape during its rapid turn. I had noticed that the object would slide side turns. I have observed it in clear skies and sometimes it would disappear into the clouds. My first noticed sighting was the one 9 P.M. at about 1930 P.M. the object with sightings while edgewise to my point of view toward the center and finally a deep Charlottetown. As I did before, the object changed course, moved somewhat erratically, was impeded by this and by the very way it changed shape during turns. I may be an object obtained by very fringe of possibly my maybe its not quite giving off a typical shape, the object was of a distance limited the sighting. During the majority of these sightings the object stood quite in color and with a hazy or apparent dust its rapid speed and maneuvered easily distinguished from a flock of birds or mine clouds.

Very truly yours,

I would say, that when it bunched up it slid actually 24 ypped up on its side, exposing itself broadside.

There are two hand-drawn sketches on the page:
1. A thin line labeled "thin line appearance"
2. A more oval/bunched up shape labeled "bunched up appearance"

P.S. other people
Have observed these
objects besides me.

This is approximately
what the object looked
like as it appeared in
the northwest sky
Sometimes it appeared
to be a thin
line moving, then
would seem to be bunched
and spread in another direction.
