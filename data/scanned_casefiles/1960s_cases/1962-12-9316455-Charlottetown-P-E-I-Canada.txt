Dear Sirs:

At this time I wish to inform you of information gained from a close and personal observation of a flying object. This object was sighted on September 13, 1962 at approximately 9:30 PM. The object was observed for a period of approximately 10 to 15 minutes, as it hovered in the sky over Charlottetown, P.E.I., Canada.

The object appeared to be circular in shape, and was observed to be bright white in color. It was observed to be moving silently, and changing directions, without any apparent propulsion system. The object was observed to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter, and was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 feet. 

On several occasions the object was observed to suddenly increase in brightness, to the point where it became almost painful to look at. It would then dim and return to its original brightness. This fluctuation in brightness occurred on 3 or 4 occasions during the observation period.

I trust this information will be of use to your department in the ongoing investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
[Handwritten signature]

The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

During night of December 3 1962 sighted a slightly glowing object about the size of a small jet aircraft at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft. coming from the east. Watched it for several minutes. Object appeared to have a reddish-orange glow at the rear. It was completely silent. Object suddenly stopped and hovered motionless for a few seconds, then accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared in a westerly direction. No vapour trail was observed. There was no reflection of any kind. The sky was clear and the moon was bright. This observation was made by 3 independent witnesses. The object was also under observation by at least one other person in a different location in Charlottetown. The above report has been checked and the information appears to be reliable.

The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The first sketch appears to show some kind of object or phenomenon, described as "appearance" in the text. The second sketch shows a "bunched up" or gathered shape. There is no photograph present in this image.

The text in the document reads:

"It appeared that when it bunched up on its side, exposing broadside."

The image appears to contain a simple sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch depicts an elongated, oblong-shaped object hovering above the ground, with the caption "P.s. other people have observed these objects besides me." The image does not contain any human faces or identities.

Transcription of text in the document:
