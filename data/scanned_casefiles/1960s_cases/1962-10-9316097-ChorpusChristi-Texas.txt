Dear Maj. Brokeshoulder:

For your information, I am sending to you herewith a copy of a letter which we have received from Technical Center concerning the glass sample which you forwarded to me. The glass sample is also being returned to your herewith.

It appears that your judgment as to the probable source of this fragment was correct. I sincerely trust that this information is helpful to you.

Yours very truly,

OWENS-ILLINOIS
INTRA-COMPANY CORRESPONDENCE

Subject: Glass Sample Received from the Air Force

Examination of the subject sample indicated that the largest fragment possessed both a blown surface and a molded surface which was crackled. Since these two surfaces were opposite each other, the wedge-shaped area between these surfaces represented the thickness of the original sample. This thickness varied from 1/2" to 3/4".

Generically speaking, the molded surface of these fragments was practically identical to the cracked surface of the bottom of large carboys, acid bottles or the 5 gallon wide-mouthed jobs currently sold for "Gardens in Glass". In addition to the raised crackle lines, definite depressed lines or crevices were also present. Microscopic examination indicated that these lines or crevices were shear marks. Therefore, the ware was made from a sheared gob.

Considering the foregoing characteristics, it appears that the glass fragments may have originated from one of the larger carboys or wide mouth jars having capacities of 5 or 6-1/2 gallons. Also, evidence of a sheared gob would indicate that the ware was machine made. I believe that our Alton Flint composition is the only plant having the necessary machinery to do these large jobs. Therefore, it is quite possible that the glass sample represents Alton Flint composition.

Emersion in monochlorobenzene indicated that the glass fragments have a refractive index similar to ordinary soda-lime-silica glasses.

On the basis of the foregoing information, it appears that a chemical analysis is not necessary. Therefore, the sample is being returned with this correspondence.

EVALUATION REPORT

Analysis of Glass-like sample.

REPORT NR: 62-24                                 DATE: 3 December 1962
PROJECT NR: 5140(116)                             TYPE EVALUATION:
MANUFACTURER:                                     SPEC NR:
SUBMITTED BY: Lt. Col. R. J. Friend                ITEM SERIAL NR:

I.   PURPOSE
     To chemically analyze a glass-like sample.

II.  FACTUAL DATA
     a. The sample was assigned ASRCPA control number 10,360.

     b. It was tested for radioactivity using a scintillation counter.
        No radioactivity above normal background was detected.

     c. The sample was tested for the transmission of light in the region
        from the far ultraviolet to the far infrared. It has good trans-
        mission only in the near infrared region 0.75 to 1.75 microns.
        It has about 10% transmission in the visible region, 0.4 to 0.75
        microns, and about the same transmission as plate glass elsewhere.
        It is not a usual window material outside the near infrared.

     d. It breaks along a plane of cleavage when it has been sharply
        struck with a course hammer. The slivers and sharp edges crumble
        when tested by finger. The sample has undergone some form of mild
        heat treatment such as fire polishing.

     e. Chemical analysis for carbon and hydrogen using microchemical
        techniques detected no carbon and only 0.16% by weight of hydrogen.
        This concentration of hydrogen is less than the allowable error of
        + 0.3%; consequently the significance is negligible.

     f. Analysis by light emission spectrography provided these data:

Element                   Concentration (% by weight)
Silicon                   greater than 10
Sodium                    greater than 10
Calcium                   10
Potassium                 less than 1
Aluminum                  0.5
Boron                     less than 0.1
Lead                      less than 0.1
Iron                      0.05
Magnesium                 0.05
Titanium                  0.01
Nickel                    less than 0.01
Zinc                      less than 0.01
Copper                    less than 0.01

c. The chemical analysis provided these data:

Oxides                    Weight Percent
Silicon dioxide           70.55%
Calcium oxide             13.62%
Sodium oxide              10.85%
Magnesium oxide           1.15%
Potassium oxide           0.24%

b. The density of the sample is 2.281 g/cc.

c. The index of refraction is 1.4605.

j. Despite the less like configuration, the sample does not focus
   when similar. The mean pixel value on the pure surface shows
   a confused light pattern.

k. An x-ray diffraction pattern of the glass-like sample showed a
   residual background of non-crystalline silica. This identified
   silica was confirmed by infrared analysis in the 2 to 16
   micron region.

l. Exposure to an x-ray beam for fifteen minutes caused a brown
   discoloration to form.

III. CONCLUSIONS:

a. The absence of crystalline silica and high concentration of
   sodium oxide show that this glass is a low quality type of glass.

c. The chemical composition and low melting temperature confirm that the sample is a "bottle-glass" formulation.

IV. RECOMMENDATIONS:
    None, data merely submitted.
