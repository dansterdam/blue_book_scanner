Dear Maj. Brokesholder:

For your information, I am sending to you herewith a letter which we have received from our Technical Center concerning the glass sample which you forwarded to me. The glass sample is also being returned to you herewith.

It appears that your judgment as to the probable source of this fragment was correct. I sincerely trust that this information is helpful to you.

Yours very truly,

OWENS-ILLINOIS
INTER-COMPANY CORRESPONDENCE

Glass Sample Received from the Air Force

Examination of the subject sample indicated that the largest fragments contained both a green and a molded surface which was cracked. Since these two surfaces were opposite each other, the wedge-shaped pieces between them were apparently compressed to this thickness. These linear impressions or cracks, as represented by the broken surfaces, were approximately 2-3/8 inches long.

Generally speaking, the molded surface of these fragments was similar to the surface of large carboys, acid bottles or the 5 gallon wide-mouthed jars currently sold for 5 gallons in junk. In addition to the raised cradle lines, there were some surface irregularities and small pits.

Examination indicated that these lines or grooves were shear marks.

Considering the foregoing characteristics, it appears that the glass fragments may have originated from one of the larger carboys or wide-mouth jars, since the ridges or evidence of the mold would indicate that the ware was machine molded. Also, since no necessary machinery to do these large jobs is present, it is quite possible that the glass sample represents a direct blow of some kind rather than a crush formation.

Impurities in amorphous character indicated that the glass presents a rather intricate design, not at all similar to commonly available glass. Moreover, a chemical analysis is not necessary. Therefore, the sample is being returned without this correspondence.

Analysis of Glass-like sample.

REPORT NO: 62-24*
PROJECT NO: 3140 (116)
MANUFACTURER: 
SUBMITTED BY: Lt. Col. R. J. Friend

I. PURPOSE:
TO chemically analyse a glass-like sample.

II. PARTIAL DATA:
a. The sample was assigned ASRCPA control number 10,360.
b. It was tested for radioactivity using a scintillation counter. No radioactivity above background was detected.
c. The sample was tested for the transmission of light in the visible region. It has good transmission in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared regions. It has about 10% transmission in the visible region, 0.4 to 0.75 micron wave length.
d. It became brittle on exposure to ultraviolet radiation within the test chamber.
e. Chemical analysis for carbon and hydrogen using microchemical techniques detected no carbon and only 0.16% by weight of hydrogen. This concentration of hydrogen is less than the allowable error of 1.02% consequent to the significance in negligible.
f. Analysis by light emission spectrography provided these data:

4. The density of the sample is 2.891 g/cc.
5. The index of refraction is 1.4683.
6. Despite the low silica configuration, the sample does not fuse at 1200Â°C. The sample figures on the plate surface cause it to act as a low quality type of glass.
7. An x-ray diffraction pattern of the sample showed a crystalline material consisting of calcium oxide and silica, confirmed by infrared analysis in the 3-5 micron region.
8. Exposure to a 3-watt beam for fifteen minutes caused a brown discoloration to occur.

III. TOTAL DATA:
a. The sample is of crystalline silica and high concentration of calcium that this type of glass is a low quality type of glass.
