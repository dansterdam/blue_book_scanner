The image contains a photograph of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be a "SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE" where the observer has provided information about a sighting, including the time, location, and a sketch depicting the height and position of the phenomenon above the horizon.

SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENON THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED.

There are two photographs present in this scanned document.

The first photograph is a compass rose diagram showing the different cardinal directions. It appears to be an illustration used to instruct readers on how to indicate the direction of a sighting when reporting a UFO or other aerial phenomenon.

The second photograph is a landscape sketch showing a person standing in the foreground with a scenic vista in the background. The illustration appears to be providing an example of how to visually depict a UFO sighting using a smaller sketch within the larger drawing.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

"IF, IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE A 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A T' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE PATH OF THE PHENOMENON. ALSO, DRAW IN THE COMPASS DIRECTIONS AS SHOWN IN THE LARGER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE SKETCH."

- page 7 -

The image contains a sketch depicting two unidentified flying objects. The document appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, as indicated by the heading at the top of the page. There is no photograph present, only a hand-drawn sketch of the observed objects. The text below the sketch describes the angular size and movement of the objects.

HAVE APPEARED AS MIGHT BE DESCRIBED BY PROJECTUSIENS, AND INDICATE EXTREMELY RAPID" CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND ERRATIC MOTION OF THE OBSERVED PHENOMENON. INDICATES BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

The text on the document has been produced as an OCR output:

HAVE APPEARED AS MIGHT BE DESCRIBED BY PROJECTUS1ONS, AND INDICATE EXTREMELY RAPID CHANGE OF DIREC TION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING. 
16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE WHEN HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR UTILITY POLE? SINCE NO KNOWN OBJECTS OF KNOWN SIZE WERE AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, IT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE FIELD OF VIEW THE PHENOMENON WOULD OCCUPY.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. 

Based on the OCR, the text in the document is as follows:

"DID YOU OBTAIN ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OR MOTION PICTURES OF THE PHENOMENON? ( ) YES ( ) NO. IF YES, DESCRIBE.
" (THESE MAY BE RETURNED TO YOU IF SO DESIRED."
"IN ORDER THAT MY ESTIMATE OF THE PHENOMENON MAY BE BASED ON COMPLETE INFORMATION, PLEASE GIVE ANY OTHER DETAILS WHICH YOU CAN RECALL REGARDING THE PHENOMENON.

THE INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

The handwritten text in the image says:
"It was a clear night, beautiful star-filled sky. The object seemed to move rather rapidly, first to the west then straight up vertically at a very high rate of speed, then it would stop and move again in any direction, it seemed to be under positive control. It was a bright white light, not like a star. It was the most remarkable thing I have ever seen. I wish I could explain just what it was, but I can't."

The text of the document is as follows:

SAF-OICC/Miss Turner*/76525/Mar. 1, 1963
MAR 7 - 1963

Dear Sirs:

This is a reply to your letter of March 5, 1963, in which you stated that you had observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) that you desired to have investigated.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate it further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES

Washington, D.C. 20330

Dear Sir:

As I realize how busy you must be, but kindly take my letter into consideration!

I and the rest of my family had just arrived home and were trying to make up the sidewalk to our house when an object of about the size of the 2nd star of the Big Dipper attracted our attention. It did not make any noise and the color was a definite orange color and traveled in a straight line downward for about 200 and then suddenly disappeared.

The duration of time that I saw it was about 60 seconds. It appeared it about 25 degrees west of the horizon & the lower end of the dip-per. The time was about 6:50. I saw this from there Janesville, Wisconsin where I was living. I saw it disappear and was about 5 or 6 minutes from the time I first saw it until the end of the sighting. This time was from 6:50 until about 6:55 or 6:56.

I swear with the utmost sincerity that the above is the truth.

Yours sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
