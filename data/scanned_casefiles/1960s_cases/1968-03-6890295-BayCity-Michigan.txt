Dear [redacted]

This will reply to your letter of March 5, 1968, in which you described an unidentified flying object (UFO) that you and your family observed.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES

March 5, 1968

Dear Sirs:

Now I realize how busy you must be, but kindly take my letter into consideration:

I and the rest of my family had just arrived home and were walking up the sidewalk to our house when an object of about the brightness of the sun and star of the big dipper attracted my attention. I did so because it was moving 3 times faster than a jet. It was a definite orange color and traveled in a straight line eastward to GOF Carroll and then made a right angle turn downward for about 200' and then suddenly disappeared.

The duration of time that I saw it was about 60 seconds. I spotted it about 25 degrees west of the moon. I will end of this big dipper. The time was about 8:50 and the weather only slightly cloudy.

Just about the exact spot where I saw it is 85° 77' west long. and 43°N. north latitude. I no doubt was cigar-shaped and was about 1/4 the size of the moon, and the date 3/4/68. It made no sound whatsoever.

I swear with the utmost sincerity that the above is the truth.

Yours sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
