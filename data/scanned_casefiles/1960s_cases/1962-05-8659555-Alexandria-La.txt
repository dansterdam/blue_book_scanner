(3) Color: White center with bluish-red halo offset resembling hot flame.

(4) Number: One

(5) Formation: N/A

(6) Discernible Features or details: Seemed to hesitate and waver or oscillate to left or right, then continue to move on new course. Pattern seemed at irregular intervals.

(7) While moving object appeared to have a tail similar to a comet or falling star.

(8) No sound was associated with observation.

(9) Other pertinent or unusual features: Observer states that he believed object was considerably brighter than the Nose satellite was on previous observations (by himself).

(1) Observer's account of weather: "Dark, but very, very clear night with an occasional "hazy cloud"."

(2) Report from nearest AWS or U.S. Weather Bureau:
[Wind direction, velocity, altitude, and temperature data table]

(3) Ceiling: Unlimited
(4) Visibility: 15 miles
(5) Cloud cover: None (Clear)
(6) No thunderstorms in area and quadrant of sighting.
(7) Temperature gradient: 3 degrees per 1000 ft.

No interception or identification action taken.

Check with surveillance activities revealed no flight activity equating to area of sighting.

This report has been prepared by SSgt Royce O. Borden, Intelligence Operations Specialist, 4013 Tactical Fighter Wing, England AFB, La. Preliminary analysis indicates that observed object was probably an airborne balloon, possibly of the type used by weather surveillance activities for taking "Pil-ball" reading with ground instruments.
