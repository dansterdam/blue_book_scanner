10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Between 1900 and 2030 hours, witness was citing between 1900 and 2030 hours, witness was citing in Kamchatka. Someone ran in yelling "Sputnik!" They ran out into street. They saw a good sized yellow light with vapor around it. Moved across and after high hod ran an appreciable distance. It was lost behind this overcast. No estimate of size or speed. Took several minutes to disappear. Believed to be moving to S.

11. COMMENTS
Although the movement of the object, the description as been through a haze of light overcast, and the duration was characteristic of an artificial satellite, it cannot be correlated with a known satellite to be in orbit at the time of the sighting. The elevation when first and last observed was not reported, precluding a valid conclusion as to the satellite observed. However sufficient information is available to assume that it was a satellite.
