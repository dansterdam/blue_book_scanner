Proposed reply to letter from 9 February 1967

Dear [redacted]

Please excuse our delay in answering your letter of 9 February 1967 in which you reported your observation to the Air Force. Without essential data such as angular velocity, flight characteristics, duration of the sighting, etc., a comprehensive evaluation cannot be undertaken. The form you sent to our office was of a June 1966 observation. If you had reported your June 1966 observation to the nearest Air Force Base, a detailed investigation would have been undertaken. It is extremely difficult to investigate a sighting which is more than a month or so old.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Sir:                                                   May 21, 1967

I do not remember exactly when I sighted the object that I am writing about. It was sometime during the summer.

My wife does neighbor and wife were camping out one night last summer. As we were sitting around the campfire a very bright object drifted across the sky and began to move across the sky. I know sometime was guiding the course as it was not a plane. We watched the object for some time as it was moving so slowly across the telescope. I was looking through the telescope and my wife (with me) saw the object. When they were directly over our campsite, the object was very small. What appeared to be glowing glass behind it. When they were moving over our campsite, it seemed to be about 2 acres in size. At least it looked larger and then vanished. The object was all lighted about 5 min.

                                                Sincerely,

P.S. Would you please send this and tell me what you think of it. I would also like to know if you heard of Project Blue Book.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Please excuse our delay in answering your letter in which you reported your observation to the Air Force.

Without essential data such as angular velocity, flight characteristics, duration of the sightings, etc., however a comprehensive evaluation cannot be undertaken. The Form you sent to our office was of a June 1966 observation. If you had reported your observation to the nearest Air Force at the time, detailed investigation would have been undertaken. It is extremely difficult to investigate a sighting which is more than a month or so old.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. I have enclosed the 1967 report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force unidentified flying objects program.

Dear [redacted]:

I have reviewed the information which you provided on your observation of 12 June 1966. We feel that the Altair Altair was the probable cause of your sighting. Altair was on an azimuth of 100 degrees at an elevation of 25 degrees at the time of your sighting. Because of the stationary position and length of observation, Altair seems to be the probable stimulus for your observation.

The attached extract from Light & Colour in the Open Air, by M. Minnesart should explain why different stars appear to change their colors.

I hope you found the material which we forwarded to you on 28 June interesting. If you need further information, please feel free to write and ask us. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

[The rest of the text is handwritten and partially illegible, but appears to include responses to various questions on a form about a UFO sighting, including details about location, time, direction, and movement of an observed object.]

Some legible handwritten responses include:
- Question 27 (What were you doing at the time): Appears to mention something about driving and looking
- Question 31 (Degrees from North): "don't know"

The form has multiple sections with checkboxes and spaces for written responses, typical of a UFO sighting report document from Project Blue Book.

22. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to the high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

23. In the following larger sketch place an "A" in the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" in the position where you last saw it. Note the arrow to indicate the direction of the object's movement.

The page contains two diagrams illustrating these instructions, with sketches showing different perspectives of an object's movement and position relative to the horizon and landscape.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted], 21 March 1967

Dear [redacted]

Reference your recent letter reporting an unidentified flying object observation of last summer. At this late date, it would be extremely difficult to make a comprehensive evaluation of the sighting. It is most important that we receive the reports at the earliest possible date.

The only possible explanation that I could give at this time would be that the sighting has the characteristics of an aircraft refueling mission. Such refueling exercises have been responsible for numerous UFO sightings in the past.

Enclosed is some information which should be of interest.
