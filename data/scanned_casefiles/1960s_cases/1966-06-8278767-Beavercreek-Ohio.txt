Text extracted from the document:

"Please excuse our delay in answering your letter of 9 February 1967 in which you reported your observation to the Air Force. With out essential data such as angular velocity, flight characteristics, duration of the sighting, etc., a comprehensive evaluation cannot be undertaken. If you had reported your June 1966 observation to the nearest Air Force Base, a detailed investigation would have been undertaken. It is extremely difficult to investigate a sighting which is more than a month or so old.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force."

Dear Sirs:
I do not recall observing anything unusual or strange on the evening of May 31, 1962, as reported in the news media.
While it may have been unusual to some, what I observed was a normal and natural phenomenon which I have seen on many occasions. The bright light in the sky was not a strange or unnatural occurrence, but rather a normal astronomical event which is not uncommon.
I hope this clarifies the matter and provides the information you requested. Please let me know if you need any additional details.
Sincerely,

P.S. Would you please return the Kodak "Instamatic" camera that I loaned to you a few days ago as I need it again. "Act G like a book!"

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Please excuse our delay in answering your letter in which you requested information to the Air Force...

Without essential data such as angular velocity, flight characteristics, duration of the sighting, etc., however, a comprehensive evaluation cannot be undertaken. The form you sent to our office has not been returned. If the information requested on the form had been furnished, a detailed investigation would have been undertaken. It is extremely difficult to investigate a sighting which is more than a month or two old.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. I have included the 1967 report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force unidentified flying object program.

Sincerely,

Concerning your question on this, I saw another flash of light about a mile to the north northeast at the same spot. The object appeared to be hanging motionless for 3 minutes or so in a brilliant light. Apparently it went off in the same direction It had come but at a much higher speed and seemed to slowly disappear in the distance.

I have told you of everything I have seen concerning this. Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you,

A brilliant light in the sky, like a searchlight, moving across the sky not more than 1000 ft high, but the light had no beam or cone of light coming from it, the light itself traveled across the sky, would become very bright and then dull, green like a glowing star. The only noise was a slight hum as it passed overhead, it would make sudden stops and changes in direction, one time it seemed to shoot straight up and disappear out of sight.

Dayton, Ohio 45430 
Dear

I have reviewed the information which you provided on your observation of a strange aerial object on 12 June 1966. We feel that the case appears to be the probable sighting of a meteor or high-flying aircraft.

The attached extracts from "Flight & Colour in the Open Air," by W. A. Lethbridge, may explain why different observers would describe a similar object in such varying ways. I hope you found the material which we forwarded to you on 23 June informative. Please feel free to write and ask us. Thank you for reporting your observation.

Sincerely,

NEWTON QUINTANILLA, Ir. Major, USAF

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

The text in the document reads:

"No case info only
Proposed reply to letter from -----, 21 March 1967

Dear -----,
Reference your recent letter reporting an unidentified flying object observation on last summer. At this late date, it would be extremely difficult to make a comprehensive evaluation of the sighting. It is most important that we receive the reports at the earliest possible date.
The only possible explanation that I could give at this time would be that the sighting has the characteristics of an aircraft traveling machine. Such traveling exercises have been responsible for numerous UFO sightings in the past.
Enclosed is some information which should be of interest.
