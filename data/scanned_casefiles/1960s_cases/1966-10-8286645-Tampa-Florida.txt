11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer reported eleven UFOs during a three hour period. The object, were larger than the lights on passing aircraft. The ten "donut-shaped" objects were alternating various colors. The eleventh UFO was described as a circle of white light. The first UFO, referred as the mother ship, reportedly shot out a flash of green light.

There has been a rash of sightings in the area and local astronomers have pointed out that people are most likely seeing the star, Canopus, and the planet Jupiter. Echo I passed north of the area at 0556Z and appears to be the white circle of light the witness reported.
