Dear Sir:

On the evening of January 8, 1966, at approximately 6:45 PM EST, I observed an unidentified flying object over Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. The object was seen hovering and maneuvering for approximately 15 minutes.

The object appeared to be round or elliptical in shape, with a metallic or highly reflective surface. It was emitting a bright white light, and at times seemed to change color, appearing to be greenish or bluish in hue. The object was quite large, estimated to be at least 50-75 feet in diameter.

The object remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and executed several sharp turns and maneuvers, changing direction abruptly. It then appeared to climb at a steep angle and disappear from view.

I have been a resident of this area for many years and am quite familiar with various aircraft and weather phenomena. This object exhibited characteristics that I have never before witnessed, and I am convinced that it was not a conventional aircraft, weather balloon, or any other known object.

I would appreciate any information your office may have regarding this sighting, or any similar incidents that have been reported in this region. Please let me know if you require any additional details from me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
