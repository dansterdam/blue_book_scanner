From [redacted]                                                   1/11/66
To Air Force Chief of Staff ATTN: Blue Book White House 29 D.C.

Dear Sir:

I am writing to tell you about a strange incident that occurred to me on the night of January 7th near Lewisburg. I was driving at 2:900 I suddenly noticed a strange object at Lewisburg and not quite far from the highway. I was driving along with two wings spread out. The two wings appeared to be glowing and I was sitting at the wheel wondering what it could be. It was a quiet night and I was alone.

[Note: Some words are difficult to read precisely due to handwriting, so this is my best interpretation of the text.]

Dear Mr. Martin:

Well, again about 3:00 am this time, might then appear I saw one of those flying put-to-the-time that he would fly the army from some place in said city. I felt a couple times I could just get out of the way. I was just at the end I could see I was getting away. The length I went to I want to tell other people.

I thought while I was all you about this, so if you could and have some to write it and might tell me of your particular opinion of him.

Sincerely,

[The signature and name are blacked out]
