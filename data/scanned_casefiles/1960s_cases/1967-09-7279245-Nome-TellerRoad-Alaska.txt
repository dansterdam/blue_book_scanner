Some we consider on the car to record our lights and we see the car was in a place of light to the rear. We thought the approaching car was gone and we could still.

For a short time we didn't see the flashing, then we saw a bright light in front and to the right and [partially illegible text].

"There's a light, but, at her starfall."

"But there is a road over there," replied Mrs. Blockett who had traveled within way many miles before.

Nothing for came from the rear and now our attention was given to the reddish-gray light in front and to the right at a distance.

The terrain characteristics is a flat barren exposed area all in the car driving so we could see which also is in the direction of the Bering Sea.

The light to the front seemed like a ball; fire and seemed to rise up at an angle of 45 degrees and seemed to come toward us. It was a sort eerie feeling.

We consulted with each other as to what we saw and tried to calm all in all we observed it from 10:05 to 11:30 p.m. [partially illegible signature/date]

The light seemed to move back and forth in the air probably several hundred or more above the ground. We wondered if it had gone over us. It moved and then some but softly back and forth as though hovering or observing. The light was in one mass, at times of blue light were given off from the top. It also rose some from the top up. It seemed to flash in length it were flickering. It was a football but more rounded at the ends. At one point it seemed to have a tail.

We watched it through the open door of an old log wall to frame the [rest of text partially cut off]
