The first time this phenomenon was sighted the son saw it first and then called his mother and father's attention to it.

The second time, the phenomenon was sighted the son yelled to his mother from the yard, and his mother saw the phenomenon from the upstairs window. The father was in the house during the second sighting.

Both times the disk moved to a particular position and a piece broke off. The place was turning and its path was to the right at a greater angle than the man's face. The disc diminished in size as it traveled.

April 7,1969

Dear Sirs:
I am an amateur astronomer and would like for your department to offer an explanation to a UFO sighting made on the evening of April 7,1969. They objects were traveling in a pair and were quite close together (barely observable with the naked eye but telescopic observation with a 2.4 inch refractor under 35x and fair seeing conditions confirmed that there were two objects.) I was doing my homework when I looked out my window and saw a very bright object moving very slowly within 4 to 5 degrees of the planet Jupiter. I always keep my telescope ready in my bedroom and I went outside on my porch (for it was 72° outside and when I looked towards Jupiter the object was there.) I stood watching it's course for about 10 or 15 seconds and rushed inside to get my telescope and mounted it on the porch. It is an azal altazimuth mounting and thus I can find and track moving objects with ease. Under 35x the two objects were clearly defined. They were points of light yet their visual magnitude was brighter than -3. It outshone Jupiter easily in the dusk and followed straight path from Jupiter to 3 to 4 degrees was from Alioth, the first star in the handle of Ursa Major.
After it had traveled 1/4 of the distance mentioned above, it started to fluctuate in magnitude, gradually dimming as it traveled its course.
After it had passed 1/2 of it's course, it began to fluctuate violently in magnitude but still keeping a steady course. It was about 35 degrees from the horizon looking to the east. It traveled along its path for approximately two minutes before vanishing beneath Alioth. When it was

[Note: The last paragraph appears to be cut off at the bottom of the page]

Here is the text from the document:

% of it's course from one peck of brightness to another was about
10 seconds. While 3/4 of it's journey was completed the crests were
very irregular. When it was within 15 degrees of Alioth it was very
faint and soondisappeared. It was not visible for about 5 seconds
but reappeared under Alioth for about 4 seconds.

The object was first sighted at 7:40 P.M. Dayton time
and vanished 2 minutes later. The objects were at a very high altitude
yet they couldn't be weather ballons because of the large amount of
light emitted.

Please reply as soon as possible or what your opinion is
and I am sure that the other witness would verify this statement.

Sincerely Yours,

[Handwritten text: Heading NORTH]

Observed under 35x with 2.4 inch Altazimuth refractor. It moved in a straight path from Jupiter to the star Alioth, the first star in the handle of the Big Dipper. It appeared right below Jupiter at ~3 magnitude. It completely outshone Jupiter.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH.

As I am still learning, basis of Astronomy, I have not yet covered angular dimensions so I would say it covered 3/4 of the match head with the naked eye.

The objects resembled Jupiter because of the flat disk-like appearance yet they appeared smaller but quite brighter. They differed in the fact that Jupiter has an orange color and surface details while the objects were white and no apparent details but there were two objects and were considerably brighter than Jupiter.

MEMO FOR RECORD                                                11 Apr 69

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Reported by Thomas Mortimer

On 10 Apr 69, Mr. [redacted] was called to report a UFO sighting.
The following information was received on the sighting:

Date: 10 Apr 69
Time: 1527 Hrs EST
Location: [redacted] Drive
Duration: About 3 Seconds
Noise: Like a jet or rocket
Description: Grayish circular object that seemed to be at tree top
level. Observer looking toward W-NAS3 and object seemed to be going
north. (Observer was very young and seemed nervous)

Action: Called Mr. Lawson of Base PAA. Mr. Lawson stated that
observer probably saw one of two P-84's that left Dayton for Springfield
and were in the area of the sighting at the time of the observation.

I then called the observer and informed him that he had probably seen
one of the P-84's. The observer then said, "Oh - OK - Goofy."
