Operation "Bluebook"
Weight Patterson AFB
Dayton,Ohio

April 7,1969

Dear Sirs:

I am an amateur astronomer and would like for your department to give me an explanation for a UFO sighting I made on the evening of April 7,1969. The objects were traveling in a pair and were quite close together (barely observable with the naked eye but telescopic observations confirmed that there were two objects). I was doing my homework when I looked out my window and saw a very bright object moving very slowly. When I looked again, it had disappeared. I always keep my telescope ready in my bedroom and I went "outside on my porch (for it was 72" outside and I wanted less distraction) and I took out my telescope and pointed it at the area where I had seen the object disappear. It's course was for about 10 or 15 seconds and I pushed inside to get my telescope and mounted it on the porch. It is an EAL astronomical mounting and I swing with ease. Under 35x the two objects were clearly defined. They were points of light yet their visual magnitude was brighter than -3. It outshone Jupiter easily from where I was looking. After it had travelled a of the distance of its course, it began to fluctuate in magnitude, gradually diminish as it traveled its course. After it had passed 3/4 of its course, it began to fluctuate violently in magnitude but still remained in sight. If was about 35 degrees above the horizon looking to the east. It traveled along its path for approximately two minutes before vanishing toward Alloth. When it vanished, it did so gradually, telescope still trained on it.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text in the document is as follows:

"4 of it's course from one peek of brightness to another was about 10 seconds. While 3/4 of it's journey was completed the crates were very irregular.when it was within 15 degrees of Alloth it was very much discollapsedisappeared. It reappeared within 5 seconds but reappearedunder Alloth for about 4 seconds.

The object was first sighted at 7240 a.m. Dayton time and vanished 2 minutes later.The objects were at a very high altitude yet they couldn't be weather balloons because of the large amount of light emitted.

Please reply as soon as possible or what your opinion is and I am sure that the other witness would verify this statement.

Sincerely Yours,"

Observed under 35x with 2.4 inch Altasinoeh refractor. It 
moved in a straight path from Jupiter to the star Altair, the 
total distance covered this short trip. The pattern showed first 
a pulsating motion, then a darkening and expanding. The object 
was about the angular size of a match. I have not yet covered 
this experiment by the methods covered by the literature.

MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting Reported by Thomas Mortimer
On 10 Apr 69, Mr. Mortimer called to report a UFO sighting. The following information was received on the sighting:
Date: 10 Apr 69
Time: 1257 hrs EST
Location: Fay Drive, Dayton, Ohio
Direction: About 3 seconds north
Noise: Like a jet or rocket
Description (Drawing): A bright white/silver object that seemed to be at tree top level. Object seemed to be going north. (Observer was very young and seemed nervous).
Action: Called Mr. Lawson of Base SSA. Mr. Lawson stated that the observer probably saw one of the F-4s that just left Wright-Patterson for training.
I then called the observer and informed him that he had probably seen one of the F-4s. The observer then said, "Oh - Ok - Goodbye".
