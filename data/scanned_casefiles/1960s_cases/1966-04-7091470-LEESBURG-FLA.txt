Dear Sirs:-

On Friday, around 3 P.M. on either the 22nd or the 24th of April, (this year) I was working in my garden, when I heard a "yell", just looked up. It was coming toward me from a northerly direction going South. It was about 1500 ft. from me and I could see it was moving very plainly as it came toward me.

Of height, beside the fact, in color, it was two very small (compared to the sky) - a reality of that I couldn't

Here is the OCR text from the document:

rec. that leaving two small
dark very distinctly controlled
jets on the right was al-
ready absent. at the jet when
I first slowed up that the
one on the left was spent
coming up - they were very
close to the jet one might
say "hugging it." when the
left one died came abreast of
the place, they sixth left us
very abruptly, made a large
arc to the left - about 300
yds - and spiraled up -
and I'm assuming - out
of sight, once at the top of
the arc or spent the contrails
"shut off" abruptly. they faded
with the side, left trailing.

This, but it occurred to me

That the pilots, or pilots, of the jet might have related the story, and had no one to corroborate it.

Yours very truly,
