The image contains a sketch, but no photograph. The sketch shows a curved line with various points labeled on it, as well as a compass rose. The text below the sketch instructs the viewer to "Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course."

OCR output:
27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten text entry on a page from a Project Blue Book report. The text appears to be in response to a questionnaire, but there is no image visible in the provided image.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: February 15, 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or your own explanation of your sighting:

The sighting occurred at corner of E and Front, date - at corner is a driveway where the object was sighted - it was a clear night and there was very little else in the sky - the object was first seen emerging from a bank of trees in the distance and approached rapidly in the sky, seemed to be moving on a fairly level plane, and, as it reached a point almost directly overhead, made a rather rapid climb and went out of sight, with complete silence - there was no correlation of any kind whatsoever with any known type of aircraft, guided missiles, Satelites, or anything else - it was sighted by two people independently at the same time and place, and proved to be the most startling and unexplained object we have ever seen.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report documenting a UFO sighting in Ramona, California on 12 August 1965.

Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla
4 June 1965

It occurred at a small airport and the duration was one and one-half minutes. Follow-up should have been made to determine whether there were other potential witnesses. Sighting is considered as unidentified. Witnesses available. Must be carried as unidentified, single witness.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.
A single witness reported seeing a round white light that hovered at 5,000 feet at 9:00 p.m. The witness was a 67-year-old lady. The light was observed for three minutes and then it disappeared. Witness said sighting occurred at a sight and that it was still reasonably bright. Witness said sighting occurred at night and that the light was similar to a very bright star. The witness was sure the object was not a star.

16. 16 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire.
I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire, a case. See attached supplemental sheet A.

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit Dayton.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Dover Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, I am requesting a copy of the Air Force investigation of same. I suggest the sighting is obviously unidentified based on NICAP report.

19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
I have only the card on this case, but judging from it there seems by the description that this thing was observed by 1 or more persons for 10 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Leoa, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it.

Honorable Sir:
Your indulgence, please.

MY husband, Mr. -- an avid reader of Popular Science, for the first time heard of the "Unidentified Flying Objects" and read with great interest your "Condon Report".

He mentioned to me that there were many new episodes which intrigued me. Into writing this letter, I have read and read open-end encounters of yours and how it was "covered up" by the one photographed by the TV newsman was on August 12, 1965.

Our cat "Cleo", usually perches herself on our rooftop, and I went out to get her. I was astonished at the sky, the clouds were the most beautiful blue blue, with many peculiar formations. Suddenly, from the corner of my eye, in the immediate Hill beautiful blue blue, with many peculiar formations. Suddenly, from the corner of my eye, in the immediate field of my vision, I saw an object no more than thirty feet in diameter, silvery with an appear-ance of metal structure, with no lights, no vapor trail, no sound, emerging from a cloud of white, and accelerating from a slow speed to a very high speed and disappearing into another cloud. Soon after this object disappeared, the sky became clear of unusual cloud configurations. Secondly, from the southwest, since the power line towers at the corner hide any distant view, I like to observe the sky. On this particular evening, I observed a perfectly straight line of light, silver in color, perhaps thirty feet long, moving at a high rate of speed from the southwest to the northeast, until it disappeared. This occurred on September 3, 1965.

I am quite aware no one would believe me, and it appears to have been one of those temporary hallucinations, but remember, I did not seek these events; they came to me. I realize that people in this community, too, today most peoples remain within and in fact, I too, may have missed all of those who have It not been my wish to find these clear signs. Thank you very much for your indulgence and the more you know. Seasons greetings and success in 1966.

Sincerely yours,
[signature redacted]
