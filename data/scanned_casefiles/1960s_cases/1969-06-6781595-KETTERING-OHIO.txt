Re: Questions 2 & 3. - First noticed object from our front window (facing east) at 9:45 p.m. I watched it for a few minutes. Again from our kitchen window (facing west) at 2:45 a.m. I watched object again for a few minutes. It was the same object because of its color, brightness, shape, etc. I called my son to look at object. We watched it steadily & decided to phone U.P.A.F.B. locally. I made notes after calling the base. I referred to these notes when filling out this report.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

UFO Observation - 8 Jun 1969

Kettering, Ohio 45429

Dear Mrs. Robbins:

We feel that your UFO observation of 8 June 1969 was of the planet Mars. At 5:15 a.m. EDT, Mars was at an angular elevation of 20 degrees. At an azimuth of 265 degrees and was on the horizon. GA 8 June 1969, Mars had a stellar magnitude of -1.4 and as such was brighter than all of the lesser objects except Jupiter.

Sincerely,
