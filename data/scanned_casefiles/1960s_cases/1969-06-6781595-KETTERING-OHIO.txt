Here is the text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

A COMPASS ROSE IS USED AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. BLACK "A" ON THIS COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

Object was bright - self-luminous - color alternated from amber to red. It appeared solid with well defined (sharp) edges. Its shape appeared to be round like a ball. It was much brighter than an average star. At one point it seemed that a parachute type object put in front of the phenomenon but I do not know if it was an illusion on my part due to steady viewing.

Ne: Questions 2+3. - I first noticed object from our front window (facing east) AT 9:45 p.m. I watched it for a few minutes. At 2:45 am. I spotted of object again from our kitchen window (facing west) I am pretty sure it was the same object because of its color, brightness, shape etc. I called my son to look at it. We watched it steadily + decided to phone W.P.A.F.B. Luckily I made notes after calling the base. I referred to these notes when filling out this report.
