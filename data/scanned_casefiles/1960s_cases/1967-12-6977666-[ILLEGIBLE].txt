Dear Sir,

I would like to report a citing of a U.F.O., over Staten Island on the night of Friday, December 1. I am speaking for my club of which most of them saw this object.

We (the club) were on the roof of the local Y.M.C.A. having a viewing session(our club is basically an astronomy club for younger boye) when 1 of the older boys called to my attention an object over Staten Island much brighter than a star and 4 times as big, the color was an orange-red and it was in the shape of a circle. The object came from behind a church steeple and headed directly for us, then it made a 90 degree turn to the north. Then it headed north and disappeared in a group of smokestacks. Several people saw this including myself,and one of the boys saw this thru a telescope but lost it because of it's rate of travel. We verify this to be the truth to the best of our knowledge and there is a diagram on the bottom of this page to show the path taken.

We would appreciate any help you can give us, on our observation.

Diagram on page following.

Thank you.

On the night of December 12,1967,at a little past 7:00 p.m. was watching television.I heard a loud noise,it was going over my house. I thought it was a jet,so I went to the kitchen window.I didn't see anything,so I went back into the den to watch television.17 years-old brother, was outside looking at the christmas lights.Suddenly,he came into the house saying "Come outside on the front porch and see!" I looked in the north,and I saw a red light.I could hear a noise,too.It was a closer look.I could see more features on it.It had two blue lights in the back and a red light that was flashing on and off was in the front.I obtained my neighbors and if there's if you find out that it was a "flying wing"let me know about it.

Gentlemen

At approximately 6:00 PM CST this day I sighted what is termed a flying saucer at approximately a 130° angle in the sky. It was about the size of a quarter but when spied through 4X10 Binoculars it appeared cigar shaped approximately one foot long and seemed to give off a glow very unlike a star. It remained in the sky visible for 20 minutes coming to a stop three times and abruptly changing course three times.

Can you tell me what it was?
