To Whom it may Concern:

I was reading the book "Flying a dream from Ocean to Ocean" when I came to this quotation which I am jotting out and sending to you, because on 1966 I sighted a strange object in the sky, like a silver, more than before. I am not saying that is more in action, but it may have been since. There are a lot of sun-glinting objects, which have been, flying and circling. I was not the only one who regarded it to the Peoria Dept. -ly. This is not enough information, but if you wish to know more, I will be glad to tell all I know.

Yours Truly
