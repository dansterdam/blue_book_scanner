The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document appears to be a report or statement regarding some type of unidentified aerial phenomena or UFO sighting. The handwritten text discusses details of the sighting and the observer's perspective on the event.

The text in the document is as follows:

"This is an account of an unidentified flying object of May 26, 1966 known to local authorities.

Flying object was sighted at approximate 1:00 am. Flying very low over location toward the Southwest. Hovering approximately 50 yards altitude. Bright light source or object emitting intense bright light, approximately 16-20 feet in diameter. Object remained in hovered position for approximately 2 minutes, then departed at very high speed toward the Southwest.

Witnesses include others not identified. Similar sightings have been reported in this rural area dating back to 1946 in this region. Observers reported in past that these appear extremely fast and with no sound. This report is submitted for Official USAF investigation."
