DETAILS OF SIAD SEPTEMBER 30
A. F/O FRANKLIN AND C. F. OLIVIER
   At 2345 hours on 30 September 1960 F/O FRANKLIN and C. F. OLIVIER were in the vicinity of Winchester Bay, Oregon when they observed an object in the sky.  The object was approximately 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground and was discernible only in the spotlight which was focused on it.  The object was described as being circular in shape, approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter, and having a bright reddish-orange luminous glow around the outer edge and a dull glowing red center.
   The object was under intelligent control and appeared to be descending toward the men. When it reached an altitude of approximately 500 feet, it suddenly accelerated and climbed out of sight at a tremendous rate of speed.
   It is the opinion of F/O FRANKLIN and C. F. OLIVIER that the object was an unidentified flying object. However, there is a possibility that they could have been seeing a conventional aircraft which was difficult to identify from their vantage point.

This image contains a photograph of a solar halo complex observed on September 17, 1960. The image is accompanied by a caption that provides some details about the observation, including the date, the observer's name (Edgar Everhart), and a brief description of the phenomenon.

The Solar Halo Complex of September 17, 1960
Last September 17th, the skies over Oregon were graced with a spectacle that left many observers in awe. Edgar Everhart, a professor at the University of Oregon, photographed an intriguing solar halo complex that day. The halo, which was observed through a 15-inch telescope, had an unusual shape and appeared to be composed of multiple concentric circles. The caption notes that this type of solar halo is a rare and fascinating atmospheric optical phenomenon.

MINISTER OF VENUS
The periodic appearance of the planet Venus has caused considerable speculation and interest in its possible observation at close range. This article discusses measurements of its disk with ordinary astronomical instruments and comments upon the significance of these findings.

CORRECTION
On page 17 of the November, 1960, issue, the diameter of the planet Venus was listed as 22.5 kilometers. This figure was in error. The correct diameter of Venus is 12,225 kilometers, or 7,600 miles.

1967 - New Air Research It

The observations of the disks of the inner planets made at the Steward Observatory in Tucson, Arizona, during 1965-1967 have yielded some interesting results. Ordinary astronomical telescopes, when used at reasonably high magnification, can reveal the apparent diameters of the planets out to Saturn and possibly beyond. More accurate determinations are obtained by photographic methods or by micrometric measurements using a filar micrometer.

The photographs and measurements indicate that the diameters of the major planets do not differ greatly from those previously accepted, except in the case of Venus which appears to be smaller than the accepted value. The observed diameters are as follows:

Mercury - 5.0 arcseconds 
Venus - 16.5 arcseconds
Mars - 9.7 arcseconds
Jupiter - 40.3 arcseconds
Saturn - 17.1 arcseconds

If these figures are converted to actual diameters the results are:

Mercury - 4,900 km
Venus - 12,225 km 
Mars - 6,900 km
Jupiter - 142,800 km
Saturn - 120,500 km

The diameter of Venus at 12,225 km is 600 km less than the usually accepted figure of 12,800 km. This smaller size of Venus has been confirmed by several observers and measurements. The measurements were made by photographic and micrometric methods, and were consistent over a period of two years.

The smaller diameter of Venus, if confirmed by further observations, would have significant effects upon our understanding of the planet. The mass would be slightly less, the surface gravity would be lower, and the mean density would be greater than previously estimated.

This revised diameter of Venus also has implications for the model of the atmosphere and the theoretical temperatures associated with the "greenhouse effect." The total energy received by the planet would be less, and the temperatures, in particular the maximum temperatures, would be lower than the values usually quoted.

The explanation for the smaller diameter remains uncertain. It is possible that the earlier accepted figure was in error, or that the more recent observations have detected some real effect, such as a contraction of the planet, a change in atmospheric conditions, or some other physical phenomenon not yet understood.

Further measurements and observations of Venus are clearly needed to resolve this question. The smaller diameter should be confirmed by other observers, and the implications for our understanding of the planet should be fully explored.

The provided image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book UFO report. The diagram shows a diagram with various directions and labels, and the text appears to be a detailed description of the sighting.

Text from the document:

The case here identifies the features generally on the drawing but we have no visual record of the UFO. The object was described as being luminous and changing in color from red to green and white. It appeared to be elliptical in shape, and was observed for several minutes from 11:15 p.m. to 11:20 p.m. on August 6, 1960 in the vicinity of Winchester Bay, Oregon.

The object was first sighted by four individuals: Mr. A, Mr. B, Mr. C, and Elizabeth, a young girl of 12 years old. Mr. A was the first to see the object and call the attention of the others to it. The object was described as being luminous and changing in color from red to green and white. It appeared to be elliptical in shape.

The object was observed for several minutes, from 11:15 p.m. to 11:20 p.m. It was first seen in the northwest, then moved to the west, then to the southwest. It remained fairly stationary in the southwest for a period of time. The witnesses estimated the size of the object to be about 1/3 the size of the full moon. No sound was heard.

The case is listed as Unidentified.

Findings from Mercury's Transit
Joseph Ashbrook

Observations of the transit of Mercury across the sun's disk were made from 128 stations in 18 countries on November 7, 1960. The observed start and completion times of the transit are given in Universal Time for each station.

The data is being analyzed by the director of the American Ephemeris, the scientific calculations of planetary motions. Resulting in the most complete data available for this century's four transits of Mercury. A surprisingly large number of experienced observers in 28 stations obtained visual and photographic observation of the transit, despite the difficulties involved.

Photographic and visual observations showed considerable variations in the duration of the transit. These variations are believed to be real, and are attributed to various atmospheric conditions at the stations, and also perhaps to instruments and observing techniques.

The transit of November 7, I960 offers valuable information about the various methods of observing this phenomenon, which periodically occur in rare intervals of more than a century.

Contact Dr. J. Ashbrook, Harvard College Observatory, for contact regarding further information.
