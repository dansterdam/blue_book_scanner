10. CONCLUSION
Sighting: Other (CONFLICTING DATA)
Photo: (FOREIGN MATTER ADHERING TO THE NEGATIVE)
Observers sighted and photographed a red friley object.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
One observer (age 9) said he saw the object for 3 minutes, that the object didn't pass in front or behind anything and indicated that the object traveled in a fairly straight course. Another observer (age 10) stated that she saw the object for 9 seconds, that it passed both in front of and behind clouds and that it definitely did not travel in a straight line.

Photo experts determined that the object seen in the print was caused by foreign matter adhering to the negative at the time of printing, thus, the object was only imaged on the print.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: Ventnor, New Jersey                DATE: April 1967

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF                IR                           QUALITY

P NRS: One Original 3 x 3 Negative; One 1 x 3 Contact Prints; One 8 x 10 Enlargement of Original Negative.
Contact Prints: One 8 x 10 Enlargement of Original Negative.

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order 67-121, submitted by Major H. Quintanilla requesting that photo analysis be accomplished on the accompanying contact print and negative to determine what the unidentified object reported in the photo may be.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the negative, and an 8 x 10 enlargement of same, revealed no object which could be equated to the object circled on a contact print purportedly from the same negative. Possibly dust or some other object came in contact with the negative at the time of printing and was imaged on the print.
