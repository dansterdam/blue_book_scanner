The image appears to contain a diagram or schematic of some kind, but no photograph. The diagram shows a circular shape with a central point labeled "B" and several radiating lines or spokes extending from it. There is also some accompanying text, but no human faces are visible in the image.

Using optical character recognition (OCR), the text in the document can be extracted as follows:

24. On the photograph, Identify those objects or aircraft which were observed as shown. Show direction of motion, shape, size, estimated altitude, and color if possible, or otherwise describe them in detail. Include the number of objects seen, time of observation, and give other pertinent details.
