10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
CIRVIS report of round spinning object to the right of the North Star. Chang-ing color red, white blue and green, 45 dgr elevation. Also had black object that appeared to be with it.

11. COMMENTS
Duration excessive. Object stationary and still in sight. No photos taken. Balloon should move out in hour's time but possibility cannot be discounted. Sounds like astro body without the black object being associated; however, there should be some movement to the West. This explanation could not be accounted for by "specialists". Observation to North Star, which also moves. Case considered as insufficient data.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

21: Honolulu, Hawaii - A researcher, civil engineer and manufacturer's representative, observed a bright-lighted UFO which passed over a straight course, east to west, above Honolulu harbor. It was visible 30 seconds. Earlier the same day a huge disc-shaped UFO was reported by its Pacific fleet. After pilots others to investigate.

(Note: Some words are partially illegible due to the poor image quality, so I've transcribed the text as best I could)
