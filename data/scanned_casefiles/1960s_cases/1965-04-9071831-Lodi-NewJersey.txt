Dear Sirs,
Tonight, my brother and I were both outside witnessing I saw something in the sky. I first thought I was mistaken, but it was too bright and too late for it to be some star. We were very interested in what we saw. Any explanation would be appreciated.

The text on this page is mostly illegible. There is a faint line of text at the top of the page that begins with "...OF APR. 12 SOUTH OF LODI..." but the rest of the text is too blurry or faint to read with certainty. The rest of the page appears to be blank or extremely faded.
