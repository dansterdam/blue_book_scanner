DAYTON DAILY NEWS
DID FLYING PENTAGON
ON GEMINI 10 ASTRONAUTS
By JACK JONES, Daily News Staff Writer
Gemini 10 astronauts John W. Young and Michael Collins brought back an unidentified object from space with them on their recent flight, it was learned today.
THE ODD THING is that the object does not seem to be found.
The astronauts' report on this "saucer" or whatever it was that they saw and photographed during their three-day mission has not been made public. Life magazine attempted to explain them away, but found the explanation left a lot to be desired.
THERE IS LITTLE doubt that the astronauts saw something. There have been other reports of unusual aerial phenomena observed by space travelers, indicating they do pick up strange sightings in the sky which official sources have not yet explained.
To test the letter theory, staff photographers mounted a camera with a telescopic lens on the roof of the Dayton Daily News building and got a picture of the planet Venus, showing it to be about the same size and shape as the object the astronauts photographed.
Well, here goes that "man-in-the-moon" stuff away.

"Children Escaped Previously

Girl Found Unharmed

'VISITOR FROM SPACE'—Betty Jean Klem, 16, and three friends were sitting in their car at Presque Isle State Park near Erie, Pa., when they say they sighted a 'flying saucer'. Betty said, 'It came down', but that was all she said. It was appeared to be a formation of glowing lights that hovered for several minutes and then shot straight up out of sight. Betty notified an Air Force security patrol, who referred all queries to the Air Force Secretary."

Flying Saucer No Hoax, Erie Police Chief Says 
Girl Hysterical After Seeing It On Presque Isle
ERIE, PA., July 21--[AP]--Erie's police chief said today that a flying saucer report near Presque Isle State Park, which he described as "something I had been sighted by 13-year-old Betty Jean Klein of Jamestown, N.Y., and three companions, Douglas Tibbets of Greenbrush, N.Y.
Others See It
They were among a small group of people who reportedly saw a bright light descend between two trees on Presque Isle Peninsula Sunday. 
A radar at the radar and UFO reports followed the incident.
Two state police officers in scientific apparatus were reported seeing a bright light hovering above the ground and then vanishing abruptly. Maj. William Hall views print attributed to UFO, purportedly found with gluster to form mold for study.

4:15 to 5:25 a.m. One of the witnesses said the object turned red, disappeared, reappeared and turned white.
Another unexplained bright object was reported, moving slowly at an altitude of about 2,000 feet, observed by about eight persons on a beach near Erie. One of the witnesses, an Erie radio station--said they watched it for about 10 minutes during which period it changed direction several times.
Saw Another Day Before
Sighted said they also saw an unidentified object at about the same time and place the next day.
Spokesmen at Bald Plane, an Arthur Rapp for program director, told of the possibility of swatting from a satellite launc hing never back. 10 minute—we erratic change direction. Weather balloons were also ruled out.
Meanwhile, there were these developments in the investigation of the original sighting by Miss Kearns & Hall, an Air Force investigator, so several police made study of the TICO Pro ject where the models were sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton.
Dr. Marshal! Perrill, a professor of astronomy at Jamestown Community College, Dr. Marshall Stewart, en physics instructor, and Miss Ticlic, a member of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, examined the data.
(NICAP) members were investigating the report.

INTERVIEWING NCO: Earl W. Schroeder, Sgt. USAF
Niagara Falls International Airport
Niagara Falls, New York 14306

After carefully analyzing the facts as told to us by the people in this case, this statement from personal observation of the people and the situation, this could very well be a hoax connected by two of the principal persons involved, and I have reason to believe the saw the thing - that is in my opinion, and as such I do not believe the whole thing.

Being a native of this area and having spent a good share of my life training and raining in this area, I believe that the so called "monster" (if there was such) could very well have been a large black bear. Some of the facts that bring me to this conclusion are as follows:

1. All four principals involved stated it was a clear night in the sky. There was no mention of the moon which in 31 July 1966 was full.

2. During the week of 26 July the local TV stations showed a presubstantial black bear which was captured near this area. This makes me think that a black bear could very well have been in this area at the time of this incident.

3. Things that were observed were consistently absent during the incident and may have augmented by hasty or limited observation.

4. When first observed, as she states "monster", she could very well have seen a large black bear which at that distance and time of night could have been mistaken for something unusual.

5. He stated that he knew the beach and beach area very well, he could have very well recognized a black bear at that distance and those minutes and the distance between Jamestown and the beach is approximate 30 miles.

6. The only persons whose statements agree on exact times of the two disappearances of the vehicle is the two are boy and girl-friend.

The craft hovered silently and did not make any sound. After about 1 hour, the lights came on again and the craft slowly rose straight up until it disappeared from view. My witnesses gave full reports to the State Police Station and I spent most of the morning contacting them in their homes and interviewing them as to the details of their sightings. All the witnesses are reliable people of good standing who could not be influenced by any self-serving motives. The craft was described as elliptical or oval in shape, about 30 feet in diameter, aluminum or light grey in color, and absolutely silent in operation. It hovered about 30 feet above the ground and the witnesses could see no protrusions, wings, markings, or any other details that would identify the craft."

Cont. UFO Report Per AFR 200-2

Statement

A police lead the following chain of events. At 9:30PM 8 probable UFO sightings become described. Gerald said he parked his car at 9:40PM with his wife and daughter in the car. As they watched the object's maneuvers, USAF police officers arrived. The car had stopped to offer help. The police informed the witnesses that help had been sent for and they should continue to observe the objects which were lighting up the sky. The witnesses were there with food still on table about 20' away around some bushes. There were 10 to 15 additional witnesses in the area. The lights stopped around 10:15 PM. The police returned to their car near the picnic table. The witnesses and police departed car and walked nearly 300 yards when the witness said the object he had watched previous is still visible in the northern sky. The object was big and round, no windows, no ports, no arms like appendages, no hands, no face visible, as though it were a solid frame. The lights were not turned on. The witnesses and police ran back to their car to continue observation. They returned to stalled car, searched areas around picnic table with flashlight and case covered. Unidentified flying object could not be located. The witnesses returned with friends from Erie with car to aid, and deputies remained to answer questions from the Erie carload, but no further light object appears. Incident occurred at 0630AM, just after full daylight. 2 other patrolmen were at scene of incident shortly after, having no knowledge of area designated by Tibbetts according to statement. Tibbetts and witnesses were at least nervous as they were excited at time. They had no apparent fear and were fascinated by what they had witnessed as the UFO maneuvered immediately above them. A police report comments of measuring sound heard prior to object was not significant. According to Officer Tibbetts, the object seemed to disappear into thin air, windows up and doors locked while he saw the patrolmen walked away. The further observance was ended when the officer glanced the light again and it appears to have blown the light leaving a flash. Tibbetts said he saw the object and when he saw the light, "I blew the light".  He told Mrs. (?) Tibbetts "not to look." I have no reasonable explanation of the sighting and believe the object requested from this picture was the one at the scene. It seems to me the park has many of them that regularly visit picnic sites.

REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

At approximately 0130 hours on July 8, 1966, Patrolman Timothy P. O'Malley was on routine patrol at Presque Isle State Park, Erie, Pennsylvania, when he sighted an unidentified flying object. Patrolman O'Malley observed the object from the east end of the Park, near the Perry Monument.

The object was described as circular in shape, with a brilliant white light in the center, and a colored, pulsating ring around the outer edge. The object appeared to be hovering approximately 100 feet above the ground and approximately 500 yards from the observer's position. Patrolman O'Malley watched the object for approximately 5 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.

No sound was heard from the object during the observation.

Patrolman O'Malley immediately reported the sighting to the Pennsylvania State Police, Erie Barracks. The report was forwarded to the United States Air Force, Project Blue Book.

The lights seemed to hover just above the ground for a few seconds. As the object moved, the lights on it changed color. The object then shot straight up into the night sky and disappeared.

The ground was scattered with debris after the object left. Some of the debris appeared to be pieces of metal.

Recommendations:
1. Instructions be issued to investigating Air Force personnel to take additional data. The distortion of the true orientation of the two shapes would have been available to show them to be located in other than a mere coincidence.
2. It is suggested that an appointed member of the Civil Perceptions or Radio Section, Technical Branch, be called upon every time a UFO sighting, A/P/CG/OTH, has suggested that this course could be employed. Such appointment should be authorised in writing in a formal manner: a more accurate estimated weight acting on the disturbance can be made in the investigation of future reported cases.
3. It is mandatory that a more accurate layout of the photograph. Pieces of string tied to photograph can serve as valuable reference lines. At the minimum, a straight line should be drawn bisecting the photograph through the center. The reason for this line is that an accurate diagram can be reconstructed to show the angle of approach and relative altitude of the UFO, depending on the particular case, no record whatever was made of the angular measurement, which handicap in the analysis of the evidence.

ATTN OF: FDFM/Mr. J. Parker/55027	8 August 1966

SUBJECT: Evaluation of Depressions Found in Beach Sand in Presque Isle, Pennsylvania

TO: Major M. Quintanilla, Jr., FDTDR

The Landing Gear Group of the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory was requested to investigate a report of depressions found in the beach sand at Presque Isle State Park, Pennsylvania. The investigation of the location of the depressions did not confirm any unusual phenomena. The following summarizes the investigation and conclusions:

Conclusions:
1. According to the investigating USAF officer, the sand was definitely compressed under load and not excavated as might have been.
2. Assuming that the depressions were made by an applied load, the investigators that the depression was 7x0-1000 lbs. since no information was given on the size of the applied load.
3. According to Mr. Max Groff, EWPE, of Base Civil Engineering at Boiling AFD, depressions of this type could leave an inverted three-sided pyramid footprint. However, no visible or contour footprints were found in the location, which eliminates this potential explanation.
4. The layout of the three footprints showed no similarities to aircraft landing gear or support equipment which might have caused depressions.
5. Based on the number of depressions and their orientation, it is not likely that they served as ground-stabilizing contact points for any kind of platform or provide some form of symmetry in their location is basically illogical.

ANALYSIS TEST REPORT
ANALYTICAL SECTION

SUBJECT: Analysis of Sand from Erie, Pennsylvania related to UFO

SUBMITTED BY: William F. Morley, Jr., ASSTX, POX 

ANALYSIS: Analysis sandy material that is bound together to determine the nature of this binding. A particle, similar to the particles seen in plastic vials and about 10 pounds of sand for analysis. Three of the vials were labeled "A" and two vials were labeled "B".  

The ten pounds of sand was submitted in a large pasteboard box. The sand was examined in microscopic detail and a strong ultraviolet light was used, a search for luminescent or fluorescent particles. The test for the urea in urine was performed by heating a portion of the sand and observing the color, odor and emitting hydroxides.

The sand and other material were heated and in every case the silicate turned blue indicating that it has been formed. This was a positive test that the urea was present in the sand. Other modifications to the sand were observed during the tests. The chloroform was extracted with the chloroform. The chloroform was evaporated but no residue remained.  

The sand in the box contained several pieces of sand bonded together. One of the pieces of bonded sand was placed under ultraviolet light and another piece was put on the microscope stage to be studied visually.

A sample of chloroform and the bonding substance dissolved. The activity of the bonded sand was examined. An identification was made and reported verbally to Lt. Morley of the USAF that he had just received a report on this sand which had been examined for its properties and analysis.

ANALYSIS TEST REPORT
SUBJECT: TEST NO:
SUBMITTED BY: DATE RECEIVED: 
PURPOSE:
FACTUAL DATA: The organic resin that was identified came from the investigations and photo casts of the indentations. This is a good opportunity to emphasize the importance of taking a portion of the sand in the box which appeared to be the uncontaminated by acrylic resin. The chloroform was used to extract small residue remains which was identified by infrared spectroscopy as an acrylic resin. It is not unusual to find esters in the soil. 
CONCLUSIONS: The sand sample submitted in the plastic vials contained resin. However, this was not considered to be unusual. The acrylic resin originated from the investigator when the plastic mold of Paris casts of the indentations.

Cont. UFO Report Per AFR 200-2
The witness appeared creditable. He did state affirmative that one discussion if he was a policeman, he was wearing a borrowed police jacket at the time as early morning. This could have been caused by lack of detail to be associated to.
Park police placed a vehicle at the observers spot and cruised the roads to observe marshing vehicles with various light conditions to try to duplicate light conditions, but could not.
However, photographs established all night on the beach the following night saw a light and photographed it. Film is being forwarded to headquarters with photos.
1. Physical Evidence:
A physical evidence is questionable. Two triangular marks, about 18-20 inches apart or approximately 7" long were observed, made by Penna State Police. There is no evidence to actually establish any solid thing happened, except as described by the witness. The items pointed slightly down, and pushed into the sand, and evidence found in the form of angular surface about "4 - 6" below surface of sand, and pushed up to depth as deep as pushed up ridge. Smaller mark, similar to but not distinctly with any marks. An exam in photo, close up, will reveal more detail.
Some damp spots in the sand near by, which did not become noticeable until later, do not appear to have relationship to marks in photo. These appear to be unrelated to any thing seen.
Full cast of eastern hole is included, and partial cast or west hole, along with sand from general area.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

Both investigators (Major Hall - Captain Meier) reported discrepancies in the information available to them. The following is a listing of such factors:

1. Who actually saw "black shape"?
2. Description of object quite varied.
3. Who actually walked down beach?
4. The sounds heard varied.
5. Vibrations of car as alleged UFO settled to ground.
6. How did object disappear.
7. Why were persons getting ready to go swimming?
Miss _____ reports they were ready to leave for home at about 8:30.

8. Why were persons parking on that part of beach at this time?

Observers were watching the sky-from inside the parked automobiles - when noticed a bright star. Arcturus was on an azimuth of 275° at a 30° elevation at 1030 EDT, possibly accounting for this observation. Looking back there appears to be a "falling" of a object to the ground.

The girls say nothing but a light in the sky and a glow of light in the vegetation prior to observing the "black shape". One observer, however, provides a description of the alleged UFO. Only male observer allegedly saw object and described as oblong coming from the scenic table which leads to the belief that some animal was responsible for the "black shape" portion of the total picture.

There are numerous bears and raccoons in the area.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document, discussing conclusions drawn from an investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
1. No evidence exists to relate the damp areas and the indentations a the beach to the sighting. Considering the indentations, the following conclusions are presented:
a. No object could have made a stable landing without at least some appendages.
b. Sand should have been a lot more compressed for alleged landing.
c. No ground maneuver capability apparent.
d. Portions of ground indentations appear to have been uncovered, but they were totally compressed, as should have been.
e. No definite sign of vehicle departing area in the sand. No evidence of heat blast or sand being disturbed by aerodynamic vehicle.
f. Rough weight calculations indicate a weight of alleged object at approximately 1500 lbs. total weight. This being a static load estimate calculated anticipating a two-legged object.
g. Acrylic resin was present in the large sample taken around the indentation. This was attributed to the acrylic lacquer which was present on the indentations prior to casting the mold.
h. Urine was distinctly present in the soil samples.
2. Both Major Hall and Mr. Parmenter (Erie County Civil Defense) checked for existence of radioactivity. In both cases negative results were obtained.

AGENTS FOR RELEASE TO SAFOI

1. No correlation can be found to exist between the three facets of consideration: light - indentations - monster-light.

2. No evidence exists to relate the damp sandy areas and the indentation found on the beach to the visual sighting. Considering the terrain and evidence is present to indicate a landing of any type occurred (flight lab, W-PAFB). A chemical analysis of the soil samples was completed was nothing unusual in the sample except using CAF Material.

3. There is no evidence to substantiate the presence of a black monster. No unusual markings were found to indicate such a "thing" was observed in the area. 

4. As yet, there is no explanation of the lights that were observed. Considering observatory film taken of the lights, lasted approximate 3-5 seconds, the possible meteor as the explanation, however, they had no information of any meteors being observed at that time, and plane.s were contacted with the Park Police and nearby U.S. Coast Base for any unusual lights over the area. Negative results were received in both cases.

5. With the existing data no conclusive explanation can be made concerning the lights. It is assumed that no correlation existed between the lights, indentations, and the "alleged black monster".

Relayed above information to SAFOI on 8 August 66 at 1525.

Worthy of note is the fact that as object settled to the ground the case the object slowly disintegrating came a sudden crash noise. As the object approached approximately 300 - 400 yards in the distance, this was especially since the depth of the indentations were only about 1 - 5 inches in the ground.

Various discrepancies are noted throughout the available information. discrepancies are prevalent in the description of the alleged UFO and in the actual sequence of events as they occurred. Considering these discrepancies it is difficult to give any significance to the sighting.

MEMOS FOR THE RECORD

At 0130, 1 August 1966 Lt Marley was notified by SSgt Jones, of Tdi, that the Duty Officer had information on an important sighting in Pennsylvania that took place in a public park. The police wanted to know if the type of thing the Duty Officer and others felt that the object appeared as a light and stayed there for 45 minutes, so there would be no need for roping off the area. Duty Officer was Captain.

At 0745, 1 August, Lt Marley received a telephone call from Major Youngstown Airport, 513-360, that was a call to SSgt autovan. Youngstown had been advised by Captain O'Brian. Major Wall didn't know anything about the sighting in Pennsylvania. They are manned by civilian guards over the weekends only; it was those guards that gave the number of Wright-Patterson reports to the Police in Pennsylvania. Lt Marley said he would contact Youngstown.

Talked to Sgt Heckenshaw with the State Police, Pennsylvania, and the State Police said that the lighting had been brought to their attention and people were stuck in the sand and they saw this bright shiny object. Later they saw it land and then later they saw a black monster in the area. Sgt Heckenshaw at this point mentioned that it was possible that it was some kind of hoax or prank that took over at this time.

Lt Marley spoke with Chief of Park Police Dan Descania, 814 833-6132, who said that statements from the people. Descania had talked with Captain O'Brian and said not to rope the area off. A search of the area commenced at 9 am.

At 1930, 1 August 1966 Lt Marley was called by Major Hall from the sighting. A state police officer, Mr. was contacted with Mr. Major Hall said that the first observer saw something free falling downward to the sand. There were first white lights noted; however, after the object supposedly hit the white lights disappeared and red lights became visible. They watched this for about 10 minutes. When the park police came up the object disappeared and were never seen again. The police did not see anything Major Hall feels there could be something down the beach and Miss noted a type of black monster around the car a began to blow the horn causing the other two witnesses to return to the car. Major Hall has had some All this could be done at the scene. He that a personal interview should be performed with the witnesses.

At 0745, 2 August 1966, Lt Marley spoke with Captain Meier, Niagara AD 231-3860, ext. 351. Two witnesses returned to Jamestown, New York, subsequently and a personal investigation with them. Requested Captain file this. He has Duty Officer today and tomorrow, but said he probably go relieved of this duty or someone else would go today. He will call with findings followed by a written report. He will look into the fact that is year old case hysterical."

The text reads:

Spoke with Major Hale, 3 August 1966, 0745 hours. Airplane is going off in approximately ¾ hour from Youngstown, arriving in Dayton, approximately 1¼ hours later. 2335* is the plane number. Wanted us to call base to have them notified that they were departing off some information packages and will be right off again. Recommended bringing a station wagon to pick up the cast and soil samples.

Two guys from AFFK descended the plane over the beach Monday night. They took a picture, about five seconds, as some light, with a movie camera. They are sending this film into us. With all the background information on it.

Sand samples in tubes are marked one, Y and other E. This stands for areas where the sighting took place. One is from West section other East section.  

Conversation with Capt Keller, 3 August 1966, 1445 hours. He has rewritten statement from all witnesses. There is no description on all of these. The length, size etc. There doesn't seem to be any concrete. If you talk to them you see that they definitely have seen something. He disarms of "so called space craft which they described as real. Witnesses described it as a five sided figure, with lights around it, in the middle. Observed from 300-400 yards away. He had talked to the graphic who took the pictures of the landing site. Everything is going to build onto everything. 32 year old calm. She didn't see it land, only saw something in the sky like a satellite. Thought it was a satellite. Noise was similar to a jet motor. Girls saw nothing except a glow through the woods. Glow of course.

PTD Duty Officer called three different times to inform me that Captain called and wanted a breakdown of the UFO sighting in Erie, Pa. I asked OD to call Captain Meier back and to tell him our office would call him at 0730 or 0800 hours in the morning on 3 August 1966. 

Again O.D. called back and stated Capt Meier called him and wanted to know if he should go to Erie, Pa. that he could only get a statement from the observers and she didn't make too much sense. The other girl was to Erie to present interview and I told the OD to call him back at the girls house tomorrow, 3 August 1966.

Again: O.D. called and said Capt Meier called him again and said if he went at the time stated we were going to call the other observers home for the statement required by us. O.D. requested that either Lt Marley or myself give Capt Meier a call.

2115(L) I called Capt Meier and gave him a brief summary of the sight. He stated that the girl he spoke to did not make much sense, all she was saying that it sounded like a jet engine going on and off right away. Told Capt Meier as soon as he got the other observers statements to call collect and he said he would give us a rundown of what the girl told him.

2145(L) Received another call from the O.D. he was here and he stated that Juan called and wanted to know about the M/Sgt Hall from Project Blue Book and I informed the O.D. if they want me to call them back to tell them to call our office from 0715 - 1600. The O.D. wanted to know if it would be okay is he said Project Blue Book. And I said that's Okay.

in the large sand sample which was taken around the indentation. was sprayed into the indentations prior to casting the mold. A sample of the five samples around the area definitely had the presence of an additional chemical test will be performed of these five samples.

3 August 1966, contacted Mr. Wagner about the analysis of indentation sand off Lake Erie, Pa. left getting of indentation at his office. (Lt. Baker) would furnish him with measurements and additional information when Major Hall's report came in. 

4 August 1966, contacted Mr. Smithson and reported that acrylic lacquer was sprayed on indentations accounting for the presence of the acrylic urine was definitely present in several of the samples. Additional tests were in the process of being conducted.

4 August 1966, conversation with Capt Meier concerning alleged UFO Capt Meier is sending radar information, basically whether anything was reported in the area on radar.

Conversation on 4 August 1966, with the U. S. Coast Guard Base, Presque Isle, Pennsylvania: 833-6077. They had checked into there were lights over Lake Erie on the night of 1 August 1966. A fishing boat. Observed somewhere between 2130 - 2300 hours. From General Electric Plant had observed it. One plane going North, passenger planes, they too had observed the object. The Coast Guard went up in the tower and they say these weird looking lights. They took the Coast Guard boat out and found it was a fishing boat.

for the 'visitor' who has been seen over the area.
Nobody saw the object take off.  It just vanished when a police car
touched the brakes when he saw the police car coming in the rearview
The object just vanished then.  When everybody was gone, the
asked Capt Meier what the possibility of them doing

5 August 1966, conversation with Mr. Smithson of Materials Labs. Preliminary analysis of soil specimen showed having the presence of unusual material found nothing unusual in the five samples. Some traces of this material was found but this was expected.

8 August 66, conversation with Dan Descanio (Police Chief) took place concerning operation of the lighthouse in the state park. Chief Descanio said it could not have been possible for the witnesses to have seen the structure of the house because the lighthouse only throws light out over the lake. The 'UFO' isn't seen from the land.

Nothing else on the case had turned up. There had been several other reported in the area.

8 August 1966, conversation with Coast Guard Base, Presque Isle State, Pennsylvania. There was nothing in the log book to indicate the observation of an alleged UFO on the night of 31 July 1966. The tower at the base was not manned all the time. The only night that a boat was scrambled to identify an apparent UFO was the night of 1 August 1966.

They said that these lights were about 2-3 miles out, and would give the appearance of being weird.
4 August 1966, contacted Mr. Alvars V. Petersons of Flight Dynamics Lab for information on alleged indentation on the ground. Following are his comments:
1. No way object could have made stable landing without at least the appendages.
2. Sand should have been a lot more compressed for alleged landing.
3. No ground maneuver capability apparent.
4. Portions of ground around indentations appear to have been undoubtedly compressed.
5. No definite sign of vehicle departing area in the sand. No evidence of heat or sand being disturbed by aerodynamic vehicle.
6. How could object have caused car to shake when it supposedly hovered over the ground approximately 10-15 feet and then settled to the ground.
Mr. Petersons said that various persons had discussed the alleged indentations very similar to how of a boat that have been pulled up on the beach. Smaller marks looked like where anchor was placed. Also looked like the type of indentations that would have been made when a rifle was fired at the ground.
Rough weight calculations made place weight of alleged object at approximately 1500 lbs total weight. This being a static load estimate - (Mr. A.V. Petersons).

INVESTIGATION OF PRESQUE ISLE PARK UFO SIGHTING
Youngstown Municipal Airport (COGAC)
Youngstown, Ohio
LOCATION: Presque Isle State Park
Erie, Pennsylvania
OBSERVATION: On 8 Aug 66, at approximately 0155L, the Youngstown Municipal Airport Control Tower Operator observed an excellent saucer-shaped object which he investigated the phenomena and all available witnesses. The object appeared to be about 50-75 feet in diameter and was hovering at an altitude of approximately 500-1,000 feet. It had a bright blue-white light shining downward, and navigation lights were visible also. The object remained in the area for about 5-10 minutes, during which time other witnesses in the area confirmed the observation. This report is based on information and samples submitted to SAFPR on 3 August 1966.
