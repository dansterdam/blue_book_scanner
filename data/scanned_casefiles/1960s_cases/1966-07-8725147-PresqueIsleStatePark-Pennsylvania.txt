Dear Sir:

The pentagon shaped light areas on the upper right quarter of the August 5, 1966 issue of Life Magazine are images of the diaphragm of the lens used in making the picture. These are from internal reflection clear lens to a strong source of light in the field of the lens.

Other photographs showing the same phenomenon appear on pages 25 and 26 of the same issue. Your photograph of an unidentified flying object (Chicago Daily News, August 3, 1966; page 50) shows strikingly similar.

Sincerely,

Encl.

6-C                DAYTON DAILY NEWS
                    Sunday, August 4, 1968

ERIE, PA., NEWMAN SHOT THIS 'SAUCER'
        His Argument Had Five Sides

KOEHLER FOUND 5-SIDED HOLD IN STORY
        Could it be the Flying Pentagon?

Did Flying Pentagon Check
On Gemini 10 Astronauts?
By JACK JONES, Daily News Staff Writer

Did the Gemini 10 astronauts see flying saucers out in space
and before to report them?

Astronauts John W. Young and Michael Collins brought
back photographs evidencing that seems to show the same kind
of unidentified flying objects that earthbound people
spotted last week near Erie, Pa.

THE ODD THING is that the objects don't seem to be round,
the usual shape of flying saucers.

They look more like the home plate of a baseball diamond
or a flying lens-type object with five sides.

The mystery shapes showed up in the space pictures. But
no one got excited. Life magazine attempted to explain them
away by calling the geometric patches light distortions from
the spacecraft window and camera lens.

BUT THEN last week a flying saucer was reported near
Erie, Pa. With the story The Daily News ran a photo captioned
"I Looked Like This."

One sharp-eyed reader, G. F. Riegler of 848 Riverview
Terrace, spotted the similarities. He compared the astronauts'
photos to the Erie, Pa. sighting and wrote The Daily News.

EITHER THOSE flying saucers are everywhere—or else
perhaps they really are light distortions caused by the camera
lens.

To test the latter theory, staff photographer Bill Koehler
set up a camera with a spotlight aimed directly at the lens.

SURE ENOUGH, he got a picture of some mysterious, five-
sided object. In bright sunlight when you would expect no
pictures in bright light—which lets the light through a tiny,
five-sided hole.

Koehler figures the same thing could happen if the sun
shines into the lens.

Well, there goes that Martian theory.
How to get rid of those pesky little spaceships?

Children Escaped Previously

d Girl Found Unharmed

[UPI Photo]

"VISITOR FROM SPACE?"—Betty Jean Klem, 16, and three friends were sitting in their disabled car near Erie, Pa., when they saw what "appeared to be a star moving in the sky." "You could see it come down," Betty said. "It was metallic, sort of silvery. It landed between two trees." She said a formless creature then appeared from the bushes, whereupon she and the others ran. As if to support her report, this picture of an apparent unidentified flying object was snapped by a photographer who was snapping the milk can at New Castle, Pa. near the time Betty's sighted her UFO Sunday. An Air Force officer investigating Betty's story referred all queries to the Air Force Secretary.

Molds of Landing Prints Sent for U.S. Study

Flying Saucer No Hoax,
Erie Police Chief Says

Girl Hysterical
After Seeing UP
On Presque Isle

Special to the Post-Gazette
ERIE, Pa., Aug. 3—She could not have put me on as an act. That would be absolutely impossible. She was hysterical.

With these words Police Chief Dan Desanto of Presque Isle State Park discounted any possibility that a dramatic flying saucer report near Erie was a hoax.

Desanto said today he was sure "something" had been sighted by 10-year-old Betty Jean Ellen of Jamestown, N.Y., and an 13-year-old male companion, Douglas Tibetts of Greenburg, N.Y.

Others See It
They were among a carful of people who reportedly saw a "metallic, sort of silvery" object land between two trees on Presque Isle Peninsula Sunday.

A rash of other reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) followed the incident.

Two police officers in suburbs east of Erie reported seeking a bright light moving, and both said the officers said the object...

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Another unqualified bright object was reported moving across the sky at 9:20 a.m. by eight persons on a beach near Erie. One of the witnesses—Dennis Buckel of an Erie radio station—said they watched it for about 10 minutes during which period it changed direction several times.

Saw Another Day Before
Buckel said they saw an elongated object at about the same time and place the day before.

Spokesman at Buhl Place Planetarium in Pittsburgh were unable to account for the sightings. Arthur Draper, Buhl's program director, ruled out the possibility of meteors—notable sightings never last as long as 10 minutes—artificial satellites—sightings don't change direction. Weather balloons were also ruled out.

Meanwhile, there were these developments in the investigation of the original sighting by Miss Kline:

• Maj. William S. Hall, an Air Force investigator, created plaster molds made of imprints in the sand, allegedly produced by the legs of the UFO. The molds were sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton.

• An astronomy professor at James-town Community College, Dr. Marshall Marrs, said he will interview Miss Kline. He is a member of the National Investigators Committee for Aerial Phenomena (NICAP).

• Two other NICAP members were investigating the report.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Another WILL PARSONS, Jerry Trembley, said he saw the same object two hours later and another strange cluster of flashing lights.

ON SUNDAY, Betty Jean Kline, 16, of Jamestown, N.Y., and Jacque Hakes, 16, of Greenland, N.Y. said they saw a peculiar silvery object that near their car on beach No. 6 on Presque Isle State Park, a curving peninsula jutting into Lake Erie.

Police said they found two triangular impressions in the sand, about six inches deep.

The rangers' report, received five members of National Investigations Committee on aerial Phenomena and an official from the headquarters of Presque Isle Air Force Base.

POLICE CLOSED UP the beach area.

The WEST newsman came up with motion pictures of objects in the sky.

Said Trembley of the objects he saw:

"As we walked toward the spot where the original sighting took place we again noticed the movement of the same object or the same type of object in the sky, but this time it was more south than the original sighting."

He said a second object "had only red and green and white lights, but did not act like an ordinary plane. It came first towards us and then seemed to head away and climb higher in the sky."

STATEMENT

INTERVIEWING OFFICER: Captain Harry Meier
Chief, Operations and Training
Niagara Falls International Airport
Niagara Falls, New York

The first interview was conducted on 2 August 1966, in the home of Anita Haifley. She was very calm and had more interest in her children than the interview. Information given on her written statement varied from the information received from the interview. She was very easily lead, agreeing with any statements, not being able to think of what to say.

The interview of Betty Klem, Gerold and Douglas was conducted in the home of Betty on the 3rd of August. Both Gerold and Douglas stated they were both very interested in UFO's. Gerold stated he had seen one (UFO) last year. Douglas stated he had seen them before and so had his father, stating, someone has to find out what "they" want, either they are good, or bad. "The longer Douglas talked, the more distant or "wayout" his stories were. Douglas stated that he thought the object was going to pick up the monster the girl saw. Also, the monster was sighted in Jamestown, the night of the 1st and 2nd and that the monster was looking for Betty because she saw it. There was no mention of a full moon, only a dark, clear sky - yet no one could identify anything. Why would they go to a beach a hundred miles away when there are many beach areas on the Lake in Jamestown, arriving at the picnic area at 8:00 PM and were ready to leave at 8:20 as stated in Betty's statement. All statements varied and no one would say or write just what it was they saw.

Douglas and Betty were the only ones interviewed by the press yet Anita also was present at the sighting. She had no idea that Douglas and Betty went back to Erie for the interview or that I had set up an interview on the 3rd of August. Also, newsmen arrived and wanted to take pictures of Betty and Douglas; Sister-in-law to Betty requested no pictures since Mom and Dad were on vacation. However, Douglas was all for the pictures when I departed.

My personal opinion is that Betty, Douglas and Gerold set up a hoax, getting Anita involved as a backup. Every time the police arrived, the object disappeared. Douglas seems unreliable, likes to tell stories. Anita is very gullible. Betty seemed reliable, Gerold's statement varied from Douglas's statement. Gerold was not accounted for until everything was over. Douglas said the object was on the right side of the car, Betty said it was in front. Betty said a stem came from the center of the object before landing. It looked like the stem of a big mushroom. Douglas drew the object having no center.

I hope you can make sense out of my own thoughts, but the more I think about the type of people that are involved the more disbelief there is.

If any more information is required, please call.

STATEMENT

INTERVIEWING NCO: Earl W. Schroeder, SSgt, USAF
Niagara Falls International Airport
Niagara Falls, New York 14306

After carefully analyzing the facts as told to us by the people involved in this sighting and from my personal observation of the people concerned and the environment they live in, I have come to the conclusion that this incident could very well be a hoax concocted by three of the principals involved and in my opinion, was led to believe she saw the things stated in her statement by knowledge of part of it if it is found to be a hoax.

Being a native of this area and having spent a good share of my life hunting and fishing this area, I believe that the so called "monster" (if there was such) could very well have been a large black bear; as black bears are not too uncommon in this area.

Some of the facts that bring me to this conclusion are as follows:

1. All four principals stated it was a clear dark night - no clouds in the sky. There was no mention of the moon which on 31 July was full and rose at 1930 hours in this area.

2. During the week of 26 July the local TV stations showed a program called "Lost in Space". In this program there were two monsters fitting their description controlled by a human being.

3. [Partially obscured text]

4. When first observed, as she states "monster", she exclaimed "close your eyes, it is coming".

5. [Partially obscured text] stated that he knew the beach and beach area and that they went there for a picnic. However, the picnic lasted only twenty minutes and the distance between Jamestown and the beach is approximately 80 miles.

6. The only persons whose statements agree on exact times of the sighting and disappearance of the vehicle is a boy and girl-friend.

We arrived at the Erie peninsula at about 8:00 clock, we sat the table and started to grill its hot dogs and eat the other food. At about 8:30 I would change into our bathing suits. Well we and myself got into the car and started to back and became unable to move the car either way, so I went for some helps with other pictures so the girls and I climbed into the car to sit and write. At about 10:30 clock we noticed a car coming up behind us which was to police officers. They showed I was stuck, I told them I had checked that for help, they said they would check that in about 15 minutes. 10:15 I noticed this object starting to fall out of the sky. I didn't think so much of it then as it was a meteorite, but now this feeling object came. There I noticed a red light flushed of and started the ground as in though I became thing at about 10:35 the police effecting coming up from the car, I hit my brakes in my brake lights.

On Sunday July 31, 1966

my two daughters, and I went to the peninsula for a picnic. About 1:00 pm we got to beach 6. when we got ready to leave we discovered that we were stuck in the sand. At 9:30 Jerry left to get help. At got into the car to put the girls to sleep. The police came at 9:45 to 10:00 and told us to stay in the car and they would be back in 5 min. I was after they left pointed out this object in the sky. I was in the back seat and couldn't see it when I heard toward & saw this silvery object. I thought it was just a satellite going back down. Then we heard this sound similar to jet noise shutting down. I was watching out the back window for Jerry and did not see it land. I heard a gap at the same time & felt the car vibrate. I turned around and said that it had landed. I looked towards the woods and saw this glow. I then saw this light beam coming out from where they said it had landed. I watched the light for a couple minutes and then started looking for Jerry again. I heard some sounds like something in the woods, when the police came back the beam of light disappeared. I got out of the car and told the police what was happening. The two policemen and Jerry went towards where this object had landed. I thought that I inside car and looked out the back window again. I started to turn around and say something to settle just then she said to close my eyes. I's coming. I looked passed her towards the woods.

I saw this black thing coming out of the woods at us. I was about 7 to 8 feet tall. Betty started slowing it down. The horn was ringing and I took care of it by stopped blowing the horn and started yelling. I told her to continue slowing the horn until the men came back. This creature came to about 6 or 7 yds of the car when last looked at it I saw the flashlights and the men and told Betty. I kept trying

Cont, UFO Report Per AFR 200-2

Statements from the police lead to the following chain of events: At 8:15 PM ENST, group arrived. At 9:30PM, probably as beach became deserted, Gerald Labelle left to get help. Additional witness reports seeing the car at 9:40pm with light on inside and people around picnic table. 10PM, police noted car, stopped to offer help. Informed at help had been sent for, they said they would return in about 45 minutes and see if all was well. At that time all persons were sitting in car, with food still on table about 20' away, around some bushes, 10:25 to 10:30 sighting took place. 10:35 police returned.

Were told by Tibbetts "Something weird is going on up there". Tibbetts and police departed car and walked nearly 300 yards up beach when Miss Kleen heard rustling in bushes, looked up to see "dull black shape, bigger than a man, big head and shoulders, arm like appendages, no hands, no face visible, as though it had a back turned." It was in front of the car, and when Miss Kleen blew the horn it "lumbered into the bushes". The lights were not turned on. Tibbetts and police ran back to cars. All persons got into police car and returned to Admin Bldg to calm down women and alert police chief. Policemen and Tibbetts returned to stalled car, searched area around picnic table with no results. More food missing from table and cake gouged.

At 0630AM, just after full daylight, 2 other patrolmen searched the beach and found marks they considered unusual. They had no exact knowledge of the area designated by Tibbetts as landing place. These marks did coincide with that area, according to patrolmen who accompanied him. (See exhibits for diagram and pictures). I believe the witnesses were at least nervous at being stuck in the sand in an unlighted area. This is supported by the fact they had abandoned their picnic on the table and were in the car. Police report comments of scratching sound heard prior to sighting. Whatever was seen or purported to be seen of the UFO must have heightened this feeling. Tibbetts warned women to keep windows up and doors locked while he and the patrolmen walked up the beach. He further directed Miss Kleen to flash the lights if she needed them while they were gone. When she saw the "shape", she blew the horn. Instead, and told Mrs (?) Halfely "not to look."

- I have no reasonable explanation of the UFO, but the scratching sounds, loud missing and "arm like appendages", with no hands of the shape, leads me to a possible explanation of the shape as a raccoon or the shadow of a raccoon being projected from the picnic table. The park has many of them that regularly visit picnic areas.

I apologize, but the text on this page is almost entirely illegible. There appears to be a small fragment of text or shape in the top left corner of the page, but it is too blurry and indistinct to read with any certainty. The document seems to be a scanned black and white page with varying shades of gray, but no clear text is visible.

The page appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram with a compass-like orientation marker (with S and N visible), some lines, and what seems to be a rough sketch of an object or shape on the right side of the page. The image is in black and white and appears to be a scanned document with some image degradation around the edges.

Recommendations:

1. Instructions be issued to investigating Air Force personnel to remain completely objective in the reporting and recording of observed data. The distortion of the true orientation of the two larger footprints would have been very misleading had the photographs not been available to show them to be located in other than symmetrical manner.

2. It is suggested that an appointed member of the civil engineering personnel of each Air Force Base be given a very brief course in obtaining soil samples and taking soil strength data readings. Capt. Skillen, AFTI/CEC, has suggested that this course could be given to such personnel during their regularly scheduled periods of instruction at the Air Force Institute of Technology at WPAFB. In this manner, a more accurate estimated weight and expressions can be made in the investigation of future reported sightings.

For instance, it is highly desirable that cone penetrometer (or similar tests) be performed at a number of stations in the immediate vicinity of the depression as well as within the depression itself. In this manner, the strength of the undisturbed soil would be established as well as the degree of compression of the soil under the footprint area.

3. It is mandatory that a more accurate layout of the footprint locations and orientation be made. Pieces of string tied between pegs can serve as valuable reference lines. At the minimum, a base line should be drawn by scribing a straight line in a conventional location on the soil. All points would then be referenced from this line so that an accurate diagram can be reconstructed of the site by participating investigators. Photographs of the site should include this base line (or lines) as a reference. In this particular case, no record was made of the angular relationship of the two larger triangular footprints, which is a decided handicap in the analysis of the evidence.

ATTN OF: PDFM/R. J. Parker/55027                                                                   8 August 1966

SUBJECT: Evaluation of Depressions Found in Beach Sand in Presque Isle
         State Park Near Erie, Pennsylvania

TO:     Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., FTDTR

The Landing Gear Group of the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory was asked to evaluate the subject depressions found in the vicinity of a UFO sighting that occurred on July 30, 1966. According to the investigators, the location of the depressions did not correspond to the area where the witness reported that the UFO alighted. However, the unusual shape and orientation of the depressions prompted further investigation following their discovery. The following are the conclusions and recommendations of PDFM:

Conclusions:

1. According to the investigating USAF Officer, the sand was definitely compressed under load and not excavated as might have been done by a child playing on the beach.

2. Assuming that the depressions were made by an applied load and based on inspection of the soil sample and the plaster-of-paris casting provided, the estimated weight that caused the two larger depressions was 750-1000 lbs. Since no information was given regarding the size and depth of the smaller (third) depression, no estimate regarding the weight that may have rested on it can be given.

3. According to Mr. Max Groff, BWRG, of Base Civil Engineering, the outrigger stabilizing pads of certain large construction equipment could leave an inverted three-sided pyramid footprint similar to the ones found on Presque Isle. However, no vehicle tracks were observed in the vicinity of the footprint, which effectively eliminates this potential explanation.

4. The layout of the three footprints showed no semblance of symmetry. If the third, smaller footprint is discounted, lines extended through the apex and bisecting each of the two larger triangular footprints do not converge in a symmetrical manner. This information, obtained from such a photograph which shows both larger footprints, is contrary to the orientation shown on the sketch made by the USAF investigating officer.

5. Based on the number of depressions and their orientation, it is not likely that they served as ground-stabilizing contact elements for any kind of platform or vehicle. A minimum of three points is necessary to provide stable support of any object and some form of symmetry in their location is basically logical.

Of the three adult witnesses, I was able to talk to only the male, and to obtain statements from the two police officers who arrived on the scene. Statements from news editor who was called in by the chief of police and additional personnel were taken. The general impression is that the witnesses were fairly level-headed, but obviously frightened. Miss Klem was described as being very nearly in a state of shock but rapidly regained control of herself when taken to the Park Admin Office. Listening to conversation of those present at the initial interview, there appear to be discrepancies in description between Mr Tibbetts and Miss Klem.

ANALYSIS TEST REPORT
ANALYTICAL BRANCH

SUBJECT: Analysis of Sand from Erie, Pennsylvania Related to UFO
TEST NR: 6-1018/1024                                   TASK NR: 601024
SUBMITTED BY: Lt. William F. Marley, Jr., AETR, 70216   DATE RECEIVED: 4 Aug 66
PURPOSE: Analyze sandy material that is bound together to determine the identity of the binder and the sandy material in the plastic vials to determine the identity of any organic material present.

FACTUAL DATA:
Five samples of sand in plastic vials and about 10 pounds of sand were submitted for analysis. Three of the vials were labeled "J" and two vials were labeled "M".

The ten pounds of sand was submitted in a large pasteboard box.

The vials were opened and all of them had a strong unmistakable odor of urine.

A test for the urea in urine was performed by heating a portion of the wet sand from each vial in a small amount of distilled water and sodium hydroxide. A red litmus paper was held over the top of the container in which the sand, water, and sodium hydroxide were heated and in every case the litmus turned blue indicating that ammonia had been formed. This was a positive test that urea was present in the sand.

Other portions of the wet sand in the vials were dried under a heat lamp and extracted with chloroform. The chloroform was evaporated but no residue was found.

The sand in the box contained several pieces of sand bonded together in the form of thin flat sheets. One of the pieces of bonded sand was placed in a beaker of water but no observable change took place. Another piece of bonded sand was placed in a beaker of chloroform and the bonding substance dissolved. The soluble portion of the bonded sand was decanted and the chloroform was evaporated. An infrared spectrum of the soluble substance was recorded and identified as an acrylic resin. At a later time this identification was made and reported verbally to Lt. Marley of AETR, he informed me that he had just received information that the sand had been sprayed with an acrylic resin prior to making plaster of paris casts of the indentations. (Next page.)

ANALYSIS TEST REPORT

FACTUAL DATA
Obviously, the acrylic resin that was identified came from the investigator who made plaster of Paris casts of the indentations.

This is a good opportunity to emphasize the importance of being a representative and an uncontaminated sample if the sample is to be subjected to a chemical analysis.

A portion of the sand in the box which appeared to be uncontaminated by the acrylic resin was extracted with chloroform. The chloroform was evaporated and a small residue remained which was identified by infrared spectroscopy as an ester.

It is not unusual to find esters in the soil.

CONCLUSIONS
The five samples submitted in the plastic vials contained urine.

The sand submitted in the box contained a very small amount of ester material, however, this was not considered to be unusual. The acrylic resin originated from one of the investigators when he sprayed the indentations with the resin prior to making plaster of Paris casts.

Cont. UFO Report Per AFR 200-2

The witness appeared creditable. He did state affirmative answer to one questioner who asked if he was a policeman. He was wearing a borrowed police jacket at the time - early morning. This could have been caused by lack of desire to be questioned by curiosity seekers.

Park police placed a vehicle at the observers spot and cruised the area roads with another vehicle with various light combinations to try to duplicate light conditions, but could not.

Newsreel photographers stationed all night on the beach the following night saw a light and photographed it. Film is being forwarded in accordance with AFR 200-2.

L. Physical Evidence
1. Physical evidence is questionable. Two triangular marks found in the sand (see attach #1) were photographed and a plaster of paris cast made by Penna State Police. There is no evidence to actually relate these marks to the sighting. These marks were obviously made by an angular flat, slightly concave object pointed slightly down, and pushed into the sand, as evidenced by firmly packed bottom surface, sand pushed up in crater-like ridge around the edges, and penetration of this angular surface about 4 - 5" below surface of sand, maximum. Cast was made with top even with average surface of sand, not as deep as pushed up ridges. A smaller mark, similar but not identical with two larger marks, as seen in photo, it has no obvious relation with other two holes. The most striking feature of these marks is their similarity, being nearly identical, except for direction.

Some damp spots in the sand near by, which did not become noticeably drier during the day were sampled from various locations within the damp area, and samples are included, along with sketch of area.

Full cast of Easterly hole is included, and partial cast of West hole, along with sand from general area.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

Both investigators (Major Hall - Captain Meier) reported discrepancies in the information available to them. The following is a listing of puzzling factors:

1. Who actually saw "black shape"?
2. Description of object quite varied.
3. Who actually walked down beach?
4. The sounds heard varied.
5. Vibrations of car as alleged UFO settled to ground.
6. How did object disappear.
7. Why were [redacted] and [redacted] getting ready to go swimming when Miss [redacted] reports they were ready to leave for home at about 8:30.
8. Why were persons parking on that part of beach at this time of night.

Observers were watching the sky from inside the stranded automobile when they noticed a bright star. Arcturus was on an azimuth of 275° at a 30° elevation at 1030 EDT, possibly accounting for this observance. Looking back several seconds later an object was observed "free falling" toward the ground.

The girls saw nothing but a light in the sky and a glow of light in the woods prior to observing the "black shape". One observer, however, provided a vivid description of the alleged UFO. Only male observer allegedly saw object land.

There was food missing from the picnic table which leads to the belief that some animal was responsible for the black shape portion of the total sighting.

There are numerous bears and raccoons in the area.


- page 89 -

CONCLUSIONS

1. No evidence exists to relate the damp areas and the indentations found on the beach to the sighting. Considering the indentations, the following comments are presented:

a. No object could have made a stable landing without at least a third appendage.

b. Sand should have been a lot more compressed for alleged landing.

c. No ground maneuver capability apparent.

d. Portions of ground indentations appear to have been uncovered - not totally compressed, as should have been.

e. No definite sign of vehicle departing area in the sand. No evidence of heat blast or sand being disturbed by aerodynamic vehicle.

f. Rough weight calculations place weight of alleged object at approximately 1500 lbs. total weight. This being a static load estimate calculated anticipating a two-legged object.

g. Acrylic resin was present in the large sample taken around the indentation. This was attributed to the acrylic lacquer which was sprayed on the indentations prior to casting the mold.

h. Urine was distinctly present in the soil samples.

2. Both Major Hall and Mr. Parmenter (Erie County Civil Defense) checked for existence of radioactivity. In both cases negative results were obtained.


- page 90 -

COMMENTS FOR RELEASE TO SAFOI

1. No correlation can be found to exist between the three facets of the case under consideration: light - indentations, indentations - monster, monster - light.

2. No evidence exists to relate the damp sandy areas and the indentations found on the beach to the visual sightings. Considering the three indentations, no evidence is present to indicate a landing of any type occurred (Flights Dynamics Lab, W-PAFB). A chemical analysis of the soil samples was completed. There was nothing unusual in the samples except urine (AF Materials Lab W-P AFB).

3. There is no evidence to substantiate the presence of a black monster. No unusual markings were found to indicate such a "thing" was observed. The missing food and scratching sounds are indicative of some type of animal in the area.

4. As yet, there is no explanation of the lights that were observed. An object was observed "free-falling" for approximately 3 - 5 seconds. Concluding a possible meteor as the explanation, the Smithsonian Institute was contacted; however, they had no information of any meteors being observed at this time and place. Contact was made with the Park Police and nearby U.S. Coast Guard Base for any unusual lights over the area. Negative results were received in both cases.

5. With the existing data no conclusive explanation can be made concerning the lights. It is assumed that no correlation existed between the lights, the indentations, and the "alleged black monster".

Relayed above information to SAFOI on 8 August 66 at 1525.


- page 91 -

Worthy of note is the fact that as object settled to the ground the car vibrated. An object slowly descending onto a sandy area isn't likely to cause the vibration of a car approximately 300 - 400 yards in the distance, especially since the depth of the indentations were only about 4 - 5 inches in the loose sand.

Various discrepancies are noted throughout the available information. These discrepancies are prevalent in the description of the alleged UFO and in the actual sequence of events as they occurred. Considering these discrepancies, it is difficult to give any credence to the sighting. The validity of the sighting is definitely questionable.

MEMOS FOR THE RECORD

At 0130, 1 August 1966 Lt Marley was notified by SSgt Jones, of TDETR, that the Duty Officer had information on an important sighting in Pennsylvania that took place in a public park. The police wanted to know if they should rope off the area. Lt Marley called the Duty Officer and after finding out that the object appeared as a light and stayed there for 45 minutes that there would be no need for roping off the area. Duty Officer was Captain O'Brian.

At 0745, 1 August, Lt Marley received a telephone call from Major Hall, Youngstown Airport, 231-3600, ext. 258 autovan. Youngstown had been called by Captain O'Brian. Major Hall didn't know anything about the sightings over in Pennsylvania. They are manned by civilian guards over the weekends and evidently it was these guards that gave the number of Wright-Patterson to the Police in Pennsylvania. Lt Marley said he would contact Youngstown if they are to go out and investigate.

Talked to Sgt Heckencheck with the State Police, Pennsylvania 814 899-3117 - State Police said that the sighting had been brought to their attention. These people were stuck in the sand and they saw this bright shiny object that sparked. Later they saw it land and then later saw a black monster in the bushes. Sgt Heckenchek at this point mentioned that it was possible imagination which took over at this time.

Lt Marley spoke with Chief of Park Police Dan Dascani, 814 833-6124. We got statements from the people. Dascanio had talked with Captain O'Brian and he said not to rope the area off. A search of the area commenced at daylight and

all had returned with the exception of two officers. The people said there were marks out there, but they hadn't seen anything yet. Basically the same report is in the newspaper. He will send us his report along with the newspaper clippings. Yes these people had also observed a black monster. He would send us his reports.

Conversation 0930, 1 August 1966 with Major Hall, Youngstown Airport.
He will leave at noon today to check out the sighting, will take a camera, camper, geiger counter etc., will try to go as near as possible to AFR 200-2.

Since the witnesses have returned to New York, Major Hall will have Niagra AFS contact the witnesses and give Major Hall information received from witnesses. Explained to Major Hall that there had been widespread publicity already on this. Major Hall said he would get background readings from the geiger counter and then readings in the immediate area. Will call us collect to inform us how things are going.

Conversation at 1500 hours, 1 August 1966 with Major Hall, on the scene this afternoon, presently at the Police Department at Erie, Pa. Object left three "V" shaped marks in the ground, 45° angle, indentations 4 inches deep, two identical, indentations 16 feet apart, 10 - 12 inches long.

Getting statement from Tibbetts - other two observers back in Jamestown, New York. Cast being made and Major Hall had taken pictures. Had gotten five soil samples. There is a plane coming over to Wright-Patterson AFB 2 August 1966 and he will get this stuff on the plane. The Civil Defense had a negative reading as far as radioactivity goes. Major Hall had negative reading

on radioactivity. He will get the Civil Defense to give a statement to this effect. is apparently level headed. Measurements were made by tape measure.

At 1930, 1 August 1966 Lt Marley was called by Major Hall from scene of sighting. After conversation with Mr. Major Hall said that said observer saw something free falling downward to the sand. There were at first white lights noted; however, after the object supposedly hit the ground the white lights disappeared and red lights became visible. Mr. watched this for about 10 minutes. When the park police came up the lights disappeared and were never seen again. The police did not see anything.

and Miss. were walking down the beach and Miss. stayed in the car. Miss. noted a type of black monster around the car and she began to blow the horn causing the other two witnesses to return to the car.

Major Hall felt he had done all that could be done at the scene. He thought that a personal interview should be performed with the witnesses.

At 0745, 2 August 1966, Lt Marley spoke with Captain Meier, Niagra AFS autovan 231-3660, ext. 351. Two witnesses returned to Jamestown, New York, need statements and a personal investigation with tem. Requested Captain Meier do this. He has Duty Officer today and tomorrow, but said he probably could get relieved of this duty or someone else would go today. He will call in his findings followed by a written report. He will look into the fact that the 15 year old gets hysterical.

Conversations at the home of SSgt Harold T. Jones on 2 August 1966, approximately 1915.

Spoke with Major Hall, 3 August 1966, 0745 hours. Airplane is going to take off in approximately 1/2 hour from Youngstown, arriving in Dayton, approximately 1 1/2 hours later. 2335k is the plane number. Wanted us to call Base Ops and have them notified that they were just dropping off some information and packages and will be right off again. Recommended bringing a station wagon to pick up the cast and soil samples.

Two guys from WJET decided to park over on the beach Monday night. They saw some light, with a movie camera they took a picture, about five seconds. WJET is sending this film into us. With all the background information on the film, camera, etc.

Sand samples in tubes are marked one, W and other E. This stands for the areas where the sighting took place. One is from West section other from East section.

Conversation with Capt Meier, 3 August 1966, 1145 hours. He has received written statements from all witnesses. There is no description on any of these. The length, size etc. There doesn't seem to be any concrete. When you talk to them you see that they definitely have seen something. He has a diagram of so called space craft which they described as real wierd.

described it as a five sided figure, with lights around it, empty in the middle. Observed from 300-400 yards away. He had talked to the photographer who took the pictures of the landing site. Everything is sort of word of mouth.

will build onto everything. 22 year old girl very calm. She didn't see it land, only saw something in the sky like a satellite. Thought it was a satellite. Noise was similar to a jet motor. Felt the car vibrate. Girls saw nothing except a glow through the woods. Glow of light.

FTD Duty Officer called three different times to inform me that Captain Meier called and wanted a breakdown of the UFO sightings in Erie, Pa. I asked the OD to call Captain Meier back and to tell him our office would call him at 0730 or 0800 hours in the morning on 3 August 1966.

Again: O.D. called back and said Capt Meier called him and wanted to know if he should go to Erie, Pa. that he could only get a statement from one of the observers and she didn't make too much sense. The other girl went back to Erie for a press interview and I told the OD to call him back and tell him to go to the girls house tomorrow, 3 August 1966.

Again: O.D. called and said Capt Meier called again and said if we called him at the time stated we were going to call that it would be too late that he would be enroute to the other observers home for the statement requested by us. O.D. requested that either Lt Marley or myself give Capt Meier a call and brief him on the sighting tonight.

2115(L) I called Capt Meier and gave him a brief summary of the sighting and he stated that the girl he spoke to did not make much sense, all she kept saying that it sounded like a jet engine going on and off right overhead.

Told Capt Meier as soon as he got the other observers statement to give us a call collect and he said he would give us a rundown of what the girl said.

2145(L) Received another call from the O.D. at home and he stated that "UPT" just called and wanted to know about the Maj Hall from Project Blue Book that was investigating the sighting in Erie. I informed the O.D. if they called back to tell them to call our office from 0715 - 1600. The O.D. wanted to know if it would be okay if he said Project Blue Book, and I said that was Okay.

in the large sand sample which was taken around the indentation. This binder was sprayed into the indentations prior to casting the mold. A small test of the five samples around the area definitely had the presence of urine. An additional chemical test will be performed of these five samples.

3 August 1966, contacted Mr. Wagner about the analysis of indentations in the sand off Lake Erie, Pa. Left casting of indentation at his office. Told him I (It Marley) would furnish him with measurements and additional information when Major Hall's report came in.

4 August 1966, contacted Mr. Smithson and reported that acrylic lacquer was sprayed on indentations accounting for the presence of the acrylic resin. Urine was definitely present in several of the samples. Additional testing were in the process of being conducted.

4 August 1966, conversation with Capt Meier concerning alleged UFO sighting. Capt Meier is sending radar information, basically whether anything unusual was reported in the area on radar.

Conversation on 4 August 1966, with the U. S. Coast Guard Base, Presque Isle State Park, Erie, Pennsylvania, 833-7697. They had checked into the fact that there were lights over Lake Erie on the night of 1 August 1966. All it was, was a fishing boat. Observed somewhere between 2130 - 2200 hours. Somebody from General Electric Plant had observed it. One plane going North and one was going South, passenger planes, they too had observed the objects. The Coast Guard went up in the tower and they saw these weird looking lights on the lake. They took the Coast Guard boat out and found it was a fishing boat.

Here is the text from the document:

drew a picture of it. Did not observe any legs under it. seems reliable and said that it looked like a mushroom from underneath object.

comes from a clean type of home. There is nothing you can put your finger on. The news reporter described the indentations to be 6 - 8 inches deep in parts, fluffy sand around it, as if nothing solid was there.

said something about there being web foot with 9 toes. Both of the girls and saw 7 - 8 foot monster came out of woods, blew the horn and it just went back. A tree nearby had claw marks on it, with bark torn off. Capt Meier had a Sgt with him who was a hunter and said that it could easily be bear marks, as there are bear in the area. Conflicting information during the whole case.

was in the car. Personally he cannot believe. has seen these things before. had gone to get help, hitched a ride into Erie and then stayed there all night, not sending help until the next morning.

saw one of these things last year. No shape, no nothing, has gone back to the area and hopes to see them. thinks the spacecraft is looking for the beast who has been seen over the area.

Nobody saw the object take off. It just vanished when a police car came.

touched the brakes when he saw the police car coming in the rear view mirror. The object just vanished then. When everybody was gone they say the monster. Asked Capt Meier what the possibility of the doing the scaring. He felt that this was quite possible, since they could not account for his presence, other than he supposedly went after aid for the car.

3 August 1966, contacted Mr. Lee Smithson of AF Materials Labs. 55119 (MAYA).

Mr. Smithson made initial investigation and determined an acrylic resin present


- page 101 -

5 August 1966, conversation with Mr. Smithson of Materials Labs. Confirmed preliminary analysis of soil specimen as having the presence of urine. Mr. Smithson found nothing unusual in the five samples. Some traces of organic material was found but this was expected.

8 August 66, conversation with Dan Dascanio (Police Chief) took place concerning operation of the lighthouse in the state park. Chief Dascanio said that it would not have been possible for the witnesses to have seen the lighthouse because the lighthouse only throws light out over the lake. The light isn't seen from the land.

Nothing else on the case had turned up. There had been several other cases reported in the area.

8 August 1966, conversation with Coast Guard Base, Presque Isle State Park, Pennsylvania. There was nothing in the log book to indicate the observance of an alleged UFO on the night of 31 July 1966. The tower at the base is not manned all the time. The only night that a boat was scrambled to identify an apparent UFO was the night of 1 August 1966.

Relayed above information to SAFOI at 1525, 8 August 1966.

They said that these lights were about 2-3 miles out, and would give the appearance of being weird.

4 August 1966, contacted Mr. Aivars V. Petersons of Flight Dynamics Lab (PDFM) for information on alleged indentations in ground. Following are his comments:

1. No way object could have made stable landing without at least third appendage.

2. Sand should have been a lot more compressed for alleged landing.

3. No ground maneuver capability apparent.

4. Portions of ground around indentations appear to have been uncovered - not totally compressed as should have been.

5. No definite sign of vehicle departing area in the sand. No evidence of heat or sand being disturbed by aerodynamic vehicle.

6. How could object have caused car to shake when it supposedly hovered over the ground approximately 10-15 feet and then settled to the ground.

Mr. Petersons said that various persons had discussed the alleged landing. It was mentioned that indentations were very similar to bow of a boat that could have been pulled up on the beach. Smaller mark looked like where anchor was placed. Also looked like the type of indentations that would have been made when a rifle was fired at the ground.

Rough weight calculations made place weight of alleged object at approximately 1500 lbs total weight. This being a static load estimate - (Mr. A.V. Petersons)

4 August 1966, contacted Mr. Alex Geddes of the Smithsonian Institute on above date. He didn't have any reports of any meteors coming down over Lake Erie on 31 July 1966. Said he would call if he heard of any such reports.
