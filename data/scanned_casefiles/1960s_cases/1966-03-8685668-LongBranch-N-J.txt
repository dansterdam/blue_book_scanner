Dear Sir:

I should like to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object on March 31, 1966. These are the details:

Around 7:30 I went out to look at the stars, since I had been studying astronomy in school. I had not been out long when I noticed an elliptical object darker then the rest of the sky. It was spinning rapidly from left to right, or counter-clockwise. Across the front were four alternating blue-white lights. On the top and bottom were two lights, the top one being slightly pink.

We had learned to use a protractor as an amateur astrolabe, so I tried to measure its position. It was about 50 degrees up in the western sky.

It was slowly waning and flying away into the west. By 7:45 it was completely gone.

Enclosed is a sketch I have made of the object from memory. I would also be glad to answer any further questions.

Respectfully yours,

[Signature and identifying details redacted]
