J. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic
or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting:

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
The planet venus was visible during the period of sighting. Its movement
would conform with the movement of the object in question. The Red
and Green lights could be a result of refraction of the light through the
atmosphere. The slight up and down movement could be caused by the
autokinetic effect that is caused by staring at a light with few other
reference points available.
