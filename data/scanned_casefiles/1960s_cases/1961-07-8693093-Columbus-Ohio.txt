SUBJECT: Extract from Duty Officers' Report

TO: ATIC/2Q Maj Friend

The following, extracted from L/Tc Kimball's Report dated 1 July 1961, is quoted for your information:

0030 hours. The 376th Command Post, Lockbourne AFB called to report UFO sighting by local resident. [Redacted text]

According to the 376th DO, seeing a bright light in SW sky at elevation of approximately 45 degrees. Time of sighting unknown but presumably about 220 to 2330. Lockbourne tower reported visibility clear and 7 miles. Attempted to call Military of Venus at the position in the sky. 376th reported incident to 1st Sgt AB Meadows/AFS. TOLD later called 376th and asked then to call ATIC. Did not think it necessary to alert Aerial Phenomena Group at ATIC.

0315 hours. Received call from local resident concerning UFO. Details contained on attached Form 164. Since call Sgt Holten indicated that UFO was still in sight I called Sgt Holten so that he could look at it. Instead then he thought no further action was necessary.

0415 hours. Received call from USAF Command Post, Major Hall, who stated that a Florida resident had seen a UFO at about 0342, 2 July 61. Details given were similar to those reported by Dayton resident. I requested that a copy of the message be sent ATIC and Major Hall stated that he would do so.
