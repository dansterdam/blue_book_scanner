Dear Sirs,
For many years, I have been interested in these U.F.O. reports. I live on Vashon Island and a sighting was made 3 nights ago. I have seen, at around 9:30 p.m., 3 bright objects in formation, flying and disappearing. A person where gone, in a hurry, to call someone. I wish you could send me some reports or, perhaps, a letter, from your U.F.O. reports. I shall keep this information to myself, and to my good, and inbred dear close the U.S. have requested in keeping with the U.S. government. Thank you.
