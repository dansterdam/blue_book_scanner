Dear Sirs,

For many years, I have been interested in these U.F.O. reports. I live on Vashon Island, and I do think I have seen U.F.O.'s. It was 3 nights ago on Sept. 13, I saw, at 9:30 pm, 3 bright objects in formation, flying North. They were gone in about 20 seconds. (horizon to horizon) I wish you could send me some reports, perhaps pictures, on some U.F.O. reports. I do not plan to pass this information around but to keep it for my good, and interest. Also does the U.S. have squeezed (flying) but are keeping secret? Please send information to me if you can.

Thank you
