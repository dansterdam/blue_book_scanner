UFO Sighting on 8 Aug 66 (SAFOI Ltr, 8 Aug 66)

2856th Air Base Group (AFLC)
Attn: ROBQB/Maj. Carrington

1. Reference your letter of 8 August 1965 regarding an observation at Utica, New York. This report is incomplete and of little value to the analysis and evaluation. Your evaluation of an aircraft, or a reflection from a search light or fireworks is too vague.

2. Preparing officers are not following the guidelines established in paragraph 4 and are not complying with paragraphs 14 and 16 of AFR 200-2. In order for SAFOI to answer queries from the news media, UFO reports must be complete and comprehensive. Certain New York publications are quite active in pursuit of UFO information and frequently ask about reported UFO sightings in your area. Incomplete reports are impossible to evaluate and also cause embarrassment to SAFOI when answering queries from the news media. Please impress your UFO investigating officer with the necessity of complying with the contents of AFR 200-2.

3. Request you resubmit a report in accordance with AFR 200-2, paragraph 14 and 15 on the 8 August 1965 observation at Utica, New York.

b. Final evaluation (accuracy, reliability, timeliness, etc.)
Numerous celebrations in this area, search lights to attract attention and fireworks displays. This could have been the UFO or an aircraft in the area. There is very heavy air traffic on airways V-196, V-428 and V-145 which all converge over the city of Utica. The most probable explanation is the observer sighted a reflection from a searchlight or the lights of an aircraft flying on the airways.
