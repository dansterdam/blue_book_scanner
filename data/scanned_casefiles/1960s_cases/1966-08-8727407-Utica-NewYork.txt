UFO sighting on 3 Aug 66 (CROWN Ltr, 8 Aug 66)

1. Reference your letter of 8 August 1966 regarding an observation at Utica, New York. Your report is incomplete and of little value to the analysts and evaluators. Your evaluation of an aircraft, as a helicopter or aircraft and fireworks is too vague.

2. Preparing officers are not following the guidelines established in AFR 200-2. This letter is not complete and does not contain a detailed description of the phenomenon as observed. UFO reports must be complete and comprehensive. Certain New York UFO information requests were impossible to evaluate and also cause embarrassment to USAF UPO Information Program. Please improve the content of your reports.

3. Request you resubmit a report in accordance with AFR 200-2, paragraph 14 and 15 on the 3 August 1966 observation at Utica, New York.

7. Identifying information on observer:
a. Civilian: Name 18, Mailing Address Ave., Utica, NY, Occupation Mel's Dairy Isle, Estimate of Reliability reliable

8. Comments of reporting officer:
a. Action taken (agencies called, etc.) Griffiss AFB Control tower, Oneida Co. Airport Control Tower, FAA RAPCON and Utica Police.
Contacted: None of the agencies received any information or calls on the UFO, nor made any sightings.
b. Final evaluation (accuracy, reliability, timeliness, etc.) Numerous celebrations in this area, search lights to attract attention and commercial airplanes. This could have been the UFO or an aircraft in the area. There is very heavy air traffic on airfaring, V-1956, V-2, V-1255 and V-1-45 which all converge over the city of Utica. The most probable explanation is the observer sighted a reflection from a searchlight or the light of an aircraft on the airway.
