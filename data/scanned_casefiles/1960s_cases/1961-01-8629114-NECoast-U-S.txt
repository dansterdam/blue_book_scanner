10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One object sighted moving from N-NE. When first seen showed red and white light. Then changed to steady white light. Gave off rays like sun. 2-3 times bigger than star. Another sighted obj seemed to have tail. Another observer rptd two objts, one fm SW and one fm NE both appearing to be blue.

11. COMMENTS
Sightings were reported observed from several CG stations over a period of about 4 1/2 hrs. One obj is characteristic of rotating beacons on a/c. Some are characterized by erratic or astronomical bodies. LORAN stations at two locations experienced difficulties, cause unknown. However, these difficulties could have been caused by bad weather, which was probably present at the time. The info reported is general in nature, and the weather was not reported, precluding a valid conclusion.

12. CONCLUSIONS
