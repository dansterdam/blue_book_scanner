11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers were looking out a window when they noticed a greenish white light traveling toward the southern sky. It dimmed irregularly and changed course several times, but always continued in the same direction. Just before it disappeared over the trees, there was a bright flash like a flare where the object disappeared. A second object was seen in the same position as the first but it was traveling faster than the first. This object was lower in altitude than the first and moved in opposite direction.

Since only lights were observed it is possible that aircraft were responsible for the observation.

same vicinity as the first when it disappeared, and it shrank, still it was the same size as the previous one. The second object increased its speed by 20 3 times over the first object, and its color had changed to a pinkish red. This object was lower in altitude than the first and moved in the opposite direction than that of the first.

After sighting the first, two sentors, and they were called into the room, and they also saw the second object as it was flying north. These four boys agreed to what they saw, and they had no rational explanation for what it was.

This is the truth and there is no offense at this school. We'd appreciate your help and explanations if possible.

Yours truly,

Woodberry Forest

Feb. 20, 1967

Dear Major Quintanilla,

I wish to relate to you something extremely strange which occurred at our school, Woodberry Forest, near Orange, Virginia at 10:22 P.M. E.S.T. Feb. 15, 1967.

During that windy night, two boys were looking out their window, because the wind was blowing pretty hard. Greenish - white light, heading from the northeast to the south, caught the eye of one of the boys. It dimmed irregularly, changed courses several times, and even stopped in mid-air, a few times, but it always continued in the same direction.

Just before it disappeared over the trees, a bright light (pinkish-white) like a flash in the immediate vicinity where it disappeared. By the flash, the shape of the object was similar to that of a pocketwatch case.

A second object appeared in the
