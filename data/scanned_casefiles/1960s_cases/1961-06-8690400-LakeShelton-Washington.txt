1

8. COURSE
30°

9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Circular disc, small star like, with white center and many small green lights around the outside. Appeared at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. Moved slightly East. Appeared to be going away from observer. Faded in distance and disappeared behind trees.

10. COMMENTS
Witness stated that the object remained in the same general area and at the same elevation. Yet disappeared behind trees. In spite of this inconsistency it is probable that a light was reflected from the intense subsidence and radiation inversion present in the Pacific Northwest at the time.

11. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other
