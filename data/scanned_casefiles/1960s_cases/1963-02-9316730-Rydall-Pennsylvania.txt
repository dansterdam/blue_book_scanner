Dear Sirs:

I would like to report a sighting of an unidentified flying object. I first noticed this object at 6:15 P.M. Wednesday, February 13th. It was several degrees above the horizon and appeared a dull white color. At first I thought it was 7-10 miles (a few hundred) up. I noticed it at sky, 15°. The object then approached to become larger, that is, it grew in size and height. It drew to within a greater height of the horizon and seemed to stop in the sky.

They may be saying coming to pick me up at Cold Spring Road Simple with the aim of the attention to the object in the sky. It was a school, I called the attention and was told that something over the synagogue grounds. The object passed over the car.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

The scout again that the object
was in altitude using light and
was moving slowly. The
mother ship was in the clear
according to the scout
fuselage. It was rather to
find the delta wings.

The object started in
the west and proceeded
continued until it had passed
overhead. Its light thence
appeared to seem to point
to see. Its body to have
a sound form the sight.

It was at a low altitude
I would say.

I called an officer at
Neller. He was on plane and
talked to him. He had only distant
sighting plate at the base.
He said they had no such
plane there - that could fly
as slow as described.

Sincerely,

Age: 13 1/2
Rydell, Pa.

There is also a postmark visible with a date of FEB 14 1963, and a postage stamp in the upper right corner of the envelope.

The image appears to be the back of an envelope addressed to the Secretary of the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) at the Pentagon in Washington D.C.
