Real this would like to be a good start to see what could not, what wiuld the details of this report indicate? Several big beams were observed at night according to very strange light, a very unusual experience for the observer. The text describes seeing several big beams of light that moved in a very strange and unusual way. The observer seems perplexed and unsure of what they witnessed.

The text from the document is as follows:

The object that we were observing was clearly seen by me as was several others. We were traveling slowly and the object was stationary almost directly over the area where our highway was located. The object was described as round, disc shaped with a yellowish orange light around the edge and no bright light in the center. The object was estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed for about 3-5 minutes before it accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared from sight.

I have a deep conviction that what I saw was a bona-fide unidentified flying object. It did not behave like any conventional aircraft I have ever seen before.
