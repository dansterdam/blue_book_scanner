1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-49 presented by Major R. 
Quintanilla, TDDY/UFO, which consists of an analysis of 12 prints and two slides of a Perth, 
Australia UFO sighting to determine the likely cause of the unidentified image.

2. ANALYSIS: The analysis was completed jointly by Photo Processing (TDDP) and Photo 
Analysis (DDPA) personnel.

3. A positive identification or description of the UFO is not possible with the photo-
graphic information available; however, there are several comments which may prove 
relevant to the analysis:

   a. The image does not appear to be the result of any processing effect.

   b. It appears that the shutter speed used was considerably longer than the stated 1/2 
   second. The distance covered by the vehicles during the time of exposure, as indicated by 
   their light tracks, is much too high to have occurred in 1/2 second. In fact, a speed far 
   in excess of 100 MPH would be indicated by a 1/2 second exposure time. Speed calculations 
   for the vehicles were made using an average distance of 80 feet between light poles. Had 
   more exposures been available and had the image been more clearly defined, a broad approximation 
   of rate of movement could probably have been derived.

   c. It is noted that there is no reflection of the bright image on the water although it 
   was stated to be only 20 feet above the water. The reflections of the street lights are 
   quite evident. It is possible that some obstruction in the foreground could have blocked 
   the view of a reflection from the image.

   d. No measurements are possible due to the helation of the bright image.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

The photos enclosed belong to Life and were lent to one of our people by one of theirs as a personal favor with this stipulation - we must return them quickly.

At the same time, we are still committed to Congress to analyze these photos.

Would you make copies, return the originals (which are really copies of the originals) as quickly as possible, and use your copies for your analysis.

Hopefully, Klass's theories, publicized lately, can explain these photos?
