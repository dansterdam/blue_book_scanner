Major, USAF
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Sir:

Thank you for your letter of 23 March. I quite agree that the picture looks like some portion of the aircraft that I took it from. However with the exception of the outerpast that could be the wings leading edge, I can't find a damn thing on the airplane that resembles the rest of it.

Therefore I am enclosing three negatives that I took at the same time and the following data that I can remember:

a) The camera was a Japanese Mimoya
b) Focal length was Infinity
c) Altitude was 6-7000 ft. MSL
d) From the pilots window of a C-46
e) Locally was near the Plain of Jars, Laos

I will be leaving for home vacation on May 15th, so I request that your reply be sent to the address listed below.

Sincerely,

Capt. [redacted]
[location redacted], Ohio

765-3                                                UNCLASSIFIED

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT

ANALYST: Sgt. MOODY                                  PI: KENNEY                 DATE: 19 JAN 66

This report is in response to Work Order 65-62 submitted by Sgt D. N. Moody, USAF/UFO requesting an analysis of a film strip (3 frames) taken in Laos, March 1965, of an alleged UFO.

The photographs show an aerial terrain view with the unidentified object along the lower one-fourth of the frames. A positive identification of the object could not be made utilizing the limited material furnished. It does appear however, that the object photographed was in close range - both to the camera and the aircraft from which the photographs were taken. The left side of the object as viewed in the photographs appears to be dropped with some sort of material or cloth. Thereby obscuring that portion of the object which rises to a point in the extreme left portion of the print. The apparent short range of the object from the camera, together with the image sharpness as compared with the terrain background, and the fact that subject photography was taken from the pilot's window of an aircraft, tends to suggest the following possibilities: The ledge of the pilot's window, together with an unidentified object thereon, including the creping, is the object depicted. Additionally the "alleged" pilot tube is merely the visible portion of some part of the aircraft.

Dear Captain Pomeroy,

Reference your letter of 15 Mar 1965 requesting an evaluation of a photograph which you have taken. The object in the lower left hand corner of the photo appears to be a portion of the aircraft from which you took the picture. Evaluations of photographs are not made without the original negative/negatives and camera data such as, type of camera, lens setting, focal length etc.

Sincerely,

This report is in response to Work Order 65-62 submitted by TSgt D. N. Moody, IDE/V/TO requesting an analysis of a film strip (3 frames) taken in Saigon, March 1965, of an alleged UFO.

A positive identification of the object could not be made utilizing the limited material furnished. It does appear however, that the object photographed was in close range - both to the camera and the aircraft from which the photographs were taken. The left side of the object as viewed in the photographs appears to be draped with some sort of material or cloth thereby obscuring that portion of the object which rises to a point in the extreme left portion of the print. The apparent short range of the object from the camera, together with the image sharpness as compared with the terrain background, and the fact that the subject photograph was taken from the pilot's window of an aircraft, tends to suggest the following possibilities: The ledge of the pilot's window, together with an unidentified object, including the draping, is the object depicted.

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is a picture I have taken from the air. Can you tell me what it is? Looks to me like an airfoil of some sort including a pitot tube, ram-air intake and a very unusual sort of power plant.

This is my only copy, please return.
