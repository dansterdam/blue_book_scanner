message relayed from PACAF 01/0537z. "Three pilots noticed fine
contrail over Honolulu, Hawaii followed by breakup into three
parts and burnout". Thought to be satellite burnout.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Mars and Venus Still Prominent

February's brilliant night sky features the constellations Taurus, Aurora, Canis Major and Leo, as well as the planets Venus and Mars, James Stokley notes.

INCREASING in brilliance, an arc is to become this time of year the most prominent feature of the night sky, with Mars and Venus now more than ever prominent.

It is now about a month past the time of maximum brilliance for Venus in the evening sky, but it is still a magnificent evening star. In the northwestern sky in Use Major, the planet Mars is now well up in the west, and will have set by 10 p.m. This is a good time to observe the red planet.

Mercury Soon Above Horizon

Because Mercury, the innermost planet, is now in the sun's glare, it is a bit hard to spot. But it will get easier to see in the next few weeks. It is a little while after sunset. This is a good time to look for it in the west in the evening twilight. The time in the evening sky is low in the western sky, and Mercury will have set by 7 p.m.

Eclipse Comes to Astronomers

Since an eclipse path may reach any part of the earth, astronomically it may happen to be over a well-populated region, even though the eclipse itself may not be total or even annular.

This will happen on Feb. 15, when the path will be hidden in the region of eastern Europe and western Asia. This part of the world will be in the eclipse path.

The document also includes two star charts with constellation and star positions, and a note at the bottom of the charts reading "SYMBOLS FOR STARS IN ORDER OF BRIGHTNESS".

Attention: Mr.E.C.Tuokley

Dear Sir,

I have observed an unidentified object that may be the balloon that today's newspaper say has been launched from Wallops Island base and was missed or not under control.

DATE:   1960 February 16
TIME:   (U.T.)   19h 45m
COORDINATES:   R.A. 11h 40m approx.
               Decl + 33° approx.

MOTION:         slow
DIRECTION:      from EAST-NORTH EAST to WEST-SOUTH WEST
MAGNITUDE:      + 4

It cannot be the satellite Echo I because in these days this satellite is well observable in the evening going in opposite direction.

I am sorry I am not in a position to give you further informations, but during this observation I was operating with a telescope photographing.

Sincerely,

very truly yours
dr. U. Dall'Olmo

On February 19th a strange missile hit a house near Berlin Heights, Ohio, and smashed a force that it broke. A smash of slate on the roof before falling to the ground. When the owners of the farm checked later, the object had split into several pieces which were scattered over the side steps. The largest chunk is about four inches by two inches, and is made up of several states of translucent rock. The top layer resembles limestone, and the lower layer appears to be of a different substance. The rock is fused by intense heat.

No Case (Information Only)                                   28 February 1961 Lakevillet, Massachusetts

On February 28, 1961 an elongated UFO, yellow with a dark red edge and surrounded by "black smoke" illuminated the ground for 5 minutes near a house at Lakeville, Massachusetts. It caused the failure of electric lights in the house, but when the UFO moved from the area the house lights came on again. On its second pass above the house an odor like 'fat burning' was detected.

[Newspaper article headline: "Flying UFO Puts out Lights"]

The article text includes details about the sighting by Mr. & Mrs. Clarence Blackwood of Lakeville, describing the UFO's appearance, movement, and effects. It mentions the object was bright yellow with a dark red edge, visible low in the northeast sky. The article discusses the object's path, its impact on house lights, and observations by the witnesses.

The text also references Walter N. Webb, an astronomer and Chairman of a subcommittee, who stated a preliminary report about the sighting's characteristics.

The rest of the article appears to provide additional details about the UFO's movement and observations, but some parts are partially illegible due to the image quality.
