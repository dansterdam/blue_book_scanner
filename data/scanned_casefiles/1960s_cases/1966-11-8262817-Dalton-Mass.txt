TDEN/UFO                                                                  24 March 1967
Request for UFO Information

Mrs. [redacted]
Dalton, Massachusetts 01226

Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

Reference your letter of 15 February 1967 regarding your observation of unidentified flying objects over the Dalton, Massachusetts area. If you wish to complete the enclosed Form 164, our analysts will attempt to determine the stimulus responsible for the sightings.

You do not seem to realize how people could report a star, satellite, balloon, etc. as being a UFO. At first, Mrs. [redacted], I wondered the same thing. I would often ask myself how could an individual see a natural or conventional object and claim it to be a UFO. Our UFO investigators throughout the country have had persons from all walks of life point to stars, aircraft, satellites, and other various objects and say, "Look, there is another UFO; now it is moving!" This is proven fact.

The possibility does exist that extraterrestrial life can be found in other parts of the universe; however there has been no evidence to substantiate this hypothesis. This lack of conclusive evidence prevents us from accepting the hypothesis that extraterrestrial vehicles are visiting our planet. As far as the alleged UFOs being a result of classified military projects, I am completely unaware of any such experimental craft operating in your geographical area. You must remember that the Air Force does not test new weapons systems over populated areas. All experimental testing is rigidly controlled and is done in sparsely populated areas.

We do not have explanations for all of the sightings; however, you must remember that we are working with subjective data and this information is impossible to duplicate in the laboratory.

Thank you for your letter.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF

I sent Sir,

Object as reported in November of 1966 continue to appear every clear night, and on many cloudy night below the level of the clouds. We continue to observe both high and low-flying objects. Arrival time now 5:40 p.m. The sky is not even dusky at daylight when the first objects appear. One turned from Southwest Northeast and then coming stationary of 1/2 hr. It then sails off from where it had been before and returns in the direction from which it arrived. Every night!! Another arrives at the same time 5:40 p.m. and stays all night. Two smaller objects above it, or one above and one below. More and more trumped people report seeing these objects. If the Air Force has not seen these would me...

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Well, some hypothetically they are aliens (or Russian with) first arrival with these satellites. Signed, Co. at Cape Kennedy - these things have appeared who are incredible. We watched one on a few in for pinpoint after altitude, then across most of the horizon, and then just hovered. It traveled this distance in seconds.

If you actually have not seen these things, then surveillance of this area should be started immediately. The actions of these objects are most persistent and most delicate. However, I feel that you are well aware of what is going on. Reports have now come in from Westfield - sign of the attitude of the Air Force and also the intelligence of the American people. Quickly, such as these may get us a cover up now - but more and more people are seeing UFO's with their own. Your job will become increasingly more difficult. I no longer believe everything that I read in paper. Presumably not only other stories do the

I wish to add one more item to the statement that we have been watching. that does not exist. my brother-in-law watched a unusual object. it appeared to be a red with red lights in a row along its length. now I did not see this one myself, but he is not the type of person to go about hallucinating, nor is he prone to "make stories."

PS - Of 1060 sightings have been reported, he many have been seen and not reported. the true number of sightings must be extremely high. I know of at least 15 people in this immediate area, who have been watching, but not reporting.
