DEPT/UFO
Request for UFO Information

24 March 1967

Dalton, Massachusetts 01226

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

Reference your letter of 15 February 1967 regarding your observation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) on 13 February 1967. You mentioned that the sightings were very brief and you were unable to obtain a photograph, but you felt that the sightings were an attempt to determine the stimulus responsible for the sightings.

You mentioned seeing several bright lights in the sky, resembling balloons, etc. as being a UFO. At first, Mrs. [REDACTED] wondered if these could have been weather balloons, but according to your description you felt it to be a UFO. Our UFO investigators throughout the country have had persons from all walks of life, including scientists and officers in the armed forces, report similar sightings that they could not identify and considered to be a proven fact.

The scientific data does exist that extraterrestrial life can be found in other parts of the universe; however, there has been no evidence to substantiate this phenomenon visiting our planet. As far as the alleged UFOs being a result of classified military projects, I can assure you that the Air Force does not test new weapon systems over populated areas.

We do not have explanations for all of the sightings; however, you must remember that our investigative data and information is impossible to duplicate in the laboratory.

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,

VICTOR CUSTAFALLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Here is the text from the document:

Dear Sir,

Objects as reported in December of 1966 continue to be a cause of puzzlement and on many occasions might be mistaken for the usual run of the clouds. We continue to get reports of high and low flying objects. Careful investigation indicates that in many cases these are probably natural phenomena. However, when the objects appear to be structured and seem to maneuver in a purposeful manner, they certainly warrant further study. It was thus while observing an apparent brightly lighted object that it suddenly disappeared and then reappeared in another location, an indication that it was not merely a star or some other celestial body.

We also note several instances where the object was observed from two or more separate locations, confirming the reality of its presence. This lends credence to the report and certainly indicates it was not a figment of the imagination of a single observer.

For the Air Force has not seen this kind of report with any degree of frequency, but more thorough investigation appears warranted.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Ightly suggest that was not the object of investigation. Actually, my approach to the thing, theoretically, as we know them, probably well what they are not. I include:

1. a light beam
2. a gypsum
3. swamp gas
4. birds (a little slow when do they light up)
5. clouds (some reason)
6. fireflies
7. Trick to
8. muscles - in the background seen
9. hallus - with the normal type flame
10. satellites - had all night light ?
11. aircraft - may be an unusual occurrence
12. some made the that down to 500ft we might look at
not, in my opinion, cause panic and anxiety they occur not
according to the standards that this was a good test, they are
clearly not made or are.

The text in the document reads:

Case history - Dalton, Mass. 8262817 11/8/66
Case summary A - There are two distinct schools of thought on this case. One view sees it as a well-planned and executed hoax, while the other regards it as a genuine, if puzzling, report that merits serious consideration. The initial investigation supports the hoax theory, but a more detailed analysis raises some doubts. The details of the case, as reported, are as follows:
At about 6:15 p.m. on November 8, 1966, two high school students - a boy and a girl - reported seeing a large, luminous object hovering over a field near Dalton, Massachusetts. According to their account, the object was egg-shaped, about 60 feet in diameter, and was surrounded by a glowing corona or "aura" of light. It hovered silently for several minutes and then shot straight up and disappeared.
The students claim that the object was clearly visible and that they watched it for a full 10 minutes before it departed. They reported the incident immediately to their parents, who in turn notified the local police. A police investigation was promptly initiated.
You are actually have not seen these things, then sightings of the area should be started immediately. The actions of these objects are very persistent and most deliberate. However, I will tell you what you are well aware of what is going on from reliable reports. People are actually more who still have their own sighting experiences to report.

I wish I could give more details to the light that we have seen mentioning that do not exist. My brother-in-law, a military pilot, appeared to be the normal with real lights in a row at near altitude. Now I did not see this one myself, but he is not the type of person to go about hallucinating. Moreover, it is more or less the size of a person to be about hallucinating.

1951 - 54 1050 sightings have been reported. Everyone have been seen and most have been extremely high. The figure remains of sightings must be extremely high. Several at least 50 people might have been watching, but not reporting.
