Dear Sir:

I would like to tell of a strange flash of light that shone on the 14, 15, and 16 of August this year. We saw these flashes between 2100 and 2300 hours. It was about the size of a baseball and lasted from two to three seconds. We spotted the object while looking for a satellite that we have been watching for the past few nights. The object appeared before and after the satellite came. The first time we spotted it, it was at a ninety degree angle and traveling south. It was an orange light that went out after four seconds of observing it, then it would appear again in another direction.

Sincerely,
