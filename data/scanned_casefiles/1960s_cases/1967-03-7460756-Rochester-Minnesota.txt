FLYING SAUCER IN ROCHESTER - OR WHAT?

Local Lad Photographs
A Nearby Flying Object

By JOHN NOVOTNEY
Post-Bulletin Staff Writer

"I don't really believe in flying saucers from another planet, but I suppose its possible."

Mark Hrubetz, 12, son of Mr. and Mrs. D. L. Hrubetz, 1948 3rd Ave. NE, made this remark after taking the pictures that accompany this article.

They are the first reported pictures taken in the Rochester area of what appears to be a flying saucer. He took them March 12.

Mark said he looked out his living room window to see if the paperboy was coming, but instead saw a flying saucer-like object hovering near-like over the apartment building across the street from the Hrubetz home.

It was silver-colored and black around the outside edge, he said. A cloth or plastic - like material fluttered from the top of the stack in the center of the object, Mark said.

"It was awfully scared because it was so low," he said. It looked to him to be about the size of a car.

He raced out to the kitchen, got his camera and took three pictures of the round object before it lifted up out of sight. It was in view for only about 45 sec.

about 9:15 on a Sunday morning, and Mark was the only member of the family who was up at the time. His parents did not see the object, and he doesn't know of any neighbors who may have seen it.

"We thought Mark was seeing things when he told us," Hindes said, "and were really shocked when the pictures came back from the developers."

The object was over the apartment when he first saw it, but moved over the street by the time he took the pictures, he said. His camera was a "little cheap one he won in a contest."

The circular object "tilted or wobbled back and forth" as it moved, and then "shot up" at an angle out of sight, Mark said.

Most of the boy's class- (Continued on page 15)

Here is the text from the document:

He raced out to the kitchen, got his camera and took three pictures of the round object before it lifted up out of sight. It was in view for only about 45 seconds, and he could hear no sound from the object.

The boy was sincere when telling about the incident, and did not now appear to be attempting to perpetrate a hoax.

mates thought the pictures
were "pretty neat," Mark
said, but a few accused him
of rigging the pictures. He
insists he did not, and these
accusations have made him
reluctant to report it to Air
Force authorities.

"I am not about to let my
boy get up on the roof and
rig up something like that,"
Mrs. Hrubetz said, adding it
wouldn't be like him to do
that sort of thing, anyway.
Mark is interested in as-
tronomy and got a telescope
for Christmas.
