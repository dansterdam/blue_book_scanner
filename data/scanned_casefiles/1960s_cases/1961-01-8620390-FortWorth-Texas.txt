REPLY TO
ATIN CFI TA-3
SUBJECT: UFOs

18 January 1961

TO: ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. There have been sightings of UFOs in the vicinity of Sheppard AFB, Texas on 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15 January. Not all of these sightings were related.

2. The sighting of 9 January was made by Major Warren R. Aiken and Major Donald F. Taylor as they proceeded from the area of Altus AFB, Oklahoma to Sheppard AFB, Texas (see Atch #1). Major Aiken and Taylor appear to be highly reliable sources. Major Aiken has had much experience in investigating UFOs, so his conclusion, that the object he observed was probably a meteorite or a piece of rocket or satellite entering the earth on an orbital path, appears to be sound. No other sightings of this object were reported.

3. Reference my message of 13 January TA1702A concerning 10 January sightings. Many ground sightings correlate highly in the description and the path of the object sighted by Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] in the aircraft (see Atch #2 and #3) but, since these reports were received by the offices of local news media, the preparing officer was able to obtain only two witnesses' names. The testimony obtained from the 10 January sighting was somewhat unreliable, verifies unquestionably the description and path of the object sighted from the aircraft (see Atch #4). The cause and identity of this object remain unascertained.

4. The 11 January sighting was reported by Mrs. [redacted] whose judgment and reliability seem questionable. It is significant that this sighting took place on the day that the local paper featured the 10 January sighting. Mrs. [redacted] seemed overly insistent that she saw a "cigar shaped object" (see Atch #5) and she described it as a "cigar shaped," the much-used description for UFOs. She left the sighting momentarily to get her husband to see the object, and when they observed the sky together, no other persons reported seeing this object, which seems unlikely if it hovered in the sky for 30 minutes only. A few miles away, it is the preparing officer's conclusion that the object was an illusion, or that Mrs. [redacted] was seeing publicity.

5. Mr. [redacted] programmer and weatherman for KFDX-TV, Wichita Falls, reported that he saw an extremely bright object in the southwest as he drove from Munter, Oklahoma to Frederick, Oklahoma (see

itch #6). Mr. judgement and reliability seem high. There were
no other reported sightings of this object. The operating officer is
unable to estimate the cause or identity of this object.

5. On 15 January from approximately 0315 to approximately 0330Z
Mr. other employee of KFMY-TV sighted from the
station, on the Southwest end of Wichita Falls, an object at about
250 and 100 from the horizon. The object appeared the same as the
one sighted 11 January (see Atch #6), except that it did not emit a
glow at intervals. The preparing officer is unable to determine
the cause or identity of the object.

A UFO. WAS STAR IS THE WITNESS REFERRING TO AS THE EVENING STAR?
WAS THE WITNESS INSIDE A BLDG WHEN THE OBJ WAS FIRST SEEN? IF SO,
DID HE GO OUTSIDE DURING THE OBSERVATION? WERE THERE SHADOWS CAST
BY THE OBJECT'S BRIGHTNESS? IF THE WITNESS HAS EVER OBSERVED ECHO I,
COMPARE THE SPEED OF THE OBJ TO THAT OF ECHO I. HOW WAS THE SPEED
OF THE OBJ DETERMINED? HOW WAS HIS DURATION OF THE SIGHTING
DETERMINED? CONFIRM THE SPEED AND DURATION. TO WHAT ALTITUDE DID
THE OVERCAST EXTEND? WAS THE OVERCAST THEN ENOUGH THAT AN OBJ SUCH
AS THE MOON COULD BE SEEN THROUGH IT? HAS A CHECK BE MADE TO
DETERMINE IF THERE WERE ANY ACFT IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. HIS
