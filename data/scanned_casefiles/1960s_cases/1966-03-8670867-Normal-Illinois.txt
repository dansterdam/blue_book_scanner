10. CONCLUSION
AIRCRAFT (DC-3)
The DC-3 was 25 minutes late. A low pass was made over the top prior to letdown at the airport. A slow descending pattern was flown. The lighting configuration on the DC matches that of the UFO.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was described as being oblong in shape like a football. The lights were red and green, separated by a white and red alternating light with blinking on top. Object was about 20 deg. above the horizon when sighted and disappeared at tree tops, gradually in the ENE.

1830 hrs CST:

Interview with the [redacted]

"We were out in back playing basketball when my young brother said, hey Steve look at how low that plane is. I ran to the front of the yard and watched it flying. I didn't think it was a plane. It was moving from the southwest to the northeast. It was moving real slow. It had a green light on the bottom, red, white and blue lights across the front. All the lights were blinking. It was oblong oval shaped. I didn't tell this before but it had two antenna coming out of the top and two antenna coming out of the bottom. It wasn't making any sound at all. It appeared to hover overhead staring at us. Then it moved over toward Main Street toward Krogers. Then it appeared to hover right over the trees back of the house. It was diving and climbing and changing its speed. When we ran toward it, it dived out of sight to the north east. A teacher spotted a bright orange ball of light in his back yard but didn't report it. A friend of mine, Roger Simpson, he's no relative, saw the UFO and was listening to his walkie talkie at the time. When the UFO came close, it caused interference on his set. The interference went away when the UFO went out of sight."

Mrs Simpson: "I saw the UFO above the tree top level. It had blinking lights. Red, white and Green. No, Steve it wasn't blue. You said it had a blue light but I didn't see it. The lights quit working when the object moved out of sight toward the Kroger area. I'd say we watched the object for about 3 to 5 minutes."

Steve Simpson: "Here, let me show you how it looked. (He left and obtained a copy of a dated "Coronet Magazine" and showed me a picture of a UFO, which was in reality a picture of a U-2). The thing that got me was that it hovered over us looking at us. When we ran toward it, it turned and ran. I'm sure it wasn't an airplane. I'd guess the UFO was about a couple of hundred feet in the air."

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

1. I believe that the persons contacted did in fact see something and that all witnesses were reliable to a degree. The fact that all agreed on the time of the sighting, the area of sighting, the colors of lights, the colors of the object, the fact that the object apparently had lacked sound generating capabilities and finally they all agreed on the basic flight direction, all these facts tend to strengthen the fact that the UFO was in fact a DC-3 in flight over the city.

a. The wind at the time of the incident was west southwest at about fifteen knots. Since this would tend to blow the sound away from the sighting area, this would answer the questions on the lack of sound.

b. Since an overhead pattern is flown by the airlines arriving at the Bloomington airport at night, and since these patterns are made at a relatively low altitude in order to determine the wind direction and landing runway, these facts would account for the changes in direction the low slow speed of the object and since the aircraft are descending for landing, they usually have power reduced in order to lose airspeed and descend into the pattern.

c. The sky condition on the night of the incident was overcast and ragged. Under these conditions it is almost impossible to determine the shape of the object while in flight. The lights of the city reflecting on the bottom of the object in question, could and usually do present to the viewers, a strange contrast of light and shadow effect.

d. The DC-3 operated by the Ozark Airlines, arrives at the Bloomington airport each night at about 1850 hours CST. On the night in question, the airlines was 25 minutes late as evidenced by the Ozark operations log. This information places the airliner over the city of Normal, Illinois at the precise time of the UFO sighting. The standard lighting configuration of the DC-3 is comparable to that of the UFO when viewed from various angles. The question of the Blue Light is solved when you consider the fact that blue is quite easily mistaken for green at night. Atmospheric conditions at night can cause colors to be mistaken by the bending and absorbing of light rays.

e. I feel that most witnesses were reliable until facts became confused fantasy as in the case of Steve Simpson. Prior to his sighting of the UFO, he admitted that he was very familiar with the sightings in Michigan. His testimony on the antennas was revealed two days after the original sighting. Also comments on "hovering right overhead, starting at us, blinking its light at us," running away as we ran toward it, etc., are added as after thought since he stated originally that the object flew from the southwest to the northeast and then descended out of sight. The more a witness talked about the sighting, the more the sequence of events became and the more additional fantasies were included. For example, Mrs. Simpson had to disagree with her son on the number of lights, the colors of lights and the flight path of the object after he had changed his original testimony.


- page 3 -

2. In conclusion, all facts point toward the UFO being the DC-3 and vice-versa.

3. Recommend that the civilian population be informed as to the proper procedure for reporting the sightings of UFO's. This would eliminate the costs of investigating fantasies and know flights of air vehicles.

Unidentified Flying Object Mystifies Normal Viewers

By STEVE VOGEL
Ray Floyd Jr., 12, of 914 W Division, Normal, sat talking to a reporter about the unidentified flying object he, five of his friends and four adults reportedly seeing early Tuesday night.

"Maybe you shouldn't be telling people about this," interjected his mother. She had also seen the strange air—or space—craft.

"Maybe I shouldn't," laughed young Ray. "Pretty soon the men in the white coats will be after me!"

Crazy? Laugh if you wish, but 10 Bloomington-Normal residents are the latest of scores of persons in the Midwest reporting UFOs this week.

First, reported sighting of the object was by the Merle Simpson family of 918 W. Division from about 7:15 p.m. The Simpsons' youngest son, Jimmie, 8, said he first saw it approaching from the southwest while he and his three brothers played basketball.

The craft, said to be oval in shape, soared soundlessly at height estimated at 200 to 500 feet and had four blinking lights — green light on the "bottom" and three others (blue, white and red) on the side.

"Look at the airplane," yelled Jimmie. But as the craft approached, the boys said it was neither an airplane nor a helicopter, nor a weather balloon.

The boys called their parents' attention to it and soon after, that of Mrs. Floyd and her son. The witnesses said the ship flew over them, hovered near a group of trees several blocks northeast of their homes and then proceeded southeasterly. They said they had the craft in sight for more than a minute and as it "had finished exploring," flew to the southeast, and then dipped.

Area Searched
"I don't know if it landed—don't get me wrong there," said Steve Simpson, 15-year-old ninth grader at Chiddix, "but I saw it dip down and out of sight." The boys searched the area near Main Street where they thought it could have set down, but found nothing.

Mrs. Floyd, having stepped outside to look for a taxi when the Simpsons called her attention skyward, said she saw it hover over the trees. "Now I admit that my glasses need to be changed," she said, "and I saw just the one red light." But she was sure that she saw something, and that something was not an airplane. "It didn't seem to take off of very fast," she recalled.

Normal police investigated the sighting. "I don't know what to think about it," said Patrolman Robert Fowler. He said that the children backed up what their children had said. "There was enough of them who saw it," he said. "It sure beats me. But I don't think there's anything to get excited about."

Twice In Michigan
It was just Monday night that a Civil Defense director, an assistant dean and 87 coeds in Hillsdale, Mich., reported seeing a glowing object zip past a college dormitory and hover in a swamp for hours.

And Sunday night a similar craft had been seen by more than 50 persons, including 12 police and firemen near Ann Arbor, Mich. Those objects (or objects) were described as roughly in the shape of a football.

The Air Force announced it was sending Dr. H. Allen Hynek, chairman of Dearborn observatory at Northwestern University and scientific consultant.

1345 hrs CST:     Departed Rantoul, Illinois for Normal.

1505 hrs CST:     Arrived in Normal, Illinois and proceeded to the Police Station for an interview with the Chief of Police, Captain Hanna. Made a preliminary check of the persons involved, a check of the weather in the area on the night of the incident, a check of the terrain including the area of the sighting. The area of the sighting is situated approximately 3 miles parallel to the runways at the airport (see attachment 5). The area of the sighting is heavily wooded, with tall trees in all directions. The area is approximately one city block from the railroad tracks, in a slight depression. The exact location of the area is 3 miles northwest of the runways at the Bloomington airport. The wind on the night of the sighting was west-south-west at about 15 knots. The sky condition was 2,000 broken to overcast with a ragged condition.

1600 hrs CST:     Proceeded to the [redacted] residence at [redacted] to interview the [redacted] years old.

"I was in the house when my neighbor, [redacted] ran over and told me to come outside and see the UFO in the air. I ran outside and looked to the southeast and saw the object moving from the southeast to the northeast. It was fairly high in the sky and was shaped like a long football. It had a green light on the bottom, red, white and a blue light in that order on the side. I think all the lights were blinking. It was very hard to tell what shape the object was."

Question: "What was the weather condition?"
Answer: "Well, it was real cloudy and a little windy."

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Proceeded to interview Mr. "I did not really see the object very clearly since my glasses aren't very good. It didn't look like the Ozark airliner that comes over the area every night about 7 o'clock. I saw it for about 15 seconds moving from the NW to the SE. I'm sorry I can't tell you more about it, but I really didn't see it very well."

1730 hrs CST: Called Mis student at the Illinois Wesleyan University.

Miss "At first I thought it was an airplane. I was walking east on Phoenix Avenue on campus, and looked up and saw the blinking lights. I really couldn't tell you what the shape was. It did have a blinking red light on it and I kinda think it was an airplane. My friend who was walking with her boyfriend, student who also saw the object. Tom is a science student and he said that it wasn't an airplane. This all happened about 7 o'clock in the evening."

1740 hrs CST: Called

"I was walking north at about 6:45 PM. The object I saw did not look like a small Cessna. I am familiar with airplanes since I have flown in them for about 200 hours. My roommate has a Cessna and we fly together quite a bit. This object was about 1000 feet high, it had red, white and blue blinking lights. It normally moved very slowly and made quick turns. I watched it for about 15 to twenty minutes. It did not make any noise at all. I remember it was quite cloudy that night. The basic direction was from Bloomington towards Normal, north from Normal and then to the east when it went out of sight. I could not tell you what shape it had if any. I'm sure it wasn't any airplane. I'm a science student and have flown before and I'd know an airplane if I saw it."

1800 hrs CST: Call to Ozark Airlines,

Mr. "The weather on the night of the sighting was 3 thousand broken, 1 thousand overcast with ragged ceilings. The wind was WSW at about 15 knots. Normally a DC-3 out of Chicago arrives at 6:51 and departs at 7:01. It flies V-9 from Pontiac to Bloomington. The runway in use was 22. On this particular night, the DC-3 was 25 minutes late. It landed around 7:15. The standard lighting is Red left wing tip, green right wing tip, Red rotating anti-collision on top of the tail and a red and white alternating on the back of
