1830 hrs CST:
This was when my young brother said, hey Steve, look at how low that plane is. I ran to the porch of the yard and watched it flying. I didn't think it was a plane, it was moving real slow. Actually it was the DG-3 flying over the city.

Interview with the Simpsons:
My wife and I were in back playing basketball when my young brother said, hey Steve look at how low that plane is. I ran to the porch of the yard and watched it flying. I didn't think it was a plane, it was moving real slow. Actually it was the DG-3 flying over the city. 

It flew a right hand pattern making a right base for landing at Bloomington Normal. Since there is not a tower, the DG-3 usually makes a pass to check the wind before they proceed on a downwind to base for landing. About 5 people called in and said they saw a UFO. Actually it was the DG-3 flying over the city.

Steve Simpson: Here, let me show you how it looked. (He obtained a copy of a dated "Coronet Magazine" and showed me a picture of a U-2, which was in reality a picture of a UFO, which was in reality nothing more than the DG-3 making a normal landing approach.)

The looking thing that got me was that it hovered over us looking to be maybe 3 to 4 hundred feet in the air. I'm sure the UFO was about a couple of hundred feet in the air.

Mrs Simpson: I saw the UFO above the tree top level. It had blinking lights, red, white and green. No, Steve, I didn't see it. The lights quit working when the object moved out of sight. I'd say we watched it for about 5 minutes.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

1. I believe that the persons contacted did in fact see something and that all witnesses were reliable to a degree. The fact that all agreed on the time of the sighting, the area of sighting, the colors of lights, the shining character of the fact that all had noticed sound directions, all these facts tend to strengthen the fact that the UFO was a real object in flight over the city.

2. The wind at the time of the incident was west south west at about fifteen knots. Since this would tend to blow the sound away from the sighting area, this would support the fact that no sound was heard.

3. Since an overhead pattern is flown by the airlines arriving at the Bloomington airport, and since these patterns are made at a relatively low altitude in order to determine the wind direction and landing runway, one could account for the strange object in question accidentally descending in flight below these patterns. As landings are made, they usually have power reduced in order to lose airspeed and descend into the landing patterns.

4. The sky condition on the night of the incident was overcast and hazy. Under these conditions, it is almost impossible to determine the size of the object while in flight. The lights of the city reflecting on the bottom of the object in question could and usually do present to the viewer a strange contrast of light and shadow effect.

5. The DC-3 operated by the Ozark Airlines, arrives at the Bloomington airport, has a height of about 16 feet and a wing span of about 95 feet. This information places the airliner over the city of Normal, Illinois at the precise time of the UFO sighting. The standard lighting configuration of the DC-3 is comparable to that of the UFO when viewed from various angles. The fact that the pilot and co-pilot of this plane identified the lights as their own is strong evidence that the object sighted and the incident may have been actually the DC-3 airliner under certain conditions at night can cause colors to be mistaken by the bending and absorption of light rays.

6. I feel that most witnesses were reliable until facts became confused as in the case of Steve Simpson. Prior to his sighting of the object, his recollection of the sequence of events was quite normal. However, when he saw the object, his subsequent imagination was greatly aroused, and this undoubtedly colored his report and changed his original sighting. Also, comments on 'hovering and stationary flight' at the blinking lights overhead starred adding as after thought since he stated originally that the object moved from the northern lights to the northeast and then lost in the clouds. As more the sequence of events became and the more the additional fantasies were excluded. For example, Mrs Simpson had to disagree with her son on the number of lights, the colors of lights and the flight path of the object after she had changed his original testimony.

In conclusion, all facts point toward the UFO being the DC-3 and

Recommend that the civilian population be informed as to the proper procedure for reporting the sightings of UFO's. This would eliminate the costs of investigating fantastic and known flights of air vehicles.

LATEST OF MANY
Unidentified Flying Object
Mystifies Normal Viewers
By STEVE VOGEL
Ray Shields, 19, of 1614 W. Division, was interviewed by a Daily Reporter about the unidentified flying object he saw Tuesday night. He said:
"I was just sitting here about dusk, seeing early Tuesday night.
Maybe you shouldn't," laughed young people's suspicion of seeing an unidentified object isn't new, around here after me!"
Crash? Laugh if you wish, but Ray saw something no one else seemed to see. Police and residents are the latest of scores of persons in this Midwest reporting seeing something in the sky.
C.V.J. Saunders, first reporter sighting of the object, was a member of the family of Div. W. Division, said Tuesday to be seen in the sky. "The first time I saw it approach Bloomington," said he first saw it approach the southbound while he and his brothers played basketball The craft, said to be oval in shape, seemed to hover for more than a minute, and as it "had finished exploring
the area, then proceeded southeasterly.
They said they had the craft in sight for more than a minute and as it "had finished exploring the area, then proceeded southeasterly.
Area Searched
"Don't know if it landed - don't get me wrong if theÂ¬re," said
Steve Simpson, a 15-year-old ninth grader in Normal, told the Air Force's "project blue book" about the "large white object" he saw Tuesday night. 
The boys searched the area near Tri State Supper Club, where they said they saw the object, but found nothing.
"I never seen anything like it before," Mrs. Phyllis Howard, having stepped outside to see some "unusual lights," said she saw the Simpsons call her attention skyward, and she saw it hover over the trees. "Now I admit that my glasses need to be changed," she said, "but I was sure that she saw something, and that something was an airplane. "It didn't seem to take off very fast," she recalled.
Normal police investigated the sighting. "I don't know what to think about it," said Robert Pawley. He said that the children of the parents backed up what their children had said. "There were enough of them who saw it to make me wonder," he said, "but I don't think there's anything to it." 
It was in a similar Monday night that young Mike Howard, director, an air traffic controller at Bloomington's Municipal Airport, reported sighting a glowing object the size of a football with a bright tail that hovered for hours.
And Sunday night a similar object, described as being over 50 persons, including 12 policemen, was sighted. The Air Force announced it was sending Dr. H. Allen Hynek, chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University and scientific consultant of Project Blue Book, to investigate the sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

Proceeded to interview Mrs. ______ "I did not really see the object very clearly since my glasses aren't very good. It didn't look like the Ozark Airlines plane I saw it for about 15 seconds moving from the NW to the SE. I'm sorry I can't tell you more about it, but I really didn't see it very well."

Called Miss ______ student at the Illinois Wesleyan University.
"At first I thought it was an airplane. I was walking east on Sherman Avenue on campus and looked up and saw the blinking lights. I really couldn't tell you what the shape was. It did have a blinking red light on it and I kind of think it was an airplane. The object was not a normal airplane shape. It was totally different with these also white and blue blinking lights. Tom is a science student and he said that it wasn't an airplane. This all happened about 7 o'clock in the evening."

"I was walking north at about 6:45 P.M. The object I saw did not look like a small Cessna. I am familiar with airplanes since I have flown in them for about 20 hours. This object was about 1000 feet up, seemed very large, round, white and blue blinking lights. It normally moved very slowly and made quick turns. It did not make any noise at all. I remember it was quite close to me. The blasting direction was from Normal and then to the east when it went out of sight. I could not tell you what shape it had if any. I'm sure it wasn't any airplane. I'm a science student and have flown before and I've never seen an airplane like this."

Call to Ozark Airlines, ______
"The weather on the night of the sighting was 3 thousand broken at 6,500 feet. The wind was W3W at about 15 knots. Normally a DC-3 out of Chicago arrives at 6:51 and departs at 7:03. It flies V-2 from Pontiac to Bloomington. On this particular night the runway was used by the DC-3. On this particular night the standard lighting is Red left wing tip, Green right wing tip, Red rotating anti-collision on top of the tail and a red and white alternating on the back of the tail."
