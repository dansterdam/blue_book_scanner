Dear Major Yorke,

I am in receipt of your inquiry reference letter explaining the for that my alleged sighting was in motion on their second phenomena. Thank you. This, my observation I may give a few more details, please let me know. The good thing, you mentioned six more investigations in the past (?) years have been proved "almost conclusively" that there was no logical explanation for all aerial phenomena.

I am led to believe that this has been reported that there 29 (?) "flying explanation" will go far in on this perspective.

I have been in touch with some newspaper in the vicinity, and time files are filled with 1970 mile, what shows some been so yet some during it press on me. At the prime some rising opportunities for writing 1968.

AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI-PB (Mrs Geise)
Wash 25 D C

1. The following information is provided to assist you in answering
a letter from _________ correspondence from him. Our records indicate no previous
correspondence.

2. There is no point in discussing the belief that UFO's are real,
extraterrestrial and under intelligence control with Mr _________. 
Acceptance of these points are done with an act of faith, without
scientific support. There is also no point in sending him an
information sheet. However, since he has requested information
relative to UFO's the information should provide him with the Air
Force's position.

3. Regarding the sighting at Easton, Massachusetts, August 1963,
it is apparently a meteor observation, however, the duration was
not reported and motion of the object not included. If the flight
was straight and the duration short this would be the Air Force
evaluation. If Mr _________ desires further information, it is
suggested that he fill out the form 164 and forward the completed
form to your office.

4. The information provided on the South Weymouth, Massachusetts
sighting is insufficient for even a tentative analysis.

March 11, 1964

Dear Mr.

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you reported the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object in Easton, Mass. in August of 1963, and one seen by your mother-in-law in South Weymouth.

Your sighting at Easton is apparently a meteor observation, however, the duration was not reported and motion of the object was not included in your letter. The information provided on the South Weymouth sighting is insufficient for even a tentative analysis.

In over 8,000 cases during the past 16 years, there has never been any evidence or indication that Unidentified Flying Objects represent spaceships from other planets. On the contrary, Air Force investigations have proved most conclusively that these are local explanations for all aerial phenomena, whether created and sent aloft by man, generated by atmospheric conditions, or caused by celestial bodies and their residue of meteors, etc.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF

Mr.
Rockland, Mass.
