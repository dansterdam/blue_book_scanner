BOTH INVESTIGATORS, DUE TO THE OBSERVERS AGE, BACK-
GROUND, AND THEIR REPORTS, FEEL THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT
A METEORITE, FALLING-STAR OR ANY OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENON.
THE PATH OF FLIGHT TO WHICH THE OBJECT MAINTAINED AND THE
SPEED AT WHICH IT TRAVELED COULD LEAVE NO OTHER OPINION
THAN THAT IT COULD BE A SELF-POWERED PROJECTILE. ALL
