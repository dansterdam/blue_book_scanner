6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
2 min

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
White, starlike object. About as bright as
Polaris. Irregular speed about a degree and a
half per second. The object appeared to move
from about 5° E of Polaris, the trajectory
continued until the object was slightly N of
zenith, and then continued to S. Appeared to
wobble or oscillate in a similar manner to the
Echo satellite, however it was less bright and
traveled at a much greater speed. Altitude less
than that of Echo.

one

11. COMMENTS
The satellite 59 Agena 2 was in the
vicinity at about the time of the sighting.
However, it is somewhat that the object,
visible to the naked eye, even though the
object was observed through binoculars.
Object apparently in orbit. Intrusion
slightly to E of S at disappearance. Not
"wrong-way" satellite. Case listed as
insufficient data.

DATE: Oct. 23, 1960.

SUBJECT: Observation of Oct. 12, 1960, 9:45 p.m. EDT.

Looks like a pretty definite U.O. Believe the only polar white now are 29 miles-2 and 60 Theta. This former was in the vicinity around this time but is very doubtful (notes in the sky is very inaccurate); also this satellite should be very much fainter than Polar. 

From the observed time, 60 Theta is a bright object but was way out. His object must have been seen for only 14 minutes, or else his reported angular speed should have been nearer 1° per second.

White

Hq

This appeared to be another object in the near vicinity of the sun not visible to the naked eye. This object was first sighted with 7x50 binoculars, and appeared to be traveling at 9 o'clock, south.

Binoculars

The object appeared to move from about five degrees east of Polaris, the trajectory continued until the object was slightly east of south, and then southerly heading. However, it appeared to be slightly east of south as it approached the horizon. It appeared to wobble or weave in a similar manner to the Echo satellite. However, it was less bright and traveled at a much greater speed. Apparently, its altitude was possible less than 5 miles. This observation was made from 8:45 to 9:00 in perfectly clear weather.
