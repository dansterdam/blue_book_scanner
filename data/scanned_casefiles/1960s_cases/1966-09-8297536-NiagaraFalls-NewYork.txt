There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a hand-written document containing text describing events related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) between 1952 and 1969.

The text describes various sightings, encounters, and details related to UFO observations. It includes dates, times, locations, and other specifics about the reported incidents.

TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

"Occurred on September 7, 1966 in Niagara Falls, New York. At approximately 2200 hours, Mrs. Ella Parman, age 61, was sitting on her porch and observed two strange objects hovering over the Niagara River. The objects were described as round in shape, about 20-30 feet in diameter, and were reddish-orange in color. Mrs. Parman stated that the objects appeared to be about 500-600 feet above the river and were completely silent. The objects maneuvered around for about 10 minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.

Sept 23rd Cables on to Base - Talked with Capt. Thompson. He had completed the flights and put the film on at 920 pm for me to examine. Film was apparently good and not damaged but did not give much additional information.

Sept 24th 1966 USAF in went assigned about 900 pm. Told them all I could and played the film.

Sept 25th Records show at 4:30 pm Niagara Falls police had several calls concerning a red light in the sky."

Rice, 29, apparently noticed an object which seemed brighter and larger than stars in the sky. What it was I could not have said, as it did not remain long enough for me to make a careful observation of it. It seemed to be moving along a course at a speed no greater than a slow moving car. When I reached home the object had disappeared.

Sept. 26th
Mr. Charles Cutts, of Buffalo, reports he sighted one bright object which moved past in the sky, from west to east, for several seconds. Called wife and children to view it. The object seemed quite distant, and of a definite circular shape, reflected a light like moonlight. Duration of observation, probably a minute and a half.

The house at 7:35 PM to make a purchase of gasoline. Cutts and Mrs. Cutts were in the driveway. Mrs. Cutts saw an object, apparently at an altitude of about 45 degrees in a north-easterly direction. She said it was circular, moving straight and level, reflecting light like that of a match flame on a dark night. It was observed for about 20 seconds, and then disappeared through the haze. Mrs. Cutts called Cutts' attention to the object, but he did not see it until it had almost gone out of sight. It appeared to be at a considerable distance.

Capt. Morgan and Miss Johnston were visiting with me for a while. Discussed UFO's a little, but there was no other observation made at that time.

Text from the document:

"... and concerning sightings and incidence observed by trained observers in scientific fields. In this connection, it is noted that in Niagara Falls, New York, on 8 September 1966, an illuminated object was observed moving in a erratic manner across the sky and seen by a number of people. This object was sighted at approximately 11:00 p.m., 8 September 1966, and was seen by a meteorologist and others at this location. The object left no trail and moved with great speed and precision. Efforts to track the object with radar were not successful. This incident would be of interest and concern to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as being another sighting by trained and responsible observers. Therefore, this information is provided for your consideration and any action deemed appropriate."

As an OCR system, I have produced the following text from the document:

I have made a diligent search among the files available to me in an effort to locate any information which might be of assistance to you regarding the object which was reported to have been observed at Niagara Falls, New York, on September 8, 1966. I will, of course, relate to you all of the facts and details that I have been able to ascertain in connection with this case. 

This people had a white color, and seemed to be surrounded by a slight glow of a pale-blue color. The object was approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter and was observed to have a very rapid hovering and darting motion. It was reported to have been observed by four persons and they were all trained observers - a detective, a college student, a businessman, and a former member of the Air Force. Their testimony indicates that the object was in view for some 5 to 10 minutes, and they were able to make a good visual observation of it. They reported that the object appeared to be under intelligent control, and that they observed a slight pulsating motion, and a humming sound was audible as the object approached and departed. 

I regret that I do not have any additional information or physical evidence which I could make available to you in this case. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to assist you in your investigation of this incident.

NO CASE   INFO ONLY

On the morning of September 8, 1966, a very bright and silent object was observed north of Buffalo, New York, near Niagara Falls.

The object was much brighter than any stars and larger than any aircraft. It was hovering and moved in a zig-zag pattern, changing directions sharply. It remained visible for approximately 15 minutes.

No sound was heard. The object flew low, then climbed up and then descended sharply. It then seemed to move out of sight. Several people observed this object.

I. PURPOSE:
Analysis of an igneous rock-like sample.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
1. The fused sample was submitted to MAAD to determine the material's composition and identify the alloy.
2. A spectrographic analysis of the material showed it to be alpha ferric oxide (Fe2O3).

III. CONCLUSION:
Since the spectrographic analysis of the sample did not reveal an established alloy system, no apparent source or use for this material could be determined from the composition.

IV. RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

b. As you know, Amherst is only 10 miles from Niagara Falls, however, the telescopic study of an object at Amherst led Special Delivery personnel to report the object to the UFO officer. After mentally disturbing the children, she is about thirty (30) years old and has a (2) children, she oldest one being nine (9). She was constantly complaining how loud they were and that the radio was on full blast all day. Their unusual figures were completed.

However, Objects sighted during our visit were stars and airplanes. However, the missiles they are not aliens but communications systems from the UFO's mentioned also introduced me to them.

This morning, 30 September 66, she called me and said she was not afraid and brought the spotlights from the central office. The report-lights she was referring to were located at new car dealers' lots, arriving with the new 1967 model cars.

Again I say, the only reason I am forwarding this is to let you know it has been looked into and if an inquiry does arrive, you have an answer.

Subject: Sightings of UFO's

During the last week of August, 1966, 3 - 4 persons working iir the tower at the Niagara Falla Airport, Niagara Falls, New York, have been concerned witnessing events in the sky which they believe might have some significance from a military standpoint.

Beginning on Sept 1st, 1966 UFO sighted, apparently circling around an area at high altitude, and then descending lo a lower altitude. This UFO silhoueltea was observed over the greater part ot the day by several observers, and was described as being metallic in appearance, glistening in the sunlight. Although I did not observe this UFO myself, I did talk to some of the observers, and they appeared to be quite sincere in their descriptions, and stated that the UFO had no visible means of propulsion, and appeared to maneuver without any audible sounds.

Sept 4th, 1966  UFO sighted, apparently approaching the Airport complex along the Niagara River, at a moderate altitude. This UFO showed definite features, i.e. reddish glow, conical shape, and there was no sound associated with its passage. It passed over the Airport, and disappeared from view.

Sept 7th, 1966  Drone-like aircraft circled the Niagara Falls Airport area for approximately 20-30 minutes, at low altitude. This craft was described as being disc-shaped, with a reddish glow around the periphery, and no sound was noted. Witnesses to this sighting were Maintenance personnel, aj 330 Bombardment Training Squadron, located at the Niagara Falls Airport.

I feel that this event, with no known explanation, should be of interest to your office, and any additional information or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

As the distance became less it seemed to position a pattern high & bright lights would appear to descend then ascend and this sequence seemed to be repeated many times. About 1:30 am I saw this strange object again and it seemed now to have increased greatly in size. It did not remain stationary but moved in the sky. I gathered from what I saw that this object although seemingly a considerable distance away, was of immense size. The about 1:30 am I heard outside the park railing & viewing this strange object again. It seemed now to have greatly increased in size. It did not remain stationary but moved in the sky.

This evening about 7:30 PM the writor was directed to investigate a report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object over the Niagara Falls, N.Y. area. The sighting had occurred at approximately 7:10 PM and was reported to the Niagara Falls Police Department. 

Upon arrival at the scene, the writer found two women who had observed the object. They stated that they were driving eastbound on Niagara Falls Blvd. near 66th St. when they first sighted the object. It was bright and appeared to be hovering over the area for several minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.

The object was described as round in shape, with a bright white light in the center. It appeared to be approximately the size of a basketball held at arm's length. The women reported that the object had no other distinguishing features and made no sound. After the object disappeared, the women immediately reported the sighting to the police.
