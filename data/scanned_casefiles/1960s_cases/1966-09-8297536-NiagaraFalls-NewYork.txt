Sept 23rd Called Air Force Base - spoke with Capt Hagen
re sighting - did not give him all the facts as I
knew them to tell me not to worry. Called him
back and gave more information. He called to come

Morning. Called Capt. Meyer at AF Base -
requested to bring someone west in discharge full

means of communication with space craft.

Left home at 7:30 PM to meet a picture at
Settlers Cliff Store in Bristed Mills Shopping
Center. Go to railroad home across Maple Rd
towards intersection with Rte 263 I saw an
object flying through the air from the direction
of my route, toward my car the object
then moved about of my cart in the air.
I turned south into Franktown Rd the
object strangely changed direction and moved
parallel to my auto. When I pulled with the
discovery the object its my higher then this

they were communications devices from the

been talking to these devices since the fifteenth
of September attempting to tell them how
to behave if they wished to land.

written report of all events which had occurred.

I started that I was not a star but only the communications object & was familiar with, as I looked up & saw it described and I spoke to it as Capt Meyers told Searles me.

I explained he was the government representative & had headquarters army a facility for their scientific. I stated he did not believe he was seeing a communications device, but just a star which gave an optical illusion of movement. Capt Meyers did not address the object. When I stopped speaking he drifted as could high into the sky and became stationary.

After a few minutes more I got increasing interest was made by their officer as to what they had observed. Both were courteous and attentive to my statements and performed their jobs with efficiency that recommended to write a report to be furnished to Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

(So I returned home two of the which objects were within view of my car. At home I went out to drive. Describing objects were then sighted constitution basis - star, did not appear to move or a 'doubt of them'.

I have made a good many statements to have bearing on this, some of which I will reiterate to Capt. Mack. I was asked to put these statements in my report. I will not. I will write them out tonight as I recall them. If the Air Force wants them they can pick them up.

These people want to hold and be received by our government. I am just an ordinary citizen, depending on the government of the United States of America to help in a situation which is beyond my authority. I am not getting that assistance.

No news media have as yet been contacted regarding this report.

No CASE INFO QMLY

Sir/Gentleman & the Sec.,

On the evening of Sept 16th 1966
I was driving westerly on US 63. Approx 5 miles
north of Bloomfield. I saw what looked like
an airplane. I could not see any outlines. I
came as I was about a 1/2 mile away and
appeared to be about the same height ago.
Now what makes it strange was
that the pulsating red lights appeared to
be 3 of them. And I saw no white or
great lights. It was travelling west to west.
Watched the flight for what would
seem to me to be about a 1/2 of a
circle, sort of the "pointed triangle" was in sight
about 3 or 4 minutes. This middle
it travelling very slow and it appeared
to be travelling fairly slow.

Said not hear any motor sound.

Not trying to jack flying saucers,
but writing this because I saw an article
to notify people of any flying object
that couldn't be positively identified, to tell
people about it.

Respectfully Yours

Memo for the record: 4 April 67

22 Dec 66 Dayton, Ohio stopped by to discuss a rock structure that was found in Merlin County, Ohio. The rock was found on 14 Sept 66, KW had seen a rock like this in the area. He said that there were several pieces around the area. There was no indication of any fire around the area.

Physical Specimen was sent to The Air Force Material for evaluation on 27 Jan 67. A spectrographic analysis of the material showed it to be alpha ferric oxide (Fe2O3). No apparent source or use for the material could be determined.

Note: See Physical Specimen dated 19 Sept 66.

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433

1. Reference enclosed letter:

a. I asked Mrs. [redacted] to write this for me because she wanted to call the President and other government officials.

b. As far as I know, she has sent a copy of this letter to the President and Senator Dirksen as stated on the last page of letter.

c. As you know, Amherst is only 10 miles from Niagara Falls, however the envelope read "Air Mail - Special Delivery - Registered, etc". After talking to Mrs. [redacted] for 3 hours, both Lt. Johnson and I agree that she is mentally disturbed. She is about thirty (30) years old and has five (5) children, the oldest one being nine (9). She was constantly complaining how loud they were and that the radio was on full blast all day. Her husband ignores her completely.

d. Objects sighted during our visit were stars and airplanes; however, Ira. [redacted] insists they are not stars but communications systems from the UFO's and also introduced me to them.

e. This morning, 30 September 66, she called me and said she was not afraid and that I could remove the spot-lights from the area. She would talk to the UFO's and take care of everything. The spot-lights she was referring to were located at new car dealers lots, arriving with the new 1967 car models.

f. Again I say, the only reason I am forwarding this is to let you know it has been looked into and if an inquiry does arrive, you have an answer.

Subject: Sightings of UFOs

During the last week of August, 1966, I, residing at [redacted] near, in the town of Amherst, New York, began circulating to check in the visible skyline west of my home to see if there were such things as unidentified flying objects. Although I did not, at first, keep a complete record of such sightings, the following record will indicate that said objects, to my knowledge, to exist, are visible to the sky, and some effort should be made by our government to establish contact with them.

Sept 1st 1966 UFO sighted moving across sky
Sept 3rd 1966 UFO sighted in sky moving
Sept 4th 1966 UFO sighted
Sept 7th 1966 Drove on east Erie County Saturday

Sheridan Drive, at 350 Sheridan Drive, Tonawanda, New York. A stationary object appeared in the sky west of my car while was in the parking lot. It hovered like a long thin width a blurb o

abr. No other show was visible at this time, which
was about 8:30 p.m.

Sept 9th 1966 Sighted digit west of house
Sept 10th and 11th Saturday night and Sunday morning
& first noticed the bright object west of my
home. Then I returned to my front porch and
observed the sky from 11:30 PM to 1:40 AM.

After 11:30 PM sighted seven moving objects,
high in the sky, as well as distant stars, to
the west of my home. These objects grouped
close together in erratic pattern, and moved
simultaneously to a position north of my
home, at 12:30 PM my neighbor's daughter
started to her home from an evening of
baby sitting. At this time I went outside
my home. By about 12:30 AM I went outside
and stood leaning against the porch railing
looking north at the sky. Within a few
moments an object began to move in
an easterly direction. About a minute
later, another object commenced to move
directly to the north. As I watched these
moving objects it suddenly fell on a slant
short and a set of magnetic pulling
sensation shot through my body.

I felt as if I were being paralyzed
& could hardly move to the South West and

now am obigt describing with fantastic
regularity directly toward me as if from
an enormous distance out in space. It
was blunt white in color and then seemed
to be flashing light to it.

I was terrified and with what was
an intense conscious effect of the will
grabbed for the handle of our storm door.
I leaped into the house and slammed the
inner door shut. I now directly returns to
my bedroom to overrun my husband to
tell him what had happened. I failed to a-
wake him fully but told him of the event
on Sunday morning. He was quite skeptical.

September 10th 1966. Being quite shaken by my
experience I did no observing that night.
Sept 12th 1966 In the evening, having determined
not to allow fear to prevail it went outside
to observe. Sighted two moving objects.
Sept 14th 1966. Went to a meeting at St. Fred's School

Eagleville, NY.

I parked in the parking lot about 8:30 P.M.
The sky was mostly obscured by clouds. I scanned
up and sighted 3 blunt objects high close my
head in the one open patch of sky.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

From this date on, September 14th 1966 such evening I have sighted a deep object well of my home in the sky, it appears as a brilliant white star, Twinkling. On occasion this object moves in erratic fashion, sometimes north, sometimes south. It also changes position or its distance from the earth.

Sept 15th Left home in auto about 745 PM. proceeded to Niagara Falls Blvd and their Dept store. Observed two whitish/white objects in sky. One was suspended high in the west above the treetops the other was high in the sky directly above my head. Entered store, made purchase at 8:30 PM. Did not believe object were stars - They were still in sky when I entered my auto, one directly overhead.

Turned into Niagara Falls Boulevard, drove north to north-west road in the town of Amherst, turned said into N. Trench Road and proceeded through Amherst into the town of Clarence, N.Y. Trench road as still with construction on Clarence rd of followed same detour signs until I again crossed N. trench Road at a point where the eastern and western sections were still closed to traffic this is a sparsely populated area. I stopped by the road having

Left the car lights of car on and got out. the night was bright and clear, with many stars in the sky. As I stood there, many white then blue objects gradually descended. None of jets were still high, just well below the bulk of the stars. These were electric wires crossing this intersection. These wires began to come up and down and emit a strong humming sound. The objects in the sky sent out in different sound hard to describe just like a microphone when it is out of order high pitched with pause, and then starting up again. Each object seemed to emit its own signal as it was quite noisy. Two cars passed by while I was there. When I saw headlights I set in my car until they passed. They did not stop.

After observing this phenomena for few and minutes I spoke aloud and said something like "My God, there is something up there! What do you want?" After observing for about fifteen minutes. Told, I got in my car and returned home.

Sept 16. I asked my husband to purchase a 60 power telescope. I was convinced.

the alight well of our town was not a star and
wished to observe it more clearly. telescope
was purchased, description follows.

Checked this out with a transit radio - turning it on. Turn off which weaving slept, some effect as if you are speaking. All the time you must be looking at the light.

Sept 18, 1966 Some sightings of sight in west through telescope.

Sept 19 Notified E B I. of UFO sightings, asked they turn all information on subject over to Air Force. Said they would notify Air Force say letter and would advise of my request for no publicity. Monday evening my husband and an associate Alfred Schaefer arrived about 10:45 PM. We sighted sight through thermos - as saw it as we left. Watched some sights descend and ascent. Husband and Mr Schaefer both claimed it was an optical illusion.

Sept 20, 1966 Completely cloud cover and rain - no sightings.

Sept 21, 1966 Called Air Force Base in Niagara Falls re sightings and descending sights. Was informed sighting and descent were possible optical illusion. Evening again - no sightings.
