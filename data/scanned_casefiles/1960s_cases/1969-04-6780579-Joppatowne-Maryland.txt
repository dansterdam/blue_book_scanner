TDPT (UFO)

UFO Observation, 22 April 1969

Joppatowne, Maryland 21085

1. A photo-analysis of your photograph revealed the following information:

"Examination of the negative submitted to Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla by the source, shows the image to probably be a photograph of the moon, made with poor optics. The photo was taken with a 620 box camera, which produced a negative with degraded imagery. The resolution level of the negative is too low to permit identification of the areas indicated by the source to be UFO's. The areal anomalies appearing on the imagery are most probably a combination of debris and reflections within the optical system; however, without further information on atmospheric and viewing conditions, it is impossible to attach any meaning or cause to these anomalies."

2. We regret that your negative was lost shortly after the photo analysis was made. We are returning your photo-print along with a Blue Book and some selected UFO case summaries.

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 69-108, submitted by Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla, requesting an analysis of a photograph purported to contain an unidentified Flying object, taken at Joppatowne, Maryland, 22 April 1969.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the negative submitted to Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla by the source, shows the image to probably be a photograph of the moon, made with poor optics. The photo was taken with a 620 box camera, which produced a negative with degraded imagery. The resolution level of the negative is too low to permit identification of the areas indicated by the source to be UFO's. The areal anomalies appearing on the imagery are most probably a combination of debris and reflections within the optical system, however, without further information on atmospheric and viewing conditions it is impossible to attach any meaning or cause to these anomalies.
