1. PURPOSE: This report is written to fulfill a request, Work Order Number 67-113, submitted by Major R. Quintanilla, Jr. TDTJFO, to determine the identity of the unidentified object in the attached photo.

2. ATTENTION: The object cannot be definitely identified. There is the possibility that a good to excellent print negative, such as a bubble in the developer, or a light reflection could reveal more information which cannot be gleaned from the paper print that have been made available.

Dear Major Quintinilla:

The enclosed photograph, containing what appears to be an "unidentified flying object," is hereby submitted for comparison with other such photographs in your files.

It was taken shortly before 10 A.M., Wednesday, June 14, 1967, near Landers, California, while the camera was pointed in a northeasterly direction. The camera (a Rollcicord) was set at f16 with a shutter speed of 1/250th of a second. A Kodak filter was used to slightly darken the sky so that the white dome of the building being photographed would stand out more clearly. The film, Kodak Plus-X, was developed in a solution marked commercial as XS30 for 12 minutes at a temperature of 70°F.

The building is constructed by an "Integratron" or "Time Machine" constructed by Dr. [redacted] of nearby Giant Rock. I am of the opinion that the [redacted] is an out-and-out fraud, and I had intended to use the photograph to illustrate a tongue-in-cheek magazine article about the "Time Machine" and the Giant Rock area. These earlier visits to the site had resulted in unsatisfactory photographs due to the position of the sun on incorrect exposure. All of these earlier visits had been made late in the afternoon; therefore, I had decided to see if I couldn't get better results during the fourth visit by taking the photographs in the morning.

When the enclosed photograph was taken, the camera was mounted on a tripod. I focused it, made the settings noted above, and then stood in front of it and took the side so that my shadow would protect the lens from the direct glare of the sun. At the moment I tripped the shutter by pushing a cable release, I was looking at the lens, not at the object being photographed. At no time did I actually see the apparent "unidentified flying object" in the photograph.

As soon as I inspected the film after its development, I noticed a donut-shaped object in the sky above the building's dome. It appeared to be an unwarranted sun-burned by a clear area. Naturally, the clear area appears as a black ring in the finished print.

My first reaction was to conclude that somehow the developer had failed to reach the spot and that the result was a flaw on the negative. Perhaps, I thought, that portion of the film had been touching another spot on the same roll as it lay coiled in the development tank. But no corresponding flaw appears anywhere else on the roll. Frankly, this is a 16 mm. Nikkor lens designed to hold one roll of 120 film.

Here are some other factors about the situation that seem strange to me:

(1) If the white spot is the result of lack of development, what is the explanation for the clear ring (clear on the negative, that is surrounding it)?

(2) Instead of being clearly defined around the edges, as might be expected of a spot caused by chemicals, this spot is fuzzy around the edges, as might be expected from a photograph of an object in motion.

(3) I have taken and developed thousands of pictures, and this is the first time I have seen anything like this on any of them. It is certainly an astounding coincidence that the one picture in which I do appear taken was flying saucings have been so often reported and that it appears, not superimposed on the building or on the ground, but in the sky, where one would expect to see a flying saucer.

I still think the "object" shown in this picture is the result of some accident during development, but because of the factors listed above I am submitting this print for your opinion and for inspection in your files. If you would like to see the negative as well, please let me know and I'll send it to you.

Sincerely,

Dear Major Quintinilla:

"The enclosed photograph, containing what appears to be an 'unidentified flying object,' is hereby submitted for comparison with other such photographs in your files.

It was taken shortly before 10 A.M., Wednesday, June 14, 1967, near Landers, California, while camera was pointed in a northeasterly direction. The camera (a Rolliecord) was set at f/16 with a shutter speed of 1/250th of a second. A K2 yellow filter was used to slightly darken the sky so that the white dome of the building would stand out more clearly. The film, Kodak Plus-X, was developed in a solution marked commercially as X330 for 12½ minutes at a temperature of 70°F.

The building is reputed to be an "Integratron" or "Time Machine" constructed by [REDACTED] of [REDACTED] Rock. I am of the opinion that [REDACTED] is an [ILLEGIBLE] and I had intended to use the photograph to illustrate a tongue-in-cheek magazine article about the "Time Machine" and the Giant Rock area. Three earlier visits to the site had resulted in unsatisfactory photographs due to the position of the sun causing incorrect exposure. All of these earlier visits had been made late in the afternoon; therefore, I had decided to see if I couldn't get better results during the Fourth visit by taking the photographs in the morning.

At no time did I actually see the apparent "unidentified flying object" in the photograph.

As soon as I inspected the film after its development, I noticed a donut-shaped object in the sky above the building's dome. It appeared to be an unobscured spot on the clear area. Naturally, the clear area appears as a black ring in the finished print.

My first reaction was to conclude that somehow the developer had failed to reach that spot and that possibly was a flaw on the negative. Perhaps, I thought, that portion of the film had been touching another spot on the same roll as it lay coiled in the development tank. But no corresponding flaw appears anywhere else on that roll. The black spot, ironically, is a 16 oz. Minor, designed to hold one roll of 120 film.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a dome-shaped building with a curved roof, surrounded by a chain-link fence. There is also an oval-shaped object in the top right corner of the image. The building seems to be located in an outdoor setting with some trees or vegetation visible in the background.

There is no legible text on this page. The image shows a black and white photograph of a dome-shaped building with a fence around it, and an oval-shaped object in the sky to the right of the building. The building appears to be in a desert or sparse landscape with some vegetation visible in the background.
