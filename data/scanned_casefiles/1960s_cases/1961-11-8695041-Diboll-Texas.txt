DATE: Nov 14, 1961

On the night of November 1, 1961 at approximately 8 P.M. CST at my home in Diboll, Texas, I received a telephone call from Dr. a neighbor, that he had observed a satellite and would I care to see it. At that time I went into the street in front of my home and Dr. pointed the object out to me. The object appeared to me to be the Echo Satellite; however, the direction of travel was not the same that I had previously observed Echo on several occasions the past several months.

After observing the object several minutes, it disappeared suddenly. The night was clear and numerous stars were in the sky and the object could be observed readily since it was brighter than the stars. I did not observe any other lights, such as the red and green, usually seen in connection with high flying aircraft.

RE: Unidentified flying object.

Dear Sirs:

This letter is to report a phenomenon observed on the night of November 1, 1951, at Diboll, Texas, at approximately 8:00 P. M. CST. What was thought to be a satellite, was seen in the western sky at an angle of 70 to 80 degrees. This was observed for several minutes traveling in a northerly direction.

Diboll, Texas, a neighbor was called to observe. The object would have been dismissed as a satellite, if when it was, in the northern sky at an angle of 45 degrees, it suddenly disappeared at 8:05 P. M. CST and was not seen again.

The object could not be distinguished from a star of 2nd degree magnitude except by it's motion.

Respectively submitted,

ZLH:bbb

On the evening of 1 Nov, 1961 at approximately 8PM CST in Diboll, Texas I returned from a house call. I looked overhead and noted 2 stars and realized that one was in motion. When first observed it was at an angle of approx 70° from the horizon in the western sky moving toward the north. Assuming that it was a satellite I asked my wife, children and a neighbor to observe it. We observed it moving steadily to the north when it was in the same location about 45° above the horizon, it suddenly disappeared. The time was then accurately 8:50 PM CST. The light was consistent with some flickering. It was moving with an even, regular motion. No red or green was seen with the light. It would have been dismissed as a satellite except for its sudden disappearance.
