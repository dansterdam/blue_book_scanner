PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 27 Jan 68 28/0102

2. LOCATION: 100 miles west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-4 seconds

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Air Visual

7. COURSE: NW

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Probable: Astro(bolide)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer sighted an object that a baseball bat, round on the nose and tapering at tail end. The object was glowing white on the nose and blue white on the tail. The object seemed to descend at about a 30 degree angle in a NW direction. Two glowing balls were each side of the object shortly after which the object disappeared. The observer turned on the airplanes radar but no echo was observed from the object.

Comments: The description of the object is consistent with that of a bolide. Fact that the planes radar did not paint the object further suggests this fact.
