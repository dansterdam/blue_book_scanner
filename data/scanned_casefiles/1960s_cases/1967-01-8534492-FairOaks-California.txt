10. CONCLUSION: Aircraft (with afterburner) Prob. Unk

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched a round shaped object that was brighter at the center. The object was primarily orange in color. The object appeared to explode, emitting sparks that fell toward the ground. The whole object disappeared by going dark, then reappeared briefly before going out of view, then obviously climbing in a northerly direction.

The description is consistent with that of an aircraft making such a touch and go, at the local airforce base. A check with NORAD tower and Base Operations personnel revealed no unusual sightings. To several objects were reflected on local NORAD radar facilities.

MEMO for the Record:   20 Jan 67

Contact was made with Vandenburg AFB, in regards to any missile activity that could have accounted for an alleged UFO observation. There was no missile activity from either Ft. Magu or the Vandenburg facility on or about 1815 hours local 13 Jan 67.

Contact was made with Bob McClean at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico in regards to any missile activity that could have been observed as a UFO. White Sands fires on the average of one rocket a day but these rockets only rise to about 50 miles and then eject a parachute. There are no artificial cloud releases from White Sands that Mr. McClean know about. Also the Navy launches are-see rockets from White Sands.
