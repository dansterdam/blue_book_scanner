Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

I attempt to deny a semi-professional to share any radio experience with the air because I realize the sonal... Because I came things unthinkable.

The first time I saw one of these more object my vision was filling for some strange reason, that the second time come the third time confirm that I was dreaming or any eyes feeling me awake I have a respect 2020 vision.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 20330

OFFICER OF THE SECRETARY

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This will reply to your letter of August 29, 1968, and the Department of Defense stated that you have reported a UFO sighting during the period of April 24, 1967 and 1968.

Unfortunately, your UFO sightings of 1967 and 1968 are not enough to permit a scientific evaluation. We have found that any previous investigation tend to become too vague to permit an accurate evaluation. Therefore, we cannot use your 1968 sighting, and mail it in the enclosed envelope, people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will take a further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please submit the details to the Air Force, as this will permit a more complete spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate evaluation.

On the other hand, you might be able to identify your sightings as the sightings of objects reported as UFOs. Send any additional material on this subject that you may have.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information

Bronx, New York 10459

Performing OCR on the text:

On the date of April 12, 1967, a strange object was seen to descend from the sky to within 350 feet of the ground near Riverdale, West Bronx, N.Y. The object was about 50 feet in diameter, described as a bright light or flame colored, giving off a bluish-white glow. It was silent in its descent and started an erratic flight back up. The object was first noticed at 9:15 P.M. and was observed for about 3 minutes. After it ascended out of sight, there was a sound resembling the roar of a jet passing overhead.

On the date of February 12, 1963, at 3:30 P.M. a similar object was sighted near the same location. This object was observed for about 5 minutes. It also made an erratic flight pattern and was followed by the sound of a jet. The witness, a housewife, was alone and lives in the area. There are no air bases or airports in the immediate vicinity. The witness appears to be reliable, and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the report.

The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration is a compass rose with labeled cardinal directions. The bottom illustration depicts a person standing on a road in a landscape with hills or mountains in the background. There is also a small sketch of an irregularly shaped object in the bottom right corner.

As an OCR system, the text I can extract from the document is:

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a form or report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY STOP AND RUN AWAY?
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?

DISAPPEAR

PERFECT ROUND

It appears to be a checklist of observed phenomena related to UFO sightings, with the witness indicating that the object "DISAPPEAR" and has a "PERFECT ROUND" shape.

Below the checklist, there is a handwritten note that says:

"I suppose it is to have some light on the subject, but this time, because the people seem to play the wrong thing."

And in response to the question "How did it finally disappear?", the witness has written:

"Just disappear of my sight up in the air."

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch depicting an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch shows an irregularly shaped object with what appears to be a tail or trail of some kind. The text below the sketch provides instructions to "DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE AND THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE THE LABEL OR DIRECTION OF THE MOTION, IF ANY. AND INDICATE THE APPROXIMATE SIZE OF THE OBJECT IN RELATION TO SOME KNOWN OBJECT OR DISTANCE."

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

This was of the most visual case on record. It was a classic-type saucer, of about 50-75 feet in diameter, and gave off a luminous glow, about 6-8 inches thick. The object was estimated to be about 8,000 feet away and moving at an estimated speed of 200-300 miles per hour. This was observed for about 5-10 minutes.
