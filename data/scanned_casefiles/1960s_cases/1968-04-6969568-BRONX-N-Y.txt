27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

I attempt to buy a semi professional telescope to share my radio experience with the astronomy because I noticed the flying tower exist, because I saw them unresolvable.

The first time I saw one of these rare object I think my eyes was failing me or may be an illusion in my vision, but the second time I pay attention and the third time confirm that I was not have a perfect 20-20 vision.

P/S
Pardon my errors
in my hand writing
thank.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This will reply to your letter of August 24, 1968, addressed to the Department of Defense, in which you stated that you have seen three unidentified flying objects (UFO's) during the past 21 years.

Unfortunately, your UFO sightings of 1947 and 1963 are not recent enough to permit a scientific evaluation. We have found that after 30 days, precise details tend to become too vague to permit an accurate analysis. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire on your 1968 sighting, and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

On the other hand, you might be able to identify your sightings by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material on this subject that we are sending you.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN

Wright, DC.

Dear Sirs: Just a few lines to solicit you, and the same time, I want to give you my report about a flying unknown object possible a flying saucer. I saw three of them in different dates and hours. In our flying machine with no aircraft built by man will beat that power and speed of these rare ships. Their the sky like the airplanes make. I noticed that these machine are powered by several electro magnetic turbines engine for that reason they no make noise when their travel in space. The city population is good from your office to let visitors and the people not get longer afraid.

As far I know these visitors pay a visit to us as a friendly our aircraft, they stop a distant when they meet a airplane in their records in files, sometime of one of our aircraft go after them. The flying machine fly a runaway and disappear. I noticed that these visitors want to be our friends.

Your truly,
