OCT 25 1967

Dear Mrs.

This replies to your telephone query to this office on October 23 regarding the unidentified flying objects you observed over southeast Washington the nights of October 21-22 and 22-23.

A check with Andrews Air Force Base reveals that the base was supporting a rather sizeable Army exercise on those two nights. Helicopters in formations of two were taking off every three minutes, and planes were taking off every five minutes throughout most of the two nights in question.

You may have seen lights from some of the aircraft being used in the exercise. The UFO Investigator at Andrews had no other reports of unidentified flying objects on either of the two nights in question.

Thank you for your interest in the Air Force project concerning unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES, Major, USAF
Acting Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division

TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE 1968

DENVER, COLORADO                                     31 October 1967

Evaluation should be changed to "Insufficient Information"--
besides this is another one witness case! Further, 117 was not returned.
Whole thing seems unreliable. eg. "10 feet diameter held at arm's
length!!!"

Finally, reported by a 20 yr. old lad. Gross lack of information
bits for the input.

32. 11 July 1967, Macon, Georgia.
Temporarily misplaced. Check to see whether this has any relation
to the sighting the previous day in Azalea, Mississippi.

The only Manchester, New Hampshire case I have is for a different
date.

34. 12 October 1967, Ocaloosa County, Florida.
Although this had four witnesses, the data are very poor. A
balloon is ruled out because of wind at all levels. Two objects,
one trailing the other, nighttime observation, went from the northern
to the southern horizon in three minutes. Anyone of three evaluations:
(1) insufficient data (2) probable aircraft (3) possible unknown.

Do not have in my files. Will do in Dayton.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

On the night of October 31st there were no unidentified

This being a large hub center for the airlines and for general aviation there were undoubtedly numerous aircraft in the
