9. PILOT REQUESTED DEBRIEFING UPON LANDING.

REMARKS: PILOT REPORTED SEEING A WHITE DOMED SHAPED CLOUD APPEAR ON THE HORIZON AHEAD OF HIM AND TO HIS LEFT (TO THE NORTHEAST). THE CLOUD APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 15 DEGREES WIDE AND ROSE TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON. THE CLOUD WAS WHITE AND APPEARED TO BE GLOWING. IT ROSE RAPIDLY IN THE AIR. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES THE TOP ARC OF THE CLOUD BROKE FREE OF THE HORIZON AND BECAME A WHITE ARC LIKE A RAINBOW RISING IN THE SKY FOLLOWED BY A THIN TAIL. BELOW THE TAIL WAS A WHITE GLOWING BALL WITH A FLASHING LIGHT IN THE CENTER. THE ARC, TAIL AND LIGHT ROSE TO ABOUT 50 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND ABOUT 2 O'CLOCK FROM THE PILOTS POSITION. AT THIS TIME THE ARC AND TAIL DISAPPEARED BUT THE FLASHING LIGHT CONTINUED TO THE SOUTWEST UNTIL IT PASSED BELOW THE HORIZON. PILOT STATED THAT DURATION OF SIGHTING WAS 15 MINUTES. PILOT STATED HE HAS SEEN THREE NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS AND THE DOME'S FIRST APPEARANCE GREATLY RESEMBLED THE FIRST MUSHROOM CLOUD OF SUCH EXPLOSIONS.

OBJECT COULD NOT BE EVALUATED LOCALLY. OBJECT DID NOT CORRELATE WITH KNOWN MISSILE TESTING BEING CONDUCTED IN THE AREA.
