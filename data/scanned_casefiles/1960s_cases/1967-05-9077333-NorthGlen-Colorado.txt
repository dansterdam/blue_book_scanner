It looked like a planet a big one bigger and brighter than any stars in the sky that I have ever seen. It was moving northwest when we saw it. I had just got out of my car and was walking up to the front door when I saw it. And went in and got my folks to look at it. Then I went and got my binoculars which are 7x50 power and took a good look at it. It was about 50% or more over the ground when we saw it. Looking at it - then it went over the moon - out of sight.
