10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Regal, size of pinhead, bright white. Traveled N-S, generally straight course during first four minutes would stop and go, so straight course was maintained. Faded, bright white, then disappeared. Appeared 30° N. Disappeared 10° S.

11. COMMENTS
Orbit of this sighting was probably an a/c. An a/c 8 miles high and appearing and disappearing at an angle reported by witness would have a ground speed of 375K IF reported times are correct. Two airspeed required to make good such a ground speed would be 400K. Description made by witness is not unlike appearance of lights of an a/c.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possible Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical

Evaluation of Source Reliability: UNKNOWN

Analysis and Conclusions: THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY AN AIRCRAFT. AN AIRCRAFT 8 MILES HIGH AND ASCENDING INTO DESCENDING AT THE ELEVATION ANGLES REPORTED BY THE WITNESS WOULD HAVE A GROUND SPEED TO 375 K. IF THE REPORTED TIMES ARE CORRECT. THE TRUE PASSED REDUCED TO MAKE GOOD SUCH A GROUND SPEED WOULD BE 400 KNOTS. THE DESCRIPTION MADE BY THE WITNESS IS NOT UNLIKE THE APPEARANCE OF THE COURSE OF AN AIRCRAFT. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY AN AIRCRAFT.
