11. COMMENTS
This was a strong return on the scope, which seemed to be a solid object moving erratically at varying altitudes between 1500 and 3000 ft.  The lights on the object were flashing irregularly.  The radar operator stated that this was not a normal target and that the lights and motion were unlike any known aircraft.  The object was observed both visually and on the radar scope for about 10 minutes.  The object finally faded from both visual and radar observation.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved line in the sky, labeled as the "horizon (skyline)" and instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on the curved line to indicate the object's position when first seen and when last seen. The second sketch shows a larger object with details on its shape and position in the sky. There are no human faces or identities visible in this image.
