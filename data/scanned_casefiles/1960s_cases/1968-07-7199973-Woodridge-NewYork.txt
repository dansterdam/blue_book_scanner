This image appears to be a map with various roads, intersections, and geographical boundaries. The map is divided into grid sections labeled A through E and numbered 6 through 10. The map shows numerous roads, towns, and regions, with "ULSTER" prominently visible in one section. The map is black and white, with thin lines representing roads and boundaries. Some town names are visible, but due to the image resolution, not all are clearly legible. The bottom portion of the map is obscured by a dark, blurry section.

UFO Observation, 7 July 1963

New York, New York 10009

1. Reference your unidentified observation of 7 July 1963, which you reported to the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Information, in Washington, D.C.

2. Our satellite records indicate that at 1:33 am, ET, 7 July 1963, ECHO II was at 59° latitude, 79° longitude. The satellite was at an altitude of 640 miles, traveling roughly from the north to the south, and may have been visible from your position (approximately 74°30' longitude, 40° 30' latitude). At 1:33 am, the satellite was at 44° 30' latitude, 71° longitude, 649 miles altitude and should have been visible from your position. Sometimes between 1:33 and 1:42 am, ECHO II passed the area of your sighting.

3. This means that at approximately 1:33 - 1:34 am, ECHO II should have been visible low on the horizon to your northwest. The satellite has a stellar magnitude of -1 and would have been brighter than most stars. The satellite would have continued to gain elevation and would suddenly have disappeared at about 1:40 am, almost directly overhead. Thus, ECHO II appears to be the stimulus for your sighting.

4. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
Aerospace Technologies Division
Production Directorate

This image appears to be a map with grid sections labeled A through E horizontally and 1 through 5 vertically. It shows a detailed road network with numerous roads and intersections, and various town and location names. Some visible location names include:

- Merwin
- Norton
- Cook Falls
- Rockland

The map seems to cover a region with multiple counties or districts, with roads interconnecting various towns and areas. The map is black and white and appears to be from an older document, with a slightly grainy or aged appearance.

SAF-OICC/Miss Turnure/76526/July 10, 1968

JUL 10 1968

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This will reply to your letter of July 7, 1968, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object or UFO.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each case in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting yourself by looking at the categories of objects, other reports on UFO's in the Project Blue Book report we are enclosing.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division

New York, New J
July 7, 1968

Dear Sirs;

It was very early Sunday, July 7, 1968, at 1:30 A.M., in Woodridge, New York, where I was spending my vacation. That is, myself, and several other people watched the Big Dipper seem to move. At first, it looked normal, but then the lower 4 stars that make up the pan turned (see diagram). The 2 stars beneath the handle were into a spinning motion, at turning a pencil from point to center and back to point. The 2 stars to the right of the 2 mentioned above, went round. The right and vanished.

The first part of what which I mentioned, tilted, after making one complete rotation, swung off and followed a pattern that of the upper, in that shape.


- page 15 -

It was clear, and the stars were shining. Observations were made by bare eyes and by binoculars. The process ended at 1:40 A.M., 10 minutes later.

I shall be happy to fill out the official forms. If possible, please send them to:

New York, N.Y. 10009

Hoping to hear from you soon.

Respectfully, yours

15. After the incident, The Big Dipper once more looked normal.

Here is the text from the document:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "O" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WHICH LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE REPRESENTING THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
