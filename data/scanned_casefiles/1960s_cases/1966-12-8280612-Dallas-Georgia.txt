Dear Sirs:

On November 2, 1966 at about 9:30 p.m. I saw a U.F.O. People were with me. They U.F.O. had a noise like a helicopter but it was round and had a silver grayish color. We watched it for 15 to 20 minutes. It was moving east. The U.F.O. was visible slowly until about 10:30 p.m. This was on December 8, 1966. The people with me who saw the U.F.O. were my wife and my two sons.

I am 13 years old and live alone with my parents.

P.S. I had a camera but by the time I got back it had disappeared. I've been trying.
