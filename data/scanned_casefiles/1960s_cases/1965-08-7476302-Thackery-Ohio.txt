35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This is a hand-written response that reads:

A o-what had not changed direction. I just how some point to be a satellite or a very high weather balloon. But having observed weather balloons I have never seen a balloons stop & the object did make an approx 90° turn (Rather it changed direction). The person that called me might that there had 4 come from the East 4 of these objects & that they had objects being or apparently to be much larger, one of the 3. This person further stated that when the objects were directly overhead the 3 smaller ones disappeared & the large one went directly north out of sight. The man's name is Robert Shafer and he lives in Thackery, Ohio & states that there were 3 people present & observed the object. I did not witness the 4 object myself.
