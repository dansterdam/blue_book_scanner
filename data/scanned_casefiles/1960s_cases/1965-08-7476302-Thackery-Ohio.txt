PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 15 August 65 16/0405/
2. LOCATION: Thackery, Ohio
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Visual
7. COURSE: West to North
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: The evidence indicates that the object was NOT A/C, but the duration this report represents a possible transient target has multiple factors considered.
The object appeared as a star close to it. It looked like a bright point. Changed brilliance and appeared to wand slowly. Conducted night fly for several minutes, turned to North. Appeared to stop when it changed directions. Moved a considerable distance at constant motion before disappearing. This report sufficiently clear to evaluate, although the stopping and changing directions and the fluctuated existence does not easily classify the object into a normal category. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that an A/C was the likely culprit.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
OBJECT BECAME DINNER FOR STARLINGS - LESS THAN 5 SECONDS THAN CAME BACK TO ORIGINAL INTENSITY.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes.   No.   Don't know.
If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:
It moved behind:_

If you answered YES, then tell what:
In front of:_

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: NO SOUND
b. Color: EXACTLY THE SAME AS A STAR

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
OBJECT WAS T SIZE THAN PLANET JUPITER. LARGEST STAR I HAVE SEEN. SO BRIGHT IT LOOKED BIGGER THAN JUPITER'S DISK.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please be accurate in your drawing to show the direction in which the object was moving.
THE OBJECT WAS TO HIGH TO DETERMINE ITS EXACT CONFIGURATION. IT WAS WING-LIKE. SOME PARTS OF IT DID LOOK LIKE WINGS. HOWEVER, IT IS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE OBJECT CAME FROM THE EAST AND THEN HEADED TO THE WEST THAN SEEMED TO RETURN TO THE EAST AND THEN MOVE TO THE NORTH AND DISAPPEARED TO DIRECTION.

The image does not contain any photographs, only illustrations and text. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically an interview or questionnaire response.

The text in the image is as follows:

24 AUG '65 MONTH YEAR
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire may be included in this space. The objects changed direction in an erratic manner and accelerated at a very high velocity. But during the interval time of 3 minutes the object remained stationary, and the direction of the object changed three times. The only feature which was observed was the changing direction of the object during the course of observation. The object did not cast any detectable shadow or exhaust and silently maneuvered in the sky. Come from the East movement & what they had was one 4 second observation & one 5 minute observation. The object was silvery white in color and no other distinguishing features were observed. Object of about 50 to 75 feet in diameter, round or slightly oval shape, making three separate maneuvers during the last 3 minutes of observation. The large one was visible only for a short time (about 5 seconds) the smaller one was seen for about 3 minutes.
