Dear Sir:

AT 5:45 PM EST, THE HEADQUARTERS QUALITY OF THE OFFICIAL COMMUNICATION, THROUGH A 20-YEAR OLD ACTIVITY CLIP, WAS TAKEN IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN, WITH OUR DAILY CLIP SHEETS. THE LIGHTS WERE SIGHTED IN THE TRIANGLE CASE DRAWING. NAVAL COLLEGE POINTS AND GRANDMOTHER OBSERVED THE SAME PHENOMENON, BUT WE WERE THE ONLY OFFICIAL DETERMINATION TO PLACE YELLOW, RED, AND WHITE. AT 6:20 TO 6:25 OF GLOW, VERY FAR SOUTH, APPROPRIATELY TO THE AREA. STILL THERE ARE SEVERAL SIGHTINGS RELATING STILL. THANK YOU FOR SENDING THE DATA. I HOPE AT LATER DATE TO CLARIFY THE QUESTION OF UFOS.

Sincerely yours,

Send 164

The only text I can clearly read on this page is "21,900 ft" written in the middle of the page. There is a simple hand-drawn diagram with circles and a line connecting them, but the text associated with the diagram is not legible. The page appears to be a lined notebook or report page with hole punches on the left side.

AUG 21 1967

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on February 7, 1967. Please excuse the delay in replying; however, because of our heavy workload, we are, at times, unable to answer as promptly as we would like to do.

Although we are unable to positively identify the object, we do believe that the planet Venus would have been responsible for the sighting. At that time, Venus would have been on an azimuth of 248 degrees at an elevation of approximately 11 degrees. With a stellar magnitude of approximately 3-4, at the time of your sighting, Venus would have been the brightest object in the sky, excluding the moon or course.

One reason for its unique appearance, when viewed through the scope, could be attributed to chromatic aberration. When white light is incident upon a lens, the red component of the light is farthest from the lens, while violet light is focused closest to the lens. This often causes the object to have a colored halo, thus giving the effect of lights of various colors.

We offer this hypothesis only as a possible explanation. Upper atmospheric turbulence often creates the illusion that an astronomical body is in actual motion.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
