34. Date you completed this questionnaire: _ Day _ Month _ Year
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
Saw something unusual in the sky which moved very fast and disappeared—was round and glowing—no sound and did not resemble any aircraft I've seen. I am quite sure it was not an aircraft like those I have seen in the area.

Dear Captain
This is to submit our report on ufo sightings in this area during the evening of February 21, 1967. At around 6:53 pm, we observed a peculiar object in the sky approximately 3 miles west of this town that appeared to be approximately 50 feet in diameter, round in shape, with a dark color and a dome-like structure on top. The object was observed for about 5 minutes by my wife and myself, as well as a neighbor, Mr. Watkins, who lives a few houses down the street. The object moved very slowly at first, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view to the north. It did not make any sound that we could detect. I am forwarding this report for your review and any further investigation you deem necessary. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Sincerely,
David Lacy

Based on the image, there does not appear to be any photograph present. The image shows a page from a Project Blue Book document, which contains text only.

Transcribed text from the document:

AUG 21 1957

This refers to your recent correspondence concerning your unidentified flying object (UFO) on February 21, 1957. Please excuse the delay in replying; however, because of our busy schedule, it is sometimes difficult to answer as promptly as we would like.

Although we are unable to positively identify the object, we do believe the details you could have been responsible for your sighting. At that time, Venus would have been on an almost 23 3/4 degree azimuth at an elevation of approximately 11 degrees, which would have coincided with your sighting. If it were Venus, it would have been the brightest object in the sky, scheduling the eclipsi ng of the brightest stars and planets.

One reason for its unique appearance when viewed through the telescope, according to astronomers, might be caused by the atmosphere, which tends to cause distortion. The violet light is refracted farther from the lens, while the red light is focused more, thus giving the object a colored halo.

This offer is only a possible explanation. Upper atmospheric conditions can sometimes affect the way objects are seen or actually motion.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

BARRETT R. YOUNG

Dear Major Quintilia,

In Feb.,1967, I sent a report of a UFO sighting (Feb.1,1967) to your office.In return, I received a FRSP from LC 14 w/envelope which I failed out to the best of my ability and returned. Since then, I have received no word as to what I viewed.If you have such information, would it be possible to send me said information?Thank you for any information you can send.

Sincerely yours,
