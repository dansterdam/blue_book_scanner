10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Witnessed object toward NW, quite low, displayed many colors and appeared to move very slowly toward it. Witnesses observed object with (750 binoculars) but were unable to determine shape. Disappeared by suddenly flashing out. Witnesses did not watch object continuously but returned to house for short periods between observations.

11. COMMENTS
Object was probably planet Venus. Planet was in a direction coincident with that reported by the witnesses and set at approx. same time as conclusion of sighting. Venus was of magnitude 3.3 at time of sighting. Venus is on opposite side of our Earth has a semi-diameter of only 9".58; therefore, it is understandable that witnesses were unable to determine shape through 7x50 binoculars. Cause of sighting: Identification of Venus.

12. CONCLUSIONS
