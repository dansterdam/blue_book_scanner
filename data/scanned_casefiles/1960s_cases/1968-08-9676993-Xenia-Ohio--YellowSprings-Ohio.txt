11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS An object, or light, shaped first like plate, then like sphere, open convertible going north. Interestingly, witness drove home and called some other witnesses to observe, but it was
gone by that time. Witness said the object was rising and should have been visible but apparenfly it had blotted out or moved away from that location. Reliable witness report hypothesis is based on their failure to see the object, even though they tried.

Based on the image provided, there does not appear to be any photograph or visual content. The image shows text from what seems to be a Project Blue Book report document.

Transcribing the text from the document:

Its appearance? And how? The color certainly sounds very much like the moon. Then Mr. identifies it as the moon. And as for the statement they they so emphatically used this motion to prove that it was definitely not the moon, yet they do not ever explain how they could definitely tell it was not the moon. Though they keep repeating that assertion. Again, I think that autokiness is involved here.
Then, I feel that Hynek makes a very serious error when he makes the assertion that it would go very clearly to the first part of your sighting couldn't possibly have been the moon. Why not? And even if the were convinced of that, by making this statement he further conditions the witnesses and bolsters what I think was their erroneous conclusions from the observations. She is the one who kept claiming that what she and her parents saw was definitely not the moon. Because "it was moving" which is again characteristic of autokinesis. Hynek should never have stepped in and backed their conclusion. He is supposed to be a neutral fact finder, trying to elicit the facts from them, and how he has backed into a corner something that she will always say that she saw something different from the moon, and the facts are different from what she is saying.
It seemed to me like an ordinary moon in the beginning. Then it kind of toggled and appeared to be swinging. They asked about sounds, which appears to be imagining and so does the "funny odor." 
In reply to Hynek's direct question about whether it "moved across the sky," they replied "it really actually appeared to move." I have to reach the conclusion that, the only reason for believing that it was not the moon is that "well, the moon never acted like that."

- page 2 -

The image does not contain any photographs. As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

"himself then described it as similar to a "pale full moon on a very misty foggy night." Hynek put the words into his mouth, like a "corona" discharge.

In brief, I am quite convinced that the object was probably the moon. That strong autokinesis was involved. That many of the motions reported were imagined.

As for interview, I think it was faulty procedure to interview all of the witnesses at the same time.

Hynek seems to make something of the fact that Mrs. Hynek says, it means absolutely nothing. He quotes what the other people said, He talks about "a light started to come back," and then describes what he certainly be very much like the moon coming through the clouds. He even mentions the "oval" character which would fit in with the phase of the moon at the time.

As you read through, you get the impression that people are answering for each other.

I am certainly not impressed about either the noise or the odor.

What Mrs. Hynek heard the noise when it was over her and close to her, didn't Hynek ask how excitable she is? And of course she replies 'I definitely am not any cool.' There is a definite point that seems to be there of always somewhat believed in, although until you actually see it there is always something saying 'I have always believed in,' although until you actually see it there is always something saying 'I have always believed in it, although until you see there' are such things.' To me it is clear that she is believing in flying saucers. This is always there in Hynek's statements. And this sort of a belief could have readily conditioned her when she saw and misidentified the condition.

Hynek gets briefly out of the time discrepancy, but I don't think he clarifies it at all. We get only the reply from somebody else. Hynek's assessment of the time, however, seems realistic from anybody else."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text on the page discusses an evaluation of the testimony of four individuals who claimed to have witnessed an unidentified object in the sky. The document discusses the reasoning behind the evaluation, including the possibility that the object could have been the moon, and the challenges in verifying such phenomena.

The text output is as follows:

reasonably consistent with the evaluation that it was the moon.

I cannot follow Hynek's reasoning that, as far as he could see, it was not the moon.

Hynek says "Unless we discount the testimony of all four." I don't see the testimony of all four, as they, despite her declaration to the contrary, was probably very excited and hysterical. Under such conditions, autolcinesis is common.

I have observed it myself. Moreover the phenomenon can be transmitted to another person.

In brief, I have heard so much over the years, about "stars cavoring over the sky," and the impossibility of explaining them, and the lack of understanding and appreciation of auto-kinetic effects, that I think the time has come to review such cases. Or, in the case of new cases involving "jerky motions," to recognize the auto-kinetic syndrome.

I see no stretching of the evidence whatever to identify this object as the moon. And if, by the qualification "given" Hynek means to distinguish between the actual testimony and possible conclusions drawn from testimony, then he is not properly "weighing" the reliability of humans witnessing such a phenomenon. I see no reason to assume that the "icasite horizon" was obscured," simply because "not one of the four saw the rising quarter moon." That is a complete misstatement. Everyone, including Ardene, testified that the object "looked like the moon." It was Ardene who insisted that it could not be the moon because of its apparent motion. And Hynek concludes by the statement, which seems to me completely unwarranted by the evidence, that "it seems unlikely that the four, particularly the engineering student, would not have recognized the moon over a previous at least five minutes."

The transcript speaks for itself. The engineering student described what he thought he saw as the moon. The only reason he doubted it, was because of the silence. And much the same response came from others. Moreover, I see no reason why, from the evidence itself, at least three of them reported that they were really seeing something that looked like the moon.

There is no photograph present in the provided image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing handwritten text. 

Here is the text from the document, transcribed using OCR:

"Finally, as for the statement about "keeping her cool", I refer to Lucy's statement that "when she came in she seemed to have started to death." And that is the impression I get from her actions.

To summarize my impression, there is absolutely nothing in this entire statement that leads me to suspect that something other than the moon was involved. Certainly no plasma phenomenon was necessary.

In my honest opinion, there is absolutely no reason to keep this sighting on the list of unknowns.

In defense of Hynek's position, however, I concur that the moon does not necessarily account for twenty degrees, nevertheless, what he said, that "it seemed to move slowly" to descend within about a few hundred feet, following her, she would have clearly overheated" so I do not think that Hynek's question to her husband, concerning Anderson's visibility, was responsible. 

I realize, too, that the moon and stars don't just hang around the way they are seen too many cases of both moving fog and astronautics to believe that is what happened at this same place. That was a single example, completely separate from other cases which may have some comparable similarity. On the other hand, I do not think it is not justified to use this point because I gather from some of Hynek's comments that the motion seems some distance from the local scene did arise from cases certainly unrelated phenomena. And that is something I have to consider on this point, because I gather from some of the comments that attention was given to some possible connection in this case that attracts him.

I don't. There are too many-far too many different stimuli that give rise to such phenomena. On a given night, from the same locality, reports of UFO's will arrive from widely scattered points. And this is something I have to consider."

that, apparently, no one other than myself has generally
realized or emphasized.

I think this case is about closed. It might be
relevant to get significant weather data from the local
weather bureau from, preferably from any nearby airport.
And I would certainly like to have a chance to interview
the concerned observers, especially if they believe in
their case, share it with any local or national
organization? What had she read about UFO's? These are
relevant considerations things.

2. Reference your letter of 15 July 1963. Please excuse the delay in replying.

3. We have reproduced a copy of the 29 February 1957 sighting from TPR: Parts Defects, for you. A copy of the file was sent to you on 6 November 1963, however, the attached case also includes material on this incident.

4. Enclosed is a copy of our evaluation card for a sighting from Galion AFS, Mansfield, Ohio, on 15 August 1963. Three of the four observers were airman controllers, and they all estimated that the "object" was sight to be an unconventional light.

5. We also have a very interesting case for the late evening of 19 August 1963. The encounter (apparently three very capable and reliable people) sighted a large triangular object that covered a considerable area and made a roaring noise. There was a strong inversion that night, and the observers could see the moon and stars, however, the moon should have been visible and in roughly the same position as the object. We would appreciate your comments on this case.

6. Incidentally, we do not know anything about the decay of any UFO sightings over a period encompassing in June and early July 1963. Apparently, this decay involves 23 films, for which polar patterns. Since it apparently involves 23 films, we wonder if you might be interested.

Dear Hector:

Thank you for all of the interesting data you sent. I had seen the brilliant article. I simply cannot understand Hynek. I could support the idea of an international UFO project only on the idea that it might take our project off the more serious worries of the world. Scientifically, the idea is of course nonsense. I have not seen the notice in the Electronic Laboratories for September 30. I agree with you. If I, too, am completely disgusted off the record, I would say that if I were in your shoes, I would terminate the contract. That contract is of no consequence to us.

While at the AIAA meetings in New York while the American Astronautical Society was holding its meetings, I was approached through a special panel, endeavoring to pass judgment on the Condon Report. This would be completely unacceptable and embarrassing. One knows in advance from the personnel involved what the answer will be. Incidentally, I was in New York while the American Astronautical Society was holding its meetings, and was surprised to hear of the UFO Travel Committee. I have no information, though, as to what transpired, because I was busy otherwise. I think your censure of 15 October is certainly deserved, but far too restrained.

I apologize for not having replied earlier to your letter of 10 October and its interesting enclosures. But I was busy myself on a project of the Interplanetary Astronomical Union, naming craters on the far side of the moon. Following that, I spent the week in Colorado.

I was very much interested in the Czechoslovakian report. It is almost certainly St. Elmo's fire as you surmised.

The text of the document is as follows:

Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla                 -2-                 October 28, 1968

With reference to the 25 February 1967 sighting at Fargo, N.D., I know what that was that the boy's saw. But the "object" seen on that date, as described by the witness, certainly the Planet Venus, as seen from "Sky and Telescope" for March, 1967. This concludes my statement in the eventsAs I said in the previous letter, for it was well after 11:00 pm when the sighting occurred, and therefore, the planet Venus would not have been a factor. 
I am not very much impressed with Hynek's investigation of the phenomenon. The major defects that I believe is a serious defect of many such investigations, that the two separate groups saw the same "object." Well, if it was the same object, then it was the Planet Venus, beyond question. The boys might have seen something different.
There are lots of questions that I could ask, which apparently were not touched on. I'd like to know what the model of the Polaroid camera they were using - Polaroid's have automatic controls for evaluating the exposure. But when one is taking the picture of a small object at night, control does not function properly and I would suspect that the pictures taken by the boys were not clear, because they are not, because of their irregularity. I think pictures should have been taken under similar circumstances, to check the significance of the scratches seen at the edge of the film. How can one minimize the effect of camera exposure? There was nothing in the record to indicate that the object photographed by the boys was under a plane. In such cases is interesting, but the investigation leaves much to be desired.
So, in regard to the present case of 14 August 1968. After reading the report, I am convinced they were seeing the moon. It has been my experience that when a person says, in effect, "the sighting resembled a UFO, but it could not have been a UFO, because..." then it almost always is not a UFO. This would not be the first time that people have called the moon a UFO. I think that many of the UFO investigations have failed because the investigators take the statements of the witnesses at their face value. Under such circumstances, I subscribe to the motto that "People are Dumb!"

I would also concur with the identification of the Eielson sighting of 11 July 1968 as a meteor.

I had some interesting discussions with M. Minnart, the Dutch astronomer who was the chief individual working with me in analyzing the far side of the moon. He is the author of a delightful book "The Nature of Light and Color in the Open Air." Are you familiar with it? He has some very interesting views on the nature of many phenomena of meteorological optics. There is an intensive discussion of phenomena in his book.

He told me that he had discovered a number of extremely reliable observations of unusual optical effects of the moon, which in terms of reflection go up to 3 1/2 degrees! There is no simple explanation for these phenomena, but he was quite sure that something peculiar in the way of meteorological optics is responsible.

Somewhat concerned about this situation, I have worked pretty hard, as you know, to get some sense into this area. I know of no other individual who has into the matter, with the possible exception of Hynek. But something definitely has happened to him and I don't know what it is. He now seems to regress the cases, not to progress them. Apparently he feels that "you must solve the entire problem." In a letter to Condon he states:
"I want to be of help to insiders like yourself, but I do prefer to keep files and dealing with cases solely on an individual basis if these facts can lead to social or political implications which could lead to a potentially dangerous Marsellian approach."

I don't think I could interpret it better.
But it shows his bias. I think each case has to be approached separately. For there are usually of different kinds of stimuli, we usually completely unrelated. Unless we understand completely what you can solve individually, we should not assume that the individual solutions he wrong, simply because they may not fit into a single picture, independent thinking. Frankly, I feel much of this represent ignorance.

But the remarkable approach to the subject, he, alone, must bear the blame. He, alone, must be held responsible.

With thanks and best wishes, I am

Sincerely yours,
Donald H. Menzel

I would also concur with the identification of the Eiselson sighting of 11 July 1968 as the moon.

I had some interesting discussions with M. Minnort, the Dutch astronomer, who was the chief individual working with me in analyzing astronomical aspects of the case, based upon his book, "The Nature of Light and Color in the Open Air." Are you familiar with it? If not, you certainly should be, because it discusses many phenomena of meteorological optics. There is an inexpensive 1984 edition, if you desire to get one.

He told me that he had discovered a number of extremely reliable observations of multiple images of the sun or moon, which in terms of reflection go up to 3/4 degrees! There is no simple explanation for these phenomena, but he was quite sure that something peculiar in the way of meteorological optics is responsible.

Sometimes I get discouraged at the situation. I have worked pretty hard, as you know, to get some sense into this area. I know of no other scientists that have into the matter, with the possible exception of Hynek. But something definitely has happened, not as individuals, but as part of a broad pattern. Apparently he feels you must solve the entire problem. In a letter to Gordon he states, "Hynek and staff, in keeping his and dealing with cases solely on an individual basis, as were the clear that each case, taken singly, like a lone duck in a shooting gallery can nearly always be shot down by an ad hoc, frequently Manichaean approach."

I don't mind his reference to me in this fashion. In fact I consider it something of a compliment. But it shows his bias. I think each case has its own difficulties of different kinds of stimuli, usually completely unrelated. To some isounds complex nonsense to say that you can solve individual cases, but you cannot solve them if you take them in a group. But why should my individual solutions be wrong, simply because they may not correspond to data in another, independent sighting. Frankly, I feel much of our present ignorance, of UFO's must be laid that to Hynek's own step, with his imaginative approach to the subject. He, also, must bear the blame for the fact that Air Force questionnaire is so bad.

With thanks and best wishes, I am

Cordially yours,

However, I expect that either on a future trip to Dayton, or independently, I will have occasion to be in Cincinnati at which time I would like very much to interview the witnesses in person. I am not satisfied with the lack of details in their report as described in the descriptive material. The vagueness persists after my personal interview, I would like to change the evaluation from "unidentified" to "insufficient report" but at the moment I do not have sufficient cause to do this.

September 22, 1968

For the Record: Summary of the sighting of August 15, 1968, Yellow Springs, Ohio.

Mrs. X have just finished talking with Mr. and Mr. and Mr. and it took nearly an hour to get the details. It is all on tape and has been transcribed, but a synopsis of the case follows:

With the car moving down when she came home from Xenia, Ohio, driving a convertible overhead. I quizzed her on this at length, but couldn't shake her story that it was oval-shaped, seemed to glow, and she didn't know how high it was - so give her a credit point or two for honesty on that. The oval part of the object screamed down the road in front of them, seemed three miles from home but covered the distance in just a few minutes. She was frightened, and her first impression was that it was the moon, escape I considered however that it was a student at Gincinnati, reading a book at the time upstairs and didn't come down at once, until he got interested and the then went out but saw nothing, not even the moon. He stayed outside for ten minutes and the glow came back, and moved around, but not much attituding the housewives against the branches of a tree. The object or glow was not overhead but about 30 or so degrees above the eastern horizon - it said, like a full moon shining through not definitely the moon itself.

There is disagreement on the time, but they should have seen the moon unless there was a bank of clouds in the eastern sky, which happen more frequently than not. But unless they are sure that the moon was down, I would put it into the "Plasma" category if I absolutely had to.

There also was disagreement on the sound, but they agreed on the odor, which was the usual sterile character. One said that he was not conscious of any sound. 

On the basis of the evidence given, particularly as to the angular elevation in the sky, the eastward motion when it did move away, and the misty appearance - it would suggest insufficient information for a definitive evaluation, or "unidentified". To identify it as the moon or some other normal funily of the weighing five it is a fact that not only I but four saw the rising quarter moon at the time but did see stars, causing me to think that the eastern horizon may have been obscured. It seems unlikely to me that all four, particularly the engineering student, would not have recognized the moon.

Transcript of:
UFO Sighting of 15 August 1968, Yellow Springs, Ohio. (Fogg)

Hynek: In one of my recent visits to Wright-Patterson AFB, I came across your sighting of August 15, 1968, and I am quite interested in it, and would like to ask a few questions about the general circumstances that were not covered in the report. How many of you were there actually at the time of the sighting?

Mrs. ___: It was a sort of varied. A wife was first on the scene, then she came in the house and I guess she probably got a glimpse of the object and then my parents went outside some time I came downstairs a little later. So there were actually four people that I know of that saw it at the time.

Hynek: I've found from past experience that, and I've been making observations for a good many years, that the best way to do this is to just ask you to sort of recount the crime, so to speak. Could we all take a deep breath and start in from the beginning. There are a few things I didn't have straight in the report. First of all what sort of a night was it?

Mrs. ___: It was dark. There was no moon, but it was clear.

Hynek: You could see the stars?

Mrs. ___: You could see the stars but no moon. You could mistake the object for the moon doesn't do that kind of performance.

Hynek: What sort of performance did it do? Another thing, there was some inconsistency in the time. One person says 12:45 to 1:30, and another person said 12:30 to 1:00 AM.

Mrs. ___: The one that I have down on mine I know is definitely correct. I looked at the clock when I came in.

Hynek: What was the time on yours?

Mrs. ___: I'll have to look at the report. I filled it out two days after I saw it. I remember it said 12:30 AM. That's what I had down, not whatever else had been around.

Hynek: You say you occupied quite accurately the time of moonrise. The moon was at a certain stage I believed in this area. Now that means that by 12:30 you should have seen the moon and this other object. The reason I ask is that perhaps what you folks saw was the moon, but what I find difficult to figure out is how it could have had some motion that you describe.

Arden: Well, first of all about the moon - I really can't remember if there was a moon or not. I believe there wasn't, but I know there is more to it than was a moon or not. I believe the thing was more to it than what I describe.

Hynek: Let's forget the moon for the moment and think more in terms of the actual actions: where were you as the time and where you coming home from?

I was coming home from Xenia and I was on _________Road.

Yes. I definitely spotted it somewhat over my car but I really was not aware that it seemed to be following the car. I was more aware of what it was doing beside the car. It seemed to follow the car about 12 feet up ahead. It seemed stationary. I thought this it's that far above why is it just following my lights.

Hynek: When you say up above, where was it in the sky?

It seemed like it could have been maybe 300 feet above my car, but I can't know. The angle was straight above and it looked like a solid disc and it had a movement.

Hynek: You say straight above. You mean part way or really straight above?

Just about straight above as it seemed to be following the lights. Because when I turned out the lights and I went ahead of it it was still stationary there. I left the car with the lights on & it remained there and then came to look for me - and then it seemed to all of a sudden get smaller and it went over to the back of the farm and I saw it there and it left a small and it had somewhat a noise to it. Mr._____said the small was like that of the German planes of World War II.

Hynek: I'd like to get more of the description of the actual object, and let the person make clear in their own words of what it seemed like to them. What would you choose to put up there that would most closely resemble what you saw?

Well, I would say most likely when it's directly overhead, a plate - a plate that was moving very rapidly because this had that glint of something glow around it.

Hynek: When you say it was spinning, what movement? Do you mean it was spinning?
Witness: Have you seen these little toys that gyrate - this was the type of spinning. Also once it seemed to have banked and it looked like a quarter turning with the center being on top. It looked like a top, in a way, but I couldn't say it was able to stay in one spot or shoot up directly, quickly, or back and forth.
Hynek: Did it ever pass between you and something?
Witness: No.
Hynek: Did it ever pass in back of something?
Witness: Yes - no, not really. I was the one that was moving at the time. I moved on the way past the tree and that was the only time.
Hynek: I'd like to ask you to do this, with your hand point as though you are pointing your finger at somebody with your arm outstretched, when you first say it, how high would you have to have pointed to it?
Witness: All the way up because it was straight up.
Hynek: You mean when you first saw it, it was straight up?
Witness: When I first saw it, it was straight up and then after that - I don't know, it was written out because first of all I didn't know how serious you people took your lighting, and I might say 2 or 200 angels maybe. It was directly overhead and then later on it was sort of like you.
Hynek: How did it disappear?
Witness: To me it just seemed to have gotten smaller.
Hynek: This whole thing lasted about how long?
Witness: I would say half hour, off and on.
Hynek: I can understand why you wouldn't be looking for the moon at this time, being frightened by this. But do you recall what direction you were coming back from Xenia - trees or hills?
Witness: It was very dark that night because you just couldn't miss it.
Hynek: But I mean in the daytime how does the east look? Does it look ----
Witness: I would say lighter and the sky above, of course, is like everywhere else.
Hynek: What I'm trying to get at is how much of a horizon - can you see clear.

Text from the document:

Where the land meets the sky, or are there trees in the way?
There are some trees.

What color was the object?
I would say a white and gold and yellow. Those are the colors it had during that time.

And now how bright - can you compare the brightness with something?
It was maybe the brightness of a mercury vapor.

How far away - a mercury vapor a block away or two or three blocks away?
I would say maybe two blocks away, maybe more. This was when it was white. When it was yellow and gold it was more of a softer color...it wasn't very bright, enough so that you could tell, but it seemed to go into a quarter.

Did it have any effect on your car in anyway?
No, not that I noticed.

Did you have your radio on at the time?
I don't believe I did.

What did it appear to be doing? You say following your car, but what did it do that followed your car and not something else?
First thing I noticed - the road all of a sudden looked so light and everything else was somewhat dark and I wondered what it was. I happened to glance up. I don't know where it came from, when it started, it just was there and the reason I stopped it was because when I would leave the car and I got out and started running toward the house, it seemed to be staying with me. But when I got in the house it seemed to be moving along with me.

You were in a car that had a top on it. I expect.
It was a convertible and the top was down.

What model car is it, by the way?
It's a '67 Sunbeam Alpine.

So that you were driving with the top down?

All of a sudden it was there.
I was traveling north on . . . . . Road.
You were traveling north and you think the thing came up from behind?
Well, it's only logical explanation I have because I didn't notice it until all of a sudden.
As a girl all by myself, I was somewhat scared because first of all I never could be believer in UFO's, not really, and I didn't want to be taken to some population as quickly as possible.
So you never stopped the car. You just kept on going.
I stopped the car periodically because I got the idea that this was following my lights, so I got out of the car and I started running toward the farm, and I noticed it was stationary.
Well, it depends on how large the object is. I'm just guessing - I don't even know - maybe 300, maybe a little larger.
I should have asked really how apparently large was it. That is if you had held say, an aspiring tablet or arm's length, it will just cover the moon. Now if you had taken a dime, it would hold it out and estimate how much of the object it would have covered at arm's length.
As the time it was directly over, maybe 1/50 of it. (As the time she felt it was closest). When it shot off into the distance, it went about 1/4 to 1/2.
So much of the sky did it seem to block out? You know how large the full moon appears in the sky?
Definitely at the first sighting of it it was larger than that. I do want to say that when it was overhead it did seem to have a fog or a mist or something around it, the center part being stationary and the outer part having a rotating motion.
Were there any other cars on the road?
No. I was the only one that I could see.
You were about how far from home at the time?

- page 20 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

I would say maybe about three miles.
Were there other houses and things like that around?
No.

Now let me ask you to describe your actions as you stated - you said at one time you got out and ran to a farmhouse, and then what happened.
First of all, I remained calm. I knew exactly what was going on, but I could tell it seemed to me, that I was involving the lights. And I really didn't know what to do, so I left the car with the lights on and started heading on up his house (it). And then it seemed to me that the lights were coming on up and heading toward the house again and it seemed to be moving, always being overhead so this is how I got the idea it was moving along. And I just ran into the house to get other people, and all of a sudden it got smaller directly overhead and they quickly shor out to the horizon.

In which direction to the horizon?
East.

Now how long at that time you should have seen the moon there because the moon was there in the east. How long after it first happened was it until you talked to somebody?
Immediately. Because as I was coming into the house - they were seeing it move over that way and it was something that went off again and on again periodically.

Who was the first one to see it after you?
Mr. - . My father-in-law, - .

Who are the relationships there?
Gerald, the husband and - , husband's father.

When you first came in - please try to describe when you got to the house, what did you do? Did you hang on the door, or did you walk in?
I just walked on in. I would come out here for a minute, there's a flying saucer. They can out and didn't seem astonished. They said that's the moon - don't worry - and then I was satisfied. Then we watched it some more and you could truly tell that it was not the moon and you could truly tell it was definitely a saucer.

When you then came out was it still overhead?
No.

Transcribed text:

It was heading out that way when I came out and they just saw, glancing at it, they'd say, that could have been the moon, but it definitely kept on its movement.

How low to the horizon did it get when Mr. [redacted].....

I think it was still pretty high up. It was not down, it was over that it was...[say we're looking at the tree--it was at least 12 feet above the trees all the time. But then it was moving to the left and to the right.

When that sort of motion went on--if you had a ruler in front of you held out at arm's length, can you describe the number of inches it would have moved right or left or up and down. 

It would move almost a foot. And then it went up and then it seemed to disappear for a while, but it came back again, and it came back again, and then it started going--it was definitely only one object, not two. Movement such as this, and changing shapes and colors that rapidly definitely was not the moon.

Let me get the shape of it. You said it looked like a cut of a pie?

Yes, a quarter piece of pie at one instance. It looked like a round saucer, maybe the bottom part of it, and then it seemed to take a dip or turn and all of a sudden it looked like a quarter piece of pie.

I don't remember whether in your report you drew a picture of it.

Now that you know, as you put it, that someone is taking it seriously, I'm wondering whether you would be kind enough to redraw that from memory and give us a few more notations of directions, and shapes?

Now just with paper and pencil, toward the middle, toward the top you put a dot. Now just make it round from one point to the other, except this is a large hunt which is going with that. What as it looked like this it was a yellow-gold.

How long did it take you to get home from the time you first saw it?

I wouldn't say any more than a few minutes.

How long altogether did the other people see it?

All of them saw it the same amount of time. I saw it just a few minutes more traveling time.

CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS 02138

CABLE ADDRESS "OBSERVATORY"        AREA CODE 617 864 7600

November 12, 1968

Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, Jr. USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
HQ, Foreign Technology Division (AFSC)
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio 45433

Dear Colonel:

In case you have not seen it, I enclose a xerox copy of page 30 from the Flying Saucer Review, September/October 1968. I am honored to have my name so closely linked with yours. This is a criticism from an author that renders it somewhat the opposite of Lt. Col. Quintanilla's intent, I am afraid.

I have only one minor point to add to my previous discussion of the Yellow Springs case. The odor was said to be something like that of a gasoline or other petroleum product. What about engine's car? I think that the question of odor could have been disposed of quickly, by a few apt questions.

One further point. The map shows some turns of the road. But it does not disclose whether the road was absolutely straight or whether it may have been winding. In the apparent maneuvers of the UFO, this would have been a significant fact, had it been determined.

Incidentally, what other sort of answer could Hynek have expected from his investigation, rather than a classification of Faith, since the witnesses allegedly had such close contact with the object, and saw it so frequently? He should have drawn some sort of answer then. The answer might have been very different.

- page 23 -

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this scanned document page. The document contains text only, which I will transcribe as follows:

Hynek: Do you think there is any possibility that what you saw and what the others saw was different?

That is a possibility, but I doubt it because it seemed to have been of the same type of motion to it. It truly did, although it wasn't in the same spot as I came in. I came in the house and we went outside, but it was the same sort of personal... 

Hynek: I was wondering about when Mr. Fogg came out and said "Oh, that's the moon"?

At first glance they were laughing, but then they watched it for a couple more seconds and then said, "Hey, it's moving". As you watched it more, it seemed itself to be definitely not the moon. When you first glance you see a light in the sky and when you see it like that it looked like the moon, but then as you see it actually moving and changing color the way it did, and the small which it left, you could definitely tell it was not the moon.

Hynek: The calculation shows that the moon came up at 11:36 and an hour from then it would have been about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon, and almost directly in the east, and it would have looked like a quarter of a pie.

I'd feel better myself if it had been the moon, but to be truthful I notice it mainly because my eyes were just looking directly at that without your glasses away.

Hynek: Well, certainly, I would say that the first part of your sighting couldn't possibly have been the moon.

That definitely was not the moon, but then what my in-laws and I saw I'm pretty sure was definitely the real thing because I would not have been attracted to it. But something that I did see did attract me and it frightened me although I remained calm, and it was exactly as I told you just the same sort of movement. Like when I was coming into the house, it seemed to sort of personality and movement, although it was not in the same spot as before I came into the house. I'd be willing to get together...

Hynek: I'll be in Dayton again. I get there about once every month and a half.

Hynekness: I'm ready to go back down to the campus in Yellow Springs this week.

Hynek: There is a possibility that I will be in Cincinnati on Oct 9. May I have your address?

Hynek: When I get to Cincinnati I will look you up because I would like to get a little more information on this. Also, I mean to be utterly blunt about that. I want to see what sort of person you are. I mean just how excitable you are.
Hynek: I definitely keep my cool. You never get the full facts over the phone and something like this is interesting, but it is very truthful. I've always believed it is a deliberate thing will probably see it there is always something of a doubt. It's only logical that there are such things.
Hynek: And how before we get off the line here, the first person you spoke to was Mr. and Mrs. and I'd like to talk now briefly with someone who came out of the car and called them, and I'd like to clear up the discrepancy in the time.
Hynek: I remember looking at the clock and I remember it lasted about a half hour. I saw it longer than the others did because I was on the road.
Hynek: The others all seem to say it was before midnight - you had it after midnight. (To Deputy Folks) They would say enough to just describe what you saw from the time that Ardene came in and called you outside.
Hynek: It just looked to me like an ordinary object in the beginning. Then I looked at it and it was in one spot - then pretty soon it kind of hovered and then it gradually moved on toward the east. That would be backward travel or an ordinary moon to start with.
Hynek: It certainly would be. Now where was it in the sky when you first saw it?
Hynek: I would say it was kind of in a southeast situation.
Hynek: As what angular elevation up - that is, how high would you have to point?
Hynek: I couldn't say how high, because you wouldn't know how big the object was.
Hynek: I don't mean how high it was in feet, but I mean how far did you have to lift up in degrees.
Hynek: About 45° at the most.
Hynek: I'm rather surprised that the moon wasn't seen also, because it rose at 11:36 the night, however, they may have been clouds around the eastern horizon.
Hynek: I didn't see the moon at all, not even after this thing disappeared.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a written transcript of a conversation.

The text in the document is as follows:

Hynek: That must mean that either it had clouded up or that this occurred earlier than you thought. If it occurred before midnight then you probably wouldn't have seen the moon because it takes a little time to rise. If you had to put something up in the sky by magic, so to speak, what thing would you choose to put up there that would most closely resemble it?

: I don't know.

Hynek: Something like a Christmas tree ornament or a flashlight bulb - just something common - what would you put up there that would most closely resemble the shape and all that?

: Well, the shape just looked like a flat light, just like the moon would look, but it was sort of a reddish orange. 

Hynek: Well, if it's anything like a familiar object, how many degrees did it move from the time that you first saw it 'till the time that it disappeared?

: Let's see, I would say it would swing pretty close to 20°.

Hynek: What are the possibilities that the thing could have been a helicopter or something like that with a bright light on it?

: No, because if you could see anything like that, you could have heard some engine noise.

Hynek: Well, there were noises, but it sounded like - in the report it was described as sort of a groaning sound.

: Well, that was one that we had seen back about 11 years ago.

Hynek: Describe the noise, the sound, of this one.

: I didn't hear too much of a noise.

Ardene heard the noise when it was over her and close to her.

: I didn't hear too much of a noise on this one.

: We smelled a funny odor.

Hynek: For about how long?

: I would say about 20 minutes after the thing disappeared.

: It got lighter as it would disappear and come back.

Hynek: When it disappeared and came back, how did you judge that - did it simply get brighter and change or simply move across the sky?

Transcript:

It really actually appeared to move.
Hynek: Appeared to move crossways? 
It had a movement that no moon ever had. This was what attracted us and made us watch it.
Hynek: Well, the moon was never very high at that time, certainly, quite low in the horizon and if you say it fizzed up, well then obviously couldn't have been the moon.
I really studied it. But at first glance, I got there just a man who had turned to look at us in rather a peculiar way. But then we saw it doing this.
Well, the moon never acted like that. Then we watched it and it was doing this movement.
Hynek: Can you recall some of the conversation you had during the time you were actually watching it? What did you say to each other?
That's kind of hard to remember. 
Hynek: Is Mr. Harold Fogg there - is he the one that works at Wright Field - could I talk with him - that is your feeling about this whole thing (to ______)
I don't believe what I saw and then what was explained to me by the other people. I really don't believe that there is a system of any sort that can operate, at least that I know of, with this kind of capacity. What else is there?
Major, I just wanted to get your viewpoint on this since you're - what is your field?
I'm majoring in aerospace engineering, and it's a field I've worked in. I analyze structures which does some design work on existing systems and I've worked in propulsion and I've worked in advanced design.
Hynek: How would you then, in more technical terms, describe the kinematics of this object as you saw it?
As I say, which was very vague compared to everyone else, I really couldn't give you any more than what they had explained to you; I could only use their terminology. 
Hynek: You mean by the time you got out there, it was mostly gone?

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report related to Project Blue Book, discussing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

Text extracted from the document:

Well, what happened - I was upstairs reading a book and then I heard the car come down the lane and I heard my wife come in and say something to everybody and everyone was talking and I guess they went outside. I stayed up there and was reading a while longer and I noticed that no one had come back in, so I went out and saw everybody had gone. Everyone told me what happened.

I was looking at that particular direction and then later on - I'd say maybe 8 or 10 minutes after it started - it started to come back. And then it sort of grew - I like to see that closer in intensity. Before it was sort of an odd shape and it sort of took the shape of an oval or sphere. It just sort of seemed to grow for a while, with a little pulsation.

Hynek: Compared to a very bright star, how would you compare it?

I wouldn't compare it to a star. It was much bigger than a star. It would look to me, after it had grown to its size, a pale full moon on a very misty, foggy night. Sort of a halo effect around it.

Hynek: Sort of like a coronal discharge?

The whole object seemed to have what I thought - I guess everyone else got a much closer look that I did. It couldn't say it was like looking at the sun, but there was no fog this time. It was hazy. The night wasn't hazy, the object was hazy.

Hynek: I'm still puzzled by the fact that since the American Nautical Almanac doesn't list it, and I'm an astronomer and I'd know how to figure out the time of the moon and everything, and it doesn't seem to be the moon. What I'm puzzled about is that nobody saw it. It would have been low in the east and only a quarter moon and it's a little surprising that no one saw it. Of course, there may have been so often there are, low clouds toward the eastern horizon which might have obscured it.

I debated about it being the moon, but it didn't seem to have, from where I was looking - there were a few scattered clouds. It wasn't like a heavy overcast or anything. Just a few narrow, band type clouds. But I didn't notice very many. Now I just think that if it was the moon, you would expect to see a lot more cloud cover. It didn't seem to have any particular cloud type over motion when the car was going by.

The motion - were they quite uniform? Did it accelerate or decelerate or what - or what motions did it discontinuous motions?

It seemed to me to be a uniform motion. I started to see a slow motion and then it seemed to get bigger and more intense and then it started to take a shape rather than just sort of a corner of some sphere, out to a round shape, a circular shape. Now using a fence post and another sort of - on the ground, it seemed to move, just very slightly, very slowly to one side, and back again to the original position.

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The text appears to be a transcript of a conversation discussing a reported UFO sighting. The conversation mentions that the witness, a woman named Lucy, saw something strange outside and reported it to the authorities, but they did not believe her. The transcript also mentions that the witness was asked to fill out a form to report the incident.

The text found in the document is as follows:

It's general position. And then it sort of stayed there a while and then took just about the opposite motion - it lost its intensity and sort of went back to the same shape that it had before, sort of a blob and then it got smaller. I didn't see it go any more than 10 minutes.
Hynek: That is certainly very interesting. It's not unique. There have been other cases like it. There have been many, many cases reported of bright lights appearing, as you say, like that. So you don't need to feel that she is entirely unique in this.
Lucy: I would believe her. I would how no question about it.
Hynek: What I mean to ask is how did you happen to make the report this time?
Hynek: We were asked to.
Hynek: By whom?
Hynek: The names and addresses on the form, they requested who else had seen it.
Hynek: What I should have asked is - how did the Air Force get it in the first place - Did anyone report it to the police or something?
Hynek: I've seen that report. I have a copy of my letter here - it was written the 27th of August - and I was a little surprised when the form came. I didn't fill them out right away because we were busy doing some other things. Finally, I thought I'd better get busy.

Hynek: We're always interested in cases which have several witnesses and people are quite clearly and obviously respectable citizens. So I just with that Ardene had had experience with her in the car. Alright then for now, and I hope that if I do get to Cincinnati I'll see Harold and Ardene there and talk more with them.

This phone number in Cincinnati is xxxxxxxxxx.

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201

Sept. 22, 1968

FOR THE RECORD: THE CASE OF AUG. 15, 1968

I have just finished talking with ___ and Mr. and Mrs. ___ all of Yellow Springs. It took nearly an hour to get all the details, and I have it all on tape, but a synopsis of the case is simply this:

___ was coming home from a Xenia, Ohio, driving a convertible with the tops down, when she became aware of a bright light directly overhead. It puzzled her at first but then she decided it was not the moon, as it looked too small. She could not identify it as the moon, and it caused her some anxiety, so she mentioned it to her husband, who was driving. He then also noticed the light and, according to their story, it was the size of a basketball and was bright white. They said that it seemed to be oscillating up and down and back and forth.

As they approached Yellow Springs, the light followed them and went directly over their car. Their story is that it gave off a point or two of light near the center and seemed to be spinning. The central part seemed to be blinding. She was some three miles from home but covered the distance in a little under ten minutes. However, her husband said that the light kept up with the car and was really not that far above them.

When they got nearer to home, the light suddenly disappeared, but they said that just before it did, there seemed to be a sudden dimming of the light, rather like the blinking of a light. Two did, and their first impression was that it was the moon, except that it was so bright and so close that it seemed definitely not to be the moon.

A student at the Fenn in populations systems etc. was passing by in the area at the time and saw the light. He said that he thought at first it was an aircraft but when he looked closer he could not identify it as such. He realized that they were not staying on a straight course but were maneuvering in a way that an aircraft could not do. He said that he watched it for some minutes but then it just disappeared from sight. The object or glow was now low on the horizon. It was, he said, like a full moon shining through a mist and definitely not like an aircraft. Later on that evening, there was a bank of clouds in the eastern sky, which happens quite often in that area. But unless we discount the testimony of all four, and would put down their story as fantasy, we would have to conclude that an object of some kind passed over their car and was seen by at least one other observer. The central part seemed to be blinding, and Mrs. ___ said that she was not conscious of any sound. The angular elevation in the sky, the eastward motion when it did move away, and the steady maintenance of object when it did seem to disappear behind the clouds, all tend to identify it as the moon. Is stretching the evidence, and by harrantied. The fact that not one of the four saw the rising quarter moon horizon may have been obscured. It seems unlikely to me that all four, who hardly agreed on the details, would have been deceived as to the identity of the object. One thing is certain - the central part seemed to be blinding, and this was noticed by all.

The image appears to contain two diagrams. The first diagram is a compass-like diagram with various directional labels. This diagram is likely used to indicate the direction of the observed phenomenon. The second diagram appears to show two landscape views, one larger and one smaller, depicting some kind of observed phenomenon or event.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

Mr. Massa, of the Columbus dispatch, has called me a couple of times in the last few days. He wishes to write a story based on our paper published in the House Hearings. So, perhaps it will have some good after all, since the reporter seems to be very sensible. I understand that it was to have appeared in the Columbus Dispatch Sunday, November 19.

Dear Hector:

I enclose herewith an all-too-lengthy evaluation of the Yellow Springs case. I have labeled it, to show in detail, where, how, and why, I differ in my conclusions from those of Hynek. You are at liberty to send him a copy and I enclose an extra copy for you, in case you wish to do so.

It occurs to me that you are fairly near Yellow Springs. Why don't you give the photo taken at the phone booth a casual going-over? She has it, and it might shed light following leading, or for both? Do you wear bi-focals, tri-focals, contact lenses? Were you wishing your glasses on the evening? Does your driver's license specify that you should wear these glasses? (This is a question designed to show whether or not she might be lying as to whether she had them on or not). Can she give you the correction she has? Her statement is the most important. But you might even find out about the other three, if convenient. Actually, I think it is hardly worth it, but I would be willing to bet that she has some rational limitation of vision trouble. Another thing to ascertain would be when she had her glasses last corrected.

I would, by all means, take this sighting off of the list of "unknowns." I don't think you've got enough unknowns on your list already, a 90% - and I would make this 99% - identifiable. Why not simply take "sighting" of hers and let the cases that you have closed up - one of them, I recall, is the so-called "dogfight" case of Oct. 1, 1948 at Roanoke, N.D. and my analysis of it in our book is, beyond all question, correct. Yet Hynek has substantially restricted, simply because he has never conceded the ability of stars near the horizon to give the illusion of a "dog fight." By the same token, he has never been happy, apparently, about such phenomena as sundogs and associated apparitions. It would be interesting for you to make a quick foray to check on those last three items, if you have the time. Please give my regards to Hynek.

Sincerely yours,
(Signed) Leo Dondero

I'd like to know how many of the cases that I have listed as solved in the "World of Flying Saucers," are still listed as "unknowns" in your files. If you would let me know, I'd like to re-examine the data and see if we can't get rid of a few more.

Finally, I enclose herewith a UFO sighting of my own, which leaves some uncertainties. I send it, just in case a material object was involved that might have been reported by someone else. I think that my analysis, however, is probably correct. I shall keep watching for a repetition.

Cordially yours,

Dear Hector:

Thank you very much for your letter of November 29. I am indeed glad that you agree with my evaluation of the Hynek case. I simply cannot see how in the world Hynek could have concluded otherwise. 

I would completely agree further with your statement that there is no such thing as a reliable human observer. Not even myself! I consider it something of an honor to have my name turned into an adjective - And I am pleased that you recognize the validity of the Menzelian approach. There are a few items of my philosophy which you have probably absorbed from our correspondence, but which I do not think that I have previously stated clearly. 

First of all, I feel that each case has to be treated completely separately. Even in the event of half a dozen sightings from the same night from the same area, the chances are quite high that each case observer will have seen something entirely different. And, to try to relate them and put them into a single pattern renders this why I do not go for the concept of "pattern approach."

In the early days - and even now - far too many of the Air Force sightings are listed as "unknowns." First of all, there should have been a special category implying "incomplete or faulty data." For most of the true unknowns cannot be solved because of that defect. And I still think that the Air Force questionnaire, though improved by the suggestions of mine that they did not accept, is still incomplete.

Lt. Colonel, Hector Quintanilla -2-   December 4, 1968

Very faulty. Frankly, if this office is to be continued in the Air Force, I think they should re-examine my recommendations, which were not made lightly, and completely revise again the questionnaire. And I would be glad to work along with you, sharpening up some of my questions, and answering objections that may very well be legitimate to my earlier suggestions. And it wouldn't cost the Air Force a cent. 

Besides, perhaps it is necessary. I would like to pay another visit to Wright-Patterson and spend a couple of days working with you and talking about the problems. Perhaps the Air Force has a direct flight from Random Field to Wright Field. 

One other thing concerning my philosophy. I think the Air Force has been much too conservative in their evaluations of reports. They keep on the list of unknowns until it is solved beyond all shadow of doubt. The well-known Hynek case is an excellent example. He keeps on the list of unsolved, with his combined conservatism and lack of imagination, refuses to accept the explanation I advanced in "The World of Flying Saucers." I think there is absolutely no question of this particular case. And I feel frustrated that the Air Force still apparently identifies it either as an "inexplicable balloon" or "unknown."

By the way, what is the exact status? I think that the balloon was perhaps an initial stimuli, but the plasma familiar with undoubtedly the force of the "dog fight."

I feel that, just as soon as one can suggest a reasonable natural solution, all is to be classified and taken off the books. Otherwise, the cranks and the believers will still keep it on as a probable UFO from outer space. Moreover, they will say that the Air Force believes that these phenomena are from outer space. 

Yes, I noted with some satisfaction the defeat of Congressman---. 

I don't know that you have seen my Martians, clearly inhabitants of the UFOs. I am sending a few of them to you. I hope you and your wife enjoy them. With the Seasons Greetings, I am

REPORT OF ANALYSIS OF THE CASE OF
August 15, 1968, YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO

by
Donald H. Menzel

I am not the least bit happy with either the interview or with Hynek's evaluation. In the first place, the time of moon rise, given by Hynek, is approximately correct. These are, I take it, all Eastern Daylight Time.

I have nearly always found that when some observer says "It looked like X," but it couldn't have been, because X, "the reasons for the 'because' are usually invalid."

Now for specifics. Hynek says that there was an inconsistency in the time, a moment to approximately an hour. This would have been worth while following up, but he does not go to the origin of the discrepancy. Who was the second person, and did Ardene really remember correctly? Did

Green item starts talking about "the man and this other object." Apparently he is already conditioned to the belief that a second object was involved, because his whole questioning appears to be predicated on this hypothesis. Apparently the reason that he questions the lunar identification is his inability to understand how the object could have had the reported motion.

There were two reported motions, one a spinning or rotatory effect and the second a following or chasing the moon. With reference to the second, as one is driving along, seeing the moon apparently following him. I remember, as a child, getting this sensation when I was traveling in a train or an automobile.

This case clearly exemplifies one of my major criticisms of the Air Force Questionnaire. I mentioned this more than a year ago when I sent in my suggested revisions. I want to know what the conditions are of Ardene's eyes. Is she myopic? Does she wear glasses ordinarily?

OCR output:

Did she have them on at the time? What is the nature of her correction?
I think this is extremely important, although I know that the Air Force has sometimes taken the view that such questions "invade the privacy of the individual," which to me is absolute nonsense if you are going to investigate matters of this sort. If you don't ask the important questions, you might as well just shut up and go to bed.

She says this person's report sounds like the moon to me, except for her report of emotions. With this light cloud or fog, I could not focus very well to what she said. She had no idea of the exact distance. She became confused and frightened. Even if it may have been only 30° or so above the horizon, was in itself an indication of an impression of nearness, which I give very little weight.

The concept of the moon following a car is extremely clear. When she stopped the car, she noticed that it was stationary. This again is characteristic of this optical illusion. And her estimation of distance, 300 feet (?), though just a guess, is again characteristic of estimates of distance when one cannot get a real parallel, consistent with the moon. Again, with her insistence on station, I think this could easily have been an optical illusion. I cannot understand why Hynek did not make some inquiries about her eyes. I don't even know whether the was wearing glasses or not. Some of her description of the appearance strongly suggests a defect of some sort.

She comes now, some ten months after that she had seen a "flying saucer" and she says that "you could truly tell that it was not the object and you could truly tell that it was definitely a saucer." There is no question here, as to how she was able to make this distinction? Hynek seems impressed that this object was not the moon and so he is agreeing with the girl. The description of the object seems to be rough some haze. Moreover, she does not indicate, nor does the rest of a set of sketches, any indication of its motion. He seems to be a flat disk rotating around the center. And that was what she said and cannot, something like a plate, Now she changes her impression and says that it looked like a quarter of a pie. Why didn't Hynek question her on this point? When, for example, did it change?
