1. We are reviewing sightings of unidentified flying objects for 1963 and have arrived at no definite conclusion for your sighting of 2 January 1963.

2. Would you please complete the attached form and return it in envelope provided. Particular attention should be given to movement of the object. The main discrepancy in the report concerns the movement of the object over the horizon. The weather ceiling indicated a ceiling of zero, visibility 5/8 of a mile, with fog and a light drizzle. The time of the weather report was 1200Z and your sighting about one hour later. Your comments as to visibility at the time of the sighting would be appreciated.

H. REMARKS: LIEUTENANT LAMBERT, AT THE SITE, RECALLED SEEING A
SIMILAR PHENOMENON ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO, BUT DID NOT REPORT IT AT THE
TIME. AIRMAN NEWMAN SAID HE THOUGHT ITMIGHT BE A BURNING AIRPLANE,
WHICH WAS WHY HE HAD REPORTED IT, BUT NONE SUCH HAS BEEN REPORTED.
THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION THAT THE UNDERSIGNED CAN THINK OF IS
THAT IT WAS THE REFLECTION OF A COLORED SEARCHLIGHT OFF THE FOG.
LIEUTENANT LAMBERT'S SIGHTING WAS MADE IN NOVEMBER 1961 ON A CLEAR
MORNING, ABOUT DAWN, HOWEVER.
