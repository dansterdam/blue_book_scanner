1. This replies to your undated letter, postmarked January 15, 1969. We appreciated learning of your unusual experience or April 4, 1967, and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date it would be impossible to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that a witness report his observation as soon as possible, thus enabling Air Force analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation.

2. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force,

Dear Sirs:

I wish to have information on any late U.F.O. reports. I wish to report a U.F.O. sighting. It was on April 4, 1962. The reason I withheld this information is because I couldn't find your address.
