UFO Information
Bunkerhill Air Force Base
Peru, Indiana

Dear Sirs:

On January 3, 1966, we called the Base reporting a UFO sighting. Again we are reporting two more sightings. We have delayed in these reports since there has been so much controversy over this subject.

January 9, 1966 - Sunday Evening - sighted between 7:30-
7:45 P.M. Southwest countryside Sheridan, Indiana. It was soon completely dark. It was very clear. The night was clear, few stars, bright moonlight. Appeared as a light brighter than the stars, with process of light (rays). At 7:30 (about) still on ground, moved rapidly, seemed to whirl. We noticed search lights came on in the south, northwest and east. Again was near these radio towers the way Sheridan. Hovered at approximately 30 degree angle, changed brightness, shape somewhat, disappear and reappear, speed up and much away.
