"On the evening of August 3 1961 we were sitting in the backyard in Kentland, Indiana, with a normal telescope, we had been watching planets and Saturns. We were looking from the west and casting the 1207 passage of Echo I satellite. The system of west, August was other than August 25 degrees in close the horizon. It was moving in an east west fairly direction, and appeared to me moving at about the speed of a plane. We were interested though that it was not a plane or satellite or other known flying object. This was at 9:15 in the west. It seemed to move at a very slow rate..."

Dear Sir:

I am writing to report the sighting of a UFO by myself and a friend of mine. The following report is as accurate as our short observation of the object will permit.

On the evening of August 3, 1961 we were sitting in the back yard, in Kentland, Indiana, with a small telescope. We had been watching Jupiter and Saturn. We were leaning back in our chairs looking for meteors and perhaps the 1207 passage of a "John" satellite. The object in question caught our attention about 1:5 degrees above the horizon. It was moving in an east-northeast direction and seemed to be moving at about the speed of a plane.

We both immediately thought that it was a comet; it had a bright nucleus and a wide fan of light behind it, as a comet. Immediately I got the telescope (10x), and I succeeded just before it reached the zenith. It was then that I realized that it was not a comet. It appeared to have a system of lights on it and then a sound from it was heard. I sat it with this telescope and my companion continued to watch it. We saw that it became very bright as it passed overhead. When it had passed the zenith, perhaps the strangest thing of all occurred; the direction of the tail of the changed. It had been in the opposite direction of the object's movement; now it was directly in the zenith and then a car. When the object had disappeared, I checked my watch: 11:33 PM CDT.

I have spent many hours observing the stars and planets with my telescope, and since Kentland is on an airline out of Chicago, I have observed many similar at night. I know what they look like. It is because this object was so much out of the ordinary that I feel compelled to report it.

I would be very interested and would appreciate very much any information you might find concerning this object.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
Kentland, Indiana

This is a small sketch of the object sighted.

It looked very much like a comet with an unusually wide tail.
