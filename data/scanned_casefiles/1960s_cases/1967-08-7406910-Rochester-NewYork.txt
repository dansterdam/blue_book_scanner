AUGUST 21, 1967

DEAR SIR,

(1) WHILE I WAS COMING (OR COMING) HOME FROM DURLAND EASTMAN PARK ON AUGUST 26, 1967 I SAW A OB-
JECT COMING FROM THE NW. DIRECTION. IT WAS ROUND, WHITE AND SOUNDLESS. IT WAS GOING ENE, FOR ABOUT
WEST SEEMED LIKE THRE OR FOUR MILES WHEN IT TURNED AND WENT NORTH. THEN WENT NORTHWEST AND IT
KEPT THAT COURSE UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT.

THIS IS NO. 1 SIGHTING. THERE'S A TOTAL OF FI-
VS 8 SIGHTING IN ALL PER WS 48-26-67.

(2) ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE NO. 1
SIGHTING I SAW A ANOTHER OBJECT COME-
ING FROM THE SOUTHEAST GOING NORTHWEST. IT WENT
IN THIS DIRECTION ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE AS THE
ONE IN SIGHTING 1 THEN TURNED WAND WENT WEST. THE
DRIVER SLOWED SPEED AS A CAR WOULD DO IF THE DRIVER
PUT HIS OR HER LEFT FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND RIGHT
FOOT ON THE GAS PEDDLE. THEN THE DRIVER WOULD
PUSH THE GAS PEDDLE TO THE FLOOR THEN HIT THE BRAKE*
AFTER A SECOND OR TWO MAYBE A MINUTE HESITATION.
THEN IT TURNED AND WENT NORTHWEST. THIS IS THE DIS-
TANCE I KNOW IT WAS ABOUT A 90 DEGREE TURN AND WE-
VE IT EAST AND DISAPPEARED.

(3) THESE WERE TWO OBJECTS. THEY WERE
ABOUT SEVERAL CITY BLOCKS APART.

I DRAW (ITEM 1) A STRAIGHT
LINE (DOTTED) SHOWING COURSE OF OBJECT AS I OBSERVED
IT FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST WHILE ITS COURSE WESTERLY
