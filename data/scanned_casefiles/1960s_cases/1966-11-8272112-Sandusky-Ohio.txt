11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched three flashing lights in the sky for over an hour. These objects appeared to be stationary. However after observing them for an extended time, observers noticed that the objects changed their position slightly, and although they were stationary, they continuously gave off flashing lights.

The description is consistent with that of astronomical objects. The bright stars, Rigel, and Sirius would have been in the area of the sighting and would have given a quite similar appearance.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Thank you for your report of the unidentified flying object that you observed in November 1966. Although a scientific investigation would be impossible to conduct at this time, your report will be retained as part of our data base.

If you are fortunate enough to sight another unidentified flying object, please contact the nearest Air Force base immediately. It is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

Plains
New York
August 22, 1967

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
Dayton
Ohio

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In the current September, Mechanix-Illustrated, I read with interest the story about Project Blue Book and your interview.

I am Asst. Chief Engineer of Radio Station WFAS, WFAS-FM located three miles due West of White Plains, New York. The station sits atop a high plateau, and from this vantage point, observation is excellent.

Last November I came on duty, at 6 PM, 1800 hours, on a Sunday, Temperature was below freezing. Wind was light. Sky was starlit. No Moon. Around 7:30 PM, the Chief Engineer arrived in the station parking lot, which is adjacent our 150 foot tower, with its red flashing beacons. He called to me to hurry outside to observe a UFO, which I did. I gazed upward and there was this rectangular thing, elliptical along its long flight in a Northerly direction. It was lit up in a serie blueish light, almost ghostly. The lights did not pulsate, remained steady.

As it glided Northward, I could not hear any sound from it, much as I strained to hear, only the rustle of Wind thru the bare trees. I followed it until it became invisible. It followed a straight path without veering in any way. The shape was very clearly defined against the sky, and I etched it into my mind.

The sequence of events happened this way. As the Chief parked his car, and alighted, he saw this very bright beam, bearing down upon him from the sky, as it approached from the South. Thinking it was a plane from our local airport he didn't give it much thought until it was directly overhead. At this point realizing it was not a plane, he called to me to come outside and observe this UFO, which I did. Of course by the time I got out of the building, a minute went by, and the overhead object was now going away from us, and the beam was extinguished, but the secondary lights, around the perifery were on. We both stared in disbelief at this vision as it slowly receded from us to disappear into the night. As for size, I would say the average matchbook or observer at a distance of ten feet away would be close. Months later another story about UFO's Fact or Fiction was published in M-1, along with eyewitnesses sketches. The one I saw was included down to the last detail, except this witness said that the central part of the "old fashioned kite shape" glowed with a pulsating light, mine did not, just blue-black or the sky it was gliding through.

In summing up, what we saw was definitely not a plane, or temperature inversion, or plasma, or gas, or an illusion, nor was it a flying saucer design. I hope this report is of some value. I would be glad to elaborate on any further questions. Enclosed is a sketch of what I saw.

Yours very truly,

S920J
ZANESVILLE, OHIO, FEB. 6, (JP)--BARBERS REPUTEDLY SAW A LOT, BUT
BARBER RALPH DITTER HAD BEEN KEEPING UNDER HIS HAT TO SOME EXTENT
HIS TALE OF SEEING A FLYING SAUCER THAT LOOKED LIKE A HAT.

UNITED NEWS,
DITTER SAID, WHO SITS WAITS IN A MAIN STREET SHOP HERE, DID ENOUGH
TALKING ABOUT WHAT HIS WIFE SAID PHOTOGRAPHED LAST NOV. 13
THAT A FLYING SAUCER WHIZZED AROUND HIS SHOP, SO DR. BENJAMIN GILLETTE, A ZANESVILLE PHYSICIAN, GOT WIND OF IT

DR. GILLETTE IS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
FOR AERIAL PHENOMENA, A PRIVATE GROUP THAT PUTS CREDENCE IN THE
IDEA FLYING SAUCERS ARE REAL AND MAYBE FROM OUTER SPACE.

DITTER SHOWED THE DOCTOR HIS POLAROID PICTURES OF THE "OBJECT"
APPARENTLY HOVERING OVER HIS HOME AT NEARBY ROSEVILLE. COPIES WENT ON
TO THE COMMITTEE, WHOSE EVALUATION HAS NOW BEEN REPORTED.

THE FILM MADE ITS WAY TODAY TO THE NEWSPAPER HERE, THE ZANESVILLE
TIMES-RECORDER.

THE NEWSPAPER STAFF ENLARGED A PRINT MADE FROM THE FILM AND ON
"INTERPRETERN DECIDED, "IT LOOKS LIKE A PLUG HAT--EVEN HAS WHAT
LOOKS LIKE A HATBAND ON IT."

DITTER DESCRIBED THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, THOUGH, AS ABOUT
20 FEET ACROSS, HE SAID IT HOVERED 25-50 FEET ABOVE HIS HOUSE FOR A
FEW SECONDS, THEN SAILED AWAY.

A159CO
HE SAID HE TOOK THREE PHOTOGRAPHS, ONE WHILE IT HOVERED, ONE AS IT
MOVED OUT OF SIGHT, AND ONE THAT CAME OUT UNDEREXPOSED.

HE SAID HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER TO COME OUTSIDE AND
LOOK WHILE IT WAS THERE BUT THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM AND DIDN'T COME
OUT.

THEY DON'T BELIEVE HIM YET, HE SAID.

AFRAID OTHERS WOULD FIGURE HIM FOR A "KOOK" OR A
SPOOFER, HE SAID, DITTER KEPT PRETTY QUIET FOR NEARLY THREE MONTHS.
NOW THAT IT'S, IN THE OPEN, HOWEVER, DITTER RELATES THAT THE UFO
APPEARED DISC-LIKE, ROTATING COUNTERCLOCKWISE, WAS SILENT AND HAD NO
EFFECTS ON THE GROUND BENEATH.

Space Tourists
By A. de Nicol

Put me on record as believing in flying saucers. Responsible persons have been reporting UFOs for several years now. Some of them have been close enough to a saucer to make out the words HAND DECORATED on the bottom.

The only question remaining is: Why have these things been hovering over the earth for so long? Why are they trying to find a parking space and are becoming more and more irritated.

We should lose no time in setting aside an open space, roughly circular, posted as COURTESY TOURIST (OUTER SPACE) PARKING ONLY.

We have got off to a very bad start with the arrivals from another world by ascribing them to match saucers. The trouble is, every time a saucer finds a nice quiet spot on which to set down, it is sighted by a nervous couple, the woman of which screams for Thursday night police. In short order the area is swarming with banshee-wailing vehicles flashing red lights and disgorging uniformed paranoids who know that nothing in the job depends on refusing to admit that they have witnessed anything more than a dog belching.

If we are not to create a galactic review of atrocities, we simply must create a better climate of reception for UFOs.

If you, for instance, dear reader, should happen to be the one to behold a saucer humming towards you, try to act gracious. Don't stare. Go on with what you are doing, in the open field.

Be like the fellow on television who, finding the camera on him, says, "Why! Helio there!" Then if they hit you with a beam well at least have tried these, at their case.

What's in Sky: UFO, Way We Go

We're not saying it is and we're not saying it isn't, but Zanesville, Ohio, barber Ralph Ditter made available to news media these two photographs that he had taken of what he described as a flying saucer buzzing homes at treetop level. Ditter, an amateur astronomer, took the photographs with a Polaroid camera using an exposure of 1/125th of a second at f/16. Officials to whom Ditter showed his unusual evidence described him as rational and intelligent.

Real And Reel?

Above, a picture that Ralph Ditter, Zanesville, Ohio, hunter, snapped of a flying saucer from near his home with a Polaroid camera. The picture is a copy of the original. At the right, Columbus, Ohio, Dispatch photographers also saw the saucer business with these two pictures taken in Columbus. Nothing was "doctored" with the negatives or the prints—except that the object in the left of the two pictures is the lid of a can of teletype newsprint taken as it was called from a window. The object on the left is the lid of a can which contained photo developer, with a lot of tape added for decoration.

Here is the text from the document:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location.

31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One) Yes No
31.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One) Yes No
31.2 Please list their names and addresses:

My wife, Sandusky, Ohio

32. Please give the following information about yourself:
NAME
ADDRESS
TELEPHONE NUMBER AGE 33 SEX Male

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent.
I'm a Registered Pharmacist and a private pilot my vision is excellent.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? Wright Patterson

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    10    1    67
                                                     Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Those objects appeared from the sky, however most after observing them for some minutes we noticed that the objects changed their position slightly, and although they were stationary they continually gave off flashing lights. The other person named and myself observed the objects approximately one hour, then we all returned to our homes. After minutes later I tried to locate the objects again and found that all three of them had disappeared.

I obviously can't tell you of the speed of their departure, but I will say they definitely were not star or planet, any form of aircraft etc.
