January 13, 1966

Dear Major:

This is to report to you the result of my visit to Holloman Air Force Base at Alamogordo, New Mexico, and on my visit to Deming, New Mexico to interview Mr. and Mrs. 0 who made a report from Deming, New Mexico on 22 September 1965, on a sighting which is currently classified as "unidentified". I was authorized to make the Holloman trip but the Deming, New Mexico trip occurred to me after I got to New Mexico. It turned out that I had to go later than I had hoped while I was there in order to interview the two witnesses concerned. I informed you of my intention to visit Deming by phone from New Mexico, as you will remember.

DEAR ROGER, 

This is the second part of my report on my trip to New Mexico.

On the day after I visited Holloman Air Force Base, I drove to Roswell, New Mexico, which is about 125 miles south of Alamogordo, where the Air Force Base is located. I had driven in this area on September 18, 1962, and photographs, which were made at Roswell, New Mexico, were said to have been taken of objects in the sky that same day. These photographs, which have attained some notoriety, purportedly showed sighting of unidentified flying objects. I was anxious to interview the people involved and to try to ascertain the facts in this matter.

Dr. and Mrs. XXXXX operate the La Fonda restaurant in Roswell. Apparently they do fairly well, and appear to be questioned frequently by curious visitors to Roswell who are interested in the "flying saucer" incidents which were alleged to have occurred in that area. They told me that on July 4, 1947, some ranchers had brought in some rather strange debris, which they claimed had fallen on their property. They stated that the ranchers had notified the Roswell Army Air Field of this, and that the military had promptly sent out a detail to pick up the material. The ranchers showed them a rather large area where a great many pieces of this unusual wreckage were strewn about.

Both he and his wife were quite reluctant to discuss the details of that particular incident. They did state, however, that this was the subject of much notoriety at the time, and that it resulted in a good deal of publicity and interest on the part of the public. They indicated that much of this was "blown out of proportion."

They had been coming north on U.S.85 from Douglas and had just gotten past the small town of Rodeo and gulls when they noticed something peculiarly hovered like something they had never seen before. It was round and white and appeared to be about this 3 o'clock position where they first spotted it. It seemed to be hovering above the ground and then it went extremely fast and vanished into the clouds and it was pitch black. Their first impression was this was some kind of new aircraft they had not seen before. They said at about their 3 o'clock position what appeared to be a solid object which was hovering above the ground. After it made this quick movement into the clouds that it was pitch black.

They next realized that the lights were not exactly on the ground but at some slight distance above and not to their immediate left as earlier. This was a very low flying object. Less, he says that he is familiar with photographic missions and thinking this may be one, although it did not have the characteristics of any known aircraft. The motion that these objects were following a zig-zag pattern as they went up it seemed they were sort of milling around beyond the point at which the lights would presumably cross the road.

Text from the document:

As he sped on the object, he only continued to come toward him. The object as described by the man continued about as fast as an airliner at about the same altitude. This was about 1,500 feet. The lights on the object were said to be two large, reddish-orange lights the size of automobile headlights, set side by side. These lights appeared to be lit from the inside and gave off a steady glow. There was no noise, no sound, or at most no sound could be heard. The airplane was flying at about 180 knots and even though he continued to pursue the object, it stayed about the same distance ahead of the plane. Though he tried to gain on it, the object was able to maintain its position. The pilot made repeated passes at the object, but it would not veer off or change course in any way. After about 10 minutes, the pilot had to break off the pursuit and return to the airport as he was running low on fuel.

The object was estimated to be about 40 feet in diameter and the pilot stated that the object appeared to be metallic in color, but he could not be certain. The pilot was not able to get a close look at the object, but did state that it appeared to have no visible markings, wings, or other external features. The pilot stated that this was the most unusual and perplexing experience of his career, and that he could not offer any explanation for what he had observed.

Here again we send the aid of a psychologist to help evaluate report. The report here concerned was not completed but (also) the case history was incomplete. According to the psychologist's experience, the psychologist has a real job ahead of him in evaluating these special cases. Psychological data can be difficult to obtain and the psychologist has virtually no facilities for dealing with these cases. Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek

Text from the document:

RODEO, NEW MEXICO
25 SEPTEMBER 1965

At approximately 6:00 P.M., 25 September 1965, two objects first appeared near the horizon. It could not be determined if these objects were attached to a mother craft or if they were independent vehicles. The objects were apparently moving westward on an interesting course with the observer's north bound automobile. The observer maintained a constant speed of about 40-45 mph. The objects paced the automobile while driving across the desert, but as the objects approached the observer, they slowed to a speed slightly slower than the observer's vehicle. The objects appeared to be at an angular separation of 15-20 degrees and still in line astern formation. They remained in this tight formation of about 50 feet for several minutes. The objects then increased speed and within a few seconds appeared to be at an angular separation of 15-45 degrees and still in line. After approximately three minutes from the time the objects began to drop, the observer stated they regained formation and the other maneuver.

COMMENTS:
One possible explanation could be that of two helicopters; however, no sound at all, even with the car window open. A check was made and there were no aircraft in the area at the time of the observation. The motion of the objects and the maneuvers performed are not characteristic of conventional aircraft or ground lights. As such, the case remains unidentified since no physical evidence is available that can offer an explanation.
