Dear Major:

This is to report to you the result of my visit to Holloman Air Force Base at Alamogordo, New Mexico, and on my visit to Deming, New Mexico to interview Dr. and Mrs. [redacted] who made a report from Rodeo, New Mexico on 25 September 1965, on a sighting which we carry as 'unidentified'. I was authorized to make the Holloman trip but the Deming, New Mexico trip occurred to me after I got to New Mexico. It turned out that I had to go less than 100 miles out of my way in order to interview the two witnesses concerned. I informed you of my intention to visit Deming by phone from New Mexico, as you will remember.

Major Hector Quintanilla, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch

Dear Major:

This is the second part of my report on my trip to New Mexico.

On the day after I visited Holloman Air Force Base I drove by private car to Deming, New Mexico, which is 60 miles west of Las Cruces, where I had stopped on my way back. From Holloman, I had noted that the sighting of 25 September 1965, made at Meson, New Mexico, was made by a Dr. and Mrs. [redacted] of Deming, New Mexico. Information was that he has a doctorate in physical chemistry from Columbia University, I felt that their sighting, which has remained unidentified, might best be investigated. Unfortunately, the sighting still remains unidentified, but I have much more corroborative material than was had before.

Dr. and Mrs. [redacted] operate the La Posta restaurant in Deming, New Mexico. It is a somewhat peculiar restaurant, complete with bar. Apparently they do fairly well. I did not feel free to question him as to how it happened that he, a Ph.D. in chemistry, should be operating a restaurant. But apparently he did not like the chemical industry, in which he worked for a number of years, and for that, or health reasons, or both, he moved to New Mexico.

Both he and his wife were quite talkative but they told a sequential story which either has to be believed in the main or in two witness discussed as utterly absurd. They told us their tale while we were seated at a secluded table in their restaurant. Dr. [redacted] did most of the talking but was quite calm in with various comments, sometimes disagreeing on specific points. The sketch herewith is a rough drawing of their journey may have from Douglas to Deming following:


- page 6 -

Here is the text from the document:

-2-

They had been coming north on U.S. 80 from Douglas and had just gotten past the small town of Rodeo and quite near a settlement known as Apache. They had just passed a tiny side road which leads to a settlement known as Animas and which is accordingly known as Animas Road, when they saw at about 2 o'clock position what at first appeared to be track lights hanging down toward them. At was about 1000 P.M. at night and the night was clear and dark, with no moon. They said there were no clouds and it was pitch black. Their first impression was this was a truck coming down the Animas road, but they soon realized that this was impossible, since this was not on the road and they had already passed this road.

They next realized that the lights were not exactly on the ground but at some slight distance above, and so their next feeling was that this was a very low flying mission of some sort. Dr. --- has a pilot's license and has 155 hours clocked, out that was some time ago. Nevertheless, he says that he is familiar with photo missions and thinking that might be that, he deliberately looked for wing tip lights, but did not see any. The lights were moving almost in right angles to U.S. 80, so thinking that if these were a low flying mission there might be a collision, he, Dr. --- stopped or is stopped for 20 miles an hour attempting to get beyond the point at which the lights would presumably cross the road.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

As he sped on the object not only continued to come toward him but seemed to go sideways and keep at the relative position about at right angles to them. Dr. _____ sped on, saying that his thoughts were that "they can't go sideways" and "now such that the lights are going to get us." The lights now seemed to be drifting over them and gradually illuminating the immediate area. They couldn't understand why the objects had lost their forward motion and were now going stationary. Though the yellow haze now spreading, they could not shake the lights, but the lights never got ahead of them. After about a minute or so, the lights fell back and disappeared, one light going out to the northeast. The lights had never actually crossed the road, but had come up close to and probably over the car. The lights apparently disappeared quickly in the distance.

The _______ experienced travelers since their hobby is making water colors of ghost towns on many weekends they travel around the countryside looking for suitable objects. They were very familiar with this particular section of the road, knowing, for instances, that very graphically there were dangerous curves and they would have to slow down. _______ remarked that he remembers nothing to himself that it was fortunate that his head had been turned away so that he could presumably get ahead of the object. It was at the time they slowed down or started to slow down for the oncoming hills and curves that the object disappeared from view.

We seem to have here one of our old familiar patterns, of people being bugged by bright lights, eerie glow close, but doing no physical harm to the witness. The rapid disappearance is also characteristic. The deviation in this story is that the two lights, which both the witnesses had thought were simply advanced to some invisible object, separated.

The _______ do not seem to be UFO addicts although they admitted being familiar with UFO stories which they said crop up frequently in that region. They said they had never read a great many items in the past and were quite familiar with the terrain. They had never seen lights like this before.

So here we have a report related to that of loyal land and a run-bar of others in which the primary thing was a bright line or lights. In all these cases the witness or witnesses definitely have had a very definite experience, and it is hard to see how, except by pure chance, a reasonable, well educated and accustomed to the many sights of the desert, could have mistaken some usual object and had such a remarkable experience. Incidentally, they stated that there were no other cars on the road at the time.

Here again we need the aid of a psychologist to help evaluate how such a report can get started, and also why they seem anxious to report it. If there were no tangible lights present throughout this whole experience, the psychologist has a real job ahead of him to explain how two people can have virtually the same hallucination, and one which seems so patently real to both of them.

Sincerely yours,

J&htar                                J. Allen Hynek

RODEO, NEW MEXICO
25 SEPTEMBER 1965

At approximately 8:00 P.M., 25 September 1965, two objects first appeared near the base of a small 6000 Foot mountain, nine and one-half miles northeast of Rodeo, New Mexico. The objects appeared to be on or near the surface, moving westward on an intersecting course with the observer's north bound automobile. The lights were at an estimated angular separation of one to two degrees. The driver and his wife first thought it was another automobile driving around the desert, but as the objects approached, he realized that they were approximately 30-50 feet above the terrain. He then thought that it was a small aircraft at a low altitude and fearing a possible collision with the object, the observer accelerated to 60 mph and turned. The objects remained with the auto at the higher speed, still at an altitude of about 50 feet. This position was held for approximately two minutes with objects appearing to be at an angular separation of 1-15 degrees and still in line horizontally. The objects then began to move in the area of the auto (to the south), slowly separating with the light changing from white to a light blue. After approximately three minutes from the time the objects began to drop backward, they faded from sight with one apparently moving eastward and the other southeast.

COMMENTS

One possible explanation could be that of two helicopters; however, no running or anti-collision lights were observed and the witnesses heard no sound at all, even with the car window open. A check was made where there were no aircraft in the area at the time of the observation. The motion of the objects tends to rule out the possibility of the sighting being a reflection or mirage of ground lights. As such, the case remains unidentified since no substantial evidence is available that can offer an explanation.
