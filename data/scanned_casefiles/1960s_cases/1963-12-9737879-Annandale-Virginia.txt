December 27, 1963

Dear Colonel [redacted];

This is in reference to the unidentified sighting you reported to this Headquarters earlier this month.

Your observation was discussed with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Professor of Astronomy at Northwestern University, Director of Daedorus Observatory and USAF Consultant to Project Blue Book. Dr. Hynek is of the opinion that the sighting was probably a meteor. While unusual, vapor trails do appear to oscillate.

A real trail has not been common as a white to blue-green trail, however, a reddish trail can be accented at dusk by rays from the setting sun.

The speed of this meteor as estimated by the duration of 2 seconds and 30 degrees or arc distance is consistent with this analysis.

We appreciate your reporting this sighting since the Air Force is always interested in unusual aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
