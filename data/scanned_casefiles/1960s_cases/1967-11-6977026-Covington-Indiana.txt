Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Mr. Robert Hattrich, of Covington, Indiana, has asked me to forward to you a set of 4 prints to confirm that his image of an unusual phenomenon observed on the evening of 20 July 1966, is real. 

On the morning of 12 July 1966, I had a new type of Polaroid film and loaded it in a Polaroid camera and mounted it on a tripod. Seeing and sky conditions were excellent in azimuth (a 5 degree series of 4 prints), and the 7/8 moon and nearby stars could be clearly seen under the excellent conditions.

I am enclosing the four prints showing the moon and sky conditions very clearly. It is my opinion that these prints will be of some use to you in studying this report.

I trust these prints will be of some use to you in studying this report.

Very truly yours,

[Project Manager]

REPORT (UPO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/mns/26 Jun 68
UFO Photographs, 13 November 1967

Covington, Indiana 47932

1. Reference your unidentified flying object photographs of 13 November 1967 which you submitted to the Air Force for analysis. Should this office have not completed its 'analysis program on your six photographs designated as "unidentified" objects, with the following results:

Initial review of the referenced photography revealed the "unidentified objects" were in fact a group of 5 small to medium-sized light points in the sky. An attempt was made to photograph one large and about 12 to 15 small objects, one of which was imaged (print #4). One of the remaining two photos depicted the same general pattern of 5 light points, however only at a greater distance and lessened brilliance, size and composition to that of the "unidentified objects."

An attempt was made to duplicate the star and moon paths with an identical camera and film on a night culminating on the date of the event. This simulation photographing of the moon produced only a slight photographic impression. The apparent "saucer" photo has very sharp edges and a total lack of identty
of a processing aberration. Furthermore, if the full moon could have caused this camera image, the simulation should not have produced the type of photographic image measures 1.03 millimeters. The size and composition of the spot on the "object" print indicate that this image could be that of the moon.

It is concluded that the color of the object is resolved as blue. In all four photographs the object must have been a "blind" above 650 millimeters.

- page 15 -

The image shows a page from an old Project Blue Book report. There is no photograph present in this image. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and extract all the text from the document:

a. A thin black "shell" encompasses the object on three or four points and this shell is probably a halo which is a normal effect when photographing a point source of light. On the fourth point [print (?) ] the object appears to be blurred which may have resulted from camera vibration.

2. The size of the objects could not be determined because distance to the objects is unknown.

3. There is no indication that the images represent anything of extraterrestrial origin.

The image contains a photo analysis report document from Project Blue Book, dated November 18, 1967. The subject of the report is an "Unidentified Flying Object" observed in Covington, Indiana. 

The document states that six Polaroid "Swinger" prints were provided for the analysis. The initial review of the photographs revealed that an "unidentified object" was imaged as a "spot of light" in each of the four prints. The photographs were described as being of "poor" quality.

The report discusses attempts to duplicate the star and moon photography with the object, but concludes that the full moon could not have been clearly imaged as it appears in the photographs. It is suggested that the color of the object must be different from the moon, and that the image could possibly be that of the moon.

Finally, the report mentions that on one of the four prints (print #2), the object appears to be blurred, which could indicate a normal effect when photographing a distant object.

Subj: Conversation with [redacted], 25 June 1969

Mr. [redacted] called the Aerial Phenomena Office, collect, and talked to 2d Lt. Carmon L. Marano, regarding his Polaroid photographs that were to be returned to him (Mr. [redacted]) within six weeks. Lt. Marano stated that the photographs would be returned to him within one week. That Colonel (Unintelligible) had underestimated in which photographic analysis could return the photographs. 

Lt. Marano said that a man by the name of [redacted] from the Space Probe, NASA, Houston, Texas had talked with him regarding [redacted]'s photographs. Also, a physician from the University of Colorado had also spoken with him regarding these photographs. Mr. [redacted] wanted to know if these photographs were legitimate. Lt. Marano explained that [redacted] was working at the University of Colorado in an independent investigation into the study of UFOs, however, we knew nothing about that investigation and it was not sponsored by him.

Mr. [redacted] said that he was in agreement with him ([redacted]) that he indeed was seeing things that he had also observed the same thing. However, upon questioning, Mr. [redacted] stated that Mr. [redacted] would not tell what he had observed.

Mr. [redacted] said that the Smithsonian Institution, agreed to get him [redacted] cameras and equipment when the analysis accomplished by the Air Force. Lt. Marano said he would return the photographs within 1 to 1 1/2 weeks, however, before then, he would like to discuss this matter further with Dr. [redacted].

Aerial Phenomena Office can provide an evaluation we would need three AF Forms 117 completed that Lt. Marano had given to previously. said he had filled them out but was await outcome on the photographic analysis. Lt. Marano said "before the case I need the AF Forms 117." He would, however, give the aerial photographic analysis. Also the case is very old and I really investigate the case. said he would send in the for he was anxious to get the originals back in good for he had someone lined up to see the pictures to. Lt.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJ: UFO Photographs by Lt Marano 
Lt Marano called in and said he has evidence on 1 May 1968, 1515 hours. Lt Marano was at work, therefore, Lt Marano left a message asking to come to Dayton to turn over his photographs.

On 2 May 1968, he returned Lt Marano's call, and we could find no evidence to come to Dayton and see Lt Colonel B Colonel Quintanilla with regards to his photographs and also ask him about some of the articles that have appeared in the various magazines on UFOs.

Lt Marano said he has been seeing UFOs for three summers now, the night before Christmas and throughout the year. Some of them looked like aircraft lights but he couldn't do anything as they seemed to be aircraft lights. However, something showed on his camera and he wanted to come to Dayton on 6 May. Lt Marano explained that he was not sure whether the Colonel would be in then or not so he would leave a message with his wife on 3 May.

On 3 May 1968 Lt Marano informed that Lt Colonel Quintanilla would be in the office on the morning of 6 May 1968 and was expecting his visit.

On 6 May 1968, Lt Colonel Quintanilla visited the Aerial Phenomena Office and spoke to Lt Colonel Quintanilla and Lt Marano. He related his past sightings were quite vague. He has been seeing them for three years now and his neighbors know about them. He is not a member of NICAP or any other organization. However, on his own he has contacted different police departments and read of the UFO reports they have received. He tried to relate some of the information he has learned.

- page 27 -

The image does not contain any photographs. The text in the document describes a sighting of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that Lt. Mareno and Col. Quintenilla observed on November 19. The document discusses details of their sighting, including the objects appearing low on the horizon and the observers using binoculars to view them. It also mentions the observers completing Air Force Forms 117 to document the sighting. The text does not identify any individuals in the sighting.

Lt Mareno and Col Quintenilla all details of his sighting of 19 November however, do to the time lapse he said he couldn't remember that much. said often times these objects appear low on the horizon and looked larger but they keep moving and changing colors. They even done this he put binoculars on them. said he couldn't estimate as size since he had never been in an airplane, however, most of these objects below what he called the star level. Sometimes he would watch the objects for several hours and other times it would be for just minutes. said he was certain they were because they are always coming out of Chanute and Bunker Hill and make a lot of noise, however, the objects observed did not make any noise. Lt Mareno asked him to give a description of the sighting. In particular, stressing the time that each photo was taken, the order of the photos and the azimuth and elevation of the objects when each photo was taken. It seemed from his description that there were several sightings that night. However, it was difficult to determine if the photos were taken of one sighting or during several sightings. Lt Mareno gave him four AF Forms 117 and asked him to complete them so that we could better understand the sequence of events as they occurred that night. said that he would complete and return these forms.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: UFO Observation, 18 Nov 67
Mrs. _____ of Covington, Indiana, area called and said a neighbor reported seeing a suspected unidentified object. Also a person that lives approximately 20 miles from there and taken pictures of an unidentified object and wanted to know if he should send them to Wright-Patterson AFB or to Chanute or to Grissom. Lt Marano informed him that the report should be made to the nearest Air Force Base. He said this was from Marshall, Illinois on 2 February 1963. _____ said he has been seeing these quite frequently now, also saw them last December and he has checked some of the radars have picked them up because Major Nichols at Chanute said their radar couldn't pick them up. On the 2nd of December, _____ also made a drawing of it. Lt Marano informed that we couldn't perform a photo analysis with the vague data that Capt Arrington had provided. _____ said he sat in his house in the living room for several hours he also filled out a bunch of forms to Chanute. Lt Marano also informed that we would need to get the original Polaroid Prints to perform such an analysis. Lt Marano said he would give them to us if he would get them back. However, the analysis would take several months to run. He said he felt that six months would be a reasonable length of time in which to perform analysis. Lt Marano said he felt that analysis could probably be done in that length of time and at the cost we would inform him of our findings. _____ said that if he didn't get them back within or at the end of six months he would write his congressman.

He said he thought maybe he would ask his co about it. Lt Marano told him that he could send his request to (SAFQICC) Lt Col Stiles, Washington, D.C 20330. This seemed to satisfy him.

He has been seeing these things. Didn't see them before this, but now all of a sudden they come over quite often. Lt Marano asked him if he would complete some forms and send his photographs in. He replied that he would.

The text in the document states:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
SUBJECT: MOON PHOTOGRAPHY
LOCATION: Covington, Indiana
DATE: 18 November
PHOTOGRAPHY: Fair Polaroid Prints and six copies of Polaroid Originals

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 68-67, submitted 18 November at Covington, Indiana. This analysis is a follow-on to analysis for Work Order 68-27.

2. ANALYSIS: Since the original polaroid prints are not included in the report, a direct comparison of the two moon images could not be made at this time.

3. Since the original polaroid photos were not included, a moon image could not be made between the sources photos and Mr. [redacted] photos.

The remainder of the text appears to be the analysis and recommendations related to the moon photography, but does not describe any photograph within the document.

1. On the night of 18 Nov 1967, at approximately 10:30 p.m. local time, a couple living next door looked outside and saw an elderly couple outside their house. The elderly couple was attracted to the sky since it was clouding in. While looking into the southeastern direction, they watched a peculiar light pass across the sky from SE to NW. Her attention fell to a second "light" following the first. The time was between 10:30 - 10:40. As they looked inside and told her husband what she had seen. "They both went out still a third "formation" was seen coming from the SE. Policyhold camera at the request of her husband because he wanted to see if the objects would "show up" on the film. Time lapse approximately 10 minutes (10:40 - 10:52). By this time the first object disappeared overhead, the second "formation" showed up again nearer in attitude, but not so distinctive in brilliance and composition, compared with the first. Also took a sharp backing from the film. Only the larger object in two shots and two follow one another in their sequence the smaller ones.

2. The flight path appeared straight, the objects going from SE to NW. There was no note heard. The lead object did not change position or altitude or laterally, and the "diamond formation" maintained its integrity through the observation. No hovering or apparent speed change.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report describing a UFO sighting.

The text from the document is as follows:

noticed. The lead object was much more brilliant than the smaller objects. Its color was not a solid appearing color but a "faded" blue hue which seemed to intermittently revolve. The smaller objects were less brilliant and no color was observed. During the observation, the smaller objects left the diamond formed by the formation and appeared to have been lost in the vastness of space. After it was certain the objects had been dece ased, When the smaller object had fully disappeared inside the larger object and the colors reappeared.

3. When the film had developed, an aura as well as a "halo" appeared both above and around the objects. These "halos" were not visible to the naked eye.

4. All the objects appeared round, there was no trail or exhaust found. The size could not be estimated except that it was less than being about the size of an automobile. The largest of the objects to appear measured approximately 13-15 feet in diameter. The photos were made while the objects were stationary. The photographed area was also in the center of the 35 millimeter film strip.
Based on 40° latitude, the moon was at 60-80° elevation in the S.

5. The camera used was a model 20, Polaroid Swinger, with the shutter set at 1/300 second. The film used was regular high speed which is most common in this type camera. No filters used, no tripid used.

However, to appear to be a "UFO Bug". He continuously emphasized the fact that he did not want to be involved in publicity and wanted anyone who did not call prior to coming to his home. He seemed open minded, however was reluctant to talk to those who were not call ing the observed phenomena. He did refer to the larger object as a "Mother Ship" lacked another more descriptive term. He stated the reason he wanted the photographs was because he would like to compare them with what he had observed. It is possible that what he had observed was unusual to him, particularly because of what he had observed was unusual to him.

Text from the document:

ON 2 JAN 68, M. Covington, Indiana, a neighbor, had told him that men similar objects on 18 Nov 67. For interview, The Montgomery County Police, Fountain County Police, and the Indiana State Police in Lafayette, Indiana, were contacted. All replies were negative. However, it should be noted that on other dates several sightings of unidentified objects in the area were made to state police. Also, the LaFayette, Indiana State Police on 19 Nov reported a sighting of a red revolving light moving slowly to the south. The sighting was about Pine Village, Indiana. In an interview with M. E., the Smithsonian Institute Astrophysical Survey revealed that their cameras is pointed in the direction from Covington toward Decatur and it showed no unidentified object. It is interesting to note that a video tape during a scanning on approximately 9 Nov 1967, revealed two (2) identifiable objects. This information is included to point out that other graphed unidentifiable objects were in the area at about the early part of November 1967. A film of this video tape was obtained by Wright-Patterson AFB for proceeding; however, it has been returned.

REPORT: COVINGTON, INDIANA  
CASE FILE: 6977026 
DATE: 6 NOVEMBER 1967
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

WITNESS: MR. JAMES COVINGTON, AGE 42, FARMER 

AT APPROXIMATELY 8:15 PM ON THE EVENING OF 6 NOVEMBER 1967, MR. COVINGTON REPORTED OBSERVING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WHILE WORKING IN HIS FIELD NEAR COVINGTON, INDIANA. MR. COVINGTON STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING APPROXIMATELY 50 YARDS ABOVE THE GROUND AND WAS EMITTING A BRIGHT LIGHT. HE ESTIMATED THE OBJECT TO BE BETWEEN 20-25 FEET IN DIAMETER. MR. COVINGTON OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 10-15 MINUTES BEFORE IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

CONCLUSION: CASE REMAINS UNRESOLVED. NO FURTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE.

The image contains a black and white photograph that appears to be a blurry, low-quality image. The photograph shows a grainy, indistinct object or entity that is difficult to make out clearly. There does not appear to be any human faces or figures visible in the image.

OPENING VISUAL APPEARANCE
     Large irregular shaped object about 50' in
     diameter hovering approximately 300 feet above 
     a field.
DESCRIPTION
     A large round object, approximate diameter 50 feet,
     was observed hovering at an altitude of about 300
     feet above a field by the observer, who was seated
     in his car at the side of a rural road near Covington,
     Indiana. The object was first spotted about 8:15
     P.M. on November 6, 1967, while the observer was
     driving along the road. The object was visible for
     about 10 minutes before it moved slowly northward
     and disappeared from view. The sky was clear at the
     time and no sounds were heard from the object.
CONCLUSION
     Despite the clear visual sighting, no physical evidence
     was obtained. The report is therefore classified as
     UNIDENTIFIED.

The image appears to contain a letter from the Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory addressed to Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Lt. Colonel, USAF Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office. The letter discusses the sending of four prints showing the moon at various stages of the moon, which were taken using a Polaroid camera on July 12, 1968. The letter indicates that the Polaroid camera was able to clearly image the full moon, and the project manager believes these prints may be of use in studying the moon.

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Mr. Raymond Covington, Indiana, has asked me to confirm that his Polaroid "Swinger" 20 camera (serial no. M9 7/13/16) is capable of clearly imaging the full moon. I agreed to supply him with 4 prints of a series of photographs that his images are reality - the moon.

On the morning of 12 July 1968, Mr. Covington and I loaded his camera with a new roll of type 20 high speed Polaroid film and fixed the camera to a surveyor's tripod. Seeing only second magnitude stars visible, the tripod was leveled and the camera was pointed at the full moon.

Multiple exposures were use in prints 3 and 4 to offset for poor conditions.

I am enclosing the four prints showing the moon at various stages of its cycle. It is my opinion that these prints are capable of producing an image as dense as his 18 November 1967 "moon" print.

I trust these prints will be of some use to you in studying the moon.

Very truly yours,
[Redacted]
Project Manager

COVINGTON, INDIANA REPORT

On the evening of 6 November 1967, my wife and I observed a very bright orange light in the sky while on our way home from Danville, Indiana. The light appeared to be about 30-40 degrees above the horizon in the southwest direction. The light seemed to be hovering or slowly moving back and forth. After watching it for about 5 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly out of sight to the northwest. The entire sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes.

I am a licensed private pilot and am familiar with all conventional aircraft. This light did not resemble any known aircraft. It appeared to be self-luminous and was much brighter than any normal aircraft lights. The rapid acceleration when it left was also very unusual for any conventional aircraft.

I am reporting this sighting to BLUE BOOK as I believe it was an unidentified flying object.

CAUTION: This process uses a caustic jelly which, if not safely handled, can cause severe injury to the eyes and skin. The jelly will stain clothes and most surfaces. Handle the print by the edges only, as contact with the jelly can stain hands. It is extremely important to keep the jelly from the face, eyes, and skin. Wear rubber gloves if possible. Avoid getting the jelly on any surface as it is extremely difficult to remove.

ACCOUNT OF SIGHTING

On 6 November 1967, at approximately 5:50 p.m., Mr. Mitchell, a resident of Covington, Indiana, sighted an unidentified flying object (UFO) over a field near his home. The object was described as being oval in shape, silver in color, and approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter. It was observed hovering for several minutes at an estimated altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 feet, before rapidly ascending and disappearing from view. No sound was reported to be associated with the object. 

Mr. Mitchell immediately contacted the local Sheriff's office to report the sighting. An investigation was subsequently conducted by the Air Force's Project Blue Book, which is responsible for the evaluation of reported UFO incidents.

The image provided does not contain a photograph. Instead, it appears to be a page from a document with a large grainy square taking up the majority of the frame, likely representing some form of image or visual data. However, the image quality is too poor to discern any clear details or content within the square.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:
