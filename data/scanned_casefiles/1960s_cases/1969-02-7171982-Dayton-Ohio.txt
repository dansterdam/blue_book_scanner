[Top Section Instructions:]
DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON; INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

[Bottom Section Instructions:]
WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR POLE. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE MATCH IS COVERED BY THE OBJECT. THEN ESTIMATE THE ANGULAR SIZE. IF YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON YOU'D HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH.

MEMO FOR RECORD                                                28 Feb 1969

SUBJECT:  18 Feb 1969 Sighting

1.  On 18 Feb 1969, Mr. [redacted] (Meteorology) called USAF (UVO) to report an object he was observing. He stated that while he was talking to us, the object rose about 1500 feet then dropped rapidly. He said the object looked like it was in the vicinity of Patterson Field.

2.  Sgt. Jones called Sulpher Grove to see if there were any balloons launched around 1230-1315, and they (Sulpher Grove) said they launched their balloon about 1000-1030 hours and it came down about 1135 hours. It would have stayed up for about 30 min. maximum and then burst. Sgt. Jones asked them if the balloon could have been over the area where the observation (location - Linden) was, and he said it probably would have been over that area because the winds were from the N-NE direction.

3.  Sgt. Jones then called FAA (on base) and spoke with Mr. [redacted]. Sgt. Jones asked him if there were any aircraft in the air between 1230-1315 that could have been over Woodman and Linden at the approximate time of the sighting. Mr. [redacted] told him that there were very definitely could have been because they were using Runway #5, and the aircraft were coming in from the SE to base then turning SE to Runway #5. He said their position would be near SE, SW position.

4.  FAA called "DPP" (UVO) back to report a Cessna 150 on a photo mission. This plane was climbing to certain altitudes up to 23,000 feet, taking pictures, then coming back down. The Cessna was operating within a 5-mile radius of Patterson Field. FAA stated that there could have been 7 flashes of light from the plane, but the plane did not have a strobe light. The radar position of the plane was 6 ml SW of Patterson with an easterly heading. We called Mr. [redacted] back to report the presence of the small Cessna aircraft doing work in the area. Mr. [redacted] stated that the Cessna was part of the project he was working, and that he was not watching it. Lt. Marino and Sgt. Jones then went to the office in the Clay St. Building and with binoculars identified the stimulus as a kite.

*Strobe light - white flashing light used in place of red flashing light usually used on aircraft. Could be visible in daylight.

UFO Observation, 10 Feb 1969

Dayton, Ohio 45431

Reference your UFO sighting of 10 Feb 1969. We believe that you may have sighted a bright meteor called a fireball. Fireballs are rather rare and curious for some Circleville. have been reported to be as long as 30 seconds although the most common is 1 to 2 seconds.

A fireball was sighted at 9:09 p.m. SST by a member of the Volunteer Pilot Civil Air Patrol Network who was flying as 25,000 Ft. at 360 21' West longitude as 38° 55' North Latitude, and we believe you may have sighted the same meteor. Your report will be forwarded to Dr. Olivier of the American Meteor Society for documentation of the fireball sighting.
