11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched two amber colored objects ascend and descend on a vertical plane. The objects were going on and off like a light being, turned off. Each object glowed brightly then disappeared.

The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. The investigating official feels that the sighting was caused by various astronomical bodies.

UNIVERSITE LAVAL
Quebec, Canada

March 30, 1967.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,

THIS IS TO REPORT THE SIGHTING OF AN
UNUSUAL LIGHT PHENOMENON IN THE SKY.

PLACE: ISLAMORADA, IN THE FLORIDA KEYS, ON THE BEACH OF THE MOTEL
LA JOLLA WHERE I WAS VACATIONING.

TIME: EITHER THE 6TH, THE 7TH OR THE 8TH OF JANUARY 1967 - I DO
NOT REMEMBER EXACTLY, AT ABOUT 8:30 AT NIGHT.

DESCRIPTION

I WAS ALONE, LOUNGING IN A BEACH CHAIR (RECLINING) AND LOOKING AT THE
SKY OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND THE STARS SHINING
BRIGHTLY, EXCEPT FOR A FEW SMALL AND VERY VAPOROUS CLOUDS SCATTERED
HERE AND THERE AND PUSHED BY A SLOW EASTERLY WIND.

I WAS TRYING TO FIND THE NORTH STAR. I FINALLY IDENTIFIED - OR THOUGHT
I IDENTIFIED - CASSIOPEA. IT TOOK ME A FEW SECONDS TO UNDERSTAND ITS
UNUSUAL POSITION: I HAD NOT REALIZED THAT, SINCE I HAD COME 2000 MILES
SOUTH OF QUEBEC, THE ANGLE OF THE NORTH STAR WITH THE HORIZON WAS
SMALLER THAN AT QUEBEC.

SUDDENLY, 15 OR 20° SOUTH OF CASSIOPEA AND 20 OR 25° ABOVE THE HORIZON,
I SAW A LIGHT MOVING UPWARDS, WHICH I TOOK FOR A SHOOTING STAR, JUST A
LITTLE BIGGER THAN A SHOOTING STAR, THE COLOR OF WHICH WAS WHITE WITH
A BLUISH HUE. AT ABOUT 45° ABOVE THE HORIZON, THE LIGHT JERKED SUDDENLY
TO MY RIGHT AND TRAVELLED MORE OR LESS NORTH, AT A RIGHT ANGLE WITH ITS
PREVIOUS DIRECTION, FOR ABOUT 25°, THEN JERKED SUDDENLY AGAIN IN A
MORE OR LESS NORTH-WEST DIRECTION, WENT DOWN FOR ABOUT 15 OR 20° AND
DISAPPEARED.

THE WHOLE THING LASTED ONLY A FEW SECONDS, 5 OR 6, PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE. THE SPEED WAS ABOUT THAT OF A SHOOTING STAR.

I HAD NEVER SEEN A LIGHT MOVING IN SUCH A FASHION IN THE SKY. THE NEAREST MOVEMENT I KNOW OF WOULD BE THAT OF THE BEAM OF A SEARCHLIGHT IN THE CLOUDS - I MEAN THE END OF THE BEAM. THERE WAS NO SHAFT OF LIGHT IN THIS CASE AS IN THE CASE OF A SEARCHLIGHT. ANOTHER DIFFERENCE: AFTER THE FIRST TURN, THERE WAS A LITTLE FLUTTERING IN THE MOTION OF THE LIGHT, WHICH LASTED TO THE END.

I THOUGHT THAT THE EXPLANATION OF A SEARCHLIGHT COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE PHENOMENON BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS VISIBLE IN THE DARK SKY AS WELL AS BEFORE (?) A SMALL CLOUD. THINKING ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS, I REALLY COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THE LIGHT HAD PASSED BEHIND OR BEFORE THAT CLOUD, NOR COULD I REMEMBER WHETHER THE LUMINOSITY HAD CHANGED WHEN IT WAS BEFORE (OR BEHIND) THE CLOUD. MY IMPRESSION IS THAT I PERCEIVED NO DIFFERENCE SINCE IT IS ONLY WHEN ANALYSING THE PHENOMENON THAT SUCH A QUESTION WAS RAISED IN MY MIND. I WOULD SAY THAT THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE NEARER THAN A SHOOTING STAR, BUT IT IS HARD TO EVALUATE ITS DISTANCE.

A ROCKET LAUNCHED FROM A SHIP WOULD HAVE HAD THE FLUTTERING MOTION I NOTICED DURING PART OF THE PHENOMENON, BUT IT WOULD NOT, AT LEAST IN MY KNOWLEDGE, MAKE SUCH JERKY TURNS.

I TOLD SOME PEOPLE AT THE MOTEL, WHO LISTENED WITH FRIENDLY INTEREST. I TOLD SOME FRIENDS ON MY RETURN HERE, WHO SAID THAT IT ONLY SHOWED HOW BADLY I HAD BEEN IN THE NEED OF A VACATION. IT IS TRUE THAT I NEEDED ONE BADLY, BEING VERY PHYSICALLY TIRED AT THE TIME.

THE PHENOMENON WAS CERTAINLY REAL, WHATEVER IT WAS, AND VERY CLEAR. I WAS LOUNGING, MOTIONLESS, WHEN IT STARTED; I JUST LOOKED AT IT WITHOUT MOVING. I WEAR GLASSES AND I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

A SHOOTING STAR AND A SPECK OF REFLECTION FROM MY GLASSES THAT MAY
SOMETIMES BE CAUSED BY A SUDDEN MOVEMENT OF MY HEAD- WHICH MOVEMENT
I DID NOT MAKE IN THIS CASE.

UFO Sighting, 8 Jan 67

2 MAR 1967

1. Reference your letter, subject same as above, dated 7 Feb 67.

2. We reached the conclusion that it "was an UFO sighting and not a radar malfunction or something of this nature" because it appeared on two different radar sets, operating on different frequencies, and then was sighted visually by an experienced pilot. (LtCol piloting a MAC C-97). The object was first sighted by Goose Radar Air Traffic Control. They called for verification to the 6th1st ACW Squadron.

Both of these organizations are in the business of knowing of aircraft in the area. The possibility of its being an unknown aircraft cannot be completely ruled out, but it is a slim possibility in view of:

a. Lack of knowledge of any traffic by either control agency.

b. Our remoteness from population necessitates more stringent flight planning rules.

c. The speed attributed to the object by the radar observer at the 6th1st ACW Squadron. He followed it for 12 sweeps on an AN/FPS-93 and estimated its speed to be 200 knots. During the last four (4) sweeps the speed was 2100 knots.

SUMMARY UFO SIGHTING
(CONFIDENTIAL)

WITNESS:
ADDRESS: Boxford, Mass.
PHONE:

LOCATION OF SIGHTING: Ipswich Road, Boxford, Mass.
DATE: Estimated 2nd week January 1967
TIME: Approximately 3:00 AM
DURATION: Approximately 1 Minute

SIGHTING:

The witness arose in the morning to obtain a drink of water. He noticed a red light coming up from the horizon and approaching his home out of his kitchen window. The object appeared at first as a streak or dash but when closer appeared as round with more curvature to the top than bottom. The object was of an "iridescent" red color with a white stripe about its midection. The object displayed no running lights and appeared to glide or float. No sound was heard.

The object passed from the witness' line-of-sight at the kitchen window as it went over the house. The witness immediately went into his living room to see if the object was visible from this (opposite) side of his home. He did not see the object so he returned to the kitchen window. Here he caught sight of the object which had previously turned above his home. The object passed in view across the kitchen window and headed once again towards his home. The witness once again lost sight of it from this vantage point and so went again to the living room but saw nothing. He returned to the kitchen to see the object pass across his view and out-of-sight below the tree-line from where it had originally come.

The witness felt fairly certain that the total viewing time amounted to about a full minute. He did not seem to be able to judge the object's distance. Although he stated to Chairman Raymond Fowler that it was about 5000' up during my interview, he had stated to Chairman Raymond Fowler that it was about 4000' feet altitude. The largest apparent size of the object was compared by him to that of a dime held at arm's length.

The witness told no one of his experience until talking with a good friend who began talking about UFOs. The witness then related his experience to this friend who-in-turn phoned Chairman Raymond Fowler.

EVALUATION:

The witness struck me as being sober, intelligent and of average capability as an observer. He obviously was not seeking publicity as he demands his name be kept confidential. He apparently was relating K7C


- page 31 -

2nd wk Jan 67/Boxford, Mass.

quite truthfully his observation of something he could not identify.

His estimate of apparent size of the object, distance of the object and estimate of the real size of the object do not coincide. I believe the most accurate of these estimates is that of the apparent size of the object. I would place less confidence in the other estimates. The object, as described, is hard to explain as that of a conventional aircraft.

Richard A. Fowler
NICAP MASS INVESTIGATOR

CHAIRMAN'S NOTE

I checked on the reliability of the witness through a lawyer friend who lives in the same neighborhood. He was considered very reliable and not the type who would investigate a hoax. It is interesting to note that UFO sightings took place at N. Adams, Mansfield, Springfield, and Ware during the mid-January time frame. The N. Adams, Springfield, and Ware sightings of 18 January was of a brilliant red object with dome and white light. Reports are being compiled on some of these as-well-as other sightings occurring in February.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
Chairman: NICAP MASS SUBCOM
