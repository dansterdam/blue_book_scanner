10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
While blinking light in flight from West to East. Duration lasted 15 seconds. Alt of obj unknown.

Statement that obj had rapid transit across sky considerable arc. Reports of this nature listing alt as unknown are interpreted to mean that the obj is at considerable height, usually in the atmosphere, at least they are a considerable distance above the reporting a/c. Such items as intensely and manner of its appearance are omitted from the CIRVIS format.

Were these items included there is a slight possibility that an evaluation might be made, however, slight blinking a few times a second causing a considerable segment of the sky in 15 sec when it is assumed that the obj is far away does not fall into any known category of sightings. Case listed as UNIDENTIFIED.

11. COMMENTS
Under observation from military a/c. Rapid transit across sky.
