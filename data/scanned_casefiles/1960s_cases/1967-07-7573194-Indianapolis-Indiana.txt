(CONFLICTING DATA)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted an object that he said looked like two soup bowls connected together, or two circles with 3/4 of each circle cut away and connected. The entire object looked something like binoculars. The observer also stated that he saw the object for 50 seconds. Comments: One observer stated the object was in view for only 10 seconds and looked like a meteor. Although one witness says it looked like a meteor and there were 3 satellite decays that might have been responsible for the case, it is being carried as conflicting data.

TPFT (UFO)   Maj Quintanilla/70916/mbs/21 Dec 67

UFO Observations, 31 Jul 67 and 6 Sep 67

See Attached List for Addressees

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of two different unidentified flying object reports from the Indianapolis area.

2. On the evening of 31 July 1967, one observer saw an object, that when best described by own sighting, looked like two connected white illuminated rolls of toilet tissue. These were connected so that when looking at the object, from directly underneath, it would look similar to the end of a pair of binoculars.

3. We also received a report from the morning of 6 September 1967 in which another observer sighted a white saucer shaped craft that was flat on the top and bottom.

4. If you were in the area on or about these days, or if you know what may have been the cause for the sightings, we would appreciate your letting us know.

5. Thank you for any assistance that you can provide in helping us to solve these two cases.

1. Reference the attached unidentified flying object (UFO) report of 31 July 1967, Indianapolis, Indiana. Additional information has been received from the witness.

2. The sighting had been carried as unidentified and you were given copies of the report. The case has been re-evaluated as conflicting and that three satellite decays like a meteor plus or minus twelve hours occurred on 1 August 1967 at 1200Z

1. If I have looked at this case once I have certainly looked it more than a dozen times. Each time I looked at it I have put it down with a sense of frustration. Before the second Battson report came in there was very good agreement among the three observers. How much of this was due to collusion, of course, we do not know. Even so, the frustration curtain could be lifted only by an interview with the three boys at the site of the sighting, and in view of the youth of the observers I hesitate to suggest such an expenditure of time and money.

2. Now report No. 2 from the sighting and apparently made in a hurry and certainly not comparing in thought or detail to the reports of the other observers. Some items are left blank, and all in all, it gives the impression that this young lad filled the questionnaire out in a hurry under pressure to get it over with. Was this the case?

3. The attached table compares some basic items in the various reports. In the direction of travel all early reports agree but the Battson No. II indicates the thing came from a higher altitude to a lower. As far as duration is concerned, the Battson II report says both one minute and ten seconds, the former agreeing with previous reports. The only mention of moonlight is made in Battson II and this is understandable since if I were to ask any of my students whether there was moonlight or not on the first day of their vacation last year I doubt that any would remember. There is general agreement as to partial to full cloudiness and in the manner of disappearance of the object.

The basic description and the drawings of the first three reports are in good agreement, if one allows that two soup bowls attached might resemble two rolled or toilet attached. The apparent sizes in the first three reports agree but this was left blank in the Battson II report.

Although there is some conflict between the reports, I feel the conflict arises from both faded memory and a sloppy filling out of the second report.

4. My own preference for an evaluation would be "insufficient and somewhat conflicting data". Since the insufficiency can be removed only by further, and personal, interrogation I think this is a good evaluation. Certainly cannot be evaluated as a meteor nor as a re-entry because the object in no case was observed as giving off smoke or changing brightness. The duration for a meteorite is too long and is at the limits of what might be allowed in a re-entry.

If I were a lawyer I would disregard the Battson II report on the basis of lack of quality in comparison to the previous three reports.

Nevertheless, an interesting case and we must ask once again, what was the stimulus that gave rise to the report?

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
