27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

It until this time to take beyond believed
control my thinking that this is only
UFO sighted. I have heard my thinking that
this is only a unusual phenomenon.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a text-based document from the Department of the Air Force regarding a UFO report.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

The image contains a photograph of a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page appears to be a "Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire" that was filled out. It includes a sketch of the sighted object and several questions about the details of the sighting.

Text from the document:

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE IS DESIGNED TO OBTAIN AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENON THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS. THE INFORMATION YOU GIVE WILL BE USED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS REPORT.

1. WHEN DID YOU FIRST SEE THE PHENOMENON?
DAY: FEBRUARY 6 MONTH: 69 YEAR: 1969

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR: MINUTES: 20 [A.M. is checked]

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR: 3 MINUTES: 20 [A.M. is checked]

4. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU FIRST SAW THE PHENOMENON? [CENTRAL is checked]
IF IN CITY, GIVE THE NEAREST STREET AND INDICATE ON SKETCH WHERE YOU WERE ON OR NEAR AND TRY TO FIX A DISTANCE AND DIRECTION FROM SOME RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK.

A sketch is provided showing the observer's location and the direction and path of the sighted object.

The document appears to be part of a Project Blue Book UFO investigation, with the filename indicating it is from 1969.

- page 5 -

The image contains two sketches or illustrations:

1. A compass-like diagram showing directions, with labels for the cardinal and intermediate directions.

2. Two sketches depicting landscapes, with a person standing in the foreground of each sketch.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE - PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "T" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "T" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. SKETCH A SOLID LINE TO REPRESENT THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON, IF POSSIBLE. IF NOT, SKETCH A BROKEN LINE TO SHOW THE APPROXIMATE COURSE. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

Beneath the questions, there is a handwritten response that reads: "behind the helicopter pole. Couldn't be seen except occasionally a slight movement."

- page 9 -

The image appears to be a blank page, containing no photograph. It seems to be an instruction page or a portion of a document related to Project Blue Book, providing guidance on how to document observations of unidentified phenomena.

IS. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THIS IMAGE IF THE PHENOMENON. IF FILLED AND LABELED AS INDICATED, AND THESE DETAILS THAT WOULLD BE APPARENT FROM THE PICTURE REGARDING SHAPE, MOTION, TRAIL, INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE APPROXIMATE ANGULAR SIZE HELD OF KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR FEATURE AT THAT DISTANCE? SHOW BY DRAWING WHAT IT COVERED IN THE FIELD OF VIEW AND ESTIMATE WHAT PORTION OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE OBJECT. INDICATE WHAT PORTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

The text appears to be instructions for documenting observations of unidentified phenomena, including providing a sketch or diagram of the object and its motion, as well as estimating the angular size of the object compared to a known reference.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a form with various questions and fields to be filled out.
