Summer 1965
Sherman, Texas

Dear Mr. Brown: Last summer one Sunday morning I was driving from barely morning to Sherman and listened on just beyond Melissa's highway on a straight ahead within I saw a sailer type plane make a turn, I was at Sherman but I gave it little that I did mention it to Mrs. who was riding in the front seat with me, she watched him about 7 or 8 minutes. He saw the same plane make a 2 turn, same color & same size. I did not see the second plane due to heavy traffic.

The sailer type plane I saw was a dark which color and was about 125 ft to 140 ft across the top. We both figured it was some experiment of the air space.

Here is the text from the document:

Well, gave it little thought. The plane maneuvered with little trouble and I could see the advantages of such a ship, it made the U. turn in 4 to 1/2 space it would take a conventional jet. It seemed to be shaped like an umbrella and looked like it was about 12 to 18 ft. at the thickest point. I saw no lights, exhaust or windows.

about 11 A.M. dark green color

The plane came in this form

Then made a U turn

Then leveled off in this shape

Then returned North.

This was over the Air field at Sherman, so I dragged the matter.

Sincerely Yours,
Rev [name redacted]
