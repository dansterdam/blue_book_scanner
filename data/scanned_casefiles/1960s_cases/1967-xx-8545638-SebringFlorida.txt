Dear[REDACTED],

This replies to your recent correspondence of May 24, 1967 in which you requested information on your unidentified sighting of January 23, 1967.

The delay in reporting your observation prevents a comprehensive investigation, since air activity records are normally destroyed after thirty days.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified object, please contact the UFO Investigator at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, area code 513, 257-0915.

Enclosed is information on the Air Force's program on UFOs.

Harster Hall
SEBRING, FLORIDA 33870 • THE GOLFER'S FIRST RESORT                January 25, 1967

SEBRING, EVERGREEN 5-0151

United States Air Force
Unit Investigating U. F. O's
The Pentagon
Washington, D. C.

Gentlemen:

I live at [redacted], approximately 2 1/2 miles west of the central part of the city of Sebring in Florida. At approximately 0515 G.M.T. on January 25 my wife was driving home from our hotel and saw a bright, pulsating object through the trees.

She came into the house and spoke to me of this, and although at first I didn't believe her, I finally went outside to look at it. The object was approximately 150 west of due south, and about 15° above the horizon. It was the brightest object in the sky, by far except for the flares which were being dropped on the bombing range, which is cast by north of us. Of course, it was not brighter than the moon, but it was brighter than the brightest star.

The object pulsed white, red, and then either blue or green. We could not be sure which. The pulses were not over a constant frequency, but were very apparent.

We called out our neighbor, Ann Kahn, and our other neighbor on the other side of our house, who brought out a telescope and a set of binoculars. By this time the object was in the same portion of the sky. We could see it smaller and smaller, except brighter than the brightest star. When you put the object in the field of the telescope it would sometimes move out of the field in approximately one minute. When we would like the object up over a tree several hundred yards away, we could then move off in an easterly or westerly direction and line it up over another tree. This, of course, let me to believe that the object was quite distant at the time we were taking these particular observations.

Police Report UFO
'Sighting Caused
By Burning Logs

Williamstown Police Chief Joseph Zollo Jr. today attributed some Zollo's reports of unidentified flying objects (UFO) to burning logs and reflections.

The UFO sightings were made by three men on Route 43 near Mt. Hope Farm.

The chief, who did not know that the men had seen burning logs, said patrolmen had investigated the complaint, said today that the red lights were burning logs fanned by the wind. "A patrolman said the report by the three men was "greatly exaggerated."

Reporters who sightings were Denis E. Dufresne, a student at North Adams State College, and Robert Dufresne, who work at the Phoenix Hotel in Adams.

Letters To The Transcript

Convinced Object
Was a Real UFO

Editor: Of the many stories that have appeared in your paper about the Great Barrington area UFO sightings, our story was "exaggerated." We can assure you that we know how exaggerated the story was. Two patrolmen were escorted to the scene yet there was no record of this incident for three days. It also shows quite obviously what we actually saw, we would like to go on record from the beginning of our experience to its termination (as reported in your paper would like to explain to the public exactly what we saw that night).

Police Chief
Debunks UFOs

WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. - Police Chief Joseph Zollo Jr. said Monday night that reports of a UFO sighting Wednesday were investigated and two officers and a civilian dismissed as groundless.

The burning logs story in the Springfield Sunday Republican which alleged that two employees at the Phoenix Hotel in North Adams reported a sighting by a North Adams State College student and two employees at the Phoenix Hotel checked out the report Wednesday night and found that it was a combination of burning logs, car headlights and perhaps vivid imaginations.

"The UFO at 4:15 a.m.," Zollo said, "yet they were able to give a detailed description of what they saw."

The officers checked the area from Routes 43 and 7 and discovered brightly burning logs, which were being fanned by the wind and casting a reddish glow. The Mt. Hope property nearby was contributed, but I am reasonably certain that the officers investigation proved that the sighting was false, Zollo concluded.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT

The three witnesses were proceeding north on Route# 7 at about 12:15 AM. Upon nearing the South Williamstown area they noticed a bright flash high in the sky. (This was also seen by a Mr. on Brooklyn Street at North Adams just before a power black-out affecting North Adams, Adams and Williamstown.)

Curiosity aroused, the trio noticed a glow in the field to their right (west) of the road and approximately 1 1/4 mile away. Reaching the intersection of Route #43 and #7, they turned east onto Route # 43 for about 1/4 mile and stopped to observe what appeared to be a crashed aircraft. The object they described was a bright reddish orange, dome-shaped with a bright reddish light. It was approximately 15 feet high and 50 feet in diameter. The object had 2 red lights, one on each side and appeared to be rotating counter-clockwise. In was on the ground about 150 yards from the road on the other side of the "Green River". Trees on the other side of the river obscured a full-clear view. After watching for a few minutes, they continued to Route #43 to the First house that had lights on. On the way they noticed red-glowing lights on the left of the road that "looked like the coals of a campfire". (These later were discovered to be a pile of logs left burning which were still glowing). They stopped at the lighted house and described their experience to its occupants. The witnesses then went to the house just glowing from a pile of burning logs and went back in the house. The witnesses then returned to the original scene. They first saw the dome-shaped object and noted that the "lights" were still there. They set off eastward on Route #7 to find a policeman. Suddenly, a very bright red-glowing object appeared several hundred feet ahead of them to the right of the road and paced the car which was doing 60 mph. The object

seemed to about a car's width off the ground and about 7 feet in diameter. 
It closed on thecar and paced it about 5 feet away. After a few seconds 
it disappeared - "like a light bulb going out".

Arriving at Williamstown they found a police officer and returned to the 
sitting areas. The police turned their spot-light on what now appeared 
to be glowing coals from a fire both the light would not reach the area. 
The officers told the told the witnesses to go home and that they would 
investigate. In the morning. The witnesses left, headed North on Route #7, 
and upon reaching the top of a hill they could still see the glowing red 
lights. They continued home. It was approximately 3:00 AM.

INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS

The witnesses did not tell the papers about their experience until 
January 23rd when they read about other UFO sightings in Western 
Massachusetts on January 22nd. They seemed sincere about what they 
had seen and their stories seemed to be essentially the same. They 
were very excited about being paced by the "Fireball".

The Williamstown police were very cooperative. They had investigated 
the car after the sighting and found that logs were being burned in 
the area on the date of the sighting. The police felt that the "Fire-
ball" chase was due to reflections on the car window and the young men's 
imagination. The felt that the actual facts were probably exaggerated 
by the young men.

CHAIRMAN'S EVALUATION

Investigator Jennings confirmed the report that logs had been burning 
in the sighting area on the night of the alleged sighting. This fact 
alone compromises part of the young men's account although it certainly 
does not explain the red-orange glowing object with red lights on each 
end that carried a rotating white light on its topside. It does not 
explain the round red-glowing object that paced their car at close 
range. He was the investigator's opinion that a legitimate UFO 
sighting took place and that the burning logs were incidental. The 
report in my own mind is inconclusive and valuable only in that it 
may contribute to the increase in UFO sightings that started mid-January 1967.
The description does fit that of many other better documented UFO 
reports.

                                                Respectfully submitted,

ATTENTION: Mr. Richard Hall
1 January 1967

The following is a detailed report concerning a UFO sighting by
two independent groups of witnesses on the night of 20 January 1967.
Group 1 consists of 4 adults who were driving in the Hyannis area.
Group 2 consists of 2 adults who were at home.

It is significant that a rash of UFO sightings was detected in Connecticut and other eastern seaboard points to this particular 6-point investigation. During my investigation, witnesses in
various sighting areas outside of this case were interviewed. It is
later via the readily available press that UFO were being sighted elsewhere in the New England area.

SUMMARY SIGHTING DOCUMENT:

GROUP #1 (Address: [redacted], Kissimmee Lodge(Driver) and [redacted])

Group #1 were proceeding SE on Washington Street for transportation to a local restaurant. While at a 500 SW 12th Street, a few houses audibly came upon a red/white/blue object along 500-800 feet and just off the road as a point of sighting to be about 400-500 feet away. They suddenly saw the object which was almost becoming to the lights was now seeming to be hovering. The object, to which they were apparently extending and color. Four distance lights formed a perfect trapezoid. Two red lights formed the top and two white lights formed the base. The witness was certain that the object was high above the ground. Only the driver felt that the red lights were blinking slightly. All were impressed by the large size of the individual lights and the apparent size of the object which was approximately 150 feet in diameter. They were compared to the color and brightness of a hot electric stove burner by the driver. A metallic glow was observed. While the car was stopped, the driver and passenger decided to make notes and memorialize. They ultimately pulled over to within 300-400 feet of the object. They decided to wait to be least to stay in the car which was a little less bright and noisy. Then abruptly the engine just barely died. They were pulsating off and on. The driver immediately looked to start the car but one light gave engine would only seem to be overlaying the battery. The object seemed to stare at the car again with something then ~25 feet was motionless. The driver had orange-like radiance. The object then stood still of the ground. Then the object began moving slowly and then stop as great speed in a SW direction. The driver was then able to start the car. They reported the object was quite warm and on. They noted the object a few degrees so close it was 12-15 miles and where they could see it better. Sometime later the object had been inside the house and street lights had not been visibly affected.

GROUP #2 (Address: [redacted])

More witnesses - about 5 number of lights to extremely low altitude while seeming to be moving very slowly in west of space and up to a point. One witness pulled over to view. She noticed the other vehicle lights. She called the other vehicle to view. Sighting was in a matter of two hours after first group. Lights were seen moving in the sky and gliding out in a similar pattern. It was noted that it was not a plane. Glow from white lights only collected until something greater was gathered. (Lights on particular landing point G. Clark-like calling on 4/21/68. Occurred sighting in New Mexico and others). Also

Lights although he could not make out an airplane's path behind was lighted. He stated that when he was 7-8 miles south of Sebring, he was driving away at an estimated distance of 300-400 feet. The [redacted] continued to watch the lights as-long-as they could as it.

Both girls made the lights appear as bright as a dime and larger than a dime. They saw a definite shape even though they apparently saw it closer and longer than 10 PH and the [redacted] did. Since the Group #2 sighting time was about 7:00 PH and the [redacted] path of Group #2 who were progressing NE along Legal Street which closely parallels Washington Street (12 West) continued, I claim that the seen object was one of the same objects between Group #1 and Group #2 was about 3 miles north-northwest.

EVALUATION:

1. WITNESS RELIABILITY (Groups Independent - No collaboration)

Group #1 - Excellent

The three young ladies were exceptionally intelligent and alert. Their school and public achievement record is well above average. I spent some time with them in order to get their independent view. They stated TWO had discussed the incident with a half-hour was spent talking out to the sighting site and having them recount the incident. However their time spent utilizing one on one especially prepared as a cross-to-check and. Further coverage organizing looks like a very good approach. I am fully convinced of the reliability of their account and the overall occurrence of their account.

Group #2 - Probably Good

I did not spend as much time with Group #2 [redacted] because of the investigation of the reliability of their report. I did have a 2-page supplementary data sheet. They were sincere and tried to help as much as they could. [rest of paragraph partially illegible]

II.  ADDITIONAL WITNESSES

A.   A spot-check of 7 residences in the Group #3 sighting area revealed that 3 families were out shopping and A. Faulkner were inside their homes during the sighting period. No other experience noted with problems with radio, TV or electric lights.

III. B.  ATTEMPT AT INVESTIGATION

A.   Astronomical = NEGATIVE: Venus had set about 8:05 PM EST. Quarter in the East and did not present significant configuration. Reported and was not in proper direction. No markers.

B.   Balloon      = NEGATIVE: Wind was blowing opposite direction to that of UFO departure from Group #1. Wind speed only 14 MPH. Abnormal lights.

C.   Aircraft     = IMPROBABLE

1)   Number, colors and configuration of lights do not correspond to the normal running lights of aircraft.

2)   Hovering attitude, extremely low altitude yet with no noticeable sound by Group #1 reported.

3)   A check with "Sig-Lite" Advertising Company indicated that their aircraft was grounded and has been in repair since January 1, 1967. No unusual aircraft had been sighted.

4)   I talked to the manager of the Avonong Municipal Airport, located about 3 miles SE of the Group #1 Sighting Point. Flying out of his field on that particular night, he saw nothing other than normal aircraft. He stated that he knew of nothing else that would present the reported configurations.

5)   In this case, however, with sound and lights as described, the sighting area was one of low landing approach to the airfield. The runway used for landing was Group (B/W) and places entering and leaving the field would be easy from the sighting area.

6)   I could not should NO information with an Army Reserve Officer the National Guard in 1/69 or the Westover AFB/Wright Patterson AFB. He confirmed with the said and stated that if the reported do have accurate, the sighting was extraordinary.

G.   All witnesses in both Groups except Mr. [redacted] were contacted. No unusual sighting, nothing to shake, nothing to add. Mr. [redacted] lights at close range but hesitation to speak in detail.

(Note: The reported Rpt phenomenon resulting in two paper falling to the object, one a color print, one a black & white print, lights, radio, radio full, etc. is not clear.)

IV. SPECIAL POINTS OF INTEREST

A. Sensing "Cause and Effect" Incidents

1) As Group #1 closed in on the slow-moving object and slowed down to stop, the object seemingly reacted to its close appearance in the area by turning around (while spinning down to a near stop).

2) When Group #1 stopped their car broadside to the hovering object and were scanning it with a 35 mm camera, the car's engine lights and radio failed except for the (It is possible that the warning lights and panel lights on. Were doing the same but were not seen as they are shielded from direct driver's view and might not be noticeable in the semblance of the situation).

3) As soon as the object moved off, Group #1 was able to start their car again. Lights (and horn) and radio functioned perfectly, consistent with many other reported.

4) The two red lights on the object were pulsating/blinking character light was pulsating.

5) The sighting next place during a pull-up of the sighting's distance in low register. This build-up was not known by the witness at the time, but was later in occupants in the least area in which was sightings only taking place. Group #1 reporting on this. No notice is being made on this.

V. CONCLUSIONS

With not consideration for the legible part of the object was a "uniform object" in the light of the sighting data collected and considered on the sighting. It is unorthodox and points strange to some than the. Sighting Characteristics of the object. However, neither Group #1 nor Group #2 reported the definite shape of the object. But to the first statement of the other Group #1 might say "crazy", had it not been too to alter their thinking. The sighting was a near-ground sighting and the fact that the investigation was a single-point investigation. This report would not have been known of or investigated by UFOB MASS.

The object moved on an erratic course, although it stayed in the same area of the sky. If you took out a half dollar and held it at an arm's length from your eye, you could have blocked the sight of this pulsating object during the entire hour that we watched it.

During the time that we watched it several planes flew overhead going in a westerly direction, although none of them appeared to notice the object or investigate it. One plane flew back to the west of us, going in a northerly direction. This plane had white lights on and one light that flashed red. However it was only a matter of a very short time before this plane and its lights were completely out of sight.

I don't see how the light that we saw could have been a star because of its erratic movement, and I don't think it could have been a plane, because the light emanating from this object was much too bright to be man-made.

When we left at 06:15 G.M.T. the object was a very faint pinpoint in the sky and fainter than most of the stars, although the pulsing was still quite obvious.

I don't know what this was. Perhaps you do. And if you do know what it was, I would like to know myself. We thought it might be a helicopter many miles away, hovering and moving around. However, the light was too intense for an object that had to be as far away as this object was from us.

When we first saw the object, it appeared to be of a globular shape, like a small top of a half sphere, and the colored lights seemed to be coming from around the periphery. When we looked at the object in the telescope, which was on a tripod, we could not absolutely determine the base of it. We did not have the telescope out when the object was closer and brighter, as it was when we first observed it.

(Continued from Page 1)

The most outstanding feature was two windows of gigantic pro-portions. No source of light was apparent, but the windows gave off a steady bright glow.

The object emitted no smoke, left no visible trail, did not change in brightness, shape, or color, and made no sound as it suddenly rose above the trees and gradually slid from sight, traveling parallel to its flight, 28 from east to west.

Whether to make a full report or to keep quiet to avoid ridicule and adverse publicity was a difficult decision to make. The obligation of a citizen to his government and to the general public, and early on the other possibilities, and early on the other possibilities, a call was made to the officer of the day at Otis Air Force Base.

"Was there anything flying last night?"

"There was nothing flying," the officer stated.

"Oh, yes there was!"

In reply to one remark, "You're going to think I'm crazy," the officer said, "Oh, no, I won't. We have a U.F.O. officer on duty here at the base for the purpose of handling all such reports. He will call you in the morning."

In order that the U.F.O. officer might determine whether or not a telephone interview would be worthwhile, the caller insisted on giving the officer the highlights of the sighting.

On Wednesday morning, a call came from a sergeant in the office of the lieutenant assigned to investigate U.F.O. reports. In the conversation lasting about 15 minutes, with every detail "might" examined, the sergeant agreed that if a sketch of the object were seen in the base, it would definitely aid further in the Air Force investigation.

In the past, the Air Force has denied any knowledge of the existence of U.F.O.'s, commonly called "flying saucers." More recently, however, with the number of sightings increasing significantly, official interest has been made public, and the Air Force has invited evidence to a private university for scientific investigation.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

When we got close to the object the car stalled it lights and our radio all went off at the same time. After this I tried to start the car twice while the object appeared to remain stationary. Thinking that the lights and radio would be drawing too much power from the battery of the car, I shut the light switch & the radio off. Then I tried to start the car again twice. It did not start. Next, the object in the sky seemed to start moving away. From us, I tried to start the car again & it immediately started, proving that it was not flooded. At this time I pulled up into Soanes' driveway & ran into the house to call my father. The car remained in good running condition for the rest of the night. Since we replaced the battery in our car 3 weeks ago, I do not believe that it was the car's fault. I had the clutch in at all times since I was pulling off to the side of the road to stop.

Jan 20, 1967

I was watching Walter Cronkite channel

I received a call from my daughter stating

that her & two friends saw a flying

saucer on Washington Street at the hoc white

on the way to pick up a friend at the

in this area -- The car stalled, lights went

out and radio went dead. My daughter said

it was heading this way, wanting to get

back to the concrete program. I cut this

conversation short, but never being positive

enough to observe a flying saucer, I did go

outside for a few minutes & looked at the

sky. Nothing out of the ordinary was seen

by me.

As we were driving west on Washington Street, I saw an object To The left of us in the sky, which at first appeared To be a Plane. As we approached it, I saw that it was Too large and Too low to be a Plane and called the attention of the other occupants To it. We pulled over To the side of the road and the car stalled. The object was moving in the same direction we were at first, then stopped for about a minute, Then flew off in the direction from which it came. When the object flew off, the car started again. The object made no noise, and it did not affect the street lights in the area.

PERSONAL SIGHTING ANALYSIS WORKSHEET

Please write a brief account in your own words concerning your sighting
of a UFO - the following information would be helpful:

What were you doing at the time of the sighting?
Where were you?
What did you actually say to your friends when you saw the UFO?
(If you remember) Describe your car, police car, or truck you were in?
What did you say and do when the car engine, radio and lights
failed? (Again, try to remember exactly what you said)
What made you think the object was not an aircraft, balloon or
some known object?
What did you think and do after the sighting?

When we saw the object, we were on our way to a basketball game,
driving west on Washington Street. I saw the object first, and when
I noticed that it was a UFO, I asked the other occupants what
they thought it was. Kidingly said that it was a UFO, and we pulled
over to the side of the road to get a better look at it. The car then stalled
and the lights went out. She said something about these objects
sometimes affect electronic outlets. She tried to start the car several
times unsuccessfully, and it started only when the object flew off.

I thought the object was not a plane because it was too large and
too low. I thought at first that it might be a helicopter because it
hovered in one position. For some time, but it didn't make any
noise as we would have heard a helicopter that low. After the
sighting we contacted Kim's parents, and later spoke with someone
from NICAP.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT

His children called Mr. [redacted] attention to a bright "object" in the West during an
electrical power failure in the Medfield area that commenced about 6:50 PM and terminated
at about 7:50 PM. The power loss was attributed to a short circuit somewhere. The "object"
appeared spherical through 7X50 binoculars.

Note: ** - Later, Mr. [redacted] stated that he sighted a white object in the South which had
an apparent diameter compared to 1/5 that of a full moon. It "sparkled like a sperkler"
and was moving West to East with a "bobbing motion". It appeared to be 1/4 mile away
at an estimated altitude of 200 feet.

SKETCH OF UFO(s)

REMARKS

Mr. [redacted] confessed to me that he had just finished reading the book "Incident at Exeter"
and was quite excited about his "UFO sighting" during a "power blackout". The first sighting
was most likely Venus. The second sighting, although exhibiting typical UFO motion, does
not contain enough data to make it an unknown. It most likely was an aircraft. It would
seem that Mr. Spang's sightings were influenced by the UFO book, electrical failure and
an overactive imagination.

UFO Spotted This Morning By Marlboro Woman

MARLBORO - Three unidentified flying objects (UFO) are still roaming around.

A Marlboro woman spotted one early this morning, at 2 a.m. circling the skies over her house on Grace Circle. She is Mrs. Bel-ty Huber.

Mrs. Huber was awakened at that time and glanced out of her bedroom after hearing a strange noise, not similar to that of an airplane.

She spotted a brilliant white object in the sky. The UFO stopped, the noise ceased and then started up again. Mrs. Huber said she noticed two red lights, one blinking and that it resembled a plane, with but one wing.

The object, unlike a plane, then form left to right several times, then took off and returned. She donned a coat and went out into her yard just in time to observe the UFO returning, south of her house. Again she noticed a brilliant white glow, the blinking red lights.

It probably was several thousand feet in the sky and Mrs. Huber stated that "it definitely was not an airplane."

BLUEBOOK

FLYING SAUCER? Sixteen-year-old
Richard Sr., Stacey, said he
was driving across the sky faster than a jet
when he saw what he describes as a UFO
in investigation.

On Tuesday DUNLEAVY
(Staff Writer) early Tuesday
morning, he was driving along
the north of a Sunset
Strip that is a major
thoroughfare in the Hollywood
area about 6 p.m. when

Marconi's UFO investigator,
Mel Riesel was on hand
and to examine the picture today. Marconi operations and
R received no other reports of
flying saucers in the Sun of

the youth said he saw a
strange and weird flying object
that was "blinding."

"Hey, what's that?" he
said.

Later, in a report to the
Sun in Sebring, he said the
object was traveling faster than
a jet and was "blinding."

This incident in the
Sebring area follows a similar
report in the Sebring area.

The handwritten notation "3/6/67" and "BLUEBOOK" appear in the top right corner of the document.

Upon arriving home, she phoned her sighting report into the police department. The police wrote me a letter informing me of the sighting and I telephoned the witness for basic details.

REMARKS:

Bright Object Streaks
Across Westfield Sky

WESTFIELD - Several local Mrs. Polly Gallo and Mrs. Eva Aldrich, both of Brookline Ave., reported seeing a bright object streaking across the sky Friday shortly after 2.

John Kelley, whose home is in Mrs. Gallo described the object as a metallic grapefruit with a "beautiful" color.

College, said he saw a metallic object in the sky about 2:30 p.m. He said there was something "round" of the meteor, which as he watched seemed to stop and quickly was unable to identify. Its speed was great.

"It wasn't a jet," he said, but possibly a meteor. Police were listening but were unable to confirm the object.

Kelley said he was listening to a radio station when he heard descriptions of a similar incident in the area of Bloomfield and had never said no one there had seen the object or received any calls.

Low rumbling when moved

[Rest of form partially filled with NA or illegible entries]

SIGHTING ACCOUNT:
See attached news-clip which investigators confirmed as an accurate account during interviewing
of witnesses.

Also: Triangle-shaped object moved with its blunt end or base forward and its pointed end or
apex trailing; Area was open countryside; Meat, vegetables and milk had frozen solid (This
was attributed to the UFO by the witnesses as earlier in the day the refrigerators were
normal. No proof that UFO had any connection); TV color did not return until the UFO left
the area and then only upon adjustment (Again), this was attributed by the witnesses to the
UFO and it could have been a coincidence although an E-M field could cause such interference).

[A hand-drawn sketch of a triangular shape with annotations "WHITE & LARGE" and "SMALL & WHITE"]

REMARKS:
Investigators were impressed with sincerity and seeming validity of witnesses and the sighting.
They obtained basic data but failed to have each witness fill out forms and draw sketches
independently. Also, no follow-up of other alleged witnesses was attempted. Mr. Rogelund of
the Springfield, Mass. Planetarium had obtained the negatives and promised to send NICAP any
results of his evaluation via a leading photographic corporation. All-in-all, probably a good
sighting but I was not pleased with the investigation as many details were absent. Distance
involved in out-of-state travel; failure of NICAP-CONN to investigate; and, priority of sightings
in our state negated further follow-up. If negatives are significant, follow-up by NICAP-CONN
could be highly desirable.

N. Woodstock Woman Avows
UFO Froze 2 Refrigerators

NORTH WOODSTOCK -- Four persons have reported sighting a large, triangular-shaped, unidentified flying object that they say hovered over their home for several minutes.

This sighting was made Friday, according to Mrs. Doris Rowe of Beech Lake Road, Mrs. Rowe said that her son, William, 13, and her son-in-law, Richard McGuire, 32, were outside in front of the garage at about 5:30 p.m. working on their car when they looked up and saw the object hovering over them.

They saw three white lights at each corner of the triangular-shaped craft. They were as bright as automobile headlights, Mrs. Rowe said. Mrs. Rowe, who was joined later by her daughter, Mrs. Nancy McGuire, went into the house to get his camera as soon as he saw the thing.

He came out and took several pictures with his 35 mm camera.

She said that his camera is a good piece of equipment. She said and that his photos later showed the lights, but not the triangular shape of the craft. McGuire works at Knox Glass in Dayville.

Mrs. Rowe said that the craft hovered silently over head for about two minutes, then moved over what she calls her south field -- in a southwesterly direction where it hovered a little while longer.

She noted that the lights from the craft were so bright that the four could easily make out the silhouette of the craft. "I didn't make a sound until it began to move. Then it made a low rumbling noise -- something like an airplane but not quite the same."

The housewife said that the craft craft hovered was not a helicopter or conventional aircraft. "It hovered without a sound, about 1,500 feet or so, and was -- although its height was hard to determine."

Her son took several photos and then ran into the house for a fresh roll of film. He returned and took a few more pictures. Mrs. Rowe said.

"I found both of my refrigerators -- I have one in the kitchen and another in the pantry -- frozen solid after I went into the house to prepare supper. I mean the whole refrigerator -- not just the freezer. I can't understand it, since the control was on the 'low' setting. I can't understand how it could get cold enough in the main compartment outside the freezer to freeze the items so solidly."

No TV Color

She also said that the color in her color television set went off, as the craft hovered over the house. "The kids were looking at the TV just about when the thing appeared, and they told us the color went off and only black and white pictures were being received. This was in the middle of the program, too -- not during a station break."

Mrs. Rowe said that several neighbors also place reported sighting the strange craft. "It's all kind of scary," she said.
