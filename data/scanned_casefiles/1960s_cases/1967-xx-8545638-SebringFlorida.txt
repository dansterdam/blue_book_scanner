Input for the Record: 25 Jan 67

United States Air Force
Unit Investigating U. F. O.'s
The Pentagon
Washington, D. C.

Gentlemen:

I live at the central part of the city of Sebring, Florida. At approximately 6:15 P.M. on January 25 my wife was driving home from our hotel and she saw a bright, pulsating object through the house.

She came into the house and spoke to me of this, and although at first I didn't believe it, I finally went outside to look at it.

The object was approximately 150 west of due south, and about 15° above the horizon. It was rounded object in the sky by far exceed for the flares which were being dropped on the bombing range, which is east by north of us. Of course, it was much brighter than the moon, but it was brighter than the brightest star.

I see it, too. The object pulsed white, red, and then either blue or green. We could not be sure which. The pulsations were not a constant frequency, but were very apparent.

We called out our neighbors, Ann Kahn, and our other neighbors, also saw it. By this time, several autos were stopped in the street to telescope and inspect the object, all of which were just as amazed as we were. The object was seen at its disappoint and got no brighter than the brightest star. It would sometimes move out of the field in approximately one minute. When it would disappear, it only over a tree several hundred yards away. We could then move off in an easterly or westerly direction and line it up over another tree. This, of course, led me to believe that the object was quite distant at the time we were taking these particular observations.

I wanted to provide this information to your department for its file, as I am sure you may be interested in this happening.

Sincerely yours,

"Glowing Object Trailed Car,
North Adams Trio Reports"

A shining object, which the witnesses described as "glowing" 
was sighted from a car Saturday night near Williamstown, 
Mass. The incident was reported by three North Adams residents.

The other thing, according to the report, was that the object 
appeared to be about seven to eight feet tall. It was shaped like 
an elongated oval and had a glowing, silvery color. The object 
was first sighted on the ground about 500 feet away from the car 
and then paced the car for a while, staying about the same 
distance away.

The report states that the object seemed to be "following" the
car. It disappeared after a short time but reappeared again 
about 50 seconds later. The object was then about 200 feet 
away and about 10 feet off the ground. It disappeared again after 
a few seconds.

The witnesses were two college students, one of whom is a 
student at North Adams State College, and a third companion. 
They were returning to North Adams from Williamstown when the
incident occurred around 10 p.m. Saturday. The sighting was 
"very bright", they said, and the object seemed to be about seven
or eight feet tall and ovally-shaped.

Joseph Dente, a student at Williams College, said he and two 
companions saw the object on the hill on their way back to North 
Adams. Dente said the object was "very bright" and appeared to 
be following their car. He said it disappeared and then reappeared
several times. Dente said the sighting was "very unusual" and the 
object was about 500 feet away at one point.

The Pittsfield Police Department, which received the report, said 
no explanation has been found for the incident.

Police Report UFO 
Sighting Caused 
By Burning Logs

Williamstown Police Chief Jr. 
Joseph Callahan reports that 
four unidentified citizens in
formed him about a strange UFO
sighting near the Williamstown
area. The UFO sightings were made
at about 7:30 P.M. on January 22,
1957.

The chief, who did not know
anything about the incident until
the citizens reported it, stated that
the persons were burning logs and
suddenly saw the logs take the
shape of a UFO. The chief explained
that the persons were certain they
were seeing a UFO which hovered
over the area for several minutes.

Reports of the sightings were
made to the chief's office the next
day, January 23, 1957. The persons
reporting the incident are local
citizens of Williamstown and were
at work at the time.

Letters To The Transcript
Convinced Object
Was A Real U.F.O.

According to the report of two 
Williamstown citizens, they ob-
served a strange object in the sky
on January 22, 1957 at approxi-
mately 7:30 P.M. These citizens
have been reliable members of the
community for many years and 
appear to be sincere in their report. 
They must have been convinced
that what they saw was a real 
U.F.O. for they took the trouble
to report it to the Williamstown
Police Chief the following day.

The chief stated that the ob-
ject was caused by the burning
logs, but from the description
given by the witnesses, it ap-
peared to be more than just
burning logs. The witnesses stated
that the object was hovering over
the area for several minutes. Why
would burning logs hover in the
sky? This seems rather doubtful.

The citizens reporting this 
incident have been described as
reliable members of the commu-
nity. Therefore, I feel that their
report should be given serious
consideration and not just dis-
missed as being caused by burn-
ing logs.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

UFO REPORT

NICAP MASS INVESTIGATOR: *
DATE OF INVESTIGATION: 29 January 1967

SIGHTING DATE: 18 January 1967
SIGHTING TIME: 12:15 AM
SIGHTING LOCATION: South Williamstown, Mass.

WITNESSES: (1) Mr. ********* (Age 21)
           Springfield, Massachusetts
(2) Mr. ********* (Age 22)
           (c/o Phoenix Hotel, N.Adams, Mass.)
(3) Mr. ********* (Age 22)
           Brooklyn Street, North Adams, Mass. (saw flash of light before power failure same time above trio sighted UFO)

SIGHTED ACCOUNT:
The three witnesses were proceeding north on Route 7 at about 12:15 AM. Upon reaching the South Williamstown area they spotted a bright flash on the sky. (This was also seen by a Mr. ********* at his home in North Adams Adams and Williamstown.) Subsequent to the flash, they noticed a power blackout affecting North Adams, Adams and Williamstown.

Guessing that this was related to the glow in the field to their right (west) of the road and approximately 1/4 mile away. Reaching the glow, they discovered a circular object, approximately 50 feet in diameter, off the ground and hovering approximately 3 feet above. The object appeared to be a bright reddish orange in color and dome-shaped, with a white dome on top. It was estimated to be 35-40 feet high. The object had a red light on the top which spun rapidly, and another white light on the bottom that seemed to be rotating at a slower speed. Trees on the other side of the frozen stream on which the object was hovering, appeared to be bending away from the object as if pushed by a strong wind. The object suddenly dimmed and shot away in an upward direction at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight. The witnesses then resumed their journey and continued on the route. Subsequent to this, evidence was found of damaged power lines and burned poles, and the citizens of the three towns were without power for two hours. The witnesses stated that the object and noted that the sight was still "very bright". Suddenly, a very bright light seemed to come from the rear of the object which obscured the entire area, then the object shot up and right of the road and passed the car which was doing 60 mph. The object then disappeared.

1/13/67 - WILLIAMSTOWN, MASS.

SHEET TWO

It seemed to be about a car's width or width for the ground and about 7 feet in diameter. It closed on the car and pointed at it. This seemed to have a glowing light on it. After a few seconds it disappeared.

Arriving at Williamstown they found a police officer and returned to the sight to point out the area. The witnesses then reported that an oval object with a glowing light on it appeared to be hovering over the area and then took off at a rapid rate of speed. The police were very cooperative. They had investigated the sighting and found that there were more than six witnesses. The police felt that the details of the sighting were essentially the same and the young men who were eyewitnesses seemed to them to be essentially the same. They continued home. It was approximately 3:00 AM.

INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS:
The witnesses did not see the object again after January 23rd when they read about other UFO sightings in the newspapers. Their sighting on January 22nd. The witnesses seemed about what they had seen and their stories seemed to be essentially the same. They felt that the details of their sighting were significant although it did not last long.

The Williamstown police were very cooperative. They had investigated the sighting and found that there were more than six witnesses. The police felt that the details of the sighting were essentially the same.

CHAIRM'N'S EVALUATION:
The investigators reported that the sighting appears to be a legitimate UFO sighting. This fact also does not explain the red-orange glowing object with red lights on each side. It does not entirely correspond to the sighting reported by the witnesses. It does not conclusively prove the existence of a UFO. In general, the investigator's opinion that a legitimate UFO sighting occurred is inconclusive and valuable only in that it represents one investigator's judgment of this case in 1967. The sighting is not well documented, and it appears to be part of many other better documented UFO reports.

Respectfully submitted,

WVBJECT: UFO Sighting(s) - Hernando, Florida 1/20/67
DJFTEJ 22 January 1967
FROM: RAYMOND B. FOWLER
CSA RESEARCH STAFF MEMBER
TO: RJCAP, Washington, D.C.

APPRQVEE BY: DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK

The following is a detailed report compiled from information obtained by a CBS news team in Hernando, Florida on 1/20/67. The information was given to me by a member of the CBS team.

On the evening of 1/20/67 at approx. 11:30 PM, a number of residents of Hernando, Florida observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky. The UFO was described as being elliptical in shape with a diameter of 50-60 ft. It was reported to have been orange in color and to have pulsed or flashed at irregular intervals. The object was said to have hovered silently over a nearby pine forest for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight.

Several witnesses said they were awakened from sleep by a bright light shining into their homes. When they looked outside, they saw the large orange object hovering over the trees. One witness, a 'Mrs. C.', said the UFO was only about 200 yards from her home and that it made no sound as it hovered. Another witness, a 'Mr. N.', said he was driving on the highway when he noticed the object and that it accelerated at a fantastic speed when it left the area.

REGIONAL RECORD:

SUMMARY SEKAMIG ACCOUNT: 

Group A-3 (DELETED) reported that on January 6, 1967, they observed a group of 4 lights in the sky near Sebring, Florida. The lights were described as white in color, appearing about the size of a pea, and they made no sound. The witness stated that the lights were observed for approximately 1 to 2 seconds and suddenly disappeared. The witness reported the incident to the local police department.

The text continues with further details about the incident, including information about the witness, time, location, and observations. There is no mention of any photographic evidence being provided.

Reams as though he could not make out just what the objects were before they flew away or to the southeast, or whatever they did, they would take on a different appearance, as shown on his sketch of 500 feet of 1000 feet, that he could not make out what they were doing, that whether he was dreaming or not, he sincerely is convinced that he did see something that was not of this world.

VELOCITY: 
055-110 knots

EVALUATION:

1. INTERIM STATEMENT - PRELIMINARY. Intraproject Evaluation: The data collected provides an interesting account, however, additional data would be required to resolve whether or not this was a legitimate UFO sighting.

2. PROBABLE CAUSE: The object(s) seen were possibly: 1. Conventional aircraft which appeared unusual due to weather conditions or other factors. 2. Misidentification of known objects.

The sighting was exceptionally circumstantial and lacking in physical evidence. While the observer appears to be sincere, more data is required to determine the true nature of the sighting.

1/20/67 -- MEMORANDUM

II.  ADDITIONAL WITNESSES:

A. A spot-check of 7 witnesses in the case indicates they are reputable citizens, widely known in their community, and their accounts are consistent with each other regarding the object.

III. ATTEMPT AT IDENTIFICATION:

A. ASTRONOMICAL - NEGATIVE: Venus had set about 10:30 P.M. and did not re-appear.

B. Balloon - NEGATIVE: Used was a weather balloon, but speed and drift not consistent.

C. Aircraft - IMPROBABLE:
1) Number, color and configuration of lights do not match normal aircraft.
2) Hovering, stationary, and erratic flight not normal for aircraft.
3) Craft observed for over 30 minutes, much longer than normal aircraft flight.

4) Lights so bright that normal aircraft lights would not correspond and craft would not correspond to the object, but would be easily recognized as an aircraft.

(Note: The expanded Ball Phenomena identified in this report indicates that the object was not a normal aircraft. The witnesses described the object in detail and their accounts are consistent with each other.)

2/20/67 - SEBRING, MASS.

IV. SPECIAL POINTS OF INTEREST:
A. Sebring Florida incident - January 24, 1967

1) A Group A2 jet was in the area, the moving object was noted approaching the plane as it was identified by the tower and pilot as a rotating, pulsing UFO. (Approximately 30 minutes duration)

2) When Group A2 jet was approaching to check the object, the object started moving rapidly away from the jet and the jet was unable to close the gap. The object was seen by the tower, ground crew, and the pilot of the jet. (Approximately 10 minutes duration)

3) As the jet closed in, the object would suddenly accelerate up, down, or sideways at a very high rate of speed. This was noted on more than one occasion with the object disappearing and reappearing in a different location. (Approximately 10 minutes duration)

4) The two jets were unable to get a constant locked on with their radar on the object.

5) The director of the airport stated that he personally saw the object and it was a large, intensely bright light that would suddenly accelerate and disappear. He said it was unlike anything he had ever seen before.

V. COMMENTS:
When the object was considered to be a threat to the area by the USAF, the jets were scrambled and the object was pursued. However, the jets were unable to get a solid lock on the object and it was able to accelerate and disappear at will. This incident was considered to be among the most credible and intriguing of the recent UFO sightings reported.

The object moved on an erratic course, although it moved in the same area of the sky. If you took out a half dollar and held it at an arm's length from your eye, you could have blocked the sight of this pulsating object during the entire hour that we watched it.
As we watched it, we saw it several planes. Now overhead going in a westerly direction. Although none of them appeared to notice the object, as they were going in a northerly direction. This plane had its lights on and went on. However, it was only in sight for a short time before the plane and its lights were completely out of sight.
I don't see how the light that we saw could have been a star because of its erratic movement, and I don't think it could have been a plane, to be man-made.
When we left at 06:15 G. M. T. the object was a very faint spot in the sky and farther than most of the stars, although the pulsing was still quite obvious.
I don't know what this was. Perhaps you do. And if you can explain what it was, I should like to know myself. We thought it might be a flying saucer, but the light was too close for an object that was flying away, hovering and moving all around. However, the object was far away as against being too close for an object that had to be as far away as this one.

Very sincerely yours,

ADDENDUM IV
SUBJ: CASE HISTORY (10/17/66)

"This authorities check "fine" sighting.
Onset buzzed by Flying Saucer"

ONSET FLYING SAUCER as recorded from eye-witness reports. The object, which moved very slowly, was reported as being about the size of a telephone pole at a distance of approximately 2,000 feet. It was approximately 150 feet off the ground and traveled in a straight but erratic pattern. It had a metallic silver body and appeared to have portholes or windows. The object emitted a bright white light and changed color from white to red. The movement was slow and erratic with no discernible pattern of flight.
This sighting was investigated by the local police and was considered an authentic UFO sighting. The object was observed for a period of thirty minutes by several independent witnesses, some of whom were trained observers. Its existence and the details of the sighting were confirmed by the authorities.

Country: Mass.
NAME: MARSHALL, LT. COL., USAF

NOV: 1964

Flying Saucer
The object, reported by several observers, was very large and outstanding. Its motion was that of two windows of gigantic proportions. No sound, no smoke, but the windows pave blue reddish in color.
The object, which emitted no smoke, hovered above the treetops and then suddenly rose straight up silently and with tremendous speed. It flew towards the east to west.
Whether to make a full report or remain silent was difficult decision to make. The object was witnessed by several persons but the general public seemed to be skeptical of such reports.

The officer of the day at Otis Air Force Base was notified but found nothing flying. It was decided that there was nothing flying so no report was made.

The object the car stalled. Lights and our radio all went off at the same time. After this I tried to start the car twice while the object remained. To do this I tured the ignition switch but the radio would be drawing too much power from the battery of the car, I shut the light switch the radio off. Then I tried to start the car again twice. It did not start. Next, the object began to move away. I tried to start the car again immediately but it would not. At this time I pulled up into my grandmother's driveway. I had to call my father. The car remained in good order, the battery was not drained, since we had no trouble starting it later. At this time I believe that it was the car's fault. I had the cables to the side of the road to stop.

"I was watching a 'walter creek' craft at approximately between 6:30 - 7:00 p.m. on 3/26/67. I received a call from my daughter stating that her two friends saw a flying saucer on the West Chester Street in the vicinity. They came out just in time to see the craft stall, then it fired up again and out of sight. Nothing out of the ordinary by my estimate."

PERSONAL HISTORY - CONTACT SYNOPSIS

- Please strike a match so that I can see in your own writing what occurred as a UFO - sighting.

What were you doing at the time of the sighting?
What did you actually say to your friends when you saw the UFO?
What did you say and do when the car stopped, radio and lights went out?
What have you withheld and do not wish to discuss because of doubt and uncertainty or some known objection?
Just what did you see and do after the sighting?

Messrs. ___ picked me up at my home about 6:30. We were traveling down Washington Street when __ said, "What's that?". I turned and saw a bright, luminous object in the sky above. It appeared to be at a distance of about a mile. There was a light very different from any aircraft light I have ever seen. She got very excited and said, "It must be a UFO or flying saucer". At that moment, the car lights and radio went out. We all became quite concerned. Then the object began moving rapidly toward us, very close. I was scared and I refused to get out of the car. We had just passed the Post Office and the car started.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

As we were driving north on Washington STREET, I saw an object to the left of the sky, which at first appeared to be a plane. As we approached it, I saw it was not a plane and the less to be a plane and called the attention of the other occupants to it. We pulled over to the side of the road and the car stopped. The object was moving in the same direction we were at first, then stopped for about a minute. Then flew off in the direction from which it came. When the object flew off, the thing that seemed strange about it was that it made no noise, and it did not affect the street lights in the area.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be a narrative description of a UFO sighting.

Project Blue Book was a study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force from 1952 to 1969. This text seems to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text produced by the OCR system:

Please verify a report covering an unidentified flying object, Sebring, Florida, on August 7, 1967.

What were you doing when this sighting occurred?
My wife and I were driving on Highway 27, returning home to Sebring, Florida, from Avon Park, Florida, approximately 8:00 P.M. on August 7, 1967.

What did you see?
As we were driving, we saw an object in the sky. Can you describe the object?
The object was stationary, hovering in the sky, about 10 to 15 degrees from the horizon. It was round, and white in color, and appeared to be metallic. It seemed to be about the size of a car. What did you think it was?
We thought it was an aircraft or some type of UFO. Why did you think it was a UFO?
Because of the way it was hovering and the way it disappeared. It did not seem to move like an aircraft.

What did you do when you saw the object?
We pulled the car over to the side of the road to get a better look at it. The car then stalled and the lights went out. Did you see or hear anything else?
We heard a humming sound coming from the object. She tried to start the car several times but it would not start.

What happened then?
I thought the object was not a plane because it hovered and then disappeared rapidly down to the low horizon and the law. I thought at first that it might be a missile because it moved so rapidly, but it did not seem to be a missile either, and it hovered in one position for some time. We did not see or hear a helicopter, but we had heard a helicopter that was out in that area earlier.

UFO SUMMARY REPORT FORM
Sighting Date: 16 February 67
Location: Sebastian, Fla.
Time: From 7:05 to 7:10 PM EST
Weather: A little haze
Witnesses: 
Mr. [Redacted]
Apparent Size: Cf. star x 1 Cf. full moon Smaller Est. real size: ?
Elevation: 45° Est. Altitude: ? Direction: seen W moved E to W
Color: Yellow-white-Orange Sound: None heard Shape: Light source
UFO passed in front of NA at NA ft/ml - passed behind Trees at 150 ft/ml
SIGHTING ACCOUNT
His children called him to the bright "object" in the West during an established duration of 5 minutes. This turned out to be a silvery-metallic spherical object of about 6-650 feet and seemed to float or hover and then vanished somewhere. The "object" appeared spherical through 7x50 binoculars.
Note: Mr. [Redacted] compared his sighting to a similar sighting by himself and another witness on 3/5 that had an estimated altitude of 2000 feet.
SKETCH OF UFO(S)
REMARKS
Mr. [Redacted] confessed to me that he had just finished reading the book "Incident at Exeter" and was quite excited about his "UFO fighting" during a power blackout. The first sighting was not contained enough data to make it an unknown. It most likely was an aircraft. It would seem that Mr. Sprinklestein's fighting were influenced by the UFO book, a certain imagination.

UFO Spotted
This Morning By
Marlboro Woman
"Those brilliant flying objects (UFO) are still around - or ?"
A Marlboro woman spotted one early this morning, at 2:25 a.m., circling the skies over her house on Grove Circle, said Mrs. Bel- HUBEL.
Mrs. Huber was awakened at that time and looked out of her bedroom on hearing a strange noise, not at all similar to that of a plane.
She spotted a brilliant white object in the sky. The UFO stopped, the noise ceased and then started again, Mrs. Huber said she heard two distinct whirring sounds, not like one that would emanate from a plane, but "one with a dip" and she feels "it resembled a plane, with one big one."
The object, unlike a plane, new from a great several times, then took off and return- ed. She found "it coal and went out into her yard just to observe the UFO returning, south of the house. Again she noted a brilliant white glow, the blinking red lights and felt it was definitely not an airplane."

UFO REPORT

Sebring, Florida

Date: 16 MAR 1967

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object

Summary: UFO Sighting - On the evening of March 16, 1967, at about 8:00 p.m., Mr. Robert Ward was observed a large, brightly lighted object in the sky over his home. The object appeared to be hovering and then began to move rapidly to the north-west. At the same time, Mr. Ward's dog began to bark and act very nervous. The object was described as round, with bright lights around the entire periphery. The sighting lasted for about 15 minutes.

When Mr. Ward first observed the object, he immediately called his wife and son to also observe it. All three members of the family watched the object for the duration of the sighting. Mr. Ward stated that the object appeared to be about twice the size of a full moon and was very brilliantly lighted, with the lights seeming to pulsate. At one point, the object appeared to be surrounded by a hazy glow. The object then moved rapidly to the north-west and was soon out of sight.

Mr. Ward stated that he had never seen anything like this before and that he was quite startled by the sighting. He felt that the object was under intelligent control and not an airplane or any other known type of aircraft. This report is being forwarded for your information.

Witness was driving approximately east when she noticed a bright flash to her right. She saw a large red-orange glowing mass approaching at high speed. It appeared to be just a few blocks ahead of her and at tree-top level. She was driving in a residential section. Upon arriving home, she phoned for a sighting report into the police department. The police department contacted the witness for basic details.

* - Assume that UFO was a fireball although no trail was seen or falling sparks. It would have to be extremely bright to be seen in broad daylight. The apparent size, altitude and distance are understandable. Without a reference point, such data are not attainable.

Bright Object Streaks
Across Westfield Sky

WESTFIELD - Several local residents, including Rev. Davis Gallo and Mrs. Eva S. Aldrich, or 20 Court St., Aldrich, saw an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Westfield Friday evening.

According to Mrs. Aldrich, her husband first spotted the object while they were out for a walk. He called her attention to it and she saw the object which appeared to be metallic in nature and was traveling very fast.

"It was moving so fast that I couldn't tell much about the size or shape or anything," she said. "It just streaked by as fast as you could blink an eye."

She said the object seemed to be an intense white color and had a trail of light behind it. "It was just a bright streak as it went by," she added.

Mrs. Aldrich said her husband first spotted the object at about 7 p.m. The site of the sighting was near the intersection of Union and Mill streets in Westfield.

A spokesman at Barnes Airport confirmed receiving a report of an unidentified object over the Westfield area at about 7 p.m. Friday evening. However, he said they had no further details on the sighting.

The Federal Aviation Agency also received a report of the sighting, but could provide no further information.

DAC SIGHTING REPORT FORM

DATE OF REPORT: 25 Feb 67

LOCATION: Sebring, Conn. (Turnpike Road)

TIME: From 5:20 PM to 5:45 PM EST

WEATHER: Clear - Many stars

NARRATOR: [REDACTED]

Age: 25 Occupation: Student Address: Turnpike Rd. *

and wife: 32 H.S Student

Apparent: Dir: N. of NE Alt: Full Moon. Larger

Duration: 25 - 30 MIN EST. Altitude: 1000 FEET Direction: NORTHEASTERLY to SE

Object: 2 white round lights; 3 white sounds; None low rumbling when moved

Also: Triangle-shaped object moved with its blunt end or base toward and its pointed end or apex trailing. Area was open countryside; Meat, vegetables and milk had frozen solid.(This was attributed to the UFO as an 'extreme change in temperature or energy was released in the day the refrigerators were thawing. Investigators concluded it could have been a coincidence).

Investigators were impressed with sincerity and seeming validity of witnesses and the sighting. Also, no follow-up of other alleged witnesses was attempted. Mr. Rogelund of the Sprinfield Mass. Planetarium had obtained the investigators and provided to send NICAP any results of this value of photographic cooperation. All-in-all, probably a good sighting. The Air Force was pleased with details provided in NICAP-CONN report and no further follow-up could be made. If negative are significant, follow-up by NICAP-CONN would be desirable.

Transcription of the text in the document:

N. Woodstock Woman Avows
UFO Froze 2 Refrigerators
NORTH WOODSTOCK - Mrs. 
Pauline Rowe said today that a 
gigantic UFO that hovered over 
her garage last Friday night 
shaped "like a huge lozenge" 
froze the contents of two refrig-
erators in her home. 
"The strange thing was made Fri-
day night about 9:45," said Mrs. 
Rowe. "My son, William, 14, and 
I were standing outside the garage
looking up when we saw the 
strange craft."
"It was a huge lozenge-shaped ob-
ject and it seemed to be made of 
metal. It hovered over the garage 
at a height of about 50 ft. for about 
10 minutes. Then it moved up and 
down and back and forth. We 
could see the bright lights from 
the craft. Then it seemed to just
disappear."

Mrs. Rowe said that the camera
she was using is a good one, but 
the lights on the craft were so 
bright the craft could hardly be 
seen in the pictures.
"It wasn't until later that night 
that we found the contents of two 
refrigerators in my kitchen were 
frozen solid," Mrs. Rowe said. 
"The things in the freezer compart-
ments were frozen, but not quite the
same."
The housewife said that the solid
freezing of the contents of the two 
refrigerators was not due to a power 
failure, as there was no interruption
in the electricity. "I'd say - although 
it's hard to determine -  that the 
UFO had something to do with 
it," she added.
Her son, William, a sophomore at 
Northampton High School, said he 
also saw the strange craft. "It was 
a huge lozenge-shaped thing and 
it seemed to be made of metal. 
When it hovered over the garage 
it looked like something from an-
other world," the youth said.
