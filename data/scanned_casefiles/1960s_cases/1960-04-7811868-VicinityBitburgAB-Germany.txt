The Wallops Island UFO

Perhaps the most spectacular (and short-lived) UFO in history appeared at 6:55 p.m. E.S.T. on April 1, 1960, along the east coast. A bright-yellow streak of fire shot up from the horizon into the eastern sky and slowly changed into a huge zigzag pattern. With the streak of fire appeared a large reddish sphere, reported by some observers to be as large as the full moon and many times brighter than a planet. Visible along the entire eastern seaboard, the brilliant object slowly moved eastward, followed by a trail of greenish sparks. While still at high altitude over the Atlantic Ocean, it suddenly vanished—as though it had simply taken off into outer space. Switchboards in eastern cities were jammed as witnesses called newspapers, universities, and nearby observatories to report a comet, a fireball, or a flying saucer.

Newspapers immediately printed a full explanation of this April Fool's Day apparition: a scheduled but unannounced rocket launching from Wallops Island, Virginia. The yellow fire was debris from the rocket, reflecting the rays of the setting sun; contrary winds in the upper atmosphere produced the zigzag form. The luminous globe was a full-scale model of the Echo satellite—an inflated balloon 100 feet in diameter, carried aloft by the rocket. Dry powder escaping though holes in the balloon produced the greenish tail.

The object had "vanished" when the balloon fell back into the earth's shadow and was thus no longer visible.

Although the newspapers published a full explanation within a day or two, some saucer enthusiasts continued to treat the apparition as a mystery. In its Special Bulletin for May the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (see Chapter xm) included the incident under "Recent UFO Sightings" and described the object as a bright, pulsating UFO that hovered in one spot for several minutes before it began to move. Not until three months after the launching did the organization concede (UFO Investigator, July-August, 1960) that the UFO of April 1 was "probably" the giant balloon sent up from Wallops Island.

On August 12, 1960, the counterpart of this balloon went into orbit and became the satellite Echo, which is still circling the earth, shining like a star of the first magnitude near dawn or sunset.

No Case (Information Only)                                   7 April 1960
                                                           Mozambique, East Africa

On April 7 at Mozambique, West Africa a round orange object,
which emitted a glow landed, and four little men emerged and ran into
the woods--then their craft exploded with large concussions. Prior to
the landing of the object, it made a loud whistling sound. The
witnesses numbered in the hundreds, however no additional report has
come as to the fate of the little men.

                                                        Lexington, Massachusetts

On April 13 at Lexington, [redacted] noted Boston area newscaster, along with his wife and family watched a bright white UFO sweep across the sky at 8:40 P.M. The UFO moved from west to east, then made a gradual turn to the north over the eastern horizon. Stuart checked with observatories and ruled out the possibility of a satellite before reporting the sighting on [redacted] TV. While checking, he learned that Fort Monmouth, N.J. radar had tracked a UFO at about the same time—apparently the same object.
