December 6 1966

Dear Sir:

On the third of December I sighted what I think was a U.F.O.

I am 13 an write this report after much deliberation.

I live in Beachwood New Jersey. I sighted the U.F.O.s in Beachwood.

On Saturday evening December third, a friend of mine, myself sighted what we believe were U.F.O.s. The time was 10:55 pm. We sighted, at first, what we thought was an airplane. It didn't seem to be moving at all. We watched it for about two minutes then it darted away upward and to the south. It was a red flashing light in the south west sky when we first saw it.

We probably wouldn't have thought anything of it, but from the same spot where we first saw the first one two more appeared. These were headed North in two opposite directions from which the first one had left. There were two of them, they seemed smaller than the first one. They were bright silver. They were at a high altitude and were moving very fast. Of one thing I'm sure is we weren't airplanes they were going too fast. They stopped once then continued North until they were out of sight.

I hope I haven't wasted your time. And I hope that this report is helpful.

Sincerely Yours,
Beachwood New Jersey

Dear Sir,

On the third of December I sighted three UFOs. On the sixth I reported them to your office, Project Blue Book.

I received and filled out a form and returned it to you.

Now, five months later I am still interested in what it was I saw that evening. I am writing this letter to you to find out if your department found out anything more after I returned your report.

I would appreciate any information you could tell me about my sighting. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

MAY 23 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Reference your recent letter requesting Air Force conclusions on your particular observation of December 3, 1966.

Although a positive identification has not been made, the description you provided is consistent with that of an aircraft sighting. There is heavy air traffic in the area. The Lakehurst Naval Air Station is continually engaged in air training exercises around the Lakehurst area. Both aircraft and helicopters fly out of Lakehurst.

Again, I want to stress that we are unable to make a positive identification of the objects observed, but after detailed study it does appear aircraft could have been responsible for the sighting.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
