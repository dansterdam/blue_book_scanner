The image contains two photographs. The first is a compass-like diagram with various directional labels. The second is a landscape scene depicting a person standing in a desert-like environment with mountains in the background.

TEXT FOUND IN THE DOCUMENT:

THE POSITION OF THE OBSERVER WAS AS SHOWN BELOW.   A COMPASS ROSE INDICATES THE DIRECTION OF THE NEAREST TOWNS AND OBJECTS OF SIGNIFICANT VISUAL REFERENCE.  THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED AT 0305L AND WAS UNDER OBSERVATION FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES.  IT MOVED SLOWLY FROM SOUTH TO SOUTH-SOUTHWEST, AND REVERSED DIRECTION, MOVING STRAIGHT NORTH.  DURING THE OBSERVATION IT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY FOR PERIODS OF TIME, THEN MOVED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED.  THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS DISC-SHAPED WITH A GLOWING LIGHT ON TOP AND A BRIGHT LIGHT UNDERNEATH.  DURING THE OBSERVATION THE LIGHTS REMAINED CONSTANT AND UNBLINKING.
