TO     ATIC Wright-Patterson AFB

Attached reports were received too late to make a comprehensive
investigation. However, we did verify that a weather balloon was
released at 2322 MST by WSMR Western Aeromed. Local wind conditions
could have placed this balloon in the area the sighting was reported.

AIR 17(U)

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SYSTEM BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE THAT APPROXIMATES THE ANGULAR MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS CURVED OR STRAIGHT. CURVED OR ZIGZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE SKETCH.

AFR 80-17(Cl)

[Top line partially illegible]

What was the angular size? Hold a match at arm's length in front of a known object such as a street lamp or the moon. Note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. Now if you had been able to perform this experiment at the time of the sighting, estimate what fraction of the phenomenon would have been covered by the match head.
