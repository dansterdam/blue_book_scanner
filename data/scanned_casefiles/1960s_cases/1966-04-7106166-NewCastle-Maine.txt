11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers have watched up to 15 objects in the sky at various times. The objects turn, spin, and revolve in a circular direction darting freely at times, then slow down at times for awhile and then race across the sky. The objects appear to be arranged in a pattern, spaced apart evenly, appearing and disappearing at intervals, shooting red flashes across the sky, more appearing after the shooting of the flashes. The objects are seen at all angles during the times they were watched.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, it several times disappeared. It gave off a bluish green discharge and temporarily into the heavens and then reappeared, then away. It would fluctuate in altitude depending upon its position (the lights would change).

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

[Handwritten notes on the sketch: "One seen then at high angles different times a view"]

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

[Handwritten notes: "They turned - spined or revolved in a circular direction in a circular path - then they would dart fairly about - after which they would come down fast and still for a while and then move across the sky - (this is a 3-4 hr observation)"]

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? [Handwritten notes: "There were as many as 15 or"]

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

[Handwritten notes: "I really can't remember specifically, but I do remember they were arranged in a pattern - 'follow the leader' - some would disappear and then reappear. They were quite flickering. They would hover and flash (?) and nothing like they were showing before. More like 'floating' which would seem to be more regular. W.T.S would appear, and then the same sort of pattern repeated itself."]

TELEPHONE NUMBER AGE 25 SEX F

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent.
The only experience I have is star-gazing - and how I've learned I've always been interested in astronomy and I do know the stars. Comets etc. well enough to know that there were not many such things on view at that time. My observations on this were quite casual. I'm not a professional hours of constant observation. I'm not a professional, am administrator, who has been interested therefore I feel that my interest are not actively concerned in any way with UFO's or astronomy. This phenomenon, if occupation is helpful, I can see. Imagination can teach us, which may make my participation not too good.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?

Reported phone call to Miss _______ in Melrose, Massachusetts which is just outside of Boston. This phone call took place on November 30, 1966. Since it is so close to Boston, she is going to get in touch with my daughter and a full and detailed report will be made out. In the meantime, conversation brought our several things.

First of all, that the report was made to the Topsham Air Force Base and they sent out men and the people involved, there were several witnesses, gave detailed reports that the witnesses reported that the Air Force people didn't bother taking many notes despite the fact that the reports of the witnesses were quite detailed. The witnesses stated that the Topsham radar had acquired the objects and this would trace down and because a distant relative of Miss _______ is a Brigadier General in the Air Force, Brigadier General _______, the name had some effect and Topsham reportedly sent down a plane with which the objects apparently played hide-and-seek. These were not just stray lights, but the lights were reported to be attached to a solid object or two solid objects was never seen. The principal object was oval, somewhat like a top, and there was another one in a cigar shape looking somewhat like a child's balloon. I established that the objects moved with respect to the stars and in two or three hours one object went from the northeast to the southwest. She said that many people in the town saw them, but many people were not sufficiently impressed to want to do anything about it. She herself spent quite a bit of money she says, on phone calls to try to arouse interest and get somebody, as she said, to do something about it. She said that the object would hover as the plane got close to it the object would suddenly dart away in a sort of cops and robbers type of chase.

She went to hear a lecture by Raymond Fowler of NICAP and she said she did not mention anything about it in the question period afterward because there were so many people making crazy statements that she did not want to join them, or, I should say, appear to join them.

[Letterhead: Beloit, Wisconsin]
April 11, 1966

Dear Sir,

I am writing to you to pass on our observation of items which could be of interest as well as help in explanation of recently sighted objects in the midwest.

Last Sunday, I arose early and upon gazing out of my living room window, I noticed some flying, lighted objects over a week area about 1/8 mile from our house. The time was exactly 5:47AM.

At first these objects gave a hard-to-explain appearance, but upon rising rapidly at about the height of 730 feet the style went out and were very clearly came by 5 items which could have been said to be flying in formation. These lights were definitely white coming from the breast height of these items, and I believe from reading of objects which

some people have reported, they could have been the same story, this is especially true of it well known or dull. there must further give off which could but be called a photographic glow. I cannot explain the reason for it but it was bright and could have been visible for quite a distance. I believe I observed it for about 7 or 8 seconds. There were other girls in the area which did not quite fit this glow so it is even possible there further have been pointed.

In writing you because these reports will be helpful in explaining some of these sightings. I hope you don't think out of line is a frank letter writer. I was a radio-operator and gunner in our air force in World War II, a busy practicing district in Ripon. This at this time and I clearly above this kind of ours. I'm interested pleased feel free to write me.

Flying Saucer Reported
Over Amagansett Beach

Except for an 'aerial phenomenon easy to describe but hard to understand, it would have been an ordinary Friday night date. The way it was, though, it turned into an unusual evening for two East Hampton teenagers.

The object, they reported, was huge (three or four times the size of an automobile), almost round, had windows on the bottom through which interior light could be seen, and had a red blinking light on top.

It hovered over the bathhouses owned by the Amagansett Beach Association at the foot of Indian Wells Highway, only 25 or 30 feet of the ground, as Gary Hall, 17, and Kathy Finch, 15, drove toward the beach at 9:30 p.m.

It hovered until, as Kathy later explained, "I asked Gary to turn the car lights on R. And then it turned, and went out over the ocean very quickly."

By this time, what they were seeing, the young couple described to bring others to the scene, and they drove to get Gary's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Mark A. Hall of 88 Mill Lane, East Hampton. Mr. Hall is "Prof." Hall of the East Hampton High School faculty.

"By the time we got back, it was gone into the fog over the ocean," Kathy said. The evening had been a foggy one, but Kathy spoke with calm assurance in describing the object they had seen. Asked why they didn't think it was a helicopter, she explained that it was much too large and too round to have been any ordinary flying craft. She also reported seeing three, perhaps unrelated, stationary lights out at sea.

In the meantime, another young East Hampton couple, who had gone down to the beach "for the purpose of looking for unidentified flying objects," reported having been rewarded with an unusual sight. Although they preferred to keep what they had seen "quiet," their sighting was described as "totally unlike" the evening's other UFO.

Mrs. Roy K. Lester of Indian Wells Highway, Amagansett, who is a member of the National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena, said this week that these and quite a few other sightings, "and some of them have been outstanding," had been reported to her, and that Jose Cecin of 1814 Nostrand Avenue, Brooklyn, NICAP subcommittee chairman for New York, had been here a few times to investigate.

'Like Two Saucers Clamped Together'

"It always happens to other people," Curtis Tied, 16, of 50 Accomac Road, East Hampton, observed Monday. "Except this time it happened to me."

What happened was a flying saucer, or rather an unidentified hovering object. The orange and black manifestation was seen by Curtis and Billy Halpern at 1:15 a.m. Saturday over the ocean south of Hither Hills, Montauk.

Friday the 15th was Billy's birthday. Curtis reported. They had gone to Montauk and visited some young ladies living on the Air Force Station, and were hitchhiking home.

"We both saw it but we didn't say anything to each other for a minutes," Curtis said. "Then we both said, 'What in the world is that?'"

"That" was described as "like two orange saucers, clamped together, with a black square in the middle." The night was clear, and the object appeared low over the horizon offshore. Moonrise Saturday was not until 3:22 a.m.

It seemed far away to Curtis, and occupied an area along the horizon which could be covered by an extended index finger. Its orange light was reflected on the ocean below. They watched it for about 15 minutes, Curtis said, and it faded somewhat, one side "shutting off." Then they became somewhat nervous and began running back down Route 27 from a spot near the dump turn-off toward Montauk village, and the object was seen no more.

They hitchhiked back to the Air Station. From there, Airman Robert Schneider drove them to East Hampton.

East Lights

Pvt. Joe Patten, 10:30 p.m. Sunday, Patten reported to William Brockman of the East Hampton Village Police Department went to the Main Beach to investigate a UFO report, called in. The unknown reporter was not there when they arrived, and all they could see was a fishing boat.

This area was visited last week by Gordon Lowe of the Washington, D.C., Office of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, a private organization interested in such matters. With several other NICAF members from this area, he met last Wednesday evening at the home of Mrs. Roy K. Lester, Amagansett, with a group of local "witnesses" of aerial phenomena.

Tape recordings were made. Mr. Lore said some of the sightings were very interesting, and stated that there were two reports of "craft" landing on local roads, taking off at a low angle as soon as approaching car lights hit them.

He said there had been about 12 sightings here in the preceding six weeks. "I'm of the opinion that some of the witnesses are seeing strange unidentified objects that can't be explained by natural phenomena," Mr. Lore stated.

"We're not going to be getting a little boat lights offshore," he added, publicly.

Mr. Lore denied that NICAF had urged secrecy upon any local witnesses, but said it was possible that some local members had suggested that people keep quiet because of possible "adverse publicity."

From Mr. Lore's figure of 12 sightings, it would appear that about half of the UFO incidents here this spring had been reported to the police or otherwise made public. There has been a wide variation in descriptions of what was seen in the published reports, with the unidentified objects differing greatly in size, shape, and color. No occupants or other "beings" have been reported, at least publicly.

THE OBJECT was orange and black.

FOR THE RECORD

Most witnesses did not wish to contact the Air Force because of reports of ridicule and embarrassment from that agency.

Reporters from various nation-wide publications have been in contact with some of the witnesses. Publicity on the East Hampton U.F.O. activities may be forth-coming in the very near future.

The mission of County Radiation Control, is to minimize and control all sources of radiation that may be harmful to the public's health.

Documented evidence from newspapers, books on U.F.O. sightings, and from NICAP, reported radioactivity emanating from U.F.O.'s. Therefore, Radiation Control has been requested by the police authorities to assist them in investigating reported U.F.O. "landings", or "near landings" in Suffolk County.

NICAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SUBCOMMITTEE
13 Friend Court
Waltham, Massachusetts

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTINGS - EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS - APRIL 1966

DATE: 25 June 1966

FROM: Raymond E. Fowler
Chairman, NICAP MASS SUBCOM

TO: NICAP
Washington, D.C.
ATTENTION: Richard Hall
Assistant Director

cc: AFSC-FTD (PROJECT BLUEBOOK)
Congressman William J. Bates

Enclosed is a map of Eastern Massachusetts plotting UFO sightings by location and date for the month of April 1966. Attached to this map is a one-page summary analysis sheet to be used in conjunction with the map. Included are Xerox copies of the month's UFO Reports from which the map and analysis sheets were prepared. The 4-13-66 Sharon Report and 4-22-66 Beverly Report were submitted to you previously.

Basic information on UFO sightings not investigated by NICAP MASS SUBCOM are included in this package to supplement those sightings investigated. In every case a careful check with the Sky-Lite Advertising Company was made to be certain that the illuminated advertising plane was not being reported as the UFO. In most cases it was not airborne. In the New Bedford case, the plane was seen near the sighting area during the sighting time.

The 1966 New England UFO wave began in Southern New Hampshire around power line towers and along the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border. During the latter part of March 1966, the wave picked up in Massachusetts in mid-April. We heard about many sightings that deserved attention but the quantity of reports being received was not too critical on the number. Many reports involved the advertising planes, Jupiter and Venus. Eliminating this type of report was time-consuming. I would estimate that the sightings pictured on the attached map probably constitute only 10% of the actual sightings which took place in this time period.

Most of the UFOs reported were oval-shaped and varying combinations of red, green, white and blue flashing or rotating lights around a generally circular or disc-like configuration. Flight paths are quite apparent, i.e. hovering, then moving with an upward, downward motion and a sideward zig-zag motion. Other motion characteristics were noted.

Highlights were the close-spaced sightings at Beverly and Sharon in two distinct areas. These were confirmed with multiple witnesses who observed the objects themselves. The Beverly sighting was particularly significant because one witness took a head-wave by one of the witnesses who noticed the UFO.

to it as it "hovered low" over the Exeter High School. It immediately closed on the trip and hovered over the witness who did not run at first about 20 feet over her head. UFOs were reported hovering low over schools at Peabody and Attleboro as well as Beverly.

Two interesting facts about the 4-23-66 Dorchester sighting investigated by Walter Wolph (Head Lecturer at Hayden Planetarium) are the simultaneous reading of .625 millirontgens-per-hour by a CDV-700 geiger counter reading of .025 militrontgens-per-hour by a Nucleonic counter. Radiological Monitor for his area. Samples sent out for New England Rays have not been returned and I am still trying to find out what happened concerning this.

In comparing the Eastern Massachusetts April 1966 UFO sightings to those being reported throughout the United States in March and April, I find the same characteristics. It is interesting to note that on 4-19-66 the similar objects to those being sighted in Eastern Massachusetts were being reported simultaneously in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and other nearby states. Over the years the most typical combinations of colors regarding UFOs seen at night are "white", "red", "green", "blue", and "red and white", "blue and green", "white, blue, and green", "white, red, and blue". None of the April sightings occurred in broad daylight but ranged between pre-dusk and pre-dawn.

Other interesting facts were that in the Bellingham and Beverly sightings immediately after the UFOs had disappeared, planes and a helicopter began cross-tracking the area. (Not too long ago the object(s) had been picked up on radar. (Not too long ago a certain person was involved in filling up six-foot bags covered with zip-foil, filled with hydrogen gas and several other samples were collected.) Shortly afterwards a plane and a helicopter arrived and the individuals watched the planes at the high-flying drifting towards balloons. It is unfortunate that people play similar little but so did indicate the rather fast detective and intercept of the supposed UFOs. The presence of the helicopter and aircraft involved in the real UFO sightings are further evidence that something real and unknown was happening in these areas.

The sightings have occurred near NICAP MASS BUSSON since April 23rd. A significant number of objects carrying rotating red, green and white lights. It was spotted flying low over the Watertown Arsenal where an active atomic energy reactor is in use. This sighting was investigated and the report enclosed. A huge object described as looking along Rt. 38 at 3:45 AM to go fishing. A huge object described as looking like two plates with the insides facing on another and a smaller oval object on top. Observed over Rt. 128 and Norwood. No word from Ronald who was driving and hovered again. It was at tree-top level. Ronald stopped his car about 100 feet away and got out to take a closer look. After two minutes he jumped into his car and turned the key. The object with red, blue, and climbed making a right angle turn into the east and out of sight. "It changed colors" to 16 or 18 different colors, blue, white, red, yellow, etc. Then shaken by what had happened. The police described him as rational and intelligent. Unresolved. The Ronald Road incident is in the process of being investigated and a full report will be forthcoming.

Anonymous Calls
Report UFOs

Attleboro — UFO's were reported in Attleboro Tuesday night in the vicinity of the new J. Irvin Studley Elementary School on Rathbun Drive.

Sgt. William E. Heusler, on desk duty at police headquarters, received two anonymous calls in a 10-minute span just after 8:30 p.m. Both callers reported an object bearing red, yellow and purple lights had been hovering over the school for about 20 minutes.

Patrolmen William L. Parslow and Zygmond S. Lycus were detailed to investigate but were unable to see anything in the sky when they arrived.

At 8:45 p.m. Monday a Prospect Street woman reported to police that her son and a neighborhood youngster had just seen a UFO hovering close to the ground in the vicinity of Cliff Street. The youngsters said the object bore two red and two white lights in a circumferential pattern and had a bright light shining downward from the center.

SIGHTING BACKGROUND

During the evening hours of April 17th, the Danvers and Peabody Police stations, Salem Coast Guard Station and the Salem Evening News were flooded with reports from various of a strange object. Upon examining other UFO sightings on this same date, there were as many as 5 different groups of witnesses over a wide area independently reporting the same or similar object as it moved over their particular area.

Detailed accounts are as follows. A map plotting the times and places of the sightings is also included as part of the report.

SIGHTING ACCOUNTS

Group #1 (7:15 PM EST - Danvers)

The Sandolis, along with neighbors, observed the strange objects as it passed over the Rockala section of Danvers. The object was an elongated oval with blinking or rotating bright white lights along its side. Its estimated size was that of a passenger train with bright light shining through its windows. It was flying in a circular pattern from east to west to east. No estimate was made regarding its actual design. It appeared to be 3/4 mile away and moving slowly, about the speed of a paper cub. After circling a half-dozen times in a local area, it disappeared. The witnesses observed the object west of them. Total observing time was about 4 minutes.

Group #2 (7:30 PM EST - Peabody)

About 15 minutes later, Richard and Wayne Emrich and David Pearson who were playing basketball in the Emrich's yard sighted a bright red object flying in a circular pattern with a zig-zag motion. They obtained a telescope and noticed a green light on the object. The bright red light. They fled inside. Harold Emrich (father) to come out and saw it several times. When he finally returned, the object was in the distance but still could be seen clearly. As he watched, it suddenly darted away at a fantastic speed. He told me that no aircraft could move as fast as the object did. The object was viewed for about 10 minutes and was last seen heading NW.

Group #3 (7:45 PM EST - Peabody)

About 15 minutes later and 2-3 miles to the southeast, John Collins was cycling home on Goddard Street when he sighted a round object over the School Dept. Alien's Lane. Upon arriving home he called the attention of his brother Leonard and his friend David to the object. The object carried blinking red and green lights. It would hover over the area of the school and then rapidly spin and look and move. Its apparent size was compared to a half-dollar at arm's length. It appeared to be about a mile away. Its altitude varied as it moved and descended. The red lights, a mile's distance. The circular shape was sharply outlined. The sky was clear. The

Group #3 (continued)

Witnesses were facing West. The object suddenly disappeared from view
when this weird light came out. Turning the object light changed and
down behind houses across the street which blocked the witnesses view.
They could not spot it again.

Group #4 (1620 CST - Wakefield)

About 15 minutes later and 8 miles to the West, Marilyn Fennel and three
friends were watching an object. The object was quite low over Kate Quarrington.
It was oval in shape and two off beams of white then blue then red. It hovered
it moved rapidly up and down several times seemingly coming as low as 50
feet. It was over a warehouse or the lake. It then appeared to be a long
It then leveled off and disappeared behind distant houses heading approximately
southeast towards Bangor. Its apparent size was compared with a dime at
arm's length. The real size was estimated to be at least the size of an
automobile.

Group #5 (1900 PM EST - Abingdon)

A half-hour later and 30 miles to the southeast, Geoson, Dennis and Paul
sighted an unusual object as they were driving along Rice Street in Abingdon.
They stopped the truck and got out to observe the object and were joined by
Dennis. The object was clearly oval in shape. It carried two bright red lights.
When a telescope was obtained and trained on the object, a red light was also seen.
(Note that Group #2 also saw a red light). The object's flight path was unidirectional.
It would hover then move rapidly up and down and look and move in a mile away
and was moving into the east. The speed would vary from slow to very fast. Its
size was compared to slightly less than a jet transport plane. It disappeared
diagonally over the witnesses' horizon toward Hanover (Mass.). The sky was
clear.

EVALUATION:

The Sky-Lite Advertising plane was not flying on this night. The NASA
plane carrying special lighting did not begin its short series of flights
until 11:10 PM and the description did not fit astronomical phenomena. The
similar descriptions of the object, its up and down and zig-zag circular
flight path, its color and all seen to indicate that the five groups all witnessed the same object. It is unfortunate that a more thorough investigation could not have been made - a check with other public agencies, local police, etc. but our investigative group could
not handle the bulk of reports in detail. The object was unconventional
and falls into the category of UFO.

"I saw a light bar because
I was so dark and there wasn't
a star in the sky anyway. I could
tell it was far away, I was over
Wakefield, and it stayed a fixed
position for a half hour. Then
it started to move in a jerky

The UFOs were sighted over the Rocky Hill Veterans Home and Hospital by Mrs. Edward Sparapani of 15 Turnbroke Rd., police said.

The objects were described as oval shaped with red and green lights which hovered over the Home, and then headed toward Hartford.

NOT INVESTIGATED - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO OTHER REPORTS INVESTIGATED BY NICAP MASS SUBCOM. Similar objects sighted earlier at Stoughton, Mass. (8:00 PM); Bellingham, Mass. (10:00 PM) and Quincy, Mass. (11:45 PM) on this same date.

UFO SIGHTING SUMMARY SHEET
UFO REPORT - 4/19/66

WITNESSES: [Redacted names]
Scott Hill Gardens, Bellingham, Mass.
High School Graduate
Graduate, 2 Year Art School

PLACE: Bellingham, Mass.

TIME: 10:00 PM EST

BACKGROUND:
During the UFO sighting wave in Massachusetts during the month of April, NICAP MASS SUBCOM first concentrated on close-up sighting reports. Upon receipt of the Milford News, dated April 21, 1966, which disseminated a close-up UFO sighting at Bellingham, Mass., I dispatched Investigator Reid to interview the witnesses.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT:
Mrs. [Redacted] had just started to walk down [Redacted] to visit Mrs. [Redacted] when she sighted the UFO. She alerted Mrs. [Redacted] and together they observed the low-flying object which looked like an oval craft. Like a cigar, but rather, it would hover on more up-and-down and back-and-forth over a small area. It carried bright red lights, on or near each end, which were as bright as automobile headlights at the same distance. The lights were already at first but began blinking as the object moved out-of-sight later on. The object was silent when first noticed but gave off a high-pitched humming sound when in moved. Estimated altitude was 200 feet. Estimated distance from the observers at the closest point was 300 feet. The object appeared to be large, perhaps at arm's length. Its real size was estimated to be about 40 feet long.

When first noticed, the object was tipped at an angle. The sighting conditions were excellent with a clear sky and strong sunshine. The object was first seen in the Southeast and last seen in the South.

The flight path described by the object during the 2-25 minute total viewing time is as follows: It hovered for about 5 minutes. It then moved from its tilted position to a level position and moved up-and-down and back-and-forth. About half-way down the street the lights went off. It descended behind the woods. As they continued to look for the object, five planes and a helicopter flew over the area. Two planes circled the area and when left, after their "erratic" disappearance, they heard the "missing sound" but could no longer see the object. They went in the house and phoned the police and later the Air Force to whom she gave a detailed description upon request.

EVALUATION:
The Sky-Lite advertising plane did not fly this night. The object described definitely falls into the category of a UFO. It was almost identical to the UFO being reported elsewhere in Massachusetts. On this same night at 8:00 PM an oval object giving off a "piercing humming sound" was seen passing over Stoughton, 20 miles east of Bellingham. It

Was "heading West toward Bellingham" At 8:11 PM two oval-shaped objects with red and green lights were sighted near Rockford, Connecticut. Reporting over the NICAP field area were a report received by the Rocky Hill, Police Dept. on 14 April 66 at 11:15 PM, according to about 30 miles Northeast of Bellingham. There were sightings of similar objects shaped with a "changing disc" or "pendulum". The Bellingham sighting was typical of the many reports received by NICAP MASS SUBGOC.

UFO SIGHTING SUMMARY SHEET
UFO REPORT - 4/19/66

WITNESS: [Redacted]
Peabody, Massachusetts
High School Graduate
Occupation: Shopworker
Vol.

PLACE: N. Shore Shopping Center
Peabody, Mass.
Rt. 114, mile from Center

TIME: 10:45 PM and when after
12:00 AM

BACKGROUND:
A friend of mine works with Francis Fowler at the General Electric. The latter told my friend of the incident and that he had just an office upon his son who was nervous about what he had seen and wanted to talk to him. I immediately contacted Frank and got an interview with him with my brother investigator Richard A. Fowler who carried out the rest of the investigation.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT: (Credit: Richard A. Fowler, Investigator)

The witness went to the rear of "Holiday Lanes" at the Peabody North Shore Shopping Center to empty bottles and was looking pins in the trash when he saw what he thought was a plane about to crash. A closer look revealed that the object was a dark oval vehicle bearing red, green and white lights. It passed overhead while approaching to 15 only 100-150 ft high as he was looking out the east base (40') off the ground. It seemed to be slightly larger than an automobile.

The object passed from heading SSE - NNW clearing trees about 150 yards away from the witness, then turned and stopped over a nearby house. It remained to the only 75-100 ft above the roof top. The object then seemed to have previous flight pattern and hovered back toward the witness and circled 3-4 times above the parking lot. Then the object moved out over the same route and hovered again. It then began moving across the view of the witness (W - E) in no oscillating motion like a sine curve losing altitude and passing behind trees as if it were landing to the left side of Rt. # 114.

The witness returned to the bowling alley and tried to interest the desk clerk in coming to see the object. He finally rounded up 5 more (Jack Clark and companions) to watch. They saw the parking lot looking for any sign of the object. They saw lights in a distant field but nothing else. The witness returned to work until 12:00 AM, then a companion here and returned home.

As the witness and friend (Charles Brock) proceeded North on Rt. 114, a cylindrical beam of light (not traced as a flashlight beam) would boy passed across the road in front of them. They stopped near a house and accused its occupants who were not interested. They then went next door (Residence of [redacted]). Learned what was going on. The young men explained that something was in the field further down the road across Rt. 114 where the cylinder of light seemed to settle down. They asked who the police to come put them along here. The witnesses then


- page 54 -

UFO REPORT (Peabody, Mass. - 4/19/66)

drove their car across 114 to face the open field from which the light was seen. The two young men saw what Frank said was a similar light, configuration to what he had witnessed earlier although this time no object could be made out. The two lights moved in the open while the white and green seemed to interchange as though each were flashing. Then the light configuration suddenly rose up and out of the field moving in one direction like display line and out. No noise was discernible in either sighting even though the first sighting was at fairly close range. The object when in the field seemed to about 100 yards away from the witness.

I did stop and talk with Mrs. [REDACTED] verified the story that the two young men had stopped at their home that night. She said both appeared quite frightened. They looked out but could not see anything although the field was not in line of sight from their garage. No noise. No interference was noticed on their TV as far as they could remember.

The weather was fair and warm. The moon was in the Northeast according to the witness and this checks out. The object like sharply outlined and white light appeared to change from red to green to white. One green and white light appeared to change from one side to the other.

EVALUATION:

The witness [REDACTED] seemed to be a very level-headed young man. His mother told me that he put little stock in UFOs prior to this experience. I would have no reason to doubt his word from the impression of his noted nervousness. No traces were left by the object. The occurrence itself is certainly fantastic and it's hard to believe that no one else witnessed the object and reported it.

*** - CHAIRMAN'S NOTE - 

Similar objects were reported on this same night at Stoughton (8:00 pm); Bellingham (10:00 pm); Sidney (11:45 pm). The description fits those of objects being reported not only in Massachusetts but throughout the United States.

UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT IS
SEEN BY SEVERAL PERSONS
Two Patrolmen
Among Viewers

RANDOLPH - An unidentified flying object, described as large, soundless and emitting a brilliant light, was sighted at about 8:40 Saturday night by two Randolph patrolmen.

Randolph police reported receiving numerous telephone calls during the hour that followed the first sighting. Although exact descriptions varied, police said most callers agreed the object was soundless, about the size of a large flashlight, and had 20 or 40 pusholes toward the top and several, multi-colored flashing lights near its bottom. The calling in a northerly direction was the object was in sight for about a minute. It was.

Patrolmen Frederick Connor and Frank Pace, said they could see the object from their police cruiser. Both men said they were puzzled by the object which was not everything before they described it as seen very.

Mrs. Ruth Johnson of 95 Cottage St. told the Enterprise she was watching television while seated near a picture window. Her attention was attracted outright by a brilliant object in the sky. Mrs. Johnson described it as having an elongated shape, about 4 or 5 inches long, she said. Smaller lights perfect shape. Other, smaller lights flashed continuously off and on, she reported. Mrs. Johnson said the object's speed still was not seen fast. It was to her top and several, multi-colored.

Albin, said he could see the object from his seat across the room from the window. The Johnsons said the object caused no interference with their television, unlike planes which fly over their home. Moving the object from their doorway, the Johnsons said they could hear no sound.

A spokesman at the U.S. Naval Air Station, South Weymouth, expressed skepticism over the report. He said the base had no aircraft out at the time of the sightings, at though he admitted it was not necessarily a Navy airplane which the people saw. The spokesman did not say civilians are not experienced in observing aircraft and UFO.

Randolph police said they also received a report of another object being sighted in that town about 11 P.M. The police reported seeing a round object, humming and spinning across the sky. The caller said the object made such an impression on his wife that she became very nervous.

Almost all callers, Randolph police said, made the same comment: "I thought people who saw these things were crazy but I think I just saw a flying saucer."

Not investigated. May follow up on this one.
