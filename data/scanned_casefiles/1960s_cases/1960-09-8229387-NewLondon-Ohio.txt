Dear Mr. 

Your letter of 17 September 1965, addressed to the U.S. Air Force Academy of Sciences, has been referred to this Office.

There was insufficient information concerning the sighting of a flying object to warrant a detailed investigation. Such information as is available will be considered in relation to our continuing study of unidentified aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,

National Academy of Sciences 
Washington D.C.

Gentlemen:

I would appreciate it if you could send me any information on a certain aerial object that I saw tonight.

The object travelled at a very rapid pace from southwest to northeast at 7:40 P.M. This object gave off a continuous glow or aura which was about 30 and of it's light and because it was single.

Two airplanes did cross on the route between 8:05 on the same night. I an also positive that it was not a meteor. 

This object travelled so fast that I did not have time to get its visibility. I first noticed it at 7:42 P.M. (EST) when it was closest to the zenith and tracked it for THS IS ONLY A ROUGH ESTIMATE.

I am writing to you because you handled the "Sookane Case", and I thought you might be interested in this for me.

Thank you.
