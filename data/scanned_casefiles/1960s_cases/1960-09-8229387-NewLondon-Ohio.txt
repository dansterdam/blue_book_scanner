Dear Mr.

Your letter of 17 September 1960, addressed to the National Academy of Sciences, has been referred to this Office.

There was insufficient information concerning the unidentified flying object you sighted for a valid conclusion. Therefore, we ask that you fill out the attached Air Force Questionnaire and send to the Commander, Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their analysis and evaluation.

New London, Ohio
Dear Mr. [Redacted]:

I regret that we shall not be able to furnish any information regarding an aerial object that you might have seen on the evening of September 17th, since the National Research Council does not conduct observation programs that might bear on your concern.

I am taking the liberty, however, of forwarding your letter to the Department of Defense, in the hope that some office there might be of assistance to you.

Very sincerely,

September 17, 1960

National Academy of Sciences
Washington D.C.

Gentlemen:

I would appreciate it if you could send me any information on a certain aerial object that I saw tonight.

The object travelled at a very rapid pace from approximately Southwest to Northeast at 7:42 P.M. This object gave off or reflected a steady white light which was about as bright as Echo I.

I dismiss the idea that it was an airplane, although there is an air route just north of New London, because of the steadiness of its light and because it was single.

Two airplanes did cross on the route between 8:05 and 8:10 P.M. on the same night.

I am also positive that it was not a meteor.

This object travelled so fast that I did not have time to time its visibility. I first noticed it at 7:42 P.M. (EST/slow time) when it was closest to the zenith and tracked it for about 15 seconds. THIS IS ONLY A ROUGH ESTIMATE.

I am writing to you because you handled the "Rocket and Satellite" division of the 1959 IGY, and I thought you might be able to identify it for me.

Thank you very much,
[Signature redacted]
