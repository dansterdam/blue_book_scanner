   No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
   No

10. CONCLUSION
    1) Other (PROBABLE ROCKET LAUNCH)
    2) Astro (POSSIBLE STARS/PLANETS)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
    The observer was driving his tractor when the headlights and radio went out. He noticed a large light rising over the horizon. From within this light as much brighter and smaller light rose. The second light appeared much like a 4th of July rocket except it did not explode. The larger light gradually grew fainter until it disappeared.

    COMMENTS: A Minuteman rocket was launched from Vandenburg AFB, California at 1939 PST of 21 Oct 69 (2139 MDT), and appears to be the stimulus of the visual sighting. There is no evidence that the visual sighting and the electrical failures are related. The sightings of 11 and 13 Nov are possibly stars and/or planets.

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO)                   21 November 1969

The following report contains information accumulated during the investigation
of the reported sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) near Twin Falls,
Idaho. The sighting occurred during the early evening of 21 October 1969 and
was reported to Wing Command Post 23 October 1969 by Mr. Richard Farrett, Route
# 1, Twin Falls, Idaho on 23 October 1969.

The investigation was conducted by Tgt Theodore C. Ackley, FR 004-36-3586, 67th
Security Police Squadron, Mountain Home AFB, Idaho on 19 and 20 November 1969.

[Redacted] was not the individual who observed the phenomenon. He had
been told of the sighting by the person who actually observed the phenomenon, Mr.
[Redacted], Idaho.

A character check of the reporters of the incident [Redacted] was deemed appropriate. The below listed personnel of local law
enforcement agencies were contacted for this information:

Mr. Eddie Lammers - Deputy Sheriff, Twin Falls County, Idaho: Negative report.
Mr. Harold Jensen - Sgt, Twin Falls City Police: Negative Report.

These personnel were asked to furnish information as to the reported sightings of
additional UFO's. Mr. Eddie [Redacted] stated that his department had received a report
of a UFO 0525 hours, 4 November 1969 and that he had conducted an investigation
into this reporting. He stated [Redacted] Idaho reported seeing strange lights in the foothills south of Twin Falls. Mr.
[Redacted] confirmed these lights to have been made by night hunters, poaching deer
in the foothills.

Throughout this investigation the persons interviewed were queried regarding
sightings of additional UFO's. The investigator received numerous vague accounts
of unexplainable lights seen in the Twin Falls, Idaho area. Times, dates and
names of sighters could not be furnished therefore no further investigation could
be conducted into these sightings.

While talking to Mr. [Redacted] he stated his mother [Redacted]

Here is the OCR text from the document:

had observed strange lights in the sky the week prior to this investigation. As these sightings appeared to have been in the same general direction as that sighting by Mr. [redacted], as they were the most recent reported, a complete investigation was conducted. [redacted] completed two (2) AF Form 117s covering the phenomenon which she observed.

COMMENTS BY THE INVESTIGATOR CONCERNING THE WITNESS IN THE TWIN FALLS, IDAHO SIGHTING:

Mrs. [redacted] is a housewife, living on a small farm in a rural farming community located approximately twelve (12) to fifteen (15) miles southwest of Twin Falls, Idaho. She lives with her husband and one (1) daughter. [redacted] appears to be a normal, well-adjusted reliable person. She was intelligent and rational in her conversation with the investigator. At no time was it indicated that the family indulged in intoxicants of any kind. She did not appear to be dramatic about what she had seen nor did she appear to be completely disinterested. She stated she thought it "was something the Air Force was doing which she had no need to know about". She further explained that she realized the Air Force conducted a lot of tests that were not made public and that she accepted this as being necessary. [redacted] and the daughter living with them were not interviewed.

Mr. [redacted] lives in the same rural farming community approximately four (4) miles from [redacted]. He lives with his wife and two (2) small children. They appear to be normal, well adjusted, hard working people. There was no indication that the family indulged in intoxicants of any kind.

REMARKS BY THE INVESTIGATOR:

The area where [redacted] live is generally flat land, broken by low ridges and void of heavy vegetation. This land is used as grazing land for ranch stock and as farm land for corn, hay, sugar beets, etc. This country is [redacted]. Recently farmers in this area have been plagued with losses of hay crops and out-buildings due to mysterious fires. The general feeling in the area is that a pyromaniac has been the cause of these fires. Many farmers and families have been maintaining night vigilance over their property. This explains why [redacted] was looking out the windows of her house at odd

of the night time and observed these strange lights.

REPORT FROM TWIN FALLS MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, TWIN FALLS, IDAHO:
Mr. HARRY MERRICK, Airport Manager was interviewed. He stated there has been no
reports of UFOs made to his office. He stated they maintain no log of aircraft
flights at his office. These records are maintained at the FAA Office, Burley
Municipal Airport, Burley, Idaho. The U.S. Weather Bureau for this area is
located at the Snake River Conservation Research Center, Kimberly, Idaho.

REPORT FROM FAA OFFICE, BURLEY MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, BURLEY, IDAHO:
Mr. LEO PEIRCE interviewed.
Mr. Peirce stated there had been no unusual air traffic on the dates in question
that would account for the unusual sightings.

REPORT FROM U.S. WEATHER BUREAU, KIMBERLY, IDAHO:
Mr. LLOYD J. GRAYBILL interviewed.
Mr. Graybill was unable to furnish any information regarding the winds-aloft. The
following information was available regarding surface weather conditions on the
dates indicated:

21 October 1969
Surface winds - Southerly, Average 3.8 miles all day.
No clouds reported. Clear all day. Negative precipitation or thunderstorms in
the area. Temperature - Average high, 64 degrees. Low 30 degrees.

11 November 1969

REPORT FROM REEDER FLYING SERVICE, TWIN FALLS MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, TWIN FALLS, IDAHO:

Mr. Reeder interviewed.

The reeder flying service has not been doing any night flying. This service operates the only helicopters in the area however they have done no flying during the times of the sightings.

It was thought these sightings could have possibly been parachute type flares, used by farmers in the area as protection against frost. None of the persons interviewed are aware of any such type flare drops.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

[Redacted name] stated she had observed the strange lights through binoculars. These binoculars were: Busco, 7 x 50. Coated lenses. Field 7.1° 373 Ft at 1000 y.s. No. U 771753.

[Redacted name] stated that what he had seen had also been observed by Mr. [Redacted], Idaho. [Redacted name] interviewed. He was reluctant to talk about the incident to the investigator and declined accomplishing a questionnaire. He stated he felt he could not offer any information other than what had been already submitted.

COMMENTS BY THE INVESTIGATOR:

It is felt by the investigator that [Redacted names] both were sincere in relating what they had seen. They both expressed the desire that their names not be released to the news media in relation to the incident.
