Here is the text from the document:

Oklahoma City, Okla
Sept 17th, 1962

To Whom it may Concern,

Last Friday, Sept 14th, I was visiting with my daughter on 2014 S4th St at this city. My grand children were playing outside, called my attention to the sky. With difficulty I observed the object which seemed to be a plane, maneuver about fifty or sixty thousand feet up. There were no signs of trail. I tried to reach Tinker Field and the radio station here. It was about four P.M. and no one answered. Finally I got the newspaper on the phone and some one said they would investigate. But the late afternoon sun brought out the features to resemble a plane. I could not see its motor.

Verytruely Yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]
