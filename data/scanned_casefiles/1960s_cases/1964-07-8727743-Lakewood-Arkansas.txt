Object. But prior to calling me he had called a friend the weather for the U.S. Weather Bureau in Little Rock to get about their weather balloon. He was advised they release one at 2300 mill each day and he now thought that may have been what he had seen previously. I called the Weather Bureau to confirm. The fact. Upon reviewing available data, using the "Villa plot" report data in my message, it is believed that the object was, in fact, a meteorological balloon which has been released from Adams field, located at 6.2 SE of the observer's position. The wind would have kept the balloon to the NE until reaching an extremely high altitude at which time it would have been blown toward the SE.

THIS TIME, (K) CHIEF INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 384TH BWG. INITIAL

ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE SUNLIGHT REFLECTING OFF THE AIRCRAFT CAUSED A

PHENOMENA THAT APPEARED TO THE OBSERVER A SOLID OBJECT AT FIRST, AND

THE OBJECT APPEARING TO BREAK-UP WAS CAUSED BY SUN STRIKING AIRCRAFT

AT DIFFERENT ANGLES THUS CAUSING TWO REFLECTIONS RATHER THAT THE ONE.

OBSERVER SAYS HE LOST ON PART BUT FOLLOWED THE OTHER UNTIL IT

DISAPPEARED. THIS IS BELIEVED WAS THE REFLECTION FOLLOWING

AIRCRAFT. THE ONE THAT DISAPPEARED WAS DUE TO LOSS OF LIGHT REFLECT-

ION AS AIRCRAFT MOVED. 1. NEGATIVE.
