The same Capt Holley was asked if he knew anything about the sighting. He said at the
time he tried to determine time - long, he had been
able, with negative results, to develop some details
that or some UFO sighting time. He could get at
the time and calling to individually, it got the next three

Brilliant yellow-orange, round, size of half dollar. Object appeared like a rotating beacon at about 50 yards a min causing a very brilliant beam. Seen 2-3° above horizon. Disappeared instantaneously.

11. COMMENTS
A team of investigators went to the scene of the sighting and were able to view the object reported. 3 days after the sighting on 12-15 they were able to view a rotating beacon mounted on a 50 ft pole, which had the same characteristics as the object. Weather at time of sighting was 100-200 ft ceiling with 1/2 mile visibility. It is possible that this was the first time witness saw these conditions. Therefore, it is probable that object was rotating beacon.

At 16:55, 22 Dec 60, Called Captain
Hedley, Persistent Operations Officer at Base
208 Layer, for additional information on the
alleged UFO sighted on 12 Dec 60 southwest
of Seminole, Texas. He was joined about halfway
stated that a T-33 was dispatched to the area
16 Dec 60 and the pilot sighted a strange blip on
his radar scope at first sight. The UFO had all
the characteristics of an unspotted UFO. At the
same time Capt Hedley was aware of the known
long jet flight that had been there. He would not be
able to rule out a determination how long it had been
there, with negative result being added. He could get
a good view of the sightings. At could get at the
end talking to individuals. At got there and then
it disappeared, etc. for some time.

1. Lt 10:55 #2 Lue 60. The following additional information, concerning the UFO sighted southwest of Seminole Heights, was received from Capt. Hadley, Assistant Precitation Spilled, Dept AFB Flyers.

2. Lines. The civilian observer was in moving trucks and was checking the equipment of an oil company. The oil company has samples, trucks and other equipment located in the area where the UFO was seen. This was 6 or 7 trucks in the area, all radio equipped, and only one experienced corp. radio trouble. The fact that the others didn't have radio trouble indicated this to be a coincidence. The civilians were the only ones.
