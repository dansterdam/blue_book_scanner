Here is the text produced by the OCR system:

In the early evening of 8 December 1960 a large oval shaped object was observed about 2 miles SW of Seminole, Texas. The object was in sight for about 20 minutes. At times it appeared to be hovering and at other times it seemed to be moving slowly. The object made no sound and was estimated to be 30-40 feet in diameter. At times a reddish-orange glow was seen around the edge of the object.

Several people in the area observed the object and it was reported to the Sheriff's office. Some of the witnesses were quite frightened as they had never seen anything like this before. Their descriptions of the object were consistent with one another.

The object was observed to leave the area at a high rate of speed, going straight up and disappearing from sight. No aircraft or other conventional objects were seen in the area at the time.

Text from the document:

Her seen double or rather appears to be identical: witnesses accounts do not contain any indication of a translocation or transformation: appear in 12 to 15 seconds - color grey: approximate altitude 12 to 15 feet: extreme rapidity of motion approximately 12 to 15 mph: duration of visibility was [approximately] 8 to 10 seconds: no noises or lights of any kind were observed. Eyewitness states that the object was oval or rounded in shape and appeared to be hovering rather than moving with great speed. Apparently this phenomenon was also seen and reported by other reliable witnesses. Careful investigation should be made to determine if any radar or other electronic tracking data is available. Detailed analysis of all witness accounts should be made, as this sighting appears to be of much evidential importance.

Transcription of the text in the document:

1. The object observed was visible from approximately 6:00, while my
father waVenroute home from work, continuing on about 6:10. It was brow
ish in color, seemed round in shape, and was hovering in the area. It
made no noise, and had no visible means of propulsion. It was slowly
moving in a northeasterly direction. This was a clear night, and the ob
ject was clearly visible. All sightings were made from a 1952 Chevrolet
automobile, and reported to the Air Force the following day.

2. The nearest town was Seminole, Texas, which is approximately 8 miles
south of the location where the object was sighted. Seminole is the co
unty seat of Gaines County, which is sparsely populated. There are no
large industries or military installations in the immediate area. The
sighting took place on a clear, calm night, with good visibility for a
radius of several miles. There was no unusual activity or noise in the
area at the time. The object was seen by two adults, and they are in
agreement as to what they observed.
