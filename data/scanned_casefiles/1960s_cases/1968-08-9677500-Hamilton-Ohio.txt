INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

Friday, August 23rd a sighting was made by local Hamilton people of the same type and object as our local paper on Saturday with a drawing and description.

On Friday, August 30th we observed this phenomenon as to date described.

On Friday, September 6th, 1968 we observed another phenomenon but it was different. This was observed by my husband, our 11 year old daughter and myself. If you wish information concerning this sighting please advise.

Close this questionnaire which I have just mailed who the same as the question answered once I have the reply. Sincerely, Billie Dejong, Route 7, Box 146, Hamilton, Ohio.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                26 August 1969

Subj:  UFO Observation, 21 Aug 68

On 25 Aug 68 Lt Marano called the Pacific Test Range. Lt Col Sample
said that they had not had a shot, however, he thought that Vandenburg
had one the 21st at approximately 0630 local (1330Z). Suggested I
call Vandenburg and ask for extension 52082. Pacific Test Range is
Pt Magu.

Lt Marano called Vandenburg AFB on 26 Aug 68 and talked to Capt
Jepsen. Vandenburg had a ballistic launch at 1300Z. I gave Capt Jensen
a description of the sighting and he said that the launche was
undoubtedly the stimulus.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

TALKED TO MR [REDACTED]

TWO PILOTS FLYING WEST OBSERVED THE METEOR AT ABOUT THEIR ONE O'CLOCK POSITION, APPROXIMATE POSITION - ALBANY, NEW YORK.

REPORTS INDICATE THAT METEOR WAS GOING TOWARD GREAT LAKES AREA. POSSIBLY NORTH OF ROME BUT SOUTH OF WATERTOWN.

MR [REDACTED] ADDED THAT IT PROBABLY BURNED UP BECAUSE IT LEFT A VERY WIDE TRAIL, AND TRAVELED SLOWLY (DESPITE A DURATION OF ONLY A FEW MINUTES) WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT IT WAS PROBABLY A LIGHT OBJECT AND THAT IT RELEASED A LOT OF ITS MASS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH OPTICAL ENERGY RADIATED.

REPORT OF BARNSTABLE MASS. SIGHTING OF JULY 29, 1968

On July 29, 1968, at approximately 1:30 All Henry Jellows was driving north on Rt. 6 in Barnstable, Mass. Linda Soares was a passenger in the car. They both saw a bright white object flash by overhead at a speed consistent with a meteor or distant debris line in front of them. They had the impression that it came down a few miles in front of them. Although of course there is no way to get an indication of the distance, they believed it was too bright to be a meteor. Since there are meters considerably brighter than most people are familiar with, this report could be attributed to a meteor except for what followed shortly afterward.

They had both decided they had seen a meteor, and continued along Rt. 119. A few miles further along they were driving next to an empty field when they both suddenly heard an extremely loud noise. They both had difficulty describing it, and said it sounded like nothing they had ever heard before. (They said they were familiar with the sounds of aircraft and helicopters.) Henry Jellows described it as a loud echoing whirring sound that seemed to also warble. Linda Soares said it sounded like a large swarm of locusts, but very loud. They agreed that the sound started abruptly, continued for twenty seconds, and then stopped abruptly. They said it sounded a little like the sound effects used with TV science fiction programs. They sound seemed to be coming from the field to the left of the car. They stopped the car and looked into the field, but didn't see anything in the darkness. (He didn't think of pointing his headlights into the field.) Miss Soares was afraid so they drove on. Henry Jellows returned to the field alone about a half hour later, but didn't see or hear anything unusual.

I interviewed them on August 2, 1968, and went to the field with Henry Jellows. It is a large open grassy field with scattered small bushes. A grass covered runway runs parallel to the road approximately 100 yards from the road. Approximately 200 yards from the road is the hanger of the Cape Cod Flying Service. We walked around the area but didn't find anything unusual. A geiger counter showed only normal background count. I checked with the owner of the airport (a small private field) and found that the airport has no lights and closes at sundown. There was no noise heard.

The airport owner also said that the field is not used by helicopters. Since no light was seen when they heard the sound, the airport was excluded. Although no aircraft was noted, I don't believe it was an aircraft they heard. The field seems to be an unknown.

Checking with the Barnstable Police disclosed nothing unusual on the blotter that night.

The enclosed clipping seems to be a mistaken identification of a high flying aircraft and doesn't appear to have any connection with this sighting.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES AUG. 26-SEPT. 1, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are coded from one National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Public

The Surface Weather Map presents shown as dashed lines, and are labeled station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the points plotted result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The height contours are shown as contour lines and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are

shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24 hour period ending at 1:00 a.m./e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperatures are plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperatures is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete data are shown. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

MONDAY, AUGUST 26, 1968

The rest of the text is part of the weather map and appears to be various numerical and meteorological notations such as "LOW" and "HIGH" along with contour lines and other meteorological symbols. The specific numerical values and detailed annotations are difficult to read clearly due to the image quality.


- page 37 -

The image appears to be a technical document with multiple panels containing what seem to be meteorological or topographical maps with contour lines, grid patterns, and various markings. However, as an OCR system, I cannot definitively read any specific text on the document due to the low contrast and image quality. The text appears to be too small or blurry to accurately transcribe.
