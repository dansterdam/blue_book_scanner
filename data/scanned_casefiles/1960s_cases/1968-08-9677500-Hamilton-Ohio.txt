I. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

The text on the page appears to be a handwritten description of a UFO sighting. It describes the sighting of a "glowing red ball" on August 23rd at approximately 8:30 PM. The report mentions that the object was observed for about 5 minutes and then disappeared. It also discusses the observer's attempt to get a closer look at the object, but being unable to do so due to the object's rapid movement and disappearance.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
TALKED TO MRS. HAMILTON

TWO PILOTS FLYING WEST OBSERVED THE METEOR AT ABOUT THEIR ONE O'CLOCK POSITION, APPROXIMATE POSITION - ALBANY, NEW YORK. ASPECTS INDICATE THAT METEOR WAS GOING TOWARD GREAT LAKES AREA, POSSIBLY NORTH OF ROME BUT SOUTH OF WATERTOWN.

MRS. HAMILTON SAID THAT IT PROBABLY BURNED UP BECAUSE IT LEFT A VERY WIDE TRAIL, AND TRAVELED SLOWLY (DESPITE A DURATION OF ONLY A FEW MINUTES) WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT IT WAS PROBABLY OF A LIGHT OBJECT AND THAT IT REMAINED A LOT OF ITS MASS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH OPTICAL ENERGY RADIATED.

REPORT OF BARNSTABLE MASS - SIGHTING OF JULY 29, 1968

On July 29, 1968, at approximately 12:30 AM, a house in Harthmouth at approximately 12:30 AM, a witness was driving north on IRS 25, at a point a few miles north of Harthmouth, Mass., when he
observed an unusual light in the sky to the east approximately 2 miles from his position. He slowed down his vehicle to observe the light. The light appeared to be large and disc-shaped. There were several smaller lights in front of them. They had the impression that it came down a few miles and then disappeared from sight. The witness was unable to give any estimate of the size or distance of the object, since there are no familiar objects or meters with which to compare. Since there are meters of considerable brightness that they said would be attributable to a meteor, except that they did not behave as shooting stars this should be considered an unknown. They had both decided they had seen a meteor, and continued along their way.

Checking with the Barnstable Police disclosed nothing unusual on the police blotter.

The enclosed clipping seems to be a mistaken identification, as the report in no way corresponds to have any connection with this sighting.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES AUG. 26-SEPT. 1, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the regular National Weather Bureau publication, the Daily Weather Map. They include, in addition to the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Historical Weather Forecast Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are derived from data secured from the National Weather Center Weather Station, the synoptic data of the Surface Weather Map, and the 500-Millibar Chart as well as from other sources.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the isobars or lines of equal pressure at the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined high and low pressure areas are indicated by symbols as shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The temperature pattern is indicated by isotherms, which are lines connecting points of equal temperature, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values of temperature for the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The winds of the preceding map are indicated by wind barbs, half and full barbs, showing speed in knots. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather records that control the areas of precipitation as shown are quite selective, and are limited in purpose to the operational use of the maps; and on large scale maps, local details cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

Copies of Daily Weather Maps for 48 contiguous States may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. Back copies may also be obtained at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

SUMMARY
Time : 0230 EDT 
Duration : 7-10 minutes
Sky Conditions: Partly Cloudy
Visibility: Unrestricted
Temp: Not Given
Wind: NW at 10-15 mph

NARRATIVE 
At 0230 EDT, the observer was awakened by a bright light in the sky. He looked out the window and observed a large brilliant object in the sky, much brighter and larger than any star. The object was white in color and appeared to be spinning or revolving. It then moved slowly to the west and disappeared behind some trees. The observer estimated the object was about twice the size of the Full Moon and the light was so bright it illuminated the ground.
Immediately after this, the observer noticed several small red lights in the sky, moving erratically and rapidly. These lights appeared to be about the size of a star, but much brighter. The observer watched these lights for 7-10 minutes before they faded from view. No sound was heard during the observation.

The report states:

"The strange object that was seen that night was observed by two people who were husband and wife, living on a farm outside of Hamilton, Ohio. They reported seeing a bright light in the sky that approached their farm and appeared to land in a field near their house. They went outside to investigate and saw that the light was coming from a large, oval-shaped object that was hovering above the ground. The object was silent and had no visible means of propulsion. It illuminated the surrounding area with a bright, white light. After a few minutes, the object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. The witnesses stated that the object seemed to defy the laws of physics and that they were very shaken by the experience. They reported the incident to the local authorities, who in turn forwarded the information to Project Blue Book for investigation."
