CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE, 12 OCTOBER 1960

A Mysterious Object in Sky Thrills a Jet Aerospace Research Called Key to Future

By ROBERT WIEDRICH
Capt. J. R. Petrie of Trans-ways Airline in an eye-to-eye vantage point in the sky, cased airman, not given to believing in flying saucers or even witches with Halloween what-with Capt. Petrie being, last week saw something

By HAROLD W. WALL, Times Financial Editor
There has never been a period in world history when a nation has brought into so many new and different positions its technological know-how as America is doing today. This is the view of Robert T. Gross, Aircraft Corp. board chairman, who yesterday reviewed the progress

But yesterday, when Petrie so spotted a gleaming object could glimpse the gleaming, pace is now.

O, he blinked, then asked for a camera.

Petrie had been enjoying the clear air and bright sunshine at 35,000 feet as he cruised his giant Electra jet from New York City to Chicago. The view was excellent high above the Ohio farmland. Back in the cabin, 50 passengers were enjoying their flight.

Photographs Object
The object, about 100 feet in diameter and almost translucent, appeared to be at an altitude of 115,000 to 110,000 feet, far above his jet.

A radar control center in the Toledo area radioed Capt. Petrie and requested that he pursue this object.

Petrie racked back that he couldn't do that because it would mean altering from his flight plan but offered to do the next best thing. He borrowed the camera of his co-pilot and clicked off several shots.

Well, sir, it was pretty exciting, up there. For a while what is it? Was it a flying saucer? Well, he asked the stewardess. "Could it be something from outer space?" Was it a space craft to prove daily living has a determined Capt. Petrie kept banging away with his borrowed camera, then concluded on toward Chicago.

Radar tracked an unidentified object to his lines close at O'Hare later.

Air Force Sets Film
The passengers went on their way and Capt. Petrie turned his film over to Maj. McDaniel, who passed the film along to his superiors and experts and they thought the object might have been a weather balloon.

Maj. Michael packed the film in his plane and sent it on its way to world headquarters in Triars, Md., where presumably with a file it will rest.

AVIATION DAILY, 17 OCTOBER 1960 (15)

AF PREPARES GF-104 PROGRAM TESTS
Air Force crews are winding up preparations to begin flight testing of the Lockheed F-104 on a pilotless aircraft. The program is slated to get underway in November at Eglin AFB, Fla. Two series of flight tests of prototype GF-104 are being conducted at Lockheed's Palmdale, Calif., flight test center.
