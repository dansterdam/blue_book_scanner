Dear Mr [redacted]

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you reported unusual objects on your television set which resembled "Flying Saucers."

There is no way of judging exactly what the strange objects were, but our technicians assume that it was some unusual type of interference which caused peculiar objects to flash on the set. As you know, outside interference from electrical motors in your neighborhood could cause your television set to have peculiar patterns on the screen, and there is no way to anticipate what form these patterns might take.

Enclosed is an Air Force Fact Sheet on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects which we think will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF

Mr. [redacted]
Baltimore, Maryland
