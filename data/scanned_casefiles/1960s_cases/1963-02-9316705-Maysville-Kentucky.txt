REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

On February 9, 1963, at approximately 6:30 p.m., a law enforcement officer from Maysville, Kentucky, reported sighting an object which he believed to be an unidentified flying object.

The officer stated that while on routine patrol, he observed a bright light in the sky moving in an erratic manner. The object was described as round, with a reddish-orange color and giving off a pulsating glow. It was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and moving at a high rate of speed, approximately 800-1,000 miles per hour.

The officer watched the object for several minutes as it maneuvered in the sky, making sharp turns and abrupt changes in direction. He reported that the object appeared to hover briefly before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

No other witnesses were identified, and no physical evidence or corroborating reports were obtained. The case was classified as an unidentified flying object by the investigating agency.

UFO REPORT
MAYSVILLE, KENTUCKY
8 February 1963

On 8 February a man was returning from a shopping expedition in Maysville. He was driving along the road when he noticed another car parked on the opposite side of the road. As he approached the parked car, he noticed two light colored objects, one above the other, hovering over the car. As he drew closer, the objects began to move, went straight up, came together and moved off to the southwest. The man reported the sighting to the Air Force for investigation.

Subsequent investigation revealed that the objects reported in this incident could not be definitely identified. The description, size, color, and other factors precluded identifying them as any known aircraft. The incident was considered unsolved.

A check with the local police and sheriff's office in Maysville failed to reveal any other reports of unidentified flying objects in the area on the date of this incident. The Air Force was notified of the results of the investigation.

POULTRY BREEDERS
MAYSVILLE, KY.
February 18, 1963

Dear Sirs:

On the night of February 11, 1963, my wife and I witnessed a very unusual aerial phenomenon over Maysville, Kentucky. It was approximately 8:25 P.M. EST when we first observed the object in the southern sky. It appeared to be very high in altitude and was traveling at a high rate of speed in a northeast direction. The object was glowing with a bright orange-red color and appeared to be cigar-shaped or elliptical in form. The glow seemed to be entirely self-luminous, without any visible exhaust or contrail.

After observing the object for approximately one minute, it suddenly accelerated to an extremely high speed and disappeared from view in a matter of seconds. Its speed was far in excess of any known aircraft. We were quite amazed and puzzled by this unusual sighting.

I would appreciate any information or explanation you might be able to provide concerning this aerial phenomenon. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
