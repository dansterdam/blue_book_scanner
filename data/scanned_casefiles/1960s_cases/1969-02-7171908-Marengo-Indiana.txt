The image contains two sketches or illustrations, but no photographic image.

The text output from the OCR is as follows:

6A. HOW TO INDICATE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN: PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "+" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "+". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON. INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT WAS SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER IT BROKE UP OR EXPLODED, DESCRIBE THE SHAPE OR INDICATE IF IT APPEARED FUZZY OR SHARP. INDICATE COMPARISONS WITH FAMILIAR OBJECTS, LIKE STAR, A LIGHT, OR AIRCRAFT:

A light in the sky, glowing in a dark blue or black color, was observed. It was observed for a period of time, and the light grew brighter and dimmer during the observation, as if pulsing. The light appeared similar to an evening star or planet, but its brightness varied more than is typical for a celestial object.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a form with various questions about a UFO sighting.

Text found in the document:

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL & STATIONARY?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
FLASH OR EXPLODE?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IS. WHAT DID YOU ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
It was about 8:45 P.M. last evening, and I was looking out of the south window standing on the top of the steps. I noticed something coming across the sky (it was moving very fast). It was very bright and had no tail, and was shaped like a star. Watch, I thought it was a shooting star. When it got closer, I saw that it was no star. It was a sort of orange-red color, and it changed brightness several times as it came across the sky. Then, it suddenly disappeared.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It just seemed to vanish, like the distant disappearance of an aircraft or spaceship.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
[Checkbox] YES [Checkbox] NO. IF "YES" DESCRIBE.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram of an object described as "BLACK". The text in the image asks the observer to "DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT INDICATE WHAT THE OBJECT IS SUPPOSED TO BE, SUCH AS WINDOWS, FINS, AND INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION OR VAPOR TRAIL, INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON MOTION." The text at the bottom of the image states "PAGE 6 OF 9 PAGES".

WHAT WAS IT? IS IT A REGULAR SIZE, HOLD A MATCH AT AN ARMS ENERGY FROM A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW DO YOU JUDGE IT'S SIZE? HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE AT THE SCENE OF THE SIGHTING? ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE FULL OBJECT WAS OBSERVED.

The image does not contain any photographs. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

17. DID YOU OBSERVE THE PHENOMENON THROUGH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING? INCLUDE INFORMATION ON MODEL, MAKE, DIAMETER, ETC.
EYEGLASSES
BINOCULARS
WINDSHIELD
SIDE WINDOW OF VEHICLE
WINDOW PANES
IF OBSERVED THROUGH GLASSES, TELESCOPE, THEODOLITE, OR OTHER OPTICAL SYSTEM, GIVE THE FIELD OF VIEW IN DEGREES. [ ] YES [ ] NO
A. DO YOU NORMALLY WEAR GLASSES? [ ] YES [ ] NO
B. DESCRIBE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW, INCLUDING SPEED AND DURATION OF THE PHENOMENON. GIVE ESTIMATE OF SPEED: 25 mph.
The object was visible for about 2 or 3 seconds. It appeared to be rather low and large, difficult to judge the actual distance, but it was dark and looked as if it were about 50 to 100 feet in diameter. It had a distinct circular shape with no protruding parts that could be discerned. It appeared to be a dark gray or black in color, and it seemed to travel silently, with no exhaust or vapor trail. The object had a peculiar motion, not exactly straight-line, but a kind of wavy or oscillating motion, but could not be called erratic. It seemed to be under some kind of intelligent control and had a purposeful movement. At no time did it appear to reflect any light, and it did not seem to have any lights of its own. I could not estimate the actual speed, but it appeared to be moving at a rather rapid rate, perhaps 25 or 30 mph, as I mentioned. The object passed behind some trees and was lost from view. I saw no other aircraft in the vicinity at that time.
21. DID YOU NOTICE ANY ODOR, NOISE, OR HEAT EMANATING FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF?
The object was completely silent, and I noticed no accompanying heat, light, or noise.
A. DID THE PHENOMENON DISTURB THE GROUND OR LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE? [ ] YES [ ] NO
IF YES, DESCRIBE:
