Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Your letter of March 5th addressed to the Civil Aeronautics Administration has been referred to this office.

The Air Force is assigned the responsibility for the air defense of the United States with the further responsibility of investigating all reports of unusual aerial objects over the U.S., including those any become identified as flying objects.

The study and analysis of reported sightings of UFOs is conducted by a selected scientific group under the supervision of the Air Force. The selected scientists involved in these analyses are completely objective and apply scientific methods of examination to all cases in reaching their conclusions.

The information supplied in your letter is not sufficient for a conclusive UFO sighting. Enclosed you will find ATIC form #164. We request that you complete this form and forward it directly to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, marked for the attention of: ATCIC-1422, 16 page, of other witnesses to this sighting. We request this information be included in your report.

Sirs:

I was sitting in a swing in my backyard in Lanett, Alabama, on Sunday, March 5, 1961, facing the north, at approximately 12:21 P.M., B.S.T., I looked up at an angle of about 45 degrees, in time to see a very fast moving "thing" traveling at high altitude on a course of SW to NE. There was no noise and no vapor trail. The "thing" appeared to be colored largely orange with some silver near the edges, and was round or disk shaped. I called to my wife and my year old son. The boy came in time to catch a glimpse of the "thing." My wife was a little to late to have its pointed out to her before it went out of sight in the north-eastern sky. It also appeared to be about the same size to my eyes.

The plane nearest Lanett appeared to be, as far as I could estimate, about 4 times as large as this "thing" traveling about 4 times the speed of Bono I. I could not judge the altitude, but the lack of noise and vapor trail indicated very high. Atlanta, the general direction in which it traveled, is about 80 air miles from Lanett. I estimate the thing could have reached the Atlanta area in less than four minutes from the time I saw it, or at about 12:25 P.M., E.S.T., Sunday, March 5, 1961. My little boy said he had heard the thunder sound of a jet a little before I called to him, but it seems unlikely the only I saw was a jet-plane. If it was a jet, it was absolutely the fastest moving I have seen.

I identify myself as private pilot, airman certificate, former member of LaGrange, Georgia, Civil Air Patrol, residing at, Lanett, Alabama.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]
