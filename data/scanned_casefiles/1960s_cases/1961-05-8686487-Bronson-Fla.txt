SMSgt Harold R. Senick
U.S.A.F. Radar Site
Cross City, Florida

Dear Sergeant Senick:

I am searching for some information regarding several UFO's sited
by personnel of Tyndall AFB during the period 20 through 22 May 61.

I understand that you were privileged to take a photograph of at least
one of these UFO objects on or about 18 May 61 and that you have
shared this information with the Air Force.

If you have a photo or the negative of an Unidentified Flying Object,
request you forward a copy of the photo along with a copy of the report
to this headquarters at your earliest convenience. We need this information to confirm, among other things, what this base and to forward proper
channels for its record.

MSgt Lacour, this station, had a siting on 20 May 1961 and to of the
opinion that your photo was of the same object of which he also has a
picture.

If you have forwarded copies of the photo and report we respectfully
request your earliest information in to time. Date and place of where you
sent the report. Our reports of sightings are on 20 May and 22 May
1961 with other unconfirmed visual reports.

Thanking you in advance for your many courtesies and helping to hear
from you soon, I remain

Sincerely

VIRGIL E. MIRACLE
MSGT, USAF
