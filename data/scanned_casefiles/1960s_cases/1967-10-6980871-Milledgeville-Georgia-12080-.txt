REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
DATE: 6 October 1967 

LOCATION: Milledgeville, Georgia
SUBMITTED BY: Col. Joe Caddis

SUMMARY: On 6 October 1967, at approximately 1915 hours, Mr. Connor S. Beam, Investigator for U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book, received a telephone call from Col. Joe Caddis, Commanding Officer, Milledgeville Air Force Base, regarding a UFO sighting in the Milledgeville, Georgia area.

Col. Caddis stated that several base personnel had witnessed a large, glowing disc-shaped object hovering over a rural area near the base. The object was described as approximately 75-100 feet in diameter, emitting a bright, pulsating light. After several minutes, the object shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

Col. Caddis requested that Mr. Beam travel to Milledgeville to investigate the incident. Mr. Beam arrived on the scene the following day and interviewed several eyewitnesses, including base personnel and local residents. Attached are the witness statements and a photograph taken by one of the observers.

Based on the evidence gathered, Mr. Beam concluded that the object witnessed was indeed an unidentified flying object of unknown origin and nature. The case is being classified as "unresolved" and will be included in the Project Blue Book archives for further analysis.

CASE NO. 1967-6980871 
LOCATION: MILLEDGEVILLE, GEORGIA 
DATE: OCTOBER 6, 1967
REPORT OF F. W. HUTTICK, INVESTIGATOR

On October 6, 1967, I received a report from a witness who claimed to have sighted an unidentified flying object (UFO) near Milledgeville, Georgia. The witness, a local resident, stated that he was in his backyard around 8:20 PM when he noticed a strange object in the sky. 

The witness described the object as a large, dark shape that appeared to be hovering or slowly moving. He reported that the object was silent and emitted no visible lights. The witness claimed to have observed the object for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

I interviewed the witness and found him to be credible. He had no known history of making false reports. I was unable to locate any other witnesses or physical evidence to corroborate the sighting. 

Given the lack of additional information, I am unable to determine the nature of the object observed. This case is classified as unresolved.

CASE 2 MILLEDGEVILLE, GEORGIA - 12 OCTOBER 1967
On 12 October 1967, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Mr. and Mrs. Carl Hickman were traveling on Georgia Highway 22, about 8 miles west of Milledgeville, Georgia, when they observed a bright light in the sky. The light descended rapidly and passed over their automobile at an estimated altitude of 400-500 feet. The object appeared to be round in shape, with a fixed red light on the top and a pulsating white light on the bottom. It was estimated to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. The object hovered for approximately 2 minutes, then accelerated to a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. Mr. Hickman immediately stopped his automobile and he and his wife observed the object for about 2 minutes before it departed. They described the object as making no sound and having no visible means of propulsion.
