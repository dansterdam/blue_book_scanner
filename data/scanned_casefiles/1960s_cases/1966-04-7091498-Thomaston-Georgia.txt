The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a hand-drawn sketch showing the orientation of an object in the sky relative to the horizon. The sketch is accompanied by numbered instructions, indicating that this is likely a questionnaire or survey form for witnesses to fill out.

The text output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made, starting at the beginning of the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
