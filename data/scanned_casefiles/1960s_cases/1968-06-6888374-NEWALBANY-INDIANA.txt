As mentioned on the diagram, this shows the directions of the phenomenon as it was first seen (an "X") and last seen (a "+") in relation to the compass. The handwritten notes provide additional details about the sighting.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "+" WITH A LINE TO GRAPHICALLY SHOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "+". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED, OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS ITEM.

The two smaller sketches show silhouetted figures in a landscape setting, with one figure in the foreground and the other in the background. These are likely meant to illustrate the movement of the phenomenon between the "X" and "+" positions.

ALSO INDICATE ANY PECULIARITIES OR COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR OTHER KNOWN OBJECT OR LIGHT.
Phenomenal appeared to be self-luminous, emitting a light of their own. Considered to be somewhat larger than a star, very much brighter, and seemed more to remain in a position, faint the entire time for approximately 20-30 seconds, and then just seemed to vanish. So it was much slower in movement than a shooting star or meteor and seemed to possess a glow rather than a spark as a shooting star. Scenery illuminated by this "glow" could be observed, indicating the light source was very close to the ground.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
ALTERNATIVE PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

Gentleman:

First of all let me thank you for your cooperation and apologize to you for making your time and causing seemingly unnecessary paperwork.

Since my sighting of this phenomenon and the subsequent thorough investigation that I have made of the details of this incident, I have on previous occasions seen this same blimp in the Dayton area. However, I have always seen it there during daylight hours. When first I sighted this phenomenon, I was so intrigued by the sight of this blimp, however, that I undertook an extensive and careful study of the matter. Unable to locate the particular vehicle.

Even though I feel this report will be of no value to you, I feel it is my duty to fill it out. 

Although it is not pertinent to this report I would like to state that I am a person of the highest character and integrity. He was very kind, considerate, and helpful while talking the necessary information in a professional manner. Due to the nature of his assignment I imagine he was not too comfortable with my constantly playing with a pencil and trying to outline how he might have looked from my view point, however, if possible would you please have his Commanding Officer give him a personal "Thanks" for me.

Respectfully submitted:

The image contains a photograph showing two sketches related to UFO sightings and reporting. The upper sketch is a compass rose with directional markings, likely intended to be used for indicating the direction of a UFO sighting. The lower sketches depict two scenes - one showing a person standing in a landscape with mountains in the background, and the other showing a person standing in a landscape with hills or mountains in the background.

24 June 1968

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

We were sitting and talking on the porch of our home, about 10:30 on a warm evening. Suddenly we saw an object high in the sky in the east, moving rapidly from north to south and getting brighter and larger. As it neared the horizon, it became very bright and lit up the sky around it. Just before it passed below the horizon, it appeared to break up and disappear. It was at high altitude and we could see no wings or any other structural details.

I can not tell what it was, but it was a strange and unusual sight, one that I had never seen before. But I felt a kind of unexplainable dread in my heart, because it was so unexpected.

This page appears to be from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image contains a compass rose diagram with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction to a phenomenon when first seen. Below the compass rose, there are two sketches depicting a person's perspective of a UFO sighting. The sketches show the horizon and landscape from the observer's point of view.

AFR 80-17(CI)
NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "S" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "S" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "S" WITH A LINE TO SHOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "S". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE
SKETCH.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document, excluding the redacted portions:

Complainant advises that it is observed that this is a definite closed circuit flying object round and gray in color
shape, was observed by a number of witnesses, that it was described as approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter and was hovering and maneuvering above the area at approximately 3000 to 4000 feet altitude.
The complainant describes the object as round in shape, silver gray in color, giving off a slight glow, that it made no sound and that it hovered and maneuvered over the area for some 10 to 15 minutes.
This was confirmed at that time by other witnesses in the area.
After a period of time, the object climbed vertically at a high rate of speed and disappeared.
The witnesses were certain that this was not any known type of aircraft. The Project Officer here has had a considerable experience in aviation and from his observation of the object, he stated that this was where the object vanished and the witnesses observed the ground.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
19 July 1968

Subj: UFO Observation, 28 June 1968

Sgt Wall saw something on the night of 28 June 1968 at 9:30-10:00 pm near Grissom, Indiana. The object had white lights and was moving approximately due north. It made no noise and passed directly overhead. Lt Marano thinks he may have observed a plane on low level, high speed bomb run originating from Standifer Field (Bomb run # 4). Lt Marano spoke with the 123 TAG Recon Group, Capt Klar. On the 28th all flights returned by 1927z. On 29th, the first plane to leave was at 0335 local time. Sgt Wall just wanted to inform the Aerial Phenomena Office that he saw something different but did not want to make a UFO report.

when we first sighted it. it was clear, not clouded over, and as near as we could see the objects outline, it seemed to be clear like glass, not dight at all at first. it then began to glow with a light yellowish color and the object seemed to get larger or closer to us, the light got stronger i the very center, and the outline became blurred or hazy, like we could not see the very edge of the object. the light seemed to be coming from within the object, not reflected from anything outside it. it changed directions several times some very abrupt while we watch it, also moved very rapidly at times until it disappeared from my view.

Dayton, Ohio 45420

1. Thank you for your letter of July 15, 1968. Your name was given to the Duty Officer on 5 July 1968 (see attached form letter which would have explained that your name was given to us as a witness to an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation on the night of 5 July 1968). We should have conveyed you the attached form letter which would have explained that your name was given to us as a witness to the observation.

2. We received many reports on the night of 5 July that were identified as being natural astronomical sightings. The plane is a Cessna 1/2 that operates between 50 to 60 mph and when the pilot sighting it could not identify it and it was as far as 15 miles away. The sighting was by a number of persons at various locations in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton, Kettering and Dayton, Ohio on the night of 5 July 1968. We are compiling a report on those sightings which were reported to Wright-Patterson on the nights of 5, 6, and 7 July if you did observe an unusual car on those nights we would appreciate your providing any details.

TO: Major ---
THANK YOU for your letter of July 15, 1968. Your name was given to the Duty Officer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (by telephone) as being a witness to an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation on the night of 5 July 1968. We should have forwarded you the attached form letter, which would have explained that your name was given to us as a witness instead of someone your having reported the observation.

We received many reports on this night-that the night of 5 July that were identified as an aircraft that had an electrical advertising sign attached to it. The plane is a Cessna 172 that operates between 50 to 60 mph and when the sign is lighted, it can be seen as far as 15 miles away. The sign was advertising for Stueve Ford of Miamisburg and was operating in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton, Kettering and Dayton, on the night of 5 July 1968. We are compiling a report on those observation sightings which were reported to Wright-Patterson on the nights of 5, 6, and 7 July.

The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page includes a diagram with a curved trajectory path and a compass-like diagram. There are also instructions for the observer to draw a picture showing the motion and direction of the observed object or objects.

Text from the document:
27. To this indicating device, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon. Place an "B" on the curved line to show how low the object came. If the object made any other significant changes in altitude while you observed it, place additional letter designations to show these changes.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. 

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified object. The sketch appears to depict some kind of aircraft or spacecraft, with lines and shapes that suggest its angular size and movement. There is also some text handwritten below the sketch, which I will transcribe verbatim:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO DO THIS WITH THE OBJECT, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE MATCH WOULD HAVE COVERED THE OBJECT. THIS WILL GIVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT FRACTION OF THE SKY IT OCCUPIED.

Very bright, too bright to see surrounding, seemed to be gradually fading in and out. At times it seemed to be a very intense light, approximately 2 to 3 times the size of a star. It seemed to be stationary and remained in the sky for approximately 15 seconds. I seemed to move for 15 seconds over the direction of the field. However, it was not handled or in front of me.

I first came at it through the trees and it appeared to come out of the woods and go back in. They were round and silver and seemed to be emitting some light as they moved up and down and around rather erratic. There were three of them that I saw first and they seemed to be about twenty feet across and about thirty feet from the ground. Then there were about ten or twelve of them scattered in different places. I thought they might be some kind of new aerial vehicles but they didn't make any noise and they moved around in a very unplane-like manner. They seemed to disappear into the trees and then reappear again. I thought they might be some kind of new device of some kind but I don't know what they could be. I lost sight of them after about an hour or more. There was no indication that any sound was emitted from them at all.

This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with instructions for drawing a picture that shows the shape of the phenomenon and including any details that might indicate the type of phenomenon observed. There is text at the bottom of the page that asks the observer to estimate the angular size of the object based on a physical reference point, such as a familiar object, and to describe how much of the object was covered by the reference.

The text in the document is as follows:

18. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED. SUCH AS SIZE, COLOR, NUMBER OF PARTS, TRAJECTORIES, AND INDICATE STATUS OR MOTION. TRACE OR SKETCH OUTLINES WHEREVER POSSIBLE.

18. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH OR A PENCIL AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR OTHER SMALL OBJECT.

This image does not contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document that appears to be showing daily weather maps from the Department of Commerce/Environmental Science Services Administration.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JUNE 17-23, 1968

The charts in this publication give continuous observations of the principal charts on the Daily Weather Map. They include the surface weather maps for the 500 mb level, and the Daily 30-mb Charts All of the charts are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are comparable to the maps used in daily weather forecasting by the National Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 mb Charts are the same as those used regularly on the Daily Weather Maps.
An explanatory sheet is available and may be obtained by writing to the Environmental Science Services Administration, Rockville, Maryland 20852.
The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. The 500 mb Chart presents the height contours of the 500 mb surface-level weather map for that same time. This chart shows the major weather systems and fronts, both of which are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.
The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. EST. The ranges of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.
The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shaded areas the regions that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for this same period. Incomplete data are indicated by "T" which means a trace of precipitation occurred. Dashed lines on the chart show lines of equal precipitation on the previous day.

The image contains two sketches that appear to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The larger sketch on the top shows a compass rose with directional labels, likely used to indicate the direction and position of a reported UFO sighting. The two smaller sketches at the bottom appear to depict a person's perspective or view of a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "S" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND PLACE A "S" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE. THIS LINE WILL APPROXIMATE THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

The letter mentions that the witness was laying in bed when they noticed the object through the window, which was circular and had a glowing disk shape. The witness called their brother, who also witnessed the object. The letter states that the witness will include a drawing of the object.

Text from the document:

Dear Sirs:
Six days ago when I was laying in bed I became restless. So I rolled over and looked at my window. I was watching the sky. A peculiar distortion was attracting my attention. All of a sudden it became clear to a bright disk shaped object glowing from the center. As I called my brother to come and see it we watched a strange kind of electrical station. It moved closely toward the object. As the object left the end of the disc shped light. It had turned off its bright. We had tried to send what we saw. The time that I saw the clock to 10:15 P.M.

Sincerely,

P.S. I WILL INCLOSE DRAWING OF OBJECT

The image does not contain any photograph. It is a newspaper article with the headline "Not Saucers, Just Lit-Up Planes" discussing the testing of battlefield lights being installed on aircraft, which the article claims are not unidentified flying objects (UFOs) but rather lit-up military planes.

BATTLEFIELD LIGHTS BEING TESTED
Not Saucers, Just Lit-Up Planes
U. that little airplane carrying a lighted ad-
vertising display on a pear of big, glowing-in-
the-dark panels last week, the UFO experts had better
Lone themselves "seatching" for other explanations.

An airplane carrying a battery of high-intensity
floodlights is expected to provide a much better per-
formance than a half-moon on the Air Force base,
possibly around 9:30 p.m., with all lights blazing.

The C-130 HERCULES is equipped with 38
special-lights and reflectors for lighting bat-
tlefield areas, such as those in Vietnam.

It is coming to VPAFE for flight tests from
Greenville, Tex., where the lights were installed
by Lt. Gen. Delmar Wilson.

"It's a startling sight," one Aeronautical Sys-
tems Division official said—"AT 5,000 or 7,000 feet
altitude, the lights can make it merely a giant
firefly."

CALLED BIAS

The lights, mounted in pods on the forward
part of the C-130, may replace the outmoded flare
packs now used to light war zones.

FLYING AT 5,000 feet, the plane can illuminate
an area about a mile in diameter at 2U times
the brightness of full moonlight.

Project officer for BIAS is Maj. William S. 
Paul of TILD Mobility Dr.
The Air Force in 1956 tested an earlier version
of Battlefield Flares mounted in the belly of
a C-13U Provider transport.

The image contains a newspaper clipping with the headline "VIEWERS DISAPPOINTED: It Looked Like a Saucer, Only It Didn't Woosh". The article describes a sighting of what appeared to be a flying saucer over Dayton, Ohio, but the object did not move in the manner expected of a typical flying saucer. The article mentions that the object was "found and spinning" and that there were lights around the edges. However, the object "didn't look like a plane" according to the witnesses.

Transcribed text from the document:

VIEWERS DISAPPOINTED
It Looked Like a Saucer, Only It Didn't Woosh
"Now I'm not crazy and I don't believe in UFOs, but I just can't explain this," the excited man said as he called the police from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Friday night.
A policeman from Wright-Patterson calls reported flying saucers came through several times and again nothing was found.
"It didn't look like a plane. It was round and spinning. And there were lights around the edges," Mrs. Esther Dixon Pike Ave. said.
"I WAS WAITING for it to 'woosh,'" so I could say it was one (a flying saucer), but it was just disappearing and that was disappointing.
"I don't know if we were seeing something new or just something that many people all saw at the same time that was probably an airplane, but I still believe it wasn't." The woman who reported this said she has no scientific background but firmly believes in what she saw. "It just might be something that hasn't been explained yet," she said.
The WPAFB spokesman explained the lights by saying that an automobile dealer in the area was using a revolving lighted sign for advertisement.
"BUT WE CAN'T SAY for sure. If this is something unexplained, we will have to investigate the reports, so we just can't say what it was."
Still Auferman, sales manager of Saunders Ford in Mt. Washington, said the same thing was in the air Friday night and should be in use this weekend.
"We've been using it for four or five years and nobody has ever called before," Auferman said.

DAYTON JOURNAL HERALD 13 JULY 1960

No UFO, But There's A Message!

By Henry Scarupa
Journal Herald Staff Writer

When Kurt Miller glanced up at the sky evenings over Dayton in his downtown office, the people below in the street saw nothing but flying saucers. 

The phone rings repeatedly at the Wright-Patterson Air Force base (WPAFB) command post with reports of strange blinking lights. 

The next day, Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla Jr., head of Project Bluebook, which checks on UFO (Unidentified Flying Objects), calls Montgomery county airport to ask if the single-engine plane was in the air that night.

Miller, as a tall, lanky commercial pilot from Lebanon, Illinois for Barnes serial advertising, based at this airport.

Attached to the underside of the advertising monopolyhone bits is an 88-foot frame, supporting 200 six-foot lights. Activated by a perforated tape, which operates them a second at a time, the aerial "billboard" spells out a continuous advertising message in bright lights.

something like news reports in New York City's Times Square. With good visibility, the flashing message can be seen from the ground within a half-mile radius of the plane, according to Miller. It takes from 15 to 20 seconds for a typical 60-letter business ad to run.

Against the blackness of a night sky, the words appear to be punched out of the sky itself. 

Miller generally holds the plane's speed to about 55 MPH as he flies about 1,000 to 1,200 feet overhead. To people below, surrounded by street lights, the plane's 45 horsepower engine is barely audible.

The UFO alarm is usually sounded by individuals too far away to read the message, but close enough to discern the flashing lights moving mysteriously across the sky.

Recently a Journal Herald re­porter accompanied Miller on a test flight over Dayton, serving as a crew member handling the advertising message controls.

At 9:20 p.m. as dusk was fall­ing, Miller guided the small red and white plane into the air, and leveled off at 1,400 feet. Below them the lights blinked as if in response to the plane's lights flashing on the plane's underside. The advertising night was about to satu­rate Dayton with a commercial.

While pointed about to a heavy cluster of lights streaming from below, Miller guided a string of 4-13 and Main street. The plane circled low over Third and Main streets, past the darkened mass of the Great Miami river, on up to another brighly lighted Ken­tucky side with Dixie districts and Cincinnati, Ohio near.

"I try to cover all the main streets by 10:30," Miller said. "After the people are in bed and in their backyards, I can give them a little residential area and they can view the lights."

To most observers who would "piously" saturate Dayton would take down four to five hours, Miller estimated.

Making a radio contact with Cec. Municipal airport, Miller told the tower he would be in the airspace alongside of Dayton for the next 15 minutes. This information, in turn, was relayed by the tower to planes leaving and entering at Cox.

Miller's job frequently takes him to Indianapolis, northern Kentucky and Cincinnati, where he advertises the Dayton Covley field for an hour during a night baseball game.

"I had three messages that night," Miller said. "Between flying and working the console I was busier than a one-armed paper hanger."

He says there was no time to watch the same.

Miller has also flown longer contract jobs over Chicago, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. There are only 20 aircraft of this type in the country, he said.

Before venturing into a new area, Miller tries to make at least one daylight flight to orient himself and to observe dangerous obstructions to avoid, such as tall obstacles and T-towers.

Scanning downward after Day­ton, Miller perceived the 1,400 feet antenna of WHO-TV, Red lights blinked steadily on the side of the steel-frame structure. Miller veered sharply away to safety.

Being a "UFO" pilot has other hazards, Miller said. Several years ago a farmer pulled a shotgun on an advertising plane down by Dale Barnes. The guy lost a wing. Through the chaos, the pilot continued on, but failed to hit a vital part.

From time to time Miller gets an irate phone call from a little­downtown woman who identifies herself as a member of a so­ciety that believes in UFO's. She calls Miller a "freak" and the Air Force, stating that the military wants to believe the fact there are true UFO's visiting earth.

Miller, who flies two or three hours an evening, likes seeing the lights "as I guess it's the lights," he remarked. "It's like Christmas every day. When you look up, it's beautiful."

NO UFO, BUT THERE'S A MESSAGE!

What Kurt Miller, a bartender in Dayton, saw in the skies over Dayton in his Cessna 172 "pipers" began to see "flying saucers".

This phone rings repeatedly at the Wright-Patterson Air Force base (WPAFB) command post with reports of strange blinking lights.

The next day, Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla Jr., head of Project Bluebook at WPAFB which looks into UFO sightings (unidentified flying objects), calls Montegomery county airport where a single-engine plane was up the night before.

Miller, 25, a tall, lanky commercial pilot from Lebanon, Pa., was an NBC news dealer as Bar Barnes aerial advertising. Attached to the underside of his Piper Cub were 300 shaving messages he plopped out at random.

At 9:39 p.m. as dusk was falling, Miller guided the small red and white plane into the air, and leveled off at 1,400 feet. Below were 3 thousand of Dayton's lights blinking as if in response to the plane's underside. The advertising that attached to his plane is barely visible.

Miller pointed ahead to a heavy cluster of lights stretching along like a string of pearls - it was the Main Street, The below cloud was over Main Street, and the darkened mass of the Green Hills Mall area was eerily lighted. Suddenly the flashing lights moving mysteriously across the sky stopped as a Dayton Herald reporter accompanied Miller on a flight over Dayton, serving as a crew member handling the advertising console.

At 9:39 p.m. as dusk was falling, Miller guided the small red and white plane into the air, and leveled off at 1,400 feet. Below were 3 thousand of Dayton's lights blinking as if in response to the plane's underside. The advertising that attached to his plane is barely visible.

The UFO alarm is usually sounded by individuals too far away to read the message, looking enough to discern the flashing lights moving mysteriously across the sky.
Recently a Dayton Herald reporter accompanied Miller on a flight over Dayton, serving as a crew member handling the advertising console.

Making a radio contact with Cox Municipal airport, Miller told the tower he would be in the southeast quadrant for the next 15 minutes. This information, in turn, was relayed by the side of the steel-frame structure of the tower, to planes leaving and landing for safety.

Being a "UFO" pilot has other hazards, Miller said. Several years ago a farmer blasted a shotgun at an advertising plane flown by Miller, rows, while mistaking the lights for a UFO. The plane ends up away from a gasoline tank, but failed to hit a vital part.

From time to time Miller gets on irate phone calls from a middle-down woman who identifies herself as a member of a society that believes in UFOs. She calls Miller a "fly" for the Air Force, arguing that the military wants to behead the fact there are UFO's visiting earth.
Miller, who flies two or three hours an evening, likes fast flying and working the console. "I guess it's the lights," he remarked. "It's like Christmas every day. When you look down at night, everything seems brighter."

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service
DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JUNE 24-30, 1968
The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau.
The Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in the Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available, and may be obtained by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AD 142, Rockville, Maryland 20852.
The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather reports on which the analyses are based. Occasional departures between the printed station data and the analyses result from those stations reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.
The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The temperature isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.
The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.
The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredths of an inch are for the same period. (Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.)
