1. DATE - TIME GROUP
30 Jun 68
2130 CDT Lmn/0230z

2. LOCATION
NEW ALBANY, INDIANA

3. SOURCE
CIVILIAN

10. CONCLUSION
PROBABLE AIRCRAFT

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
ONE

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted an egg shaped object that had a blue light on it and also four red lights that formed a square.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
FIVE MINS

COMMENTS: An AF Form 117 was sent to the witness, but he has not returned it as of 3 Sep 68. The observer has been reading UFO literature. In particular about the Scorce, New Mexico sightings. The Stanford Municipal Airport at Roswell, Kentucky is only about ten miles south of New Albany. No one else from the area reported seeing a similar object to us this night. Because of the young age of the observer, lack of substantiating evidence and his proximity to a large commercial airport, it is felt he probably saw an aircraft.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
GROUND VISUAL

[Handwritten note:]
I am very sorry you feel obliged to send us these forms, since we called the Field the same night to advise you that what we thought was an UFO turned out to be a plane advertising Steve Ford. We verified this with South Dayton Airport, who reportedly had been delayed with calls. They didn't have the direction of the flying vessel, the plane appeared to be hovering - I wish we could report an actual sighting for you!

"UFO" WAS MOVING VERY SLOW
AND HAD A WEIRD AFFECT ON OUR BOOKS.
IT CAME DOWN OUT OF THE
SKY AND WENT HIGHER THEN
STOP TURNED UPRIGHT, AND THEN
SHOT UP IN THE SKY. YOU COULD
SEE IT GO OUT OF SIGHT, THAT'S
WHEN IT MADE A SMOOSH
SOUND, THAT'S ALSO WHEN WE GOT
SHAKING AND OUR HEARTS START
BEATING FASTER.

So, read the article about Lonnie
Zamora's egg, all I saw in Martin
his description is similar to mine.

Gentleman:

First of all let me thank you for your cooperation and apologize to you for wasting your time and causing seemingly unnecessary paperwork.

Since my spotting of this phenomenon and the receipt of this questionnaire I have found out that I saw that night was nothing more than an advertising blimp. I have on previous occasions seen this blimp in the Dayton area. However I have always soon it during the daylight hours. When first sighting the phenomenon, I though of this blimp, however at one point this object seemed very close and yet I was unable to make out any words and I couldn't hear any noise no associated with the vehicle.

Even though I feel this report will be of no value to your research, since the sig ting is so easily explained, I felt that if your people took the time to send the questionnaire it was my duty to fill it out.

Although it is not pertinent to this report I would like to personally congratulate the man that was on duty at the time I reported this sighting. His personal demeanor was of the highest quality. He was very kind, considerate, and helpful while taking the necessary information in a professional manner. Due to the nature of his assignment I imagine he would be constantly plagued with "Crank" calls and I can understand how he could easily become disgusted. He displayed the utmost courtesy. If possible would you please have his Commanding Officer give him a personal "Thanks" for me. Thank You.

Respectfully submitted;

We were sitting out talking on the porch. I saw something on the sky. One a golden like moving from left to my right. I showed it to my group and we called our children playing nearby. But when they did come outside, it disappeared, then appearing went behind the trees and disappeared again. I now saw in my life colors like that bright golden with dark sparkles on it.

I am not tell that was it, because it was so short in time and because I never saw something like that before.

But I felt dread in my heart because it was unexplainable.

Writer officer feels that subject was unable to keep his story straight and was caught in a lie when asked to excuse his actions in the backyard. The excuse he used was this imaginary object floating in the sky.

The story then went out to his friends and from an effort of them was unable to back him up or admit he was lying.

This case can be closed with the contact of the complainant and his acknowledgment that it was just his imagination and that he did not actually see any flying objects.

Sky & Telescope Sept'68

SOME RECENT FIREBALLS
SEVERAL readers of this magazine
have reported sightings of four fireballs during early summer. Though each
was conspicuous and occurred over a
populated area, only one was described by
two observers.

June 29th. At 11:10 p.m. Eastern daylight time, William E. Rison of Pisgah,
Maryland, saw a brilliant greenish fireball
of magnitude -10. For about three seconds it moved across Pegasus, which was
rising in the east.

July 2nd. This fireball, traveling in a
northwesterly direction, was widely observed from the northeast area. At
about 9:25 p.m. EDT, Mrs. Gloria A.
Jajich viewed the meteor from her yard
at York, Pennsylvania. She writes:
"Under a cloudy sky, I saw a green
ball, bright enough to cast a shadow,
come out of the southeast. It traveled
60° above and parallel to the northeastern horizon, and covered 110° of sky in
five seconds. Its head appeared half the
size of the full moon, and streaming from
it was a bright red tail approximately
31/2° long. No train was seen, nor any
sound heard."

This fireball was also spied by Paul
Repak as it hailed southwest of Lowville, New York, 270 miles north of Mt.
Jajich. He reports:

"Although the sky was covered by thin
altocumulus clouds, the bolide's colors
and outline were prominent. At 9:25
p.m. EDT, I first noticed it only 25°
above the southwest horizon, as a bright
green object 20" in diameter with a green
tail 11/2° long. At first, it was completely
surrounded by a deep orange glow, but
turned intense yellow-orange when it expanded, after moving horizontally only 5°.
No enduring train could be detected."

July 4th. While plotting meteor during a three-hour session, John West
of Bryan, Texas, saw a fireball of magnitude -8 or -9 in Cygnus, which was then
overhead. The meteor appeared at 2:03
a.m. Central daylight time and moved
eastward. It shone blue-green at first,
then red as it brightened, and finally
appeared white along the middle of its
path, where it trailed short-lived
sparks.

The fireball took 31/2 seconds to travel
50°, and a train no longer than 3° was
left. No sound was heard during the
flight, but about two minutes later two
closely spaced "chugs" occurred.

Mr. West, who has plotted 600 meters
in the last 21 months, gave the visible
track as from right ascension 19h 48m,
declination +3°, to 23h 19m, -10°.

July 21st. Thomas Hickey, Jr. reported his failure to observe a meteor of
magnitude -3 from Westport, Connecticut. It was seen at 9:01 p.m. EDT, and
was visible for two seconds as it passed
about 40 degrees above the horizon to
the northeast. The fireball had a
white conic head, and left a white-yellow

SOME RECENT FIREBALLS
SEVERAL readers of this magazine have reported sightings of four fireballs during early summer. Though each was conspicuous and occurred over a popular area, only one was described by two observers.

June 29th. At 11:10 p.m. Eastern day light time, William E. Rison of Pisgah, Maryland, saw a brilliant greenish fireball of magnitude -10. For about three seconds it moved across Pegasus, which was rising in the east.

July 2nd. This fireball, traveling in a northwesterly direction, was widely observed from the northeastern states. At about 9:25 p.m. EDT, Mrs. Gloria A. Jajich viewed the meteor from her yard at York, Pennsylvania. She writes:

"Under a cloudy sky, I saw a green ball, bright enough to cast a shadow, come out of the southeast. It traveled 60° above and parallel to the northeastern horizon, and covered 110° of sky in five seconds. Its head appeared half the size of the full moon, and streaming from it was a bright red tail approximately 34° long. No train was seen, nor any sound heard."

This fireball was also spied by Paul Repak as it flashed southwest of Lowville, New York, 270 miles north of Mrs. Jajich. He reports:

"Although the sky was covered by thin altocumulus clouds, the bolide's colors and outline were prominent. At 9:25 p.m. EDT, I first noticed it only 25° above the southwest horizon, as a bright green object 20° in diameter with a green tail 1½° long. At first, it was completely surrounded by a deep orange glow, but turned intense yellow-orange when it exploded, after moving horizontally only 4°. No enduring train could be detected."

July 6th. While plotting meteors during a three-hour session, John West of Bryan, Texas, saw a fireball of magnitude -8 or -9 in Cygnus, which was then overhead. The meteor appeared at 2:03 a.m. Central daylight time and moved eastward. It shone blue-green at first, then red as it brightened, and finally appeared white along the middle of its path, where it trailed short-lived red sparks.

The fireball took 3½ seconds to travel 50°, and a train no longer than 3° was left. No sound was heard during the flight, but about two minutes later two closely spaced "whumps" occurred.

Mr. West, who has plotted 600 meteors in the last 21 months, gave the visible track as from right ascension 19h 48m, declination +31°, to 23h 31m, -10°.

July 21st. Thomas Hickey, Jr., reported a fireball of magnitude -3 from Westport, Connecticut. At was seen at 9:01 p.m. EDT, and was visible for two seconds as it passed the horizon to the north-northeast. The fireball had a white cone head, and left a white-yellow

UFO Observation, 5 July 1968

Mr [redacted]
Dayton, Ohio 45420

1. Thank you for your letter of July 15, 1968. Your name was given to the Duty Officer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (by telephone) as being a witness to an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation on the night of 5 July 1968. We should have forwarded you the attached form letter which would have explained that your name was given to us as a witness instead of your having reported the observation.

2. We received many reports on the night of 5 July that were identified as an aircraft that had an electrical advertising sign attached to it. The plane is a Cessna 172 that operates between 50 to 60 mph and when the sign is lighted, it can be seen as far as 15 miles away. The sign was advertising for Stueve Ford of Miamisburg and was operating in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton, Kettering and Dayton, on the night of 5 July 1968. We are compiling a report on those sightings which were reported to Wright-Patterson on the nights of 5, 6, and 7 July. If you did observe something unusual on the night of 5 July, we would appreciate your completing the attached AF Form 117.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

I have talked to others who have seen this at the same time. A man & woman at West Carrolton, said there was no letter on it or no sound & perceived at the same as I.

A public officer stepped by me as I was looking over Salem Ave. and asked me if I "saw that thing too"!

A kid down the street said about the same time he was walking through town & said he could read. Steward Ford in lights.

So I don't know what to believe - I believe only that it was the Typical Sight, no sound. Weird shape of a U.F.O.

DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Environmental Science Service Administration/Environmental Data Service

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES   JUNE 17-23, 1968

The charts in this publication show a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Maps and may be obtained by writing to Environmental Science Services Administration, Section AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analysis result from those stations reports that cannot be included because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature isotherms of the 500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The temperature indications are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are in the scale legend. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground at 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

DEAR SIRS:

Six days ago when I was laying in bed became restless. So I rolled over and looked out my window. I was watching the skys on the opposite side of the Miami-River when my attention was attracted to a glowing disk shaped object appearing from the Southeast. At its closest it was abot Forty ft. long. I called my brother and some kind of electrical station was slowly moved across the station it was in sight for at least 4 min. As it reached the end of the station it turned off its light. We had the object in sight between 10:10 and 10:10:8 P.M. I saw the clock before the object was between 10 and 10:10 P.M.

Sincerely;

P.S. I WILL INCLUDE DRAWING OF OBJECT

An airplane carrying a battery of high-intensity floods, it's expected to arrive at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, possibly around 9:30 or 10 p.m. with all lights blazing.

THE C-130 HERCULES is equipped with 28 seven-arc lamps and reflectors for lighting battlefield areas, such as those in Vietnam.

Greenville, Tex., where the lights were installed by LAV Electronics.

"It's a startling sight," one aeronautical source division official said. "At 7,000 or 8,000 feet altitude, the lights can make a mighty as bright as day."

CALLED BIAS for battlefield illumination are lamps so a wide area of the battlefield.

Each of the 28 lights is said to be 25 million candlepower. Together they give out more than 15 million candlepower.

The lights, mounted in pods on the forward part of the C-130 may replace artillery searchlights in Vietnam combat areas.

FLYING AT 5,000 feet, the plane can illuminate an area about a mile in diameter at 20 times the brightness of full moonlight.

Project officer for this is Maj. William S. Peel of Hill Aerospace.

The Air Force in 1966 tested an earlier version of battlefield floodlights, mounted in the belly of a C-130 Hercules transport.

The image appears to be a weather map with various contour lines, annotations of "HIGH" and "LOW" pressure systems, and numerous small markings representing weather data points. The map covers a large geographic area and includes multiple panels showing different weather-related visualizations.

At the bottom of the page, there are two additional panels: one showing more contour lines and another showing what seems to be a grid or scatter plot of data points.

The text is mostly limited to the date at the top of the page and various weather-related annotations on the map itself.

VIEWERS DISAPPOINTED

It Looked Like a Saucer,
Only It Didn't Woosh

"Now I'm not crazy and I
don't believe in UFO's, but I
just can't explain this," the
excited man said as he called
to report strange lights in the
sky over Dayton Friday night.

"I WAS WAITING for it to
go 'woosh' so I could say it
was one (a flying saucer), but
it just disappeared behind
some trees," she said, sounding disappointed.

A spokesman from Wright-
Patterson Air Force base said
calls reporting flying saucers
came throughout the night and
continued Saturday morning.

"I find myself not believing
reports of UFOs but I'm still
of the school that believes it
just might be possible," Mrs.
Bohachek said.

"It didn't look like a plane.
It was round and spinning,
not rapidly, and there were
lights around the edge," Mrs.
Richard Bohachek of 86 E.
Dixon Ave. said.

Was it? Could it be?

The WPAEB spokesman explained that the lights by saying
that an automobile dealer in
Miamisburg was using a plane
pulling a revolving lighted sign

for advertisement.

"BUT WE CAN'T SAY for
sure," the spokesman said.
"Someone from our UFO office will have to investigate
the reports, so we just can't
say what it was."

Bill Auferman, sales manager of Steuve Ford in Miamisburg, said the flying sign
was in the air Friday night
and should be in use this
week end.

"We've been using it for four
or five weeks, and nobody
has called before," Auferman
said.

DAYTON JOURNAL HERALD 15 July 1968

No UFO, But There's A Message!

By Henry Scarupa
Journal Herald Staff Writer

When Kurt Miller takes to the air evenings over Dayton in his Cessna 172, people begin to see flying saucers.

The phone rings repeatedly at the Wright-Patterson Air Force base (WPAFB) command post with reports of strange blinking lights.

The next day, Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, Jr., head of Project Bluebook at WPAFB which checks on UFOs (unidentified flying objects), calls Montgomery county airport to ask if the unidentified plane was up the night before.

Miller, 25, a tall, lanky commercial pilot from Lebanon, flies for Barnes aerial advertising, based at the airport.

Attached to the underside of the highway monochute is a pilot's lot is an 8x5-foot frame, supported by 300 watt lights. Activated by a perforated tape, which operates from a console in the cabin, the aerial "billboard" spells out a continuous advertising message in bright lights.

Something like news reports in New York City's Times Square.

With good visibility, the flashing message can be seen from the ground within a half-mile to a mile radius of the plane, according to Miller. It takes from 15 to 20 seconds for a typical 8-letter message to run.

Against the blackness of a dark night, the words appear to be punched out of the sky itself.

Miller generally holds the plane's speed to about 65 MPH at 1,000 to 1,400 feet overhead, to people below, surrounded by street noise, the plane's 15 horsepower engine is barely audible.

The UFO alarm is usually sounded by individuals to far away to read the message, but close enough to discern the flashing lights moving mysteriously across the sky.

Recently a Journal Herald reporter accompanied Miller on a flight over Dayton, serving as a crew member handling the advertising console.

At 9:20 p.m. as dusk was falling, Miller guided the small red and white plane into the air, and leveled off at 1,400 feet.

Below tens of thousands of lights blinked as if in response to the white lights flashing on the plane's underside. The advertising that night was for a Miamisburg car dealer.

Miller pointed ahead to a heavy cluster of lights stretching northward like a string of jewels -15 and Main Street. The plane downed on over Third and Main streets, past the darkened mass of the Great Miami river and over brightly lighted Kettering field, tall diamonds and lights course.

"I try to cover all the main streets by 10:30," Miller said. "After that people are at home and in their backyards. Then I cover the residential areas and suburbs."

To thoroughly "saturate" Dayton would take from four to five hours, Miller estimated.

Making radio contact with Cox Municipal airport, Miller told the tower he would be in the southeast quadrant for the next 15 minutes. This information, in turn, was relayed by the tower, to planes leaving and arriving at Cox.

Miller's job frequently takes him to Indianapolis, northern Kentucky and Cincinnati, where recently he circled Crosley field for an hour during a night baseball game.

"I had three messages," Miller said, "between flying and working the console. I was busier than a one-armed paperhanger."

He says there was no time to watch the game.

Miller has also flown larger contract jobs over Chicago, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. There are only 10 aircraft of this type in the country, he said.

Before moving into a new area, Miller tries to make at least one daytime flight to orient himself and to observe danger points to avoid, such as tall smokestacks and TV towers.

Swinging westward over Dayton, Miller approached the 1,104 foot antenna of WHIO-TV. Red lights blinked ominously on the side of the steel-frame structure.

Miller veered sharply away to safety.

Being a "UFO" pilot, Miller said, has other hazards. Several years ago a farmer blasted a shotgun at an advertising plane from by Miller's box, Dale Barnes. The slug tore a hole through a wing four feet away from a gasoline tank, but failed to hit a vital part.

From time to time Miller gets an irate phone call from a Middletown woman who identifies herself as a member of a society that believes in UFOs.

She calls Miller a "front" for the Air Force, arguing that the military wants to befuddle the fact there are true UFOs visiting earth.

Miller, who flies two or three hours an evening, likes night flying.

"I guess it's the lights," he remarked. "It's like Christmas every day. When you look down at night, everything seems beautiful."

No UFO, But There's A Message!

By Henry Scarupa

When Kurt Miller takes to the air evenings over Dayton in his Cessna 172, people begin to see something like news reports in New York City's Times Square.

The phone rings repeatedly at the Wright-Patterson Air Force base (WPAFB) command post with reports of strange blinking lights.

The next day, Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla Jr., head of Project Bluebook at WPAFB which checks on UFOs (unidentified flying objects), calls Miller's county airport to ask if the single-engine plane was up the night before.

Miller, 25, a tall, lanky commercial pilot from Lebanon, flies for Barnes aerial advertising, based at the airport.

Attached to the underside of the highway's moonplane he pilots is an 8x5-foot frame, supporting 200 six-volt lights. Activated by a perforated tape, which operates from a console in the cabin, the aerial "billboard" spells out a continuous advertising message in bright lights.

With good visibility, the flashing message can be seen from the ground within a half-mile to a mile radius of the plane, according to Miller. It takes from 15 to 20 seconds for a typical 40-letter message to run.

Against the blackness of a dark night, the words appear to be punched out of the sky itself.

Miller generally holds the plane's speed to about 65 MPH as he flies lazily at 1,000 to 1,400 feet overhead. To people below, surrounded by street noises, the plane's 15 horsepower engine is hardly audible.

The UFO alarm is usually sounded by individuals too far away to read the message, but close enough to discern the flashing lights moving mysteriously across the sky.

Recently a Journal Herald reporter accompanied Miller on a flight over Dayton, serving as a crew member, handling the advertising console.

Below tens of thousands of lights blinked as if in response to the white lights flashing on the plane's underside. The advertising that night was for a Miamisburg car dealer.

Miller pointed ahead to a heavily clustered area of lights stretching northward like a string of jewels —1-75 and Main street. The plane skewed on over Third and Main streets, past the darkened mass of the Great Miami river and over brightly lighted Kentucky field ball diamonds and tennis courts.

"Up to cover all the main streets by 10:30," Miller said. "After that people are at home in their backyards. Then I cover the residential areas and the suburbs."

To thoroughly "saturate" Dayton would take from four to five hours, Miller estimated.

"I had three messages that night," Miller said. "Between flying and working the console I was busier than a one-armed paperhanger."

He says there was no time to watch the game.

Miller has also flown longer contract jobs over Chicago, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. There are only 10 aircraft of this type in the country, he said.

Before moving into a new area, Miller tries to make at least one daytime flight to orient himself and to observe danger points to avoid, such as tall smokestacks and TV towers.

Swinging westward over Dayton, Miller again skimmed the 1,104 foot antenna of WHIO-TV. Red lights blinked ominously on the side of the steel-frame structure.

Miller veered sharply away to safety.

Being a "UFO" pilot has other hazards, Miller said. Several years ago a farmer blasted a shotgun at an advertising plane from by Miller's boss, Dale Barnes. The slug tore a hole through a wing four feet away from a gasoline tank, but failed to hit a vital part.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JUNE 24-30, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available, and may be obtained by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The temperature isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m./e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.
