11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Objects were a little larger than a star. They were alternately red, green, and white in color. Cahill objects were widely separated. One object moved rapidly to the north, left a trail similar to fireworks rocket and was visible for one minute. Other two objects remained stationary and were in sight for 30 minutes at which time observer got tired of watching them. Moving object faded from sight on course. Stationary objects were low in the west and were probably the planet JUPITER and the star SIRIUS. Moving object is consistent with an aircraft sighting.
