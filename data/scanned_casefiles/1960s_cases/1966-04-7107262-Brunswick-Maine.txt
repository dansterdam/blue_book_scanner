The objects were a little larger than a star. They were alternately red and white in color. The objects were widely separated and were visible for about one minute. They appeared similar to fireworks rocket and were visible for one minute. Rotating objects descended stationary and were in sight for 30 minutes at which time observers got tired of watching them. The ARMS (stars/planets) were low in the west and were probably the planets JUPITER and the SUN CIRRUS.
