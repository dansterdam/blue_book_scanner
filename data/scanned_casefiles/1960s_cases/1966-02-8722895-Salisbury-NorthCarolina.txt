Observers watched a silver colored object, without noise, moving at a constant speed, descending and ascending at a fast and unusual rate, not in a straight line but darting around in different directions, alighting on the ground for approximately 15 seconds, and taking off straight up and disappearing in the night sky. The object had revolving lights that seemed to be coming from its exterior. The object hovered after landing for about 15 minutes, then moved off to the north. The weather was clear.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

Enclosed is a copy of a record that I have made of this report that I have received from the General Scientific Studies Division, U.S. Air Force, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. 

This report is interesting because of the general skeptical attitude that has been shown in the handling of it. This report seems to indicate that there is something of interest in the area and that this interest has some considerable substance to it.

I do not see that I can add anything further, except to say that I have done what I can to convince myself that there is nothing of interest here. However, I have not been able to do so, and the report in the shape that it is seems to indicate that there is something here that is worth pursuing.

I would appreciate your comments on this matter, if you have the time.

Sincerely yours,
Reginald H. Brown

February 3, 1966

On the night of February 2, 1966, the witness turned out the lights and saw an unidentified object hovering and slowly turning in the sky. The object appeared to be round or elliptical in shape and emitted a bright light that lit up the area around it. The witness observed the object for about 10 minutes before it moved away rapidly.

The text describes the witness's account of the sighting, including details about the object's appearance, movement, and duration of the observation. There is no photograph or image included in this document.
