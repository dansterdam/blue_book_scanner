27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

my mother and I were driving North-west along Los Gatos-Sara-toga Road when we first sighted the object. It was a bright pulsating Light which seemed to do stunts in the air. We stopped of a stop light & I got out of the truck & watched the object until the light changed. Then we drove northeast along Highway 9 when the object started to zoom away at a 90° angle at a fast rate of speed, about 500 to 600 mph then it disappeared through the clouds.

Los Gatos
Calif
95030

Dear Sirs,

I would like to report a UFO.
My mother and I sighted it on
the 23rd of Dec. over Saratoga
Calif. We live at [redacted] Rd.
Los Gatos, California, 95030. The
object was a very very bright wit
pulsating light. It was star like
in shape. The sighting lasted
approx. 15 min. the object moved
in a south-westerly direction. The
object seemed to be doing stunts
in the air. We sighted a similar
object in June of 68 only the
object was gold & only stayed
in sight for about 3 min. Then
it sort of exploded & was gone
but there was no sound of an
explosion.

Very Truly
