UNCLASSIFIED

The image appears to be a grainy black and white photograph with a white/bright object in the center against a textured background, but most of the details are obscured by the low image quality.


- page 8 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

UNCLASSIFIED (appears twice, at top right and bottom left of the page)

The rest of the document appears to be a very low quality, grainy black and white scanned image where the text is illegible due to poor image quality and heavy noise/static-like interference across the entire page.


- page 9 -

The image appears to be a grainy black and white photograph with a white or light-colored elongated object in the center of a dark, textured background. Most of the image is obscured by noise and poor image quality, making it difficult to discern specific details. The object appears to be teardrop or bullet-shaped and is positioned vertically in the center of the image.

No legible text is visible in this image.
