Subject: Sighting Report - Extraordinary
To: Smithsonian Visual Tracking Center
20 Garden St., Cambridge 38, Mass.

Sir:

1. After consulting with Mr. ______ who heads the K. C. Moon Watch, I submit the following:

a. Date/Time: 17 April 1960; 1429-1431.5 GMT - 6 hrs = 8:30 am CST
b. Location: Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri; 20 miles south of KC
c. Weather: Fair - Temperature 40°F.
d. Sky Conditions: Clear - no moon

2. Sighting made with both unaided eye and six inch Newtonian telescope.

a. Object sighted initially 1429 GMT north or belt in Orion - 30° above horizon. Object moving in east-southeast direction; it passed 1° south of Sirius falling below horizon at 1431.5 GMT. Color, a reddish glow. Object surrounded by what appeared to be a faint bluish halo. Angular size about 2 minutes of arc.
b. The angular rate of change of the object appeared to increase from 2°/minute - estimated in Orion - to 15°/minute as it passed near Sirius. Altitude, color, and size did not appear to change.

3. Mr. ____ a Field Representative LINK, and I were viewing M-42 in Orion through the telescope. We noticed a small star-like point of light enter the field of view and traverse the field from top to bottom. This was no aircraft. Then we checked the object's track. At first we thought it to be a pale object but on checking it, we came to the conclusion that it was a definite object. In a desperate effort I got the object in the narrow field of my telescope. Unfortunately I did not get a good focus.

4. Did we observe a vehicle of the Discoverer class on reentry just prior to its becoming a fire-ball?

Respectfully
s/Jim C. Ford
Major, USAF
