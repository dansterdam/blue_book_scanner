Subject: Sighting Report - Extraordinary                                                18 April 1960

To: Smithsonian Visual Tracking Center
60 Garden St., Cambridge 38, Mass.

Sir:

1. After consulting with Mr. [redacted] who heads the K. C. Moon Watch,
I submit the following:

a. Date/Time:  17 April 1960; 1429-1431.5 GMT  -6 hrs = 8:30 am CST

b. Location: Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri. 20 miles south of
K. C. MO.

c. Weather:  Fair  - Temperature 40°F.

d. Sky Condition: clear-no moon

e. Sighting made with both unaided eye and six inch Newtonian telescope
with one inch eye piece - 16x.

f. Object sighted initially 1429 GMT north of belt in Orion - 30° above
horizon--estimated. Moving in arc toward southwest, passed 1° south of
Sirius falling below horizon at 1431.5 GMT. Color, a reddish glow. Object
subtended 5 seconds of arc--estimated--with undetermined profile. During
sighting period there was no apparent change in either size, color, or magnitude.
The angular rate of change of the object appeared to increase from 2°/minute--
estimated-- in Orion to 1°/second at last sighting.

2. Mr. [redacted], Field Representative LINK, and I were viewing M-42
in Orion when this spectacle occurred. We sensed we were seeing something
extraordinary. The first 30 seconds we watched and debated the origin of the
light. This was no aircraft. Then we checked the objects track. At first we
thought it to be a polar orbit. But on checking its track the
celestial polar axis and orbit near 45° appeared more reasonable. In a desperate
effort I got the object in the narrow field of my telescope. Unfortunately I
did not get a good focus.

3. Did we observe a vehicle of the Discoverer class on reentry just prior to
its becoming a fire-ball?

Respectfully
s/Jim G. Ford
Major, USAF
