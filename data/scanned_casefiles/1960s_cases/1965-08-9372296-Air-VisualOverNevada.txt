TO: TDEW/UFO

The description of the flight path and maneuvers during the 3 hour and
15 minutes the observations were made is insufficient to allow a meaningful
evaluation to be made. However, the description as "stopped, started,
and made right hand climbs" infers movements not compatible with aircraft
targets. A possible explanation for this radar sighting could be a
so-called "bubble" in the atmosphere which could cause a radar reflection,
and conceivably might cause a visual observation as well. Such a "bubble"
could fall in the category of weather phenomenon, as suggested by personnel
at the Winnemucca radar site.
