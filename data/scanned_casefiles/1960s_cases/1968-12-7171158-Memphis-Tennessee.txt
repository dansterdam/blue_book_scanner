11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer reported to Duty Officer that he saw a saucer shaped craft on 12 December 1968. The craft was about 200 to 300 yards away, traveled at mach 1.2 and was seen for 5 seconds. In the AF Form 117 that he returned he stated that he saw the object on 11 December 1968. The object was about 300 yards away, traveled at mach 2.8 and was seen for 5 to 5 minutes.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW THE MOVEMENT APPENDED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
