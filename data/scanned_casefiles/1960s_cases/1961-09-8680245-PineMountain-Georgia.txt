Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality. There are some faint handwritten lines of text visible, but they cannot be clearly read. The bottom portion of the page contains two horizontal black redaction/censorship bars. The rest of the page appears to be a white or off-white document page with a vertical line on the right side.


- page 2 -

The text I can discern on this document is:

TD-E

There is also a postmark/stamp visible in the top right of the document, but the text within it is not clearly legible. Some of the text appears to be obscured or blacked out.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Your recent letter to the Air Technical Intelligence Center has been referred to this office for reply.

The information furnished in your letter is not detailed enough for us to make any conclusion as to what was seen by your mother and son on September 25, 1961. So that we may have more detailed information, I am enclosing two questionnaires for your mother and son to complete. Please forward them in the enclosed pre-addressed envelope. No stamp will be necessary.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
Major, USAF
