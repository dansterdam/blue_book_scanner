City Will Get
Better View
Of Satellite

Echo 1, the satellite that people have been seeing at since
it was sent aloft early last month, will become easier to see
this week, and next week it passes over Dayton, according to George Levy, Goddard director.

It is visible for only a few minutes now since it glides into
the earth's shadow shortly after
it is seen out of the horizon.

Here is a list, compiled by
Levy, of the best times to
watch it this week:

Today-8:15 p.m., moving northwest out of the southwest,
515 p.m., moving northeast
out of the west.

Tomorrow-14 p.m., moving southwest out of the southwest, 515 p.m., moving northwest
out of the west.

Wednesday-17 p.m., moving northwest out of the southwest, 515 p.m., moving northwest
out of the southwest.

Thursday-18 p.m., moving out of the southwest and entering into the earth's shadow almost 90 degrees, about 515 p.m., out of the west.

Friday-19 p.m., moving out of the southwest, 525 p.m., moving out of the west.

Saturday-21 p.m., moving out of the west.
