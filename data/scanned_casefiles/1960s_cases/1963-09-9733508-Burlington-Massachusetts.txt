Gentlemen:

I am Fourteen years old and I am reporting something which I saw about a month ago. About nine thirty my friend and I were looking at the constellations when we saw a glowing object moving across the sky. All of a sudden it seemed to blow up, and a bright clear came after it. From the close came a white cloud, but finally dispersed. I would like to know what it could have been.

Also I would like to report that I have seen a few "Unidentified Flying Objects" around my town. My friends and I are all interested in the "U.F.O. Aerial Phenomena" and "Project Blue Book" and are always looking up at the sky for 2 J.F.O.'s

Today I saw a true move on U.F.O.'s and I saw films of sightings. They said that they do exist. I want your true opinion on what, that area. The ones I saw had a blueish-green light and they seemed to be staying near the towers which are near my house.

Another thing I would like to know is if you have any idea where they come from. I have tried to find that out but the only logical place is "Mars". I have found out that Mars has a thin atmosphere.

I would like all the information on U.F.O. as possible.

THANK YOU
