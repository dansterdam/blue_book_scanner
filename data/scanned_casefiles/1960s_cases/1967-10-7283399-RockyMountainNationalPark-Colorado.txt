5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: a few seconds

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

7. COURSE: South

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer saw an extremely bright white light in the western sky. The light traveled in a southerly direction and was invisible for several seconds till it disappeared below the horizon. No noise was heard at any time.

COMMENTS: The description of the object is similar to that of an aircraft with its landing lights on, even though no noise was heard. The observer was sent a 164 to complete such information as the time of the sighting and also to get general information. Because this additional information was never submitted to us the case is being evaluated as INSUFFICIENT DATA.

11 October 67

Dear Mr [redacted]:

This will reply to your letter of October 24, to the Secretary of Defense, with respect to your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, it is impossible, at this time, to offer an explanation as to what you saw. If you will complete the attached questionnaire and send it in the inclosed postage-free envelope to the address given on it, we will endeavor to determine for you what it was that you actually observed.

In the future, should you sight another UFO, please report it immediately to the UFO investigator at the nearest Air Force base. An immediate on-the-spot investigation is normally more productive than one conducted a long time after the occurrence. The important details may have become hazy in the viewer's mind.

We hope that the inclosed material will be of interest in your further understanding of these objects. Thank you for your interest in our UFO program.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. MILES
Major, USAF
Acting Chief, Civil Branch

Denver, Colorado
October 14, 1967

Secretary of Defense
Washington, D.C.

Subject: UFO

Dear Sir:

So little did I ever expect to observe any phenomenon that might remotely fall under the classification of Unidentified Flying Objects that I never retained in my mind the serious of the U.S. Air Force officer to whom we were requested to submit such descriptions. I would therefore appreciate your office forwarding this letter to the interested authorities.

The place of sighting was from a hillside off a bit from the Aspenglen Campground, a stretch of the road from the Hell River Entrance of the Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. It was around midnight on Wednesday, October 11th.

Darkness fell earlier than I had expected, and I was already tucked into my tent by seven o'clock, supine, with only my head in the open to view the skies with as little discomfort from the cold as possible. Parts of the sky were covered by central-moving streaky clouds, so my first glimpse of the half moon was initially with the crescent of the mountain twin peaks to the south of my campsite. With the clouds diffusing the moonlight, the sky never did get as black as I had been led to expect from planetarium lectures. Even when the moon was cloud hidden, the sky never was black. This it was rather long. Then I expected before the first star became visible. It appeared directly overhead, rather dim, and not another star could be seen anywhere in the entire sky. A little later, a second star, brighter than the first, showed through the boughs of the tree to which the other end of my tent was secured. Then, shortly after, a sprinkling of stars became visible from horizon to horizon between the clouds. The ones overhead seemed very bright, and I turned after a while to study the ones toward my right.

Though this experience of sundown and moonrise and being alone "roughing it" on a mountain for the first time was thrilling, I had to admit to myself that I had been able to see millions of more stars a thousand times brighter in North Reading, Massachusetts, and even, in terms of a strange, this demonstration was rather a flop.

As I watched one of the few stars, dimly visible in the western part of the sky, suddenly appeared some distance directly "beneath" it - at about half way between the dim star I was viewing, and the mountain-rim horizon. In an instant it became the brightest star in the entire sky, and then to my surprise it began moving toward the left (southerly) in incredible white brilliance. At first I thought I am a misguided star, but as a star, I realized it couldn't possibly be a plane, for I have watched thousands of airplanes and jets streak across the skies at night - from as close as from within airfields for take-off and landings to as far away as when they just become visible stars in the sky - and none ever produced such powerful brilliant of its kind white.

ights as the light I was looking at - and when plane li. is are brightest to the eye, the engine sound is deafening. No sound at all was heard during the passage of the light I viewed. Besides, this was a "sphere" of incandescence - there was no front or no back nor top or bottom - it was total illumination - and there were no red and green lights visible as are customary on aircraft at night - and from its direction of movement, I would have been able to see the blinking colored lights if it had been a plane, but none existed. It was as though I were watching a star with brilliance at least ten times that of any star of the first magnitude - but it was moving on an absolute straight line parallel to the horizon. Its track were as though one was put a T-square across that piece of sky - end I realized watching it move in such an artificially straight line this: the track of my craft I over saw in the sky always had some degree of slope to the eye, even when traveling "straight as the crow flies." I was still marveling at the unnatural passage of the moving object when it disappeared behind a cloud - nor was its powerful light ever reflected from the cloud banks - nor did I see its light again through any break in the clouds or the object emerge in the extrapolated course of its track beyond the clouds. It simply disappeared completely. After it seemed certain that it would not reappear in my view, I looked at my watch by flashlight and noted it was 7:55 pm.

And I must admit everything I was experiencing as a city person camping for the first time in the Rockies was so far and nervously, all exhilarating such a uniquely poetic experience that when I viewed the passage of that object through the sky, I simply frowned a bit and thought "That's odd" and added it to the mind's album of the unique and novel - an esoteric collection that one goes over at leisure later - an not so limited to "concerned with survival" or a cold windy hillside and hiking several miles for the first time with a backpack and food supplies.

Yet I could not help wondering - why did I not spotted the object moving from the right to left just before its appearance under the dim star, which at that time was to bright, in the area, when the object did first catch my eye, it was directly underneath the star I was viewing, and increased in a millisecond from the almost to the brightest light in the heavens - much more brilliant than the moon - an amazing instantaneous phenomenon. Yet I am prone to think it a "stationary" star before it proceeded on the straight-line track I described - with no change in that straight-line passage in the intensity of its incandescence - nor was there any "trailing" phenomena. It seemed to me as it were a star distance away - yet even if it were as close as the brightest star I had ever seen, just closer than any jet I had seen - and I had during that day seen jet streams move across the skies over the mountains - and could hear the jets - yet they did not covered the area as the fast or very slow "unnatural" straight line.

I am careful as to the exact length of time that passed from my first perception of its emerging dimness to the disappearance of the brilliant object behind the cloud - it was a matter of a few seconds -

I apologize for not breaking camp and return, to town immediately the next morning, a diary, this information to you - but it is only now I am writing, returned to Denver and recovered from the fatigue of hiking that I could apply my mind fully to the significance of the various events.

If this observation merits your attention, and I now believe it does, a more scientific query, on of the location of my sighting could probably be given to you by a group of young men that went hiking and rock tapping through the area the next day. We exchanged greetings as they passed, and they could tell by my notice the green plastic "hunk." They carried and departed in a cream-colored station wagon with a license plate marked "Property of Colorado."

I do not remember the license number, but undoubtedly one of the rangers at Water Park Nature City could identify it.

Like many another citizen, I hope I was viewing some unique and advanced research instrument of our own scientific genius, and if so, it is probably of scientific interest for the developers to learn how even an average citizen can identify its appearance as an extraordinary phenomenon as it moves across the sky.

Needless to say, I am not about to advertise this experience elsewhere, and at this point in my life, it is the last thing I would desire making to report to the United States Government. Nevertheless, in conscience I feel it my duty to inform you of the event.

Sincerely yours,

age: 43 years (November 15, 1962)
Eyes: 20/40 (but I was wearing my glasses at the time)
