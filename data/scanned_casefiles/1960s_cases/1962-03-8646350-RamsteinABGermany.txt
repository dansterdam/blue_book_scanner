The image does not contain any photographs, only a PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD. I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

1. DATE: 25 March 62
2. LOCATION: Ramstein AB Germany
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 231735Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: (1) Visual and (2) Ground-Radar
5. PHOTOS: Yes
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-5 minutes
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
8. COURSE: Straight and level
9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Pilot of F-86D observing clear evening sky, observed a bright object which appeared to be pulsing or flashing at regular intervals. The object was also observed on Ground Control Intercept radar. Pilot was unable to overtake or intercept the object. It disappeared from both visual and radar observation.
10. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Unknown. (2) Unidentified flying object, possibly Balloon or Meteor.
11. COMMENTS: Although the pilot and radar description appears to be adequate to allow identification, the reported performance exceeds capabilities of any known vehicles or phenomena. His description is consistent with previous reports, however there are no satisfactory conventional explanations for this type of sighting. The reported maneuvers and disappearance under surveillance indicate the object was under intelligent control. No further data for evaluation.
