UFO Observation, 9 May 1967

Match Supervisor
FAA Control Tower
Memphis Municipal Airport
Memphis, Tennessee 38101

1. Our office is in receipt of several reports of unidentified flying objects over the Memphis area, particularly on 9 May 1967, at approximately 2215 hours.

2. Request information on activity of any aircraft engaged in aerial advertising in the Memphis, Tennessee area. Reports consist of blinking lights that descended, ascended, circled, and hovered over Memphis. Possibly your May records, if not destroyed, would indicate if such an aircraft was airborne over Memphis on the night of 9 May 1967. If the owner's name and address are known by your office, this information would be most helpful in our evaluation.

EVENING, DURING SIMILAR WEATHER CONDITIONS, FURTHER THIS IS THE
SECOND REPORT OF SIGHTING IN THE SAME AREA OF AN OBJECT OF PECULIAR
SHAPE, BEHAVIOR AND DIMENSIONS WHICH TENDED TO FRIGHTEN, CONFUSE, OR
BEWILDER OBSERVERS. BOTH OBSERVERS WERE ADAMANT IN STATING THE

OBJECT WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT OR A HELICOPTER. THE OLDER OF THE TWO
STATED THAT SHE WAS BLINDED BY THE LIGHT TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE

OBSERVERS SEEMED COMPLETELY RELIABLE INDICATE OBSERVERS MAY HAVE
SIGHTED A PHENOMENON OF SOME SORT. MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE IS NOT KNOWN
TO BE AN AREA OF ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA; THEREFORE, THIS POSSIBILITY IS
RULED OUT. THE MEMPHIS COTTON CARNIVAL CURRENTLY IS IN PROGRESS

CAUSE OF THIS SIGHTING CAN BE DRAWN. PARA 11 (LMA): NONE.
