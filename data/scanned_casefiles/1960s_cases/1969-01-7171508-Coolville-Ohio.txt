    The observer watched a star-like light in the big dipper for at least an hour. It then moved to the top of the sky-- and just faded away as though going straight up.

    COMMENTS: The observer has seen numerous other UFOs in the past. It is his belief that the observer is unable to easily recognize such stimulus as stars, satellites, aircraft, meteors, etc and for this reason the sighting is being carried as Unreliable Report.

Allegra Cunningham Jr.,

I take this picture (negative) of the 21 Jan 69 at
night while up at mother and dad's place. I was
troubled. Perhaps you have some proof of
reality. Out of the dark in not of the
light, I decided here are two or three of these
"stars" that just went past. It was telling the truth
when telling the path. When I went
saw one the March 9th with 100% I now see
several more that not close up like on March
9th.

The 21-26 on the picture was taken around
1:10 m to 2:10 m in the morning only at altitude,
Chillicothe City, miles in flying a deep) as I remember
in re height miles sight. It looked like
some high altitude. At height I was at
appears after at height got hope then probably
the start of the day when I look the picture
of started. It is light of and my aerial
view, you just pulled away as though you
think the "stars" ground.

One job several of these "stars" ground
height, location of latitude more and first
time was 21 of Jan 1969. They look
strange to be height steps will step
at top more again when more again lifted
up after more again, hearing these lights
will find out.

I saw a big ball after. I hope a
most of the time with not to make that
in 170. But the pole going to make it
of the window just to find it we it come
down and land too the point about the branch.
I'll have to do something still not to see it
the more we it will then have to distinguish
