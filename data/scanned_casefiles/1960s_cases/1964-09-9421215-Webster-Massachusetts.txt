THIS SAME OBJECT AT THE SAME LOCATION ON 27 AUGUST 1964 BY WAS
CIESA, OF 7/14 SCHOOL ST, WEBSTER, MASS AT 15032 WITH NEGATIVE IN-
VESTIGATIVE RESULTS. THIS WAS REPORTED BY ME TO VISIT MODDY, FID
TDE W/RADAR-PATTERSON AFB ON 2 SEPTEMBER. THE ONLY DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE SIGHTINGS WAS THAT ON 27 AUGUST, THE OBJECT DISAP-
PEARED RAPIDLY TO THE WEST AND RETURNED TO SAME AREA ALTITUDE FOR
APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR. IN BOTH CASES THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED
TO BE AT VERY HIGH ALTITUDE. THE RAPID MOVEMENT WOULD SEEM TO RULE
OUT A BALLOON. ANY FURTHER SIGHTINGS OF THIS OBJECT WILL BE INVESTI-
GATED BY THE SAME METHODS AND THE RESULTS EXPEDITIOUSLY FORWARDED.
