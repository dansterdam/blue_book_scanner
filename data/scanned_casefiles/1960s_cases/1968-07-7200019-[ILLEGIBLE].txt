Dear Sirs:

At 9:38 PM on 6 July 1968, a light was observed by two persons on the Atlantic Ocean about 15 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. It appeared to be at about 40-45 degrees elevation and moved in an erratic pattern for several minutes before disappearing. The light was described as pulsing and changing colors from bright white to red to green. At times the light seemed to hover, at other times it moved rapidly in various directions.

This aerial phenomenon was witnessed by two reliable and responsible persons who are not given to imagining things. They are certain the light was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or any other known object. Both persons were very impressed and somewhat frightened by what they saw.

We would appreciate your evaluation of this incident and any information you might have on similar occurrences in this general area. We are most anxious to determine the nature of this sighting and would be grateful for any assistance you could provide.

Sincerely yours,
[Illegible signature]

Here is the text from the document:

My report and I were at an angle of 9:35pm on August 5, 1968. I saw a bright light among the trees and moved close to investigate. I stopped the car and looked up to see a circular object about 40-50 feet across hovering silently just above the tree tops. It was glowing with a bright bluish-white light and seemed to be made of metallic material. After a minute or two, the object slowly moved off to the west and disappeared.

Text from the document:

I should not have any heavy or any other the 
heavens and did not seem to move. It made no nois
night, and remained so without motion for several
minutes. It just seemed to hang the about stationary 
once or twice it gave a little tremor, as though being 
acted upon by some force or motion. I have not ha
any previous experience such as this, and I am rath
bewildered by it. However I do not have any hearin
or visual defects, and am quite sure of what I saw. I
do not know how to interpret this incident, but it wa
certainly quite strange and I never have seen anythin
like it before. I cannot offer any explanation of what 
was

- Strange Lights 
Not Invaders

"Are you sure we're not being invaded?"
That was the question asked many times as telephone calls were made to the police and news media last night. 

The calls were prompted by strange lights in the sky over Dayton. The lights were seen as far west as Brookville, west of here.

Now, a flying object, believed to be a light plane, has been sighted over the city, according to Dayton police.

JULY 8-
Solar Flare Sparks 
Lights, Jams Radio
Large flaring solar storm accompanied by magnetic storms and auroral displays late last night and today. Authorities on the sun's activity believe a major flare erupted from the sun's surface beginning at 10:30 pm GMT July 7. This flare, one of the biggest of the current 11-year cycle, produced brilliant displays of the northern lights in Alaska, Canada, and western states. Radio signals in the higher frequencies were seriously jammed or blacked out over a wide area.
GEORGETOWN, S.C. (UPI)
This strikingly bright flare was observed at 10:30 pm July 7. It continued for over 6 hours, with the maximum effect on radio communications noted at 2 am - 4 am this morning. Widespread power failures were reported, and many persons were awakened by the bright auroral displays.

CRAFT REPORT 7/16/68

THAT NIGHT I SAW A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY THAT HOVERED OVER OUR HOME FOR QUITE SOME TIME.  IT WAS FIRST SEEN AT ABOUT 10:45 PM AND REMAINED THERE FOR NEARLY 15 MINUTES. THERE WERE NO BLINKING LIGHTS, JUST A VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO BE SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR. IT FINALLY STARTED TO MOVE AWAY FROM US VERY SLOWLY AND SILENTLY, UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE AND IT HAS LEFT ME QUITE SHAKEN. I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE IN THE AREA REPORTED A SIMILAR SIGHTING THAT EVENING.

DIVISION GUARDIANS SAID UFO WAS 7-8 YARDS LONG. THIS IS POSSIBLE TO REALLY BE SMALL AS US RADAR SITES IN AREA TO SOUTH WERE ALERTED, AND AT 2700152A AIRCRAFT SIZED LIGHT WAS SEEN AT RADAR SITE AT WADENA AFS, MOVING SOUTH. AT 27/2352A A RED STAR SIZED LIGHT WAS MADE A KWIT RADAR UNCLAS  
SEEN BY PERSONNEL AT OSCOLA AFS, MOVING SOUTH EAST. NO RADAR CONTACT WAS MADE. THOUGH SEVERAL SITES TRIED TO SPOTLIGHT IT WITH HEIGHT FINDERS, THE US SIGHTINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN AIRCRAFT, AS THE PERSONNEL WERE EXPECTING TO SEE SOMETHING. IF IT WAS THE SAME OBJECT IT WAS HEADING ABOUT 160 AT 300 KNOTS FROM SIOUX LOOKOUT TO WADENA, THEN TURNED LEFT TO ABOUT 120 HEADING AND SLOWED TO 120 KNOTS TO OSCOLA. IT LOOKED MUCH LIKE SIMILAR UFOS REPORTED IN THIS AREA DURING LAST WEEK OR TWO. 
IT SEEMS TO BE COMING FROM A REMOTE AREA WEST OF HUDSON'S BAY. MANY UFOS REPORTED TO THIS OFFICE IN LAST TWO YEARS HAVE COME OUT OF THE AREA OR HEADED INTO IT.

IN PHYSICAL EVIDENCE - NONE.

Dear Hector:

I enclose herewith a xerox of a report that I think was published about July 7, 1968, relative to some spectacular sightings in the Seattle area. Have you any more information on this sighting?

Many thanks.

The image contains a newspaper clipping or document titled "19 Lights Soon, Fire Rockets In Seattle Area, Pilot Claims". There is no photograph or image present in this document, only text.

19 Lights Soon, Fire Rockets 
In Seattle Area, Pilot Claims

A local pilot said he saw 19 lights "soon" in a row over the area and they then fired rockets. He said the lights paced his plane for a while. He told officials he couldn't be convinced that they were not some kind of aircraft. A group of local residents also reported seeing the lights and flashes.

Balloons or Not? Unidentified Views Very
TO OFFICIALS
The Military and many civilians were surprised, alarmed, and somewhat mystified by certain unidentified aerial phenomena witnessed Sunday night, July 7, 1968. Aviation officials at Ground Control in Gander, Newfoundland, received numerous reports of strange lights and objects in the sky from pilots, tower personnel, and others. Sergeant Edward A. Rowe, Control Tower Operator in Gander, informed the headquarters of the North American Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs, CO, of these observations.
PILOT RUDY MALASSINNA described formation of lights which he observed sometime around 11:30 p.m. local time. According to his report, he was flying a Trans-Canada Airlines flight from Toronto to Deer Lake, Newfoundland, when he noticed a formation of lights below him which seemed to be hovering about 500 feet above the ground. He called the attention of the co-pilot and engineer to the strange phenomena. The lights were described as white, red, green and blue, arranged in a triangular formation, with the blue light at the apex. The formation was observed for about 15 minutes. As he approached nearer, the lights either disappeared or scattered in various directions.
THIS BALLOON theory is inadequate to explain the foregoing description of the phenomena by a competent airline pilot. Balloons couldn't fly in formation or change directions as described. The objects were under intelligent control.

Hector:
Reports on the second day of his report on the UFO Invasion of Seattle on July 7, 1947. A person sent me the original newspaper clipping of which I suppose he made this report.

The first-day story he sent is in the form of a poor report, which is typical of how the D.C. newspapers has reported this thing. I suppose if I had been a paper publisher, I would have sent you a cartoon. 

This is a classic case of how reported the UFOs exhibited a strong maneuverability, moved very way when he turned on his searchlighti. disappeared suddenly, slowed down considerably from great speed to 175 miles per hour, and eluded his attempts to it by 175 miles.

Eerie Red Lights Elude Chase By Plane Here
(From Page 1)
A 4,000-foot jetliner approached the Paine Field landing pat-about 6:30 a.m. this morning and the pilot could hardly receive the control-tower contacts.
"Then the center handed us the Seattle tower to contact," he said. "The lights appeared to be 10 miles ahead."
He said that "the lights appeared to be from 6,000 to 10,000 feet above the ground - and they were not fixed. They seemed to be moving in circles and moving up and down."
"The pilot said, "When I turned directly in front of the light to make a tight circle turn, the lights appeared to be a solid formation, and I turned away again."
"These lights made a jerky, sideways type of movement as if they were swinging," he said.
"Just two seconds later, I looked over my shoulder and saw that the main body appear to split and go back together in a formation like a perfect triangle."
"Well, four lights were red, and they were changing from deep red to bright red and they were not flashing. They were solid, and they were not being picked up by our radar," he said and he told the Seattle tower of the sighting.
"WHERE'S a military formation dropping rockets or a few flares and they had no visible trail and formation is the greatest mystery. 
These lights were not plane red and not blinking - I don't know what they were."

THE VOICE OF THE NORTHWEST

"It's the kind of thing that just isn't supposed to happen. The crew said the turrets got a "light" on and they figured it wasn't an ordinary plane."

"BESIDES THE FAA, the Coast Guard, Air Force and the intelligence section of the FBI are all trying to unravel the mystery. They've been asking locals about any unusual sightings or landings around the time the incident occurred."

"WHAT WERE EMPHATICALLY within the vision of the crew, however, were two unidentified flying objects, elongated in shape and brilliant in color, one of which was reported to have disappeared 'right in front of our eyes.'"

JULY METEORS

The crescent moon in the evening sky will not hamper observing when the Delta Aquarid meteor shower is most active. This occurs on July 29th, when about a dozen shower members may be seen hourly, but some activity takes place for a couple of weeks before and after the predicted peak. At maximum, the radiant lies at right ascension 22h 36m, declination -16°, it moves eastward about 1° a day.
