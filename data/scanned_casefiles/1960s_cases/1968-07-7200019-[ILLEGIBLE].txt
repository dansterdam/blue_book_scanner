PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. TIME GROUP: [Illegible]

2. LOCATION: [Illegible]

10. CONCLUSION: Pass. Aircraft

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 seconds

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground visual

7. COURSE: N to NW

8. PHOTOS: Yes ☒ No ☐

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Yes ☐ No ☒

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The Observer sighted a moving, pulsating white light, the light was visible for thirty seconds and seemed to move in a zig-zag motion.

COMMENTS: The observation is of a point source white light. The site still may have been any number of things, an airplane landing or departing from Andover municipal airport, a satellite, a game-bag hot air balloon or even a weather balloon. Since blinking or steady lights observed at night do not constitute a valid UFO report, the sighting is being carried as other (point source of light).

Most of the text on this page is upside down or sideways and partially illegible. However, I can make out the following text:

Top of page (upside down):
"PAGE 6 OF 9 PAGES"

Bottom of the page (upside down):
"APR 68-08-14(13)"

The page contains three diagrams:
1. A small circular diagram on the top left
2. A larger circular diagram on the top right, which appears to be a map or geographical representation
3. A circular diagram at the bottom center with directional markings (N, S, E, W) and other abbreviations like MSM, MNN, etc.

The text in the margins and between diagrams is mostly illegible due to the orientation and image quality.

Dear Sir;

My wife and I were in our back yard at 9:38 pm on August 7, 1968, shortly for the span of the Echo Satellite which was due to pass 9:35 pm in the Western Horizon traveling South at 32° (degrees to be correct)

I had in my possession a pair of binoculars. I saw an airplane in the Southern horizon and planned to look at it, easily had five more minutes before with satellite appeared.

While scanning this place I saw/say one natural object I first thought to be a star then it got brighter and moved in and easterly direction, slowly at first, and seemed to triple etc appear. It moved faster than the Echo Satellite which I saw later and seemed to be off the fifth minute. It traveled a straight line about few seconds span. The object got about our 15 angle.

Dear Sir;

My wife and I were on back yard
at 9:30 pm on August 8, 1965 watching for the appear-
ance of the Echo Satellite which was due to pass
9:39 pm in the western horizon traveling north
South at 30° Elegree to be accurate.

I had an easy possession a few of my
binoculars I saw an object in the sky the
horizon and decided to look at it. My wife
had five more minutes before the satellite
appeared.

While viewing this plan I single object
noticed what I first thought to be a satel-
lites it got brighter and more distinct,
slowly, distinctly, slowly at first, and then
seemed to triple its speed. It moved more
faster than the Echo Satellite. I was
later and viewed to be of the type of
minute. It traveled on a straight line
about four seconds and then slid up
about an inch on the sky.

PLANE FLYING OVER CITY OF DAYTON MONDAY NIGHT
Cast Eerie Beam of Light—Staff Photo by Charles Sievert

PLANE CAUSES CALLS
Strange Lights
Not Invaders

"Are you sure we're not being invaded?"
That was the first question of one telephone caller as speculation ran high Monday night for the weird aerial display over Dayton and neighboring East Dayton, base and the Huber Heights area.

POLICE agencies after checking with Wright-Patterson AFB, the base and the police still continued answering calls.

Postal Windows
Close Saturday

OXFORD—Oxford post office will be closed Saturday morning for annual spring cleaning, Postmaster Charles Haines announced.

The staff estimated about 200 calls were received.

In Kettering area, some residents and groundhogs yet fell victim to a deep, dark mystery light which seemed to come from yards to watch people in front yards.

FROM A distance the light appeared as a bright beam. Engineers in the plane said the aircraft was flying at about 5,000 feet while the plane circled, and the pilot was unaware of the effect.

The headline suggests a partial headline "SCHIZO MA" and "DRIVER, ST" but these are not complete and appear to be cut off.

Solar Flare Spawns
Lights, Jams Radio

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) - of a third large-grade
(AP) - A solar flare radio blackout Wednesday, when the
erupted Wednesday, jam- first of five that was expected.
ming radio communica- 
tions and creating north- 
ern lights as far south as 
Colorado, the National 
Center for Atmospheric 
Research said.

Forecaster Karl Kidder 
of the U.S. Space Disturbance 
Forecast center said there is 
a good chance of similar 
phenomena Wednesday night 
or Thursday as a result of an-
other major sunspot region.

Also, he said, data analysis 
shows a 24-hour period of 
radio blackout like this one 
may occur again this week.

The Space Blackout 
Tuesday was less troublesome 
than the initial magnetic 
storm immediately after the 
flare was recorded at 1:02 
p.m. EDT Monday.

Dear [redacted]

This will reply to your undated letter, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting you are looking at in the categories of objects often reported as UFOs in the Project Blue Book report we are enclosing.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir

last night 7/1/68
saw a yellow circ(ular) object
at an elevation
of 90° it could not
see any shape. the
stars were but the moon
was out & the seeing
was fair. it spanned
more than 5' so
it could not be a star
it was of a different
magnitude than Venus
it faded slowly & vanished
in the 2 minute of
observation. I have never
not bright or lighter my
vicinity.

Note: Some words are partially illegible or cut off, so I've used best judgment in interpreting them. The text appears to be a handwritten report of a UFO sighting on July 1, 1968.

9 Lights Soar, Fire Rockets
In Seattle Area, Pilot Claims

SEATTLE — Nine red lights soared back and forth above Seattle for more than 40 minutes Sunday night, residents said, and one private pilot who chased them said they definitely were aircraft.

The source of callers swamped civilian and military telephones in the Puget Sound region. The glittering objects ran counterclockwise.

Observers said they were clearly visible from the Ground, but the Center for Aerial Disc Research and local and military aircraft towers could not spot them on radar.

"The last one didn't just fade out, but just plain disappeared," said pilot Rudy Blasband. "I was flying at about 6,000 feet below it and it simply accelerated."

Blasband, a real estate salesman, was flying at 6,000 feet. He was directed by the Airway Flight Control to an area about 40 miles from the field.

A few seconds later, he was able to pick up a guide from the Seattle-Tacoma Field.

Balloons... or Not?
UFO Views Vary

To official eyes, the blue flirty spheres which mystified thousands of Seattleites Sunday night were balloons with flares attached — apparently sort of a prank by pranksters.

That explanation has been accepted by Seattle police, the National AFB officials, the Defense Department administration, and observers at Boeing Field control tower, who saw the lighted objects.

ONE is a Des Moines pilot who said he chased the Unidentified Flying Objects for 45 minutes, and the leader of a local UFO-observing organization.

THE BALLOON theory is based onchard evidence picked up by two officers patrolling near the intersection of Rainier Avenue and Curless Avenue N.

They said residents of the area reported seeing the flying formations by 300 the interesting Officer G.

ONE MAN who doesn't agree is Rudy Malaspina, who chased the UFOs in his light private plane. He said:

"Balloons couldn't fly in formation like that, and they certainly couldn't change directions and accelerate so quickly."

By using such references as reference points, the Des Moines pilot estimated the red objects traveled faster than 1,600 miles an hour. He said the first appeared from eight-inch in diameter. By watching off him lights could Malaspina said he was able to change to nearly three times their original size.

WHEN I had to turn the lights on again, they apparently flew away because they got small again.

Malaspina, who concluded the objects near Pier 91 on a flight from Friday Harbor, described them as "metallic."

Officials at McChord Air Force Base said in 100% certainty that the objects were balloons released from the Boeing Company.

The document also includes two diagrams:
1. A diagram showing two formations of UFO flight paths
2. A sketch showing the path of the UFOs as described by Rudy Malaspina

Hector:

For our baloon, here is the 2nd day report on the UFO Invasion of South in July 7th. A Xerox sent me the original newspaper clipping of this July 9 story, so you may keep this Xerox.

The first-day story he sent in the form of a poor Xerox, which I rushed out to Bob Loc at Colorado. Meanwhile I've noted newspaper to send him a Xerox-shoot copy of its first July 8 story.
If I got it, will send you a Xerox.

This is a classic case-in which pilot reported the UFOs exhibited "intelligent control, moved away when he turned on his running lights"; "they" seemingly stopped his cockpit clock at 1035 p.m., and caused his compass to be in error by 170 deg.

Eerie Red Lights Elude Chase By Plane Here
(From Page 1)

[The rest of the text continues, but some parts are partially cut off or difficult to read completely. I'll transcribe what I can clearly make out:]

"I could hardly receive the tower's instructions. Then the tower handed me to Boeing Tower by radio transfer and I made a vertical climb of a nine vertical lights "WE WERE closing fast directly in front of it. This is a military aircraft," and I turned instantly. These nine lights made a night collision turn instantly. You're not surprised to turn violently from the tower, but I turned.

"Well, four objects were red from these objects, and they were not flares. They were red dots. Three of them at triangular Green Lake I sat on the phone and told the Boeing Field tower...

JULY METEORS

The crescent moon in the evening sky will not hamper observing when the Delta Aquarid meteor shower is most active. This occurs on July 29th, when about a dozen shower members may be seen hourly, but some activity takes place for a couple of weeks before and after the predicted peak. At maximum, the radiant lies at right ascension 22h 36m, declination --17°; it moves eastward about 1° a day.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JULY 8-14, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar Height Chart, and the Higher and Lower Temperature Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map.

An explanation sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to: Communication Services Administration, Publication Section, PD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also be ordered at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents the station data and the analyses for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by chains of arrows; the locations of these centers at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. on the preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, on which the analyses are based. Occasionally, different discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from these station records that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms of the 500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are drawn at 5°C intervals.

[Main Text Block]
The Surface Weather Map presents station data and analysis for 7:00 a.m., e.g. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by chains of arrows; the locations of these centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are noted by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the final analysis can result from those station reports that may be included because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms of the 500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. eastern. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500 millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature and Minimum Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum temperatures for the 24 hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. for various points. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches at 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

The charts in this publication are a
continuation of the principal charts
of the Weather Bureau published
Daily Weather Map. They include the
Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar
Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation
Chart. All of the charts for one day are
arranged on a single page of this publication.

The Surface Weather Map presents
station data and the analysis for 7:00
a.m./e.s.t. The tracks of well defined
low pressure areas are indicated by
chains of arrows; the locations of these
centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours
preceding map time are indicated by
small black squares enclosing white
crosses. Areas of precipitation are
indicated by shading. The weather
reports that are printed here are only
a fraction of those that are included in
the operational weather maps, and on
which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between
the printed station data and the analyses
result from those station reports that
cannot be included in the published
maps because of lack of space.

They are cooperatively prepared by the
National Meteorological Center, Weather
Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The symbols used on the
Surface Weather Map and the 500Millibar Chart are those used previously in Daily Weather Maps. Single copies may be obtained without
charge by writing to: Environmental

Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also
be ordered at a cost of $2.30 per 50
copies. Checks should be made payable
to the Superintendent of Documents.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the
height contours and isotherm of the
500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t.
The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labelled in feet
above sea level. The isotherm are

shown as dashed lines, and are
in degrees Celsius. The wind
line and direction and speed
500 millibar level.

The Precipitation and Lowest T
tures Chart presents the ma
and minimum values for 24-h
period ending at 7:00 a.m./e.s
names of the recording stations
contained from the Surface W
Map. The maximum temperatu
