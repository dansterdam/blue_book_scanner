6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION    11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Visual                    A bright, metallic-colored object came out of the north and came straight down and got larger as it got closer. Appeared to be disk-shaped and the size of a jet. The object hovered and then made a 90 degree turn and flew off to the northwest. On one occasion the witness saw a faint red light around the object. The air base has received such reports but could not identify the object. According to the witness, an aircraft took off from the nearby Lambert airport at 1355 hrs and the object seemed to be attracted to the aircraft. The air base could not identify the object.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: 375 (OP) (Mr McPherson/3612)

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting

TO: FTD (TDETR)

1. Forwarded for action by your headquarters in accordance with paragraph 7a, AFR 80-17.

2. This report was thoroughly investigated and determined to be an Ozark Airlines Convair ADLER 580 flight descending Lambert Municipal Airport on an IFR approach. The aircraft was identified as such and flew directly towards Mrs. McPherson's location. This constitutes supporting data for the contention that the only the same caused a report of this sighting.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn illustration or diagram rather than a photograph. The illustration depicts a central point or origin with numerous radiating lines or beams extending outward in various directions.

The text below the illustration discusses the straightforward course and motion of some object, described as not blinding or flashing. It mentions the object or phenomenon being observed and its unusual nature.

First a straight one coming directly out of 
the south straight towards and about the dustle 
[described as] not blindingly flashing. When it stopped as the
[next section illegible] moment the whole scene was 
lit up brilliantly.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document, likely a report or account of some kind.

The text of the document is as follows:

The rays of light of the object were about as bright as those of a car headlight, though they seemed to be a little more intense. The object was a yellowish-white color with a slight reddish-orange tinge. It appeared to be oval in shape and seemed to be at a very high altitude, perhaps 30,000 to 40,000 feet. It was traveling in a northerly direction at a relatively slow and steady speed, much slower than a jet aircraft. At times, the object seemed to be moving erratically or zigzagging slightly more over than a minute or two, then it would resume its steady northerly course. When it changed direction, the entire object would move in unison, there was no separation or division of the light source. The rays of light seemed to extend the full width of the object, which was estimated to be around 300 to 400 feet in diameter. The rays of light did not seem to illuminate the ground or surrounding clouds. As the object passed overhead, it did not make any sound that could be heard. The observation lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before the object disappeared from view to the north.

Transcribing the text in the document:

I am related by sight of the case and watched through my window the object as it came overhead. Without a doubt the object was not a conventional aircraft and moved with a speed and maneuverability far beyond any plane I have ever seen. The object made no noise and was emitting a strange reddish-orange glow. It hovered a moment and then shot vertically upwards at an incredible speed, far faster than any jet aircraft. I am at a loss to explain what I saw, but I can assure you it was no ordinary aircraft. The object was clearly not of this world. I hope this report will be of some value to your investigation. Please let me know if you require any further information.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

Dear mr. reason:

reason appear to be a definite and of this part of the sighting. he has to go out and get material for the report, otherwise we will not be able to continue with the investigation ..... look at the picture and the attached information. ihere are more details on the sighting. it would be helpful to have some additional information that may assist in a better understanding.

it does not seem to be a definite out-and-out case that would justify going any further. flashing signal in the sky, watching by the people or the local group. it has to go quiet for sometime and see if it can be resolved.

The image contains a hand-drawn illustration depicting a flying saucer in the night sky. The text above the illustration reads "Flying Saucer Doubter Finally Sees the Light - in the Sky" and provides a description of the event that the image is illustrating.

ST. LOUIS GLOBE-DEMOCRAT
31 January 1967

Flying Saucer Doubter Finally Sees the Light - in the Sky
Mrs. Ray Myler, who usually thought reports of UFOs were nonsense, sawa large, white, bright object in the sky shortly after midnight. 
She said it was hovering about a block away. It was larger than a star and quite bright. Mrs. Myler, who is still skeptical, said she had no intention of reporting the object in the sky. Mrs. Myler thinks it was probably a star or some trick of the atmosphere, but says she did see something that night. An officer called the Air Force and the officer was advised that the Air Force had picked up an unidentified object on radar which seemed to be within the area where Mrs. Myler had seen the strange light.
