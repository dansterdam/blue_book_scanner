1. This replies to your recent letter which was undated. We appreciate learning of your unusual experience of 10 July 1967, and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date, it would be impossible to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that a witness report his observation as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base, thus enabling analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation.

Dear Gentlemen,

would like to have your opinion on a very important phenomenon. Since you are a UFO research institution as well I think my letter should be directed to you. I have seen a UFO I am not a UFO fanatic but this is pretty close. I will tell the whole story to you. It was a disc shaped craft about 30 feet in diameter. Its bright was about 00 feet when it was first spotted. Then it came quickly, much lower, almost to the ground. It hovered very rapidly. Its color was bluish green. It was nearly close to me - I'm not about 15 feet from me. After 15 sec of hovering it glided away at about 45 deg. The date was July 10th 1962. The time was at 9:30.

I could go on apply telling more detail
