PART I: FOR ACIN MAJ GEN WASH AND FOR ROY MAJ GEN WATSON

AT 1457 11 APR 51 AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED ON RADAR IN THE VICINITY OF CAPE CANAVERAL PRIOR TO THE LAUNCHING OF TEST NUMBER 1352, A POLARIS MISSILE, SCHEDULED T TIME 1430Z. THREE EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS WATCHED THE TARGET ON AN FPS-8 RADAR FOR 30 MINUTES AND ESTIMATED ITS SPEED AS RANGING BETWEEN 150 AND 600 KNOTS. THESE OBSERVERS REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT ORBITED 6 OR 7 TIMES ALONG AN AZIMUTH OF 120 DEGREES FROM CAPE CANAVERAL AND BETWEEN 10 AND 55 MILES FROM THE CAPE. THE RANGE OBSERVERS' ESTIMATES OF THE HEIGHT OF THE UFO DID NOT AGREE, REPORTING EITHER THAT THE OBJECT WAS VERY LOW OR VERY HIGH. A RANGE SURVEILLANCE C-54 WAS VECTORED TO WITHIN 2½ MILES OF THE OBJECT BUT REPORTS FROM THE CREW WERE NEGATIVE.

THE RANGE C-54 IS EQUIPPED WITH AN APS-42 AND AN APS-59 RADARS BUT UTILIZED ONLY THE APS-42 DURING THIS ATTEMPTED INTERCEPT.

ATIC WPAFB OHIO

CAPT WALTER FLINT, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE TEST, NOTIFIED THE LOCAL GCI SITE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE UFO. HOWEVER, NO INTERCEPT ACTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THE GCI FPS-20 RADAR PICKED UP THE UFO ONLY ONCE EACH THREE SWEEPS OVER AN INTERVAL OF 36 SECONDS AND RECEIVED NO TARGET ON THE HEIGHT FINDER.

PART II. ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE DATA LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TARGET WAS REAL. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE REPORT TO SUGGEST RADAR MALFUNCTION, OR ECHOES, BECAUSE THE TRACKS WERE APPARENTLY WELL DEFINED AND HAD A DEFINITE PATTERN. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS A RELATIVELY SMALL TARGET DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT CONSISTENTLY FIXED AT 44 MILES OUTBOUND IN ITS ORBIT AND REAPPEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 44 MILES INBOUND. THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON FOR THE INABILITY OF THE POWERFUL FPS-20 TO TRACK THE TARGET, UNLESS THE EQUIPMENT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AT THIS TIME OR THE TARGET WAS IN A DEAD AREA FOR THE STATION.

PART III. SINCE NO HEIGHT FINDER DATA WAS OBTAINED CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS MUST BE MADE RELATIVE TO THE TARGET HEIGHT. THE MINIMUM REPORTED RANGE OF THE TARGET WAS 10 MILES. SINCE THIS IS SLANT RANGE AND FURTHER SINCE THE MAXIMUM VERTICAL ANGLE COVERAGE OF THE FPS-20 IS 25-30°, THE MAXIMUM TARGET HEIGHT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 30,000 FEET WHICH OBVIOUSLY RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO BEING AN EXTREMELY HIGH FLYING TARGET. THE PERIODIC HIGH SPEEDS, AS HIGH AS 600 KNOTS, REPORTED FOR THE TARGET, COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THE PPI OF THE FPS-20 WAS NOT OPERATING, FURTHER TENDS TO RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO BEING A VERY LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT.

TARGET. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR WHY
THE FPS-20 HEIGHT FINDER HAS UNABLE TO PAINT THE TARGET.

PART IV. CONTACT WITH LT/COL JAMES O. PAYNE, AFITC, REVEALED
THAT NO NAVY OPERATION COULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIGHTING
AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIMILAR INCIDENTS DURING SUBSEQUENT
TESTS.

PART V. IT IS CONCLUDED BY ATIC THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED ON
RADAR AT CAPE CANAVERAL ON 11 APR 61 AT 14572 WAS PROBABLY A
REAL TARGET, FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF NO MORE THAN 35,000 FEET.
NO DEFINITE EXPLANATION OF WHY THIS TARGET DID NOT APPEAR ON
THE FPS-20 CAN BE REACHED, BUT INSPECTION OF THE SITE AND
THE RADAR MAINTENANCE RECORD WOULD REVEAL IF THIS WAS DUE TO
A DEAD AREA OF FAULTY EQUIPMENT.

AFCIN-4E C-882 FOR GENERAL INFO

THIS MESSAGE IN TWO PARTS. PART I. RECENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL RADAR SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS AT CAPE CANAVERAL DURING THE PREPARATION AND LAUNCHING OF TEST MISSILES.

ON 9 APRIL 1961, AT APPROXIMATELY 2200z, 60 SECONDS BEFORE THE SCHEDULED LAUNCHING OF POLARIS MISSILE TEST # 1352, A FLYING OBJECT WAS OBSERVED ON BOTH THE FPS-8 RADAR AT CAPE CANAVERAL AND THE FPS-20 RADAR AT THE PATRICK AC&W SITE. INTERCEPTION WAS ATTEMPTED BY AN ADC F-102 AND THE INTERCEPTOR LOCKED ON TO THE UNKNOWN TARGET FOR TWO MINUTES. THE UNKNOWN TOOK EVASIVE ACTION AND DISAPPEARED PREVENTING FULL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE INTERCEPT.

PART II. THE POSSIBILITY OF THE NAVY CONDUCTING OPERATION IN THE AREA, EVEN POSSIBLY UNCOORDINATED ASSOCIATION WITH THE TEST, IS WORTH CONSIDERING. REQUEST INFORMATION BE FORWARDED TO ATIC AS TO THE EXTENT OF COORDINATION EXISTING BETWEEN NAVY AND AIR FORCE, BEYOND NORMAL.

UFO was observed on radar, Cape Canaveral, 1457Z, 11 April 61. It was observed for at least 30 minutes. Object appeared to orbit in an orbit which extended from 10 miles from the Cape to a position approximately 55 miles from Cape Canaveral and the orbit was at all times on an azimuth of 125° to 127° SE of Cape Canaveral. According to radar reports the object disappeared when it got 44 miles away from Cape Canaveral appearing on radar and disappearing at the farthest end 6 or 7 miles. Made 6 or 7 long orbits. The object finally disappeared approximately 1530Z in the direction about 125° away from Cape Canaveral.

Radar Operator on an APS-8 radar. He could paint the object very well. The paint size of the object was approximately the same size of a C54 aircraft with no transponder operating. This radar was ______ tracking _______ was good.

Atmospheric conditions were normal. There was no detection of this object on any height finder equipment. Experts opinions differ as to whether this UFO was extremely high or extremely low.

The weather was -- high _______, overcast, visibility 10 miles, wind ENE at 10 knots on the surface. No temperature inversion.

U-2c. PART FIVE. DISCUSSION OF THEORY 1 - U-2 AIRCRAFT. AT APPROX
1700Z, 9 MAY, A TEST WAS RUN BY AFWTC USING A U-2 AIRCRAFT. THIS

AIRCRAFT FLEW OVER CAPE CANAVERAL AT A HEADING OF 120 DEGREES AT
APPROX 65,000 FOOT ALTITUDE AND PROCEEDED 250-270 MILES DOWN RANGE.

WHEN IT APPROACHED THE 250 MILE POINT, A SIF RETURN APPEARED ON THE
FPS-4 RADAR SCOPE BUT NOT ON THE FPS-20. THE P AINT INDICATED A

TARGET AT APPROX 50 MILES FROM THE CAPE. AT THIS POINT, THE CON-
TROLLER AT THE CAPE HAD THE U-2 TURN HIS IFF ON AND OFF. AT EACH

INSTANCE THAT THE IFF WAS TURNED OFF THE PAINT DISAPPEARED FROM THE
FPS-4 SCOPE. EACH TIME THE U-2 TURNED HIS IFF ON, THE PAINT
RETURNED. A CONTINUING COMPARISON OF THE U-2 POSITION PLOTTED BY
THE 2 CAPE RADAR AND THE POSITION OF THE IFF REFLECTION ON THE
RADAR WERE AT ALL TIMES APPROX 220 NAUTICAL MILES APART. PART SIX.

THEORY 2 - TIMING SIGNALS. CONSIDERABLE ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION


- page 17 -

Here is the text from the document:

ARE MADE CONCERNING THE POSSIBILITY OF RANGE TIMING SIGNALS CAUSING
THE UNKNOWN RADAR ANGLES. THERE APPEARS TO BE NO LOGICAL INDI-
CATION TO CONFIRM THIS THEORY, IN THAT BQTMRPS-2 AND FPS-20 RADAR.

PAGE FIVE NJEXQT BOX C
CONFIRMED 2 OF THE 3 UNKNOWN TARGETS, AND DURING 6 LAUNCHES AFTER
27 APRIL NO UNIDENTIFIED RADAR TARGETS WERE DETECTED WITH NO CHANGE
IN TIMING SIGNALS. PART SEVEN. THEORY 3 - FOREIGN OR UNAUTHORIZED
AIRCRAFT. THE THEORY THAT FOREIGN OR UNAUTHORIZED AIRCRAFT WERE
PRESENT ON THE RANGE IS STILL CONCLUDED TO BE PROBABLE. DURING
12 APRIL POLARIS TEST IN 1959 THE U-2 WAS AT A POSITION 410 NM FROM
THE CANAVERAL ON AN AZIMUTH OF 114 DEGREES. THE FPS-20 ACTED THE
TARGET. THE FPS-20 NOTED TT., THE FPS-4 HEIGHT FINDER RECORDED
THE TARGET AT 1,500 FEET ALTITUDE AT 2500* AND AT 6,000 FEET AT
60-62, AND THE PILOT INTERCEPTOR PILOT EMPHATICALLY STATES THAT HIS
ALL-SEEING RADAR LOCKED ON THE TARGET WHICH WAS LATER LOST, THIS
OCCURRENCE WAS DESIGNATED AS TRACK NO. 608 BY THE PATRICK ACAR
SITE COMMANDERS POSITIVELY TO HAVE BEEN A LIVE AIRCRAFT TRACK.
DURING THE JUNO LAUNCH TEST ON 614, 27 APRIL THE U-2 AIRCRAFT WAS
TRACKED. THE FPS-20 AND FPS-2 RADAR CONFIRMED THE TRACK OF THIS
UNKNOWN WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE PATRICK ACAR SITE AS AN UNKNOWN
TRACK NO. 614. THE HEIGHT FINDER FPS-3 DID NOT DETECT THIS UNKNOWN
TARGET. PART EIGHT. CONCLUSION OF THE COMMANDER, PATRICK ACAR

NOTE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS PHENOMENA ACCOUNTS FOR SOME OF THE
UNKNOWN'S SEEN IN THIS AREA AND IS EXPLAINED AS FOLLOWS: THE FPS-
16 (SGP) HAS A 350 PPS AND THE IFF (SIF) HAS A 350 PPS. WHEN AN INTER-
ROGATION IS TRANSMITTED, THE SIGNAL CONTINUES TO 220 MILES, AND AT
THAT POINT THE RECEIVE BLANKS OUT AND A SECOND PULSE IS TRANSMITTED.
MEANWHILE THE FIRST SIGNAL INTERROGATED THE ACT VAT 250 - 470 MILES
AND WILL NOT APPLY BACK. THIS WAS RECEIVED WHEN THE RECEIVE WAS

YET TO RECEIVE THE SECOND INTERROGATION THAT WAS TRANSMITTED. THIS PHENOMENA WOULD THUS CAUSE AN IFF PAINT AT 50 - 70 MILES FROM THE FPS-20 AND COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SECOND GANG PHENOMENA. THE REASON THAT OUR FPS-20 DID NOT EXPERIENCE THIS ACTIVITY WAS BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR RADAR AT 360 PFF, BUT OUR IFF AT 180 PFF. THIS ENABLES OUR IFF RECEIVER TO RECOVER AND NOT ACCEPT A SECOND GANG RETURN.

THUS, THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FPS-20 HAD UNKNOWNS AND THE FPS-20 DID NOT. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED TO AWTO THAT THEY ADJUST THEIR IFF (SIF) TO 180 PFF AND PART OF THE PROBLEM WOULD BE SOLVED.

HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT ANSWER WHY WE PAINTED UNKNOWNS ON BOTH THE FPS-20 AND THE FPS-20 AREAS AS WELL AS THE FPS-20 RADAR. THE FPS-8 CONTROLLER FROM JACKSONVILLE ON 27 APR 61, THE PILOT REPORTED TO THE CAA AND CONFIRMED THAT HE HAD A LOOK ON FOR TWO MINUTES ON A TARGET THAT DISAPPEARED FROM HIS SCOPE. IT THUS APPEARS FROM THE OCCULTA-TIVE STANDPOINT THAT WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS, ONE RESULTING FROM ELECTRONIC PHENOMENA AND THE OTHER AS A RESULT OF ACTUAL UNKNOWNS.

ALTHOUGH THE ADC ACTIVITY WAS KEPT QUIET DURING THIS PERIOD, THE MERE PRESENCE OF ADC WITH ADC MARKINGS COULD CAUSE LACK OF ACTIVITY BY THOSE CAUSING THE UNKNOWNS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT

LINE TO THE JAK AGT SO. PART NINE. CONCLUSIONS OF THE DOS/INTELLI-
GENCE, AFMTC FOLLOW. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT: 1. FIRING SIGNALS HAVE
NOT CAUSED ANY OF THE UNKNOWN RADAR TARGETS. 2. THE IFF BEACON OF
THE U-2 CAUSED THE FPS-20 RADAR TARGET ON 11 APRIL DURING POLARIS TEST
IN 1959. 3. THE UNIDENTIFIED RADAR TARGET ON 19 APRIL DURING POLARIS SUBMARINE LAUNCH TEST NO. 1509 IS CONCLUDED TO HAVE BEEN A
LIVE AIRCRAFT TARGET IN THAT FPS-20, FPS-20, FPS-3, AND F-102 RADAR
CONFIRMED THE TARGET WAS 10 MILES DISTANT, WHICH IS
BELIEVED TO MINIMIZE THE PROBABILITYCE THE TARGET BEING CAUSED BY
THE U-2 IFF. 4. THE RADAR TARGET DETECTED ON 27 APRIL DURING JUNO
LAUNCH TEST NO. 314 COULD POSSIBLY BE A SO CALLED "GROUND ECHO" OF
THE U-2 IFF. 5. THAT THE U-2 WAS 250 MILES DOWNRANGE ON AN AZIMUTH
AND DETECTED AND THE FPS-20 MIGHT PINEAL DID NOT DETECT THE UNKNOWN
TARGET. THIS TARGET COULD ALSO VERY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A LIVE
AIRCRAFT. 6. THAT IT WAS DETECTED BY BOTH THE FPS-20 AND THE FPS6AI
RADAR AND WAS DESIGNATED AS AGC TRACK NO. 641, AND THE FACT THAT THE
UNKNOWN TARGET WAS APPROX 190 MILES FROM THE U-2 INSTEAD OF THE
DEMONSTRATED 250 MILES AND THE FACT THAT THE UNKNOWN TARGET

ON RADAR IN THE VICINITY OF CAPE CANAVERAL PRIOR TO THE
LAUNCHING OF TEST NUMBER 1352, APOLARIS MISSILE, SCHEDULED

CAPT WALTER FLINT, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE TEST, NOTIFIED THE
LOCAL GCI SITE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE UFO. HOWEVER, NO INTERCEPT
ACTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THE GCI FPS-20 RADAR PICKED
UP THE UFO ONLY ONCE EACH THREE SWEEPS OVER AN INTERVAL OF
36 SECONDS AND RECEIVED NO TARGET ON THE HEIGHT FINDER.

PART II. ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE DATA LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT THE TARGET WAS REAL. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE REPORT TO
SUGGEST RADAR MALFUNCTION, OR FALSE ECHOES. BECAUSE THE TRACKS
WERE APPARENTLY WELL DEFINED AND HAD A DEFINITE PATTERN, IT IS
BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS A RELATIVELY SMALL TARGET DUE TO THE
FACT THAT IT CONSISTENTLY FADED AT 44 MILES OUTBOUND IN ITS ORBIT
AND REAPPEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 44 MILES INBOUND. THERE IS NO
LOGICAL REASON FOR THE INABILITY OF THE POWERFUL FPS-20 TO TRACK
THE TARGET, UNLESS THIS EQUIPMENT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AT
THIS TIME OR THE TARGET WAS IN A DEAD AREA FOR THE STATION.

PART III. SINCE NO HEIGHT FINDER DATA WAS OBTAINED CERTAIN
DEDUCTIONS MUST BE MADE RELATIVE TO THE TARGET HEIGHT. THE MINIMUM
REPORTED RANGE OF THE TARGET WAS 19 MILES. SINCE THIS IS SLANT
RANGE AND FURTHER SINCE THE MAXIMUM VERTICAL ANGLE COVERAGE OF THE
FPS-8 IS 25-30 DEGREE THE MAXIMUM TARGET HEIGHT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY

PART I. FOR AFCIN MAJ GEN WALSH AND FOR RDY MAJ GEN WATSON
AT 1457 11 APR 61 AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED
ON RADAR IN THE VICINITY OF CAPE CANAVERAL PRIOR TO THE
LAUNCHING OF TEST NUMBER 1352, POLARIS MISSILE, SCHEDULED
T TIME 1430Z. THREE EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS WATCHED THE TARGET
ON AN FPS-8 RADAR FOR 30 MINUTES AND ESTIMATED ITS SPEED AS
RANGING BETWEEN 150 AND 600 KNOTS. THESE OBSERVERS REPORTED
THAT THE OBJECT ORBITED 6 OR 7 TIMES ALONG AN AZIMUTH OF 126
DEGREES FROM CAPE CANAVERAL AND BETWEEN 10 AND 55 MILES FROM
THE CAPE. THE RANGE OBSERVERS' ESTIMATES OF THE HEIGHT OF THE
UFO DID NOT AGREE, REPORTING EITHER THAT THE OBJECT WAS VERY LOW
OR VERY HIGH. A RANGE SURVEILLANCE C-54 WAS VECTORED TO WITHIN
2 1/2 MILES OF THE OBJECT BUT REPORTS FROM THE CREW WERE NEGATIVE.
THE RANGE C-54 IS EQUIPPED WITH AN APS-42 AND AN APS-59 RADARS
BUT UTILIZED ONLY THE APS-42 DURING THIS ATTEMPTED INTERCEPT.

CAPT WALTER FLINT, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE TEST, NOTIFIED THE
LOCAL GCI SITE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE UFO. HOWEVER, NO INTERCEPT
ACTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THE GCI FPS-20 RADAR PICKED
UP THE UFO ONLY ONCE EACH THREE SWEEPS OVER AN INTERVAL OF
36 SECONDS AND RECEIVED NO TARGET ON THE HEIGHT FINDER.

PART II. ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE DATA LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT THE TARGET WAS REAL. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE REPORT TO
SUGGEST RADAR MALFUNCTION, OR FALSE ECHOES. BECAUSE THE TRACKS
WERE APPARENTLY WELL DEFINED AND HAD A DEFINITE PATTERN, IT IS
BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS A RELATIVELY SMALL TARGET DUE TO THE
FACT THAT IT CONSISTENTLY FADED AT 44 MILES OUTBOUND IN ITS ORBIT
AND REAPPEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 44 MILES INBOUND. THERE IS NO
LOGICAL REASON FOR THE INABILITY OF THE POWERFUL FPS-20 TO TRACK
THE TARGET, UNLESS THIS EQUIPMENT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AT
THIS TIME OR THE TARGET WAS IN A DEAD AREA FOR THE STATION.

PART III. SINCE NO HEIGHT FINDER DATA WAS OBTAINED CERTAIN
DEDUCTIONS MUST BE MADE RELATIVE TO THE TARGET HEIGHT. THE MINIMUM
REPORTED RANGE OF THE TARGET WAS 10 MILES. SINCE THIS IS SLANT
RANGE AND FURTHER SINCE THE MAXIMUM VERTICAL ANGLE COVERAGE OF THE
FPS-8 IS 25-30 DEGREE THE MAXIMUM TARGET HEIGHT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY
30,000 FEET WHICH OBVIOUSLY RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO

UFO WAS VERY LOW LARGELY 210 FT. ALTITUDE. OTHERS BELIEVE UFO WAS AT VERY HIGH ALTITUDE NEARLY MUCH HIGHER THAN NORMAL JET AIRCRAFT. OUR OBSERVER STATED THE ACTION OF THE UFO INDICATED A CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE MISSILE LAUNCH COUNTDOWN IN THAT THE UFO WOULD SETTLE BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE RADAR SCOPE DURING THE PERIODS OF HOLD AND WOULD RETURN WHEN THE COUNT WAS RESUMED. RADAR OBSERVERS STATE THE UFO REMAINED IN A HOVERING POSITION, OR IN AN EXTREMELY TIGHT CIRCLE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS PERIODICALLY. AT OTHER TIMES THE UFO SPEED WAS APPROX THAT OF A C-54 AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS BEING TRACKED ON THE SAME SCREEN. AND AT OTHER TIMES THE UFO SPEED WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF

PAGE FIVE AJEWFQT 590

THE CF-100, APPROXIMATELY 400 KNOTS WHICH WAS BEING TRACKED ON THE SAME RADAR SCREEN AND UPON FINAL DEPARTURE OF THE UFO IT ATTAINED A SPEED ESTIMATED BY THE RADAR OBSERVER TO BE 600 MPH. THE POLARIS LAUNCH AZIMUTH WAS 116 DEGREES WHICH COINCIDES VERY NEAR TO THE AZIMUTH OF THE UFO ORBI NAMELY 125DEGREES. IT IS THE CONSIDERED OPINION OF THE REPORTING OFFICER THAT THIS UFO WAS AN ENEMY AIRCRAFT OF THE U-2 TYPE WHICH WAS OBSERVING POLARIS TEST OPERATIONS WITH A CONTINUING KNOWLEDGE OF THE MISSILE LAUNCH STATUS.

INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED: 1. NEGATIVE.

FOR AFCIN Maj Gen Walsh and For RDY Maj Gen Watson.

At 1457 Z, 11 April 61 an unidentified flying object was sighted on radar in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral. Three experienced observers watched the target on an FPS-8 radar for 30 minutes and estimated its speed as ranging between 150 and 600K.

These observers reported that the object orbited 6 or 7 times along an azimuth of 126 degrees from Cape Canaveral and distances of 10 to 55 miles. The radar observers' estimates of the height of the UFO did not agree, some reporting the object as very low and others that it was extremely high. A range surveillance C-54 was vectored to within 2-1/2 miles of the object but reports from the crew were negative. No other intercept action was accomplished because GCI FPS-20 radar picked up the UFO only momentarily.
