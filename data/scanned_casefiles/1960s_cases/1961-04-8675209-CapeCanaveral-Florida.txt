AT 1457 H 21 APR 61 AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED ON RADAR IN THE VICINITY OF CAPE CANAVERAL PRIOR TO THE LAUNCHING OF THE MERCURY 3 PROJECT, A POLARIS MISSILE, SCHEDULED T TIME 1433Z. THREE EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS WATCHED THE TARGET ON AN FPS-6 RADAR FOR 30 MINUTES AND ESTIMATED ITS SPEED AS RANGING BETWEEN 3,500 AND 4,500 KNOTS. THESE OBSERVERS REPORTED THAT THIS OBJECT PASSED 6 OR 7 TIMES ALONG AN AZIMUTH OF 120 DEGREES FROM CAPE CANAVERAL AND BETWEEN 10 AND 25 MILES FROM THE CAPE. THE RANGE OBSERVERS ESTIMATE OF THE HEIGHT OF THE UFO DID NOT AGREE, REPORTING EITHER THAT THE OBJECT WAS VERY LOW OR VERY HIGH. A RANGE SURVEILLANCE C-54 WAS VECTORED TO WITHIN 25 MILES OF THE OBJECT BUT REPORTS FROM THE CREW WERE NEGATIVE.
THE RANGE C-54 IS EQUIPPED WITH AN APS-42 AND AN APS-59 RADARS BUT UTILIZED ONLY THE APS-42 DURING THIS ATTEMPTED INTERCEPT.

JOINT MESSAGE FORM - CON. STATION SHEET
ATIC WPAFB OHIO
CASE BALANCE FLYING, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS TEST, NOTIFIED THE LOCAL GCI SITE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE UFO. HOWEVER, NO INTERCEPTION ACTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THE GCI FPS-10 RADAR PICKED UP THE UFO ONLY ONCE EACH NINE SECONDS AND RECEIVED NO TARGET ON THE HEIGHT FINDER.
PART II. ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE DATA LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TARGET WAS REAL, SINCE IT EVIDENCED TYPICAL RADAR CHARACTERISTICS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST RADAR MALFUNCTION, OR OTHER CAUSE, BECAUSE THE TRACKS WERE APPARENTLY WELL DEFINED AND HAD A DEFINITE PATTERN. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THIS WAS A RELATIVELY SMALL TARGET, DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR CONTACT AS IT NEARED THE GROUND, AND REAPPEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 44 MILES OUTBOUND. THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON FOR THE INABILITY OF THE FPS-10 TO TRACK TO THE GROUND. SINCE THIS COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE TARGET ALTITUDE, SPEED, OR SOME CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RADAR SET ITSELF WHICH WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO MAINTAIN CONTACT IN A DEAD AREA FOR THE STATION.
PART III. SINCE NO HEIGHT FINDER DATA WAS OBTAINED, DEDUCTIONS LEAD TOWARD INDICATIONS THAT THE ALTITUDE WAS RELATIVELY LOW. THE MINIMUM REPORTED RANGE OF THE TARGET WAS 10 MILES. SINCE THIS IS SLANT RANGE AND PUSHES SINCE THE MAXIMUM VERTICAL ANGLE COVERAGE OF THE FPS-10 IS 20-30 DEGREES, THE MINIMUM ALTITUDE WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 30,000 FEET WHICH OBVIOUSLY RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO BEING AT EXTREMELY HIGH FLYING TARGET. THE PERIODIC HIGH SPEED, AS HIGH AS 600 KNOTS, REPORTED FOR THE TARGET, COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THE IFT OF THE FPS-10 WAS NOT OPERATING, FURTHER TENDS TO RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO BEING A VERY LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT.

TARGET: CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE FPS-20 HEIGHT FINDER WAS UNABLE TO PAINT THE TARGET. BACK LV. (CONTACT WITH LT/COL JAMES 0. PAYNE, ATIC, REVEALED THAT NO SIMILAR OPERATION COULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIGHTING AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIMILAR INCIDENTS DURING SUBSEQUENT TESTS.
PART V. IT IS CONCLUDED BY ATIC THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED ON RADAR AT CAPE CANAVERAL ON 11 APR 61 AT 1457Z WAS PROBABLY A REAL TARGET, FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF NO MORE THAN 35,000 FEET. NO DEFINITE EXPLANATION OF WHY THE TARGET DID NOT APPEAR ON THE FPS-20 CAN BE REACHED, BUT INSPECTION OF THE SITE AND THE RADAR MAINTENANCE RECORD WOULD REVEAL IF THIS WAS DUE TO A DEAD AREA OF FAULTY EQUIPMENT.

UFO was observed on radar, Cape Canaveral, 1957, 11 April 61. It was observed for at least 30 minutes. Object appeared to orbit in an orbit which extended from 10 miles from the Cape to a position approximately 35 miles from Cape Canaveral and the orbit was at all times on an azimuth of 132째 to 157째 SE of Cape Canaveral. According to radar reports the object disappeared when it got 14 miles away from Cape Canaveral appearing on radar and disappearing at the farthest end 6 or 7 miles. Made 6 or 7 long orbits. The object finally disappeared approximately 15:30Z. In the direction about 152째 away from Cape Canaveral.

Radar Operator on an APS-8 radar. He could paint the object very well. The painting of the object was approximately 1/2 inch or a 1/2째 diameter with no transponder operating. This radar was _____ tracking _____ was good. Atmospheric conditions were normal. There was no detection of this object on any other radar equipment. Except weather radar equipments reports differ as to whether this UFO was extremely high or extremely low.

The weather was -- high overcast, visibility 10 miles, wind ENE at 10 knots on the surface. No temperature inversion.

THIS AIRCRAFT FLEW ABOVE A RADAR GROUND CONTROL AT A HEADING OF 120 DEGREES AT AN ALTITUDE OF 55,000 FEET AND PROCEEDED 230-273 MILES DOWN RANGE.
WHEN IT APPROACHED THE 220 MILE POINT, A SOFT RETURN APPEARED ON THE SCOPE BUT SOON DIED OUT.
THE U-2 LEVELED OFF AT 50 MILES FROM THE CAPE. AT THIS POINT, THE SCOPE SHOWED A HARD TARGET AT ABOUT 220 MILES, BUT THERE IS NO RECORD OF THIS TARGET BEING IDENTIFIED.
IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE U-2 TURN WAS UP OR DOWN AND OFF THE STRENGTH OF THE RADAR.
THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT EACH TIME THE U-2 TURNED, THE PAINT DISAPPEARED. A CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF THE U-2 POSITION PLOTTED BY CAPE RADAR AND THE POSSIBLE REFLECTIONS ON THE FPS-16 RADAR WERE MADE.

Dear Mrs. Corley:
This is in reply to your letter of February 27, 1961 concerning the unidentified flying object observed by your husband on February 20, 1961 at Cape Canaveral, Florida.
I am sorry that I cannot give you any more information regarding this incident than you already have. As you know, the Air Force thoroughly investigates all reports of unidentified flying objects, but in many cases an adequate explanation cannot be determined from the available evidence.
In this case, it appears that the object was seen only for a short period of time and no photographs were obtained. Without further details or corroborating information, there is little we can add to the report you have already made.
I regret that I cannot be of more assistance in this matter. If any additional information becomes available, I will be sure to let you know.
Sincerely yours,
FPC

INCOMING MESSAGE

AF IN : 28780 (21 Apr 61)

CAPT WALTER FLINT, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE TEST, NOTIFIED THE LOCAL GCI SITE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE UFO. HOWEVER, NO INTERCEPT ACTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THE GCI FPS-20 RADAR PICKED UP THE UFO ONLY ONCE EACH THREE SWEEPS OVER AN INTERVAL OF 36 SECONDS AND RECEIVED NO TARGET ON WHICH TO VECTOR THE HEIGHT FINDER.

PART II. ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE DATA LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TARGET WAS REAL. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE REPORT TO SUGGEST RADAR MALFUNCTION, OR FALSE ECHOES, BECAUSE THE TRACKS WERE APPARENTLY WELL DEFINED AND HAD A DEFINITE PATTERN. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS A RELATIVELY SMALL TARGET DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT CONSISTENTLY FADED AT 44 MILES OUTBOUND IN ITS ORBIT AND REAPPEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 44 MILES INBOUND. THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON FOR THE INABILITY OF THE POWERFUL FPS-20 TO TRACK THE TARGET, UNLESS THIS EQUIPMENT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AT THIS TIME OR THE TARGET WAS IN A DEAD AREA FOR THE STATION.

PART III. SINCE NO HEIGHT FINDER DATA WAS OBTAINED CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS MUST BE MADE RELATIVE TO THE TARGET HEIGHT. THE MINIMUM REPORTED RANGE OF THE TARGET WAS 10 MILES. SINCE THIS IS SLANT RANGE AND FURTHER SINCE THE MAXIMUM VERTICAL ANGLE COVERAGE OF THE FPS-20 IS 25-30 DEGREE, THE MAXIMUM TARGET HEIGHT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 30,000 FEET WHICH OBVIOUSLY RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO.

CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE FPS-8 HEIGHT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PAINT THE TARGET.
PART IV. CONTACT WITH LT/COL JAMES O. PAYNE, AFTEC, REVEALED THAT NO NAVY OPERATION COULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIGHTING, AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIMILAR INCIDENTS DURING SUBSEQUENT TESTS.
PART V. IT IS CONCLUDED BY ATC THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED ON RADAR AT CAPE CANAVERAL ON 11 APR 61 AT 1437Z WAS PROBABLY A REAL TARGET, FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF NO MORE THAN 35,000 FEET. NO DEFINITE EXPLANATION OF WHY THIS TARGET DID NOT APPEAR ON THE FPS-8 CAN BE REACHED, BUT INSPECTION OF THE SITE AND THE RADAR MAINTENANCE RECORD WOULD REVEAL IF THIS WAS DUE TO A DEAD AREA OF FAULTY EQUIPMENT. THIS ORGANIZATION EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE CASE.

PART I. FOR AFCIN MAJ GEN WALSH AND FOR RDY MAJ GEN WATSON
AT 1457 H 21 APR 61 AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED
ON RADAR IN THE VICINITY OF CAPE CANAVERAL PRIOR TO THE
LAUNCHING OF TEST NUMBER 1392, POLARIS MISSILE, SCHEDULED
T 14352. THREE EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS WATCHED THE TARGET
ON AN FPS-8 RADAR FOR 30 MINUTES AND ESTIMATED ITS SPEED AS
RANGING BETWEEN 150 AND 600 KNOTS. THESE OBSERVERS REPORTED
THAT THE OBJECT ORBITED 6 OR 7 TIMES ALONG AN AZIMUTH OF 135
DEGREES FROM CAPE CANAVERAL AND BETWEEN 10 AND 25 MILES FROM
THE CAPE. THE RANGE OBSERVERS' ESTIMATES OF THE HEIGHT OF THE
UFO DID NOT AGREE, REPORTING EITHER THE OBJECT WAS VERY LOW
OR VERY HIGH. A RANGE SURVEILLANCE C-54 WAS VECTORED TO WITHIN
2 1/2 MILES OF THE OBJECT BUT REPORTS FROM THE CREW WERE NEGATIVE.
THE RANGE C-54 IS EQUIPPED WITH AN APS-42 AND AN APS-39 RADARS
BUT UTILIZED ONLY THE APS-42 DURING THIS ATTEMPTED INTERCEPT.

INCOMING MESSAGE

AF IN : 28780 (21 Apr 61)
CAPT WALTER FLINT, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE TEST, NOTIFIED THE
LOCAL GCI SITE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE UFO. HOWEVER, NO INTERCEPT
ACTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THE GCI FPS-20 RADAR PICKED
UP THE UFO ONLY ONCE EACH THREE SWEEPS OVER AN INTERVAL OF
36 SECONDS AND RECEIVED NO TARGET ON THE HEIGHT FINDER.
PART II. ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE DATA LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT THE TARGET WAS REAL. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE REPORT TO
SUGGEST RADAR MALFUNCTION, OR FALSE ECHOES, BECAUSE THE TRACKS
WERE APPARENTLY WELL DEFINED AND HAD A DEFINITE PATTERN. IT IS
BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS A RELATIVELY SMALL TARGET DUE TO THE
FACT THAT IT CONSISTENTLY FADED AT A RANGE OUTBOUND IN ITS ORBIT
AND REAPPEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 44 MILES INBOUND. THERE IS NO
LOGICAL REASON FOR THE INABILITY OF THE POWERFUL FPS-20 TO TRACK
THE TARGET, UNLESS THIS EQUIPMENT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AT
THIS TIME OR THE TARGET WAS IN A DEAD AREA FOR THE STATION.
PART III. SINCE NO HEIGHT FINDER DATA WAS OBTAINED CERTAIN
DEDUCTIONS MUST BE MADE RELATIVE TO THE TARGET HEIGHT. THE MINIMUM
REPORTED RANGE OF THE TARGET WAS 10 MILES, SINCE THIS IS SILENT
RANGE AND FURTHER SINCE THE MAXIMUM VERTICAL ANGLE COVERAGE OF THE
FPS-20 IS 25-30 DEGREE THE MAXIMUM TARGET HEIGHT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY
30,000 FEET WHICH OBVIOUSLY RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO
BEING A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

THE UF-100, APPROXIMATELY 400 YARDS WHICH WAS BEING TRACKED ON THE SAME RADAR SCREEN AND UPON FINAL DEPARTURE OF THE UFO IT ATTAINED A SPEED ESTIMATED BY THE RADAR OF 600 MPH. THIS SPEED, WHICH INCLUDES LAUNCH ASSIST, WAS MEASURED WHICH CONSIDERS VERY CRITICAL TO THE AZIMUTH OF THE UFO APPARENTLY 12,355 DEGREES. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE REPORTING OFFICER THAT THIS UFO WAS OF EXTRAORDINARY TYPE OF VEHICLE AND IT IS CONSIDERED UNLIKELY OF US TYPE VEHICLE WHICH WAS OBSERVED TEST OPERATIONS WITH A CONTINUING KNOWLEDGE OF THE MISSILE LAUNCH STATUS.

INVESTIGATION CONCLUSION: NEGATIVE.

FROM AFCIN-4E2
FOR AFCIN Maj Gen Walsh and For RDY Maj Gen Watson. 
AT 1457 z, 11 April 61 an unidentified flying object was sighted on radar in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral. Three experienced observers watched the target on an FPS-16 radar for 30 minutes and estimated its speed as ranging between 1500 and 6000.  These observers reported that the object orbited 6 or 7 times along an azimuth of 126 degrees from Cape Canaveral and distance of 50 to 85 miles. The radar observers' estimates of the height of the UFO did not agree, some reporting the object as very low and others that it was extremely high. A range surveillance G-2 was vectored to within 2-1/2 miles of the object but reports from the aircraft were negative. No other intercept action was accomplished because GCI FPS-20 radar picked up the UFO only intermittently.
