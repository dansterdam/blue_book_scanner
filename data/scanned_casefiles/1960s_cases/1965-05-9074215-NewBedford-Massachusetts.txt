SUBJECT: UFO REPORT
TO: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMMAND 
WRIGHT PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

While driving around a 1966 est. 29 May 65,
I Observed an object which moved rapidly at a low Altitude over my car. It appeared to be giving off a bright orange-reddish light. 
The object hovered for a moment, then moved rapidly away. I Thought I saw a reflection or light in the windshield, but when I looked up the object was gone.
The color appeared as a bright orange-reddish and moved rapidly, and seemed to emit light.
The weather was clear except for some scattered clouds. The object came closer because the shape seemed to be more distinct.
Then the colors appeared to move rapidly northwest and disappeared.
