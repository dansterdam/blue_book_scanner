29 May 1965

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT
TO: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMMAND
WRIGHT PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

While during central at 1946 EST, 29 May 65,
I observed an "apparent" unusual flying activity.
The attached page showed my poor observation.
I thought I saw a helicopter which had all
it's windows having a bright white light.

Then other colors appeared as it moved apparently
northward and were mainly red and green. The
color then increased as the UFO moved further
northward and slightly a midpoint.

The weather was clear except for the
mile close to the north. There may have been
this area looks because the stars were not
bright.
