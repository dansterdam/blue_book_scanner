Transcribed text from the document:

"That Wisconsin "UFO"

In the early morning hours of 5 September 1948, a young housewife, Mrs. Warren Frazier, resident of Westby, Wisconsin, witnessed an extraordinary and spectacular aerial phenomenon. She called the local police and sheriff's office, since the object which had descended through the atmosphere several small and one large burst of light, causing pieces to fall to the ground, continued to hover approximately fifty feet from the ground. The cry of "UFO" was coined, and soon citizens,
law officers, and amateur "UFO" researchers and photographers rushed to the scene. It became quite apparent that the abovementioned incident had alarmed the local populace, and the object which had burned and broke up coming into the earth's atmosphere had caused quite a stir and commotion."

The image contains a document page from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The page contains handwritten text, but there is no photograph or image visible.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

This day-biddr, 7 sept. 17 sup- SCIENTISTS RAN A SERIES OF
TESTS TO LOCATE A CHUNK OF JAGGAR'S METAL TO DETERMINE
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND WEIGHT. THE METAL WAS LOCATED
IN THE RUBBLE -- ONLY 2 LBS IN WEIGHT. THE FIRST
CHEMICAL ANALYSIS INDICATED IT TO BE STAINLESS STEEL.
THE AMOUNT OF THE METAL RECOVERED WAS VERY SMALL
COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT REPORTED BY EYE WITNESSES TO BE
SEEN ON THE GROUND. IT IS TO BE PRESUMED THAT MOST OF
THE MATERIAL WAS VAPORIZED AT THE TIME OF LANDING.
EIGHT AIRFORCE PERSONEN AND FIVE CIVILIANS, INCLUDING
PHYSICISTS, AERODYNAMICISTS, METALLURGISTS AND CHEMISTS, 
MADE A CAREFUL VISUAL AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE
CRASH SITE AND THE METAL SAMPLES. OBSERVATIONS AND 
FIRST TESTS WERE MADE. FURTHER ANALYSIS AND STUDIES
ARE TO CONTINUE.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document discussing a "Chunk of Sputnik" and a "RUSSIANS REJECT CHUNK OF METAL OFFERED BY U.S."

Here is the text from the document:

RUSSIANS REJECT CHUNK OF METAL OFFERED BY U.S.
American Denies Claim Fragment As Evidence of "Dramatic" Move is Hit
Soviet Official Says Blackened Steel Alloy Is Not From Sputnik
UNITED STATES SPACE AGENCY SAYS:
Chunk Came From Sputnik IV - Satellite Launched on May 15, 1960 and Disintegrated in Atmosphere.
"This does not appear to be from Sputnik V. Moscow declined to accept the chunk as evidence of a "dramatic" move of some kind and said it did not come from the Soviet satellite."
Moscow declined to accept the chunk as evidence of a "dramatic" move of some kind and said it did not come from the Soviet satellite.
Soviet scientists examined the fragment and determined it was not from Sputnik.
"It has not the slightest connection with any Soviet space vehicle," a Soviet spokesman said.
He said the fragment appeared to be a steel alloy, blackened by entry into the atmosphere, but Moscow rejected the American contention that it was part of Sputnik.
The United States Space Agency said the fragment came from Sputnik IV, a satellite launched on May 15, 1960, which disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere.

- page 15 -

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be part of the Soviet satellite Sputnik IV. The image is accompanied by text describing the object as "man-made, but there's no trademark" and suggesting that it is made of metal.

IS IT PART OF SPUTNIK IV?
Metal is Man-Made, But There's No Trademark

SOVIET REJECTS OFFER OF PIECE OF SPUTNIK

UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Sept. 6 - The Soviet Union has rejected the United Nations' offer to have a piece of the Soviet Sputnik IV satellite,
which fell to earth last week, placed in the U.N.'s memorabilia collection. The Soviet delegate told the U.N. that "while the offer was appreciated, the
Soviet Union feels that the satellite should remain where it landed as a symbol of the Soviet achievement in the exploration of outer space." The United
Nations had asked the Soviet Union to let it have a piece of the satellite for display. The spokesman said that the Russian delegate, Valerian Zorin,
stated that the Soviet Union could not comply with the request, as the pieces now were part of the Soviet patrimony.

(1) Reference is made to your call of 4 Oct 1962.

(2) The object described is considered as almost certainly atmospheric in nature.

(3) The height, exact size, and other specific identifying characteristics of the object were not determined. (4) Attempts to locate the object or obtain any additional factual information have not been successful.

(5) Based on the limited data available, it is considered that the observed phenomena was most likely some type of aircraft, weather balloon, or other familiar aerial object. No evidence has come to light indicating the object was an unidentified flying object of extraordinary nature.

(6) If any further information is obtained which would indicate the observed object was of an extraordinary nature, this office will be advised immediately. However, at the present time, the available data does not warrant further investigation or special reporting.

DATE RECEIVED: 26 Sep 62

FACTUAL DATA:
Chemical analysis shows the material to be a special glass-like substance. The material is not naturally occurring and appears to have been man-made. The material has a crystalline structure and high refractive index. Further examination indicates the material is a type of toughened glass or ceramic material. No metallic or other foreign inclusions were found.

DATE - 22/9/1952
Our Crop (?) was flying a object a little over a half an our. We were at the base of the Cascade Mountains on the eastern slope, at a point about 3 miles south of the town of Quincy, Washington. The object appeared to be a discallite at a distance and had a glowing light all around it, only slightly brighter than the glow. The object appeared to be at an altitude of about 1,000 feet and was moving slowly at about 30 mph. The object finally disappeared from sight slowly in a northerly direction.
