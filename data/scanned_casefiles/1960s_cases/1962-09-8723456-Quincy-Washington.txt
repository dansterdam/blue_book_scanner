NEWS BRIEFS: Twenty-four UFO's were spotted moving in single file across the sky over Hawaii College campus in Manoa. Last September 4th, "they resembled shooting stars but were paced out, one after another" across the sky, and "they dimly had up, and said Capt. Stanley Kanakanui of Wilcox County. The Deputy added that checks by radio and telephone indicated that flying objects were sighted at the same time by police authorities in that vicinity within an area of 20 miles.

That Wisconsin "UFO":
In the early morning hours of 5 September 1962, residents in Minnesota and Wisconsin witnessed a spectacular and awesome sight: Brilliant, glowing red objects appearing to be in formation, streamed down through the atmosphere. Several small and one large piece of residue landed in Marshfield, Wisconsin. The cry of "UFO" and "censorship" went out among UFO researchers and enthusiasts, but as the information streamlined to APRO headquarters it became quite apparent that the above-mentioned witnesses had observed the dying throes of a Russian satellite as it burned and broke up coming into earth's atmosphere.

CAMBRIDGE, MASS., SEPT. 7 (UPI)--SCIENTISTS RAN A SERIES OF TESTS TODAY ON A 2½-POUND CHUNK OF JAGGED METAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS PART OF THE RUSSIAN SATELLITE SPUTNIK IV.

THE HUNK OF METAL WAS FOUND ON A MANITOWOC, WIS. STREET WEDNESDAY AND SOON AFTER.

SCIENTISTS HAD EXPECTED SPUTNIK IV TO BREAKUP WEDNESDAY. SHORTLY BEFORE THE PIECE OF METAL WAS FOUND IN THE WISCONSIN SKY, DR. FRED L. WHIPPLE, DIRECTOR OF THE SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY, SAID THE FIRST TESTS WERE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE OBJECT WAS RADIO-ACTIVE.

PUTIN IV WAS LAUNCHED MAY 15, 1961 AND UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THAT IT POSSIBLY CONTAINED A MAN. ANOTHER UNCONFIRMED REPORT SAID THE SATELLITE HAD A DUMMY ABOARD.

THE METAL IN QUESTION WAS FOUND BY TWO POLICEMEN. AT BUS OR TRUCK A THREE-INCH HOLE IN THE GROUND. OFFICIALS SAID LIKE SCENE IN ROAD WAS POWDERED, AS IF BY EXTREME HEAT. A LABORATORY SPOKE MAN SAID THE TESTS MAY TAKE FIVE DAYS.

That Chunk of Sputnik
After a series of bright, metallic objects had shown in Middle Western skies, and cops picked up a 20-lb. piece of hot steel on a quiet Wisconsin street, word got out that a Soviet Sputnik had broken up above the U.S. The steel was rushed to the Smithsonian. Astrogeological Observatory in Washington said the piece was cut off. The rest went to Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico to be tested for radioactivity. Last week, skeptics who had all along suspected a hoax, got an official disappointment: the steel really came from a Sputnik.

First report was from Los Alamos. Radiation test, Dr. Ernest C. Anderson of the Smithsonian, was so cautious that it shown by natural decay gives free clues to from distant Space have turned some of its iron atoms to unstable magnetic 54, which gives off radiation while it is decaying to stable chromium 54. This is good proof that the object was part of a spacecraft that had orbited for a long time above the U.S. The piece that fell on Manitowoc, Wis., probably came from the breakup of Sputnik IV, the five-ton Russian satellite that was launched on May 15, 1960 and disintegrated Sept. 5, 1962.

No one was sure what part of the Sputnik it was. It is a chunk of steel, roughly lens-shaped, with one face smooth and the other covered with very rough steel that looks as if it had melted and then hardened again. This could have happened if the chunk moved white-hot through the atmosphere with the smooth side forward and the rough side to the cooler next side and solidify there.

Los Alamos experts do not want anyone to get the idea that metal which has been exposed to space is a dangerously radioactive. The Sputnik chunk, they say, is less radioactive than many kinds of granite rock found in the U.S.

RUSSIANS REJECT
CHUNK OF METAL
OFFERED BY U.S.
American Delegate Cites
Fragment As Evidence Of
Need For Agreement

"DRAMATIC" MOVE IS HIT
Soviet Official Says Blackened Steel Aimed At
Wrong Target Here
(By The Associated Press)
UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 14. —
The United States offered the
Soviet Union today a "dramatic"
piece of blackened steel returned by American scientists to
prove some of the parts of Sputnik had fallen on U.S. territory in outer space. The Soviet Union rejected it, saying it was aimed at the wrong target here.

U. S. Delegate Francis T. Plimpton told the U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and said it had fallen on a street in Manitowoc, Wis., early on Sept. 5.

He said it was tangible evidence
of a need for an international
agreement on damage from objects launched into space. The United States
invited the Soviet Union through Plimpton to have the fragment. He also said he would be glad to turn it over to the Soviet Union if the Soviet delegation "now or at any time of his choosing."

Instead of accepting the object
Anatoly A. Ragulov, the Soviet
delegate, said the United States
should first prove the fragment
means . . . to divert our attention from great international issues being discussed under general legal principles on space exploration. This is being pursued by the Soviet Union.

But he declared, "This piece of
metal is not evidence of anything. It is being thrown at me by Mr. Plimpton of the United States
... won't hit the target."

Moreover, "the results would be the same" for a detailed investigation of the fragment, he said.

After the meeting, Soviet Space Expert Anatoly A. Blagovarov just picked up the chunk of metal, walked out of the room without looking at it over, the told a reporter the exhibit was "at odds with the intention to strengthen the Soviet position" against the Soviet-proposed declaration.

Plimpton told the committee whether he eventually would accept the fragment. But he said in the United States had a claim against the Soviet Union for damage from objects launched into space, international procedures for submitting such claims.

Plimpton, talking with reporters, crossed the room to the Manitowoc street department might have a claim against the Soviet Union for the street but no claim had come to the State Department. He wrapped the thing in cardboard and took it back to the U. S.

"The object is black, about 10 inches across and two inches thick and sharpened like a small, ground case casting on a cushion of foam."

Plimpton's aide explained that the fragment, substance is metal and, allowed around to the back, was found corroded. It had been cut across one edge to show that the inside is silvery.

Plimpton told the committee he weighed 20 pounds but the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, he said, had cut off a six-pound piece for scientific analysis.

"Analysis by the Smithsonian Laboratory and four other laboratories have shown it is an alloy steel and that it had been in outer space for a considerable time."

"Fortunately, the fragment was on this side and shows serious damage on impact, but the possibilities of harm are evident."

Soviet Rejects
Offer Of Piece
Of Sputnik 4

UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., (AP)—The United States today offered the Soviet Union a piece of the Sputnik 4 spacecraft that landed in Manitoba, Wis., in the early morning hours of Sept. 5.

U.S. Delegate Francis T. P. Plimpton made the offer at a meeting of the U.N. committee on peaceful uses of outer space, making a concrete gesture of real cooperation in peaceful exploration.

The scrap was caught Plimpton D. Moynihan, the Soviet delegate, by surprise and he made no immediate reply to accept the offer. Moscow had just concluded an attack on U.S. policy in the outer space committee.

After the meeting, Moynihan was asked if the Soviets would walk out of the committee room without accepting the fragment. He smiled and declined the offer "a circus trick intended to strengthen the U.S. position" against a Soviet-proposed declaration of legal principles.

He declined to say whether in eventuality the chunk of metal (the United States says it is a spacecraft preparation, there is an international procedure for submitting it).

Informed of the Soviet comment, Plimpton said smiling to reporters that the Manitoba occurrence was a surprise to the Soviets since the object had made a hole 1 1/2 feet.

IS IT PART OF SPUTNIK IV?
Kenneth Geers holds scorched fragment of metal found on street

Metal Is Man-Made, But There's No Trademark

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)—The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory said today that a metal fragment found in Wisconsin could be a fragment of the 10,000-pound Sputnik 4 which broke up over Wisconsin's skies. The fragment was found in Manitowoc, Wis., and sent to Smithsonian.

The North American Air Defense Command reported the object broke up shortly after a battery to what country it came from.

Our Crew (KC135, 726) assigned to the F22 AREFS was flying a Caloret mission. We were at FL 350 making good a track of true north. At approx 2 we observed what appeared to be an aircraft with a landing light on at our level about 5° right of the nose of our aircraft. The object did not appear to move for about 1 minute, then moved to the east slowly, at first but accelerated rapidly, and disappeared to the east. After a few minutes, I got to the closest approach, after a line of sight with the object.
