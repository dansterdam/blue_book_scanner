UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location 20 miles S. of Battle Creek, Michigan

Date 20 June 1960    Hour (Z) 2130Z

WX High scattered clouds, vis 15°, winds westerly at 15 to 50 knots

Description Box shaped, size of pencil erasure, silvery-reflected sunlight, three objects in line formation approx 2 miles apart, first seen 50 deg elev, last seen 30 to 35 deg elev, moved at very slow rate of speed in a straight and level path, seen for about 5 minutes

Direction of Motion South

Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219) Duration excessive, and could not be seen this time of day

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) too slow for meteor, too fast for planet

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1)    None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc) -----

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. Possibly Helicopters

Other

Evaluation of Source Reliability Unknown

Analysis and Conclusions: One witness identified the objects as probably helicopters. The objects were in sight approximately five minutes and during this period moved over considerable angular distance. The absence of sound is one to distance and wind direction, which was generally from the witnesses point toward the object. The image was two objects located 100 to determine if helicopters were in the area.

Here is the text I can clearly read from the document:

"NET WITH FAILURE. THE CHECKS, MADE ON THE INFORMATION PERIOD BY THE WITNESSES, COULD POSSIBLY BE HELICOPTERS.

IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECTS OF THIS SIGHTING WERE PROBABLY HELICOPTERS."

The text is followed by a signature at the bottom right of the page.

The rest of the document appears to be mostly illegible due to the image quality and faded text.

- page 4 -

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely grainy and low-quality black and white photograph with significant noise and distortion. While there is a white dot or spot visible in the upper right area of the image, the text is completely illegible. I cannot make out any readable text on this page.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality and graininess of the scanned document. There appears to be some text, but it is not clearly readable. The image looks like a black and white document page with heavy noise and low contrast.

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely grainy and low quality. While it seems to be a black and white document or photograph, the text is completely illegible due to the heavy noise and poor resolution of the scan. I cannot make out any readable text from this image.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality and graininess of the scanned document. There are some faint lines and markings visible, but no clear, readable text can be discerned from this image.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality and graininess of the scanned document. There appears to be a small white dot in the upper right portion of the image, but no clear text can be discerned.

The 8mm strip was examined as closely as possible, and all that could be seen was and oblong orange light. There was no detail whatever, and the image was so small, even when enlarged several times it was impossible to identify the image.

This case includes five(5) 8"x10" photographs and one(1) 5½"x3¾" negative.
