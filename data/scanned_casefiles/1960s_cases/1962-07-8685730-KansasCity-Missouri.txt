Gentlemen,

On the evening of July 22, 1962, at approximately 7:45 P.M., my neighbor, nightlor, and I saw a bright moving object about five to ten miles up, moving in a southeasterly direction at about five to six thousand miles an hour.

We were driving the main with an nightly power telescope. We were able to get a sight on the H. F. 2. but could tell no detail because of the rapid movement.

The sky was clear except for a cloud bank in the low southwest that the H. F. 2. finally went behind.

From where we were the object looked about one size of a pea. The estimated it to be eight hundred to one thousand feet across. It was very bright & was white in color, but wasn't the usual color.

I am enclosing a letter at Eastgate, Tex. height & length, 125 Ruskin, Mo. and a
