The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a project blue book document with various information fields filled out, including the date, location, source, number of objects, length of observation, type of observation, course, and physical evidence. The text in the "Brief Summary and Analysis" field describes the observer's observations, noting that the object was unidentified. There is no image or photograph included in this page.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer spotted the object through the wind screen as he was driving. The object was round and silvery in color. It appeared to be stationary at first, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The observer could not determine any discernible features or outlines. The duration was approximately 60 seconds. Although it is possible that some type of aircraft or other conventional object could have been observed, such an explanation is not corroborated with the available information. Considering the available information, the case is being carried as unidentified.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten questionnaire or report document.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 6 April 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or is overative explanation of your sighting:

There were several very brightly lighted objects in the sky moving in a very erratic manner. There were at least 3 objects. They were hovering and moving very rapidly from one point in the sky to another point. The objects seemed to be controlled, and were constantly changing course and speed. Their speed was estimated to be around 1000 mph or greater. The objects appeared to be about the size of a small aircraft, perhaps a light plane or helicopter. They were very bright, apparently self-luminous. They illuminated an area of the sky as they moved about. The sighting lasted for about 15 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before, and cannot offer any explanation as to what they were. I am a reasonably skeptical person, and have no preconceived ideas about UFOs, but this sighting has left me quite puzzled.

The image appears to contain a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky. The object is dark in color and has an elongated, oblong shape. The background appears to be a clear sky with some faint markings or distortions that may be artifacts from the scanning or reproduction process.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a sketch and a compass. The sketch appears to be an instruction or exercise asking the viewer to imagine a scenario where an object is observed above the horizon and to depict its motion on the sketch. The compass shown in the image is likely provided as a reference for the sketch.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
80°  75°  70°  65°  60°  55°  50°  45°  40°  35°  30°  25°  20°  15°  10°  5°  0°
N  NW  W  SW  S  SE  E  NE  N

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
