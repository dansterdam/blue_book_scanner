SAFOI-34/MEBurnard/72291

27 February 1961

Dear [redacted]

I read with interest your letter of 18 February 1961 in which you outlined the purpose of your new organization, SKY WATCHERS, and are sure that you and your fellow members will find this a most interesting hobby, the study of the sky and its stars.

The Air Force policy is to encourage people who sight unidentified flying objects to report them to the Intelligence or Operations Officer at the nearest Air Force installation.

To Altus, when you reported your sighting of 17 February to Altus Air Force Base, you were doing as the Air Force would like you to do. Also, I am sure your watch for tornadoes will be of interest to the nearest Weather Bureau which tracks these storms by radar.

For your information we are inclosing the latest Department of Defense Fact sheet on UFOs. This clearly states the position of the Air Force and the Department of Defense on this controversial subject.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM M. MACK
Captain, USAF
Public Information Division

February 18, 1961

Secretary of Defense
Washington 25, D. C.

Sir:

I thought of a new organization to help our defenses in one way. The name of the organization is "SKY WATCHERS" and it is very much like the GOC except the Sky Watchers will watch for UFO's and tornadoes.

I sent the name of the Sky Watchers and details to the President within a design of a similar patch. Due to the President receiving so much mail - I doubt if he or his secretary has seen my letter - it was mailed about 2 weeks ago.

Why not have men throughout the United States at certain points with cameras with telescopic lens to take movies of any UFO's they may sight.

Yesterday I sighted an UFO over Vernon and reported it to the Altus Air Force Base. I do not have a movie. I believe ALL UFO's should be reported to the nearest Air Force base. THEN NOTIFY the local authorities.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]
Vernon, Texas
