10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round object aprox 1/5 size of moon sighted to NW by several witnesses. Object was orange in color and appeared to be moving either toward or away from witness. Object disappeared vertically, then reappeared after 2 min moving toward SW. When first sighted, it had elevation of aprox 15°, when it reappeared had elevation of aprox 75°.

11. COMMENTS
Venus was in a direction coincident with that reported for the object. The planet was just setting and was at magnitude 3. Witnesses probably observed Venus and misidentified it and associated motion with its atmospheric refraction. Orange color also an effect of refraction. Just as Venus set, B-47 reported in area was probably passing another object and witnesses thought it was the same object.
