35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Multiple and sighted this "bulb" about the railroad bridge in my home town. We observed it at first, and then proceeded across the Sabine River bridge into Texas. It moved with tremendous speed until it reached Beaumont, Texas, and then we were able to keep in close range as we made our way down a farm and market road. We were what I consider extremely close as it would go out completely and reappear on the opposite side of the road. At times it would stop completely and we assumed it was actually waiting for us to catch up. Finally, it would approach us, occasionally when we made a wide turn, after a while, it cut directly across the farmland back to the Tenaha, Texas highway. We made our way back to this highway and got close to it again. I got out of the car at a point approximately half way between Joaquin and Tenaha, Texas, and the Polish ask may seem, tried to contact the ship verbally. I was aware some omits way toward Tenaha again, where we reached Tenaha we could follow it more because the ship followed again.

We own a beach resort and after closing July 4, 1966, we took our employees down to the beach and had a fireworks display.
I wasn't there during the display but after it about 1/2 hour we all were going to take a swim. (The Special Officer I mention on other page stood on a Jetty that a wooden plank protruding into the bay to hold the sand on the beach)

Mr. [name blacked out] and I went to the beach to wade into the water when I saw this object which I thought to be a falling star. I said "don't look it's a falling star," (which to my family means there will be a death in the family) so turned and when we looked again it hadn't a fallen but was coming toward us and much lower.

It got brighter and moved in a sigsag motion, we called to the other on the jetty and as I talk to some it could tell us what it was, at first he said it was a jet. then he said, "No I've never seen anything like it." He called to the others in the water and they were so frightened by it they got out of the water and we all stood on the beach and watched it. At this point it had come very close to us and then went to the right and very high under another ball of lite ### and they both went higher until we couldn't see them.

There were just two of us as we watch the place at nite. I was waiting for my daughter to come home from a date. Out on a picnic table we were having a coke, about 12.25 and I looked up and saw this thing I thought was a star at first move and signac across the sky I showed the person I was with and watched it;(my daughter had come home in the mean time and gone inside) We called her out to see it and she at first thought it was a plane but after watching it said it couldn't be.(She flies a plane and now works at Lee's Airport Elginwarer, Maryland.)

I have seen more but no one would even know they are not stars if they haven't had the sightings I have had.

Gentlemen:

My name is [redacted] and I would like to submit the following UFO report:

On July 6, 1966, at approximately 6:30 P.M., I happened to glance toward the western sky. As I looked, I noticed a silver metallic cigar-shaped object traveling slowly across the sky. The object had a light on the bottom and had a wobbling motion. After three seconds, the object disappeared behind a cloud, hidden from my view.

Recently, I submitted this report to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena and this committee was very interested in my report. At that a picture of the object might seem clear in your mind, I have...

Case TO old to investigate

Proposed reply to letter from [illegible] 29 March 1967

Dear Mr [illegible]

Reference your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object on 6 July 1966. Since you have just reported the incident to the Air Force, a detailed scientific investigation is not possible. If you had reported your observation to the Air Force shortly after 6 July, a meaningful scientific investigation would have been possible. The report will be filed for information purposes only.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location.
I have seen a fuzzy cigar shaped object from surrounds three the clouds toward large airborne base but this thing didn't have any markings that I could see this was 9:50 AM, Aug 24, 1966

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent.
I am always on the lookout for clues of this sort as I know there have been strange objects for quite sometime I am really trying to figure out how they are powered & I think it is strictly by electricity such as that of lightning. The only thing is to harness such power for useful purposes.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
I didn't tell anyone because I thought they were air boys used for guiding planes in it will seem since they didn't know while we were watching.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   3rd   Nov   1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Go ahead here that almost all aspects whatever they are must be powered by a sort of electricity taken from the atmosphere. What people think they are probably driven by some sort of fuel but that's impossible since there wouldn't be no storage space for such space.

Now atomic energy in some advanced form could provide just that type of power without having to have too much of a payload. Since these objects that are usually seen changing directions at 90Â° and dart off at enormous speeds you know there isn't a weight factor at all. You ask yourself how can these objects stay airborne without using well they probably create a heavy atmosphere around themselves much like the earth as a whole has around it. And then too these objects could have forced section type gas inflated chambers to keep them afloat this would eliminate a few pounds of far as flight is concerned. They do say a fish in a tank of water won't weigh a thing unless he touches the bottom or lays on the bottom of the tank. Could this sort of thing be true with flying objects in space. I sure hope this information is helpful because if these objects are from someone probably has the jump on us and that's not so good.
