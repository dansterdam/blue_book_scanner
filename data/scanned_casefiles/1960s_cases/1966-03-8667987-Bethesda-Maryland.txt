35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting.

As UFO #1 was almost on horizon, just hovering very fast, there was an instantaneous, extremely bright flash, approx. 45Â° up and to the right. Our attention was attracted to it, naturally. From the location of the flash came UFO #2, traveling very fast. It slowed down, hovered over the other spot on the horizon where UFO #1 had just disappeared. In 2-3 d, it was about 1/2 mile or UFO's ft. of second duration away. The same soft white color was not as intense, either, as UFO #1. We watched it year at 2125 I left with my office soon to take him to a dance; UFO #2 was still hovering. It's subsequent actions, to me bearable, can be deduced, if desired, by the listed witnesses of the report on UFO #1.

The flash was somewhat I had never seen before. If had no color, but that doesn't really describe it for an analogue could be a flash bulb (detached), or an instantaneous magnetic flare or what have you heard for instance. Actually, intuition says it came from UFO #2. No stable high performance visible or stable UFO was but there was certainly an occurrence.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 3-22 March 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Upon return to my home near Bethesda, Maryland, plus a resident of the area, I watched the sky. I went in the house a moment, and, when I came out to look again, a red aircraft, resembling an oval-shaped object, had appeared to be hovering or waiting, at 22:00 hrs. It seemed to be approximately 4 or 5 times the size of a standard aircraft, while it made the usual navigational flashing lights. It continued to hover for a few minutes and then suddenly accelerated at an extremely high rate of speed, ascending vertically and disappearing in a matter of seconds, the difference in its speed in comparison to conventional aircraft was greatly pronounced. At 22:15, we were looking north; don't know the exact direction-but taken place. At this time, a "meteor" flamed across the sky view, plunged downward and out of sight. However, I have never seen one so brilliant and large before, and one sighting so very close to one another. As it cannot constant, l respectfully, have never seen one shocking a piece so display of activity, and I cannot remember it since except as an imagined "motion" of a picture, sho
w as of itself, and all pieces, hindered prior to conclude the horizon.

Important Note:
I am more than glad to cooperate in any way I can gathering of information. On routine duty, I had no choices. I do now. I am also willing to have questions asked of my family, if desired.
Provided - Some small black-known-to-all docsesly condemned. For example, several months after making a report to Chapel Hill re UEO sightings - seen by other pilots, too - was asked OS how much he would be thanked (as did be same done) was assuring in his family, and OS every, so help me, how much he abused himself. Any chance like that, I thus oust private contact with that so-called "investigator" out the house, body, to be treated in such a manner.
I do not demand even an oral (and anything, expressive, in the real sense of the word) record, but I do demand the ordinary decencies a cavalcade. Those standards were observed by rather an investigator, private, whos have already interviewed us.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, showing a letter written by an unnamed individual to Miss Sara Hunt at the Office of Information, Department of the Air Force, Washington, D.C.

The text of the letter is as follows:

31 March 1966

Miss Sara Hunt
Office of Information
Department of the Air Force
Washington, DC

Dear Miss Hunt:

Finally, enclosed are the three reports on the UFOs I saw on 19 March 1966. There have been some delays in getting these to you by telephone; besides, I've never heard of the Air Force doing anything with such UFO sighting reports, anyway. However, as a patriotic American, and as a retired AF officer, I am glad to still find the reports, and send them in. Maybe some day, God and the Administration willing, things will get somewhere. Open and scientific investigation of these phenomena will, I think, find something of great scientific importance. 

I think that you will be interested in reading these reports, especially since you, too, saw one of those strange objects, according to the reports. As you know, Wright-Patterson AFB and I have a number of findings (alas, from WW-II on) on this matter, and can let me know. I'd certainly appreciate it. If the answer is "sworn free", however, you can forget it, for as yours says as well as for me.

The enclosed are still much information to be picked up from the other witnesses; I did NOT fill in any of the reports from them, as I hardly the the scientific method. If you, and/or Wright-Pat wants these additions, however, as I investigate them further, I'll be glad to provide them. However, while I welcome honest investigators bothering my family, while I welcome honest inquirers bothering only my family's and of my family's, any treatment such as I've been meted out to active duty AF personnel who had the conviction will meet with resistance.

Sincerely,

- page 19 -

The UFO advanced very swiftly, it was higher, by far, than least airplane. There were no blinking lights or it. Since it would move momentarily, a second or two at time, I dount seriously, if it wore a satellite, since the color & size did not charge as it appears on binoculars, dont know if the "jet exhaust" explanation will work. I gave very seldom hear able to get a lot better watch out, since there is no real stamp usually dont seriously, if it were swarp gas.

The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a handwritten document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document as follows:

I UFO of experience- not to say the life -- as we walked away on the scene, was a small, slim creature, about 2-3 feet high, it melancholly. 2205; meanwhile, 3 more UFO' were seen.

As we all was almost to mention to have a noise, however, the sound was an extremely higher frequency, higher than insect and my tinnitus almost stopped when it seem to rote the air.

My youngest son was advising the house & how he has seen a yellow, mist with excitement "i've a flying saucer." I saw the dark, he is over 6 feet, his vision was rather acute on the scene, I too, saw the dark (like my eyes when closed) my younger son more with it.

I am repeating what I saw. If other reports are described, the names of the other witnesses are not stated. I have UFO encounters in the same year, details the same things.
