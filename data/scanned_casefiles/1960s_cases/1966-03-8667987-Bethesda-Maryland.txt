35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

As UFO #1 was almost on horizon, still however very fast, there was an instantaneous & extremely bright flash, approx. 45° up and to the right. Our attention was directed to it, naturally. From the location of the flash came UFO #2, travelling very fast, it slowed, then slowed further, & finally hovered over the exact spot on the Northern horizon where UFO #1 had just disappeared. In size, it was about 1/2 that of UFO #1; it seemed further away. The same soft white color was not as intense, either, as UFO #1. We watched it, then at 21/25 I left with my sister son, to take him to a dance; UFO #2 was still hovering. It's subsequent actions, to me hearsay, can be described, if desired, by the listed witnesses on the report on UFO #1.

The flash was something I had never seen before. It had no color, but that doesn't really describe it. An analogue could be a flash bulb (duration), or an instantaneous magnesium flare (of which I've never heard) for intensity. Actually, intuition says it came from UFO #2. No strobe light, it was but this one flash. A weapon?

Note for All desk jockeys, From an almost fed-up pilot.

1) If you didn't, or don't, do your jobs rightly, you get fired/and/or get a bad OFF.

2) If, as a fighter pilot, I didn't do my job correctly (basic ingredients identifying objects in the sky, estimating speeds, etc) I did not survive. In other words, the motivation was higher. I survived!

Upon return to my house, I found my younger son, Hillary, plus a friend, still outside watching the sky. I went in the house momentarily, rejoined him outside, at 2205. We looked for more ago, while he told me of the 3 others (including a big one) he & the others had seen while I was gone. I pointed out to him, nearby, the way to recognize aircraft (blinking lights, patterns, speed, etc), the difference between the twinkling of the stars +the steady glow of the planets.

At 2215, we were looking mostly down Montgomery Ave, in the same area where most of the previous activity had taken place. At this time, a "meteor" flamed into view, plunged earthward, & burned before it reached the horizon. Having many hours of night flying, I have seen hundreds of meteors. However, I have never seen one so large. In addition, I personally have never seen one shedding bits & pieces as it flamed constantly. Those bits & pieces burned separately. I have seen aircraft shell, but not bolts. This "meteor", an irregular ball of colored flame, shed as it self & all pieces, burned prior to reaching the horizon.

Important Note:

I am more than glad to cooperate in the gathering of UFO information. On active duty, I had no choice; I do now I am also perfectly willing to have questions asked of my family, if any are desired — provided, some smart aleck-know-it-all doesn't contradict. For example, cousin Syfert plot, friend of mine, after making a report to Japan upon all UFO sighting, seen by other pilots, too, was asked (1) how much he drank, (2)did he take dope (3) was there any insanity in his family, and (4) ever, so help me, how much he abused himself. Any garbage like that, & this private citizen will throw the so-called "investigation" out the house, bodily; I will not allow my family to be treated in such a fashion.

I do not demand even an open (and, investigator, "scientific" in the real sense of the word) mind, but I do demand the ordinary decencies & courtesies from any UFO investigator. These standards were obscured by the other organizations & private investigators who have already interviewed us.

31 March 1966

Miss Sara Hunt
Office of Information
Department of the Air Force
Washington, DC

Dear Miss Hunt:

Finally, enclosed are the three reports on the UFOs I saw on 19 March 1966. There have been other pressing items since I told with you on the telephone; besides, I've never heard of the AF doing much with such reports, except rat-holing them, anyway.

However, as a particular American, and a retired AF officer, I'm glad to fill in the reports, and send them in. Maybe, some day, God and the Administration willing, there will be an open and scientific investigation of this phenomena.

I think that you will be interested in reading these reports, especially since you, too, saw one of those "flashes" in the sky. And, if you ever do receive any sort of a sensible answer from Wright-Pat, and can let me know, I'd certainly appreciate it. If the answer is "swamp gas", however, you can forget it, for yourself as well as for me.

There is still much information to be picked up from the other witnesses; I did NOT fill in any of the reports from them, as that is hardly the scientific method. If you, and/or Wright-Pat wants these additional reports, they can get them. However, as I noted in the reports themselves, there had better be no investigations bothering my family. While I welcome home investigations both of my sightings, and of my family's, any treatment such as I've seen meted out to active duty AF personnel who had the conviction to report what they had seen, will meet with resistance.

Sincerely,

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

M = 21.2 MC
O = momentary hovering
unobserved while I went in house
to get other viewers(5) who also
saw this, plus 4 other UFO's.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? I SAW ONLY 2 -
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

For UFO #2, see Report (attached)

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    30    March    1966
                                               Day    Month    Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I was in back yard of house, waiting for my close son. When I noticed UFO coming up Southern horizon. Clear night, many aircraft around, since traffic pattern to National Airport was to the South that night. The UFO advanced very swiftly, it was higher, by far, than local aircraft. There were NO blinking navigation lights & no strobe lights on it. Since it would pause momentarily at times, & zig zag at times, I doubt, seriously, if it were a satellite. Where bearing ability is small. Since the color & size did not change as it appeared on record, doubt if the "jet exhaust" explanation will work.

I have very seldom been able to fly a jet backwards. And, since there is no real sharp nearby, doubt seriously if it were sharp gas.

(Pardon - maybe the sarcasm, but five been kicked around on this subject before, even when bore out by other crew members and magnetic aircraft instrument documentation). Since I am now retired, I do not have to subordinate with the party line.

As UFO approached nearer, I ran into our house, to tell my

family - they came out, v all saw the UFO, too. My other son called one of his friends, they with his sister, came out. I left at approximately 21:25, with my other son. The 1st UFO was gone, but the second one was still there.

I returned at approximately 22:05; meanwhile, 3 more UFO's were seen. At 22:15 my youngest son said v I saw the extraordinary "meteor" (3rd report, Bethesda)

As UFO #1 was almost to horizon to create (trees, house, etc), there was an extremely bright & extremely short burst of light, to the right, at 45°. From here or so it looked; came the 2nd UFO.

My younger son raced in the house v got his binoculars, adjusted them, v yelled with excitement: "It's a Flying Saucer, I see the disk"; he was at this time was rather naive on the subject. I took the glasses, v I, too, saw the disk (Note: my eyes are good). My younger son drew a quick sketch of what he saw; we still have it, I think.

I am reporting what I saw. If other reports are desired, the names of the other witnesses are listed. There are additional people, over related, who, I have found out with, saw UFO #1 at the same time - doing the same things.
