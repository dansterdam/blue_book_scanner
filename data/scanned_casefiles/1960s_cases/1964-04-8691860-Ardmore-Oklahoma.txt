Dear Sir:

A recent United Press release by Emily R. Svellis mentioned your project.

I am enclosing a sketch made by me after seeing some type of object on 1-9-64 about 8:10 PM. I am not sure to accuracy on number of windows or size. It was visible long enough to have counted, but the general overall dimensions and construction were so unusual I'm afraid I didn't think on a scientific basis. It appeared much larger than object mentioned in article as seen in New Mexico by W.F. Zamora, more like the old type blimp as I remember them. the cloud in the sketch see med very close, it appeared from back if trees in western sky over garage roof. From angle of object - it must have been in process of sharp turn. The disintegration process of framework became fuzzy started while object was sendingly stationary, but process was quick and object moved on some direction, with framework clouding over when last visible.

If you tell me this was a weather or observation object belonging to the United States, it would make me very happy, since I find myself looking at each cloud with great suspicion. I would be glad to answer any questions if sketch seems of interest, but I would not like to have my name used in relation to the matter.

A stamped addressed envelope is enclosed and I would like to have sketch returned. The reason for sending it along was to avoid a wordy description.

Thank you for your consideration.

Very truly yours,
[Signature redacted]
Ardmore, Oklahoma

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Ardmore, Oklahoma, 9 Apr 64                     27 Jul 64

1. Reference the attached letter from Miss [redacted] requesting information on an unidentified flying object which she observed on 9 Apr 64. This letter is forwarded to your office for reply.

2. The information presented in Miss [redacted] letter contained insufficient data for evaluation. It is suggested that an FTD Form 164 forwarded to her for completion.

3. The object cannot be associated with any known type of weather phenomena since apparently the object had definite shape and construction. The duration was omitted as well as motion of the object. The drawing indicates the probability of an aircraft towing a banner with electrical lights for advertising, with Miss Rollins observing only the banner. Similar sketches have been submitted by witnesses observing this phenomena. She could check the local airport and inquire as to various companies flying these advertising missions. They would no doubt keep a record of flights during Apr 64.

Dear Mrs.

This is in reply to your letter of July 18, 1964, addressed to Captain Quintanilla at the Project Blue Book Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, on the subject of an Unidentified Flying Object you observed.

Enclosed is a Form 164, "U.S. Air Force Technical Information" questionnaire. It is requested that you complete this form and return it to this Headquarters. A self-addressed envelope is enclosed for your convenience. The information given in your letter was not sufficient enough to enable our Project Office to make an evaluation. The object you sketched cannot be associated with any known type of weather phenomena since it apparently had definite shape and construction. The drawing indicates the probability of an aircraft towing a banner with electrical lights for advertising. It may of course be possible that you observed only the banner. Similar sketches have been submitted by persons observing this phenomena. You might check your local airport and inquire as to various companies flying these advertising missions.

In the 164 questionnaire, would you list the duration of the sighting as well as the motion of the object, and complete the other questions in as much detail as possible.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

Dear Sir:

Thank you for acknowledging the sketch submitted. Since you state similar sketches submitted have been determined as advertising banners, I will accept this evaluation.

Due to lapse of time, and fact that I do not have a photo-graphic or scientific mind, it does not appear that completion of your form 164 could be of much technical value.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]
