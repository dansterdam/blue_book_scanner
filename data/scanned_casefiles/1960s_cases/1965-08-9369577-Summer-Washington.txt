UFO Sighting, 13 August 1965

318TS/5304
325th Fighter Wing (Air Defense)
McChord AFB, Washington

1. Reference your letter, 318TS/5304, subject Unidentified Flying Object Report, dated 25 August 1965. Request information regarding the photographs taken by Mr Strafford on the night of 13 August 1965.

2. Initial report indicates that objects were visible for 1 hour and 40 minutes and that the weather was overcast with light rain and visibility of a 5 miles. Request information as to the width of Lake Tapps and the distance from the observer to the town of Buckley, Washington. Would it be possible to observe ground lights in this locality from Sumner, Washington? During what portion of the 1 hour and 40 minute observation were the objects stationary? Also, four objects were reported, how far apart were the three objects near the ground in terms of degrees of arc and what was the distance from these objects with the one in the sky (also in terms of degrees of arc)? The size is apparently extremely large. We request that the witness compare the size of the object to the size of a full moon. Since the observer initially considered the light as a fire, was the Fire Department in Buckley, Washington contacted to determine if a fire was in progress during the time of the report?
