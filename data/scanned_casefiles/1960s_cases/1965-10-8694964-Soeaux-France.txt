1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 13 October 65  13/1720

2. LOCATION: Soeaux (Seine), France

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: No more than 3 min.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: Descending

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Astro (METEOR) Vapor trail and duration of two to three seconds might possibly have been a meteor trail at altitude with reflection of the sun's rays, arising a reddish color in the sky.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Object was observed somewhat east of Paris at a high altitude. Dusk, with sun setting. Observer first thought of Venus, then looked up again to study the object. The object had a long trail of white vapor, thousands of meters in depth and almost perpendicular. The object was a reddish color. The observation lasted no more than three minutes. Once the cloud of vapor had disappeared, nothing more was visible.

Dear [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects.

I am enclosing the current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects. As this report will show, to date we have received no evidence which indicates the existence of "flying saucers". However, should you still desire to submit your report to us after reading this, I will not be necessary to have a translation made by the ambassador in France.

Sincerely,

1.  The attached letter from [redacted] in French, was translated verbally. Mr [redacted] designed a flying saucer based upon one of his observations of such a machine. He has written a document giving the design of this machine. He desires to know if he should give it to the United States Ambassador in France for translation, or to the scientific terms he uses.

2.  It is suggested that a Fact Sheet together with a statement that there is no evidence to indicate the existence of flying saucers, as such, have been brought to the attention of the United States Air Force in more than 9000 reports submitted to them. Should desires to submit his report to us, it is not necessary that translation be made by the Ambassador in France.

1. Reference the attached unidentified object report from
Mr. [redacted]. The previous letter from Mr. [redacted] was answered
on 30 March 1965. At that time he was forwarded a fact sheet.
Mr. [redacted] observed on Object on the night of 13 October 1965,
which he believed to be the separation of a satellite booster
and a subsequent passage of a satellite in orbit. Satellites
launched from the United States normally would not have their
boosters separate over France. A period of one hour and eight
minutes is considerably less than that of orbiting satellites.
The description based on translation on his letter is not consistent with a satellite launch. However, the vapor trail and
duration of two to three seconds might possibly have been a
meteor trail at a wide with the reflection on the sun's rays
giving a reddish color to the object.

2. Information received from SPADATS indicates that there were
no satellites or space debris entering the atmosphere in a state
of decay on 15 August.

Here is the text from the document:

France
16 Oct 55

Lt Col John Spaulding USAF
Chief, Civil Branch, Community Relations Division
Office of Information

I would like to inform you about a recent observation made on 13 October 1955. If this does not interest you, please let me know, so as not to trouble you unnecessarily. Approximately a month ago I sent you an interesting file - an old observation pertaining to an unidentified object called a Flying saucer. Did you receive this material?

It was the 13th of October 1955. I was at Fontenay aux Roses, south of Paris. I casually looked up to the sky and my attention was drawn to an extremely bright star almost directly above Paris, somewhat east of it. (I.e. of course, difficult to evaluate the perpendicular of a thing that is at the high altitude). This seemed abnormal to me. It was still daylight, even though it was something like 18:21 o'clock. At the same spot, I was able to observe a long trail of white vapor thousands of meters in length. And a strong condensation, although perhaps not as white as the first. Within this condensation I observed numerous things, one of which appeared to be important [large]. (Sketch attached). It was of a reddish color. The appearance could have lasted no more than three minutes. Once the cloud of vapor had dispersed, nothing more was visible. Indicators, I think I witnessed the disintegration of a missile stage, because undoubtedly a satellite would not leave that large a trail. I only regret very much that I missed the moment "0" of this disintegration. I believe it was a stage of the USA [a USAF missile]. This seems to be confirmed by the fact that approximately 1 hour 8 minutes later, this 1958 [possibly 1962] very approximately passed from west to east, as it is often seen, and practically perpendicular to the preceding thing.

Unless I was under an illusion, could you tell me at what altitude this disintegration took place, that is, the movement of the object with the upper atmosphere?

Is it possible that nothing is left upon arrival on the ground because these certain losses are voluminous - does it volatilize [sic] in the air? [sense of sentence not clear...]


- page 8 -

So Far, neither the newspapers nor the radio have mentioned the fall of the object. I have not mentioned this observation either - it might be considered deranged.

Perhaps some of the residue was spread over the fields or woods and will be located one day without it then being possible to determine their origin.

Hoping that you are interested, I am attaching an approximate sketch.

Hope to hear from you,

Yours very truly,
[signed]

Please answer in French, if possible.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Soeaux, 16 October 1965

Monsieur John McAndling
Lt Colonel US AF
Chief, Allied Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information

Je me permets de vous faire part d'une observation s'etant de 13 octobre 1965 de la ville Soeaux. Je vous serais reconnaissant de me faire savoir, apres de ne faire sans autre part, je vous ai fait parvenir et un recit detaille interessant d'une operation aerienne concernant un objet non identifie. Je desire valable et utile, je vous prie de croire...

[The rest of the text becomes increasingly difficult to read with full confidence, so I have not transcribed it completely. The document appears to be a letter in French written on 16 October 1965, addressed to a US Air Force Lieutenant Colonel.]

Here is the OCR text from the document:

cul , c'est alors que mon attention se
porte sur une étoile extrêmement brillante
j'approche à la sortante de Paris mais plus à l'est
de cette ville. Il est d'ailleurs difficile avec la spatiale
d'établir le retrait d'une chose à haute altitude,
cela me paraissant anormal. il est encore jour
bien que le soleil est couchant, je pense un
moment à Vénus, puis mon attention est détournée
peut être demi en train seconde, je lève la
tête à nouveau pour apprécier ce mystère
l'étoile étant disparue, il était 19 h 42 -
à la même place je puis encore voir un
long panache de l'épaisseur d'un nuage représen-
tant des milliers de points en profondeur
et presque verticale bien qui monte vers
le nord - sur ce parcours de condensation
de nombreuses choses dont une paraissant
importante (dessin faisant) de couleur rougeâtre
j'observais. a puis être demi un même
minute - une fois le nuage
de vapeur simple, je ne distingue absolument
rien alors sur - je pense donc -

Note: This appears to be a handwritten document in French, and the OCR has captured the text as it appears on the page.
