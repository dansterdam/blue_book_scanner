Dear Sirs:

The following is the account of an object sighted at 17:00 (afternoon) while flying in October 1961.

[Several lines are blacked out/redacted]

A navigation light appeared in the horizon between Cano Island and Cocos Island (Costa Rica). 1957 lines looked about 20 miles long. The object (which could be called a "large ball") was at the guide a large yellowish light ball and a strong well-aimed of its path. It had a strong bright tail and a start. It took the object about three minutes from its appearance on the radar until it disappeared into the not-observed of the constellation. Its movement was unbelievable. Its motion to Northeast was at a resolved speed of...

Dear Binkley:

Will you see that the enclosed reaches proper authorities? I'm sure most Americans to read such a note but then I've never seen such a phenomena.

We were at the Club in Trujillo alongside Trujillo airfield. The Kitchen help allowed it an scale hardly filled preparing supper.

We all decided, because of the angle, that it was more than a craft from a star system. I have not heard of any UFO landing on this site.

So far what is to north, please send it on.

Closer, regards and have a good 1954.

25 January 1961

Honorable Lindley Beckworth
House of Representatives
Washington 25, D. C.

My dear Mr. Beckworth:

I have been requested to reply to your letter of 11 January which inquired about a sighting made on 20 October 1960. I have reviewed all material touching on launching from submarines that the U. S. Navy has conducted and I can report that no launching was made at that time. The closest launch in time was conducted several days before October 26th and at a different time of day. I am therefore certain that the sighting reported was not from a U. S. submarine. May I suggest that perhaps the U. S. Air Force or U. S. Army might have been conducting some activity at that time which might have been what was observed.

While we are not able to give confirmation to the sighting reported by Mr. [redacted], may I in all sincerity, would like to make about his letter. Seldom if ever have I seen such an explicitly spelled out, well documented report of a sighting. I was as a result most impressed and if we were fortunate enough to have all sightings as well planned and documented as this, it would be most helpful.

With the highest esteem,

Sincerely,

Honorable Mickey Donahue
House of Representatives
Dear Mr. [redacted]:

The Secretary of the Army has noted your inquiry in behalf of [redacted] concerning an observation from East Island, P. R. on 21 October 1961.

The Department of the Army has reviewed its missile and space activities on this date at its sightly and Fort no [illegible] activities together with the area. In brief, a local engineering, however, indicates that a small missile was fired from Cape Canaveral approximately five minutes prior to the reported time of sighting. It is this period which could have caused the phenomenon observed from East Island.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated. The enclosures are returned in the event you desire to enclose others in this regard.

Sincerely,

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location Puerto Rico - South Island, 18.1 So of Guayanilla, P.I.

Date 21 Oct 1960                   Hour (Z) Approx 2225*

WX Scattered clouds, vis 15 mi, winds SW & SE at 10 kts, 20 knots

Description Form: Size of case is athletic smaller than baseball, white.

Interval at tail seen from Ramey AFB than size of object. First seen at 10
deg else at 315 deg from Ramey - 45 deg elev 315 deg from South Tel - min'k
10 deg elev at 320 deg from azif. (see)

Direction of Motion Southeast, ascending

Satellite: (AFCIN-485, Phone 69219)     Noted out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) Noted out

Radar Analysis (ACIN-LRL)             None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.)

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.    Noted out

Other Unidentifiable

Evaluation of Source Reliability      Prob reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: All witness saw an estimated time of sighting.
Therefore it is possible that they saw the missile that was launched from
Cape Canaveral at several nights earlier. The trajectory taken by the object
is very close to that taken by missile. First learned the Ascension Island.
The duration of the sighting reported by some of the witnesses is 15 excess
of the burning time of the missile; however, the time was probably estimated,
therefore are very likely in error. Minimal to none in 3 and area duration.

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION, SAFIL
ATTENTION: Major Hartman

SUBJECT: Reference Your Case W80109

The following is a recommended reply to Congressman Beckworth regarding the sighting by His [redacted] of an unidentified flying object on 24 October 1960.

Dear Congressman Beckworth:

Since receiving your inquiry on behalf of Mr. [redacted], we have asked the Air Technical Intelligence Center to make a complete study of the information provided in order to identify the object His [redacted] observed on that evening.

ATC officials are quite certain that His [redacted] and the other individuals mentioned in this correspondence observed an Air Force Titan Intercontinental Ballistic Missile which was launched at 6:16 p.m., EST, that evening.

The ATC officials, incidentally, were able to reach this conclusion because of the detailed and relatively accurate data provided by your constituent.

In general, the direction, azimuth, color and [redacted] of the observation on the object reported by His [redacted] agrees with the data associated with the Air Force Titan which was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

If you have any additional questions regarding this, we would be most happy to hear from you further.

9. The following facts tend to substantiate this conclusion:
   a. The bearing from the location of the witnesses to Cape Canaveral is 312° magnetic. This coincides with the bearing to the object given by [redacted] indicates that the radar/displacement [partially illegible] and that the object was approximately 60° above the horizon at that time. At the time of the sighting this constellation was actually approximately [partially illegible]

10° above the horizon and at an azimuth of approximately 100°. The color associated with the rocket engine, a "clean" could in its orange with some red which could easily have been the color seen by the witnesses and described as yellow-red.

b. The general path of missiles fired from Cape Canaveral would carry them to the north of the location of the witnesses, a fact which is evident in this sighting.

c. The Titan firing from Cape Canaveral occurred at 23:36, and the sighting by the witnesses was reported to have occurred at 1939 hours Atlantic time (23:39). The burning time of the Titan engine is sufficient to have accounted for this small lapse in time.

4. Due to the availability of reliable data, it is believed that the conclusion in this case is 100% accurate.

[Several lines are partially or fully redacted]

In view of our interest, the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) was requested to make a comprehensive study of the object. Preliminary study at center to identify the object, its origin, and possible purpose was accomplished. Certain physical evidence was collected and studied. The other materials to which reference is made were carefully examined and analyzed.

The ATIC officials, incidentally, were able to make this conclusion because [partially redacted].

I hope the above information will be useful. If you can do anything further to assist you, please let me know.
