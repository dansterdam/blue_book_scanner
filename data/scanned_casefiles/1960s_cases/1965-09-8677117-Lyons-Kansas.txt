While in the official ward, out

Dear Mr. President,

I am very sorry to bother your but I am extremely concerned about what I saw in the sky last night.

Three, round, illuminated objects flew low over our community. I can assure you, Mr. President, that they, most certainly, were not airplanes. I can never, by any doubt, the existence of these objects. It is very disturbing to me that none seem to take these things seriously, until they have witnessed it for themselves.

Mr. President, I don't assume to tell you what you should or should not do, but I believe the nation and the world needs to know what we are seeing.

Please give me a reply.

Humbly and sincerely,
Mrs. [redacted]

Dear Sir:

The President has asked that I reply to your letter regarding unidentified flying objects.

The investigation of unidentified flying objects reported in your area, the United States is the responsibility of the Air Force. As the name of this project is Blue Book, I am enclosing a copy of the current report on this project.

In 15 years of investigating over 9000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proved almost conclusively that most reports can be explained either created and sent aloft by man, produced by atmospheric conditions, or caused by celestial bodies or the nature of meteoric activity.

The Air Force will continue to investigate all reports of unusual aerial phenomena over the United States. The evaluations and conclusions reached by the Air Force will be released to the public.

If you wish to report your sighting to the Air Force, you may do by completing the attached form as fully as possible and sending it to the following address:

[Address partially obscured]
Washington, D. C. 20330

Sincerely,

[Signature line is blank]
