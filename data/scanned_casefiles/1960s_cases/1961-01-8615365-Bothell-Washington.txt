Noting a -wing, object through the sink window, I placed a my watch and went quickly outside. The first hour was so to take this object moving very easily toward the west and filling as it moved. It had gone down and up again over the horizon in an over and over manner, such a tumbling, and another object burst with red glory very high in the sky and out of a cloud of white. It was too large and bright to be a star or planet. It was like a huge burning over and over in a tumbling, manner, first light, then dark that 12:25 and then 12:30. From this I looked at my watch again. In the cloud and it was all over 2 minutes had elapsed. 7:10 to 7:25 AM.

I hope I don't see anymore of these unidentified objects [remainder of text is obscured]

Dear Sir:

On December 19, 1950 a copy of a letter of mine addressed to Senator Jackson was sent to your office. My letter was in reference to an unidentified object which I sighted on the evening of November 30, 1950. I sent this report to Senator Jackson because I did not know to whom I should report.

Now I come again with a second report and we satisfied that I have the proper office to address.

Yesterday A.M. January 9, 1951, at the hour of 7:15, not quite light and not still dark, I was in my kitchen at my home north. On the northern sky a fast moving, star-like object of a burnt-orange hue appeared, moving in a westerly direction and very swiftly. I immediately realized this better and while it was not brilliant or of an awesome nature, it was not normal. Object continued on its course and disappeared over the trees on the horizon. Here now comes the surprising observation.

A second object burst high in the sky above this first and fast disappearing object. It too was an orange hue moving swiftly but it changed color as it appeared to be swirling or turning over as it moved. Over and over it went in a westerly direction and it too was gone behind the trees on the horizon. Again it burst large, large rocket.

I am not an advocate of flying saucers or strange space people, so I have to conclude that these last two objects are not out by human hands and are known to the military. I find myself mixed at seeing these two objects and feel that I must report this to your office. It could become a veritable nuisance to your office if I continue sending such phenomena.

Incidentally, the time involved that these two objects were visible was from 7:15 to 7:25.

It is interesting to note that I have seen these objects at flying when people are going to sail as well work and while as unlikely to notice the sky. My main aim will be to continue sending these observations that I have and might get again. I will just know anything that occurs in the future.

Very truly yours,
