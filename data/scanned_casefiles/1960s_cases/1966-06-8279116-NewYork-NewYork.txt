Dear Sirs:

I wish to report the following possible Interplanetary Phenomena seen last evening about 8:30 P.M., June 15 in New York City in the sky above Central Park around 52nd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues.

I was sitting on a north looking up, and so suddenly it was breath-taking. I saw a small OD, jet (dark in color) take a bit of a rose-live into a cloud and vanished. I also saw another, nor solid, appear again. Directly following it, a rather narrow long-cigar shaped trail of light. Time appeared to be about a horizontal direction for about one minute and a half, then that also disappeared and was not seen again.

My son saw the same thing, but by the time he ran for his camera, it had vanished.

There has not been more than the small dark object, clearly seen, nor its trail. I have told a couple of people. The light on fire trail made me wish to tell about it.

This is submitted for whatever interest it may add to various reports now are resulting from unseen sightings everywhere.

Yours very truly,

[Signature area blacked out]
