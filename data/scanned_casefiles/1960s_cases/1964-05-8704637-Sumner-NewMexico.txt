11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
This case was reported in March-April 1966. Since the actual sighting had occurred some time ago it is almost impossible to check it out. Also due to the time lag the pertinent data has probably become distorted. Therefore this case is considered Information Only.

Here is the text from the document:

8. The estimate of times, angles, and speeds places the lights about 10,000 feet in the air moving at 130 mph. Is there any reason to think they could not have been, say, at 50,000 feet moving at 650 mph?

9. What was the sky condition? Was the moon out?

Finally, a few questions relating to the witnesses:

1. Where were you and who was with you at the time of the sighting?

2. Have you since heard of anyone else who saw the same things?

3. Have you seen anything similar since the original sighting?

It is probably true that the above questions have left out items which you may consider important; that is why you are being asked, not to fill out a standard report form again, but to relate the events in your own words and in your own way, using the questions as a guide.

I assure you that reports will be treated seriously; on the TMX report I have here, there is the notation, "Witnesses to the sightings appeared to be reliable." There is also the concluding comment, "The sightings are presently unexplainable."

One of the commonest experiences of people who have actually seen a UFO is that they find, on talking to others, that a surprising number of people will suddenly admit to having seen themselves, or to knowing someone who has. While many of these sightings are quite old by the time the witness is moved to reveal them to someone who will not think he is crazy, it is still of statistical interest to us to obtain information about them. If any of you can help an experience like this, we would greatly appreciate you giving the person or persons the return address on this letter and asking them if they would mind sending us a full description of their sightings. We must rely on responsible members of the public to help us in matters of this kind, as we simply have neither the personnel nor the budget to carry on this kind of data-gathering ourselves.

I hope that all the six witnesses who receive this letter (pardon the strange salutation "Dear Witnesses," but that's the only way I could think of to address six people) will take the time to write individual responses; nothing can surpass several independent, made-out reports for reliability and a complete coverage of details. Each respondent will receive a brief report on their conclusions ("guesses", if you prefer) after we have had a chance to evaluate the full reports.

I should mention that this letter is part of the official Air Force investigation, and that Dr. Hynek, for whom I am writing this letter, is a scientific consultant to the Air Force on UFO investigations.

Sincerely yours,

First Sighting - Questions Answered in Order

1. Sketch attached.

2. All lights involved seemed to shine from their own source. The "cabin" or "gondola" lights were normal for room or cabin lighting. No noise whatsoever - either piston or jet. Height seemed to be 800 to 1,000 feet.

3. The "landing" lights (2) appeared as a distant auto headlight except much brighter.

4. The brightness of a landing light except it projected no beam.

5. As if seen through a haze due to the brightness of the lights involved and a bright street light nearby. The object appeared to have delta wing construction but not clearly outlined.

6. Refer to sketch - windows were definitely outlined as shown.

7. Traveling in a straight line (northerly) about 50 to 80 MPH. No spinning or rotating could be seen.

8. Due to the fact that it made absolutely no noise, also at the low altitude and with both commercial and Air Force airports close by, it had no high intensity red rotating lights on nor did it have any running lights at all. In all normal type of aircraft that I am familiar with, the cockpit lights would be off so that the pilot may see plus the fact all cockpit windshields are normally on the top side of the (known) aircraft, this particular craft was beneath as it would be on a blimp or a larger type lighter-than-aircraft.

9. As stated in Answer #4, no beams were projected from any of the lights. I have hardly ever been at a night so clear that some projections would be noticed, but there were none on this sighting. I did not notice any illumination on the ground or surrounding houses and it was directly overhead.

10. Slowly, in a northerly direction. After it passed over and I was looking at it from the rear - only the "landing" lights could be seen as apparently the "cabin windows" were only on the end in the direction in which it was heading. As it headed northward, a plane was observed coming towards us at eleven o'clock high (4 to 5 thousand feet) with the normal complement of running lights. The engine (piston) of this plane could easily be heard.

11. I do not believe it was any type of aircraft normally used by any country on this planet.

First Sighting: Question #1

The windows and "landing lights" looking from beneath appeared like the sketch below. Nothing was seen in the windows which were softly lighted. The round lights were very bright and prevented seeing the main body except as shaded.

[A simple sketch is included showing a curved object with two round circles on either side, resembling a UFO or flying saucer-like shape]

Second Sighting - Questions Answered in Order

1. See attached sketch. As the lights proceeded on a southerly course (again no sound at all), object No. 2 in sketch peeled off towards the east and seemed to lose altitude and went "out" all at once. The rest of them just disappeared in the same direction which should have taken them almost over the Air Force Base located there.

2. Very bright bluish-white.

3. They moved as though in formation approximately 4,000 ft. high.

4. About the same intensity except for the bluish color.

5. They were similar except much larger.

6. Answered in #1.

7. No beam, just a light bulb except much brighter.

8. Due to the comparison with the horizon and the angle that I saw them, I would say they were 4 to 5 thousand feet high moving at 350 - 400 MPH.

9. Conditions were clear - the moon was not visible to me at the time.

Final Questions Asked

1. I was with my son [redacted] at the time. We also were talking to his neighbors who saw the object before we did. They were an Air Force Sergeant and his Mother.

2. My son says he has heard and talked to several who saw the same thing.

3. No.

Being a private pilot myself and having seen other UFO's several years ago, I usually watch the sky for any unusual objects. I had a very good view of the objects in question, was not excited and with the first object had a good chance to try to evaluate it as it flew over. I know of nothing on this planet that flies without any noise except a glider and this flight could not be duplicated with a glider especially at night. A blimp could be drifting along - but it would have its proper lights on - plus the fact that Air Force would know it was there. I also believe from what "good" facts I have read and what I myself have seen over the past years, that these objects are from other planet. The only thing that I can't understand is if they are that far advanced - what are they waiting for? They most certainly are not afraid of us and should land and make themselves known.

I am not worried about what people think, as they thought Fulton was a nut, but the steamboat did not do too bad. We also have a few objects in space that may puzzle the same ones who puzzle us???

EIRE
Strange objects over Dublin
From the Dublin Evening Herald of
May 6:
"It was bright, silent and travelling low at a great speed from West
to East"

This was a report left on the pad
of Raheny Garda station today
about a mysterious object which
passed over the area at 4.30 a.m. The
object was described as "like a flying
saucer", but no further details were
given. It was not seen from the control tower at Dublin airport, and Dunsink
Observatory said it was probably
a small meteorite."

OBJECT SEEN IN NEW JERSEY

Hillsborough, New Jersey, May 7 - Douglas DeCicci of Meadowbrook, reported a UFO at around 1:30 a.m., when glancing out of his car window.

He had parked his car in the driveway upon returning home, and was preparing to leave the vehicle, when he noticed a luminous object at an altitude of about 100 feet, moving gently towards him. A slight vacillation was described.

The UFO was of a spherical shape and glowed with a soft blue light. It was estimated to be about six feet in diameter, with a ruby red "light blinking at its base. There were no visible protuberances, vents, or jets.

The object came to a halt about 30 feet from DeCicci's car, directly above the roof of a sleeping neighbor's home. It was motionless for about 20 seconds, the ruby red light still blinking.

DeCicci had, by now, left his car, and entered his home to awaken his wife to inform her of the strange object outside. She accompanied him to their yard and reported the object disappearing with great speed.

Western Sightings
Spring '64 Flap

Several sightings which took place in the west during the Spring of 1964 UFO activity, were crowded out of all bulletins by more detailed accounts of other incidents. We take this opportunity to list these incidents with pertinent details:

Mrs. G. L. Kriger, of 8, New Mexico, Highway 10, Tijeras, reported to authorities and the Albuquerque Tribune that

details of the events were speedy mystery objects. Mrs. J. M. Watkins of Summit Ridge (north of Cortes, Colorado) told a reporter that she saw 2 cylindrical-shaped objects with fins flying at about 200 feet altitude. They appeared to be about 50 feet long. A neighbor also viewed the objects.

A similar report came from a Mancos, Colorado man who said he saw two objects (description correlates with object seen by Mrs. Watkins) flying in the vicinity of Mesa Verde National Park. Same date.

Later in the afternoon a report was made to the Federal Aviation Agency at Farmington, New Mexico of a cylindrical object flying in the area. This report and another made at Farmington a short time later said the object appeared to be "tumbling in the air" as it flew at low altitude.

Two Albuquerque men who refused to identify themselves in print told the Albuquerque Tribune that they watched a small, flat-bottomed egg-shaped object for about 5 minutes through binoculars at 1:40 p.m. on 11 May. It was metallic-appearing, noiseless and flew near the base of the Manzano Mountains. They first thought the object was a jet but it was flying too slow. It disappeared after 5 minutes, then a jet flew over. They had no trouble identifying the jet and said the object definitely was not a conventional aircraft. The Manzano Mountains, incidentally, are a highly sensitive classified military area.

We first heard a noise over
head and I said that sounds
like bullets at high altitude
the sound did not last over
three seconds. we heard
them three times at about
five minutes intervals.
but by the time we looked
up they were out of site,
so my wife bayed on her
back to look up, and
and she soon said there
goes four bright objects and
by the time I looked up they
were gone, but then we
heard them.

We could not imagine why
we could hear them at such
high altitude, unless it was

Three young children claim that another landing occurred at 11 a.m. on May 9th near Mogadore, Ohio. They described the craft as round and silvery, with a dome. The saucer, seen at a distance of about 150 yards, was 10 feet in diameter, according to the children.

11, 12 May 64
Grangeville, Idaho

Grangeville, Idaho residents watched an oblong-shaped object which appeared to hover near the Cottonwood Air Force radar installation on the nights of May 11 and 12, 1964, from 9:30 to 11:15 p.m. Sheriff James Fuzzell and others watched the object through binoculars as it moved "back and forth" on a horizontal plane.

Colonel Luis Zendeguy, Station Commander at the Radar station, said several of his men reported sighting a bright object. "Whether it was a star or what I don't know and neither do they. We are buffaloed. I have forwarded our report to higher headquarters," he told newsmen.

The object was in the north from the Grangeville and appeared over the radar site, ruling out a star as an explanation. The object made no noise, appeared on two consecutive nights at the same time and was not seen again.

Rio Vista, California
13 May 1964

On the night of May 13th, many persons in Rio Vista, California, saw a UFO touch down near the local airport. Scorched earth was found at the spot, which was subsequently visited by crowds of curious residents. According to one witness, the UFO was "in the shape of a banana", flattened and thin, and was bending fire streaks along its underside. It had two white lights, and touched the ground before taking off in a red haze at great speed. By the time the local newspaper printed the story, someone had covered the charred area with canvas. A Rio Vista police squad as well as Air Force officers reportedly investigated the incident, but as usual, no conclusions were given to the public.

Air Ministry excels itself
From the Boeing Standard, May 13:
"Air Ministry officials are baffled by reports of an 'unearthly' flying object which several people have seen high in the sky over Bedfordshire during the night. One eye-witness, taxi driver Mr. John Hodges, of Turners Road, Luton, said: 'It looks like a car headlamp in the sky, sometimes hovering and sometimes moving. I have seen it fade and come on again and I have seen beams of light radiating from it.'

"Mr. Hodges said it could not be a star, because it is much too big. It could also not be a satellite, since it stays still for long periods. Mr. Jack Foreman, of Hayhurst Road, Luton, has also seen the mystery object.

"It was definitely something out of the ordinary," he declared. "I used to be in the R.A.F. and I know this thing was definitely not an aircraft."

Yet another witness, Mr. William Hughes, of Abbey Drive, Luton, said: "As I watched it, the thing began to move like a pendulum with a gentle swinging motion."

"An Air Ministry official said he was unable to give any explanation. "'It might be a weather balloon with lights on—or it might even be the planet Venus, which does sometimes move in an extraordinary manner,' he said.

VERY CLOSE SIGHTING IN NEW JERSEY: According to a news report dated May 14th, a Meadowbrook, N. J. barber named Douglas DeCicco made an unusually detailed sighting of a 'flying saucer' while on his way home at 1:30 that morning. According to the newspaper account, DeCicco first saw the object while parking his car in the driveway of his home, but in a subsequent telephone interview with Boston radio station WBZ, he said that the UFO followed him part of the way home from a bowling alley he had just left. In either case, the startling part of the story is that DeCicco saw the object move slowly toward him at an altitude of only about 100 feet above the driveway. It was spherical in shape and glowed with a soft blue light, according to the witness. It appeared to be about six feet in diameter, and had a ruby red blinking light in its base. There were no windows, nor were there any vents, jets, or other protrusions of any kind. The UFO finally came to a slow stop about 30 feet away from his car, right over the roof of a sleeping neighbor's home. It stood absolutely motionless for about 20 seconds, during which time the ruby red light kept blinking. A minute or so later the thing "took off in a hurry," just as DeCicco was summoning his wife to see it.

UFO LANDINGS IN OHIO: At about 11:50 on the night of May 15th, a California motorist named Bill Mitchell reported seeing a flying saucer on the ground just a few yards from Interstate Route 90, near the town of Geneva, Ohio. The man, who told his story by telephone to the Ohio State Highway Patrol, said that the object was sitting in the bushes on the south side of the eastbound traffic lane. The UFO was the size of a large trailer truck, and changed color while he watched. It hovered for a moment about eight feet off the ground and then soared to a height of 300 to 400 feet. Finally, it zoomed away and disappeared into the night sky. The motorist claimed that the driver of a trailer truck also saw the object, and that both vehicles stopped to investigate. The call to the police was made from a nearby pay telephone.

Geneva, Ohio

That same night (May 15, 1964), at 11:51 P.M., EST, a trucker and a motorist reported seeing a huge object rise from alongside IS Rte. 90, near Geneva, Ohio. It hovered, changing to a brilliant orange, over the roadway, then shot upward and disappeared. The startled observers notified the Ohio State Patrol Office in Ashtabula. Plt. Gary Betzler went to the scene and made a thorough search for radioactivity - and found it, near a small man-made lake.

In the Akron area, unpublicized sightings which were nevertheless promptly reported, were made that same May 15th night. Two observers saw two very slow-moving objects moving N-S in the clear western sky. At the moment when they were coming invisible, one of them increased tremendously in white brilliance which lasted a full minute. Then it dimmed quickly into invisibility. Seen for 11 minutes - time: 10:40-10:51 EDST.

Flying Object
Zoomed A
Patrol Told

ASHTABULA, O., May 16 —
The State highway patrol today was investigating reports that an unidentified flying object was seen last night seven miles east of Ashtabula.

The patrol said a motorist, George Beach, Calif., and a truck driver reported seeing the object shortly before midnight as they were driving on Interstate 90.

THE ORANGE-colored object about the size of a tractor-trailer was on the ground when first spotted and, then it zoomed, the patrol said. It was, the patrol said, a "mysterious" driver asked that their identity not be disclosed.

A patrolman who also saw the hot be identified by name said he was sent to the area with a geiger counter and radio active readings were obtained, but it was not established that the reading resulted from the flying object.

"You also can go to the patrol barracks and get more details," the patrolman said.

Ashtabula, Ohio . . . The object seen near 1.8. 90 on May 15th was estimated to be 65 feet long (or diameter). A gas station attendant saw a great flash of light at the same time. A boy whose home has a clear view of the area said he saw the object but was restrained from answering questions. An amateur astronomer and his son, driving on Rte 20, saw an unusual object. A person known to the editor had a good look at the object.

Pti. Betzler checked for background radiation before finding a small area where the number counts were suddenly mounted and steadily sounded away.

He backed away in a large arc, the counts reducing to ordinary low background intensity, but upon reaching the "hot spot", the counts would suddenly rise as before noted. He repeated this procedure several times with the same result.

The corrected time when the object was seen: 2352 EST or 0052 EDST. (12:52 A.M.) More in the next FSIC Bulletin.

Gentlemen:

We have read and heard in the news about flying objects being seen lately! The one we especially noted were the four white objects seen at high altitude by a commercial pilot from Los Vegas, Nevada. They seem to be identical to what my wife and I heard and she saw them looking straight up, just after sun-up on May 2nd 1964 while we were fishing at Elephant Gods Lake near Ft. Sumner, New Mexico.

Here is the text from the document:

Received it was such a
Clear quiet morning.
They were traveling in a
west ward direction.

We always wondered what
they could have been
But did not know where
to write to until we saw
the address in the paper
Hope you can give us an
explanation.

Yours truly,

Mentor, Ohio
3 May 1964

OHIO POLICEMEN REPORT UFO

Mentor, Ohio, May 3 - A bright UFO was reportedly seen over Lake Erie from Mentor. Witnesses included John D. Hadden, Lake County deputy-sheriff, and Managers of Mentor Park, and 2 Mentor policemen, who have, fearing ridicule, declined to give their names.

Hadden first saw the object in the east, travelling slowly in a north to south direction. The UFO then halted and hovered for an estimated five minutes. All of a sudden, it appeared to expand or come nearer in its approach, and, after about one minute, once again diminished to its former size.

The UFO then shot away southward at an extremely high velocity. The object passed behind the tree tops and then emerged into the clear, describing a curving path which ended abruptly in less than 10 seconds.

The object was described by Hadden as circular, a yellowish white in color, with a soft glow.

A woman near Painesville, a town near Mentor, reportedly observed an object in the north at around the same time. Shortly thereafter, Patrolman Don Janz viewed the object in the south from Mentor. On The Lake.

The craft was judged to be similar in size to an 11" object held edge to edge at arm's length.

HARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201
-- November 1964

[Redacted Address]
Pitzer, New Jersey

Dear Witnesses:

This letter is a follow-up to a report made by Mr. [Redacted] Sr. to the U. S. Air Force on 8 May 1964, in connection with an unidentified flying object sighted on 7 May 1964. We have begun a new program aimed at clarifying reports in the files on which investigators were not able to reach a satisfactory conclusion; that is the principal reason that this inquiry comes so long after your report was made.

As is often the case, the final material filed on the basis of your UFO report contains very little information that would help a person going through the files understand why the object was reported to the Air Force. By the time you report reached my hands, the following information was approximately all that was left:

The first object was shaped like a blimp; venicula; the second looked like a diamond. One object seen first, five seen second time. Four to five windows in "blimp gondola," also what looked like landing light shining straight down. One witness saw swept-back wings like a jet. Second sighting consisted of large bright center light and four smaller lights in diamond formation.

There follows information on estimated speeds and ground track.

You can see that anyone re-reading the report would get very little of the original incident out of it, and that is what we are trying to correct. The purpose of this letter is to ask you for a re-statement of its sighting, so that we can have on hand something against which to compare other similar reports. One reason for particular interest in more information is that there have been reports of two objects, each resembling to some extent one or the other of the objects reported by you. A clearer description of what you saw would help me and others working on this problem to make comparisons.

I am going to indicate some points we need to have cleared up, and ask a number of questions: feel free to answer in any way you please, the best way being simply to write as clear and complete a report as you can, referring to the questions to make sure you have talked about all we need to know.


- page 30 -

Let us take the two objects one at a time. First, the "blimp gondola."

1. Can you make a sketch of it?

2. Did it shine with its own light, or did there appear to be some other source of light illuminating it?

3. The "landing light" was reported as shining straight down; did the source of light appear to have a large diameter, like a searchlight, or a small diameter, like a distant automobile headlight?

4. Did the "landing light" seem to be of a brightness normal for an aircraft landing light? What about its color?

5. Was the object itself clearly outlined all the way around, or was it seen as through a haze?

6. Could the shape of the "four or five windows" be seen? - What made them look like windows instead of, for example, lights mounted on the object?

7. Did the object appear to be spinning or rotating, or was it travelling in a straight line? How was it oriented?

8. Clearly, the witnesses are familiar with the appearance of airplanes: how did this object differ from an aircraft, that made you think it was definitely not a familiar object?

9. Did the light illuminate the ground, surrounding trees, or houses?

10. How did the object disappear - suddenly or slowly?

11. Have you had any thoughts on what it might have been?

Now to the second sighting. There is less information available on this one, so it appears that the primary information to be developed further concerns the duration in which the lights were seen and the relationship in brightness and color.

1. Can you sketch the formation? Did it change?

2. What were the colors of the lights?

3. Did the lights move as if they were all attached to the same object or invisible framework, or did they move relative to one another?

4. How bright were the lights in comparison with the first object?

5. How bright were the lights in comparison with bright stars, or Jupiter (in the eastern skies right after sunset this fall)?

6. Was the light which veered off one of the four that had been in diamond formation, or was it a completely new light?

7. Were the lights bright enough to show a shape, or were they just points of light?
