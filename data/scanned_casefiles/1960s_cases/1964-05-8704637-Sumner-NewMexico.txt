Unfortunately, there is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the output of the text found in the document:

8. The estimate of times, angles, and speeds places the lights about 10,000 feet in the air moving at 130 mph; is there any reason to think they could not have been, say, at 50,000 feet moving at 620 mph?

9. What was the sky condition? Was the moon out?

Finally, a few questions relating to the witnesses:

1. Where were you and who was with you at the time of the sighting?

2. Have you since heard of anyone else who saw the same things?

3. Have you seen anything similar since the original sighting?

It is probably true that the above questions have left out items which you may consider important; that is why you are being asked, not to fill out a standard form again, but to relate the events in your own words, using the questions as a guide.

I should explain that your report will be treated seriously; on the TWX report I have here, there is the notation, "Witnesses to the sightings appeared to be reliable." There is also the concluding comment, "The sightings are presently unexplainable."

The commonest experiences of people who have actually seen a UFO is that it is only seen for a few seconds. This is also our experience. While many of these sightings are quite old by the time the witness has revealed them to someone who will note them down, it is still of statistical interest to us to obtain information about them. If any of you would mention your return address on this letter and asking them to call upon you, we would greatly appreciate you giving the same; we must say that we are responsible members of the public to help us in matters of this national importance. But there is no necessity to do so if you do not wish to divulge your identity.

I hope that all the six witnesses who receive this letter (pardon the strange salutation "Dear Witnesses," but that's the only way I could think of to address six people) will take the time to write the detailed responses not because we surpass several independently-made-out reports for reliability and completeness of details. Each response will receive a reply report on our evaluation after we have had a chance to evaluate the full reports.

I should mention that this letter is part of the official Air Force investigation, and that Dr. Hynek, for whom I am writing this letter, is a scientific consultant to the Air Force on UFO investigations.

Sincerely yours,

First Sighting - Questions Answered in Order

1. Sketch attached.
2. All lights involved seemed to shine from their own source. The "cabin or gondola" lights were almost normal in intensity. The noise whatsoever - either piston or jet. Height seemed to be 3000 to 5000 feet.
3. The "landing" lights (2) appeared as a distant auto headlight except much brighter.
4. The brightness of a landing light except it projected no beam.
5. As if seen through a haze due to the brightness of the lights involved and a bright street light nearby. The object appeared to have delta wing construction but not clearly outlined.
6. Refer to sketch - windows were definitely outlined as shown.
7. Traveling in a straight line (northerly) about 50 to 80 MPH. No spinning or erratic course should be presumed.
8. Due to the fact that it made absolutely no noise, also at the low altitude and with no commercial air traffic airports close by, it had no high intensity red rotating lights as nor did I have any running lights at all. In all normal type or aircraft that I am familiar with the cockpit lights would be off so that the pilot may see the dash and controls ordinarily on one.
9. As stated in Answer #4, no beams were projected from any of the lights. I have partially seen similar sights before but conditions would be noted, but there were none on this sighting. No indications any illumination on the ground or surrounding houses and it was directly overhead.
10. Slowly, in a northeasterly direction. After it passed over and I was looking at it from the rear - I only the "landing" lights could be seen as apparently the rest of the windows were only on the end in the direction in which it was heading. As it headed northward, 5 plane (4 to 5 inch)(and test) with the normal compliment of running lights. The engine (piston) of this plane could easily be heard.
11. I do not believe it was any type of aircraft normally used by any country on this planet.

The text above the sketch states "First Sighting: Question #1" and describes the "windows and 'landing lights' looking from beneath appeared like the sleek below. Nothing was seen in the windows which were softly lighted. The round lights were very bright and prevented seeing the main body except as blurred."

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed document, likely a Project Blue Book report, discussing a UFO sighting.

Second Sighting - Questions Answered in Order

1. See attached sketch. As the lights proceeded on a southerly course (again no sound at all), object No. 2 in sketch peeled off towards the east and seemed to descend and went behind a building in which I would have taken them almost over the Air Force Base located there.
2. Very bright bluish-white.
3. They moved as though in formation approximately 4,000 ft. high.
4. About the same intensity except for the bluish color.
5. They were similar except much larger.
6. Answered in #1.
7. No beam, just as a light bulb except much brighter.
8. Due to the comparison with the horizon and the angle that I saw them, I would say they were 5 thousand feet high moving at 350 MPH.
9. Conditions were clear - the moon was not visible to me at the time.

Final Questions Asked:
1. I was with my son-in-law at the time. We also were talking to his neighbors who saw the object before we did. They were an Air Force Sergeant and his Mother.
2. My son says he has heard and talked to several who saw the same thing.
3. Being a private pilot myself and having seen other UFO's several years ago, I probably watch the skies for any phenomena. I had a clear view of the objects in question, was not excited and with the first object could not be duplicated with a flare or anything else I know of. But the third object may have been a plane that could not be duplicated with a flare in the air especially at night. A blimp could not do this. The question remains what were these objects? Also, I believe from what I have read and what I myself have seen over the past years that these objects are from some other planet. The only thing is that I can't understand is that they made no sound. Why??? I am not worried about what people think, as they thought Fulton was a nut, but the steamboat did not do too bad. We also have a few objects in space that may puzzle the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the same ones who puzzled the

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a report or document about a "box-like object" observed in the sky over Pretoria, South Africa on May 6. The text describes the sighting in detail, including the object's appearance, movement, and the observations made by multiple witnesses. The report states that this sighting was received by various sources and that technicians at the Hartbeeshoek space station near Pretoria do not know what the object is.

SOURCE PAPER: SAUCERS 
Jul-Aug, Volume 10, No. 4
Pretoria, South Africa

Box-like object The Pretoria News of May 6

"A mysterious glowing flying object which has been puzzling residents for the past three weeks, made another appearance over the city last night. This time, powerful binoculars were trained on the object, and residents of Chamberlain Street, Moreletapark, saw that it took the form of a box-like structure surrounded by an orange glow. The object was in view for about 20 minutes, from about 7:30 p.m. to 7:50 p.m. Mrs. J. P. J. van Rensburg and her neighbors saw the object switch from a sub-visual direction to the north-east, where it disappeared from the horizon. 'We saw it stop and then continue,' said Mrs. Van Rensburg, immediately telephoning the Radcliffe Observatory and, although they scanned the sky, they could not locate the object because it may have been a meteorological experiment we also confirmed one day,' the Radcliffe Observatory said. They did not see it, Mrs. Van Rensburg said. Mr. N. R. Hansen, of 482 Frederick Street, West End, saw an orange glowing object at 5:20 in the morning. It rose from the horizon in the north, and then veered eastwards.  Mr. Hansen said: 'The object was visible for some minutes and then disappeared only to reappear soon after. It was definitely not a shooting star.' Several other reports about the object have been received at various times. Technicians at the Hartbeeshoek space station, near Pretoria, do not know what it is!

OBJECT SEEN IN NEW JERSEY
Douglass DeCicco of Meadowbrook, reported a UFO at around 1:30 a.m. when glancing out of his car window. He had parked his car in the driveway upon returning home and was preparing to leave the vehicle, when he noticed a luminous object at an altitude of about 100 feet, hovering gently towards him. A slight rocking motion was observed.
The UFO was of a spherical shape and glowed with a soft blue light. It was estimated to be about 15 feet in diameter. As DeCicco watched, the object seemed to increase in brightness and then suddenly disappeared, leaving no visible protuberances, vents, or jets.
The object came to a halt about 30 feet from DeCicco's car, directly above the roof of a sleeping neighbor's home. It was motionless for about 20 seconds, the only sound being a slight humming. DeCicco had, by now, left his car, and entered his home and alerted his wife. She accompanied him to their yard and reported she observed the object disappearing with great speed.

WESTERN SIGHTINGS
Spring '64 Play
Several sightings which took place in the west during the Spring of 1964 UFO activity, were crowded out of fall bulletins by more detailed accounts of other incidents. We take this opportunity to list these incidents with pertinent details:

MRS. G. L. KRIGER, of S. New Mexico, Highway 10, Tularosa, reported to authorities and the Albuquerque Tribune that she and New Mexico reported speedy mystery objects. Mrs. J. M. Watkins of Sumner, New Mexico, told a reporter that she saw 2 cylindrical-shaped objects with fins flying at about 300 feet altitude. They appeared to be about 50 feet long. A neighbor also observed the objects.

A similar report came from a Mancos, Colorado man who said he saw two objects (description correlates with object seen by Mrs. Watkins) flying in the Estes Vedas National Park. Same date.

Later in the afternoon a report was made to the Federal Aviation Agency at Farmington, New Mexico of a cylindrical object sighted near there, and another made at Farmington a short time later said the object appeared to be "tumbling in the air" as it flew at low altitude.

Two Albuquerque men who refused to identify themselves in print watched the Albuquerque Tribune that they watched a small, flat-bottomed egg-shaped object for about 5 minutes through binoculars on 11 May. It was metallic appearing, noiseless and flew near the base of the Manzano Mountains. They first thought the object was a jet but it was flying too slow. It disappeared after 3 or 4 minutes, then a jet flew over. They had no trouble identifying the jet and said the object definitely was not a conventional aircraft. This area, incidentally, is a highly sensitive classified military area.

The first heard a noise over heard and I said that sound like deafats at high altitude. The sound died not last over these seconds not heard them three times at about five minutes interval. but by the time we looked up they were not in site. so we could not get a good look at them. we heard them back to look up and not see anything. The could not imagine why we could hear them at such a high altitude, unless it was some form lightweight craft.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Grangeville, Idaho residents watched an oblong-shaped object which appeared to hover near the Cottonwood Air Force Radar Installation on the nights of May 10-11, 1964 from 9:30 to 11:15 p.m. Sheriff James Puzell and others watched the object through binoculars as it moved "back and forth" on a horizontal plane. Colonel Luis Zandriel, Station Commander, at the Radar station, said several of his men reported sighting a bright object. "I don't know and neither do they. We are buffaloed. I have forwarded our report to higher headquarters," he told newsmen.

The object was in the north from Grangeville and appeared to disappear on the radar, blinking out a star as an explanation. The object made no noise, appeared on two consecutive nights at the same time and was not seen again.

Sussex, England

From the "Major Night Observer of May 12": a "brilliantly coloured" unidentified object was sighted by three guests in the evening (May 12) hovering in clouds in the Ditchling area. The object "seemed to be moving very slowly and seemed to be very bright and defined and it seemed to grow dimly brighter and dimmer". The witness said "I would have recognized an aircraft and I have seen a satellite which was much smaller twice the size of the evening star and much brighter."

A spokesman at R.A.F. Tangmere said no unidentified objects had been reported.

On the night of May 13th, many persons in Rio Vista, California, saw a UFO touch down near the local airport. Scorched earth was found at the spot where the object landed. According to one witness, the UFO was "in the shape of a banana". Several residents attended and then. The object took off at a high rate of speed. Some time later the local newspaper printed the story. A Rio Vista police squad car was with canvas as witnessed Air Force officers reportedly investigated the incident, but as usual, no conclusions were given to the public.

AIR MINISTRY EXCELS ITSELF
"For the 6-wing Standard, May 13, Air Ministry officials are 'baffle? reports of an 'unearthly' flying object which several people have seen high in the sky over Bedfordshire during the night. One eye-witness, taxi driver Mr. John Hodge, of Luton, said: 'It looks like a luminous object, sometimes hovering and sometimes moving - it gave off beams of light radiating from it.' 
'Mr. Hodge said it could not be a planet. 'It could also not be a satellite, since it stays still for long periods,' he said.
Mr. Jack Hughes, of Abbey Drive, Luton, said: 'As I watched it, the thing began to swing in a pendulum-like swinging motion.'
'An Air Ministry official said he was unable to give any explanation. 
'It might be a weather balloon with lights on - or it might even be with the planet Venus, which does sometimes move in an extraordinary manner,' he said.

VERY CLOSE SIGHT-
ING IN NEW JERSEY:  According to a news report dated May 14th, a Meadowbrook, N.J. resident named DeCicco made an unusually detailed sighting of a "flying saucer" while on his way home at 1:30 that morning.  According to the newspaper account, DeCicco first saw the object while driving away from his home, but in a subsequent telephone interview, he said the UFO followed him part of the way home from a bowling alley he had just left.  In either case, the object moved slowly toward him at an altitude of only about 100 feet above the driveway.  It was spherical and glowed with a soft blue light, according to the witness.  It appeared to be about six feet in diameter, and had a ruby red blinking light in its base.  There were no windows nor did it make any sounds.  After passing over his car, it moved off in a northerly direction from his car, finally fading from sight.  A minute or so later the thing "took off in a hurry," just as DeCicco was summoning his wife to see it.

Text from the document:

UFO LANDINGS IN OHIO: At about 11:50 on the night of May 15th, a California motorist named Bill Mitchell reported seeing a "flying saucer" on the ground near the town of Geneva, Ohio. The man, who told his story by telephone to the Ohio State Highway Patrol, said that the object was sighted in the eastbound traffic lanes. The UFO was hovering and its color ranged from colored to white. It was observed for a moment, about eight feet off the ground, and then it suddenly accelerated and disappeared into the night sky. The motorist claimed that the driver of the vehicle also saw the object, and that both vehicles stopped to investigate. The call to the police was made from a nearby pay telephone.

That same night (May 15, 1964) at 11:51 P.M. EST, a pilot and copilot of a commercial airliner, reported seeing a huge object rise from alongside 15 Rt. 150, near Greenfield, Ohio. It hovered, then shot upward and disappeared and these sightings were reported to the Civil Aeronautics Office in Ashbabule. Pix Gary Setzer went to the scene and made a thorough search and radiatively - and found it, near a small ditch.

In the Akron area, unpublished sightings which were never-theless popularly reported were made that same May 13th night.
These observers saw two, slow-moving objects-moving very slowly in the clear western sky. At the moment when they were becoming invisible, one of them increased tremendously in white brilliance. Then it dimmed quickly into invisibility. Seen for 11 minutes - time: 10:40-10:51 EDST.

The image appears to contain a newspaper clipping with the headline "Flying Object Zoomed Away Patrol Told". The text describes a reported incident where a "flying object" was seen by a patrol near Ashtabula, Ohio on May 18. The object was described as "racing across the sky" and then "zoomed away" before the patrol could get a closer look.

As requested, here is the text from the document:

FLYING OBJECT ZOOMED AWAY PATROL TOLD
ASHTABULA, O., MAY 18 - The State Highway Patrol said it was investigating reports that an unidentified flying object was sighted by a patrol car west of Ashtabula. The report said a motorist also reported seeing the object about 12:15 a.m. Monday over Long Beach, Calif., and a taxicab driver reported seeing the object just before midnight on Interstate 90 west of Ashtabula. The object, the report said, was of a tractor-trailer size, was on the ground when first sighted, and then it "zoomed away." The patrol said it was unable to establish identity of the object.

Dear Sirs:

This is to send and forward a report about an object being seen quite differently from the one we especially noted here at this point. The object was at a high altitude by a commercial pilot from Los Mochis, Morelia, Mexico. They seem to be a skilled lot and I heard and saw them looking straight up and examining it quite brilliantly. 

After some inquiry, I find that April 1st, 1964, at Albuquerque, Las Cruses are checking on this while here and that there were a number watching this. I heard and saw them looking straight up and examining it quite brilliantly. 

First after sighting on April 1, 1964, while we were fishing at Lake - mean Almogordo Lake, they also have checking on this.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document from Project Blue Book, an American government study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

"Respected and such a clear quiet morning.
They were travelling in a northeast ward direction.
The always described sighted the best did not have been
Bell did not know where to write to write the address
the address in the paper hope you can give me an
explanation."

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report titled "OHIO POLICEMEN REPORT UFO" that describes an incident that occurred on May 3, 1964 near Lake Erie, Ohio. The report was filed by a witness who was a UFO reporter from Mentor, Ohio. The report describes an unidentified object that was sighted over Lake Erie and witnessed by a Lake County deputy sheriff and a manager of a Mentor police department. The object was described as circular, yellowish-white in color, and was observed for an estimated five minutes before it shot away southward. The report provides details of the sighting and the object's appearance and movements.

OHIO POLICEMEN REPORT UFO

Mentor, Ohio
3 May 1964

Mentor, Ohio - May 3 - A bright UFO reportedly seen over Lake Erie from Mentor - witnessed by John D. Hadden, Lake County deputy sheriff, and Manager of Mentor Police, who, fearing ridicule, declined to give their names.

They first saw the object in the east, descending slowly. It was round, disc-shaped and glowed with a soft light. All of a sudden, it started to expand or come nearer in its approach, and, after about one minute, once again diminished to its former size.

The UFO then shot away southward at an extremely high velocity. The object zoomed behind the tree tops and then emerged into the clear, descending a curving path which ended abruptly in less than 10 seconds.

The object was described by Hadden as circular, a yellowish white in color, with a soft glow.

A woman near Painesville, a town near Mentor, reportedly observed the object in the sky thereafter. Patrolman Don Janz visited the object in its southward flight from Mentor. On The Lake, the craft was judged to be similar in size to an 11" object held edge to edge at arm's length.

The full text of the document is as follows:

Mr. Hanes, Sr.

Pittsfield, New Jersey

Dear Witnesses:

This letter is a follow-up to a report made by Mr. [redacted] Sr. to the U.S. Air Force on May 9, 1964. We have begun a new program aimed at systematically analyzing the reports on UFO sightings filed on which investigations have been conducted. The purpose of this conclusion is to indicate that the phenomenon seems to continue long after your report was made.  

As is often the case, the initial material filed on the basis of your UFO report consists of very limited information which would help a person get through the files understand why the object was reported to the Air Force. In the information available, it is not clear from your report what was reported in the first place, or what observations led to your report being submitted.

The first object was shaped like a blimp gondola; the second looked like a diamond. One object seen first, five seen second time. Four blue-white windows in "blimp gondola", one who looked like landing lights shining straight down. One witness saw swept-back wings also seen - second object semicircular with bright center-light. 

More follow information on saturated speeds and ground track.

You can see that anyone re-reading the report would get very little of the original incident out of it, and that is what we are trying to correct. The purpose of this letter is to ask you for a re-statement of the incident as you recall it, so that we can have on hand something against which other similar reports can be compared. It is not that we suspect any inaccuracy in your first report, but that the original report seldom gives us all that we need to make comparisons.

I am going to indicate some points we need to have cleared up, and ask a number of questions. Feel free to answer in any way you please, the best way being simply to write as clear an account as you can, referring to the questions only as you feel they help you give us the information we need to know.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text document discussing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. As per the instruction, I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document.

Let us take the two objects one at a time. First, the "blimp gondola."

1. Can you make a sketch of it?
2. Did it shine with its own light, or did there appear to be some other source of light illuminating it?
3. The "landing light" was reported as shining straight down; did the course of light appear to move a distance, like a searchlight, or a small diameter, like a distant automobile headlight?
4. Did the "landing light" seem to be of a brightness normal for an aircraft landing light?
5. Was the object itself clearly outlined all the way around, or was it seen as if through a haze?
6. Could the shape of the "four or five windows" be seen? What made them look like windows instead of, for example, lights mounted on the object?
7. Did the object appear to be spinning or rotating, or was it travelling in a straight line? How was it oriented?
8. Clearly, the witnesses are familiar with the appearance of airplanes; how did this object differ from an aircraft, that made you think it was a familiar object?
9. Did the light illuminate the ground, surrounding trees, or houses?
10. How did the object disappear - suddenly or slowly?
11. Have you had any thoughts on what it might have been?

Now to the second sighting. There is less information available on this one, so please concentrate the remaining questions on the details.
1. Can you sketch the formation? Did it change?
2. What were the colors of the lights?
3. Did the lights move as if they were all attached to the same object or invisible framework, or did they move relative to one another?
4. How bright were the lights in comparison with the first object?
5. How bright were the lights in comparison with bright stars, or objects (in the distance) like after sunset this fall?
6. Was the light which veered off one of the "four" that had been in diamond formation; or was it a completely new light?
