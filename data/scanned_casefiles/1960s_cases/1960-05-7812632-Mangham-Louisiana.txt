j. According to Major R. R. GRODHAUS, Intelligence Officer, ENGLAND AFB, LA. the ENGLAND AFB Weather Office stated definitely that the object sighted was a weather balloon released at NATCHEZ, MISSISSIPPI.

k. See COMMENTS of Preparing Officer below.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Sheriff of LOUISIANA, a licensed civilian pilot, stated that he was certain the object was a weather balloon. Major R. F. GRODHAUS, Intelligence Officer, ENGLAND AFB, LA. received the initial report of sighting on 22 May 1960. It was Major GRODHAUS who received definite word from the ENGLAND AFB Weather Office that the object was a weather balloon which placed the object in the category of a known object rather than an UFO. Therefore did not make an initial UFO report in accordance with AFR 200-2. (Maj. GRANT was the Preparing Officer.)

After preliminary analysis, it is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the object was a weather balloon.

[Signed]
CHESTER B. HANSON
Captain, USAF
Intelligence Officer

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
I concur with the findings of the Preparing Officer and agree that the object was, in all probability, a weather balloon.
