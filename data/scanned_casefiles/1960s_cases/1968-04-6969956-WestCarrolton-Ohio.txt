The image appears to be a technical document with multiple panels containing various types of maps or charts. The text is mostly illegible due to the low resolution and faintness of the writing. Some words like "MOV" and "HON" can be partially made out, but most of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly. The document seems to contain topographical or meteorological charts with contour lines, grid markings, and scattered numerical annotations.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                3 April 1968

Subj: Balloon Launch (Accidental), 2 Apr 68

At 1530 hours, Lt Col Hippler, AFRSTA, called regarding a balloon that got away at the Holloman AFB. It was a big "V" shaped balloon and may have appeared to be two sausage shaped objects connected at the balloon. He thought that we might receive reports on it since there were planes going around it and following it. The FAA had been notified that it was loose and was in air routes. It got away at approximately 8 am local, MST, and was expected to impact around 1430 hours, local. It had gone up to altitudes of 30,000 and at 1330 hours, local was at approximately 15,000 ft alt. If we needed further information we could get it from the balloon launch facilities at Holloman.

Second Field Report
(new form 164)
(3 bottom)

April 5, 1968
Thunderbolt, Ga. 31404

Major Hector Quintinilla, USAF
UFO Project
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Sir:

This is to report the sighting of an unusual aerial object on April 4, 1968, over Thunderbolt, Ga. At 7:40 p.m. two boys were using a small telescope on the lawn of a residence at Rosd. The boy not observing through the telescope suddenly exclaimed to the other to the effect that something unusual was moving in the sky. Both boys then observed the object until it disappeared from view behind trees to the north.

When the boys related this to me I separated them and asked each one to draw the object he had seen. While they were making the drawings I called Hunter Army Air Field and reported the sighting to the officer with whom I was connected when I asked for the UFO officer. The boys finished the drawings within ten minutes after seeing the object.

According to the boys' accounts, the object was moving almost due north along a south-north line about 80 degrees above the western horizon. It was moving "much faster" than a jet aircraft that had passed overhead shortly before. It left no trail and no sound was heard.

According to both boys, the object presented a clearly visible disc and had extensions from both sides that carried small lights at their ends. The attitude of the object was constant and the motion was at a constant rate. It was enveloped in a bright orange glow, described by one boy as a mist.

On the evening of the sighting there was intermittent broken cloud cover over the Savannah area but at the time of the sighting the sky was clear. Sighting was by visual observation only because the movement was too fast to permit aiming the telescope. Several helicopters from the training base at Hunter were aloft in the vicinity, but both boys maintain that the object could not have been a helicopter.

Enclosed herewith are the drawings made by the boys. That labeled "A" was made by a 15-year-old. The other boy is an unusually bright 10-year-old.

The older boy, incidentally, has a story that might be worth investigation. About three years ago, he was one of a group of about ten Boy Scouts camping on Big Wylie Island near Savannah who were badly frightened by a huge, orange-glowing object that apparently rose from the island near their camp.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]

SIGHTING ACCOUNT

The witness was on top of Sagamore Hill where two Radio Telescopes are located to watch the Eclipse of the moon. He noticed a brightly-lit object in the West which was hovering at an elevation of 10°. No shape was seen behind the colored lights which were blinking very rapidly and yet were together. Distance was estimated at 6 miles. Suddenly, after watching the object in a hovering mode for about a minute, it shot upwards at a 35° angle until it reach an elevation estimated at 45° and just blinked out or disappeared. Its speed seemed much faster than a conventional aircraft's speed. (Not Sirius this time!)

(Unconventional Lights)

SKETCH OF UFO:

REMARKS

The witness is working landscaping until he joins the military this summer. He is a student pilot, knows aircraft and their identification lights. He said he never would have reported it if he had thought it were an aircraft. This report is one of many received between April 10-20th. It is evaluated as a low-weight "unknown".

BEVERLY - What has flashing lights, flies low and goes "whish"?

A UFO, that's what.
Some Beverly's finest aren't talking about their chases Sunday night. As a matter of fact the official police blotter is devoid of any mention of the incident.

But the strange looking thing in the sky had some persons excited. It was seen, as one time of the evening during the late evening hours. One cruiser patrolman said he thought it might have been a plane, but when it flew low, it didn't make any noise.

"I don't know what the answer is," he commented to one confidant. "But until somebody explains it I'm not saying anything!"

NICAP MASS REPORT # 68-21 -- 14 April 1968, 9:00 PM EST, Beverly, Mass.

INVESTIGATORS REPORT                                   By Robert Jackson

Approximately 9:00 PM, the Beverly Police Department received 2 phone calls (no names given) from residents of Beverly complaining of white lights out near the New England Electrical Power Plant on Salem Neck. Officers Harold Goff and Victor Penny responded to the calls by driving to Quincy Park off River Street on the shoreline overlook. They arrived and found several parked cars and witnesses standing on the sidewalk of River Street looking out over the water. Officer Dunn stated that he first saw a string of steady bright white lights due South moving toward and to the right of him from the water on their side of the power plant. There was no sound at all coming from the object. He said there were at least 5 lights that maybe were more. The sighting of lights continued with 2 other lights (as detailed later) and finally a little behind them. The lights then stopped right over some house and trees where a rapid sequence of flashing began from left-right as it hovered. It can began moving slowly (lights still flashing in left-to-right sequence) westward where it disappeared for only a few seconds behind some trees and then reappeared again moving southward out over the water where it first appeared. It moved to a position due South where it stopped again and THEN A SPOTLIGHT OF SOME SORT TURNED ON AND PROJECTED STRAIGHT DOWN ON THE WATER, illuminating much of the harbor. Then, suddenly it streaked off on a northward course. Enemy stated that at the last part of the object streaked away - "Dido not see that it" (Later, Carpenito said that the object streaked away. This was not noticed by the other officers). Enemy stated that there were numerous planes out over the water and that he could hear the jet engines on many of them as they circled in their landing pattern to Logan Airport, Boston, Mass. But, he could not hear anything except the point of sighting. At one point and at a seemingly low altitude. This is what amazed the officers - no sound. Officer Goff did not seem to remember as many details of the sighting unless Enemy was exaggerating but both agreed some details were ridiculous so much that nothing was reported to NICAP, MASS. We found out through this report and a brief newsclip which is enclosed as part of this report.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS/EVALUATION                          By Raymond E. Fowler

I find this sighting hard to evaluate. It has all the characteristics of a B-52 Flare Drop except for the fact 1) At one time the lights were steady; 2) The hovering mode and searchlight emanating from the object; 3) The streaking off in the North.

I tried to obtain Flare Drop data for this date from 8th AF at Westover AFB but was told it involved too much research. Hanscom AFB stated they had received no reports this date. I also talked to the UFO officer at Otis AFB who similarly does not recall a Flare Drop type report. I have witnesses on Cape Cod who have an excellent vantage point but he had no records of this sighting. The official tracking showed no variants but this seems unlikely. My evaluation is "Unknown", possibly flares. If it were flares, the report is valuable for "witness impressions of flares".

Respectfully submitted, R.E. Fowler

RE: UFO's

Dear Dr. Hynek:

Saturday evening, April 13, 1968, eight of us had a rather unusual experience that I feel should be registered with your reports of UFO's.

This letter is not a hoax, as the men that witnessed this phenomenon are business executives of good reputation in the San Francisco Bay Area.

We were just departing from a friend's home high on a dark hill in Albany, California (about 12:30 a.m.). We had not been drinking as we had been playing bridge. While standing in the street saying goodnight, one of the men noticed something in the sky headed directly towards us.

It was a bright, but not so bright object. As it drew closer we could see that it was very shiny (sort of like a highly polished piece of aluminum), with exhaust, similar to our rockets, coming from underneath. The metal was so shiny that we could not determine the shape or color, except that the exhaust came from underneath. It was very quiet. There wasn't a bit of noise as it passed directly over our heads. It came from out of the west (from the east), circled along the east shore of the Bay, then disappeared, headed northwest. Enclosed is a map of the route.

My husband said it could have been anywhere from 1,000 feet to 5,000 feet high as there was no way to judge the elevation.

Our first thought was that it must be a weather balloon, but there wasn't a breeze blowing that evening. If there had been, in order to move a balloon at that rate of speed, we would have soon had a cyclone. Besides, it stayed at about the same elevation. It disappeared.

I work for the University of California Press, Production Department. Our Space Sciences Laboratory referred you to me.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

Here are the legible text elements I can discern from the document:

Top right: "San Francisco"

Left side (partially legible):
"Overlook"
"Stratight"

Center area:
"Beg bridge"
"Gen"

Right side:
"Red"

The document appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram with curved lines and annotations, but some text is difficult to fully read due to the handwritten nature and image quality.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES APRIL 15-21, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. The Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available, and may be obtained by writing to the Environmental Data Service, ESSA, Silver Spring, Maryland 20852.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps and on which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analysis result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature isotherms of the 500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The temperature is shown as shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m./e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Chart indicates areas and amounts of precipitation by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in hundredths of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

MONDAY, APRIL 15, 1968

[The rest of the text is part of a weather map with various meteorological notations such as "HIGH", "LOW", and curved lines representing weather patterns. The specific text on the map is too small and numerous to transcribe completely.]


- page 88 -

There is very little legible text in this image. I can only make out a few words:

"LOW" appears multiple times on the image
"HIGH" appears at least once

The image appears to be a series of meteorological or topographical maps/charts with contour lines, scattered numerical annotations, and what seem to be geographical or weather-related diagrams.


- page 89 -

TUESDAY, APRIL 16, 1968

The rest of the text is illegible or appears to be part of a weather map or meteorological chart with contour lines, low pressure areas, and various markings. The document contains multiple sections of maps or charts with curved lines and scattered small symbols.


- page 90 -

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 15 April 1968
     (Day)   (Month)  (Year)

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

[The rest of the page is blank]


- page 91 -

There is very little legible text on this page. I can only make out a few instances of "MOV" (possibly an abbreviation) on the contour map in the bottom right quadrant of the image. The page appears to be a series of diagrams or maps with contour lines, scattered dots, and curved lines, but no substantial readable text is present.


- page 92 -

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 17, 1968

[The rest of the text is too small or illegible to accurately transcribe. The image appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric map with curved lines, contours, and various markings, typical of a weather chart from that era.]


- page 93 -

There is very little legible text in this image. The only partially legible text I can discern is some small numbers scattered across the various map/chart sections, and what appears to be a partial text label at the bottom right of the bottom right panel, but it is too blurry to read with certainty. The image appears to be a series of topographical or meteorological charts/maps with contour lines and scattered numerical annotations.

THURSDAY, APRIL 18, 1968

[Note: The rest of the text appears to be part of a weather map with various meteorological notations such as "HIGH" and "LOW", but the specific text is too small or blurry to read clearly. The image contains contour lines, geographical outlines, and scattered markings typical of a weather chart.]

At the bottom left of the image, there is a smaller section of a similar weather map with contour lines.

At the bottom right of the image, there appears to be a section with numerous small markings or data points.


- page 95 -

There is no readable text in this image. The document appears to be a series of maps or charts with various lines, contours, and markings. The top two panels seem to show geographical outlines with scattered numerical notations, while the bottom panel contains concentric curved lines that resemble topographical or meteorological contour lines.


- page 96 -

FRIDAY, APRIL 19, 1968

The rest of the text is illegible or too small to read clearly. The image appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric chart with curved lines, contour markings, and some small symbols scattered throughout. There are three sections to the document, with the main section being a larger map-like diagram, and two smaller diagrams at the bottom of the page.


- page 97 -

The text I can clearly read is:

HIGH

The rest of the image appears to be a series of diagrams or maps with curved lines, contour lines, and scattered small markings/numbers, but the text is not fully legible in those areas.


- page 98 -

SATURDAY, APRIL 20, 1968

[The rest of the text appears to be part of a weather map with various lines, contours, and markings indicating weather patterns, with labels such as "HIGH", "LOW", and "FREEZING" visible. However, the specific details of the text within the map are not clearly legible.]


- page 99 -

The text I can discern in this image is:

HIGH (appears twice)
Some numbers scattered across the various sections of the document, primarily in the top right quadrant
Some very faint text along the bottom margin which is mostly illegible

The image appears to be a technical document with multiple sections showing what seem to be topographical or meteorological contour maps or diagrams, with curved lines, scattered numerical annotations, and different graphical representations.


- page 100 -

SUNDAY, APRIL 21, 1968

[The rest of the text is part of the weather map and is mostly illegible due to the small size and low resolution of the image. The image appears to be a surface weather map with contour lines, "HIGH" and "LOW" pressure areas, and various markings across what seems to be a map of the United States.]
