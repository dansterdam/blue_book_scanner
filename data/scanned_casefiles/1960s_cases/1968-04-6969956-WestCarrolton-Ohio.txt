MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: Balloon Launch (Accidental), 2 Apr 63
At 1230 hours, Lt Col Hippie, AFSPTA, called regarding a balloon that got away at the Holloman AFB. It was a big "V" shaped balloon and may have appeared to be two sausages shaped objects connected at the balloon. He thought that we might have some reports on it since there were plans going around it and following it. The PFI had been notified that it was loose and was in air route. It got away at approximately 8 am local, MST, and was expected to impact around 1230 hours, local. It had gone up to altitudes of 30,000 and at 1230 hours, local was at approximately 15,000 ft alt. If we needed further information we could get it from the balloon launch facilities at Holloman.

Text from the document:

April 5, 1968
Thunderbolt, Ga. 31404

Major Hector Quintinilla, USAF
UFO Project
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Sir:

This is to report the sighting of an unusual aerial object on April 4, 1968 near Thunderbolt, Ga. At 6:40 p.m. two boys were playing behind the house. The boys suddenly exclaimed to their mother that they had seen the object.

The boys not observing through the telescope suddenly exclaimed to the other to the effect that the object was moving in the sky. Both boys then observed the object until it disappeared from view.

When the boys related this to me I separated them and asked each one to draw the object he had seen. While they were making the drawings I called Hunter Army Air Field and reported the sighting to the officer in charge. When I asked them I noted the sightings were connected.

The boys finished the drawings within ten minutes after seeing the object.

According to the boys' accounts, the object was moving almost due north at about 5000 feet altitude. It descended to the western horizon and passed overhead shortly before. It left no trail and no sound was heard.

According to both boys, the object presented a clearly visible disc and had extended from both sides small lights at their ends. The attitude of the object was constant and the motion was at a constant rate. It was described by one boy as a mist.

One of the evenings of the sighting there was intermittent broken cloud cover over the Savannah area but at the time of the sighting the sky was clear. Sighting was only because the movement was too fast to permit aiming the telescope. Several witnesses other than the two boys maintain that the object could not have been a helicopter.

Enclosed herewith are the drawings made by the boys. That labeled "A" was made by the 16-year-old and the other by the 14-year-old. The other boy, incidentally, has a story that might be worth investigating. About three years ago, he was one of a group of about ten Boy Scouts camping on Big Wylie Island near Savannah who were badly frightened by a huge, orange-glowing object that apparently rose from the island near their camp.

Sincerely yours,

We were leaving the town to come home at about 9:15, and as we drove along the lower end of Jeffery Road we saw what we thought was a bright star. We soon realized that it was coming towards us and came to be a size of approximately 10 to 12 feet in diameter. It appeared to be a solid object, glowing and metallic in appearance, and it moved off at a different direction and we got in the car and came home.

The witness was on top of Sagamore Hill where two Radio Telescopes are located to watch the eclipse of the moon. He noticed a bright light which was opening up from approximately 10° - No escape was at first seen as the colored lights were blinking very rapidly and constantly. He observed the object in the hovering mode for about a minute. It shot away at 45° until it disappeared. Its speed seemed much faster than conventional airborne objects. (Not conventional aircraft while time!)

The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document, containing two main components:

1. A sketch/diagram showing the elevation of an observed object above the horizon, as well as its position relative to a compass. The sketch includes labeled angles and lines to indicate the object's position.

2. A request to the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion of the observed object or objects, indicating their path and any changes in direction during the course.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

RE: UFO's

Dear Dr. Hynek:

Saturday evening, April 13, 1968, eight of us had a rather unusual experience with some reports of UFO's.

This letter is not a hoax, as the men who witnessed this phenomenon are quite reputable and would certainly not do so. If you need a list of names I shall be happy to supply you with them.

We were just departing from a friend's home high on a dark hill in XXXX (about 15 miles from our home). As we drove, we had been drinking a little while standing in the street saying goodby, when one of the kids noticed something on the horizon, standing out quite clearly. At first we thought it was a star or planet, but it soon became evident that it was no star or planet. It was a bright light, very brilliant, changing colors from deep red to white. It appeared to be quite large, perhaps 20 to 30 feet in diameter, but there was no shiny or metallic reflection such as we would not determine the size or shape - except to say it was very eerie and unlike anything we had ever seen before. As the object came closer, moving rapidly, we could see it had a definite oval shape - almost like a huge football - but there were no protruding parts that we could make out. It was quite high, perhaps 2,000 to 3,000 feet up as near as we could judge by the stars. The object passed directly overhead, emitting no sound whatsoever. It then banked sharply and continued on out toward the bay, where it seemed to disappear in a haze over the horizon.

My friend said it could have been anywhere from 1,000 feet to 5,000 feet high as there was no way to judge the elevation.

The objects seemed to dart about, moving rapidly to the west, then suddenly it would turn and head back the other way. In order to observe it better, we started our car and followed it for a few minutes, but it soon left us far behind and we lost sight of it.

I would appreciate it if you would let me know if there have been any other reports of similar sightings in this area. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

RECEIVED

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old U.S. Department of Commerce/Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service document titled "DAILY WEATHER MAPS" for the weekly series from April 15-21, 1968.

The text in the document is as follows:

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES APRIL 15-21, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau Daily Publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, and the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports on this map are arranged in a regular pattern and apply to a fraction of those are excluded for the operations analyses and on which the analysis are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from the station reports that cannot be included in the published analysis because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above mean sea level. The temperatures are shown as dashed lines.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest tenth are given for the same period under each station location. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show a depth of snow on the ground measured at 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

The image contains a photograph that appears to be a specimen station model, which is a visual aid used to illustrate weather data and patterns. The model depicts various symbols and graphics related to weather conditions and meteorological data.
