27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

Details Are Described As Well As I Can Remember Them. I Am Not Really Sure of the Date of the Sighting, but I Reported the Sighting Soon As It Was Over, and the Letter I Received with this Questionnaire Stated It Was Dec. 5, 1968. Neighbors Came and Told My Wife and I to Come Outside and Look at this Object. One of the Neighbor's Children Said he Had Seen it Before and His Mother Would Not Come Outside to Look.

We Watched it for Approximately 60 Sec. & It Disappeared Below the Horizon. Immediately I Called a Friend, Who Works at the Arkansas Power and Light Steam Generating Station About 30r 4 Miles Below Helena. They Had Seen Nothing. This is About Where I Thought the UFO Might Have Been Seen Easily, and They Are Always Out on the Structures.

Seeing the Airplane and Being a Pilot Myself, I Immediately Called the Memphis Flight Service Station to See if Contact Could be Made with the Plane If They Made Contact with this Particular Plane, I Never Knew. They Referred me to Millington Naval Air Station and Wright-Patterson A.F.B.

I Later Received a Questionnaire Almost Identical to This One. I Answered a Questionnaire. I Certify These Statements to Be True and Correct to the Best of My Remembrance.
