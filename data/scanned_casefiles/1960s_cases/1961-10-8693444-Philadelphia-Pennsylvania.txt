The text in the document is as follows:

War Department
WASHINGTON, D.C.

October 19th, 1961

Dear Sir:

I wish to report an unusual object in the sky over Overbrook, Philadelphia, Penna. Time 6:30 p.m. place, between City Line and Wynnefield on 63rd Ave., Phila., Penna. (I live at 6321 Upland St.,Phila. 31, Penna.) when I saw what at first was like a comet. Fiery ball as the head of the ball was a red object. The object was not traveling like a meteor. It seemed to be stationary and then would move a little and stop, something like we have never seen before. At 7 p.m. it faded into the ground, something like the old movies when they fade into the ground.

I thought you would like to have this report and also to check with any object that the United States Air Force may have had in the air at that time. I do not know if there was any report made from the Press on this matter, but what ever it was it was BIG and I have never seen anything like it but the initial report.

Again final report: Object fell like a lone yellow ball, meteors, comet, satellite or fell like a lightning/ground shock, that is the final report I have.

Most faithfully Yours,
Washington, D.C.

The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram depicting the motion of an object observed, with annotations describing the object's appearance and behavior. There is no photographic image present in this particular page.

Extracting the text from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
TAIL RED

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

- page 10 -

The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line to demonstrate how high an object was above the horizon when you first saw it, and a straight line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. The second sketch shows two different perspectives of the same scene - one labeled "A" and the other labeled "B" - to illustrate how the object's position changed.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
