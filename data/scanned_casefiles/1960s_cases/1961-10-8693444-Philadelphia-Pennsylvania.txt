War Department
Washington,D.C.                                October 14th, 1961

Dear Sir:

1 wish to report an unusual object in the sky over Overbrook,Philad,Penna
Time 6:50, place, between City Line and Wynnefield on Eryn Mawr Avenue,Philad
Penna. OCT 15, 1961

What My Helper and I seen in the sky, it was like a Comet, fiery
tall at the head of the tail was a red object, the object was NOT traveling
up in the sky but as a plane would travel, the speed was slow. It was a Big
object like 1 seen in 1912 the Halley Comet, yet this object was so close to
the ground, something like we have never seen before. At 7 P.M it faded into
the sky, and that was all we seen of it.

I thought you would like to have this report and also to check with any
object that the United States Government may have had at that time if
they have sent up any missile at that time, or not. No report I have heard from
the Press on this matter, but what every it was, it was BIG and I have never seen
anything like it but the Halley comet in 1912.

Again final report. Object Ball of Fire with a long yellow tail, noiseless,
again noiseless, speed like the Halley Comet slow, flying across sky, but is the
report, but a most Beautiful sight.

Most Faithfully Yours,
Washington,D.C.

Copy of original letter to Dr. [redacted]
Major Colman will fill in my form and send address on envelope
thank you for your letter and forms.

October 30th, 1961

Dear Dr. [redacted]

I have just received a letter from Major Wm T.Coleman,Jr Department of the Air Force, Office of the Secretary UFO Project Information O. in regards to an object my Helper and I seen on 18th of October 1961 at 6150 P.M at [redacted] Avenue in the 2200 block, and from this you told My Wife that you also been this object at the Presidential Apt's that same evening.

Since all this is Most Important to the United States Government would you Please fill out the form here and return same to me so that I can forward your report and mine to Major Coleman. I wish I had a camera and field glasses with me to take sure what over I see will be proof of the finds.

What and I seen that evening, and [redacted] seen it first, as we looked at the object it seems to us that in front was a Gondola or what I would call the pilot room, from what I also seen and [redacted] been was like a window in this Pilot room as I seen a light shape, and a long tail, and what a tail, and silent, as we watched this in movement it was traveling very slow for about five minutes and then it gained speed and was out of sight fast.

As from above and in any plane if you lit a match at dusk it would be seen from above, and no doubt if this was a Russian made skyroket or some sort, the front of this object was red. Unless we take more time and look towards the heavens we may be caught some day unprepared. At first I thought it was a comet like the one I seen in 1912 the Hailey Comet, but no I see it now is could be Russian made project.

Thanking you Dr. [redacted] for the filled out form here in, and how many more of your party seen this. Thank you for reading this letter, and for the Service you rendered first dental work. I am Very Pleased with it all.

P.S. I am enclosing a letter to where you can send your report, this letter or envelope I received two of them, so send your form to the address on this envelope, and if my letter, send same to this address.

Faithfully Yours,
