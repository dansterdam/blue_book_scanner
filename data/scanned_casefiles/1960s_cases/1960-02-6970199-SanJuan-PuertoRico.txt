SIGHTING WOULD INDICATE A POSSIBLE REENTRY OF SOME VARIETY OF
BALLISTIC MISSILE OR EARTH SATELLITE VEHICLE. THE MANNER IN WHICH
OBJECT DISAPPEARED (SEE ITEM B(5) ABOVE) IS THE PRIMARY SUPPORT FOR
THIS ANALYSIS. ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATED AZIMUTH WHEN FIRST SIGHTED
COMPARED TO AZIMUTH UPON DISAPPEARANCE WOULD INDICATE MOVEMENT FROM
