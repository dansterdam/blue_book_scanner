Gentlemen:

I am in the Air Reserve, 84 Comm (IRAS) USAF, and am at present rolling in a course of astronomy at the Adler Planetarium. A course of modern astronomy. Since astronomy has always been of interest to me and since I have considered joining the Air Force Space Command, I hope what I have to say here is not taken as lighthearted as some letters I am sure you have received.

In regard to Sputnik IV, I may have seen the disintegration within twelve hours of its predicted eclipse.

In regard to Discoverer XI and capsules, I may have seen it landed to be quite different from that of Discoverer VI, or what I would surmise to have been capsules of Discoverers VII and VIII. However, I wouldn't want to write you another letter concerning what might appear to be my own opinions or conclusions. These may be appreciated and in such a case would do my utmost, being observant, very careful, and possibly of assistance.

Thank you for your letter concerning your possible observation of the sighting of Sputnik IV. We have forwarded your letter to Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official project for the investigation of unidentified flying objects in the United States.

Information concerning Soviet satellite activities is not appropriate, as the Air Force's knowledge of activities in space is appreciable.
