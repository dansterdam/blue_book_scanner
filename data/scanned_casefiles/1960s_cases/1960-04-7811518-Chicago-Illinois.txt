Officers; Gentlemen:

I am in the Air Reserve, HQ ComAC (I3S) AAAC, and am at present enrolled in a course of astronomy at the Adler Planetarium. A survey of Modern Astronomy. Since astronomy has always, to any extent, intrigued me; and since my eyesight is considered to be normal --- I hope what I have to say here is not taken as lightly as some of the letters I am sure you have received.

In regard to Sputnik IV: I may have seen its disintegration. Perhaps within twelve hours of its predicted eclipse.

In regard to Discoverer XI and capsule: I may have seen its disintegration. It seemed to be quite different from that of Sputnik IV, or what I assumed to be Sputnik IV. (Clarification ---- the capsule's disintegration.)

I would very much like to write you another letter concerning the above. However, I wouldn't want to waste your time as well as mine by continuing what might appear to be fiction. Therefore, an acknowledgment of this letter would be appreciated and in such a case I would do my best to give details concerning azimuth, time, length of descent, duration of descent, color, brilliance, characteristics of descent, etc. Thank you for your patience.

Respectfully,

[Signature area blacked out]
