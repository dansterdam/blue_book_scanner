11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer stated that he "saw a phenomena in August 1967 on the parking lot pavement about 50 feet long, 6 feet high, and two little men, or what ever. They were the size of midgets which ran across my head light beams racing for the phenomena in which they disappeared into a panel which opened up and closed before taking off."

I saw a phenomenon up in August 9 1967, on the parking lot pavement about 50 ft away - 6 ft high. 2 with men, on hot sunny day - the size of multiple items across my head. Large beams going for the phenomenon air looking like crossproject into a panel white sky + closed. Before taking off, sky was orange. I was apparent to me to see blocks and ten swirls - real shimmery which colored them from heat to red, as sort of they entered the phenomenon, a red shift of flame stuff out from the near time. I up it went straight up - no wind into a rocket with no movement. Shimmery sound, I would say - with bright brown phenomenon. Slowly I watched it - no jolting - with an 5 minutes, should name it to get the other photo.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 20330
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Dear Mr.

President Johnson has asked that I reply to your recent letter regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The Air Force is responsible for investigating reported sightings of UFOs to determine if they pose a threat to the United States. After investigating some 12,000 sightings in the past 20 years, no evidence has been presented to prove that they do. Attached is information on UFOs which I hope you will find interesting and informative.

I am informed that we do not have a record of the sighting of August 1967 which you mention. Therefore, it is requested you complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the envelope provided so that an analysis of your observation can be made. It will not be necessary for you to travel to Washington to make this report.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

Sincerely,
B. M. ETTENSON
Colonel, USAF

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT                                1/4/68

I AM WRITING TO YOU REGARDING A MATTER OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE, WHICH I BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT TO OUR
COUNTRIES. SINCE MY TALK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
HAS COME TO SEE ME TO TALK WITH ME REGARDING THIS
IMPORTANT MATTER, I DECIDED TO WRITE TO YOU AS
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IF THE GOVERNMENT
WOULD PUT MY WAY TO WASHINGTON, D.C. ETC., I WOULD
BE VERY HAPPY TO COME AND TALK TO YOU OR ANY
COMMITTEE TO TELL EXACTLY WHAT I SAW ETC.

IN AUGUST OF 1967, I WAS EMPLOYED BY MONROE COUNTY, ROCHESTER,
NY AS A GUARD IN ONE OF THE COUNTY PARKS IN
CHURCHVILLE, NY FROM 4 PM TO 12 MIDNIGHT, ON OR
ABOUT 10 PM ON THIS ONE EVENING UPON DRIVING INTO THE PARK
PARKING LOT OF THE PARK, WHICH IS PITCH BLACK, MY
HEADLIGHTS FROM MY TRUCK FELL UPON A FLYING SAUCER
SET JUST RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARKING LOT, WELL, LITTLE
MEN ON THE SIDE OF MIDGETS AND RIGHT ACROSS MY HEADLIGHTS.
FOR THE SAUCER, THEY WALKED WHAT SEEMED TO ME LIKE BOOK
SHINY RUBBER SUITS FROM HEAD TO TOE, THEY DISAPPEARED
INTO A LITTLE OPENING OF THE SAUCER NEAR THE BODY, IN WHICH
A PANEL SLID COMING IN WITH IT SECONDS, A SHORT TIME.

Shot out the dear end, it went the smoke straight up into the sky. I illumined it up nice these with a bright beam but that I had until I could no longer see it. I watched it right come to my park office's zero it to the sheriff's dept.

About 4-hours later, many people, including the sheriff, deputy sheriffs, sited the source in the sky & reported some. Since the story appeared in the news papers etc. everything bothered some. I was fired from my job. Some people said I was etc. Some said I must have been drunk etc. Mr. President!

For the rest of my life, I shall never forget the sight I seen in that night. I want to come to your president, only my committee you want me to talk to regarding this matter, which as I said before is important to our country. So Mr. President, if you would arrange for me to be brought to Washington D.C.

I appear before you, or with ever you want me to appear before, I would be very happy to come & explain in detail what I saw, the shape, size etc.

Very truly yours,

Rochester, N.Y. 11/16/67
