STATEMENT

On or about 1460 CST, 14 Se tember 1960 I happened to look up at the sky and spotted a bright object. When I first noticed the object it appeared to be coming from the southwest and traveling in a 2 zone course toward a northeast direction. I called my family to see it.

In the mean time I went over to a friend of ours (Captain ______) to have him look at it.

After watching the object for ten minutes I called our Base Weather station to check it out. When I returned further outside the object it appeared to have slowed down to a near zero speed and hovered in the U.S. I have seen many Russian satellites out west and have also seen our local satellites. This UFO wasn't like the others. It seemed to be on a straight course and very steady. There was no tumbling of satellite where the lights came off or on. It was very bright from the time I noticed it and until it disappeared.

I am forwarding this report and will join the ATIC later.
