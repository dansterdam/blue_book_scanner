THE OBSERVER'S ACCOUNT AND OTHER SIMILAR UFO REPORTS IN THIS AREA,
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS UFO WAS A HOT AIR BALLOON. THIS TYPE OF
ACTIVITY HAS BEEN NOTED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES. THE
CHILDREN MAKE HOT AIR BALLOONS BY SEALING THE TOP OF PLASTIC CLOTHES
BAGS AND FIXING A CANDLE TO A PIECE OF CARDBOARD TO THE BOTTOM OF
THE BAG. THE BURNING CANDLE PROVIDES HEATED AIR IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY
TO SUSTAIN ASCENT OF THE BALLOON.
