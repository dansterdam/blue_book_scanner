11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a hazy object that was dimmer than the moon would normally appear, however it was not visible but it did move to the right and returned to former position in one hour. Others had been watching the object for nearly 9 hours. The object was darker than the surrounding sky. Even the stars were brighter than the object.

Considering the available information it appears that the observers were watching some type of balloon that has often been used as advertising trinkets. A large balloon held in place with a wire would account for the sighting.

[Note: Some text is obscured/blacked out, so I will transcribe the legible portions]

My attention is the phenomenon as I was panning to my home of 22w 77 St. We explored the object nice 3:30 pm. I took out my binoculars and viewed it. For myself at 9 p.m. It was dark clear sky, no moon in sky. About a dozen stars scattered around which were brighter than the object. This was in center of round dark area of sky and would perhaps be a solid instead of a hole seemed to be a third of the couple area.

I was told by my [blacked out] balloon like object come down from the object or a line drawn through migo as it gradually drifted behind the Museum of Natural Statement. No I cannot attach that is my 9 pm and 11 pm. I certainly would be more interested to know if anyone else observed this object. Thank you for writing me.
