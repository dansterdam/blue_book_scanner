TO: SSQOL

The following was extracted from the SSD Staff Duty Officer's Report
for the period 1630 18 Feb 65 to 0800 15 Feb 65:

At 2315, a Sgt, Costa Mesa called requesting AF assistance, her son, age 16, had been hiking,
camping in the Mt Palomar vicinity on the night of 13 Feb (Sat) 
with 4 (?) other boys when they spotted an intensive, highly con-
centrated beam of light. The light source in addition was emitting
some type of audible signal. When the boys approached the light,
it turned directly in their faces with the light source seemingly
calling them as they attempt to depart the scene of initial contact.
They turned and fired a few rounds of ammunition at it from the
small arms they carried. The source seemed to be a ground location
and it was doubtful that it can be categorized in the UFO.

Her husband is a Navy enlisted man at San Diego and advised
her to contact authorities. She phoned the FBI who put her in touch
with AFOSI. As SDO I contacted a Capt Reichmuth (Foreign Tech) at
the suggestion of the CPC NCO. Capt Reichmuth further suggested I
take the matter over to the FBD Office. Request necessary action be
taken to inform the FBD of the incident in order that she may be
called back. (She asked that she be contacted) Her number at work
is [redacted] (8:30 - 12:30). Her home phone is [redacted]
