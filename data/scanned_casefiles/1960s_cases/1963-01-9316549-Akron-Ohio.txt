RAVENNA - ROOTSTOWN - Jan. 9, 1963 - 6:10
- 6:22 P.M. Mr. Rice and two other observers were witness to a strange event in local skies. Their attention was drawn to a very bright light source almost directly overhead. Mr. [redacted] described it as round and white in color. As they watched the stationary object, it changed from white to reddish-orange. After ten(10) minutes the object split into three(3) parts; all three parts proceeded southward and disappeared. The size of the object was like that of an auto headlight...the object was either very low or tremendous in size if this in fact was an estimate made at arms length. (From KIWS UFO Program)

Excerpt from CD Report - Capt. Neil - 7 Feb Jun 63

At 2015 Mr. [redacted] called to report the following:

While out hunting he noticed small strips of tin foil scattered over a wide area of farm land. He was curious at the time, but did not collect any samples of the material. He became more curious and concerned when he read that British bombers had penetrated our air defenses, and thought that perhaps the foil strips were some type of British radar jamming material. He contacted the CAP who suggested that he collect some samples and notify FTD.

Mr. [redacted] returned to the scene, but a recent snow fall had concealed the foil for the time being. He said that it is starting to thaw now and he should be able to find some samples in the next day or two.

Mr. [redacted], a machinist, described the strips as being about 1/4 to 5/16 in. wide and 2½ to 3 in. long.

Thanked him for his report and advised him that report would be delivered to appropriate branch of FTD for action.
