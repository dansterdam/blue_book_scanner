10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Planet Venus was in a position coincident with that reported for UFO on 12 Nov 61. The obj was just rising near the effects of atmospheric refraction were probably reason for its identification and apparent radial motion of place. It was still quite dark since planet at 0518 and sun rise did not come up until 0620. Probable cause for witness assuming obj went over horizon and out of sight was beginning of sky lighting with approach of sunrise, weather conditions and loss of the effects associated with atmospheric refraction. Past that point was rising later each morning and position overcast sky would indicate that this obj was not planet Venus viewed under rather unusual circumstances.
