Dear Sir:

On Friday, July 2, at about 11:15 p.m. we watched an unusual object that resembled a star. It was alternately bright and dim, zigzagging several times and also appeared to hover. It seemed to pulsate or increase and decrease in size at times. We observed it for approximately 15 minutes.

During the time we observed it, the object moved in various directions - to the north, south, east and west, and then disappeared over the mountain.

The size of the object appeared to be about 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the moon, and it was about 65 miles north of us. The color was whitish.

We live in a mountainous area, and it was not any aircraft or conventional flying object that we are familiar with in this area.

Since we have been watching the newspapers in hopes of finding some explanation for what we saw, I am writing to ask if a similar object might be of interest to you.

Sincerely yours,
Mr. and Mrs. [redacted]
