The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a point labeled "A" and a curved object above the horizon line, illustrating how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger scene with a person standing on a road with a curved horizon line. The third sketch shows a smaller scene with a person standing on a hilltop with a curved horizon line.

Text transcription:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)
In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if needed.

The handwritten text describes the observer as a college graduate who had sighted an unusual object in the sky. The object was described as appearing metallic, reflecting sunlight, and making a "slight humming noise" as it moved. The observer followed the object for some distance before losing sight of it.

Text transcription:
They, it became much smaller - moving at great speed - flying around quite fast. It went straight up in a vertical position, then went back down and had time was 10:50 P.M. When we looked the object was gone.

It appeared to be a danger - field. Could not have been a meteor - thing seemed to go along sight of view - bottom was no tail - just the field - seemed circular - not circular light - something like an object - it started to shimmer - something seemed to go out of it - a clear night - no cloud.

Went to air field. Fearing something could have been bad - thing was over - this was an important part of our work - we had been in a state of alert practically the thing for more than ten minutes, than it disappeared.

J.V.S.

P.S. The thing gave sort of a orange color.

The image appears to be a diagram or illustration from a UFO report document. It shows a hemispherical dome or sphere with various compass directions and angle markings around the edges. There is a small silhouette figure in the center of the image, indicating some kind of reference point or scale. However, the image does not contain any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

Text extracted from the document:

I feel that he is telling me to go back, to get out.
information for my observation of what I saw.
I was looking out the window and I saw what appeared to me to be a large silver balloon or some object.
It appeared to be moving on a east-west heading and the rate of speed was slow but I may estimate it to be about 200 mph.
Sometime there was a dark halo or shadow around the object and from here it had the shape of a normal balloon.
As the object became smaller in the distance I lost sight of it after about 5 minutes of observation.
Thank you.

SA-01-34-/L col Tacker/mhb/72291

29 JULY 1960

Dear Mrs. -----,

Your letter dated 20 July 1960 concerning an unidentified flying object was addressed to President Eisenhower has been referred to this office.

Your letter contains insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore I am enclosing a U.S. Air Force questionnaire which should be filled out and sent to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their analysis and evaluation.

For your information I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheet which plainly states the Air Force's position regarding UFOs.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
