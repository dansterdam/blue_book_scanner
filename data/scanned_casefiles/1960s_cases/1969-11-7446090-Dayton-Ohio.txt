REFERENCE: CASE NO. 7446090
DATE: 7 NOV 69
LOCATION: DAYTON, OHIO
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
NARRATIVE: On 7 November 1969, at approximately 1910 hours, Mr. X reported sighting an unidentified object in the sky near his home in Dayton, Ohio. Mr. X described the object as being small, bright in color, and darting rapidly through the sky. He also stated that the object appeared to release smaller objects or "particles" which also moved around quickly. Mr. X made a rough sketch of the objects as he saw them. No other witnesses were reported.

EXCERPT FROM TEXT:

It is noted that witnesses saw a bright light in the sky as described. The object moved across the sky at a rapid speed, and suddenly changed direction to a slower moving course. The object appeared to be controlled in its movements and disappearance. No photographic evidence could be obtained. The case is classified as Unidentified.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

7 November 1969

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Dayton, Ohio, 6 November 1969

1. On 6 November 1969, at approximately 2145 hours, the writer accompanied by two other Air Force officers, observed a bright light in the southern sky over Dayton, Ohio. The light appeared to be hovering and occasionally changing intensity. After observing the light for approximately 15 minutes, it suddenly accelerated in a southeasterly direction and disappeared from sight.

2. The incident was reported to Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) and the local Air Force base (WPAFB). ADC controllers indicated that they had received numerous reports of the same object from the general public and local law enforcement agencies.

3. This report is being submitted for record purposes only. No further action is required on the part of this office.

REPORT.
Dayton, Ohio
November 7, 1969

Incident:
Radar targets of unknown origin were detected moving over the Dayton, Ohio area. 

Details:
On November 7, 1969 at approximately 1:15 AM EST, radar operators at WPAFB, Dayton, Ohio detected several unidentified targets on their scopes. The targets were moving rapidly and erratically over the Dayton area. Controllers attempted to make visual and radio contact with the targets, but were unsuccessful. The targets continued to move about the area for approximately 20 minutes before fading from the radar screens.

Evaluation:
The radar operators were experienced and the radar equipment was functioning properly. No explanation could be determined for the unidentified targets. Further investigation is warranted.

SUMMARY: This report describes an unidentified object or phenomenon observed by multiple witnesses in the skies over Dayton, Ohio on the evening of 7 November 1969. The object was described as bright, luminous, and moving erratically before eventually disappearing from view. Numerous attempts were made to identify the object, but no conclusive explanation was found.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES NOVEMBER 10-16, 1969

The maps on this publication are prepared under the direction of the Superintendent, Environmental Data Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The map stations are shown as black dots, and are labeled with the state abbreviations. The contours show the height above sea level of the 500-millibar pressure surfaces, which indicate the general weather patterns. The solid lines represent heights in tens of meters. The dashed lines show the thickness between the 1000- and 500-millibar surfaces, and are labeled in decameters. This information is used to analyze temperature, moisture, and wind patterns. 

The weather map series includes maps for 7:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time each day. The 7:00 A.M. maps show the weather conditions prevailing at the beginning of each 24-hour period, and the 7:00 P.M. maps show the conditions 12 hours later. Small black figures are printed on the maps to indicate the temperatures, winds, and other weather data observed at the map stations. These data are coded according to internationally recognized weather observing and reporting practices.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK  
This incident occurred during the early morning hours of November 7, 1969, at approximately 2:00 a.m. local time, near Dayton, Ohio.  
The witness, a civilian individual, observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be approaching his location. The light rapidly increased in size and brightness, and the witness was able to observe it for approximately five minutes before it disappeared from view.  
No other individuals were reported to have observed this incident. There is no physical evidence or photographic documentation available regarding this particular sighting.  
The investigation conducted by Project Blue Book personnel was unable to determine the exact nature or origin of the light observed by the witness. The case was classified as "unidentified" due to the lack of definitive evidence.
