NO FLYING, SHAW AFB SC CALLED SHAW AFB AT 0912 AM LOCAL. OPERATIONS
STATED THEY WERE FLYING FROM 1900 LOCAL LAST NIGHT ALL NIGHT, THAT
SOME FLIGHTS OVERFLEW THE AIKEN AND COLUMBIA AREA. PRELIMINARY
ANALYSIS: THAT THE OBSERVER IS NOT A RELIABLE WITNESS, THAT NO
PAGE 4 RUCLEDX0008 UNCLAS
UFO'S WERE SIGHTED, THAT INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE
FROM OBSERVER, THAT OBSERVER WAS RELUCTANT TO GIVE NEEDED INFO
SUCH AS HOME PHONE, PARENTS NAME, DIRECTION OF FLIGHT, AND EXP
PERIENCE IN OBSERVING AERIAL PHENOMENON, THAT THE SIGHTED OBJECTS
WERE CONVENTIONAL JET AIRCRAFT, THAT THE REASON FOR NO SOUND WAS
BECAUSE OF THE HEIGHT OF THE JETS, I CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS NOT A
VALID UFO SIGHTING BUT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT AND THAT NO FURTHER
INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED.
