MEMO FOR THE RECORD: CONVERSATION WITH CAPT REICHMUTH, 23D regarding photos of _____. He will try to stick the photos, the Marines reports and a few comments in an envelope this afternoon. He had spoke to Mr. _____ for approximately 13 hours last Thursday, 24 September 1965. The Marines had contacted Mr. _____ and returned the original pictures to Mr. _____. Supposedly NORAD and being contacted him the day after the photos appeared in the newspaper. He said that he appeared to be on the up and up. A gentleman from NORAD with credentials had visited Mr. _____ regarding the photographs. Mr. _____ gave the originals to this man without any receipt. He had given them to the Marines without any receipt and gotten them back no figured he would do the same to NORAD, said if he got them back he would give them to Capt Reichmuth without a receipt also. SAFOI and Capt Reichmuth have tried to find out who this gentleman from NORAD was. So far nobody knows. A person from the NPIC of St Louis had called Mr. _____ regarding photos. The reason they were upset about the releases was that some estimates given by the photo people at SGD were that the object was maybe 5-6ft in diameter or 30-60 ft in diameter. One photo the man was sitting in a truck. They are sending all the measurements of the truck etc with the photos. The photo lab was unable to do a good analysis or take anytime because of a job they were working on.

NARRATIVE REPORT AND ASSESSMENT

UFO, 3 AUGUST 1965, SANTA ANA, CALIFORNIA

1. The following is based upon investigation conducted personally by the Investigating Officer from our commands and various witnesses obtained from civilian complainants, and is a summary of the details obtained:

At approximately 1330 hours on 3 August 1965, the UFO was described as hovering over La Mirada and Cerritos, California. This UFO was sighted by numerous individuals, and was observed by these individuals to be a large, ovated-shaped object, metallic in appearance, that hovered in the sky for several minutes. The UFO was then observed to make a rapid departure to the southeast, at a high rate of speed. Several civilian witnesses had attempted to use their radios to alert the Air Force, and others had immediately notified the Orange County Sheriff's Office, who in turn notified the appropriate Air Force agency. An immediate on-scene investigation was instituted, and the following details were obtained:

The UFO was described as being approximately 50-60 feet in diameter, metallic in appearance, and was observed to hover in the sky for several minutes before making a rapid departure to the southeast. Several civilian witnesses were interviewed, and sketches were obtained depicting the object as observed. The exact altitude, as estimated by the witnesses, varied from 500-1000 feet. It was further established that the object made no noise, and emitted no visible exhaust or contrails. The object was observed by numerous individuals to be a solid, metallic, ovated-shaped craft, and its rapid departure was observed by all witnesses.

Marine Corps Investigators estimate that the sighting of the UFO as described by the various witnesses would tend to indicate a highly advanced and sophisticated aerial vehicle, the performance characteristics of which are beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft.

Based on the image, there does not appear to be any photograph present. The image shows a typed document that appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report.

Proceeding with the text extraction from the document:

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
It was reported that a civilian who was entering the vicinity of the UFO, in an attempt to photograph it, was waved away by the military guard. This appeared to be in keeping with standard military security precautions. It turned out that the military would not allow close photography of the UFO.

The sighting of individuals at the location of the landed object was widely observed by numerous people in the area. However, the report indicates these witnesses were apparently not able to approach or photograph the object at close range.

The report mentions that after the sighting, the object "disappeared into the haze". No photographs of the object itself are included in this document.

G. As the end of the working day, Mr D. returned to his office and prepared to depart. He was subsequently interviewed and provided the following information:

On the evening of 7 August 1965, Mr D. received a telephone call from a person who claimed to have seen a landed UFO in the Santa Ana area of California. The caller stated that the object was visible and that he had taken some photographs of it. The caller then asked Mr D. to come to the location to verify the sighting and obtain copies of the photographs.

Mr D. indicated that he was interested in the report and agreed to go to the location. When he arrived, he found a group of individuals who had also responded to the call and were waiting at the site. However, Mr D. was subsequently informed by military personnel that he would not be allowed to approach the UFO or obtain photographs, as the area was under military control and closed to the public.

The report indicates that the photographs taken by the initial caller were eventually forwarded to the main office in New York, but no further details are provided about their contents or disposition.

Mr. ******** states that at no time did he actually agree to the appearance or disappearance of what is described as a sighting of a strange object. He also stated that he wished it had never happened.
On 23 September 1965, the Air Force Office at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station received what the photographic office advised and contacted Mr. **********, the witness, to gain his statement in regard to the sighting.
He stated that following the publication of the two newspaper reports, describing his home calls and the bomb threat, he also received two additional follow-up calls telling him that another report would be sent to him, but he did not receive any additional reports. According to ********, he was told that his statement was requested in order to clarify any doubts the Air Force might have about the matter.
The report states that Mr. ********** was concerned about all of the phone calls for various reasons. Although he *************** had been mentioned in the press release, he was concerned that his name and address had become known. The number involved is limited.
The report goes on to say that two original prints of the photography from the case, along with the photographic negatives, were retained upon the request of the Air Force. The photographic experts, without hesitation, stated that the prints were considered authentic and that no evidence of double exposure or any other attempt to alter the photography was found.
According to the 23 September a man in civilian clothing visited his house, claimed an identification card, and announced he was "Major Andrews" of the Air Force. This individual provided certain details about the sighting that *********** claimed were not accurate. **********'s wife was present during this interview. *********** stated that he requested that the Air Force personnel not tape record their conversation, and they complied.
This report states that to date no other information has been received by the Air Force regarding this matter, and the case is still under investigation.

that he would eventually get the pictures back. He told the investigator that the officer that he would forward the photographs to AOD when they were developed.
Actually, the investigating officer was not able to contact ——————, who allegedly has the pictures, in order to
obtain them. The officer reported that ——————— could not be located.

It was also determined that following the UFO press release, the Road Department was flooded with telephone calls from all over the United States, and records indicate that calls came in requesting information on the sighting and at——————
1. That Mr. ——————— keep his vehicle radio off so that his daily duties would not be interrupted.
2. That his telephone number would be given out to all callers between the hours of 8:30 A.M. and 5:30 P.M.
3. That in certain instances, appointments would be made with the callers at his residence during evening hours.

It was indicated that the information given to the public and identified himself again as a public representative, the information that in the event that the media or the public desired additional or related official information, they would attempt to do so to avoid that he would not talk to them. A subsequent check showed this man did act authorized.

Please do the investigating officer's conversations with Mr. —————— all appear to confirm the circumstances as
all aspects of the report. Results appear to corroborate what was determined should therefore be considered valid, credible ad consistent.
However, the basic story contained for examination. It is believed

that the assertions in its statements were due to both or
the following reasons:

a. The Marine Corps investigation was generally cursory while this investigation focused on collecting considerable information and data after the incident. 

b. That it was a genuine attempt by the officers of the detachment to provide as much informa-
tion as possible in the absence of any data on which to evaluate a satisfactory number of specific details which had been observed some months previously.
It is considered probable that although the witness was quite articulate in his statements, his observations did ·not warrant the conclusions which are discussed in great detail. In other words, the conclusions put forth by all of the people who have been involved with this matter as to the possible nature of the detachment's encounter do not appear to be in consonance with his actual observations which were of a limited nature.

Prior to the contact with the Senior SACTO, the investigators had been instructed not to issue a final opinion,  since the details covering this incident were still under investigation. Later on, however, I noted that a minor was used by stating that he had personally interviewed the witness, and that he had been quite successful in eliciting additional pertinent details from the witness - this cannot be supported, since no one other than this investigator had. actually made contact with the witness, and it is doubtful whether any additional investigating or inquiry or acting as though he had been caught in any inconsistencies occurred.

a. That this was quite interesting, since a man from North American Aviation Missile Division (who had spoken as a controller on the photography) had called them to say that this is was only about four feet in diameter.

Newsman Martin, one of Los Angeles' most respected flying saucer observers, says a "flying platform" was witnessed here Saturday night. It was 30 to 40 feet across and appeared about 10 feet thick. It made no noise, the newsman said, and did not change shape or size. The driver, Martin said, was near Martin and appeared to be taking photographs through a (sic) window, but as Martin approached him, the driver quickly closed the "window" and the platform disappeared. Martin and others also saw a large cat or dog-like creature on the platform. Martin said he tried to photograph it, but was unable to do so. The man said he was sure the platform was not an airplane or any conventional craft, and that it was hovering at least 150 feet above the ground. "The driver was as startled to see us as we were to see him," Martin reported. "He slammed the 'window' closed and the platform disappeared immediately."

Air Saucer Mystery
Sighting Story
By TOM NEWTON

Controversy continued for third day on case of unidentified flying object seen by three military men at Santa Ana Air Facility.

Pacific Tele. & Tel. Co. employe told The Herald reporter he was driving along Edinger ave. near the base at 1:45 a.m. Aug. 3 when he saw a huge, glowing oval object hovering about 1000 feet above the ground. He said it was about 100 feet in diameter, and about the size of a large jet plane. 

"It made no sound," he said.

The incident was reported to the Highway Patrol and the Santa Ana Air Facility. An Air Force spokesman said they were investigating the incident.

The image appears to contain a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The text below the image refers to it as a "UFO Photo Released" and provides some details about the sighting, which occurred in Santa Ana, California. The text also mentions that some people don't believe in flying saucers, but this photograph is being released as evidence of such an object.

Text extracted from the document:

UFO Photo Released

SANTA ANA, Calif. (UPI) - Flooded with reports of unidentified objects in the skies, the California highway department is investigating a picture it says was taken of a flying saucer. The official said the picture was taken by a highway department employee who was working near Santa Ana. The object photographed appears to be a saucer-like object that has yet to be identified. Three photographs which have been distributed to wire services around the nation were released today.

A Flying Saucer?

Some people don't believe in flying saucers, but what is this picture?

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather it is a page from an old document from Project Blue Book, a former U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text reads as follows:

METROPOLITAN ORANGE COUNTY'S WATCHFUL NEWSPAPER
SANTA ANA, ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA SUNDAY SEPTEMBER 26, 1965
  
AIR LAUNCHES FULL PROBE OF COUNTY UFO
By FRANK HALL AND BILL FAIR

Experts are investigating to determine if the aerial object photographed over Santa Ana last Monday's edition was a "flying saucer." 

The captain of the Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official investigative unit, has said the object photographed was an "unidentified flying object" and that a preliminary analysis indicates it may be a "mysterious and unusual aerial phenomenon."

He said initial investigations of the UFO sighting have revealed the object was a "minimum of 15 feet in diameter and 5 feet thick" and was traveling at "an estimated speed of 500 miles per hour."

Three pictures of the "purported flying saucer" taken by Helio Caetano of Santa Ana and the Santa Ana Register, were published in last Monday's edition.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 65-118
SUBJECT: UFO Report
LOCATION: Santa Ana, California
DATE: 3 August 1965

PHOTOGRAPHY
P NO: 1-2 AXIO Prints & Investigating Reports

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to work order No. 65-106 submitted by Major Quintonilla, Jr. (TDEW/UFO) requesting photo analysis of attached three photographs showing alleged unidentified flying objects. The following analysis was conducted from these photographs.

2. ANALYSIS: Although it is not possible to disprove the existence of the objects from the camera information submitted and distances to the object quoted in the report by Mr. M, on a set of negatives examined the following was determined by Mr. M. Those objects were in approximately the same part of the frame in all three photographs. The center white stripe on the road and the object appeared to have the same sharp image. Therefore, it is felt that the object was on the same plane as the center white stripe of the road as a factor, it was estimated the size of the object to be approximately one to three feet in diameter and the distance to the object to be approximately 20 feet above the ground.

3. A test was conducted by the FTD Photo Analyst and Photo processing personnel with the identical camera (1.10A using 200 ASA film - Focal length 129mm, Aperture f.32 at 1/300 second) and on a distance conveying tray, placed in the approximately 8 to 12 feet high at a distance from the camera of approximately 20 feet. The results of this test photography showed surprising similarities between the object on the test photography and the object on Mr. M's photography.

The image appears to show a photograph of a landscape, possibly a body of water or a shoreline. There is a dark object or shape visible in the sky, which could potentially be a flying object. However, the image quality is quite poor, so it is difficult to discern any details or identify the object with certainty.

The image contains a black and white photograph showing a blurry, hazy image of what appears to be an unidentified aerial object. The caption below the image states: "PICTURE taken Aug 2 near Santa Ana, Calif. Marine Corps Air Facility shows swarm-shaped object. Photo was taken by fire fighters, reportedly 15 feet off the ground.".

Following is the text from the document, which appears to be a Project Blue Book report:

PICTURE taken Aug 2 near Santa Ana, Calif. Marine Corps Air Facility shows swarm-shaped object. Photo was taken by fire fighters, reportedly 15 feet off the ground.

Highway department investigators, about time numerous UFO sightings were reported in area, and has just been released.

The image does not contain a photograph. The document appears to be a typed report from Project Blue Book describing a UFO sighting in Santa Ana, California on August 22. The key details mentioned in the text are:

FLYING OBJECT CAUGHT ON FILM IN CALIFORNIA: On August 22nd, a county highway patrol officer photographed a UFO which was flying near the Marine Corps Air Force facility. The object was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and 8 to 10 feet thick. It was in sight for only about 15 seconds. 

The witness also stated that he tried to communicate by two-way radio with his superiors but was found the radio inoperative, possibly due to electromagnetic disturbances caused by the presence of the UFO.

At least one other sighting was made in the vicinity of the Marine base on the same day as the incident described in the report.

The image contains a photograph analysis report from Project Blue Book regarding a UFO sighting in Santa Ana, California on August 9, 1965. The report includes a description of the photographic evidence, which consisted of 3 8x10 prints showing an alleged unidentified flying object. The analysis indicates that the object was approximately 1 to 3 feet in diameter and 15 to 20 feet above the ground. The photographs were taken with a Polaroid camera from a distance of 15 feet, and the object seen in the photographs was 9 inches in diameter.

Transcribed text from the document:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT N0 65-43

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT
LOCATION: Santa Ana, California
PHOTOGRAPHY DATE: 9 August 1965

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to work order No. 65-106 submitted by Major OISW/USAF) requesting photo analysis of attached three photographs showing alleged unidentified flying object.

2. ANALYSIS: Although it is not possible to determine size of the object from the camera distortion, we can see the following is the true case. The camera was probably focused on a set distance and when an infinity object is photographed on close distance, the object will appear smaller than it is. Therefore, it is felt that the object was on the same plane as the center white strips or clouds to the right side. This would mean the object was between one to three feet in diameter and approximately fifteen to twenty feet above the ground.

The results shown on the attached photographs. The photographs were taken with a Polaroid Camera, Model 100, using 3000 ASA film, aperture F32 at 1/500th of a second, focused on a distance of 15 feet. The object seen in the photographs was a 9' in diameter vapor/curiosity roughly 12 feet high at a distance from the photographer that remained constant between the object on the test photography and the object on Mr. XXXXX photography.

OCR Output:

CAN YOU BELIEVE THE CAMERA EYE?
SANTA ANA, Calif. Sept. 3 - Rex Hefline, 38, an airplane pilot, claims to have photographed two "flying saucers" that passed over his home here Saturday evening. On Aug. 31, Hefline was out in his backyard taking pictures of the sky when he says he noticed the two objects about 8:35 p.m. He says the objects were visible for 15 seconds and that he took two pictures of them with his camera before they disappeared. Hefline says the objects were oval and disc-shaped and were flying in a northeast direction. He says the objects were traveling at a rapid rate of speed. Hefline says he does not believe in flying saucers, but that he has the pictures as evidence and "if you don't believe me, you can see it for yourself." U.T.
