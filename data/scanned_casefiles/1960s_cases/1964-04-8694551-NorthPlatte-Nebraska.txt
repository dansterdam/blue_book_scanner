Dear Lisa,

I am twelve years old and I am studying sixth grade. I am very interested in your line of work. I'm writing to try to find out some information concerning the incident in New Mexico where the Plated Man claimed to see a flying saucer. I know you must have experience in these cases but I would appreciate it very much. Saturday April 25, a friend and I were looking through my telescope. We spotted something going across the sky terribly fast. I tried to get the telescope on it but had trouble doing so because of its tremendous speed but did manage to get a couple good glimpses at it, under the telescope it looked like a meter or two comet but about fifteen minutes later it came back across. When I first sighted it, it was going northeast across the sky and when I saw it again it was traveling south east through my telescope the object appeared to be red with trailing lines something like this.

[There are two small sketches at the bottom of the page, one appears to be a trailing object]
