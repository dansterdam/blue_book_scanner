The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved shape in the sky above the horizon, with the instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate where the object was first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it.

The second sketch shows a broader landscape view, with instructions to place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and to refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the drawing.

As an OCR system, the text extracted from the document is:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the sketch.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document describing a sighting that occurred on June 12, 1963 in Xenia, Ohio.

UFO Sighting phoned in at 1300 on 12 June 1963
Time/Date of sighting: 2310 local, 12 June 1963
Location: West edge of Xenia (Lanewood Housing Development)
Observer: Xenia, Ohio
ASI 23177
Observer was lying on a chase lounge in the backyard of his home (facing toward the West) and looking straight up when he observed the object. At first it appeared to be a jet plane progressing to the right toward the position of three stars (the constellation Cygnus?) The object then began a series of oscillating movements, climbing progressively to the right toward the position of three stars. This climbing motion continued for about 15 to 20 seconds. About 15 to 20 flashes of blue-white light streamed out meteor and flashing seemed to be high in sky and moved at a rapid speed.
"Phenomenal" (no sound) could be seen, scattered clouds.
