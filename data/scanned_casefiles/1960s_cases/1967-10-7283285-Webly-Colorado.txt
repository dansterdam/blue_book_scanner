P.O. Box, Colorado 80420

Reference your message UFOP GODOG COCT 67, on an unidentified
flying object observation of 01002/20 Oct 67. Your paragraph 1
indicated that [redacted] also observed the same object as "a
[redacted] phenomenon". Assumption then the two witnesses
[illegible text] not agree on the object.

a. That led your office to believe that both observers were
seeing the same UFO.

b. Due to discrepancies in the information from the witnesses
and your report, we request you forward the initial reports that your
office received from both witnesses. This information is necessary
prior to our offices making an evaluation.
