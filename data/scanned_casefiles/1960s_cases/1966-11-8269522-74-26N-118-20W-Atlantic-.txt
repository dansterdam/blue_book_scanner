901st Air Refueling Squadron
Columbus AFB, Mississippi 39701
18 March 1967

Dear Colonel Freeman:

I apologize for not replying to your letter sooner, however, I am on an extended TDY and your letter just caught up with me.

I would like to clarify a couple of points relating to my observation on November 8, 1966. I was told by the debriefing officer immediately after the incident that I was not submitting a UFO report but rather an unusual Incident Report. I was in full agreement with this and was not aware that I had submitted a UFO report until I received your correspondence. Someone apparently changed this without my knowledge.

I agree fully with your conclusion that aircraft could have been responsible for this observation. This was my stated opinion to the debriefing officer. I stated that I believed this observation to be two small aircraft in formation.

I hope this will clear up any questions you may have regarding this observation.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
Charles W. Bond
Captain, USAF
