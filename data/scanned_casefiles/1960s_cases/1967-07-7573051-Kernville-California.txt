PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 30 or 31 Jul 67

2. LOCATION: Kernville, California

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 2

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 75 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

7. COURSE: SE

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: (CONFLICTING DATA)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer sighted a bright yellow light in the sky and seemed about twice as large as the largest visible star. Later another light seemed to appear and looked as though it was trying to steer the first on a definite course.

Comments: Edwards rapcon was contacted at the time of the sighting. The only thing they painted was a target that was travelling about 100 knots and was believed to have been a travelling aircraft. The observer indicated they were sighting on 31 Jul but the original twx indicated that it occurred on 30 Jul. Dr. Hynek stated that it did not appear profitable to pursue the investigation of the case any further.

1. Reference your letter dated 3 August 1967, subject as above. The following information is further submitted concerning a possible UFO observation in the area of Kernville, California on 30 July 1967.

a. Mr. Buckley, a representative of the Edwards FAA Rapcon relayed the following facts:

(1) FPS-35 radar equipment was used.
(2) No scope photographs were taken.
(3) An intercept was not made or requested by Edwards Rapcon.
(4) On the date of the observation, the Edwards Rapcon controller received a call from China Lake that an unknown object was sighted over Walker Pass. Edwards Rapcon could observe a target on the FPS-35 scope at that time. The target was not estimated to be traveling about 100 knots. Edwards Rapcon could not correlate this information to a UFO since the route of the object was within an area frequently used by light aircraft.

2. Mr. Buckley, Edwards Rapcon, can be contacted directly if further information is required by calling Edwards AFB by AUTOVON 898-1550, ext 73843.

1.   There is nothing in the data supplied by Mr. [redacted] indicate that he had been observing an astronomical body. Saturn had not quite risen at the time of his first observation. Further, he indicated the elevation as being approximately half-way to the zenith.

2.   From the evidence presented by Mr. [redacted] it does not appear potentially profitable to pursue investigation of this case further, as the likelihood of obtaining anything of scientific value from this sighting seems improbable. This sighting takes its place with hundreds of others which end in a blind alley and yield nothing of scientific value.

1. The Aerial Phenomena Branch is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting for 31 July 1967, from Kernville, California. The observer first saw the object, which appeared as a light, in the course at approximately 1015 PM, at an angle of about 65 degrees. Later, another light appeared beside the first. The object disappeared at 11:30 PM in the southwest, at approximately 50 degrees above the horizon.

2. Request information on any balloon launches from your base that may have been the cause for this sighting. We have no traffic on your radar scope at the time of the sighting?
