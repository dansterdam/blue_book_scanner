Memo for the Record:  16 Aug 67

There are no available records of air activity in the area. The person who took the report estimated the reliability of the individual as poor but this was changed to reliable. Major Brown indicated that the object was probably an aircraft. He suggested that we contact Ft. Carson because they are often engaged in night time operations involving the dropping of flares.

I am a member of NICAP, and so I always keep an eye out for UFO's when out at night.

This object looked just like any bright star, except that it moved, and then stopped. It then returned in the same direction that it had come.

My wife and I had just finished eating a late dinner at Shank Detour, a small town east of Dijon, Ill.

We were in our car halfway between these two towns, in open country, when I saw this "light". I stopped the car and we watched it for a few

"Thousands See
UFOs Flashing
Over Europe"

WIESBADEN, Germany - (UP) - Cigar-shaped unidentified flying objects (UFOs), trailing brilliant light and looking like "fireworks" startled tens of thousands of northern Europeans yesterday.

The UFOs flashed across the skies over Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and Luxembourg.

The U.S. Air Force said the brilliant heavenly phenomenon were sighted by its personnel at three air bases in Germany. None of the "objects" was picked up on radar screens.

A spokesman at U.S. Air Force Europe (USAFE) headquarters in Wiesbaden said the UFOs were "spotted shortly after midnight and flames coming out of them."

The pilot of a chartered aircraft said he saw "a very brilliant object" at 2:00 am while he was approaching Zurich airport for a landing.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
[Handwritten response appears to be illegible]

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)   Yes   [x] No   Don't know.   If you answered YES, then tell who
it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)   Yes   [x] No   Don't know.   If you answered YES, then tell who
in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: humming or pattering
b. Color: dark light blue or light normal

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
about 15x 10' great

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
