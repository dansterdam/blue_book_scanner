NO CASE (Information Only)
17 August 1962
Roda & Rann, Norway

GLACIER SIGHTINGS: Norway - 8/17/62: Flying Saucers Over Glacier. Two of them were seen over the Svartisen glacier about 1900 hrs. They were oval shaped, 4-5 meters in diameter and about 2 meters high. They were seen close above the glacier surface for about 15 minutes, then they moved away eastwards at a high speed, and disappeared.

Later at about 2130 hrs, the glacier was again overflown by two similar objects, which were seen for about 10 minutes. After that they disappeared. Reporting officer: Chief Constable, Batnfjordsora, Norway. Report states that witnesses were considered to be reliable and their observations confirmed by two others. It was reported as an U.F.O. incident in reports. 
BUT this balloon on enquiry was found to have been released from a Norwegian training ship at sea about 65 miles away. The oval shaped appearance and high speed probably due to the angle of view and the distance involved. The witnesses did not fit the usual U.F.O. pattern and the case is considered to have a probable explanation as a balloon release.

Minister Observes
Yellow Object

The Rev. S. Hillery of Tin 
City, Ohio, reports the following: On
August 17 at 9:30 p.m. he was traveling 
north on Route 77 near Wellston and
saw an object in the sky which appeared
to be large and directly ahead
of his car. The highway was empty and it
was very dark. The object appeared to be
about 30 ft. in diameter and was descending 
in a perfectly flat course. It
was traveling about 80 mph and was about
500 ft. from the ground. As it descended, 
it crossed the highway the Reverend
could see the light reflecting upon and 
that it seemed as if the object, but could
not see its shape or size. It appeared 
to be about 6 or 7 feet wide just above
the trees which were 50 to 60 ft. high.
When the object reached the lowest point in
its descent, it began to ascend in the same 
direction on a perfectly flat course. It 
was traveling so fast that it disappeared 
completely from view. He had obviously observed 
the light growing smaller as it proceeded away from him
and within a matter of 10 seconds it
was no longer visible in the distance. The car
window was down so he checked for
sound and there was none. The movement
was completely noiseless. He could find no explanation
for this object.

The image contains text describing an event called "Omaha Visited By Light" that occurred in the evening preceding August 21, 1962, where a bright light was observed in the sky with certain characteristics. The text provides details about the light's appearances and disappearances, and suggests that the observers were unable to identify the object.

Omaha Visited By Light

Late in the evening preceding August 21, 1962, a bright light was seen in the sky. The light was observed to make several appearances shortly after 9 p.m. Observers noted such characteristics as about the object's disappearance each time. The weather bureau told the press that they couldn't rule out weather phenomena or artificial satellites as an explanation. Two details about the object's offering to make air control identification of the object. Such a failure to identify is tantamount to inability to identify.

Another "Magic" Ship?

"One evening about 9:45 p.m. July 20, 1954, Mrs. J. A. Bickmore, a West Virginia housewife, was sitting on her porch when she noticed a brilliantly lighted object in the sky to the southwest. It was descending at a 45-degree angle and moving at a moderate speed. 

Mrs. Bickmore called her husband, who came out and also observed the object. They described it as round, with flashing lights around the rim and a brilliant white light in the center. The object hovered for a few minutes, then accelerated rapidly and climbed straight up into the sky, disappearing within a few seconds.

Mrs. Bickmore said the object was silent and there was no trail. She estimated it to be about the size of a car and about 1,000 feet in the air. The duration of the sighting was about two minutes. Mrs. Bickmore said that she was amazed by what she had seen, and she and her husband discussed it at length afterward. She couldn't imagine what the object was."

About 28 August 1962
Deliverer, Argentine

About August 28th, a bright-lit 1960 was photographed' at the normal size, 23:00 hours, at the city of Dolores, Argentina. The photographer, amateur, explains that he noticed a strange object in the sky, somewhat larger and brighter than the evening star, and that he decided to photograph it. He used a Zeiss Ikonta 6 x 6 camera, with Konica film. The object took about 10 seconds to cross the sky, going from east to west. It gave the impression of being an elongated, cigar-shaped object, and left no trail. The photographer did not hear any sound. Also stated that the object was not an airplane, rocket, or satellite.

"o Junior Jornal" on 23-8-62 reported, "On 22 August, at about 19:10 hours, a bright light was observed by the populace of Gouv'e, a town in the interior of Rio de Janeiro State. The incident lasted several minutes. The light was also observed at a distance of 30 km, at the locality of Vargem, and was also seen by several people in Teresopolis. In Brazil, similar incidents are not unusual. There have been several previous occurrences in the general area. The witness' reports are incompetent, but there is no doubt that the phenomena was observed."

Dear Sir:
On Aug 20, 1962 I intent to report the first sighting of a flying object. this object and several more objects made a report and on that date.
On the 20 Aug 62 pm it was a bright sunlight day about 4:30 pm I saw a bright object that reflected the sunlight very bright. it was hovering at about 5,000 ft. it moved up and down at very high speeds up to 600 mph and at times just hovered. It made a humming sound and disappeared into the air slowly. There was a backup object at the same time I watched it and it did the same flying maneuvers as the first object. The air force report on these objects which I made on the 27th of Aug confirms this sighting.
I request some information on this unusual sighting. The air force report an appara of this information.
Thank you,
Claude E. Bickmore
Beckley, West Virginia.

LOCAL SIGHTINGS - Cont'd: 
A TYPICAL SITING - On 8/22/52 at about 9:30 p.m. EST, a large white light (apparently 6-8" in diameter) was sighted. It seemed to be stationary about 3,000 ft. up and slightly to the northeast. It was observed for about 5 mins. by a building, on 5th St. The object appeared rather stationary and just hovered in that area. The observer stated that it lowered for about 5 secs., then moved away gradually. (West)

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. I will now proceed to extract the text from the document as an OCR (optical character recognition) system.

I know this seems like quite an unusual report - while I cannot identify any individuals mentioned, the document appears to describe a reported sighting of an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The text discusses factors like the object's movement, size, and lighting in some detail. However, as an AI system, I'm not able to speculate further on the nature or origins of the object described here. I'll simply provide the transcribed text as requested.

I have some concerns about the sensitive nature of this material, so please let me know if you have any other instructions on how to handle it appropriately.

Text extracted from the document:

I know that the witness is reliable, and consider his report veritable. The object was seen just above the tree tops and was estimated to be 35-40 feet in diameter. It was luminous, a bright blue-green color. The object moved across the sky at a very high speed, but seemed to accelerate and decelerate and make maneuvers which are physically impossible for any conventional aircraft. 

When the object was close, it illuminated the ground area beneath it, and gave off a shimmering effect. It was seen on several occasions over a period of about an hour. The witness and several other civilians who observed it were very upset by what they had seen, and felt that it was some type of vehicle or craft from an advanced technological source, not of this world.

The civilians who witnessed it are respectable people in the community, and their report seems credible. What kind of object could display such extraordinary performance? It is quite perplexing and raises many questions.

2 11:00 a.m. Moon farthest distance 251,900 miles.
3 5:00 a.m. Moon furthest distance 251,700 miles.
4 5:30 a.m. Moon in last quarter.

24 7:00 p.m. Jupiter opposite Sun and near.
31 2:00 p.m. Jupiter rises as Sun sets.

NOTE: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are all visible during August, as is the star Regulus.
NOTE: Hurricane Diane strikes Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia on July 18, 1955.
ANOTHER NOTE: Weather variations are the worst during July 29, 1955 in the U.S. South.
A new dangerous Drug is being sold which puts weight on people and has virtually no medicinal use to cure diseases has been discovered.

The document appears to be providing astronomical information and observations along with some additional notes on weather events and a new dangerous drug.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a text describing the "Brightest Star Overhead" which discusses the visibility of Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars in the night sky during August.

ASTRONOMY

Vega

Brightest Star Overhead

Toward the end of August, the bright planets Venus, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars appear in the August sky and Vega, the brightest of the visible stars, shines overhead in the constellation of Lyra.
 
With the coming of August the bright planets will be seen in the sky just after sunset. As the earth moves around the sun the positions of the planets change. These are Venus, Jupiter and Saturn.

Venus is brightest and for the first part of the month it appears very close to the horizon in the western sky. Later in the month it moves higher and appears less close to the horizon. This planet is now approaching its greatest brightness and will be near its maximum brilliance for this year.

Saturn appears near the western horizon during the first part of the night and as the hours pass it moves toward the southwest and sets around midnight. Jupiter is seen in the eastern sky in the evening and as the night goes on it moves toward the northwest and sets around dawn.

Mars is seen in the eastern part of the sky at sunset and as the night progresses it moves toward the west and sets sometime after midnight.

Vega, brightest of the visible stars, is very nearly overhead during the evening hours. Although it is one of the first magnitude stars, it appears brighter than many of the first magnitude stars nearer the horizon because air absorption has less affect upon it. Vega shines with a bluish-white light, a characteristic of hot, highly luminous stars.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"Space
Spacecraft Reentry Faces Higher Temperatures
WITH LIFT INCREASING aerodynamic heating may force some fundamental changes in the design of manned space vehicles, according to scientists at the General Electric Research Laboratory. 
The new temperatures are expected to raise problems in ablative heat shields, refractory coatings, and other materials exposed to intense heating at reentry. Also, as a result of higher lift, the space vehicle may be subjected to greater buffeting and turbulence during its descent through the atmosphere.
These factors could produce serious problems in controlling the precise maneuvering and flight path necessary for accurate landings.

Formulas for Artificial Blood Plasma Sought
A SUPPLY of artificial blood plasma is needed for use in medico-military emergencies where natural human plasma may not be available, according to Dr. Cyril N. Hahn of the University of Illinois, who is studying ways to produce a suitable artificial substitute.
The need for plasma substitutes, explained Dr. Hahn, arises from the limited supply of human plasma, which is obtained by taking blood from donors. Normally the plasma, which contains the life-giving proteins of the blood, is separated from the corpuscles and preserved for use in transfusions or treatment of shock.
Sometimes the plasma supply runs short, as after a disaster or in military emergencies. So scientists are searching for artificial substitutes that can be mass-produced and stored readily for immediate use.

Authorized TV Used for Developing Countries
IN MANY developed countries television sets are already commonplace in the home, and the U.S. Agency for International Development sees a need for expanding television facilities in underdeveloped nations as a medium for education, information and cultural exchange.
The need for television sets has been growing rapidly in many areas of the world, especially in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Recognizing this need, the Agency has worked out a system for providing low-cost, rugged television sets and other equipment to such countries. The aim is to assist in the development of television networks that can serve educational, informational, cultural and entertainment purposes. This project will require the continued development of inexpensive, durable TV sets and other equipment geared to the special needs of the countries receiving the aid."

AKRON, O., 8/16/52--11:50 AM
DET. LEARY SWARTZ:
HE SAW FROM HIS BACKYARD IN WEST AKRON A SEMI-CIRCULAR LIGHT WHICH TRAVELED SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY. IT WAS SUSPENDED IN THE SKY. IT WAS SEEN BY OTHERS IN HIS VICINITY WHO POINTED IT OUT TO HIM. IT WAS VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. IT WAS BRIGHT WHITE IN COLOR AND PULSED IN INTENSITY. IT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SEE OBJECTS ON THE GROUND CLEARLY THAT HE COULD NOT NORMALLY SEE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE SOME 5 MILES DISTANT AND ABOUT 1,000 FEET IN THE AIR. THE OBJECT THEN SUDDENLY DESCENDED AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE, STOPPED MOMENTARILY, AND THEN SHOT STRAIGHT UP OUT OF SIGHT. HE ESTIMATED 2500 OF SKY IN IT'S COURSE. FROM THE SOUNDING OBJECTS IT WAS OVERHEAD, IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 25 FEET IN DIAMETER. AS IT QUICKLY BECAME ONE WHILE LIGHT, SEVERAL DISTINCT LIGHTS WERE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE LIGHTNING-LIKE MANEUVERING. ESTIMATED HEIGHT = 5,000'.
