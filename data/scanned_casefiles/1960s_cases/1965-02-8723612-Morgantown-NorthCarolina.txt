Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is in reply to your recent letter requesting information on unidentified flying objects.

The current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects, is attached for your information. This report contains information on the program since its origin in 1948.

You will be interested to know that the causes of the recent UFO sightings in Virginia are attributed to a misinterpretation of natural or conventional objects. Examples of this are research and weather balloons, aircraft and/or aircraft lights, meteors, and satellites.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING

Dear Hunter:

I have been studying in Astronomy for quite a while. Last night Saturday 3rd just in night I spotted four at different intervals within 30 min. I was finding and rising, and one was very bright and large. Things were moving very fast. They would fade out & disappear. I would like information on the Virginia saucer being seen right now and report and all the information you can send me.

Most of these things were coming from 10 to 13. The largest had a gait streak like behind it and a kind of snort.

Sincerely Yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]
