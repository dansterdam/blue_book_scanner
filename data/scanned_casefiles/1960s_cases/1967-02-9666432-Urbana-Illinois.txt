STATEMENT REGARDING SIGHTING OF A FLYING OBJECT ON FEBRUARY 25, 1967

At 21:03 (CST) on the night of February 25, 1967 I sighted from the window of room 355 of the East Chemistry Addition on the University of Illinois campus in Urbana, Illinois what I believed to be an unusual flying object. When this object was first observed it appeared in the eastern sky as a single ball of yellow light moving east at a low rate of speed. The object seemed to be approximately 45 degrees above the western horizon when initially sighted. No compass was on hand so that orientation street in Urbana, Illinois was used as a reference, assuming that this street is a true east-west line (said street is visible from the window mentioned above). No accurate measure of the object's altitude could be made. Qualitatively, it seemed that the object was approximately 1,000 feet above the ground if it were assumed to have the size of a very small single engine aircraft. After making written notes of these features I summoned another employee from my laboratory and together we observed the object until it had progressed so far toward us that it could no longer be viewed from the above mentioned window.

At this point I ran to the street below (Matthews street entrance to a parking lot behind the Chemistry Annex) and was accompanied by another employee. We sighted the object again and noted that no aircraft lights (i.e. no red, green, or white lights) were visible, that no sound was emitted by the object, and that there was no definite structure associated with the yellow ball of light. It appeared to me at that time that the object was slowly turning to a heading of northeast. No change in altitude was noticed and the object maintained its very smooth, slow movement across the sky. The yellow light clearly fluctuated in intensity.

Intensity, dimming sharply to small size and then returning to a ball of light of approximately the same size and intensity as originally observed. These fluctuations displayed no noticeable periodicity.

To get a clearer view of the object we then went to the roof of the East Chemistry Addition. From this vantage point the object floated above the ground. A commanding view of the surrounding area is available. Again we sighted the object and noted that it was moving slowly to the northeast. At this time it was noted that (1) the full moon was in the southwestern quadrant of the sky and that (2) the wind direction, as estimated by observing the smoke from the University power plant, was approximately southwest. The object was lost from view at 3:13 (CST) just before we left the roof. At that time the weather conditions in the area were noted. The sky was cloudless.

Shortly after returning from the roof I telephoned the University of Illinois Police Department and reported the sighting described above.

b. Champaign Urbana Firer Department: No sightings or anything unusual.
c. Chicago NICAP: No sightings reported.

h. State AN-UFO Investigator: No reported sightings. 
i. Champaign Willard Airport Tower: No unusual sightings.
j. WCIA Television: Enclosed is a copy of the news release given Saturday light to WCIA-TV, Champaign.
Weather conditions at time of sightings. See attachment 2.
Captain Edward Rourann, Staff Navigator furnished the following information:
Venus - 12 degree elevation at a 290° degree bearing.
Jupiter - 60 degree elevation, 90 degree bearing.
Saturn: 300 degree elevation, 100° bearing.
These planets are in a fairly bright magnitude.
Dr. Light-Patterson AFB on U.C.ta could not place bright satellites in the area.
At the present time, I have not been able to determine what the object was. It was observed by several individuals whose reports tend to agree on color, size, speed and maneuver. Since I have been unable to obtain more specific information.

A number of people in the Champaign-Urbana area reported sighting an unidentified flying object west of Champaign shortly after 5 o'clock, working at the University of Illinois. The object was described as coming out of the west at an estimated altitude of one-thousand feet. The object was yellow in color and had no markings, but it was pulsating and going very slowly at a level flight. It was observed for a total of 5 to 10 minutes before it disappeared.

The University of Illinois police and the FAA control tower at the U of I Willard Airport both reported that they had numerous calls about the sighted U-F-O. Several callers to Channel Three also reported the incident, and a few said they believed it to be a balloon with a flare attached.

Sir:

In accordance with your request I enclose one (1) copy of my description of a sighting of an unidentified flying object which I reported on February 25, 1967. I believe that you will find that this is essentially the same as that transmitted to you by telephone on February 27, 1967.

This information is submitted to the United States Air Force with the understanding that the information will remain confidential. I also need to point out that the opinion expressed is not in any way official; they are personal opinions of an individual. I believe that you will find that the conclusions drawn by the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of the University of Illinois are tentative and based upon limited data. We have voluntarily submitted this report to a government agency as a private citizen and not officially as representatives of the University of Illinois.

I hope that my observations will be of use to you. In the event that I may be of further service in this connection please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
