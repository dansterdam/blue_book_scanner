Dear [redacted]

Reference your letter regarding your observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

A detailed investigation revealed that you probably observed the planet Venus which, at the time of the sighting, was low in the western sky. Venus, with a stellar magnitude of -3.5 on April 3, 1967, would have been the brightest astronomical body in the western sky.

We had no additional reports from your area on the night of April 3, 1967; however, for the past month and a half, Venus has been responsible for numerous UFO observations.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.

Dear Sir:

Last night (April 13 1967) at about
9:30 p.m. est., I noticed a very
brilliant light which I estimate
to have been west-northwest of
Springfield, Ohio. Because of its
position in relation to the horizon
I thought that it might have
been an airplane. But landing
lights on. I watched for about
four minutes, and the light
were moved... then assumed

that it could be the planet Clems
zonal it is unusually bright
at times.

I went outside to look at it
to make sure that it was not a
reflection on the window and it
was still there. At about 9:55 P.M. I went
to the window to see if it had
moved as does regular most
but apparently at that moment
so far as to be completely gone
in relation to the rest of the
stars in the sky. I checked
periodically until about 12:30
A.M., but I never saw it again.
I am not saying that my
might have been as so called
U.F.O., but it did seem strange
to me and I would appreciate if
- it if you could possibly give

some sort of an explanation. I
would a lot. Wish to know if
anyone who in the area might
have seen it so that I would
know whether I saw something
real or not.
