During the night of Jan 5, 1968 while driving on state Rt. 340 toward Columbus, Ohio, my wife noticed two lights coming up in the darkness. At first she thought they were airplane lights, but as they approached they appeared to be too large and close to the ground. I watched them for approximately 2 to 3 minutes as they passed over our car from the rear and went on ahead. They were about the size of a 2 car garage but did not have any red or green running lights like an airplane. They seemed to be round in shape and not making any sound that we could hear while passing over us. After they passed on ahead of us they simply disappeared from view."

The letter describes an incident that occurred on the night of January 23, 1963 when the writer was dispatched to investigate an unidentified flying object near Columbus, Ohio. The letter states that the writer was not fully satisfied with the manner in which the incident was handled, and requests that any detailed graphs or drawings of the objects be forwarded to the writer. The letter also lists several organizations that may have conducted detailed and accurate observations of the incident.

Major Hector Quintanilla, Director
Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I wish to submit, officially, the following report which is a record of my observations the night of 23 Jan 63. My persons observed UFO activity in the Ohio & Indiana areas on 23 Jan 63 at approximately 2000 hours. I have been instructed to forward this report to you. 

The nature of my call was to investigate two bright lights seen by many persons, hovering approximately 2 miles south of the City of Hillsboro in Highland County. At this time I was dispatched our switchboard had already received five calls from public citizens making inquiries into the activity. I proceeded to the area as quickly as possible but these objects were standing quite still. After several minutes the objects made some very unusual maneuvers. They appeared to raise and lower, rotating and darting from side to side for extended periods of time and then, as if under intelligent control, they would remain motionless. The extreme brightness of the objects in question was very impressive to me.

I must say that I am not at all satisfied with the manner in which I was handied this case. I feel however, that it may have been handled this may for security or for some other reason that would not be readily apparent to me.

At this time I will not burden you with a detailed description of my observations, but I do wish to bring to your attention that I am sending eleven detailed graphs showing movements of these objects. One overlay map of the area involved and a copy of the report to Dr. J.J. Snyder of Northwestern University.

To qualify myself at least as a fairly intelligent and accurate observer, offer the following experience where accurate and detailed observations were of utmost importance:

1) Federal Bureau of Investigation, Identification Division 
2) (Top Secret Classification)
3) United States Army, Military Police
4) Recently with Franklin County Sheriff's Department, Columbus, Ohio (current position)

I await your reply and look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Sincerely,
(Signature)

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. It appears to be a scanned copy of a typed letter describing a UFO sighting.

Dear sirs:

It has come to my attention that although this sighting has been reported to NICAP, Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern University' Dept. of Astronomy and University of Colorado's UFO center, the case enclosed has not been 'officially reported' to Project Bluebook' at WPAFB, although it was reported to Lockbourne AFS. Please consider this 'official', because you'll undoubtedly be hearing more about it if you haven't already.

On the night of Jan. 23rd, 1968, I witnessed the story I wrote and enclose with this letter; 43 others in my area have been interviewed or contacted who saw essentially the same phenomena I did. I followed objects which were not jet-or any type of traditionally propelled vehicles, hovering above 40 minutes after 11 o'clock; deputies were watching 2 circular glowing objects hover over a landing light tower in southern Franklin County.

Two objects hovered one above another, one o'clock position, and switched places as I watched. At closest point of sighting, a " grid" of some sort was visible on nearest object. Object appeared approximately the size of a DC-3 only circular, glowing, and silent. 

Objects' borders (edges) were defined, and seemed to 'contain or hold' the glowing themselves, I'm not sure what the glowing fields designated when objects moved or not, but nearest I can explain is that when objects moved they seemed to 'gather themselves up' with light, in sort of a preparation against inertia, before moving.

Objects disappeared to the east, straight out into the sky, approx 15 degree angle, so fast it seemed to pull and hurt one's eyes, when they finally disappeared.

For credentials, if they're necessary, I'm a senior at Ohio State University.

The document discusses a UFO sighting on January 23, 1968 near Columbus, Ohio. It mentions that the sighting was reported to the Base UFO Officer (Col. Hinkle), who had received two reports of UFOs on that date. However, the sighting was not investigated further because it did not fall under the category of valid UFO reports according to regulations. The document states that Col. Hinkle indicated he would probably receive a Congressional inquiry about the report and that it would have to be investigated. He replied that he would do what he could regarding the investigation.

JAN. 24,1968 COLUMBUS DISPATCH

Glowing Objects Hover Over City in
Amazing UFO Display

By E. E. ELLIOTT
Of The Dispatch Staff

Franklin County sheriff's deputies, newsmen, and residents "viewed an amazing UFO demonstration over Columbus shortly after midnight Tuesday.

Astonishingly, Lockbourne AFB reportedly said they saw nothing on their radarscopes of the "flying objects - sighted.

SHERIFF'S deputy Thomas Parker and Deputy Edward Barber of the Prairie Township police department gave this account:

About 9 p.m. the two were dispatched to the vicinity of Big Run and Giants Res. to investigate reports of flashing lights in the sky.

"They appeared to hover about as high as most commercial airplanes - around 1500 to 2000 feet. One hovered a little higher than the others, and they stayed in that position for about 20 seconds," Parker told them.

"Then, as we watched, they [the objects] changed position slightly and disappeared in a blinding flash," the deputy said. "It was like looking into a spotlight."

"THEY APPEARED to be round - like looking into a spotlight - that's the one thing I ever saw in the sky."

They appeared to hover about as high as most commercial airplanes - around 1500 to 2000 feet. One hovered a little higher than the others, and they stayed in that position for about 20 seconds. Then, as we watched, they [the objects] changed position slightly and disappeared in a blinding flash. It was like looking into a spotlight.

On arriving, the deputies immediately saw two such lights.

"THEN, as we watched, they [the objects] changed position slightly and then disappeared in a blinding flash," the deputies reported. "It was like looking into a spotlight."

WITHIN another minute or so, the deputies reported, the upper of the two glowing, yellowish-white vehicles "zipped" higher to meet the lower of the two, and the four remaining objects then moved in a parallel formation.

The deputies remained in contact with the sheriff's office by radio, and by this method Lockbourne AFB was telephoned. But Lockbourne apparently said they had seen nothing on their radarscopes.

As the deputies continued to watch, one of the vehicles "quickly said, "and one of them began to pulsate," began to move away. "Then they all moved away from the area," Barker said.

SEVERAL area residents, including the Franklin Township and Grove City police departments, reported seeing the objects. The sheriff's office said Wednesday one of the residents said the objects descended to a point above the treetops of Lockbourne minutes, west of Interstate 71 and slightly south of Rt. 665.

This reporter and Dispatch photographer - Time Barnes arrived in the area about 15 minutes after initial reports and soon sighted one of the objects hovering about three miles east of Grove City. 

It appeared to descend vaguely circular in shape and some all over with a pulsing, yellowish-white light. Two observers reported that the object then shot upward and rapidly disappeared.

UFOs
Continued from Page 1
The object would never last for as much as a minute at a time, then would move several miles away as fast as the eye could follow, and hover motionless again.
The observers said they appeared to be about the size of an airplane, except for a flashing tail. There was no noise.
Shortly before 9 p.m. all objects disappeared, the hovering pair near northern Columbus appeared to simply extinguish themselves like candle flames.
The pair of objects south of Columbus disappeared to the east, slowly at first, then vanished almost instantaneously in a burst of speed.
Both Lockbourne officials and Port Columbus tower spokesmen denied reports of UFO sightings or radar identification of any such vehicles.
The Lockbourne base officials Wednesday said the call from the sheriff's office was the only report they had of the incident. They said officials of Project Blue Book (which checks UFO reports) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, were notified immediately and a formal report was sent to them Wednesday.
The Lockbourne spokesman said if aircraft were observed to investigate the sight, they would have been sent from Dayton on Wright-Patterson orders.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X AT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE BEGINNING WHERE FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "T" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE DISAPPEARANCE POINT.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "T" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE X AND T WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATELY SHOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "T", THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS ITEM.
