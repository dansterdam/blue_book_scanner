Observers watched 2 bright bluish white lights that had the ability to hover and move at extreme speeds. After 20 to 30 minutes the lights disappeared to the SE.

COMMENTS: A deep temperature inversion existed during sighting and two KC-135 aircraft were shooting instrument approaches to runway 05R at Lockbourne AFB during this time. Report indicated that the lights were seen in the general vicinity of Lockbourne. Tower and GCA were queried at the time of sighting with negative results. Crews of the KC-135's did not see anything unusual.

Major Hector Quintanilla, Director
Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I wish to submit, officially, the following report which is a record of my observations the night of 23 Jan 68. Many persons observed UFO activity in this Central Ohio area on 23 Jan 68 and 24 Jan 68. Some of these observations were reported to Lockbourne Air Force Base, but I understand from the Public Information Office at Lockbourne Air Force Base that the information was not reported to Project Blue Book. I feel that my observations may be of sufficient interest that they should be brought to your attention.

On the night of 23 Jan 68 at approximately 2000 hours, I was dispatched to the general vicinity of Big Run Road and Gentz Road in Franklin County. The nature of my call was to investigate two bright lights seen by many persons, moving in the southeastern section of the sky. At the time I was dispatched our switchboard had already received five calls from public citizens living on Big Run Road. Upon arriving at the Big Run Road area I could readily see the lights in question. At first these objects appeared to be standing quite still. After several minutes the objects made some very amazing movements or maneuvers. They had the ability to remain motionless for extended periods of time and then, as if under intelligent control, they could move any direction with an instant burst of speed. This amazing speed and the extreme brightness of the objects in question was very impressive to say the least.

I must say that I am not at all satisfied with the manner in which Lockbourne Air Force Base has handled this particular sighting. I can, however, assure that it may have been handled this way for security or for some other reason that should not be known to the public and myself.

At this time I will not burden you with a detailed description of my observations, but I do wish to bring to your attention that I am sending eleven detailed graphs showing movements of these objects, one overlay map of the area involved and a copy of this letter to Dr. J. A. Hynek of Northwestern University.

To qualify myself, at least as an intelligent and accurate observer, I offer the following experience where accurate and detailed observations were of utmost importance in carrying out the objectives:

1) Federal Bureau of Investigation, Identification Division
   (Fingerprint Classification)
2) United States Army, Military Police
   (Patrol Division)
3) Presently with Franklin County Sheriff's Department, Columbus, Ohio
   (Patrol Division)

Dear sirs:

It has come to my attention that although this sighting has been reported to NICAP, Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern University Dept. of Astronomy and University of Colorado's UFO center, the case enclosed has not been 'officially reported' to Project Bluebook' at WPAFB, although it was reported to Lockbourne AFB. Please consider this "official", because you'll undoubtedly be hearing more about it if you haven't already.

On the night of Jan. 23rd, 1968, I witnessed the story I wrote and enclose with this letter; 43 others in my area have been interviewed or contacted who saw essentially the same phenomena I did. I followed objects which were not jets-or any type of traditionally propelled vehicles- for about 40 minutes after I was notified by radio that sheriff deputies, were watching 2 circular glowing objects hover over a landing light tower in southern Franklin County.

Two objects hovered one above another, one o'clock position, and switched places as I watched. At closest point of sighting, a "grid" of some sort was visible on nearest object. Object appeared approximately the size of a DC-3 only circular, glowing, and silent.

Objects' borders (edges) were defined by light. I'm not sure whether the glowing intensified when objects moved or not, but nearest I can explain is that when objects moved they seemed to 'gather themselves up' with light, in sort of a preparation against inertia, before moving.

Objects disappeared to the east, straight out into the sky, approx 15 degree angle, so fast it seemed to pull and hurt one's eyes, when they finally disappeared.

For credentials, if they're necessary, I'm a senior at Ohio State

MEMO FOR THE RECORD (1500)                                                   25 March 1968

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting of 23 January 1968

Called Lockborne AFB, regarding 23 Jan 68 sighting. Talked to the Base UFO Officer (Col Hinkle), phone 987-4884. He had two reports of UFO's on the 23d. They were not investigated because they did not fall under the category of UFO's since the regulation state that just lights in the sky do not constitute valid UFO reports. Lt Marano told XXXXX Col Hinkle that we would probable receive a Congressional on the report and that it would have to be investigated. Lt Marano stated he would send him a copy of the letters we had received and asked him to investigate it since it was reported to them first. He replied that he would do what he could.

JAN 24th 1968 Columbus Dispatch

Glowing Objects Hover Over City in
Amazing UFO Display

By G. E. ELLIOTT
Of The Dispatch Staff

Franklin County sheriff's deputies, newsmen, and residents viewed an amazing UFO demonstration over Columbus about 8 p.m. Tuesday. Lockbourne AFB authorities concerned with UFO's reported they saw nothing on radar and received no telephone calls about so-called "flying saucers."

SHERIFF'S deputy Thomas Barker and Deputy Edward Purkhiser of the Prairie Township police department gave this account:

About 8 p.m. the two were dispatched to the vicinity of Big Run and Gantz Rds. to check for "lights hovering in the sky" after the sheriff's office received five telephone calls from southeast area families.

On arriving, the deputies immediately saw two such lights.

"THEY APPEARED round," Barker said. "We watched them looking into a spotlight up close ... about the brightest thing I ever saw in the sky.

"They appeared to hover about as high as most commercial airplanes fly around here — about 1500 to 3000 feet. One hovered a little higher than the other, and they stayed in that position for about 20 seconds," Barker said.

"Then, as we watched, they changed positions with each other, and hovered that way for two to three minutes."

WITHIN another minute or so, the deputies reported, the upper of the two glowing, yellowish vehicles "zipped down" to meet the other, and the two remained parallel and motionless.

The deputies remained in contact with the sheriff's office by radio, and by this time the sheriff's radio dispatcher had telephoned the Lockbourne AFB UFO office to inform military specialists.

As the deputies continued to watch, one of the vehicles left the other "so quickly," said, "and one of them began to move away in a southeasterly horizon."

It looked like a bullet in flight, and at a slight upward incline. It was completely out of sight in less than five seconds.

AFTER several minutes the object which had left returned, and the two moved in formation to a point above the four antennas of the old light towers for the Lockbourne and slightly west of I-71 runway. Three both objects descended, until "they appeared to hover almost on top of the antennas," and remained there for several minutes.

"Then they moved away from the towers," Barker said. It appeared flattened, vaguely circular in shape and yellowish-white light. The objects were hovering about three miles east of Grove City.

It arrived in the area about 15 minutes after initial reports and soon sighted one of the objects hovering about three miles east of Grove City.

jet, seemed to be about the size of an airliner, except for its shape. It made no noise.

THE OBJECT would hover for as much as a minute at a time, then would move several miles away as fast as the eye could follow, and hover motionless again.

The reporter and photographer tried to follow the object in its erratic path to get close enough to photograph, but were hampered by its ability to move "as the crow flies".

After The Dispatch team had followed the object around southern Franklin County for nearly half an hour, a second appeared and hovered near the first in a one o'clock position.

ABOUT 8:45 p.m. two identical vehicles appeared over the North Side of Columbus glowing brightly and hovering in close formation for several minutes. By this time a number of airplanes appeared, presumably in search of the objects, but apparently did not succeed in approaching the disc-like objects.

Shortly before 9 p.m. all objects disappeared; the hovering pair near northgern Columbus appeared to simply extinguish themselves like candle flames.

The pair of objects south of Columbus disappeared to the east slowly at first, then vanished almost instantaneously in a burst of speed.

Both Lockbourne officials and Port Columbus tower spokemen denied reports of UFO sightings or radar identifications of any such vehicles.

Lockbourne base officials Wednesday said the call from the sheriff's office was the only report they had of the incident. They said officials of Project Blue Book which checks UFO reports at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, were notified immediately and a form report was sent to them Wednesday.

The Lockbourne spokesman said if aircraft were ordered to investigate the sighting, they would have been sent from Dayton on Wright-Patterson orders.

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
