Gentlemen:

Hiking back from Cooperstown, this morning, we sighted a moving object high in the sky at approximately 2:15 A.M. This object appeared to have an obceles triangular shape. It glowed an orange-yellow and appeared to have no other lights. Upon its appearance, a motor-like sound was heard which was similar to that of an airliner.

Traveling from East to West on a straight course, it made an apparent turn to the left. After it disappeared over the treetops, we sighted it again in another clearing, hoovering in the distance, to our amazement, the object made an acute circular loop. A white hazy light then enveloped the object, and it slowly disappeared from our sight.

Then at approximately 2:45 A.M., we sighted another strange object. Since our view was obstructed by the trees, our sighting of this object was limited to a few seconds. A very brilliant white light shot across the treetops leaving two wakes behind it. Its course was parallel to the ground, rather than falling, and it was traveling from East to West. One of the three of us thought it had a saucer-like shape. It appeared to be reasonably close, and had no sail and whatever.

If this latter will help you in any way, our purpose of writing it will have been accomplished.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature lines are blacked out]
