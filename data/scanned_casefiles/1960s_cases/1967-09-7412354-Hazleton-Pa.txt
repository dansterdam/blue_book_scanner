CONFLICTING DATA

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer indicated that the object went east to west but the witness indicated that it went to east. The observer lives near an airfield and other observers on the block said it was an airplane. Although it is felt that the object may have been an airplane because of the discrepancy on the direction and 12 minutes being a little long for aircraft it is being evaluated as conflicting data.

Information:

The object was viewed by the naked eye and the aid of a pair of binoculars. Moving in east to west pattern, it traveled at a great rate of speed. Blinked lights off and on, alternating from light to bright. Sometimes the object would seem to disappear that it was a little bit after it was moving. It was slowing over large water tower, other it would get from vision to Jodger up a light second. It would always stop then take off again a bit, of maybe even faster. With some static on the object while it was an object light at times to present it out of me and it turned out to be a complete different object in a different part of the sky. If there was seen other things in the sky, with it...
