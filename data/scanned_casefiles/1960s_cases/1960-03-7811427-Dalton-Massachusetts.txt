10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A 30 lb. chunk of ice fell in Dalton, Mass. The area was surveyed by an ATIC investigator and there was no overhead object from which the ice could have fallen. The scatter pattern was a fairly even distribution over an area 25' x 20'. The ice was analyzed and described as porus, or like rime ice.

11. COMMENTS
ATIC has arrived at no conclusion as to the origin of the ice. Future cases may indicate a pattern which will lead to a conclusion.

Ice Fall - Dalton, Massachusetts

On 25 March 1960, a 30 pound chunk of ice fall in Dalton, Massachusetts. The area was surveyed by an ATIC investigator, and there were no overhead objects from which the ice could have fallen. The splatter pattern was a fairly even distribution over an area 23' by 23'. The ice was described as rather porous, or like rive ice. A sample was taken from the center of one of the larger pieces in an attempt to preclude contamination from the local area. The sample was transported to ATIC in an air tight container. An analysis of the sample was accomplished by the physics laboratory of the Wright Air Development Division, and a copy of the report is attachment #1 to this document.

OUT OF THE SKY Friday night came a 30-pound chunk of ice which dug a deep hole in the yard of Mr. and Mrs. Larry Roche of Dalton, Mr. Roche points to some of the shattered pieces he thinks fell from an airplane. Particles of sand were found in the broken pieces. A Cambridge scientist has asked Roche to save melted residue so he can analyze it.

The image shows a snowy outdoor scene with a building, trees, and a figure standing in the foreground, pointing to something on the ground.

MEMO TO: Major Friend

SUBJECT: Report of Dalton, Mass. Ice Fall, 25 March 1960

1. At 10:30 P.M., EST, Friday, 25 March 1960, Mr and Mrs [redacted], Dalton, Mass. reported the fall of many pounds of ice from the sky. This was reported on the radio, and I called [redacted] and asked him to put a sample of the ice in the freezer. Later in the week a friend in Boston volunteered to make the trip from Boston to Dalton, Mass. (300 miles) round trip, to pick up the ice. He cut a chunk out of the center of the ice sample and the melted sample is herewith submitted.

2. The circumstances of the fall were these: Shortly before 10:30 the Roches' 15 year old son returned from an errand making copious tracks in the snow within a few minutes there was a very loud noise outside that "shook the house". Everyone dashed outside thinking that there had been an accident. The tracks were completely gone. All that was found was the fallen ice which landed very close to the tracks. In the snow made by the [redacted] boy just a few minutes earlier. This made a hole in the ground about one inch deep. The landing spot of the ice is pictured in inclosure, and also close-ups of the ice. It was determined that the ice could not have fallen from the roof or the trees. The landing pattern of the ice is shown in inclosed diagram.

3. The ice itself resembled tapioca snow and was considerably less dense than ordinary ice for it was quite coarse and a chunk the size of a man's head probably weighed not more than a pound. By no consideration could the frozen snow-ice be thought the same as the surrounding snow and ice.

4. Exact weather conditions have not yet been determined, but witnesses stated that they could see stars. They also stated that their house does not lie under any scheduled airlines.

5. A sample of the water has been given to [redacted] at Smithsonian for further analysis. If he is suggested the present sample be subjected to analysis at Wright Field.

Dr J. Allen Hynek

NOTE: Water sample should be analyzed for type of water (coastal, rain, etc.), mineral content, and organic content, and such other analysis as is deemed appropriate - also spectrographic analysis of residue in water.

             James O. Collier

I.   PURPOSE
     To analyse a sample of thawed ice water and determine its composition.

II.  FACTUAL DATA
     1. The sample was received and assigned Physics Laboratory Suborder No.
        P-6.

     2. The sample was analyzed by emission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction
        analysis.

     3. Emission spectrographic analysis indicated the water to have the
        following composition:

        Filtered thawed ice water -
        Minor   - Magnesium

        Traces  - Silicon, manganese, aluminum, iron, nickel,
                  copper, sodium, zinc, chromium and calcium

        Large and small particles (residues) -
        Principal - Calcium

        Majors   - Silicon, magnesium, aluminum and iron

        Minors   - Manganese, copper, sodium, zinc, titanium and
                   chromium

        Traces   - Tin, lead and nickel

Here is the text from the document:

4.   X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the large and small particles
     are the same compound. The compound was identified as silicon dioxide
     (SiO2), a natural mineral.

III. CONCLUSIONS

     There was not enough of the thawed ice water to conduct any other
     analysis.

IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS

     None, data merely submitted.
