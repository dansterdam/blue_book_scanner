The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an incident that occurred on March 22, 1960 in Dalton, Massachusetts. The text discusses a sighting of an unidentified object that was observed over an area measuring 23" by 23". The object was described as resembling one of the larger pieces in an attempt to provide examples of its appearance. The document mentions that the object was investigated by the physics laboratory of the Wright Air Development Division.

Text found in the document:

Ice Ball - Dalton, Massachusetts

On 22 March 1960, a 10 pound chunk of ice fell in Dalton, Massachusetts. This was found with an AFIC Operations Notice which had been dispatched in Advance to Air Force bases and other interested agencies. The sighting was a fairly even distribution over an area 23" by 23". The ice was described as resembling one of the larger pieces in an attempt to provide examples of its appearance. It was submitted to the physics laboratory of the Wright Air Development Division, and a copy of the report is attached to this document.

The image appears to be a photograph of a person standing in a snowy outdoor scene. The caption below the image provides additional context, describing an object that fell from the sky on a Friday night and was recovered by Mr. Berry.

OUT OF THE SKY Friday night came a 30-pound chunk of what. lux a deep hole in the snow and Mr. Berry, who lives in some of the business places he thinks fell from an airliner. Careful examination did not reveal the exact material as to whether it was a meteorite or something else. Authorities examined it and were unable to analyze as to its nature.

The image shows a black and white photograph of a snowy outdoor scene. There is a person standing in the foreground, facing away from the camera, with buildings and trees visible in the background. The text below the image describes an object that fell from the sky on a Friday night, which was a 33-pound chunk that dug a deep hole in the ground. The text mentions that pieces from this object were found and analyzed.

OUT OF THE SKY Friday night came a 33-pound chunk which dug a deep hole in the yard of Mr. and Mrs. Larry Eicher of Dalton. Mr. Eicher found pieces of the object, and the Air Force which investigated this incident said the pieces melted residue as he can analyze it.

7 April 1960
MEMO FOR: Major Friend
SUBJECT: Report of Dalton, Mass. Ice Fall, 25 March 1960

1. A. R. ACUFF, Jr. of Dalton, Mass. reported the fall of many pounds of ice from the sky. Dalton, Mass. reported the fall of many pounds of ice and asked him to get a sample of the ice in the freezer. Later in the week, he was instructed to forward the sample to Dalton, Mass. (CG 0 miles) found this ice to be from the sample that he took and the rainfall sample.

2. The circumstances of the fall were these: Shortly before 10:30, the teacher's 15 year old son returned from an errand, making cautious tracks in the snow. Shortly after, a loud noise was heard and pieces of ice were dashed outside thinking that there had been a baseball thrown through the house. Examination disclosed that there were a number of pieces of ice, some the size of a softball, scattered about the yard. The landing of the ice is pictured in the enclosure and also close-ups of the ice. It was determined that the pattern of the ice is shown in the included diagram.

3. The ice itself was considerably less dense than ordinary ice for it was quite coarse and a chunk the size of a baseball weighed only about one pound. By no consideration could the frozen snow-ice be thought the same as the surrounding snow, and it did not lie under any scheduled airline.

4. A sample of the water has been given to be analyzed at Smithsonian for analysis at Wright Field.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek

NOTE: Water sample should be analyzed for types of water (coastal, rain, distilled, etc.), mineral content, and organic content; and such other analyses as is necessary to determine the composition of the frozen water.

EVALUATION REPORT
ANALYSIS OF ICE WATER

REPORT NO: 4708 P50-7
PROJECT NO: 577101
MANUFACTURER: ATON-4322
SUBMITTED BY: James G. Colton

I. PURPOSE
To analyze a sample of thawed ice water and determine its composition.

II. ACTUAL DATA
1. The sample was received and assigned Physics Laboratory Suborder No. 
2. The sample was analyzed by emission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis.
3. Emission spectroscopic analysis indicated the water to have the following composition:

Filtered thawed ice water -
Major - Magnesium
Traces - Silicates, aluminum, iron, nickel, copper, sodium, zinc, chromium and calcium
Large and small particles (residue) -
Principal - Calcium
Major - Silicates, magnesium, aluminum and iron
Minors - Manganese, copper, sodium, zinc, titanium and chromium
Traces - Tin, lead and nickel

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a technical report or document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

30-RAY DIFFRACTION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE LARGE AND SMALL PARTICLES ARE THE SAME COMPOUND. THE COMPOUND IS IDENTIFIED AS SILICA DIOXIDE (QUARTZ), A NATURAL MINERAL.

III. CONCLUSIONS
There was not enough of the shaved ice sample to conduct any other analysis.

IV. RECOMMENDATIONS
None, data nearly submitted.
