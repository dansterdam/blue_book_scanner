11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer was awakened by a sound similar to the hum of an electric motor or a transformer that was in the process of going bad. Upon looking out the bedroom window the observer sighted several amber lights that were arranged in an elliptical fashion. (One was blinking). It appeared to have a slow forward up and down motion except when it made a left banking turn.

COMMENTS: The most likely stimulus was a helicopter with an unusual lighting system. However a check of the airports in the area revealed that 3 definitely did not have any helicopter activity in the area and the other hand destroyed flight records. For that date and was therefore unable to say if any helicopters originated from their airfield that night. It is also possible that a light aircraft such as an aerial advertiser, the googiest blimp, or an aircraft doing infra-red photography may not been definitely established.

SIGHTING OF UFO AND IT'S SOUND by Roman K. Lupton 1-17-69

I was asleep from approximately 10:30 PM of January 16, 1969 until 3:24AM January 17, 1969. At that time I was awakened by an unusual sound. This sound was similar to the hum of an electric motor or a transformer that was in the process of going bad. This sound was changing at an even rate very loud to normal or a little lower then back to loud. This noise was changing at a constant rate as far as my ears could tell. I said, "What in the world is that noise?" I asked my wife can you hear that noise? she replied "yes".

I went to the bedroom window, lifted a venetian blind slat and looked in the direction of the sound for a few seconds before it came into sight (at 75° angles). As it was in view directly in front of the window and at a fairly high angle 45°. I asked my wife to come and look but the noise outside and my back being toward her must have kept her from hearing me since she did not get up to look out of the window.

I watched this object with lights all around the bottom move slowly forward with an up and down motion which was also slow, 30 mph varying not more than 25 feet up and down. It went forward over a yard light in my neighbors yard next door, a little further forward and started in a banking left turn with the same speed and motion as before. At this point the object seemed to tilt and turn instead of changing elevation except for this banking motion it was the same as it had been previously appearing to remain in the same rhythm. At this time as it was turning, the blinking light was the clearest and possibly could have been the first time I saw it. I'm not sure but it remained in a blinking state until the object was out of sight.

AIRCRAFT OF THIS TYPE WAS IN THE AREA, the sighting is being carried as "UNIDENTIFIED".

SIGHTING OF UFO AND IT'S SOUND by Roman K. Lupton 1-17-69

I was asleep from approximately 10:30 PM of January 16, 1969 until 3:24AM January 17, 1969. At that time I was awakened by an unusual sound. This sound was similar to the hum of an electric motor or a transformer that was in the process of going bad. This sound was changing at an even rate very loud to normal or a little lower then back to loud. This noise was changing at a constant rate as far as my ears could tell. I said, "What in the world is that noise?" I asked my wife can you hear that noise? she replied "yes".

I went to the bedroom window, lifted a venetian blind slat and looked in the direction of the sound for a few seconds before it came into sight (at 75° angles). As it was in view directly in front of the window and at a fairly high angle 45°. I asked my wife to come and look but the noise outside and my back being toward her must have kept her from hearing me since she did not get up to look out of the window.

I watched this object with lights all around the bottom move slowly forward with an up and down motion which was also slow, 30 mph varying not more than 25 feet up and down.

At this time as it was turning, the blinking light was the clearest and possibly could have been the first time I saw it. I'm not sure but it remained in a blinking state until the object was out of sight.


- page 13 -

At this point it went out of sight. I said to my wife as I turned away from the window towards her "Did you hear that?" again louder and she replied "yes". She wanted to know what it was and I stated "It was a UFO". With the noise still in the background but getting fainter, I contacted the telephone operator in Smithfield, as I was telling her what I had heard and seen she stated "I think I can hear it" or "I can hear it" ...just to be sure...because I was wondering if this whole situation was a dream or nightmare ...I asked her "You can: are you sure?" she replied "Yes, I can hear it". During the time that I was speaking with the telephone operator the noise was deep in the background ... the noise ceased for perhaps 5 seconds or so and then recurred for a short time before going out of hearing distance. At this point I told the telephone operator that I should contact someone and notify them of this situation. I was trying to decide whether to notify law enforcement or the Air Force.

I decided on the Air Force. I got her to get Air Force Langley Field, Hampton, Virginia. The operator answered for Langley and stated what needed to be done and he connected me to the airman who records UFO's and I again told him what I had seen and he wanted a description and I gave it to him.

When I returned to bed it was 3:30AM January 17, 1969. I had not noticed any weather conditions or if the moon or any starts were shinning even though it had been plenty clear enough for me to see the unidentified object out of my window.


- page 14 -

I had been unable to go back to sleep and just a little before 6:00AM the alarm clock went off and I got out of bed and made preparations for going to work. I related my experience of the night to the two members of my driving combinations - one from Portsmouth and one from Churchland - as we were driving to NASA on the morning of January 17, 1969 and they gave no reply. After I arrived at work I told my fellow workers - they seemed concerned and a good deal of discussion followed. I related my experience to the local newspaper. A reporter from the newspaper called me and I told him what I had seen and heard during the night. I also told him about my discussion with the telephone operator and what she had said to me during our telephone conversation. I was unable to get the name of the telephone operator I had talked to on January 17, 1969 however; after trying every day since January 19, 1969 I finally got an answer from the Chief operator on Wednesday evening January 22, 1969 - she said "I have had a talk at length with her and the only thing she could have possibly heard during the course of the night was the normal sound of an aircraft going over". I tried to tell her that the girl had stated different to me and that I would like to talk to her under any circumstances with any one present and get her name but she said "it would do no good" because she repeated the same thing over again just as if nothing had gone on and that she had rehearsed her statement over and over.


- page 15 -

On January 17, 1969 I wondered all day who else might have seen or heard what I had. When I got home I started looking for someone and was real discouraged in a way when I asked my neighbors next door. The wife stated "No" but she remembered her mother saying she had heard something.

Sure enough the lady and her 3 year old granddaughter both had heard it.

The lady stated "it had awakened the girl and both were frightened", but the lady did not look out of her window to see what was making the sound.

She said that she wished she had. She said she would have had plenty of time to look. She wished she had since I saw what I did. She also stated that "it sounded as if it were coming through the roof". It sounded as if it was that low. I asked her what it sounded like and she explained to me fully that it had a varying sound and when it got to a point that she thought was directly over the roof it made a loud explosion and she didn't hear any more. This is something I did not hear (explosion).

Well, I still couldn't sleep that night either very well. I was up early and out - I asked directly and called on the phone a few neighbors to ask if they had heard or seen anything. Finally during the evening, January 18, 1969, I found another neighbor and she stated "yes" and that "the sound was loud and varying and it was coming from almost right on the roof top and it also frightened her four year old daughter, and she also was scared but now witness she had looked.

Well, I discussed my problem with a couple of aeronautical engineers in the building in which I work and they were very interested and wanted me to explain everything to them. I did, I drew a picture on the blackboard and described its motion. I had thought quite a bit about the sound and knew


- page 16 -

in my mind what it was like but had not tried to make it. Well, they questioned me about that so, I described it to them but would not try to make it at that time. Well, I went home and on the way home I practiced this noise. (January 20, 1969) I practiced until I thought I could make this noise well enough to imitate what I had heard. On January 21, 1969 I went to them and endeavored to imitate the sound of the flying object as I had heard it. I also learned on January 21, 1969 that an older couple in Carrolton had heard this unusual noise and I went to talk with them. They were convinced as I was that we had heard the same noise. Taking a road map and drawing a direct line between Smithfield and Eclipse, Carrolton falls right on this straight line.

Well my story goes on... I came to the conclusion that I was not going to find anyone else that had heard this noise when my neighbor asked me if I had asked someone who I had completely forgotten. I went and asked a lady and her son and the son stated he also had heard this noise. Today (1-21-69) my Sunday school teacher told me not to worry that I was not the only one who called Langley - that someone else heard the noise and called Langley and that they had given this person a rough time. I had told her previously (1-19-69) of my story and she evidently found this out during the week.

My conclusion to this story is that I saw and heard an unidentified flying object and I have reported it to the proper authorities. I hope my government will do research to discover satisfactorily an answer to this puzzle.

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

In response to your letter of 7 April 1969, I have contacted the flight scheduling clerk, Mrs. Marlene Martin, at Fort Eustis Airfield here concerning flight activities near Crittenden, Virginia on the night of 16-17 January 1969.

Mrs. Martin said that there were no Fort Eustis aircraft flying after 2130 hours, 16 January 1969, and flights did not resume until 0830 hours on 17 January 1969. She said that because of poor weather conditions, all helicopter flights were cancelled even earlier in the evening of 16 January 1969.

Thank you for your inquiry, but I am sorry that we can provide so little information concerning a possible UFO sighting. If we can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.

ATTN OF: DOO-L (Lt Col Swansiger)

SUBJECT: UFO'S

TO: FTD (TDETA)

Enclosed AF Form 117, UFO Sighting, is being forwarded to you for further study. Due to the proximity of Norfolk Navy Air Station and Langley AFB, and after discussing this sighting with [redacted], I attempted to bring into focus the sinilatry between his UFO sighting and a jet powered helicopter. He was not receptive to this line of reasoning. In response to a card received the 19th of March 1969 from a [redacted], a civilian employee at Fort Eustis, VA, I phoned to discuss this sighting with him. He wanted an immediate statement as to any or all findings on this sighting. I informed him that I had no information to disclose and I infer that he would remain in file to assist in evaluating other reports. [redacted] a firm believer in UFO's stated he would contact your office for a final answer on this sighting. Enclosed road map identifies observer's position and surrounding airfields/airports servicing the local area.
