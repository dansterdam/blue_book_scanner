The image appears to be a handwritten document with dense cursive script. While I can see the writing clearly, the text is written in a style that makes complete OCR challenging. At the bottom of the page, I can partially make out:

"19-62 January"
"Mellette, S.D."

The majority of the text is in cursive handwriting that is difficult to transcribe with full accuracy. Some words and phrases are legible, but a complete verbatim transcription would require careful manual review.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Letter to Secy of Defense asking for action against the flying saucers that are shooting down our planes and killing our "sons". Described incident where two jets were attacked by these saucers south of her farm. She sees them all the time, usually from 7:45 PM until 8:50PM, however tonight they were early so the encounter with the jets. After SE supposed attack on the jets by "the saucer", they threw in interburner and escaped. Observation on preceding evening was with surveyors transit. Occasionally they have lights that go on and off. She also reports what appeared to her to be an atomic blast in early march to the North of her location. (mushroom cloud).

EVALUATION: CASE CATEGORY ____________
CONCLUSION:
Witness probably saw something and distorted her impressions into the above tale. The duration of over one hour for the sightings earlier in the month are probably reflection of astronomical bodies, Anything that this lady sees in the air which she cannot readily identify is a saucer. March sightings from the Dakota's include one on March 1st of Venus, one on March 2nd of unidentified data, addition on March 10 of Venus again. No reports of mushroom clouds and no reports from A/C were received. Assuming that any A/C would report action such as the lady described) this case is classed as an unreliable report.

which looked exactly as the picture
of the bomb.

Sincerely,
Mrs [redacted]
Mellette, S.Dck.

P.S. I'm not into - My husband
and son both happened to be
in the yard & all saw the same
thing. I just feel sorry for the
families who lose some as we
also have a son and will judge what
it means and also realize that
just by husking things up you
will avoid accidents.
