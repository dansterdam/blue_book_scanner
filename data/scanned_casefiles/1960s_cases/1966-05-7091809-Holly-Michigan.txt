Gentlemen:

On May 1, 1966, at approximately 10 P.M. I observed an object. This object appeared to have 4 lights on it. These lights went out and went on again a couple of times. A light seemed to come from inside as seen through a porthole. Around this light was a bluish-green halo. This light stayed on around 2 minutes or two. Then this light seemed fading. The object seemed to be 60-70 feet in front of me and about 50 feet up. I snapped a picture of this and if you are interested in the picture and more details have someone contact me. I will be willing to give any information I have.

Sincerely,

FROM: Holly, Michigan 48442

On May 19, 1966 at 9:30 PM an object high in the sky. At first it looked like a falling star. I was looking through a telescope and the object was moving so fast I couldn't keep it in view.
It was coming down at an angle and then it had come quite a distance. It slowed down considerably. The way the lights of the object seemed to be pulsating, it seemed to me that it was some kind of a machine rather than just a light because of the pulsation and the way the light kept changing colors.
I got my binoculars and I could see the object quite distinctly. In my car I've got a 12 inch telescope and a pair of 7x50 binoculars. As I watched the object through the binoculars I could see that there was some kind of a dark shape around the lights. The object was down to the treetops and then it started rising again. And behind the object I could see several blue-green lights, as though they were antennas or something extending from the rear of the object.
At this time I turned on my camera and stepped the object moved upward. That could account for the fact that the pictures are a little blurry. When the object had reached about the same height that it started from it stopped the camera and the object moved upward.
When the picture was pulled from the camera there should be an abrupt end to the lights, but the lights seemed to be continuing. This line which was made when the picture was pulled from the camera could not account for the blurring of the image itself.
I estimated the object to be about 40 ft. wide, 20 ft. tall and from 75 to 100 yards from me. It was about 30 minutes from the time I first saw the object until it disappeared from sight. The only thing I can think of to compare the size of the object is that it looked as large as one of our 2 engine fighter planes when viewed from a distance.
As soon as I am finished with the picture I would like it returned to me since any publicity on this matter would hurt me for my job. I am a job setter for the Gary Civil Air Patrol. My duties are Planner/Observer for this group.

May 7, 1966 at 9:40 p.m. I spotted an object high in the sky. It appeared to be a falling star. Not just a point of light, but rather it had substance to it. As I watched, the object began descending at the same angle and speed of a falling star. The object was moving so fast that it took about 3 or 4 seconds to disappear from view. It caused no noise or sound. The entire sighting lasted about 3 minutes. Because it was coming down at an angle and when it disappeared, it had that characteristic of a falling star.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a handwritten text describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object. The text mentions that the object was seen through the viewer of a polaroid camera, but no image is included in this document.

Output of the text in the document:

August through the viewer of a Polaroid camera. It could be the object moving or it could have been the object going into or out of the camera. The camera the object moved rapidly. It could have been an accident for the reel not being moved slightly is that I moved the camera slightly action I seen it move and it disappeared. It was about 20 feet away from me. It was about 6 to 8 inches in diameter. There should be no detective clues across as the camera exposed to light for test exposure intended to be made was made.
