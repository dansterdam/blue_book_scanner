10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Observer was watching jet A/C fly into vicinity of sun. Rocket shaped object came out and disappeared into hazy cloud near the sun. Object had metal scaly surface and was described by observer as a rocket AMS ship. After observation, witness went into home and told friends only that he had seen a UFO. No attempt to get confirming witness.

11. COMMENTS
Entire observation centered in and around the sun. Venus was within 3 degrees of the sun at this time. Also the jet A/C observed was not reported as leaving. Added to the observers reluctance to call attention of the object to another person so near, it is believed that the object an optical phenomena associated with staring at the sun. CAFEC (ATIC)

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

I went over my Brother's Home, who lives in Danvers Mass. We talked to a while after he said what you go out and see in town. Then I told him I would go out and make some calls. I was driving with him. I shot one of your jets & sky I watched jet and the time. I heard one of your jets fly by. About my the time in a south 25 D. direction as my heads were on the side of my face to shield out the light of the sun. On I was still looking up. Altitude about 12000 ft. in the other direction, out of the sun came this a strange, nearly shape of seen anything like this before. I could make out part of its side then. I could trace in the middle + the walls. Slope from the side for the curve as if it had rocket tubes on the side. They were moving something of other way of flying. They were moving in my anything coming way of the looks of it. Which seems of strange the way it was quite about me; was very slow they rocket. They continued in the time for about 10 mins. That is my of know it was 12 or 12:30 noon. I did not see anything for sure. I was...

Dear Sir:

I am writing you this letter because my mind has not been at ease since this all took place, and I helped the war on. I wrote to Mrs. CAP. about it and sent them a clipping of another story in the paper of a UFO. I know you people are afraid too tell the public about these things on account of what might happen. But I still say things you all need to know. I look treatment for who knows why it will do not more good than harm. My story begins as that I tried to talk

I saw I saw. On June 29/60
I went down to my brother's
house he lives in
Mass. on
He told me to set out side
and I told in some time as
he would make as some dinner
so I did. I heard one of your
jet planes go by and the
trail of white left it
went by this time. I watched
it still I could not see it
or hear it. My hands were
on the side of my face to
shield the sky of this sun

saw the shimmy of thing
seeming to have some right
out of the beam. And now my
plane as I it made a slight
turn I could make out
first of its side, it had
an indentation in the middle
of it and scallop shape like
tubes so far from the side
to the back. It was of
metallic aspect and was
wonderfully made of what
I saw of it. And I know
we had nothing of any thing
like this before. It was
in a slight haze of a cloud over
the town barely in a northly
direction. I saw it about to
a 45° angle, I did not tell
