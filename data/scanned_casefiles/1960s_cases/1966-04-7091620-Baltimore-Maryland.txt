appeared to maintain these an
altitude from the time they were
spotted until they disappeared from
our line of vision.

It seems that there was a
reason behind their pattern of
flying at progressively higher
altitude, as the night went on.
It appears to indicate that they
were purposely avoiding the direct
rays of the sun to present their
silhouette seem. It did not appear
that the purpose of their flight
was to rise with the sun. However,
we can say with reasonable
certainty that as they had some con-
trol of their altitude, they had some
destination. Assuming that they
were situated at all seems rather
far fetched. However, to anyone who
knew them, I am sure this possibility
is not too unbelievable.

The diagram seems to be a hand-drawn representation of something, possibly a UFO movement or trajectory pattern.

I apologize, but the text on this page appears to be written in a cursive or handwritten script that is extremely difficult to read. While the writing covers most of the page, the specific characters and words are not clearly discernible.

Dear Colonel de Jonckheare:

Reference is made to your letter dated June 17, 1966, subject:
UFO Sighting, 25 April 1966, Baltimore, Maryland.

At 0015 GMT, April 25, 1966, a Controller on duty in the Tower
reported "a bright greenish-white fire ball with orange tail
observed north of the airport descending". This was also reported by pilots of several aircraft in the vicinity. Subsequent
newspaper stories indicated that it was identified as a Gemini
For verification we suggest you check with the United States
Weather Bureau.

No other unusual objects were reported.

Sincerely yours,

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

Reference your unidentified observation of 25 April 1966. The information is your letter was not sufficient for evaluation. Request you complete the attached FTD Form 164 and return it in the envelope provided.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:                July 1 1966
                                                                Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The questions that you asked were very detailed. In my original report, there were a great number of objects sighted in groups hovering from 5 to well 70 to 80 objects have groups flying directly from 20 to 100 or more in number. Arranged in a group at the same way roughly in V or boomerang shaped formation. During the roughly one and one-half hours of sighting, the objects appeared to fly at progressively higher altitude. There were ten groups and all were moving. These were beyond a form actually referring to one object or several objects at one sighting. I hope that this answers your need.

* As the altitude of the object groups progressively seemed to become higher, this size of the object seemed, of course, to diminish. At the bottom of the groups, the average was not quite to answer question # 3. The first group of objects was in the same pattern. Clouds were at the bottom, but as the might rise on this sighting, we were moving for about 30 seconds.

UFO Sighting, 25 April 1966, Baltimore, Maryland

FAA
Friendship Airport
Baltimore, Maryland 21240

1. This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report regarding a sighting in the Baltimore area on 25 April 1966. Between 2100 and 2230 EDT an observer watched ten different groups of objects flying in a "V" shape formation from East to West. There were approximately 150 - 200 objects in all, each group was at a different altitude.

2. From the available information we feel that birds are responsible for the sighting. Information is needed from the radar section as to whether they had anything on radar that would resemble birds. If there was anything unusual on radar for that night we would appreciate knowing about it. If there was nothing unusual on radar for that night we would like a statement to that effect.

April 26, 1966

Dear Sir:

I am writing to report an incident with a sighting of flying objects that my mother and I made on the evening of Monday, April 25. This sighting is not the same as the widely reported meteor sighting of that same night.

Attached is a detailed report of my observations which took place between 9:00 and 10:30 on that evening. There was a great deal of difficulty in finding out of anyone else in the Baltimore area saw these objects besides my mother and I. The sky was so brilliantly clear at the time of the sighting that it was hard to imagine that no one else saw them. I had an equal amount of difficulty in reporting my observations by phone with the proper authorities. As a matter of fact, I was not able to find and until today with the proper authorities and I am sure that this will be the first time you were delicately accompanied with photo evidence from the person.

I apologize, but the text appears to be in a handwritten script that is not easily legible.
