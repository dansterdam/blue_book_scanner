Unidentified Flying
Objects Reports,

December 25, 1962

Gentlemen:

This sighting was made Tuesday morning,
between 4:30 and 4:40, December 18, 1962. the
U.F.O. was nearest a star — or planet — about
45° above the horizon due East of Huntington,
W.Va.

The star — or planet — I will refer to it as a
star, is not known to me. But, it may be identif-
ied as follows: it rises during the early morning
hours about mid-way around the horizon between
the Big Dipper and the rising point of the Morning
Star. It is a rapid traveler, reaches about 45° above
the horizon between 4 A.M. and 4:30 A.M., approaches
its zenith about dawn and fades out well before
the Morning Star. Rating the Morning Star as No. 1 in
size, brilliance and visibility, this star ranks
about No. 3 or No. 4.

The U.F.O. was visible to me as a point of
light, ranking about No. 4 or No. 5 in size, brilliance
and visibility, next to the star I use as a locator
point.

I first noticed the U.F.O. while looking at the
star and wondered about a star of that size in that
location. I did not recall ever having seen as star of
that size that close and paid particular attention

to both bodies. the U.F.O. was motionless for a
short time -- not more than 5 minutes -- then
suddenly moved down and south toward the star
I use as a locater point as in the diagram
(UFO)

Read on a clock face, you could say that the U.F.O.
moved in a dead straight line from 11 o'clock to 5
o'clock on path C-D bisecting the light field of
Star A. the distance traveled below the star was
considerably more than the distance traveled above it.
It reached a point about 30° above the horizon then
disappeared in the mist and fog.

Weather conditions: Clear, cool, a half-moon, some

stars, ground mist and haze which commonly hangs
over the Ohio Valley.

Observation time: About 4:30 A.M. Motionless for
the first few minutes—not more than 5 minutes. In
motion for a few minutes—not more than 5 minutes.
Disappeared at 4:40 A.M. South and East of its flight
line.

Observation point: An East window, top floor, Main
office — the West Virginia Works, Connors Steel
Div. of H.H. Porter Co. Inc. North-East sector of
Huntington, W.Va.

Note: the U.F.O. was too far away to see either
tail, superstructure or vapor trail. It was
visible only as a point of light which so
much resembled a star I first took it to
be one.

Sincerely,
Huntington 1, W.Va.
