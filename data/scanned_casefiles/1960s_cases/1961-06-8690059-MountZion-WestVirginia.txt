APCN-39/Major Friend 
Unidentified Flying Objects
Mr. 
West Virginia
June 23, 1961

Reference your letter of 13 June 1961 to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center concerning certain sightings reported from your home in November 1957 and June 1961.

These sightings of unidentified aerial objects you forwarded with your original letter have been carefully identified and designated CONFIDENTIAL by the United States Air Force. Copies are being returned.

These objects were dropped in the United States by the Air Force for the purposes of training pilots and radar crews and for testing the equipment of the Chain Reaction Satellite.

Chain Reaction is designed to interface with radars of different specifications. These objects are usually released from the aircraft in bundles which open to allow the individual piece of chain to fall alone. On occasion, however, individual pieces of chain will fall alone.

This material is designed to fall extremely slow, and therefore any impression of extreme speed in its descent is not realistic. Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

FRED J. EVANS
Deputy for Science
and Instrumentation

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter dated June 13, 1961, addressed to Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. The letter is from an Astro Intelligence Officer and discusses a sighting of a UFO that occurred about four years earlier in November 1957. The letter provides details about the sighting, including the size, shape, and behavior of the object. The letter also expresses appreciation for any information the recipient can provide and thanks them for their assistance.

Dear Sir:

About four years ago in November, 1957, there occurred a sighting of a "metallic object" by several civilian witnesses in the Mount Zion, West Virginia area. 

On Friday, June 9, 1961, a friend of mine who lives about 12 miles from Mount Zion called to inform me that a copy of a letter dated June, 1961, had come into his possession. This letter described the object witnessed in November, 1957 as being about one mile in diameter, circular in shape, and making a high-pitched whining sound. The object was observed for a long time and maneuvered around slowly and erratically in hopes of landing. 

I would greatly appreciate any information about these incidents. As to the reasons for my interest, I am currently completing a study on certain aspects of the UFO phenomenon, and more particularly, the November, 1957 sighting in the Mount Zion, West Virginia area.

Again, your considerations and any additional information you would be able to provide would be appreciated. 

By avoiding your reply, thanking you, I remain

Mount Zion, West Virginia
