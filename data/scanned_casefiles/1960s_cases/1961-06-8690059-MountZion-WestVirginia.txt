ADIC-42/Major Friend
Unidentified Flying Objects
Mr. [redacted]
West Virginia

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Reference your letter of 13 June 1961 to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center requesting information about metallic divers which were found near your home in November 1957 and June 1961.

The samples of the material which you forwarded with your letter have been definitely identified as chaff made and utilized by the United States. Chaff is material which is dropped by our aircraft for the purpose of jamming radars by blocking out scope picture with insignificant returns.

Chaff is dropped in the United States by the Air Force for the purposes of training flight and radar crews and for testing the effectiveness of the chaff itself.

Chaff is designed to interfere with radars of different operating frequencies, and this accounts for the differences in length and cross section of the material which was found near your home.

Chaff is usually released from the aircraft in bundles which then open to allow the material to disperse. In an optimum operation each individual piece of chaff will fall alone. On occasion, however, the several will fall in little clumps such as you recovered.

The material is designed to fall extremely slow, and therefore may have been dropped many miles from your home and drifted into your area during the time it took to fall from approximately eight miles high.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
PHILIP G. EVANS
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Science

Attn: Intelligence Officer

Dear Sir:

About four years ago in November, 1957, three companions and myself found a very neat piles or metallic silver-colored slivers in a wooded area about one-mile from my home in Calhoun County, West Virginia. The slivers, a few of which are enclosed, marked November, 1957), were about seven inches long and lay undisturbed and entangled in bonfire fashion. They had not fallen from any height or they would have scattered. The slivers were perfectly straight.

Friday, June 9, 1961, a friend of mine, who lives about seven miles away, found an identical pile of slivers, except they were shorter. Again about 25 inches long. Again they were in a neat pile and in such a manner as described in the other case. Enclosed you will find these slivers in an envelope marked June, 1961.

I have been unable to find any definitive answer particularly as to the usage of these slivers, and more particularly how they became located here in such a manner. I have read and do have copies of an article describing the finding of these type slivers elsewhere. Griffis Air Force Base in Rome received some in 1956.

I would greatly appreciate any information about these slivers as to composition, usage, and why they would be found in such neat piles at infrequent times.

Again, a more authoritative answer would be appreciated. I will be awaiting your reply. Thanking you, I remain

Sincerely,
Mount Zion, West Virginia
