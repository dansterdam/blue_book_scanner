Date: August 20, 1967

To: Project Bluebook

I saw a flying saucer over my house, 6800 Oakland St. during a rain storm at around 11:30 in the morning.

The object was going east and was about 250 feet from myself.

This object zipped right by me and unfortunately I did not see the shape nor the color.

I am a very good observer of objects in the sky and thus it was not an airplane. It was much too small for my eyesight. I saw the object about 4 minutes and only I saw it. (Equal nights for all UFO organizations.)

Please believe me, this is "absolutely true" and not a hoax. I am entering College in February and the fact that I am not a drank person by any means.
