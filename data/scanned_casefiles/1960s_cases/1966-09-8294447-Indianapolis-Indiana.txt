PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 16 September 66 17/0452

2. LOCATION: Indianapolis, Indiana (1 Witness)

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: NE

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Astro (CAPELLA) [with handwritten notes: "Prob. despite utterance of closeness 878"]

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer noted object that was gold in color. There was no smoke or any kind of a vapor trail noted. Object looked like the sun reflecting off of a mirror. Object came in sight, paused as if it was looking for something on the earth. The object did disappear while the observer was watching it.

With the available information Capella seems a likely answer. The co-server did report some movement of the alleged UFO; however, this is commonly reported with astronomical observation.
