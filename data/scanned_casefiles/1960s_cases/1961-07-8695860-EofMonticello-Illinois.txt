J. There was a Comanche type light aircraft inbound from South Carolina which landed approximately 2200 local.

k. Course supervisor, minuteman maintenance officers course. After checking with the University of Illinois airport control tower manager, the student flight scheduling of U of I and the flightline mechanic, I was able to conclude that it was a transient Comanche circling for a landing at the U of I airport. The mechanic said he thought this Comanche had an additional landing light. The double landing lights on the Comanche are located out in the wing tips. The double 12-ps on each wing tip plus the nose light would account for the three lights. The pilot of the aircraft probably turned on his lights to give him tower his position while requesting landing instructions in his circling near the field. A statement that the lights did not change their relative position to the car could be due to the car carefully looking at 50 to 60 mph. The aircraft was probably beginning to turn from a west to east heading and its ground speed was approximately the same as the car.

Each observer said they couldn't see any other lights. The lights were seen for approximately two minutes and when they went out, there was a few moments of night blindness during which time the aircraft probably passed to the rear and out of sight through the windshield. The observers said they heard no sound. The window on the left side was rolled up.

The road was in very poor surface condition. He drove it at 55 mph and it would have been extremely difficult to have heard an aircraft under those conditions. I was unable to talk to the lower operator to see if he received any details of the Comanche's landing pattern. The serial number of the Comanche is 11 7375*. It came from South Carolina and a/c of I and F for refueling and later departed prior to the investigation.

This image appears to be a map, primarily showing an area around Chicago with various roads, highways, and grid lines. The map is in black and white and seems to be part of a document related to a specific location or route. Some text is visible, but most is too small to read clearly. There are some markings and annotations on the map, and it looks like an official document or report map. The bottom right corner seems to have some partial text, but it is not fully legible from this image.

The image appears to be a map of Illinois, showing county boundaries and road networks. The map is in black and white and appears to be a detailed county map with numerous grid lines and subdivisions. The letters "E" and "O" are visible at the top of the map, and the map covers the entire state of Illinois with its intricate network of roads and county lines.

Dear Sirs:

This is the information given to me.

On July 15, 1961 about 4 miles east of Monticello, Illinois on Highway 36, people were in a car in a highway and saw in the sky, about 500 ft. night three lights traveling through the sky, to the north. The time in the evening was about 9:45 P.M. In the 14 lights were two in front and 1 setting at an angle, about 30 to 50 ft. away from one other 14 in the same which keep setting a little closer to the two lights in front. When the two light in front began to catch up with the front light, they all begin to fade out and the last the people saw of them was about 15 feet of the earth. The lights were real light white in color.
