11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer reported to the duty officer that he had seen a UFO twice. The first time he saw it for 3 minutes and the second time he saw it for 2 minutes. Apparently the first time it was orange in color and the second time red. The observer said it would look like the rays from a flashlight.

COMMENTS: No course is given. Only a single time is listed (20:45) as the time of the sighting. There seems to be no indication of why the observer thought it was the same object, that he saw the second time. The observer was requested to give more information but did not return the form 117.
