THE LIGHT WAS HOVERING THIS LIGHT IS SEVERAL FEET OFF GROUND. I THOUGHT WAS THE TOP OF A LARGE TOWER DEAD IN FRONT OF US. WHEN I REALIZED IT WAS NOT A TOWER I BECAME QUITE EXCITED PACING US. WHEN BOTH THE LIGHT PACING US ONE CAR WERE OPPOSITE TOWARD TAMPA, WE FLASHING RED LIGHTS STOPPED NEAR THE TOWER. THERE WAS A SLOWLY MOVED TOWARD US BANKING + DIPPING AND PASSED OVER CAR. IT HAD THEN LEFT CAR WE (INAUDIBLE BUT COULD HEAR NOTHING THREE WAS NOTHING) THE TOWER WAS GOING TOWARD US. WE HAD FOLLOWED ROAD OF TOP AND ALMOST BUT NOT QUITE STOPPED.

We had just returned from delivering a rented car (have rental receipt sure of date) visiting house my wife and I. Parked on the side of the road. Watched it for approx 5 min. It was high in the sky over or near south edge of Rochester, N.Y. It was just a small flashing red light doing a fantastic jig in the sky. We both felt we were watching a UFO and were fascinated. We told family only and soon forgot about it.

Here is the text from the document:

Was driving from Lima, NY to E. Avon, NY. On RT 5 + 20 I had done many times before, when I first noticed something strange. That early night maybe 8:32 smiles higher than tr[illegible] my attention because it was higher than the street lights and did not take. When I was perhaps 1/2 mile from it, it slowly started to move south at 10 or 15 degrees. I pulled off to side of road, on patrol off and watched it slowly move away towards the south until it disappeared over crest of hill. Seemed mean he seemed. I wanted to follow it but there were no side roads close by so I proceeded on home. There was on traffic on road but no one else stopped and looked at it.

I told wife and family that I felt unique have seen a UFO but we all agreed that it was probably a helicopter.

This incident kept no permanent impress, on my mind, in other words, I considered it unusual but very easily explainable.

I was driving from Batavia, N.Y. to E. Avon, N.Y. Enroute, started to notice a January light many times before when the first notice bird street lights and did not move. When perhaps 1/2 mile from it, it slowly started to move south, at some low altitude. When I drew abreast of it, I pulled off to side of road, so motor off and watched it slowly move away towards the south until it disappeared over crest of hill. Could hear no sound. I wanted to follow it but there were no side roads so I proceeded on home. There was only traffic on road but no one else stopped and I have seen a UFO but we all agreed that it was probably a helicopter.

This incident left no permanent impression, in my mind. In other words, I considered it very easily explainable.

UFO Reports, Mr. Frank M. Quinlan

646th Tactical Airlift Wing
Attn: DON/1st Lt Signalg

1. Reference your undated letter in which you forwarded unidentified
flying object (UFO) reports of July or August 1967, 12 January 1968,
20 February 1968 and 21 February 1968 by [redacted] of
Avon, New York.

2. None of these reports were submitted in accordance with AFR 80-17
and changes thereto. We will accept this report but will return any
future reports that are not properly investigated. Because of the
number of UFOs that Mr. [redacted] has observed, the reliability of any
report made by him is questionable.

Avon, New York
April 20, 1968

David J. Signiego, Lt, USAF
Intelligence Officer
Deputy Commander for Operations
Attn. OF; DOIN

Dear Sir,

Enclosed find reports on UFO's. I honestly thought that the NICAP might be a front for the Government, so on my recent trip down, I stopped and gave them an oral report which I forbade them to publish but lost all confidence in them when I felt they told an untruth.

As you probably already know, I received quite a run-around in Fayetteville and am grateful to Mr. Vencell, the CID man for finally breaking down.

At the time, those incidents seemed excitingly interesting and it wasn't till we had returned home and slowed down a bit that they began to bother me to the point where I had to be sure that the night people, whoever they were, knew about them. I did make an attempt at reporting them on our return home by stopping at a State Trooper's barracks but I couldn't get anyone to answer the doors.

The questions that plague me today are these:
Why were we approached, personally, twice and maybe a third time at such a distance from one another? If it was just by chance, there would have to be an enormous number of these things around and then the odds would be against it considering the great number of cars on the road. I believe that it was personal and in trying to figure out why we were approached, here are the conclusions that the difference between us and the majority of other cars on the road at that time are as follows:

We were young people where, I would imagine, the majority of other cars contained older people (Florida tourists). We didn't panic, show great fear, run to the police, etc. In other words we just kept going, but if I had had any idea that we would have again ended up on lonely stretches of road the following night, we would have stopped at dusk. Heck was, we arrived in Sarasota at midnight, were informed that there wasn't a room in the state of Florida and ended up sleeping in the car.

Our oldest girl is a diabetic and we would give her a shot of insulin around 8 or 9 every night.

I would like, if possible, to discuss this further with someone who has knowledge of the patterns, if any, these objects follow on their close approaches to humans, possible after-effects of a close approach, etc. Being self-employed, my time is my own and I would be willing to go any reasonable distance to talk to someone.

In reference to the 1967 and Jan. 1968 incidents, I don't know of anyone around here who might be interested in them except the newspapers, so, unless they mean something to you, you can throw them away as far as I'm concerned.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]
