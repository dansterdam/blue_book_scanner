1 APRIL 1968  

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. CM ------ 11 REPORT THE FIRST TIME ANYTHING UNUSUAL -------- HAPPENED. ON THE EVE OF 1 APRIL 1968, ALONE IN THE HOUSE,   THE CAT AND I OBSERVED AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND PENETRATING LIGHT COMING FROM OUTSIDE. UPON LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW WHICH FACED NORTH, I SAW A BRILLIANT CIRCULAR LIGHT, LIKE A LARGE STAR, HOVERING ABOUT 1,000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FULL MOON AND BRILLIANT WHITE IN COLOR. PULSATING RAPIDLY FROM VERY BRIGHT TO DIMMER, IT SEEMED TO BE GETTING BRIGHTER WITH EACH PULSATION. AT NO TIME DID IT REMAIN STEADILY BRIGHT OR DIM. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING IN ONE SPOT AND DID NOT MOVE AT ALL DURING THE APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES I WATCHED IT. AS SOON AS I OBSERVED IT, I BECAME EXTREMELY EXCITED AND APPREHENSIVE. I QUICKLY GRABBED FOR MY EYEGLASSES AND PEERED OUT THE WINDOW AGAIN. IT WAS STILL THERE, PULSATING BRIGHTLY. I THEN HURRIEDLY WENT TO GET MY WIFE, WHO WAS ASLEEP IN THE BEDROOM. AWAKENING HER, I EXCITEDLY TOLD HER TO COME AND LOOK. BY THE TIME SHE CAME TO THE WINDOW, THE OBJECT HAD DISAPPEARED. SHE WAS RATHER SKEPTICAL AND FELT THAT I HAD BEEN DREAMING. I WAS QUITE DISTURBED BY THE INCIDENT AND FELT THAT IT WAS SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL AND ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. ALTHOUGH I HAVE SEEN AIRCRAFT, SATELLITES AND METEORS IN THE PAST, THIS WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING I HAD EVER OBSERVED BEFORE. THE PULSATING LIGHT AND EXTREME BRILLIANCE, COMBINED WITH ITS HOVERING MOTIONLESS POSITION, MADE ME FEEL THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT OR OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENON. I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT WHAT I SAW WAS NOT IMAGINARY OR A DREAM. IT WAS REAL AND DEFINITELY SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL AND OUT OF THE ORDINARY. MY PRINCIPAL REASON FOR REPORTING THIS SIGHTING IS THAT I FEEL IT MAY HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANCE OR IMPORTANCE TO YOUR INVESTIGATION. ALSO, I HOPE THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN OR IDENTIFY WHAT I ACTUALLY SAW.

The text on the page reads as follows:

"29 Dec 68. It was a strange and inexplicable happening. At about 2150 hrs, we were watching tv, when the electricity in the house went off. It came on again about 5 to 10 minutes later. During this time, my wife and I both saw what appeared to be a very bright red light that seemed to be dancing, not too high in the sky, near the edge of our 20 acre field. 
The light was to our right, a little to the west, and was very intense, larger than a star or planet, and appeared to be pulsating or moving erratically. It moved about for several minutes before fading out.
We both felt we were watching a UFO and were fascinated by it.
The weather was clear and cold, and there was no wind. The field was carpeted with about 6 inches of snow, and the house lights and tv set were the only illumination around at the time.
I was just a simple-looking red light, dancing about, much brighter than anything else in the sky. It was just a strange and fantastic-looking sight.
We both felt we were watching a UFO and were fascinated by it.
Avon, New York"

Diving from Atrium, N.Y. to E. Avon, N.Y. on (BLOT) 8-2-70. At about 3:15 to 3:30 P.M. I noticed a strange object in the clear blue sky. At first I thought is was an airplane but as I watched it, it made no noise and was traveling much faster than any plane I have ever seen. It would dart up, down, and across the sky. It was silvery in color and was about the size of a large automobile. There was no smoke or exhaust visible. It appeared to be metallic and was reflecting the sunlight. I watched it for about 3 - 4 minutes before it disappeared from sight. There was no traffic on the road at the time and no one else around to see it. I have seen a UFO before and I felt that what I saw was definately a UFO. I felt that the family that I have seen a UFO before and we all called what we saw a helicopter, but I don't think that is true. On my mind I have no permanent impression, but very frasile explainable.

1. Reference your undated letter in which you forwarded unidentified flying object (UFO) reports of 30 July 1967, 12 January 1968 and 21 February 1968 by (name redacted).

Text from the document:

David J. Signalco, Lt, USAF
Intelligence Officer
Deputy Commander for Operations
Attn: OS; DOIN

Dear Sir,

SUBJECT: Find reports on UFO's. I honestly thought that the NICAP might be a front for the government, so on my recent trip down, I stopped and gave them an oral report which I wondered to publish. I found that conditions in them were as I felt they told me an untruth.

As you already know, I received quite a run-around in Fayetteville and am grateful to Mr. Vinsell, the "old man" for finally breaking down.

At the time, these incidents seemed startlingly interesting and it was't till we had returned home and discussed them that we began to bother me to the point where I had to be sure that the right people who ever they were, knew about them.

I did make an attempt to reconcile some of the rumors that I had heard by responding at a State Dept. press conference and found the doors slammed in my face.

The questions that plague me today are these:

Why were we approached, personally, twice and maybe a third time at such a distance and amidst a number of these things around and then the odds would be against us? It indicates not only a curiosity on their part but a deliberate plan of some degree, on our part. Is it going to be the case that they are able to out-maneuver everything that we can put up against them?

The other matter is the relationship between us and the majority of other cars on the road that time. We were pacing people where I would like to know, contained older people (Florida tourists), we didn't paint, wore shorts, car was a cream colored Ford, ran to the police, etc. In other words, we just kept going, but if I had any idea that he would have again added up to an encounter with these things, we would have stopped. He, I mean the occupant of the Ford next to us, appeared as a dull, lethargic lump. This also gets me.

I would like, if possible, to discuss this further with someone who has knowledge of the subject. Is any of these objects hostile? Can we tell by the actions? Some of the time is my own and I would be willing to go any reasonable distance to talk to someone.

In reference to the 1927 and Jan. 1968 incidents, I don't know of any-one around here who might be interested in those except to mean something to you. You can throw them away as far as I'm concerned.

Sincerely,

The image contains a photograph that appears to be a page from a project Blue Book UFO report document. The page includes various questions and prompts related to analyzing UFO sightings, as well as a compass-like diagram and a space for drawing a sketch of the motion and path of observed objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curved line to show where the object was when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The text output from the document is as follows:
