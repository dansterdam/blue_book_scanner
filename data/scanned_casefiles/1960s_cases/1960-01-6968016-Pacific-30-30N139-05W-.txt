1. A CURVIS report was originated by the commander of a Navy R7V-1 aircraft, Bureau No. 44051, of VR-7, stationed at U. S. Naval Air Station, Norfolk Field, California. This aircraft, under the operational control of Military Air Transport Service, departed Hickam Air Force Base at 102°27Z January 1960 for Travis Air Force Base, arriving Travis at 110°402. Flight number of the aircraft was PGA 660 of 11 January. Cargo only was carried on this flight, no passengers. On instructions received from the Commander Western Sea Frontier, an agent of the District Intelligence Officer, Twelfth Naval District, in support of the Commander, Central Sector, Western Sea Frontier (Commandant, Twelfth Naval District), interviewed the individuals who observed the unidentified flying object when they arrived at U. S. Naval Air Station, Moffett Field, during the morning of 11 January.

2. The information obtained from these individuals is as follows:

a. The time the object was sighted was 110.382 January. Position was 20-30 North, 139-05 West. The aircraft was making good a course of 073 degrees true at a speed of 235 knots. The position of the aircraft had been fired accurately eight minutes earlier at 0.302 when in the vicinity of Ocean Station Vessel NOVEMBER. The weather in the vicinity of the aircraft was described as clear with unlimited visibility. The aircraft was above an overcast which extended to the 9,000-foot level. The aircraft later entered an overcast area in the vicinity of longitude 134-30 West. No other aircraft were observed nor known to be in the area.

b. James A. HAUSER, 283 28 20, ATC, USN, residing at 1595 Bayshore, Garden Court, Santa Clara, California, first observed the object. At the time, he was occupying the copilot's seat on the starboard side forward of the aircraft. Then he first observed it, the object was slightly aft of the aircraft and approximately 30 degrees higher than the aircraft. It was irregular, but roughly round, in shape, about half the size of a

full moon. He further described it as similar to a very bright white
light with an irregular edge. He estimated its speed as about one-third
that of a falling star. As it moved, the object constantly decreased in
size until it disappeared in a position forward and about 30 degrees above
the aircraft. The object appeared to move in a straight line during the
10 to 15 seconds it was under observation.

b. Ensign John S. STEWART, USN, 649514, who resides at 808 Iris
Avenue, Sunnyvale, California, observed the object then it was brought
to his attention by Chief HANGER, At the time, Ensign STEWART was
occupying the pilot's seat, port side forward. Normally Ensign STEWART
is copilot (second pilot) for the aircraft. At the time he first observed
the object he maintained it to be an approximately 0/50 relative to the
aircraft, and to be above the aircraft. As he watched, he observed it
to be on a flat trajectory and moving slowly. It appeared to be round
in appearance and white in color, approximately 15 to 20 times larger
than a planet. The object continued to move in a slightly downward
course, decreasing in size until it disappeared from sight ahead of the
aircraft. To was unable to determine whether or not the object was
approaching the aircraft or going away. He estimated the time he observed
the object to be 12 seconds. His impression of the object in general was
comparable to that of Chief HANGER, except that it appeared to be more
solid, lacking the irregularity in the edges described by Chief HANGER.

Ensign STEWART commented he had observed a similar object while on route
from Travis to Hickam about a month earlier and had been interviewed
relative to that sighting by the Air Force upon arrival at Hickam. He
compared the object sighted on the previous occasion as being larger
than the one sighted on this occasion, but the previous object had been
bluish white whereas this one was white. Ensign STEWART also commented
that the original CJWIS message had indicated the estimated course of
the object as about 310 degrees, but this could be in considerable
error, and probably the course was in a more northerly direction.

c. At the time of the observation the radar for the aircraft was
not in operation, precluding confirmation of the presence of the object
through use of radar. Both persons observed the object without binocu-
lars.

d. An unsuccessful attempt was made to report the sighting to
Comm Station Vessel HYUBANKS, A CJWIS message via Flick to Cotellen
Air Force Base and was acknowledged at 110503Z January.

3. Ensign G. R. NELSON, Officer Personnel Officer for VF-67, advised
that Ensign STEWART had entered naval service in November 1957 in an

enlisted status, and had reached the rate of AD2 (Aviation Machinist Mate,
Second Class) when he was selected for the NAVRAD Program, which resulted
in his commissioning. Since being assigned to VF-7 in March 1959, he
has progressed adequately professionally and is well regarded by the
members of his squadron, both professionally and personally. He is
somewhat older than most insignia, being 29 years old. Lieutenant (jg)
John F. JACKSON, Enlisted Personnel Officer for VF-7, advised that
Chief HAUSER is just completing 20 years of service in the Navy, and
will soon retire to the Fleet Reserve. Chief HAUSER enjoys an excellent
personal and professional reputation in the squadron; his rating marks
are consistently "Excellent."  He has been on duty with VF-7 since 1954.

4. Fleet Weather Facility Alameda (U. S. Naval Air Station, Alameda)
airland weather conditions in the vicinity of OOV HOWARD, near the
position of the sighting at 110600Z, were as follows:

Altitude (ft)   Wind Speed (knots)   Wind Direction (degrees)
Surface         Not reported          750
6,000           8                     350
10,000          9                     210
16,000          22                    340
20,000          44                    270
30,000          22                    290
38,000          35                    300

Further, there was heavy cloud cover in the area, cumulus clouds,
which may have extended to 13,000 feet (location of this 13,000-foot
cloud cover may have variation of up to 5 degrees longitude). Also,
there was a very good chance of thunderstorms in the area with this
with possible precipitation and lightning.

5. The Commander Western Sea Frontier was advised of the results of the
interview of Ensign STEWART and Chief HAUSER through local liaison on
11 January.
