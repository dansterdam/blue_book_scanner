1. A CIRVIS report was originated by the commander of a Navy RTV-1 aircraft, Bureau No. 44651, of VR-7, stationed at U.S. Naval Air Station, North Island, California. This aircraft made contact with "an unidentified flying object" at 11:04:32 January 1960 for Travis Air Force Base, arriving Travis at 11:05:02. This contact was FM 650 of 11 January. No cargo only was carried on this flight, no passengers. Information received from the Commander Western Sea Frontier indicated that the unidentified flying object was sighted to the south of the Commandant, Twelfth Naval District, information when they arrived at U.S. Naval Air Station, Moffett Field, during the morning of 11 January.
2. The information obtained from these individuals is as follows:
a. The time the object was sighted was 11:04:32 January. Position 30-30 North, 139-05 East. The altitude was making good a course of 073 degrees true at a speed of 335 knots. The position of the aircraft was then approximately 40 miles southeast of the object and had been overtaking it. The aircraft commander estimated the size of the object to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter.
b. James A. HAUER, 283 23 20, ATC, USN, residing at 1325 Bayshore, Gadsden Court, Suisun City, California, first observed the object. At the time, he was occupying the copilot's seat on the starboard side toward the rear of the aircraft. Upon the first observed sighting, the object was slightly off from the aircraft and approximately 30 degrees higher than the aircraft. It was irregular in shape and smoother than the aircraft.

CASE: Unidentified flying object report of sighthing at 1145Z, 30 Jan 60 or full moon with an irregular edge. No aircraft was involved. The object was first sighted at approximately 1148 white in color approached to about 20 degrees elevations and then suddenly disappeared in a position forward and about 30 degrees above the horizon. The object was observed for about 5 to 10 seconds.

1. Ensign John S. STEWART, USN, 626914, who resides at 208 Tenth Avenue, Sunnyvale, California, observed the object when it was brought to his attention by Lt. Cmdr J.M. SMITH, USN, who was also present at the time.

2. The object was described as being about the size of a half dollar held at arm's length, circular in shape, white in color, brightly lighted, and traveling in a straight course. It appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 15,000 to 20,000 feet and could be seen for a period of 5 to 10 seconds. Ensign STEWART commented he had observed a similar object while on route to HAAS from Hawaii relative to his sighting. His observation was similar to that sighted by the Air Force upon arrival at Hickam. He considers this the most significant and unusual visual object he has observed in his nearly 3 years of service.

3. At the time of the observation the radar for the aircraft was in operation, but the reception of the object was not indicated through the use of radar. Both persons observed the object without binocular aid.

4. An unsuccessful attempt was made to report the sighting by Coast Station vessel NVNBARK. A CINCPAC message was filed to indicate the sighting.

5. Ensign G. R. NELSON, OFFICER Personnel Officer for VR-7, advised that Ensign STEWART had reported naval service in December 1957 in an

Subject: Unidentified flying objects: report of sighting at 1104382 JAN 60 gr. paralrited sighting, and had reached tbs rats cf AD2 (Aviation Machinist's Mate, 2nd
Class) during his tour of duty. This sighting vas considered for the UJAP program, hich resulted in his commiesioning. Since being assigned to VF-7 in March 1956, he
has constantly been actively engaged in the observation of flying objects which regarded by the members of his squadron, both professionally and personally. He is
extremely reliable, of good judgement, and is considered to be highly intelligent (I2), John J. JADISON, enlisted personnel officer for VF-7, advised that
this individual was always on the alert for unidentified objects while on visual reconnaissance and other such missions. His flying and observation record has been
superior and hears out his personal and professional reputation in the squadron: his flying record
was outstanding "Distinction". He has been on duty with VF-7 since 1954.

4. Pilot: Weathar Facility Alameda (U. S. Naval Air Station, Alameda)
sited weather conditions at the vicinity of sighting at 1106002 wore as follows: 

Altitude (ft.) Wind Speed (knots) Wind Direction (degrees)
15,000 25 250
16,000 27 250
18,000 22 260 
20,000 44 270
22,000 33 260
25,000 35 300

Further, there was a layer of cloud cover 1500 feet to the area, cumiliformation clouds,
which may have extended to 13,000 feet (location of this 13,000-foot cloud cover mentioned in item 3 degrees longitude). Also, there was a very good chance of thunderstorms in the area at that time
with possible precipitation and lightning.

5. The Commander-Western Sea Frontier was advised of the results of the interview of the
Interests of BUENG and other AGENCIES SPECIAL REPORTS on 11 January.
