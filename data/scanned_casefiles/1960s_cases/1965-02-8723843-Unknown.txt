Report on UFO --- February 13, 1965

Today at 4:44 P.M. I saw a formation of UFO's flying at a speed of about 4000 miles per hour flying at an altitude of about 30 miles. The formation was V shaped. There were about six saucers. The saucers were moving due north and then met up with two more " making eight saucers. The saucers were of a bluish white color. There. They were about 100 feet in diameter but I couldn't tell very well at that altitude. Then, they disappeared into the horizon.

Yours truly,
