Dear Sir:-
Because of an unusual sighting and being our year
near material is now held meaningful, I would like to
report the following incident:-

On the evening of 14 Nov 64 @ approx. 21:40 hrs.
while staying the cottillion with 2-10yr. old girls,
their aunt and a Dr. Rudy Mathis at there were of a
violence (73rd St. and Burleigh - Milwaukee) - three,
reddish-black objects, in a straight line in a N-S
axis, appeared in the western sky in the area
between Durign and the Hydro - rapidly troubled
unturned, passing near the north star. When first
seen, they were nearly spread, estimated at 3-5° apart.
Then two girls became agitated and claimed "look at
that" as these objects moved closer. At about this
time, the two objects closest to Polaris tended to
converge and then again found a parallel path,
but remained closer together than when rigidly seen.
The two disappeared in the west - the locality of

to next was approx. 5-6 second. There did not
appear to be any sound. They were reddish blue,
white vegetable 2-3 and appeared to have eyes

27 May 1965

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Box 9494
FTD Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

Here are reports on two sightings I recently investigated. One is the old case of 14 November 1964, made by Dr. _____ and two young ladies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This remains an unknown. The facts as stated in his letter of 16 November are completely unchanged. There is always a possibility that these were birds, but we can't find any source of reflected light.

A few points can be added: after all this time, Dr. _____ regards this as having been "a most unusual sight". I had him count off an imaginary re-enactment of the incident and it came more or less in ten (10) seconds. During this time the three objects traveled some 160 degrees. Courses were strictly parallel except that one light moved abruptly closer to the one above it midway, and then continued on a strictly parallel path.

Dr. _____ said it was not a brilliant light, was reddish, "had some size" and did not have the pinpoint scintillation of stars. "If you had not been looking, you would have missed it." The Dr. Martin who was with him never did locate objects. Lights seemed to be emanating from objects, and trailing edge seemed to have a little additional luminosity. He said they were like three dim lights whizzing across the sky. Both the ten-year-old girls saw them also.

I had talked with the girls earlier and ______. One girl said, "like a sandwich plate but smaller than the moon". The other girl said it looked like round balls, "like tennis balls reflecting light, that got smaller and smaller but stayed the same brightness". Observations were made from an alley in back of the house. No lights, other than occasional street lights, no shopping center nearby. The moon was shining.

Dr. _____ definitely thinks they were not birds, but there is still no completely compelling reason to rule this out. There was no sound whatever. It seems to me that birds fifty (50) to one hundred (100) feet above observers could have caused this. Certainly, air craft are ruled out because of high speed.

That's all on this report.
