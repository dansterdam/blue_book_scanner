34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 15 7 67
    Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

[The rest of the text is handwritten and appears to be a detailed description of a sighting, with some words being difficult to fully decipher. The text includes references to objects, their movement, size, and other observations. The handwriting is cursive and somewhat challenging to read completely.]

The text begins with some numerical notation (0 0 0, 1 2 3 4 5) and then continues with a description that seems to discuss an object's characteristics, movement, and the observer's perception of the event.

The text appears to be a supplementary explanation of a UFO sighting, providing additional details not captured in the main questionnaire.

OD's note:
Because Mr Cardell was no longer
at the scene of the lights, I did not
question him extensively (he was calling
long distance non-collect from Toledo), but
asked him to write down his recollections
on paper so that he would be able to
recall the observance clearly in case
of further need of this information from him.

He said he also heard something
on a 3 Montreal (Canada) radio about
a sighting this same date almost exactly
similar to what he saw.

I was driving in a car on the Detroit
Expressway with 4 companions at 0115
when the occupants observed lights in the
sky as described in news of this page.

Here is the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: [blank fields for Day, Month, Year]

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

2 Sept 67, 0115 EST.

Description: "2 lights in the sky, like white headlights. Then a 3rd one to right of the first two, blinking out off. Finally more lights - blinked in units there were 6 lights or in all. Slight downward angle to left. Definite formation.

1/2 mile up in sky. This happened at 1:15 when 4 of us were in a car passing through Detroit on the expressway. There definitely seemed to be a formation of lights (like towers 1/2 mile high) with lights on tops?)

2 lights blinked out off from left to right in sequence."
