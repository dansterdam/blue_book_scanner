This is from all sighting I observed. There also looked and have seen them chang from red to the brilliant white. Seem to maneuver in many ways stop completely and moved so slow we threw at these speed taking several car lengths to stay behind them. Literally we could stop to get a good look then catch up with them. They can make a complete circle O then go straight up and angle at least on speed lets so O on O of straight and go slowly right or left O on O (also have seen later so O and disappear) before eyes so fast it unbelievable. Can and stepping then going in direction of turn while they came - O on, seeing, as many as if making formation or moving in formation

Hector Quintanilla Jr. Maj.
Dear Sir:

In reply to your letter dated Jan 11, 1968. Other witnesses, than myself to observation Nov 14, 1967. were my husband and my daughter Dawn. My husband saw objects on-this way, home. My daughter and I were at home and watched for several hours.

On previous dates I listed names and address of persons other than myself. Most about Jan 23 24 also seen, by two daughters and my husband watched them through out the evening. Using the scope as before. Description and the ability to maneuver and direction and the stop and go. Changing lighting from red and white to luminous in seconds. Always two or more and only several minutes apart going in some direction.

In this world follow the leader.

I do know what I've been watching for over two years are not jets, airliners or helicopters. As all of these go over this area. Objects are to late to be stars, planets or clouds. After following objects one knows there something different.

Dear Sir:

In reply to your letter dated Jan 11, 1968, (other witnesses, then myself to observation Nov 14, 1967) were my husband and may desire to tell. My husband same objects on his way home. My daughter and I were at home and watched for several hours.

On previous dates I listed names and address of persons other than myself.

Just night Jan 23, 24 also seen by two daughters and my husband I watched them throughout the evening. Using the scope as before. Description and the ability to maneuver any direction and stop and go. Changing lighting from red and white to luminous in seconds, always two or more and only several minutes apart going in same direction.

In other words follow the leader.

I do know what we have been watching for two days are not jets, weather or helicopters. As all of these go over this area. Objects are to close to be stars, plants or clouds. After following objects,

Here is the text from the document:

Seeing is believing if my information is of help to you, I would like to know. I'm not anxious but very interested because of what I've seen. If these objects are picked up on radar it's gladly call again - if this information is of no help to you then I've wasted a lot time watching what people call flying saucers.

Approximately a week ago, my daughter and saw a bluish white fireball come straight down to now. The bluish effect was on outer edge and in the tail of the ball. About the size of a basket ball. Not like a shooting star. Didn't seem to burn out. Just coming straight down and disappearing if turning a light switch off. It may have been a large meteor but we never seen anything like it. Delay in answering your letter as I'm closing the books for my husband.

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARS TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
