The observer sighted 2 or 3 objects that "moved about going in no set pattern". She observed them for 5 hours. They did not move. The observer also stated "I've seen them too many times previously..."
Comments: The observers account of the sighting is at points confusing and is often continuing. Although witnesses are listed for this sighting, there addresses were not given.

IF IT APPEARED TO BE A LIGHT, INDICATE WHAT PART OF THE OBJECT, IF ANY, YOU COULD SEE OTHER THAN THE LIGHT ITSELF.

These were bodies in the sky that illuminated at night, they were bodies like clouds but smaller in size and much brighter than clouds. They seemed to have a soft yellow glow and were quite distinct from the moon and stars. They seemed to float slowly at times, move quickly at times and at one point one body approached very close, to within what seemed like 200 yards and was quite bright and clear.

The form includes instructions to "Draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon" and provides space for the witness to describe the observed phenomenon. The witness has written a description, which reads: "Very bright and a bright glow. On Oct. 6, 1967 a red flashing came. There was a intersection light case so bright it appeared fuzzy as if the white fuzzy glow". The form also includes a section for "Angular Size", which has been left blank.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

IS DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL, SUCH AS SIZE, NUMBER OF LIGHTS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or form from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

This information which you feel is pertinent but which is not adequately covered in this questionnaire. 

There was an observation of an object which apparently has some degree of intelligence. This was witnessed by several trained observers and the observation was made in clear weather with good visability. They were able to observe it quite closely for a considerable time and could make out details. The object appeared to be powered and capable of very high speed and maneuver ability. It did not make a sound and was seen to go off in any direction and stop at any time. It was bright as compared to the sky and sharply defined. When it started off, it seemed to accelerate instantly and when it stopped, it did so instantly. There was no evidence of any exhaust or propelling mechanism. 

I feel that this is an important subject worthy of thorough investigation, and I would appreciate any information you can give me relative to it.

Heater Francantine May
Sir, I wanted to relate this little date a visit I had the night of Nov. 8, 1967. I went outside about 9:00 PM and was watching the sky. I soon saw a strange bright object coming from the northwest and it came closer. When it was right over me, it hovered for about 5 minutes and then went straight up and disappeared very fast. It seemed to be 20 to 30 feet in diameter and was giving off a bright white light. I called my husband and my daughter, and they also saw the object. We were all amazed and wondered what it could be. Most light planes have an orange color and make noise, but this object was silent and seemed to be a different color. We waited to see if it would return, but it did not. I am quite sure we saw some kind of flying object that is not explained. I would be most interested to know if anyone else reported seeing the same thing that night. Please let me know if you have any information on this. Thanking you in advance, I am, Sincerely yours, Heater Francantine May

Here is the text I have extracted from the document:

Hector (Guanajuato) Meey
I saw this
On the night of October 9, 1948 between 6:30 and 7:00 PM. At our residence in Haight village, Petersburg, Michigan, my husband and I saw a strange flying object in the sky. It was globular or spherical in shape and looked to be about 30 feet in diameter. It was maneuvering and gliding along silently and swiftly. While watching it, it suddenly seemed to dematerialize from our sight. It was not an airplane, helicopter or any other known aircraft. The object appeared to be under intelligent control and was definitely not a natural phenomenon such as a meteor or planet. Most of the persons in our neighborhood besides myself and my husband were witnesses to this strange occurrence. I did try to get a closer look, but as I approached it, it would seem to move away from me. It was a very strange and unexplainable experience. I do know that I am not the only one who has been watching for or seen this type of UFO in this area. Apparently, others in this region have also been observing similar objects at various times. I would be most interested in any information your organization may have regarding this particular sighting or others that may have been reported in this general area. Please let me know if you require any further details from me.
