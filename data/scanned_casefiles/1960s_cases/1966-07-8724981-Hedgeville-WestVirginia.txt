35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

NW a were on a camping trip that night. We noticed a pulsating object and called Bonnie's attention to it. The object noticed that it was blinking in serie red, yellow, blue green. We began looking and saw about 10 times the seven that I didn't include these (the seven that they were quite far away).

This was at 11:00 P.M. and NW tried to signal one with a flashlight (we waited & try for a contact). After about 10 minutes of signaling we gave up. A little while later we noticed several of these objects moving into a position which seemed to circle us. At about 2:30 A.M. we saw some that all of a sudden they would be standing still. Then would leave a white trail behind them about 20 inches long (in comparison) and then just disappear. From this factor of...

Think that they probably ground the speed of light. (They looked something like meteor except that they would be standing still and they were static up kind of down.) At about 3:38 we decided we were not going to happen so we lay down and watch them take off. At about 3:45 Norris would pointed to the sky and said "Look."

We looked and then coming straight toward us was U.F.O. we were camped on a bluff overlooking small stream. From us to the other bunch was out 3 1/2 and the bluff was about 40 ft. high. Light came toward us it leveled off about 15 ft. higher than we laying down) and on the other side on the stream and started circling around us. It was about halfway around the object started to come down to. They came within about 100 yards and then started to their original position. Meanwhile the first continued to circle until we lost sight of it. Then I decide we could have made contact that night if we had thought of calling or trying anyway to let them know where we were. After that we went to bed about 2 miles past a bluff to a high tension power line.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
no.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what
it moved behind: a group of trees in behind us

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what
in front of: a group of trees in front of us

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: none
b. Color: white yellow like a worm or copper
with a light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match? not sure but it would not have more covered very much probably about an inch of it. 0 altitude 30 was about 300 ft. diameter.

The sketch includes notes like:
- "Blue lights on other side now"
- "Green light"
- "Yellow light"
- "direction of travel"
- "direction of belt movement"
- "The lights were on a type of belt"

UFO Hovers
In Sky Here
Last Night

Large Object, Close
To Hilltop, Viewed
Over Half-Hour

Last night a huge circular object
with a bright white light — and
flashing red lights — hovered over
Greendale Road east of Kane for more than a half
hour before streaking away at an
incredible speed. This has been verified by five persons who watched
the object from the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Kane residents were attracted by
the light—blinking they saw a meteor.

Last night at 9:45 o'clock, three
Kane young men, Robert Holland,
Pat Scutella and Harold (Corky)
Haight, were driving a Jeep on the
road connecting Route 321 with the
Greendale Road via the "Water
works."

This is their story:
They saw a bright light ahead as
they drove onto the Greendale
Road. They turned off the head
lights and motor to note a large
round object "close to the ground,"
hovering in a fixed position. They
watched it several minutes—noting
the object was about 50 feet across
the edge. The object began moving,
almost an undulating movement,
rising and lowering—soundless.

Not trusting their own eyes, they
drove to the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Ron Peterson on the old Smethport Road where the Peterson family came out and watched the object. The Peterson children also
watched the object — and were
frightened.

They observed the "bright light"
of the object for some minutes.
There were sounds of a jet plane
which had been rising and lowering slowly, became "jerky in movement"
and suddenly flashed away with
with meteor-like speed "toward the
moon."

The young men came into Kane
sub-station of State Police to report their experience to Sgt. John
Dussia and Corporal Murray. A description was drawn—agreed by all
observers. Sgt. Dussia said it matched previous UFO reports.

Authorities are convinced the
youths saw "something."

A check with Greendale Road
residents revealed that two residents saw an unusual red light in
the sky three weeks ago.

As the residents of Kane and
others who have seen the objects
will report their sightings.

But, as they all agreed, "We
could hardly believe our eyes—and
how can we expect others to believe what we saw ourselves." We do not

Dear [redacted]

This will reply to your letter of June 7th reporting your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date, it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that a witness report his observation as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force installation. This enables Air Force analysis to perform a comprehensive investigation.

What you saw was obviously unfamiliar to you. We define a UFO as an aerial phenomenon or object which is unknown or appears out of the ordinary to the observer.

A copy of the report on Project Blue Book is enclosed. I am certain it will be useful to you.

Sincerely,

BARNETT B. YOUNG, Lt Col, USAF

Dear [redacted],

This will reply to your letter of June 7, regarding your understanding of a report (UFO) sighting.

We appreciate, heartily, your interest in expressing and with this letter for information purposes, at this late date, it would be impractical to make a detailed more glow. It is important that a witness report has observation as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force installation. This enables his later detailed analysis & perform a comprehensive investigation.

We understand was obviously conformable to your. We define a UFO as an aerial phenomenon or object which to layman or appears out of the ordinary to the observer.

Thank you for your
Project Blue Book copy of the report on and certain it will be useful to you.

Sincerely,

Dear Sirs,                                                     June 7
                                                                        (1962)

My name is [redacted] + I am seventeen yrs. old and I would like to tell you about my experience with three U.F.O's. Last July 26, 1966 I went out to call my brother to come eat supper, when I looked up in the sky toward the lake, I always had a habit looking up at the sky to see what kind of a day it's going to be when I saw three objects that looked oval shaped + was very shiny like a quarter in the sun. Well I noticed they had no wings + no tail + they moved up + down + across like they were playing jump the frog. Well I was fascinated by them so I thought they were helicopters but I realized they had no sound + went out of formation like a square is shaped. It was about 3 p.m. + the sky was clear they were 100 ft. from me + were up about 1 mile. Then 2 wks. later I saw a green light coming toward me + I thought at was a lightning bug but well


- page 25 -

I got scared because it was a big sound ball that kept bounding up & down moving from side to side & went around me & went up straight into the sky. My girlfriend H.P. & I saw it together. Well I would like you to find out if I have some kind of thing with these. I mean why should I see them - other people cannot's. Why am I fortunate to see them. I want to get in contact with M--- from another galaxy - but I try - nothing happens I think real hard but I can't get contact with him. Oh well I hope didn't take up all your time so I'll go now.

P.s. write
Back
Soon

P.S. I believe in U.F.O's & I'm a very religious person.

July 30, 1966
Tyler, Texas, 75701

Sir -
Over some 50 yrs. I've observed the moon with awe, admiration. My typical are X3, made in Japan some 40 yrs. ago. (I took the 1st. small eye piece, put it face down on the large left eye piece and secured it with tape) and this is some of my views. What am I seeing? Reflection of my own eye sight? No.

My point of focus is the moon. By far am seeing my own eye pupil then it is indeed a remarkable discovery to me; and would call for more writing then I care to do at this time.

I can name a few things, I am not an astronomer, an artist or neurotic and I have this in print.

Now for my letter, I begin to view the moon about 7:15 p.m. I & marvel at it being bright so early in the p.m.

No. 1 & 2 there viewed near 10 p.m. at the same time = no reflection, and because I saw to it, there was none. By another

The big black spot was near 4° of the moon's area. No. 3. The moon dimmed out, spinned, to barely visible, then returned to No. 4, to something, similar to our space or sired metal, if glistened) but not to glow. It returned to a state similar to No. 3 again, & returning to No. 5, with about a 4° of it missing. No. 6, 7, 8, 9 & 10 are new at other hrs. on the 27th 28th and 29th. No. 11 is my view of a glow ball "& could be a tornado eye".

No. 12, A full moon, with valcano or water spout action being struck by nimbus. Cumulus clouds, 3d, 5, 1966.

I have noted we heard of the moon having any other change other than by monthly that we were acquainted with. God & believe if is true that we have been missing over many centuries.

an object like a 2 mag. star went east, about 70°. & in the south east, and seemly some 25 to 28,000 ft. alt., more of a "float-mg" action, than a sail. No signals flashed.

You know my notes mailed Aug. 12th, and I have a number more, in fact, too many to attempt to describe in a letter. If you have an address in Tyler that I might mail, and tell my findings to, it would be very enlightening with ways like those found in Tyler some 5-7 yrs. just a plain old human being with good intentions, I will assure you.

Dear S.J.,

On Sunday July 31st '66 at 1:30 am at a point in Northern Ontario (latitude 46°02'; longitude 80°49') an object was spotted traversing the sky from south to north at approximately satellite speed (i.e. an angle of about 30° was traversed in approximately 5 minutes).

It was observed to be generally heading towards the North Star (Polaris) when it appeared to slow down and subsequently change course to a due east. The slowing down phenomena was clearly a result of the curvature in the flight path as the object was changing course. After changing course, the object was visible for only about 1 to 2 minutes.

Because of the altitude or smallness of the object, no details were observed of its structure or shape, even though it was observed through binocular. The sky was exceptionally clear that evening and as a result, many stars were visible. No trail was observed on this object and no audible sound could be detected. It possessed brightness of the same intensity as an Echo satellite for example, or a very close star. The brightness did not vary and no

I appreciate the fact that the object may have been a very high altitude aircraft, although the speed with which it traversed the sky was the absence of any sound leads me to suspect otherwise. Be that as it may, I (comparing and myself) might possibly be of interest to you. June, you have access to the flight paths of balloons, aircraft, satellites etc I felt perhaps you might then ask an explanation to us. If I can be of further assistance to you regarding this matter, I shall be happy to do so.

Sincerely,

I appreciate the fact that the object may have been a very high altitude the aircraft, although the speed with which it traversed the sky and the absence of any sound leads suspect otherwise. Be that as it may, I felt that this observation (made by my three adult companions and myself) might possibly be of interest to you. Since you have access to flight paths and satellite capability, you might be able to perhaps give me an explanation to us. If I can be of further assistance to you regarding this matter, I shall be happy to do so.

Dear Sir,

On Sunday July 31st '66 at 1:30 am at a point in Northern Ontario (latitude 46° 02', longitude 80° 49') an object was spotted traversing the sky from south to north at approximately satellite speed (1c; an angle of about 30° was traversed in approximately 5 minutes). It was observed to be generally heading towards the North Star (Polaris) when it appeared to slow down and subsequently change course to a due east. The slowing down phenomena was clearly a result of the curvature in the flight path as the object was changing course. After changing course, the object was visible for only about 1 to 2 minutes.

Because of the altitude or smallness of the object, no details were observed of its structure or shape, even through it was observed through binoculars. The sky was exceptionally clear that evening and as a result, many stars were visible. No trail was discerned in this object and no audible sound could be detected. It possessed brightness of the same intensity as an Echo satellite for example, or a very close star. The brightness did not vary and no

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Dear

Reference your unidentified flying object report of 31 July 1966. The only indication of azimuth and elevation of the alleged UFO was given as just above the morning star. Assuming Venus to be the morning star, the planet was rising on an azimuth of 75° degrees and at 0400 EST was at an elevation of 18 degrees.

Request you complete the enclosed FTD Form 134 and enclose a sketch of the alleged UFO in relation to the morning star.

Your cooperation is appreciated.
