OD-19-2957 66
Line 295-125

The report describes an incident in Hedgeville, West Virginia where a witness reported seeing an unusual object in the sky. The witness described the object as a "white, round sphere" that was "hovering around very erratic" and "appeared to be burning or glowing."

The report further states that the witness called the police and other local authorities to report the sighting. The authorities reportedly investigated the incident but did not find any physical evidence or explanation for the observed object.

- page 8 -

This document does not contain any photographs. However, the text appears to be a report from the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text reads:

REPORT OF THE OD 19-20 Jul 66
Phone call of 19 Jul 66 from Montgomery County, West Virginia reported that his father received a call from an Operation Sky Trace member in Topeka, Kansas to alert him that an object - described as "blinking lights" was sighted in the direction of Texas and was traveling in the direction toward Ohio.
He stated he was told blinking lights were observed at 2120 (Dayton time) in the area of Topeka, Kansas. He did not know who called his father, but gave the following for possible contact in Topeka.
He stated that he heard that the same type of objects had been sighted from the area of West Virginia which were flying in the direction of Ohio. He stated he wanted to report these objects so the Air Force could go up and catch them.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 14 February 1962

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

We noticed a strange form that might be an object that was lighted in a dull yellow of salmon and very bright at times. It was blinking on and off and then it would blot out the stars as it passed across the sky. It also seemed to be moving at an unusually high rate of speed. We are certain that it was not a plane, as it was much lower down and was not making any sound. We continued watching it for about 10 minutes, at the end of which time, it seemed to have gone out and disappeared into the night sky. We noticed that it was quite a size, about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. It was a very peculiar object and we would like any information as to what it could have been. After about 10 minutes, it seemed to grow dimmer and dimmer until we could no longer see it.

Around 7:15 a.m. a couple observed an object hovering above the ground. The object was hovering and darting about. It would move a short distance, stop and hover, and then move again. The object was watched for around 2:30 as it continued to dart around. It was orange in color and about 6 feet in diameter. It would dart down to within 30 feet of the ground and watch them. Then it would dart up to 1,000 feet. It would emit a slight humming sound as it moved. The observers felt they were being observed by the object. As it approached them, they felt some sense of fear and it then darted away to about 1/2 mile. It would repeat this cycle for around 30 minutes until it finally climbed rapidly out of sight. This was an extremely unusual and unexplained sighting. The observers felt the object was intelligently controlled and under some type of exterior guidance.

UFO HOVERS IN SKY HERE LAST NIGHT
Large Object Close To Earth - Hovered Motionless For Several Hours
Greendale, W. Va., July 7 - Several young men, including Robert Holland, Ed Perine, and Hogan, reported last night at about 12:30 a.m. they had seen a large object hovering motionless over the Greendale Road via the "Water Works." 
The object is said to have hovered for several hours at a fixed position. It was described as large, circular in shape, and giving off a bright light. It was observed through binoculars. The object made no sound and suddenly flashed away with fantastic speed.
Sgt. Peterson an old-timer on the Greendale Police Force, and Paulene, a resident, also observed the object and were reported to be "amazed" at its appearance. 
There were sounds of a jet plane approaching the area which may have caused the object to suddenly flash away.
The Greendale Police said they would continue to investigate the report and would question all possible witnesses. Sgt. Puccia said it matched previous UFO reports. However, no official confirmation was made.

No case info only

July 30 1966
Hedgeville, West Virginia

This case warrants in my opinion who reported what happened. As indicated, the report indicates a humanoid appeared, about 3 1/2 feet tall. The witness claims to have seen this entity with his own eyes at close range. He was about 30-40 years old, with wavy hair and a reddish face. The entity made a humming noise and the witness became afraid, so he lowered his head. When he looked up again, the entity was gone. The witness claims he has never seen anything like this before. He is not an astronomer, nor an expert on unusual or UFO phenomena. However, he is very impressed by what he witnessed and wanted it reported. I suggest we assign this case a thorough investigation, as there seems to be no indication of hoax or misidentification. The witness appears to be sincere in his report. A more detailed interview may provide additional information. No photographs were taken.

plane, it is about the size of a small to medi- um sized plane. My wife awakened me around 3:30 in the morning and called my attention to a strange aerial object in the sky. This was around 4 am July 29 1966. The object was round in shape and about the size of a small plane. It had steady white light shining thru it. It seemed to glow and give off a white light and moved up and down slowly and at an angle. The object was visible for about 15 minutes and then disappeared. It made no noise and was about a mile high, very clear and bright. It seemed to float and then disappear into the darkness. My wife and I both watched it for the entire time it was visible.

Case No. 1966-07-8724981
Date of Incident: July 8, 1966
Time of Incident: 12:30 AM

On July 8, 1966, at approximately 12:30 AM, Mrs. Sarah Smith, residing at 356 Maple Street, Hedgeville, West Virginia, reported sighting an unidentified flying object over her home.

According to Mrs. Smith's statement, she was awakened by a bright light shining through her bedroom window. Upon looking outside, she observed a large, cigar-shaped object hovering silently approximately 500 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and emitted a soft, pulsing glow.

Mrs. Smith further stated that the object remained in the area for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from sight at a high rate of speed. She immediately contacted the local authorities to report the incident.

Investigation into this case is ongoing. No definitive conclusions have been reached at this time.

Dear Sir,

On Sunday July 31st '66 at 1:20 a.m. at a point in Northern Ontario ( latitude 46 0 or; longitude 80 0 ??) an object was observed at approximately satellite speed (15 miles per minute) to north at an altitude of approximately 30 0 was traversed in approximately 5 minutes. The object was observed to be cylindrical in shape (or conical), brownish in color, and sub-sequentially change course to a heading approximately due east. 
Its luminosity appeared to slow down and subsequently change course to an easterly direction. The object was under observation for about one minute.
Because of the attitude or smallness of the object, no details were observed of its structure or shape. The observation was exceptionally clear, that evening and a number of stars were visible. 
The object was not obscured by clouds and it was moving at very high speed.

I appreciate the fact that the object may have been a very high altitude, the aircraft, although the radar measurements increased the sky and the absence of any ground obstacles would indicate that this observation ( made by three scientists and myself) must possibly be of interest to you. Since data satellites are of interest and the air space explication techniques developed by this means might be of a nature as to warrant our attention, I should be interested to discuss the matter further directly and to do so.

I appreciate the fact that the object may have been a very high altitude aircraft, although the speed with which it travelled and the absence of any sound would indicate that it probably was not. I would be interested to hear if you have any further explanations to offer, which might lead to a better understanding of this observation. I hope that I can be of some assistance in this matter.

Dear Sir,

On Sunday July 31st /66 at 1:30 a.m. at a point in southwestern Ontario (longitude approx 80 - 20') an object was sighted travelling from South to North at approximately incredible speed (13 an angle of approximately 5 minutes) for approximately 30 seconds and disappeared towards the North. The object appeared to be metallic and change of shape rapidly. North star (Polaris) when eye approached to slow down and disappear completely. Brightness was observed to have a reddish tinge. The size of the object was tiny compared to the full moon as observed under the same conditions. The trajectory of the object was along the bright path as the object was observed to follow a seemingly straight course. The brightness diminished to a starlike lustre in the order of magnitude of one-half to a minute. Atmospheric clarity was exceptionally clear that evening, and no audible sound was associated with the observed object. The object possessed no distinguishing features or tail lights. The brightness did not vary and no colored lights were detected.
