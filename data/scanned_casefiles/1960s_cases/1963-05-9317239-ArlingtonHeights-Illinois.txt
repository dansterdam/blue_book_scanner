Here is the text I can read from the document:

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL

The UFO sighting over Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, was reported by Central Aviation, the witness, located at Arlington Heights, Illinois. The report was made to BLUE BOOK on 17 May 1963.

The object changed in shape, according to the witness, Clara, the object appeared in a silver-white color. Later changes to a pearly-white appearance. The Naval Air Station confirmed that others had seen the object. O'Hara Air Defense Command interceptor was scrambled to investigate.

At first moved a little, but then completely stationary. The Chicago Tribune was notified, but the story was not printed. The object was solid material wide. The German has been referenced in the relations.

A balloon would have drifted for wind and could be explained by air officials. Neither was it an airplane. Favorable for these reasons. Until further proof arrives, the last consideration was the temperature in the area.

What was it?

Note: Some parts of the text are slightly illegible or cut off at the edges, so I have transcribed what I could clearly read.
