The text in the document is as follows:

THIS AIRMAN WAS VERY VAGUE ON MANY DETAILSCONCERNING THIS SIGHTING. 
HIS ESTIMATION OF THE SIZE AND DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT AND 
THE DISTANCE IT WAS FROM HIM. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE C-45S FROM 
WHITEMAN AFB TO TINKER AFB, TAKING OFF AT 2241, COULD HAVE BEEN 
WHAT HE OBS_RVED. HERE WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT NEAR THE SIGHTING WHICH 
MAY HAVE REFLECTED OFF HIS AIRCRAFT. A2C _____ WAS ABOUT SEVEN 
MILES FROM THE BASE AT THE TIME OF HIS SIGHTING. TO THE BEST OF 
MY KNOWLEDGE, A2C _____ WAS THE ONLY PERSON OBSERVE THIS UFO.
