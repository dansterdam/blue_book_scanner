was in back of them. They say the object was moving from north to south, yet their diagram shows the object moving from south to east. The fact that the object had the same color as the moon, and seemed to travel around the moon, leaves me to think that as they were traveling (60 miles per hour) they may have come to a turn in the road, changing the angle of the windshield to the moon, causing a traveling reflection to be seen. Obviously, I cannot prove this, but in view of the tremendous number of inconsistencies in the report, the youth of the two observers, the fact that the other four in the car did not see it, and the short duration of the sighting leads me to this conclusion. However, I think insufficient and conflicting data would be best.

Not in my current file. Apparently misplaced. Will do in Dayton.

Even though this has five witnesses, the report contains insufficient information for a meaningful evaluation. Weak or data is missing, and witnesses were adolescents. Case could be classified as possible aircraft, or possible balloon, or possible unknown.

30. 29 June 1967, Scotts Plain, New Jersey.
Several attempts to get in touch with the original witnesses have proved futile. The man, truck driver, has not telephone listed, and I received no response to letters sent to him. He may be an itinerant and not traceable. His passenger, Mrs. Shirley Winn, also was not traceable. No phone listed and letter to address listed was returned.

Yet despite this, original report stated that there were many corroborating witnesses. Apparently the Air Force interrogator didn't locate any of these, or give any leads as to how they might be located.

The report has a strangeness of Â¼, but relatively low reliability. Also there is an inconsistency. The report states that the object appeared at one time about 100 feet from the observer and at another time the object was circling an aircraft. No time-motion sequence established. I would recommend that in view of the fact that it was impossible to get any additional information, the case be carried as insufficient information, possible unknown. Yet the original report was so bizarre and so suggestive of something strange that there should have been immediate and comprehensive follow-up.

Creston, Iowa 50801
January 27, 1967

Sirs:

I would like to report a sighting of a strange object. It was sighted on the night of April 26, 1967. It was first seen at about east-northeast with an angle of elevation of about 45 degrees. When first spotted it was but a dim red light. Suddenly it became a bright amber color, about 4 or 5 times brighter than a star. At the first magnitude. It remained the amber color for about one and a half minutes. Then it dimmed to the red color for about 2 minutes. Again it turned to the amber color for about one and minutes. Again it grew dim.

I remained in this condition for about one minute and started to blink a 6 volt flashlight toward the object and started to think. Immediately after I started blinking the light it started traveling straight west, in a zig-zag pattern. As it passed by it emitted a sound resembling a lot. I estimated it was traveling between 300 and 400 miles per hour at an altitude of about 14,000 feet. The object disappeared, along with the sound at an angle of elevation of about 20 degrees, west-northwest. The object was too high to make out any definite shape. When in the air condition a red light appeared, side by side. It was first sighted at about 8:00 PM.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
While moving in orbit. While not.
[A simple sketch with an arrow is present]

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
