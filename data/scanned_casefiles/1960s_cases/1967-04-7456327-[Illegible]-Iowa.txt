was in back of them. They say the object was moving from north to south, yet their diagram shows the object moving from south to east. The fact they did the object had turned could have caused the discrepancy, and appeared to them that it was turning, and moved around traveling (60 miles per hour) they may have come to a halt in the road, changing the angle of the windshield, which the moving object caused a traveling reflection to be seen. Obviously, I cannot prove this, but it is a view of the tremendous uncertainties in the report.

The report, the youth of the observers, the two observers, the duration of the sightings is all very carefully estimated. I believe, unless additional corroborating confirmation is established, this case constitutes insufficient and conflicting data would be best.

28. 25 April 1967, Port Chester, New York.
Not in my current file. Apparently misplaced. Will do in Dayton.

29. 26 April 1967, Preston, Iowa.
Even though this has five witnesses, the report contains insufficient information, the description of the object is missing, and witnesses were adolescents. Case could be classified as possible aircraft, or possible unmanned.

30. 29 June 1967, Scotts Plain, New Jersey.
Several attempts to get in touch with the original witnesses have proved futile. The chief driver, has not telephone listed, and I received no response to letters sent to him. He may be an itinerant and not traceable. His passenger, Mrs. Shirley Winn, also was not traceable. No phone listed and letter so addressed was returned.

Yet despite this, original report stated that there were many corroborating witnesses. Apparently the Air Force interrogator didn't locate any of these, or give any leads as to how they might be located.

The report has a strangeness of 2âœ¶, but relatively low reliability. Also the object disappeared, the report indicates that the object appeared at one time about 100 feet from the observer and at another time the object was circling an aircraft. No time-motion sequence established. I would recommend that in view of the fact that it was impossible to get any additional information, the case be carried as insufficient information, possible unknown. Yet the original report was so bizarre and no suggestive of something strange that there should have been immediate and comprehensive follow-up.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Sirs:
I would like to report a sighting of a strange object. It was sighted on the night of April 26, 1967 at about 9:30 P.M. It was [illegible] about 30 degrees above the horizon. When first sighted it appeared to be a light, but upon closer observation it seemed to be a definite object, larger than a bright planet or star. It remained the same size and color, a sort of amber or reddish color, for about 3 minutes. Again it turned to the amber color. It seemed to grow in size until it was about 20 degrees across. The object then seemed to diminish in size until it was just a star or planet again. It then disappeared. My landlord, a 76 year old man, witnessed the same sight. It appeared to be traveling towards the south and started and stopped, seeming to hover. I am a minister and a reliable person. I would appreciate your investigation of this matter. I am available for further information if desired.
Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

The image does not contain any photograph, but rather a diagram and an empty space for a drawing. The diagram shows a compass and a sketch depicting the elevation and direction of an observed object relative to the horizon.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
