DEAR SIRS:

PLEASE COULD YOU SEND ME ANY INFORMATION
BOOKLETS, PICTURES OR ARTICLES CONCERNING
UFO'S. I AM USING ALL AND ANY I
CAN GET ON A SCIENCE FAIR FOR
SCHOOL. I'M VERY INTERESTED BECAUSE
I'VE SEEN A FLYING SAUCER ON SEPT. 5TH
AT 9:00 PM. IT HAD RED AND WHITE
LIGHTS THAT SEEMED TO REVOLVE
AROUND IT. I CALLED THE AIR PORT
AND THERE WASN'T ANY PLANES OR
HELICOPTERS OVER THE AREA ONE
HOUR BEFORE OR AFTER THE TIME
I SAW IT ALONG WITH MY FATHER
AND GIRLFRIEND. I WILL APPRECIATE
ANYTHING I CAN GET. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

SINCERELY,

P.S.
I AM 14 YEARS OLD
