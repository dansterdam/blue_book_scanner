The text in the document is as follows:

1. This replies to your letter concerning your observation of an unidentified  
object on 5 September 1967.

2. While reviewing our correspondence files we found your letter in  
which you reported sighting an unidentified object on 5 September 1967.  
Because of an error, your sighting was not investigated immediately. As  
indicated, your letter stated that you witnessed a silvery, disc-shaped  
object at approximately 4:00 PM. We regret the delay in investigating  
this as it has kept us from investigating your observation. However, if you  
would complete the enclosed AF Form 117 we will investigate your sighting in an attempt to determine the cause for your observation.

3. As usual, please excuse us for not responding to your correspondence earlier.

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF  
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office  
Aerospace Technologies Division  
Directorate of Development
