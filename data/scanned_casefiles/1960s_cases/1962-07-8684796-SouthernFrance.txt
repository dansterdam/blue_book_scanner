Gentlemen:

Would you be so kind as to tell me what object was seen in space over the Lower Pyrenees in southern France moving from west to east on 19 July 1952 at about 2130 hours European time. This object was moving rapidly and looked like a star. I could see it for about 30 minutes.

Thank you very much for the information concerning the object.

Respectfully yours,
