SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
Aerospace Technologists Division
Production Directorate

1. My apologies for the delay in replying to your request during our telephone conversation in April. Major Vanoverhovven has been on leave. I was finally able to contact him on leave, I received this account of the incident in question.

2. While he was on a mission during the evening of 3 November 1967, he noted a fast-moving return on the radar scope. Somewhat later, five more returns were sighted on the radar. The five returns were grouped within a five mile radius and were moving at a high rate of speed. They were present on the radar scope for approximately two to three minutes. The objects were never sighted visually or otherwise identified.

3. Major Vanoverhovven mentioned the sightings to Chicago Center but did not report the sightings to Offutt Air Force Base. A copy of this brief report by Chicago Center finally arrived in my office early this year. At that time, however, Major Vanoverhovven was not available to comment.

4. I realize that this report is very sketchily. Unfortunately, it is the only information that Major Vanoverhovven could provide. Since the same information was reflected in the report from Chicago Center, I am afraid that this present statement will not be of much assistance to you.

MEMORANDUM

To:   E. U. Condon
From: R. Craig                                   Date: 21 February 1968
Subject: Comment on Air Base Cooperation with
         the CU-UFO Project

1.   On 8 November 1967, a military pilot, while airborne, reported, to the Chicago Center, visual observation of an unknown object and radar tracking of six other unknowns. The single object, which was observed for two to four minutes, was a fast-moving large ball, changing color from red to yellow to white. The report indicated that six more objects were tracked by radar within a range of one and a half to five miles. The Chicago Center stated that the visual UFO also was sighted from two inbound TWA aircraft, but no details of this observation were available.

2.   No report of this sighting was sent to the CU Project. Project personnel learned of it in mid-December during telecon with the Offutt Air Base UFO Officer, who mistakenly assumed that questions pertaining to a different UFO report pertained to the 8 November event, and indicated he had no information beyond initial brief report from the Chicago Center, and to Offutt because the pilot was based there. The officer, Capt. Roy Cunningham, did agree to contact the pilot and send CU whatever information about the event he could get from an interview with pilot "Vanevenoven".

3.   Since the report seemed a particularly interesting one, project personnel sought additional information from the Chicago Center. Telecon with Chicago Center confirmed that the report had been made by both the military pilot and a TWA pilot and crew. Tapes of conversations with the pilots, made during the observations, had, by December 19, been destroyed.

4.   Telecon 16 December with Major Nichols, Chanute AFB, revealed that, since the sighting was 70 miles from Omaha, all information was shipped to Base Operations at Offutt AFB.

5.   Since no information had yet been received from Capt. Cunningham of Offutt AFB, he was again contacted by telephone on 4 January 1968. He indicated he had not had a chance to interview pilot Vanevenoven because Vanevenoven and his crew had taken Christmas vacation as leave. Although now reached him, and would do so very soon. He said he would get a report of the UFO incident to us shortly.

E. U. Condon                     -2-                   21 February 1968

No report had been received by 31 January 1968. According to further phone conversation w/:h Capt. Cunningham, pilot Vandevonver had gone on temporary duty and only now would be available for interview. Cunningham agreed to give priority to interviewing Vandevonver, getting a report to the Colorado Project within a few days. He agreed also to send immediately a copy of the initial UFO sighting report which Offutt received through Chicago Center. The letter was done, and a copy is attached.

As of this date (21 February 1968) no report of the UFO incident of 8 November 1967 has yet been received by the Colorado Project from Offutt AFB or other source.

In UFO report investigated by Capt. Arrington, Chanute AFB. During 10 December telecon with Major Quintanilla of Project Blue Book, regarding the above incident, it was learned that a Capt. Arrington, of Chanute AFB, had investigated a report from ground observers who watched strange moving lights for ten minutes on 18 November 1967, and took a photograph of the lights with a "swinger" camera. Major Quintanilla said Capt. Arrington had arranged a personal meeting with him at Wright-Patterson, scheduled for the next day, to transmit information regarding this sighting to Project Blue Book.

Although the early information did not indicate that this was a particularly strange or interesting UFO report, inquiry was made about it during the above-mentioned telecon with Chanute AFB. It was agreed that Capt. Arrington would send copies of the picture and a complete report of the UFO sighting to the Colorado Project.

No such information had been received by 31 January 1968. Return call to Chanute AFB on that date revealed that Capt. Arrington had cleared the base that day for other assignment, and would not be returning. A call to Major Quintanilla revealed that Capt. Arrington's earlier plans to visit him had been cancelled, and Major Quintanilla was still anticipating the book's receipt of Capt. Arrington's report. Major Quintanilla was concerned that the report had not been received, and indicated he would attempt to locate Capt. Arrington and get the report. When contacted again 21 February 1968, Major Quintanilla indicated that Major Nichols, who had been Capt. Arrington's superior officer at Chanute AFB, had told Major Quintanilla on 31 January that he would contact Capt. Arrington, whose report had been awaiting final typing, and get the report to Blue Book. As of 21 February, neither Blue Book nor Colorado Project had received information from Chanute AFB regarding the 18 November 1967 UFO report.
