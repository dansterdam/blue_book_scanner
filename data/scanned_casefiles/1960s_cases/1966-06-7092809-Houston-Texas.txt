11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers reported seeing, round object with various colors that were changing colors. At 200 yards it looked like the screen of a 21" T.V. set. The white lights were on most of the time whilst the red, blue, and green ones twinkled. The white ones blinked once and a white light like the blinker on a tail light.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched three different lights travel across the sky. One white light traveled 350, another white light traveled toward the SE, and the third red light traveled toward the SW. The first two objects were compared to that of the stars, while the third was just a red color.

The red light moved fast across the sky, with the first two white lights just disappeared from view. In sight. One of the white lights moved behind a small cloud.

The description of the first two lights is consistent with that of a satellite observation, items I and II were are and quite visible but one hour earlier. The description of the third object is not consistent with that of an aircraft sighting.
