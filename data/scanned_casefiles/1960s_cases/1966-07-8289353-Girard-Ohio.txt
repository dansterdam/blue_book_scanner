PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 7 July 66   7/0502E
2. LOCATION: Girard, Ohio

3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 seconds

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: NE

8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Other (psychological)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer noted dark mass in front of exhaust. Object had indefinite shape. Exhaust light still completely for 5 seconds. After the exhaust light disappeared the dark mass was still visible. Exhaust light came on again at a considerable distance further toward the northeast. Object disappeared behind some trees. There was no sound of any type noted.

Personal interview with witness revealed he had some type of ESP. He felt that the men in the craft were trying to communicate with him. He felt that the craft was not from outer-space but a result of ingenious Russian design.

Observer stated he had this form of ESP and could feel persons thinking about him from a distance. He definitely believed that the men in the craft were observing him. This was what caused them to cut off the exhaust for the brief period.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

There was no noticeable wind to-early the sound away when the U.F.O. was sighted.

I was wearing a white shirt and standing in the light of a street light which was approx. soft. away. As I stood straight ahead and directly upward at the U.F.O. in the center, sky, the exhaust light went off completely for approx. 5 seconds and then came back on fully approx. 3 seconds before a high tree ended the sighting. Could it be that the observer me watching that craft? close it possible that the shut off the exhaust light periodically or that any ground observers would lose track of their craft?

Could it be that the light from our steel mills (Struthers to Warren, approx. 20 miles) drawn turn to this area?

When I saw this alien craft moving as far so slow and so close across the center, sky, it had a weird reaction of my body and mind. It was as though the center of the future had been drawn with and with the time being out some 20 miles which (hanging of the missile system) focused with scientific equipment, possible to open way quicker...

Dear Major Quintanilla,

I have given this questionnaire considerable time, thought and study to make it as accurate and complete as humanly possible. I have great it as though it were an examination on which I wished to score a high grade.

I am very much interested and I can firmly convinced that I observed a U.F.O. on July 7th. The exhaust was broader and different than any exhaust that I have ever seen including jets and our Nichols used at Cape Kennedy, although the exhaust stream of the rockets, as they pass the pads at Cape Kennedy would be far longer than what I saw.

In Yillee, Ohio (Cuyahoga Smiles from my residence) reported, sighting several U.F.O.'s through binoculars, at about 5 A.M., one morning during the first week of the month. I talked with him and from his description of them and the way in which they flew, I believe that they were U.F.O.'s.

I gave him your address to send in a report.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]

Dear Sir!

I would like to make a report on some U.F.O. observations which may be of interest to you.

I am a high school language teacher with considerable scientific interest and industrial activity.

I have excellent vision and hearing and have never been subject to hallucinations.

As an infantry veteran in World War II, I observed many forceful and awe inspiring sights, so I am not easily impressed or frightened.

I have followed scientific progress in the space age in magazines and newspapers.

I have observed facing westward, day and night, the single engine biplane, monoplane, helicopter, gliding, propeller and jet, fighters and bombers and the new passenger jets.

I have observed the "Echo" balloons traveling high overhead and watched for T.V. the astronauts go up at Cape Kennedy.

I have flown night & midday on passenger planes.

Since reading that U.F.O.'s have been sighted in various sections of the U.S., I keep scanning the sky in all directions whenever I go outside, late at night.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

to water some newly planted shrubs.

My first observation of a U.F.O. was on July 7th,
at 1AM. in the morning.

On this night, visibility was excellent. The
sky was full of stars and the moon about 3/4ths full
was about 15° above the horizon in the east.

As I stood in my front yard, looking toward
the east, I became aware of a light approaching
from the southwest, at the periphery of my vision.
(ie. it became silhouetted against the dark
eastern sky.) I had a better view. It was approx.
45° above the horizon. The exhaust was a white, fan
shape with a dark streak running through the center.
The exhaust was so large that it would have
taken one-half a dollar bill held at arm's length
to have completely covered it. It seemed to be
more broad than long.

I could not make out the exact shape of the
dark body of the craft which instead blocking out
the stars as it passed. There were no lights
visible in the dark body of the craft.
It was traveling at approx. the speed of a jet
plane but there was no sound whatever at any time.
The exhaust light turned completely off, for a second or so,
and then came back on, at a considerable distance further
along in the eastern sky. There was nothing to block the view.


- page 10 -

I would say that it was at an altitude of approx 1000 ft. and about 1 mile distant. It came from the southwest and went northeast.

I admit that I was awestruck for a few minutes at the audacity of this alien craft flying so low in the heartland of America. I had some fearful, creepy feeling of being observed, came back again - that I'd held in the German spotter planes were circling slowly overhead observing the ground during World War II.

At 12:15 A.M., in the morning, Aug. 6th, I believe that I may have observed another U.F.O.

I was in the back yard watering shrubs, and had stopped, and was looking directly overhead at the stars in the center or zenith of the sky to see if I could discover anything moving. All in one instant, this thing flashed directly overhead. Light into my field of vision, I had not noticed its approach.

The exhaust was a long cylindrical shape, it would have been 12 inch diameter, with a width of 1½ inches deep (held at arm's length). To have completely covered the exhaust. The exhaust was a dark red with a brownish tinge. There were streaks of white running through the red similar in color to the white of a candle's flame.

Conversation of [redacted] on 29 August 1966 on interview with
Major H. Quintanilla, Jr and 1st Lt. William F. Marley.

Since I didn't have instruments my first opinion of the size of ½ the size
of a one dollar bill is in error. Later in comparing it in my mind I dis-
covered my mistake. On Friday the moon wasat the same height and I found
that the size should have been a penny. Exhaust was a little larger than
the moon. Object passed right over the moon and was a little larger than the
moon on 7 July. I have some basic scientific background. Now to get to the
description:

Body size - 2 dimes held at arm's length - 75% accuracy
Using an object to cover object I would use two dimes. I figure this with
75% accuracy. Moon was 3/4 full, 15 degrees above the horizon. Moon threw
some light on the object. Object passed over the moon. It was so close and
low.

Now - off the subject. There have been accounts in the newspaper.
So many people have seen UFOs that there must be something to them. In May
I set shrubs out and watering them, and have been looking twice a week from
1100 (2300) - 0100 while watering these. I have had opportunities for considerable
observations. I have been looking for it. Stars helped to illuminate it and
so did the moon. Object was about one mile distant. Moon 3/4 full, I
checked with the calender. Big exhaust threw illumination on the object.
Only viewed it for about thirty seconds.

Body shape like a rocket. Couldn't be real definite.
Body color was dusky brown. Could tell from illumination. Couldn't
be real certain.


- page 14 -

Exhaust was silhouetted against the sky. Big bell shaped coming around a dark streak through the center. Perfect silhouette against the sky. One penny would cover it.

One thinks it takes a larger object to cover it when its low.

When it gets high in the sky you don't need anything so big.

There was this white with a dark streak. Pretty sure of the exhaust size. Can compare it with the moon. Looking straight East and off to the right saw a light coming from south sky and steadily coming closer. This object passed in back of a street light. Then I could see what was coming.

Could see the body shape then. It was at 30 deg first then at a 45 deg angle. No sound. Have heard helicopters, jets, aircraft, etc before. Just no sound. Maybe if it was closer I would have heard a noise. A piper cub at that distance would have made a noise. No sound on this. Strange thing when it came directly in front of me at a 45 deg, the exhaust went off like a light switch. Then when it came back on 5 seconds later it was just like somebody had turned on a light switch. No change in the speed. For the time viewed I had a watch on but I was so awe struck, just froze. I saw aircraft overseas. I just turned my head, I was so awe struck. Didn't have light enough to look at my watch. I retimed it later. Object didn't disappear. High trees 150 ft high blocked it off. I froze so that I didn't move, guess if I would have moved I could have saw it again but I just froze. Estimated speed of 300mph. Went considerably slower than a jet. Similar to a prop plane. It was slow and low. Think it was doing some observing.

I feel that the 1000 ft alt is about 50% accurate. Not real high, possibly 2000 ft alt. Everything was so plain. Don't think it was real low

Here is the text from the document:

for it was over the tree tops and above the houses. Moon was 15 deg elevation in the eastern sky, object was 45 deg elevation. Exhaust was so large could see the body fairly well, so I think it was 1000 ft alt. It is hard to tell altitude. First saw it in the southern sky. The angle seemed to be from the southwest. Would have come across the Youngstown factories, twenty miles of steel factories. (Mr. Howells named approximately 10 - 15 steel factories and other factories here). It couldn't help but go over the mills.

No haze or clouds, none any where. There were countless stars in the sky.

Looking directly to the east when I noticed light first appear. Just at edge of vision when I first noticed it. Frequently saw aircraft. Think the air strike was in effect. Airport 5 miles north of us. See jets pass, planes going east to west, the Air Force planes going east and west, going all night long. Can hear the jets even when they are only specks. I didn't observe any protrusions, tail fins, stubby wings, etc. Perhaps this was due to the whiteness. It wasn't a dazzling white but more like a white in a candle. Didn't blind your eyes. Wasn't as white as a star. More like the white of a candle. Similar to a fluorescent light. Little brighter than a candle.

Body shape right in front, dusky brown. It appeared a little larger than 3/4 of the moon. 15 - 30 deg above the moon. Think the angle is pretty close. Believe I am within 5 deg. I went out Saturday morning. I called it into the 907 troop Squadron, Major Hall. Used to have a Jet Fighter Squadron at Youngstown. Used to be going night and day about 10 years ago. Going mostly South. Called out there. I have only mentioned it to a few people. I have come to the conclusion for the fact of national security that people get worked up that I think it is best to keep it quiet. When I am busy I forget

3


- page 16 -

about it. Doesn't prey to much upon my mind. Somebody suggested I report it.
Hadn't heard of Project Blue Book. Didn't like newspaper publicity. If it
is the Russians don't let them know we know about it. Don't want to excite
people. If anybody would ask about it, then I am not going to tell anybody
about it.

Called Troop Squadron on Saturday and asked to speak to officer.
Had a meeting with Major Hall on what I saw, he had a steno. Also gave him a
mistaken report of 1/2 dollar on the size. Not going to say anything more
to any civilian. Think it is a matter of national security that I keep quiet.
(Major Quintanilla informed [redacted] that we would check into it.)

I have a pair of bx in the house but object would have been gone. I
couldn't go for binoculars nor for a witness. Caught me completely by surprise.
My mind has never played any tricks so I observed twice a week for two hours.
I have been looking for something like this. Heard what everybody had been
seeing. The only improvement that could have been in my observation would
have been for it to go right overhead. If I hadhad binoculars it would have
been helpful.

Youngstown will have radar in January but it will only detect for
40 miles. These UFOs come over in early morning hours. In the spring there
was a Sheriff Deputy that saw one near East Liverpool. Northeastern Ohio
area seems to be a good tracking area. Ashtabula had one on the ground not
too long ago that when he approached the spot it disappeared. Don't know
what he had to say. This is in Northeast Ohio. Teenagers saw something in
Erie. Can't believe everything in the newspapers. I heard about Martin Brutz
on 6 August, several objects from Niles, saw it in the Northeast at 0500 hours darting through binoculars for several hours.

4


- page 17 -

The darting was like a helicopter, might be capable of great speed. Seemed to be for the object to stay on straight course. Seems to be a different type of object than the ones that others have seen. There are more than one type of UFO you know. This is the only description that I can give. This is a mental image from the distance which I observed. I was fortunate to be so close to see such a large exhaust and I could make out the body fairly well.

I don't want my name released. Major Quintanilla informed Mr. [illegible] that he would not release his name to the newspaper. I have told about ½ dozen people, including physics teacher who said it could be Russian. Remember 1957 with Sputnik that the schools said we weren't quite as good as they are. Made us look pretty bad. Made me wonder. It was the 40th anniversary of the Communist Revolution in Russia. Next year it will be the 50th anniversary. Will that reveal that this next year they will go to the moon. Nothing we can do to stop them. We aren't as fast with our rockets to get to the moon first.

I sent a letter to MacNamera. It is something for the Defense Department. Perhaps they think it is best not to give it any notice. I don't want it to be like a dog's bone, it deserves a full discussion and airing. My mind has never played me any tricks.

Hall, I went down and talked to him personally. He didn't have any ideas. He was going to send a report in. He had a steno take the information down.

Now I would like to go into another subject. I would like to know if you believe in extra-sensory-perception. Anything is possible. Major replied that he had heard of Jean Dixon and a few others. Well there is a lady in Philadelphia who can describe a criminal and tell when a crime is

5


- page 18 -

taking place. Her extra-sensory works so that police believe her. I think
there is something to extra-sensory-perception. Read that archaeologists
predict that man will be able to communicate from mind to mind. Will take
thousands of years. Feel that I have extra-sensory-perception. So
certain that I don't pay attention to it. Just like a radio. Mine
isn't like seeing something going to happen. Can detect personality
even though I cannot see them. If person has a certain type of emotional
reaction I can see this. I went to western Reserve University in 1963 and
had a Dr. Allen, was head of education. He is precise man, formal, correct
in his manners and firm rather stern man. That is a picture of his personality.
I got to know him fairly well. I returned in 63' and going down the street,
just as I passed a building I had the feeling he was observing me from
his office across the street. He remembered me from 55'. Just as I passed
the building the feeling left.

I read late into the night. Cars go along the side of the house.
Lights go right through the walls of the house. Can't place any of them.
Get them as an emotional reaction.

Wasn't going back to teaching this fall. A school superintendent
lives in back of grandparents and I think somebody recommended me to him
because they are trying to get me to go to the boarding school and teach.
His wife is observing me through the house. I never met the Dr. Nicionger's
wife, supt of schools. These schools they check on the type of person they
hire. Get her personality of correct and formal kind person. I have been
out in the yard and observe his personality then turn and look around and
he is there. This happens with various persons. Putting applications in

6


- page 19 -

for teaching they come around and check your neighbors and I have received
a tip off and somebody goes by like a school superintendent. This happens
again and again. Have done it so many times that it is full proof. Haven't
even told my own relatives about this. So, I have this emotional sensory
perception. I can't look into the future. Just getting an emotional
reaction. Receiving a personality.

Observed it approaching from the South didn't get anything until
I looked directly up into the sky of those in the craft. Using high power
because I received an impression of him studying the ground. Never had
this reaction before. Had it from superintendent from closer range. I
felt it. Have been able to detect whether it was a man or a woman. Get
a different impression from a man than from a woman. This was a man observing
because I have observed by men before. Therefore, I had the same reaction.
Color white. His head was huge, was possibly due to the fact that he was
looking through a telescope. The white appearance was so because of the
high powered telescope. This telescope influenced the emotional reaction
through. Have never received such an emotional reaction. Getting a
mental picture of a man with a huge head. No facial features. Looking
down through high power telescope. Color was white because of image. His
emotion reaction (I pick this up easily) was very amused. Could see a big
grin like card player with an ace up his sleeve. He looked down below.
Grin came through. Amused reaction came through and I have had these reactions
from various people even when I am not looking. After the craft turned
light off the reaction just vanished. This observer had the amused face and
must have communicated with commander of craft. Saw a man with a small
head. He must not have had a telescope looking through. His disposition
was of an angry person. He also was a man. His reaction received a

7


- page 20 -

communication that somebody on the ground had spotted the craft that he gave
an explosive order. Could see this emotion. Exhaust went off right away.
Showed anger. This happened just when onny disposition ordered. Couldn't
tell color because of it being a small head. 75% Nationality. I know
the Russian people that were born in America. They are very much like us.
There is a little difference between the Russians and us. Couldn't tell
them from a lot of other people. 75% because his skin was white. That
must be Russian. If this craft were coming from another planet I would have
felt something strange in the emotional reaction. Didn't receive anything
strange to the emotional reactions as Americans do. Nothing strange like
people from other planets. French only other like cause other than
Russians. They are most likely ones because of no peculiarities like
people from another planet. I could be wrong. It is possible that people
from other planet would be similar to us that is why I say only 75%.
They may be built different but they have similar emotional reaction. Have
never been tested for this but it has always been true. A certain personality
comes along with the feeling. Purdue is working in ESP. I have never
discussed this with anyone. This is an emotional form of ESP. I have
received it so many times. Just like a radio. This case I was really being
focused in. This observer was concentrating onthe ground. I receive
an impression when the person is really focusing. I felt there was an
observer because of the feelings I got. It cast further light on what I
observed. Want to go completely into that as fully as I can. So, I have
also given this extra material on ESP. This is the first time I have given
this information out. Please do not publicize this information

8


- page 21 -

Jean Dixon doesn't mind publicizing this but I don't want it publi c.

He heard that there was a suggestn for colleges to investigate.
I think it should be the Air Force on Conad. Think this calls for action
and schools can't give action. Air Force is in a better situation.
Don't think it should go to the school.

I have noticed something in the last week or two. We have been
getting a lot more jets over our area. Saturday morning two jet fighters
were real low going East. Haven't had anything like this for a long time.
They haven't come up our way, but now we are seeing a lot more jets since
lately. Somebody must have put the word out to check that area. There
seems to be a good area if they want to make an investigation. Observe
them in the early morning. I just wanted to get this off my chest.

Dear Major Quintanilla;

I have a confession to make.
When I was in your office, Monday
afternoon, I decide tell you everything that
I know about the rocket shaped space
craft which passed over Girard, Ohio at
1 A.M., July 7th. This confession will make
me look bad but if it helps in the
defense of the United States, I'll just
forget my feelings.
I believe that in telling you this it
may tipe the balance scales as to whether
this craft was from another planet or
from Russia. I in this account, I believe
will seem to indicate that the scales are
tipping more toward Russia as the owner
of the probable nuclear space craft.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

at approx. 1 A.M. on the 9th, or 10th of
July (I didn't mark the date) & was sitting
in my bed room (2nd floor) reading.
I have a bedroom window which faces the
east. I the window casing, which frames the
window in my room is enameled glossy
white. The blind was pulled down.
The bedroom light was shining on the
window casing.

I felt the approach of this spacecraft
almost directly overhead; so I turned my head
toward the east bedroom window. I mentioned
to you that I have extra sensory perception)
Even though the bedroom light was on the
casing - a still brighter band of white light
approx. 12 in. wide moderately (approx. sec)
across the very top, north east side of the
casing at this bright band of white light moved
across the white lighted casing; I felt again
the very unusual emotional reaction of the
observer in this spacecraft looking down, through


- page 25 -

the high powered telescope which had recently experienced outside in the first yard at 1 A.M. on July 7th.

I heard no sound whatsoever, yet (( felt through extra sensory perception)) this craft passing overhead, yet possibly an 80° angle, it appeared the same slow speed (300 m.p.h.) as I had observed on July 7th.

It must have been closer than before because the apparent light came in the window so strong.

What makes me look real bad is that I didn't run to the window, pull the window shade aside and look directly up at that space craft. I lost a golden opportunity I lost, to have had a good look at the bottom side of the body of the craft!

Why didn't I more from my chair? I was still under the spell of awe and fear which I had experienced outside on July 7th.

However, I still go ahead and observe outside on clear nights until 2 A.M. in spite


- page 26 -

Here is the text from the document:

if that fear and awe which has pretty
well left me bygone. I don't believe
that it will be nearly so-me struck a
fearful, if I have the good luck to observe
it again.

I didn't say much about the shape of
the body of the craft when I talked with you.
I believe that I come honestly very beyond
doubt that it was a rocket shape, as it
passed near the moon, I had a pretty good
view. The moon, which was approx 30°
below the craft, threw some light on the body.
The body of this craft appeared flat and
broad whereas our rectilinear appears narrow
in proportion to their length.

If this craft were from another planet
would it be appearing over the same area
and going in the same direction, within a
three day period?

I have noticed that these craft have
been supporting on the northeast corner of
the state, is this an exit corridor from
the United States?


- page 27 -

Does the U.S. defense on the east coast extend up the east coast of Canada to meet the radar defense which goes across the middle of Canada? Or is there a way of going in the radar defense which would permit this craft to pass over Ontario, Quebec, and Labrador and out over the North Atlantic back to Russia?

Are the Russian cosmonauts so busy taking their training in the operation of their pride and joy, the new nuclear space craft "Lenin I", that they have no time to bother going up in space craft which are just put into orbit by rockets?

They official to be coming from the south southwest, are they coming into the United States through our southern states which border the Gulf of Mexico? I have heard that there is no radar defense there.

This space craft has all sorts of questions. I have a way to some of these questions.


- page 28 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

appears to rest in the hands of president
and science national government policy.
Off the craft... Regarding do we sit it
it down and risk having U.S. relations with
Russia go real sour when we have not
going main Viet Nam?
Off the craft is on another planet, and
we shoot it down we could get relations
with that planet off to a very bad start.
off the world yet back to the planet that the
United States had brought damn its space
craft; the average of very advanced planet
could mean the downfall of the United States.
Could we think that craft and determine
whether they are coming from Russia or
outer space?
If I am fortunate enough to see the
space craft again I will take a good hard
look at it, especially at the body of the craft.
I should call the Air Force fighter
squadron at Pittsburgh immediately and give
altitude and direction of the craft? I would
call them... a clear point possibly some of
identification.


- page 29 -

Here is the text from the document:

Could you give me th. phone number to call, so that I could get through quickly to the Pittsburgh Air Force Base? Would there be some way in which I could identify myself so that they would accept my report? I am telling, positively, no one else of my observations.

Sincerely yours

Sept. 12, 1966

Dear Major Quintanilla!

I haven't stopped thinking yet about that space craft which passed over Girard, Ohio on the 7th, and 10th, of July. I keep trying to write out of my mind, every last bit of information which might contribute something of value toward solving this puzzle.

I have noticed many more jet fighters passing over this area might and day than I have seen since they took the 9th Fighter Squadron from the Youngstown Air Base.

Just tonight, it appeared 8:30 P.M. (Daylight time) a jet fighter passed over, heading east and flying rather low. Visibility was hazy. I was talking to a high school teacher in the front yard.

The plane was possibly a mile distant when I received an emotional impression through E.S.P. I received the impression that the pilot was looking down and observing what was below him. I also received an impression of the pilot's personality - as a person who is humble and

[Note: The last line appears to be cut off]


- page 31 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

unassuming and young in years.

The emotional impression which I received from the Observer and the Commander in the space craft were quite different from that of the young American pilot in the jet fighter. I don't believe that I have ever had an emotional impression (but merely through extra sensory perception) as I did this emotional impression, which I received from the Observer in the space craft.

I received an impression that the Observer was looking down at the ground, through something. I believe that he was looking at the ground through a high powered telescope, rather than through a window in the craft. I believe that the high powered telescope must have greatly increased the power of this emotional impression which I received, it was something like turning up the volume on a radio set. You can, you'll stand the noise.

That very amused, self satisfied expression of the Observer, came through so overwhelmingly strong, that by given in this huge, white head, I believe also that the telescope magnified his head considerably.


- page 32 -

I'll transcribe the text exactly as it appears:

"I don't recall or - having received, stain color before. I believe that this must be due to the telescope increasing the power of the transmission of the impression.

The observer seemed like a man, possibly in his thirties while the commander seemed to be a man in his forties. They didn't give the youthful impression, as did the young American pilot who passed on that evening in the jet fighters.

The build of the commander was much smaller than that of the observer. This was probably due to the fact that he wasn't looking through the telescope. I mentioned to you that the disposition of the commander came through an inquiry, when he gave an angry explosive command, the exhaust light went out.

When this craft passed over (again on the 10th of July) I know that it was the same craft approaching before. I saw the bright, quite exhaust light shining on the light, with enameled window casing.

When I observed this craft outside that 10th of July, I received some odd strange, peculiar simultaneous impression from the craft as it was passing."


- page 33 -

Aug 21, 1966

Dear Major Quintanilla,

I can't stop thinking of the U.F.C. which I observed last month and its significance, implications and potential for the United States.

(Its exhaust was so - unusually large and broad and the body of the craft appeared massive.

The white exhaust was sharply outlined against the dark night sky, but the dark body of the craft was not clearly outlined against the dark background. As I said in my questioning that the body of the craft was of indefinite shape, the craft appeared to have this shape.)

Shortly after sighting the craft and while the image was still clear in my mind, I tried to compare what it would take to come to the conclusion that white exhaust light. I came to the conclusion that one fifty cent coin would only go about half way across the width of the exhaust light and that two-

[There is a small hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a triangular or wedge-shaped object in the middle of the text]


- page 34 -

This impression from the craft itself, now separate from the impression that I received from the Observer and Commander.

It was a new impression that I have never received before. Perhaps this impression come from the a posteriori silent pro/action system.

On the 10th of July I received this same strange peculiar impression from the craft itself by re-entering a/proached almost directly overhead, at an angle of approx. 75° above the horizon.

It is something like a hunting dog which is well trained to pick up the scent of one certain type of wild game.

I knew right away that it was the same craft.

If this craft re-passes through this slot again I know that I will be able to identify it immediately by this strange peculiar impression.

I received the amused impression same observer again, only the impression that I received was a set in my chest, in my bedroom, was not really so strong as the impression which I received outside.


- page 35 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

I believe that the walls of the house with insulation reduced the strength of the impression coming through.

I could then track the silent craft as it passed overhead, almost like radar, by the continuous, strange peculiar impression that I received from it.

The impression, which I received from it told me of power, where it was located, and the impression I got at which it was turning.

It seemed to be standing at approx. the same speed as on the 7th. of July, only this time, the direction was much closer to north than northeast.

It also seemed to be flying as low as I did on the 7th.

It should be corroborated for not getting the window cast, denying it, or it proved almost directly overhead.

But it's something like bumping into someone in the jungle, or takes on a little while to get used to something like that.

Firstly, I was in the relative backyard up in Board many, Ohio. I mentioned to you that the backyard of D.L. Merryck (Dept. of Boardman School) meets the backyard of my relative.


- page 36 -

I received an emotional impression from Dr. Nininger and his wife observing me inside their house with an assured but very emotionally restrained manner. He is about 20 ft. from me.

A couple of days later, I received another emotional impression from Dr. Nininger and his wife. This time, I noticed that they had arranged a little test for me. They sent a young man to the back of the yard (he appeared to be a school principal) and he was looking around in my direction.

At the same time, I received an emotional impression from Dr. Nininger and his wife that they showed major, very specifically restrained emotional manner. It appeared that they were trying to restrain much their emotions both trying - so that I could not locate emotional involvement.

My conclusion was that Dr. Nininger had received a little from your office inquiring so to speak then I informed him at that time. (If you'll note, merely for I needed to check on my reliability of E.S.P.)

I am sort of like the Chimpanzee, that a psychologist looks in - to know how he could


- page 37 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

observe him. The psychologist gave the chimps some playthings.

The psychologist looked through the peephole to observe the chimps and what do you think!

The chimps were looking through the peephole observing the psychologist.

Extra sensory perception has been a secret weapon. I hope that claim continues to keep the secret. People might think me to be a freak who belongs in a circus sideshow.

Three weeks ago, I was outside and observed the group of men from the National U.F.O. Commission in Washington.

They passed across the side street observing me, possibly trying to determine whether, I looked some and reliable. They were driving an official-looking car with Washington license plates. They passed across the street intersection so fast that while being went through the stop sign, I believe that their license plates in the car just noticed another official-looking car with Washington license plates go past on the side street. They are observing me again but I believe that there were only a few of them time.


- page 38 -

I hope that I most get them so myself in trouble for telling on them.

There is something that I neglected to tell you about the space crafts, change of direction of flight.

When I first saw it approaching it was coming from the south or southwest at an angle of approx. 30° above the horizon. As it moved across the eastern sky it was at an angle of approx. 45° above the horizon. During this time (approx. 10 sec.), it was traveling parallel to my point of observation.

As I looked straight up at it in the eastern sky (at a distance of approx. 1 mile) the exhaust light went out. After the exhaust light went out, I could see the body of the craft moving forward for approx. 5 sec.

When the exhaust light came back on, I noticed that the craft was now approx. 30° above the horizon, and that its direction of flight had been shifted, approx. 15° further toward the east.

I am continuing to keep quiet and am letting absolutely no one else know about these experiences.

Sincerely, [signature redacted]

No Case, Info Only, 7 Jolla, Ohio

July 10, 1966

Dear Sir:

I would like to make a report which may be of interest to the Defense Dept. I am a resident of Girard, Ohio which is in northeastern Ohio bordering Youngstown.

Thursday morning July 7th, at 1 A.M., I witnessed, along a mysterious sight such as I have never seen before.

I was watering some newly planted shrubs when I noticed a light approaching silently, from the southwest at an angle of 90 degrees about the horizon. It moved straight on course at an altitude of 1000 feet or more. As it came closer, and was silhouetted against the dark eastern sky, I had a better view.

I in shape was a white form shape with a dark section running through the center. It would have taken half a dollar bill, held at arms length to have covered the exhaust. It was absolutely silent, I heard no sound whatever.


- page 40 -

I could not detect any wing lights, tail lights, or lights of any kind in the dark mass of the body in front of the exhaust.

The exhaust shut off completely for a second or so and then came back on. There was nothing to block the view.

It seemed to be traveling at approx. the speed of a jet plane but there was no sound of any kind.

It appeared to be approx. 1 mile distant.

It traveled straight on course from the southwest toward the northeast.

There were no clouds. Visibility of the sky was excellent with countless stars in the background.

This is a sketch as it appeared to me.

I am a high school language teacher with considerable interest in science and the space age.

I am an infantry veteran of World War II.

I have flown many times in commercial planes.

I have observed for TV, nearly all the astronauts.

For clips at Cape (Kennedy).

I have tracked the Cape Echo-Titan - that have passed overhead in regular orbit.

There is a small hand-drawn sketch of a rocket or missile-like object in the middle of the page.


- page 41 -

I have observed many types of jetty propeller driven planes and dirigibles past somebody might said they but I have never seen anything much silently north with speed as did that craft.

My hearing and vision are excellent. I have never been subject to hallucinations.

I would like to take this opportunity to say that I believe the war in Vietnam has been conducted very well.

I for one am very thankful for the excellent leadership that Pres. Johnson and Sec'y of Defense McNamara have given the people of the United States.

The critics (in Congress, college, press) of our policy in Vietnam have been very disgustingly tormenting in their show-of-disloyalty.

Respectfully yours,

Here is the OCR text from the document:

fifty cent piece placed on on top of the other might not quite cover the width, it don't believe that four fifty cent comes placed together in a square would have fully covered the exhaust so I concluded in the questionnaire that it would require one half a dollar bill to completely cover the exhaust height. If you would the length of the one half a dollar bill perpendicular to the ground.

This appeared to be a different type of craft than Martin Brody of 77 desc and others have observed. H.C.F.O.'s that Martin Brody and others have reported are said to be able to move like a helicopter, only with great speed.

The craft which I observed moved steadily, straight ahead.

My observations have led me to draw some other conclusions.

Russia's space program has been originally quiet this year. Not one co moment has gone by. Could it be that Russia has been very secretly working on a crash program for a new space craft with a new propulsion system such as nuclear power or ionized light.


- page 44 -

Here is the text from the document:

Can it be that they have got most of the "bug" out of their new space craft, and are now using it for low-level observation of the United States before their secret becomes known to the world?

Can it be that they are planning or possibly these new space craft on its maiden flight to the moon next year, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution?

They like to celebrate the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution with something spectacular. They would want something unusually spectacular to celebrate their 50th anniversary for world-wide propaganda.

Such a Russian triumph and leap-frogging ahead of us would sure shake up the United States.

Does the C.I.A. have well placed informers in the Russian space program to keep us up-to-date on what the Russians are doing?

But if my conclusion might be correct, what could I do about it at this late date?

Sincerely yours,
