Dear [redacted] and the two [redacted]

The Office of the President has asked the Air Force to reply to your letter of recent date in which you reported seeing some unusual aerial phenomena in the sky over Dallas on February 15th.

A check of our records reveals that the Naval Reserve unit at Grand Prairie was flying practice flights in your area on that evening. They have no record of any unusual occurrence, so the fact that you watched them take off just as you observed something unusual in the sky must merely be coincidental. Their aircraft, NJ-13, which is the Navy version of the Air Force P-36, are painted with fluorescent red and white paint so that you may have observed others of their flight during a period when the last rays of the sun cause the color red and made it seem like "red objects" to you.

Many times, after the sun has set and it is dark, objects very high in the sky still continue to catch the sun's rays and give an unusual appearance to persons on the ground. Balloons can give this appearance, even high-flying birds with a great deal of white on their undersides.

We are attaching three brochures, one for each of you, on the Air Force program on Unusual Aerial Phenomena. This brochure will give you additional information on sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects and explain how the Air Force investigates and evaluates these reports.

Thank you for reporting this observation. We hope its explanation will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,
[Coordination section with details]
C. R. CARLSON
