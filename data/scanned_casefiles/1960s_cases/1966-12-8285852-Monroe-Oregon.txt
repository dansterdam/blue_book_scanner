My wife & I were going northeast from Monroe. We were sick so I said to my wife "let's get out of the car to get some air". We were about 1/2 mile from town. There was a blank & then a brightness. I was parked back at the trunk of the car. My wife was close. We were parked back against her. We saw three stripes upon ground going across & we saw one stopped & the two others circled & lined up. We were straight from a 90 & 5. When they stopped we could see three lights, reddish orange. When they were circling we could see the lights & that it was solid. It was pitch dark. We had been making but at that time it was not. Of the three were of a moderate size. Then matters were of a more serious nature. I could see still my wife was quite nervous. Sometimes when they stopped they shot off the nearest everything was quite a shock. My wife was screaming as I got in the car & again off. They followed us about 1/2 miles then they stopped. My wife was tense. They went from the car as we drove down the road. They stopped. Then we went to a drive-in about 10 miles where the tension was. They got out & went out & watched for about 10 min. & we went back into house & both went to bed. I watched from our kitchen window until 4:38 & then to bed. They were in some area. Could see them plane from here although they were almost five miles away. (Then this helps give... your study you'll understand more)
