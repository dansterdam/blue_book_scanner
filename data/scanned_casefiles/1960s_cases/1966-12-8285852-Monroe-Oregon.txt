The image appears to contain a page from an old Project Blue Book document. It does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten narrative provided by the witness in response to a questionnaire. The text in the document is as follows:

"My wife and I were driving, may be 1 mile as I left the farm to go to work (I am a carpenter) she noticed something unusual in the sky. I have never seen anything like this before. In the air was an object that seemed to stay in the same place, no noise, no trail of any kind, and I would estimate it was about 5 to 1 miles high. The object seemed round like a saucer and reflecting light. When they appeared to be dimming, we drove at a faster speed to get a better view, but the object still seemed to stay in the same spot. I finally had to go to work so I did not see what happened to this object. I think it is very important that this be investigated by the proper authorities as I have never seen anything like this before and was very fascinated and awed by what we saw. This is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth as we saw it.
