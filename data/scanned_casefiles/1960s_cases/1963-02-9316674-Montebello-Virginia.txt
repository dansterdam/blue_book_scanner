6. DETAILS OF SIGHTING: Object appear as bright star-like light varying in intensity. Large oval shaped object with red light on underside. Object hovered for about 30 minutes and then disappeared over a ridge. Observer noticed object appeared to vary in size. Total elapsed time of sighting was 45 minutes. First observation of an object and in 45 minutes sighting disappeared. Description as astronomical, but location and sighting characteristics indicate this possibility is remote. Observation of an astro-body normally would not produce the described effects and sighting duration. Source appears to be an aircraft, possibly the VEGA.
7. COMMENTS: Report was in the southern area at report time and in 45 minutes sighting disappeared. Description and duration of sighting indicate this was not an astronomical observation but possibly an aircraft, possibly the VEGA.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document describes a sighting of a UFO near Washington, D.C. on the night of February 6th, 1963. The document mentions that a Convair aircraft was seen with strobe lights and flashing landing lights during the incident.

Text extracted from the document:

I. FLIGHT SERVICE PASSED ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO
WASHINGTON AIR DEFENSE SECTOR.
I. NASA CONVAIR WAS WORKING WITHIN A 25 NM RADIUS OF
QUANTICO FROM 00402 TO 06202. CONVAIR HAD STROBE LIGHTS,
ALSO FLASHED LANDING LIGHTS OCCASIONALLY DURING THE
PERIOD.
E. CAPT MARVIN E. FOREMAN, JR, BASE OPERATIONS DUTY OFFICER,
IN VIEW OF THE RELATIVE LOCATION OF THE LOGAIR PILOT'S
POSITION TO THAT OF THE NASA CONVAIR, IT IS BELIEVED THAT
THE LOGAIR PILOT SAW THE LIGHTS OF THE CONVAIR.

THE UNDERSIGNED IS FAMILIAR WITH EFTO MESSAGES,
REF APR 205-53

A UFO was seen near Washington, D.C. on the night of February 6th, 1963. Two small lights that could not be identified were observed. The UFO appeared off their right wing at a distance of several miles, and then two additional lights were observed, one above and one below the original lights, in close formation. The lights were white, and appeared to be about ten feet in diameter. The light from the UFO was so bright that it cast reflections on the plane.

U. S. SIGHTINGS (S).
January 4, 1963, Montebello, Virginia.
Moving object flying near Washington, D.C.
Was sighted by Capt. C. Chambers, Jr. at a little after 7:00 PM. It was a yellowish-white light, the size of a car, moving fast at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. John P. Campbell, reporter on the Williams-port Pa. (Sun-Gazette) , The FAA tower at Washington had confirmed the UFO sighting.
The UFO had a yellowish-white glow, and suddenly disappeared at a high rate of speed. About 15 minutes later, the object was sighted again, hovering low over Montebello, Va. and Charles W. Vest saw the same object on this second sighting.
It was about 10 minutes south of Washington, D.C., moving at a high rate of speed. A few minutes later, the witness saw the object again south of Washington.
Half a minute later, the witness saw the object again, this time at a lower altitude. At this point it was estimated to be traveling at a speed of about 1,000 mph (1,600 kph) during the fastest part of the observation.
The UFO was then lost from sight, and was not seen again.

February 1963: Special comments: I think that Case # 2 might be the same as observed in the southeast, but too far north-northeast to be the same object. It must have been a different phenomenon. Based on their shape and probable accounted for phenomena, I must child the intensity of the brightness of the reports. This will keep them on other members of the committee, and I seem to be in general agreement with you, except that, in general, our identification seems positive in our identification.
