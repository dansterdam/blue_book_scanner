10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
1) Object at 3-5 deg elevation 55 deg azimuth moving slow. To SW under observation for 15 minutes. Described as spherical light varying in intensity from 1m to bright with gradual. Observation from A/C. Sharp inversion.

2) Object appeared to vary in size. Large toward end of sighting. Large round starlike, Brilliant with reddish glow. Five times brighter than brightest star. Disappearance at 15-20 deg elevation.

11. COMMENTS
Star was in the southeast at 5 deg elevation at initial report time and in 45 minutes had risen to about 15-20 deg. Sighting is characteristic of an observation of an Astro body. Motion, duration, direction of travel conform with this analysis. Sharp inversion in area probably contributed to the distortion of appearance.

I. FLIGHT SERVICE PASSED ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO
WASHINGTON AIR DEFENSE SECTOR.

J. NASA CONVAIR WAS WORKING WITHIN A 25 NM RADIUS OF
QUANTICO FROM 0040Z TO 0620Z. CONVAIR HAD STROBE LIGHTS,
ALSO FLASHED LANDING LIGHTS OCCASIONALLY DURING THE
PERIOD.

K. CAPT MARVIN E. FOREMAN, JR, BASE OPERATIONS DUTY OFFICER.
IN VIEW OF THE RELATIVE LOCATION OF THE LOGAIR PILOT'S
POSITION TO THAT OF THE NASA CONVAIR, IT IS BELIEVED THAT
THE LOGAIR PILOT SAW THE LIGHTS OF THE CONVAIR.

THE UNDERSIGNED IS FAMILIAR WITH EFTO MESSAGES,
REF APR 205-53

A UFO WAS SEEN NEAR WASHINGTON, D.C. ON THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 6TH
BY TWO MEN FLYING A PRIVATE PLANE, AND VISUAL CONFIRMATION WAS MADE BY ANOTHER
PLANE, THOUGH NOTHING SHOWED UP ON WASHINGTON RADAR. FROM SOUTH
WILLIAMSBURG, PA, TOLD REPORTERS THAT HE AND ANOTHER MAN WITH HIM SAW THE OBJECT FOR NEARLY AN HOUR, WHILE FLYING FROM CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA. TO WASHINGTON.
THE UFO APPEARED OFF THEIR RIGHT WING AT A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL MILES, AND
MOVED TOWARD, UNDER AND ABOVE THE AIRCRAFT. IT HOVERED AWHILE, AND LATER WENT
ABOUT 25 MILES IN 5 SECONDS. THE OBJECT SEEMED TO HAVE A BALL-LIKE SHAPE, AND
ESTIMATED IT TO BE ABOUT TEN FEET IN DIAMETER. THE LIGHT FROM IT WAS
SO BRIGHT THAT IT LEFT A REFLECTION ON THE PLANE...

U.S. SIGHTINGS:
NICAP-Jan-Feb 1963... A strange fast-moving object flying near Washington D C was sighted on Feb 7 by Carl O Chambers, a linden, PA pilot and photographer, and John P Campbell, reporter on the Williamsport Pa (Sun-Gazette). The FAA tower at Washington Airport said another pilot had confirmed the UFO sighting.

The UFO had a yellow-white glow, and was first seen at 5500' near Charlottesville, VA. At one time the object hovered off their right wing, then moved rapidly under and above them. A few minutes later it was seen 35 miles south of Washington, seemingly hovering over a defensemissile site. Half a minute later, the witness said it reappeared 10-15 miles north of the Capital. (An indicated speed of over 5,000 mph) During the rest of the time the UFO was observed, it was estimated to be moving at about 2,000 knots.

February, 1963, special comments: I think that Case 2 must be Vega rather than Spica since the azimuth is listed as 55°, and Spica would be in the southeast, not the northeast. Reference to the handy dandy star map shows that Vega was just on the horizon at that time in the northeast. It is also a bright star than Spica and probably accounted for the observation. I must chide the committee on this one; none of the three other members caught the discrepancy in azimuth. This will keep them on their toes! For the rest of February the committee and I seem to be in general agreement with you, except that, in general, we are less positive in our identification.
