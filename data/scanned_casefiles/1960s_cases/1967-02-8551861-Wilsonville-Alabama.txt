#1 One of my sightings was February 10th. I saw it around 7:00 PM. The UFO was star shaped. It was a red luminous body. I first saw it in the south east. It was approx 5° above the horizon. It was as bright as Sirius and 3 times as large as Venus. I barely made out a faint white light in the rear of the one UFO. Slowly saw the white light in the rear for the first few minutes. About the time it got on the east it started pulsating. When it started pulsating it was about 9° above the horizon. It kept on going toward the north. When it was in the north it was a little lower that at first about 15° lower. All the time I saw it get dimmer little by little. What first drew my attention to it was its size, bright red color and brightness. There was no sound. I saw it for about 15 minutes. There was no vapor trail, halo, or exhaust. It pulsated about once a second.

#2 The other one was about [illegible text] on [illegible text]. There was approx 12. They were [illegible text]
