UFO Investigation Unit
Andrews Air Force Base
Maryland

Dear Sirs:

I wish to report this, at approximately 8:10 this evening, while driving towards the east through the Georgetown University Medical Area, I saw an extremely unusual object flying through the sky. The object was a bright, flashing turquoise and gold. It was headed towards the north and appeared to be losing altitude. I watched the object for about five or six seconds, until it disappeared behind some trees. I thought that it was an aircraft going down in flames, but I did not hear any explosion or other unusual sounds at the time of the sighting. The object was relatively large and slow-moving. It was a startling thing to see, and I would be very surprised if no-one else saw it. If I have no particular theory as to the nature of this object.

Sincerely,

Mr. [redacted] = (Kingston [redacted])

Mr. [redacted] reported that the UFO had passed at low altitude north wind over West Charley toward Woodstock and crashed near Mead Mountain -- His report was second hand. Even an ATC (West Charley [redacted]) who apparently thought it was a jet aircraft. She reported that it crashed with a loud explosion at about 20:15hrs.

[redacted] (Allenville [redacted]) reported that the object passed at an altitude of 10,000 - 20,000' or lower over Allenville. He stated that he was sure it was a jet aircraft. He said it was burning with a magnesium type fire and that it crashed, and two loud booms were heard.

[redacted] (Crane Ready, Carmel, NY [redacted]) reported the object passed at high altitude over Carmel, NY at a 010° heading. He saw it broke up high above the ground and saw the piece falling.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

1700 hrs?   Maj. Allman of 1st AF Personnel advised that the
"US Flag must be flown half Staff on 26 Apr 66 for the
death of former Sec of Defense, Mr. Louis Johnson. The
ADC deep was advised at 1700 hrs. a confirmation with the ADC
2020hrs.

Unidentified Flying Object: The ADC's office
was suddenly swamped with telephone calls reporting a
UFO at about 2020hrs. At first all calls indicated that
a jet aircraft had crashed about 20-30miles north of
Stewart AFB. So many incoming calls were being
received by this office that it was unable to contact
base operations or initiate and carry-through the normal
emergency notification. (Telephone calls were received continuously until about 2200hrs)

In a very few hrs I was able to get the
information to at least a few Command and Operations
individuals I contacted Col Johnson, Col Gould and attempted
to contact Col Moore.

By the time I was able to emerge with the emergency notification I had determined
that the incident was not an aircraft accident and therefore
did not carry out the notification process.

At no time did the ADC's office make or release
even a guess as to the nature of the UFO. To our
surprise, several news agencies called and indicated that they
had heard that an official information release, had been made by
Stewart AFB. The source of this alleged release could not
be traced and in point of fact, this press was the first
best second-hand. At approximately 2200hrs we were informed that
Griffiss AFB had released an official statement.

An attempt was made to receive all telephone calls and
record the names and telephone numbers and all information
reported. Some of this information is on the attached pages.

Observation & Recommendation: I feel that the base
operators did a fine job - and in the preventive mode, impacting
upon them - is not the simple fact that they did not
simply "give up". The problem is that for a while
we had all night, then even for a while after, during
& trying at us. For a time it was impossible to even
try to initiate a notification. Recommend: that in
such a situation at least one line be avoided by
the operators, so that out bound calls can be made.

Commander,
Stewart Air Force, Inc.
Newburg, N.Y.

Dear Sir:

Tonight at about 7:15 three
passed over this village, one of those U.A.O's.
It was some kind of object giving
off light between magnesium flare and caused
the sky glow north to north east a height of
approximately 500 ft. I'm speed was similar
to that of a shooting star and light as proper
or smoke trail which lasted for about five
minutes after it disappeared.

There was no hallucination as it
was still daylight, but it was so brightness
that drew my attention to it as I was sitting at
a picture window and had a perfect view.

I write this to you only because CBS TV
mentioned you have an interest in the, the, the
middle-man reported sighting one there. In-as-
evitably, the same one flying.

Yours very truly,

Newburgh, N.Y.

Gentlemen:

This will confirm my telephone report of this evening to Sgt. Kennedy. The U.S. incident in question occurred as follows; sighted this date:

Witnessed by: Myself, of Kingston; my son, of Kingston, age 15; of Kingston, age 17; several other neighbors.

Our location: Standing on Cedar Street which is in direct center of City of Kingston.

Time of sighting: 8:20 P.M.

Trajectory: From general direction of Eddyville-Rifton, diagonally across City of Kingston, toward general direction of Woodstock. Approximate South West to North East direction.

Altitude: Not too high; rough estimate of less than one mile.

Description: Very large; funnel shaped, with large part in front; Blue-Green color (bright), with yellow and red flashes emitting from rear. Entire body appeared to be solid mass - no wings.

Speed: Tremendous speed; traveled out of our vision in approximately 5 seconds.

Sound: Made absolutely no noise.

Vapor Trail: Left large, very distinct vapor trail which appeared much like those left by Jet Aircraft.

Visibility: Excellent; dusk; cloudless sky.

Opinion: This appeared to be no aircraft that we have ever seen before. We clearly observed this object in its path across Kingston, N.Y. 12401

Kingston, N. Y.
26 April 66

To:
4603 Headquarters Squadron
Stewart A. P.
Newburgh, N. Y.

Subject: UFO sightings of 25April 66

Dear Sir:

The following is a report of two sightings of objects in the sky on the night of 25 April 66. Witnesses in both cases were Mrs. Inno, three children, neighbors and myself. Our position at the time was on Union Center Rd. in Ulster Park, N. Y. which is approximately eight miles south of Kingston, N. Y. between town of Rifton and W.

The occurrences went as follows:

At approximately 8:10 - 8:15P.M. a flickering light drew my attention to the sky where I saw what I believed to be a meteor, approaching at high altitude from the S.SW in a direct path slightly to the north, passing over St. Remy area and passing on to the N. NE. The object was heard by a red mass with a blue to green trail approximately 4-5 times the size of the mass. Because of the high elevation we witnessed burnout and disintegration of it above the horizon. A hissing noise was heard by all and sounded much like a sky rocket. We estimated by height and size that the disintegration in the area just north of the Kingston Rhinecliff Bridge in the vicinity of Red Hook, approximately 90 seconds following disintegration we heard what could be described as sonic boom probably from its entrance into atmosphere. Because of our elevation and relatively good visibility, I could say that the track did not continue beyond the horizon but did burn out completely.

Thirty minutes later reports started to come in over my uncles two-way radio. 1k 1C next vehicle was sighted hovering in the Red Hook area. The station first sighting it described it as an oval shaped brilliantly lit and around 1,000 ft in length. Further reports stated that it was moving in a S. South Westerly direction at rapid speed.

Subsequent sightings were slightly west of Rhinecliff on the east bank of the Hudson. At this point we again went outside and immediately sighted the object(UFO) at an estimated altitude of 11-12,000 ft. Approaching from the Rhinecliff area. Passing to the south of us over Esopus, it steadily gained altitude and at what I would say was the rate of a 352 under full power, leaving no trail of any kind. At an estimated altitude of 30,000 ft. it gained speed and finally disappeared from view in the sky somewhere over Monticello area.


- page 31 -

Description of the vehicle was oval, looking much like a blimp but at least eight times larger than I've seen before. It was brightly illuminated over its entire surface with band of bright-er light extending from the front and taping off towards the rear of the vehicle. From further reports over the two way radio we learned that those who made the first sightings were doing to contact Poughkeepsie airport and Stewart Field. The sightings were confirmed by at least 6 other ham radio operators. It is as evident from the press releases that the presence of the second sighting was obscured by the excitement of the first.

I also add that I have just completed four years with the Air Force and all the things I've witnessed nothing compares with that which we saw last evening. Please forward me information as to proper channels for future reference.

Thank you.
Very truly yours,

[Name redacted]

Dear Sir,

I was evening, circa 25. I was
outside and all of a sudden I saw white
lighted balls at motionists, latter I
heard on the news to pass a motion
but I do not believe so because
it was much too fast for a
plane and much the plane for a
motionists. We was a sidewards dull.
I was slow softly after sundown
would write back to me telling me what
you think I do see. Others will
certainly be no definite answer but
I am wondering about it.)

Thanks of you,

P.S. I am very interested in science

Flower and Cook Observatory Reprint No. 171

The Great Bolide of April 25, 1966
CHARLES P. OLIVIER, Director, American Meteor Society

ON THE ABOVE DATE, at about 7:14 p.m. Eastern standard time, a remarkable bolide entered the earth's atmosphere over the eastern United States. Traveling northward very slowly, it finally broke into fragments left a long enduring train.

Immediate steps were taken to collect eyewitness reports. In eastern Maryland at the time, the writer telephoned the Washington Evening Star, which then published a call for observations.

From this I received perhaps 50 reports. SIXTY AND TELEGRAMS applied the original accounts used in its June article, while the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia furnished many others. Eventually, the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base sent in a large number, as did the National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena.

In all about 200 reports were assembled, including those from American Meteor Society members. Although the description varied in accuracy and usefulness, enough data were collected to permit deriving quite an accurate path for the bolide. After the preliminary path had been found, it was checked against a large number of reports received later from the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. The writer is grateful to all these institutions and to the reporting observers for making the computation of the path possible.

Although several excellent photographs included were not satisfactory, no facts were given as to their heights and directions, so exact measurements were impossible. However, one print from Dennis Cassin at Thornwood, New York, showed the moon, giving a good position for a point on the meteor train. The other photographs indicated the path's approximate slope and showed the train drift, but no accurate altitudes or accurate reduction procedure was followed.

A large-scale chart was prepared covering the whole region, with one millimeter representing one minute of arc in latitude. The observer stations were well plotted and azimuth lines drawn in the directions reported for the points on the meteor's trail. We were fortunate in having a number of observers near Princeton, New Jersey, all of whom reported that the bolide crossed the zenith. Their mean positions gave a very accurate point on the projected path.

The map shows the beginning and somewhat south of the beginning point we determined, but efforts to obtain reports from the area further south did not succeed. Newspapers there did not give local reports but reprinted northern ones. But what we have assigned as the beginning point seems a good anchor for the project path. Over New York State a preliminary path was drawn, but later a secondary burst (B), followed by two more; the main ones gave fairly well-defined points. The end point was determined as well as could be, although I had few Canadian observations.

Some reports were of exceptional value, such as those from observers who saw the path seen from their stations. One observer each in Washington and Baltimore made more and was instrumental in measuring altitude and direction of the path. Many persons gave more or less accurate estimates of the direction.

The preliminary projected path was almost due north, and the final direction was from 1.5 west to south to 1.5 east of north. This can hardly be more than a degree in error. Now that the projected path was determined, a vertical diagram was constructed. The observed altitude angles were corrected for the earth's curvature (which is important in meteor work, as in many cases) and from them 95 estimates of heights were determined, not counting the six zenith sightings. More weight was assigned to heights that depended on actual measurements, then to triangulated points in the sky or actual measurements. Then a straight line was drawn through these points. It was possible. From this diagram, the slope of the path was 6° 44', which must be construed as —8° 20' for the earth's curvature, so that at the end point of the path the observed altitude of the radiant was 3° 24'. In each orbit calculation, the appropriate corrections were applied. Usually in meteor calculations only whole degrees have real significance.

AMERICAN METEOR SOCIETY FIREBALL NO. 2388
[Table with detailed meteor observation data]

Here is the OCR text from the document:

but minutes of arc were retained in this
work, and final results were rounded off
to 0.1.

The vast majority of observers saw the
fireball as blue, green, or green-white over
most of its path, but a few reported a
change to yellow or orange towards the
end, after disintegration. Magnitude estimates scatter from -4 to -18 because of
differences in distance to the path and
in observer training. Disregarding distance, the arc of 58 estimates is -10.
Many observers compared the angular
diameter of the fireball with the moon's,
their results ranging from 8' to 30'.

Very near its end, the bolide was captured in three photographs by Veronica
Schwarz at Radwinsmill, New York,
showing the fireball's path and disintegration. At the last picture on the
June, 1966, cover show, fully a dozen
large fragments and many smaller ones
appear. This multiplicity added to the
difficulty of distant observers in fixing the
end point.

The observers were able to calculate
bolide took to traverse it. We sought to
calculate the average velocity through the
atmosphere by combining observed velocities and duration in the 20 cases where both
were recorded. The average velocity
comes out 25.5 = 6.60 kilometers per second, and the overall duration 3.1 seconds.
Three orbits were calculated for the
meteoroid in space around the sun: el-

lipse, parabola, and hyperbola. These
correspond respectively to velocities of
12.5, 18, and 23.5 kilometers from the
corresponding velocities relative to the
earth are 12.5, 18, and 23.5 kilometers a
second, the last being the observed value.
However, if the actual orbit lies between
the elliptical and the parabolic cases, the
body might have come from the asteroidal
zone, since the orbital inclination to the
plane of the ecliptic is not too large.

After the fireball had passed through
the atmosphere, its train lasted so long
that a nonuniform drift would be expected. Photographs show that it did
not remain straight but appeared wavy,
the irregularities being small except near
the end. The train was compared in an
appearance to the trail left by a jet airplane, and many descriptions indicate the
word "smoke."

Two observers, D. B. Smith (Pittsburgh, New York) and D. K. Speed (Glastonbury, Connecticut), charted both the
general drift of the train and found the
path of the train was westward, but it developed humps that made the
direction of motion unclear. Four other
observers described the travel as to the
west, two to the east.

T. D. Nicholson (Woodcliff Lake, New
Jersey) observed the train in much
detail. He noted its general drift as to
the west-northwest, and that it started

15° southwest of the zenith and was vis-

ible to 10° above the horizon, which was
formed by buildings. This report is significant because many observers in Virginia, Maryland, and southern New Jersey did not mention a train. He stated specifically that there was none.
Most of these people saw only the first
part of the path.

From all the evidence, we infer that
the train (T) began to be visible at a
height of 90 kilometers, about 200 kilometers from the beginning point of the
path, and then extended in some form
or other to the end.

Just before this paper was completed,
H. Olah's very full discussion of the
fireball of January 14, 1966, over Poland
and Germany appeared in Mitteilungen
der Astronomischen Gesellschaft. This
also had a very long, almost horizontal
path, and its apparent magnitude was
-11. On various assumptions, he calculated a diameter from 0.6 to 1.5 meters
and a mass from 500 to 6,000 kilograms.
The analogy suggests that the April 28th
bolide was somewhat larger, and that it
would have dropped meteorites. The
debris, if any, would have fallen on Canadian territory, and for this reason P. M.
Millman of Ottawa has also made a detailed derivation of the path.

William Blizstein, of the University of
Pennsylvania astronomy department, has
given me valuable advice on certain
points of this study.

Fire Ball 'a Meteor'
(Continued from Page 1)

200 to 300 miles... "we really" Another woman called the Press, yelling "What are you going to do about this? Everyone here is scared to death... do something."

Neither did John P. McHale, city editor of the Press, who on his way back to newspaper after dinner, said "the object itself was more green than blue in color, and the trail was colorless and the vapor trail was visible for quite a length of time."

Police departments were also bombardered with calls.
At Ilion, police said they had 17 calls in 15 minutes.

State Police at East Herkimer said they had between 60 and 70 calls. A trooper said the most reported as explosion.

The object was more or less identified by the majority of the callers as a spectacular display of color. Most reported the object exploded "like a Roman candle" with as many as a dozen "greenish" sparkles. Some persons reported the object separated into two. Most agreed the object was very high, while others as low as 100 feet.

The Associated Press said it had reports from Maine to Ohio.

In Utica, the first caller said she saw "an object near Deer field Hill," thought it was a plane on fire.

In Rome, police handled 12 calls in 10 minutes.

A General Electric executive who lives in New Hartford, said he was at a Route 12 filling station when he spotted "a green object, with a fiery white tail, high in the sky that exploded sending a fan."

Montgomery County Deputy Sheriff LaVerne Trommer, of Hagaman, said he saw it from his living room window—"a fantastic sight."

It was the second time in four days that calls was received in the state reporting a bright object in the sky that burned out after several seconds.

Twenty Air Force reservists meeting outside Rochester said the ball of light maintained a very steady, flat trajectory.

However, there were many conflicting reports where some objects looked like and where it was headed. But most witnesses said it was headed to north, in a reddish, blue and white, colors of the New York Times and white, New Service reported.

The majority of the sightings occurred about 8:15, from mainly Boston to Washington.

Dr. Asher Chapman, an examiner for the F.A.A., said that he rushed to the window of his Glen Cove home to see the object traveling "about 1,000 feet above ground, 300 to 400 miles an hour, from south to north."

Assistant Professor Anthony Aven at Hamilton College said "it sounds exactly like a giant fireball, a bright meteor... all uncommon... except for pictures of it. We observe three or four a year. The public is especially conscious of things in the sky and everyone is busy watching these days because of publicly given to UFO's."

Aven said he "ruled out anything but it being a meteor since it wasn't picked up by radar."

Dr. Curtis Hemenwey, director of the Dudley Observatory in Albany, the AP reported, said, "as near as I can judge it was a meteor bright enough and big enough to indicate that a meteorite should have fallen somewhere north of Albany."

Hemenwey said he would like to get some sightings and photographs. "In hope of finding the meteorite."

David Fisher, a professor in the engineering physics department at Cornell University, said what most observers saw was a bright ball giving off sparks before it was extinguished "probably was little asteroids."

EXCITEMENT AT PROCTOR-Dana DeGeorge, left, and Vincent Fernia, were the talk of Proctor High School today. Everyone wanted to see the camera that history was made.

Utica Observer-Dispatch - 26 Apr 66

Thousands See Fireball

Young Utican's $8 Camera Puts 'Something in the Sky' on Film
By GARY STRANGES

Dana DeGeorge didn't get much sleep last night, what with an interview from the Utica newspapers and a telephone call from the New York Times. Looks as though the picture he took of a fireball winging its way across the night sky will be keeping him awake for nights to come.

Dana, 14, thinks the fireball just might be a UFO, but some authorities say it was a meteor. (UFO is, of course, an unidentified flying object.)

The Proctor High School freshman and a friend snapped the picture last night as Dana's $8 used 35mm camera.

THE FIREBALL, identified by a number of authorities as a meteor, excited thousands from the Eastern Seaboard to Ohio and as far south as the Carolinas.

In Utica and Central New York, the spectacle prompted a flurry of calls to police agencies and rave reviews from a number of other onlookers.

The photo that came out, revealing a spectacular ball of fire and tail, was beamed nationally by The Associated Press.

Dana said he is sending an enlargement of the photo that appears in today's O-D to the National Investigating Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). A private body that thinks the Air Force isn't telling all it knows about UFOs.

"I don't really think it was a meteor," Dana said today. "I'm more inclined to think it was a UFO than a meteor."

IT ALL STARTED last night when Dana, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Ralph DeGeorge of 1260 Greenview Drive, and his buddy, Vincent Fernia, 11, of 1969 Greene St., were working on their scrapbook of UFO newspaper clippings.

Both boys went to the astronomers and have geared their studies toward the skies.

Dana and Vincent went outside to hang around when "Vincent nudged me," Dana said, "look over there." Vincent recalled telling Dana, "It started to come in like a small star. Then it got green and traveled in a north-northwest direction, perhaps as big as a half-dollar."

"But I'm not qualified." Dana admitted. "I'm more inclined to think it was a UFO than a meteor."

IT ALL STARTED last night when Dana, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Ralph DeGeorge of 1200 Greenview Drive, and his buddy, Vincent Femia, 14, of 1609 Crouse St., were working on their scrapbook of UFO newspaper clippings.

Both boys want to be astronomers and have geared their studies toward science.

Dana and Vincent went outside to hang around when "Vincent studied me," Dana said.

Vincent said he saw the fireball pass roughly from south to north.

"It first started to come in like a small star. Then it got larger. It seemed like it was burning and traveling pretty fast," Vincent recalled. "It was greenish-blue, most on the greenish side." Vincent recalled.

Vincent supports Dana's stand that what they saw might be a UFO.

"I'm taking all points of view," Vincent said.

The boys said the fireball was in several longer than any meteors that they had seen before, and that the spectacle was reported over too widespread an area to be just a meteor.

"A meteor would have disappeared in a short time," Dana said.

SCIENTISTS, Air Force spokesmen and others explained the fireball as a meteor, a falling satellite or a bolide, a type of meteor that burns itself out more slowly.

The thousands who flooded police and newspaper switchboards, described it variously as a jet airplane crash, a fireball, or flying saucers.

Dr. Thomas G. Nicholson, chairman of the Hayden Planetarium, called the object an exceptionally bright meteor that let a multicolored, glowing vapor trail. He said it was probably 10,000 times brighter than the brightest star at night.

"One of the unusual things about it is that it appeared over a very wide area," Dr. Nicholson said.

Dr. Nicholson explained that similar meteors appear over day but aren't reported because "very little of the world actually is populated."

A 1959 report estimated that 200 million visible meteors zip into the earth's atmosphere every day. Most, however, are not nearly so bright as last night's fireball.

Dr. Fred L. Whipple, director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., said: "It was a fireball, a very bright meteor, probably seen at an angle of 75 to 59 degrees to the earth in the western sky, estimated that it weighed "perhaps several hundred pounds."

A spokesman for the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington said the object probably was not a man-made satellite, as some believed, because none was scheduled to re-enter the atmosphere at that time.

MOST REPORTS said the object turned from white to

DANA'S PHOTO — This is the picture of the meteor that Dana DeGeorge took last night with a 35mm camera. He used Plus-X film, black and white, at 1/25 second and f. 2.8 to 4. The Associated Press transmitted the picture nationally.

From and traveled in a northwesterly direction, perhaps as high as 40 to 50 miles above the earth. A path of fluorescent green, telling the observers it was a meteor, lasting about 10 minutes in some areas.

The fireball, estimated to be going about 35 miles a second, was reported to have exploded or disintegrated on the north horizon.

A. Russell Bleeker, electrical engineer, 3 Norris Drive, Whitesboro, said he and his son, Don, 15, saw the object break up "within 50 miles." The father said, "I'm sure it wasn't a meteorite. It was too low with too flat a trajectory." He estimated its altitude at 1,000 to 5,000 feet.

Russell said it might have been some "space hardware" reverting the atmosphere.

Another observer was Deborah Jones, 14, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Jones, Morgan Road, Marcy, who saw the "bright light" of the fireball through window curtains and watched it "explode" and leave a trail of sparks.

A Griffiss Air Force Base spokesman said it definitely was not a plane. "It was either a meteor or a satellite re-entering the atmosphere and burning up as it did."

Among the earth last night to Utica newspapers were residents who described the fireball as "sheer beauty . . . beautiful gorgeous . . . magnificent."

ANOTHER CALLER was Dana, who told a jubilant news staff he had snapped the fireball's picture.

Dana, a photographer about two years, was brought to the newspaper where technicians developed the picture. The picture then was sent nationwide by the AP.

Dana, who came to work on the few known shots of the fireball, said he was "lucky."

Dana left the Utica newspapers' office about 11 and stayed up a while telling his parents and about some of the night.

About 1 a.m., a New York Times reporter phoned the boy for his account of the "meteor" and how he got the snapshot.

"He congratulated me and told me it was for a Page One story," Dana said. "I couldn't sleep after that."

Whatever the fireball was — a meteor's dying farewell, a satellite's unscheduled trip back to earth or forbidding UFOS, Dana said he's sending in his membership application Friday to UFO organization, NICAP.

Syracuse-Herald-Journal -- 26 Ap 66

Sparkler in the sky called meteor

By ROBIN PEARLBERG

"It was just gorgeous . . . a huge sparkler moving across the sky."

This was just one of scores of calls that flooded the Herald-Journal switchboard between 8:15 and 9:30 last night. The calls stated describing in after thousands of Syracusans, like others in northeastern states, witnessed the dazzling celestial phenomenon which immediately set off a mass display of wonderment.

Scientists said it was probably a tiny meteor, disintegrating as it entered the atmosphere on a plunge from the Carolinas to Canada and as far inland as Ohio, the celestial object thrilled and astonished thousands as it soared across the sky with a bright multi-colored vapor trail in view for several seconds.

Police, weather bureau and aviation agencies, were deluged with reports that varied in description and in interpretation which ranged from a glowing spaceship to a plane on fire.

But most sources came to the conclusion as Dr. Fred L. Whipple of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass. He said: "On the basis of information I now have I would have to say it was a meteor that must have been smaller than a football."

"It was probably one meteor that started to break up, and it was all in the same trajectory."

I could not make out the next few words clearly.

At times both of this newspaper's telephones were completely jammed all lines. And it was the same at the police department, sheriff's office, Hancock Field and State Police offices.

The reaction ranged from fear to amazement, from curiosity to speculation.

In general, Syracuse area residents were in agreement as to the fiery object that appeared to be light green and then fade into an orange color as it traveled behind the object.

Also was reported by most persons who saw it.

Thousands Here See It

Flying Object Was Meteor, Officials Agree
(Continued from Page One)

"We must have had at least 50 calls, all within a few minutes," Frantic Operator said.

Each caller was very upset, making known what he had seen, Mrs. Oslow said.

"They all proceeded that reports were something like - Honest - you may think I'm crazy - but I'm not," she said.

Pie-Shaped
"Most reported that it was greenish-blue-green in color and triangular or pie-shaped," she added.

Sent to investigate the first call was Patrolman Robert Hickman.

"When I got to his home," Mr. Millville walked into the yard holding his hands up in the air, saying "Officer, I'm not a drinking!"

Mr. Smyrnes was a licensed pilot who said he has seen many meteorites and fire balls since his World War II flying days.

"But I never saw anything like this - it was a meteor," said Mr. Smyrnes.

Light On Horizon
He said he was facing Keesport when he noticed a light on the horizon. "It was bright for three to five seconds and at times looked like two objects. It was brilliant."

"It was coming down in a 16 degree pattern like a meteorite would, but its shape was not that of any thing I've ever seen before," Mr. Smyrnes said he was skeptical. "I've got a good family - skeptical. But now I'm a believer - I just saw a 'UFO'!" (Hickman reported)

First Seen It
Another spotter was Mr. Smyrnes, 40, a laundry operator, who lives at 211 Thomas Dr., North Huntingdon Twp., some 10 miles southeast of McKeesport.

Light On Horizon
Mr. Smyrnes is a licensed pilot who said he has seen many meteorites and fire balls since his World War II flying days.

The Pittsburgh Press, Tuesday, April 26, 1966

Officials Agree
"This was traveling at about five times the rate of speed of any plane on a landing approach - I would say it was in the supersonic range," he said.

Many residents in the Elizabeth Twp. area got the impression that the object was landing in the vicinity of the Youghiogheny River.

The closest reported observation was made by two West Elizabeth youths, Thomas McKeesport, 18, and Michael Pluchak, 17.

Oblong Shape
They said they were seeing from a large area in the Monongahela River in West Elizabeth, when they spotted it coming from the south.

Both said the object was "taking in shape-compare it to a DOG saucer."

CALLED METEORITE
Utica Daily Press - 26 Apr 66

Fiery Ball Seen In Utica Skies

Shades of Orson Wells' Invasion by Martians hit the eastern seaboard and midwest yesterday last night when thousands of persons saw a greenish-blue ball and "color-wise vapor trail" formed by one super-spectacular...

It all began at about 8:15.

Most excited was 14-year-old Dana DeGeorge of 1200 Greenview Drive, who with his 35mm camera quickly photographed the object from his backyard. (See above).

DeGeorge, who with friend, Vincent Semla, 14, of 1600 Crouse St., has quickly studied UFO's, (unidentified flying objects), and said "We have, believe it or not, photographed it with a camera."

The two Proctor High School pupils were brought to the newspaper office by a reporter while calls continued to flood the five general-news lines of the Press.

Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) authorities at about 10:45 said the object, definitely identified by officials as a meteor, landed in New Haven, Conn.

The director of the Smithsonian Observatory, Cambridge, Mass., said "that it was definitely a meteor that had gone into the earth's orbit."

"That's the story of last night's light in the sky," the director said.

Dr. Thomas D. Nicholson, chairman of the Hayden Planetarium, said the fireball was exceptionally bright meteor, probably 10,000 times brighter than the sky's brightest star.

"I would estimate the magnitude to be minus 10 to minus 12 which would mean it was at least 100 times brighter than Venus, when the planet is at its greatest brilliance," he said.

A spokesman at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. said the event was unexpected and the observatory did not have any tracking equipment turned on.

Paul Patterson of the Yale University Observatory said the object could have been a "bolide" which enters the atmosphere at a slow speed and therefore burns itself out more slowly.

A bolide seems to travel at a level altitude, he said. But the small, "double the size of a beach ball" object, caused more excitement here than recent UFO sightings.

A. Griffiss Air Force Base spokesman said it definitely was not a plane. "It was either entering the atmosphere and burning up or it could have been seen for a radius of (Continued on Page 5)

'UFO May Be
Huge Meteorite'

ONEIDA — One of the largest meteorites to cross Central New York skies in recent years may have landed somewhere in the Adirondacks.

The sky show set telephone wires at state police, Troop B Oneida Police Station, and many other police agencies ringing. Sgt. Bruce Payne of Troop D received 25 calls about the fireball. It was first reported to state police by Air Force switchboard and many other police agencies ringing.

The last call was from North of Tabor. Police at New Hartford, State Police at New Hartford, and station WKTV at Utica checked with the Air Force at Griffiss AFB and were told the fire ball was a meteorite burning out in a south to north course.

It appeared to have a more flat trajectory than the usual meteorite.

At Oneida Police Station, Lt. Edward Yenian received more than 15 telephone calls. The meteor was described as an object of orange and blue fire.

Police here believe the flying object was an unusually large meteorite.

Flaming Meteors, Yes
Rhode Islanders
Tell UFO Tale
By VINCENT G. MOLONEY

A meteor that flashed A meteor that dashed the eastern seaboard last night was an object less seen in how unidentified flying objects are created.

Since the student had been able to gain admittance to Brown, Professor Smiley felt rather skeptical of some he was dealing with a rational observer. He thereupon conducted a scientific inquiry.

The first sighting in Rhode Island apparently took place about 8:12 p.m. Minutes later the two Providence Journal-Bulletin city desk staffers saw it.

Said Professor Smiley, "The said he saw a very small red object move across the sky, stopping from time to time. It was very bright but tiny."

"I asked him how close this was to a research center."

All of the callers were excited and all described something similar.

The object they had seen was variously described as green, bright red, flashing red, flashing white, and a yard about two inches in diameter.

It turned out there were one nearby. What he had seen was a laser being used in an experiment. It is a strong beam of light and very thin.

But you need force or fast motion to see it. So the astronomer asked for it to be seen. If it had been clear, he wouldn't have picked it up. All the conditions added up to a logical explanation when checked out.

Professor Smiley smiled the smile which only men who have demolished a flying saucer smile.

"As a scientist I'm inclined to say there has been no evidence they come from anywhere outside the earth," he asserted. "All I've seen and heard about are natural phenomena not understood by the public."

Blame for the continued sightings was placed by the astronomer in a lot of places—press and TV publicity and the human desire for recognition.

"Flying saucers give a person a lot of ego," he said.

Saucers

And others saw it crash into the Scituate Reservoir or into a pond in Attleboro.

Even after the Air Force well-known astronomers had telephoned the object as a meteor, the callers remained skeptical. "That was no meteor," said a woman from Warwick. "I've seen a lot of meteors." I wonder what the Russians are up to."

A Cranston woman declared she saw an object she saw in the sky a "a ship of some kind made of metal or something."

"It is up and disintegrated in a puff of smoke," she reported. "The event went on, while the middle section fell down somewhere near Scituate."

Dr. Charles H. Smiley, Brown University astronomer, said the meteor was a natural phenomenon, on the basis of descrip-

Flying Saucers? No

Prof. Smiley Doubts
The Eerie Stories
By GEORGE POPKIN

Sidelined flying saucers
covered the earth as Dr.
Charles H. Smiley, Brown
University astronomer kept
talking the strangest tale of
our times.

Namely, the theory that intelligence life from outer space
is slipping about our planet
usually in oval shaped objects
with blinking lights.

For a gentle and cultivated
man, the director of Ladd Observatory is a "Tantalizing
scientist" when it comes to destroying what he feels are delusions.

A Rhode Island boy
whose scientific curiosity
had been a flying saucer
and that one of the people in
it had spoken to him.

Professor Smiley asked
whether the visitor spoke
English. When he realized
this was so, the astronomer

remarked, "Well, he's not
from Venus—or English is
spoken there."

A student told him in class
that he had sighted a flying
saucer.

Since the student had been
able to gain admittance to
Brown, Professor Smiley felt
obliged to assume he was
dealing with a rational observer. He thereupon conducted a scientific inquiry.
Said Professor Smiley, "If
you saw a very small red
object move across the sky,
stopping from time to time.
It was very bright but tiny."

"I added him how close
the was to a research center."

It turned out there was one
nearby. What he had seen
was a laser light used in an
experiment. It is a strong
beam of light and very thin.
But you need clouds of dust

for it to be seen. If it had

been clear, he wouldn't have
picked it up. All the conditions added up to a logical
explanation when checked
out."

Professor Smiley smiled the
smile with which only men who
have demolished a flying
saucer smile.

"As a scientist I'm inclined
to say there has been no
evidence they come from anywhere outside the earth," he
asserted. "All I've seen and
heard about are natural
phenomena not understood by
the public."

Regarding where the meteor might have crashed, the astronomer asserted it is very common for people to think a meteor falls a lot closer than it actually does.

The first call at the Journal-Bulletin, ironically, was "I'd like to report an object that I just saw headed from south to north over the East Side. It was green, had a long vapor trail and appeared to be a meteor. I'm calling from Benefit Street." Three adults saw it.

The next few calls said about the same thing. Then they got wilder.

"Hello, I'm in Warwick Neck and I just saw a flying saucer headed toward Providence. There were two planes chasing it."

"I saw the fastest helicopter I've ever saw. You better call the Navy and find out what they are doing."

"I'm calling from Settante and told that customers at a restaurant there had seen the object, crash into the reservoir." Informed that the object had been seen in Syracuse, NY, and in Maryland, she said, "Well, you better call the restaurant. They saw it go down."

About 8:30, the Weather Bureau had confirmed that the object was a meteor, and the city offered had its normal fare for the callers. But they refused to believe it.

Seeing the unseeable,
Dr. Charles H. Smiley
—Journal-Bulletin Photo

"It's nice to see things in the sky. California has a lot of tests and they see all sorts of things."

Professor Smiley said visitors from intelligent beings from outer space cannot be scientific. "We are not very scientific about our thoughts on the subject."

"We expect such people to be something like us," he said. "They might be tiny, very tiny. Maybe we ought to look for them under a microscope or in bacteria. Perhaps some of them are around here now, under our noses, small as a molecule."

The tremendous distances from which these visitors would come, the metallurgy and the intelligence needed would require such trips to take time. Wide imagination had been flung open and Professor Smiley was on a track dear to his heart.

"It is a very rare and limited property of human imagination to think that it is most important to scientific inquiry and discovery. You can't discover something impossible to imagine, usually."

The astronomer let imagination run wild. He spoke of the possibility of space communications. He had done a little figuring, talking telephone company rates for distance calls to a base somewhere in outer space, and to get the reply.

"Things have changed," he commented. "When I suggested space travel I was practically laughed out of college. I was almost thrown out. I see now that I was too conservative. I said we'd reach the moon by the end of the century."

The picture accompanying was on the table, Professor Smiley took another look. On a clear day he can almost see through the unscalable. This is not difficult if you can think untraditionally. He praised the great achievements of our time will come from controlled nuclear reactors using inexpensive hydrogen. "But no such 'with us' hydrogen could be picked up everywhere."

The future so dazzled the astronomer that he unconsciously shaded his eyes against the wan New England spring light seeping through the windows of Richardson Hall.

"No one will have to fight over water," the astronomer mused, "There will be fresh water everywhere." Civilization won't be worried. Oil will be a cheap supply of cheap nuclear energy.

"Well, we'll have control of civilization."

One person reported seeing the
UFO land with "10 little green
men" getting out.

Only one man who gave the
"inhabitants of saucers"
from a man who refused to give
his name. He simply said,
"They're running all over my
backyard. Get the back out here
and chase them away."

Calls were received at police headquarters
between 8:15 and 9:30. Police
said observers were calm, collected, observing, standing still,
moving slowly and streaking at
ultra-sonic speed.

Among those who reported
seeing the object was John Morgia's
son, who asked his father to
come out of their home and
"see the largest, brightest
flying star of all time."

Several persons in the Central
New York area who reported
the object last night also said
they saw a UFO Sunday evening.

John Povero, veteran pilot
of a school bus driver in
Seneca Falls, said he saw a
UFO early Sunday evening in
South Seneca County. "It just
seemed to burn itself out," he
said.

Bright Object in Sky Startles Area People

A bright green light in the sky, which started soon after 7 p.m. last evening, was reported seen over much of the northeastern United States.

A spokesman at Griffiss Air Force Base said after checking with officials of the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) the bright object was determined to be a meteorite burning up in the Earth's atmosphere.

Scores of phone calls poured into police and newspaper switchboards on the celestial sighting.

Mr. and Mrs. Francis Everitt, 168 Main St., Whitesboro, said they saw "a bright green object" with sparks of fire shooting out the back" as it was moving on Route 5N between Barneveld and Prospect, shortly after 7 p.m. "It just disintegrated in the sky—whoosh," Mrs. Ervin Everitt said.

THE GAFB spokesman commonly known as "shooting stars," disappear as quickly as they are spotted in the Earth's atmosphere.

Herkimer station said their phones were ringing constantly last night on the sighting. A person who identified himself as a high school science teacher told troopers he saw the object as a meteorite.

The Associated Press Albany bureau reported that state and local police from Essex County to near the Vermont-Canadian border to Wyoming County in Buffalo, reported masses of calls from persons reporting the bright object.

Many described it as a light blue or green in color, elliptical in shape, and moving rapidly in a northerly direction.

CURTIS L. HEMENWAY, director of the Dudley Observatory in Albany, said the descriptions led him to believe it was a meteorite.

Hemenway added, however, that "if I was an astronomer on Mars, when someone went by and someone called me to ask about it, I'd probably have given the same description."

Another spokesman at Dudley said it was "reasonable" that the same meteorite could have been seen in Albany and Buffalo simultaneously.

However, to compound the confusion in the sky, persons near Plattsburgh reported seeing a silvery object giving off blue and red flames as late as 8:45 p.m.

LEROY SEAMAN of 3 Park St., New Hartford, said he was on Erie Street, Utica, near the West End Seafood, Inc., shortly after 7 p.m., when "a bright green light, like a sky-rocket," suddenly appeared and disappeared. It was "high in the sky," Seaman added.

William C. White of Barneveld and James Brozinski of Utica, both said they spotted a "blue flash of light" shortly after 7 p.m.

However, Dana DiGeorge, 1200 Greenview Dr., and Robert DeRocco, 748 Blandina St., said they spotted "a rotating white light" moving west between 9 and 9:20 p.m.

LEE ABBOTT of Maynard Drive, Utica, said the light was seen shortly after 7 p.m. "It was bluish in color."

Sal Perritano of 744 Blandina St., said the bright light "revolved" and seemed to be red, white, and green.

Sighting shortly after 7 was also reported in St. Lawrence and Chenango counties.

Thousands See Meteor's Flight;
Authorities Besieged With Calls

Telephone tangled at Griffiss AFB, the Rome Police Station, and the Sheriff's Department last night after hundreds of residents saw seeing a fiery, greenish, ball-like object.

Scientists generally agreed to fly it was a meteor that flashed across the sky about 8:15 and excited thousands from the east.

A spokesman at Griffiss said the base received hundreds of calls between 8:20 and 11:30 from residents who had seen the fiery object in the sky and wondered what it was.

They were told that it was assumed a meteor - entering the earth's atmosphere.

The spokesman said the object did not trigger was a satellite - entering the atmosphere.

While there were many conflicting reports on the direction, most residents said it looked like general direction north to south.

Some said it also changed color and was greenish.

Busy Phone
The Rome Police Department received one period 12 calls about the object - in one period 12 calls were received in 10 minutes.

The Sheriff's Department estimated it had received 26 to 35 calls.

The Associated Press reported that Dr. Thomas C. Nicholson, chairman of the Hayden Planetarium, called the object that left a multicolored, glowing vapor trail. He said it was brighter than the brightest meteor and more brilliant than the brightest star west of Toronto and as far west as the Carolinas.

Sensation
The object touched off a sensation at the height of its journey as thousands scurried for telephones. Some of the callers seemed excited while others appeared frightened.

Police switchboards in dozens of communities were swamped with reports of a jet airplane crash and flying saucers.

While there were no reports that the object or parts of it had landed, most astronomers believe it probably disintegrated during its flight. There was no clear agreement on the size of the object.

But Dr. Neil Blarney, director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., said: "It was a meteor which must have been more than 10 miles in diameter."

A spokesman for the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington said the object was probably some believed, because none was scheduled to re-enter the atmosphere.

Some scientists speculated a bolide, which is a type of meteor that burns itself out more slowly than other meteors as it enters the atmosphere and often breaks up into fragments of its trajectory.

The object prompted hundreds of calls to police, news media and Air Force installations.

At Pittsburgh Air Force Base, a spokesman said no aircraft were in difficulty and added: "If one was flying that fast, it sure would be in trouble."

traveling from right to left across the sky as a looming ball of fire with a corkscrew tail. Dan, De George, a high school freshman, took this picture from his front yard. "I looked like a ball that you'd put gasoline on and lit," he said. "And it appeared to break in two just before it went out of sight." Astronomers, he noted, that the meteor might have been as large as a suitcase and weighed as much as several hundred pounds.

SPRINGFIELD, MASS.

George Gambino, a cameraman for Station WWLP-TV, was returning from an assignment when he spotted a brilliant light streaking between the buildings of downtown Springfield and shot these pictures. First (above) the meteor looked like a fiery sphere with a twisted tail a few seconds later (right) it appeared to flicker and disintegrate into beads of light. Springfield, like New York City, was east of the meteor's path, hence the meteor traveled from left to right across the heavens.

NEW YORK CITY
Thousands of people across the northeastern U.S. were dazzled last week by a spectacularly bright object—which most authorities pronounced a meteor—that was seen at sunset along a 1,000-mile path from the Carolinas to Canada. In New York 19-year-old William Copeland, a college freshman and an amateur photographer, was prowling along the Brooklyn waterfront and caught the luminous meteor plummeting toward earth, its silvery trail etched against the orangey sky over lower Manhattan.

Utica was west of the meteor's path and more observers there saw it traveling from right to left across the sky as a lowering ball of fire with a corkscrew trail. Dana DeGeorge, a high school freshman, took this picture from his front yard. "It looked like a ball that you'd put passing on and fire," he said. "And it appeared to break in two just before it went out of sight." Astronomers guessed that the meteor might have been as large as a suitcase and weighed as much as several hundred pounds.
