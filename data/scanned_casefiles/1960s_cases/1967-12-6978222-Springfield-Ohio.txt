UFO Observation, 8 December 1967

Springfield Police Department
Springfield, Ohio 45501

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Springfield, Ohio, which occurred on 8 December 1967 at approximately 1135 pm.

2. Observers sighted a large, bright, orange, circular self-luminous object and another object, similar but smaller and below it, and seemingly attached to the upper one. The object was observed for approximately two minutes. The description is consistent with those we have received in the past of hot-air, garnet-bag balloon observations.

3. Did you receive any reports of unusual objects for this date? Has there been any hot-air balloon activity in the area that you know of? We would appreciate your comments as to a possible cause for this sighting.

4. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.
