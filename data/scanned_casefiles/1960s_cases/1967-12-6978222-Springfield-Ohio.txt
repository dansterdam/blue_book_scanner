The object appeared as a luminous oval shape, banded, and changing in appearance. It seemed to float and glide slowly, with no sound detected. The object did not reflect light but appeared self-luminous, with a dim reddish glow. Its size appeared to be about the diameter of a basketball held at arm's length. The object's motion appeared controlled and purposeful, not erratic. It seemed to be an intelligently controlled craft, rather than a "natural" phenomenon.

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
Brightness of the object oval colored
seemed to attract our attention as
startlingly intense an initial impression.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
The object oval vanished slowly while
the "segmented rays" then faded very
slowly, and no noise was described. The
sighting then ended abruptly as it was
observed in a clear night sky.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
[NO] NOT DESCRIBED.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch showing the shape of a phenomenon that the observer is describing. The sketch depicts an object with two elongated shapes, possibly representing a UFO or other aerial phenomenon. There are also some handwritten notes that describe the size and movement of the observed object.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

15. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon. Include and label any details that might have appeared at various positions, or which might indicate the direction the phenomenon was moving.

16. What was the angular size? Hold a match at arms length in front of a known object, such as a street light or barn, and estimate the approximate size of the object. This will give an indication of the size of the phenomenon at the time it was observed. The size it would have been covered by the match head.
