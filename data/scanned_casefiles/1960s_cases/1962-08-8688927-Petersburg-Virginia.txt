I was relaxing on my side porch just gazing into the western sky when I noticed that a star was moving toward me. I immediately summoned my wife to take a look at the satellite. (That's what I thought it was at first) we then all went into the front yard for a better look. At this point it appeared to be moving too fast for known satellites. When nearly over head it oddly appeared to wobble & sway from side to side as though it were going out of control. Before doing this, it appeared to almost stop. IT then resumed speed and continued on a straight course. At the time I got the impression of a space craft that had slowed below orbital speed and was having some trouble staying upright. As it went into the southeast it became fainter and fainter. I couldn't see it. IT gave off a bluish white light and appeared to eclipse some of the stars while traveling near. No sound was heard then or later. I did not see it again that night or on following nights.

I retuned my actions to get a better idea of the viewing time. Four to five minutes seems about right for the U.F.O. to have moved across 2/3 of the sky.

Dear Sirs:

On the night of 8/7/62 at about 7:30, I was gazing into the sky from my side porch when I noticed about a star progressing slowly to S.E. When near to S.E. its magnitude intensity was about first or 2nd to 4th. IT gave off a steadily unpulsating light gradually becoming dimmer as it went into the S.E. Over head it appeared to almost stop then resume speed with a wobbling movement. Then resume speed, three or four minutes. The flight lasted, such as it was, about two or three hours.

No sound was audible then or such has late. I called my wife's mother at that time. This U.F.O. was in the sky. As I have no witnesses, it was no type of confirmation. I was gently appreciating this or theories on this sighting.

Sincerely,
