Text from the document:

On 29 Aug 69 at approx 1900 PST a source reported that he observed a bright red-orange light in the SE sky, the light appeared to be moving in an erratic pattern, hovering and then darting around rapidly. The light was observed for approx 2 min and then disappeared. The source stated that the light was of sufficient brightness to see the outline of mountains against the sky. The event was reported to have occurred approximately 10 miles NW of San Francisco, California.

The image contains a diagram showing the observed movement of an unidentified phenomenon. The diagram appears to be a sketch or drawing made by the observer, depicting the path and trajectory of the object as it was seen. There is no photograph present in this document.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a phenomenon when first observed. The second sketch contains two landscape drawings, one larger and one smaller, showing a person standing in a hilly or mountainous landscape.

Text extracted from the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "U" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A DOT AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. A LINE DRAWN BETWEEN THE TWO DOTS WILL SHOW THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF TRAVEL OF THE PHENOMENON. IF THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
