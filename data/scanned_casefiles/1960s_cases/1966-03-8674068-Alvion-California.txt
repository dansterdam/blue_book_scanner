The text in the document is as follows:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 23/06/66  2325/0630Z
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Four
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3.5 hours
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: Stationary
8. PHOTOS: Photos, possible lightning
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Possible lighthouses

The brief summary and analysis states that the colors of the objects were white, tinged with red and green, and their movements were erratic but generally remained in the same position. All movements were sporadic but generally remained in the same positions 25 and 30 degrees. Photo analysis could not definitely identify the objects, but it was believed that they could be that of a lighthouse.

This image contains a photograph analysis report from Project Blue Book related to "Unidentified Flying Objects" observed in Pt. Cabrillo, California on March 23, 1966. The report indicates that two color slides were provided as part of the photography, but the quality is described as "Poor". The analysis concludes that the exact nature of the imagery could not be determined, but the main group of lights suggest a "tower-like" configuration which may have been emanating from an attached building. The report is signed by Thomas E. Davis, Intelligence Research Specialist, and Wilber Price, Jr., Chief of the Photo Exploitation Division.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR: 66-49
DATE OF REPORT: 23 NOV 66
SUBJECT: "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS"
LOCATION: PT. CABRILLO, CALIFORNIA
DATE: 23 MAR 66
PHOTOGRAPHY: AF F NRS: TWO COLOR SLIDES
QUALITY: POOR
1. PURPOSE: This is in response to Work Order Number 66-35 submitted by Major Quintanilla, TDEW/UFO. Message concerning conditions and sighting was examined and subject photography was analyzed.
2. ANALYSIS: Although the exact nature of the imagery could not be determined, it is believed that it could be that of a lighthouse. The photography was accomplished in the dark hours between 0630 Z and 1000 Z time. The main group of lights suggest a "tower-like" configuration which could be a lighthouse at Pt. Cabrillo. The light which is adjacent to the "tower" could be one which was being emanated from an attached building at it's base.

1. Reference the unidentified flying object observed on 23 March 1966. His slides and prints are contained in CDCL. Requests that you forward these to him.
2. Although the exact nature of the imagery could not be determined, it is believed that it could be that of a lighthouse. The photography will complete the imagery because 100% and 100% of the image elements which could be a lighthouse at Pt. Cabrillo. The light which is adjacent to the "tower" could be one which was being illuminated from an attached building at its base.
3. The information, color, comments, duration, etc., are consistent with that of an astronomical observation. A study of the information submitted leads to the conclusion that astronomical bodies were responsible for the sightings.
