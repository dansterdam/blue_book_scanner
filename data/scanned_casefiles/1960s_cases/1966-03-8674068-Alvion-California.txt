1. DATE/TIME GROUP: 23 Mar 66 23/0630Z
2. LOCATION: Alvion, California multiple
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Four
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3½ hours
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: Stationary
8. PHOTOS: ☒ Yes ☐ No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: ☐ Yes ☒ No
10. CONCLUSION: Astro(S/F) PHOTOS: Possible lighthouse
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:

The colors of the objects were white, tinged with red and green. All were bright lights no definite object was seen. All movements were erratic but generally remained in the same position. All of the lights were at an elevation of between 25 and 30 degrees.

First three objects probably were the stars Sirius/250 deg. at 10 deg. Az./; Capella (310 deg. Az. 26 deg. el.) and Arcturus which was at 110 deg. Az. 55 deg. el.

Photo analysis could not definitely identify the image, but believed that it could be that of a lighthouse.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 66-49
PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 23 Nov 66

SUBJECT "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS"
LOCATION PT. CABRILLO, CALIFORNIA DATE 23 Mar 66

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF IR QUALITY Poor
P NRS Two Color Slides

1. PURPOSE: This is in response to Work Order Number 66-35 submitted by Major Quintanilla, TDEW/UFO. Message concerning conditions and sighting was examined and subject photography was analyzed in an attempt to identify the objects reported.

2. ANALYSIS: Although the exact nature of the imagery could not be determined, it is believed that it could be that of a lighthouse. The photography was accomplished in the dark hours between 0630 Z and 1000 Z time. The main group of lights suggest a "tower-like" configuration which could be a lighthouse at Pt. Cabrillo. The light which is adjacent to the "tower" could be one which was being emanated from an attached building at its base.

UFO Observation, 23 March 1966

78th Combat Support Group

1.  Reference the unidentified observation of Engineman Fullenwider of the U.S. Coast Guard on 23 March 1966.  His slides and prints are contained in attachment one.  Request that you forward these to him.

2.  Although the exact nature of the imagery could not be determined, it is believed that it could be that of a lighthouse.  The photography was accomplished in the dark hours between 0630 and 1000Z time.  The main group of lights suggest a "tower-like" configuration which could be a lighthouse at Pt. Cabrillo.  The light which is adjacent to the "tower" could be one which was being emanated from an attached building at its base.

3.  The description, colors, movements, duration, etc., are consistent with that of an astronomical observation.  A study of the information submitted leads to the conclusion that astronomical bodies were responsible for the sighting.
