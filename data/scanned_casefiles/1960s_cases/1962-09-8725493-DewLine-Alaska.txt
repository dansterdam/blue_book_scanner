numerous people near Richmond, West Virginia, saw a weird triangle-
shaped UFO last September 26th. One of the witnesses was a private pilot
named Robert Kerns who was flying at 1,000 feet when his plane almost collided with
the object. He described it as a triangle about 12 feet tall that looked like
aluminum tubing. It had a light in each corner.

COVINGTON, VIRGINIA

Meteorite Search by Helicopter
First recorded use of a helicopter to look for a recently-fallen meteorite was scored by SAO's Dr. Richard McCloskey, with Dr. Frank Drake of West Virginia's Green Bank Observatory, last month. Mac was checking a Pittsburgh MW meteorite report when he heard that a meteorite had fallen during the night of 1 Sept. near Covington, Va. He called Drs. Drake and Mallows directing the search.

Two days (28-29 Sept) were used by Drake and 2 pilots alternated in flying over a 25-square-mile patch of beautiful autumn foliage. Helicoptering proved to be "like flying a bicycle - hard to balance." The seekers got stiff necks. The chopper scared livestock in this order of frightability: chickens, sheep, horses, cows, hogs. They saw several promising-looking black areas such as each of which, approached, "got up and jumped into a hole in near ground-hog fashion," and they found no meteorite. But Mac is hopeful about the future of the new search method. "I'd like to use it again," etc.

He is also optimistic about SAO's meteorite photography recovery program. In New Station, in News, MPRS recently by Doug Mailbox SAO's office June 1957, is quoted George Swope of San Francisco.

Sept 29, 1962-2120 Pn                                Two very
large fireballs were seen within a cou-
ple of minutes of each other by 2 obser-
vers.  A E McGrew Carduss and W-erte Mey-
er, of the WSIC, first saw a green-blue
fireball which traveled from a position
350 elev, 3 and about 200 off the ver-
tical.  It traveled to about 15° above
the horizon.  A piece flew off to them
and down, about 25°above the horizon W.  It
was 2 or 3 time Jupiter's diameter.  It
started as a yellow object and changed to
green-blue.  It had a long trail.  About
13 minutes later while outside the car,
Carduss saw the second and which started
at a position about 50 west off direct S,
and at a position 700 S.  This one was
yellow-orange in color and even larger
than the first one.  It seemed to be 3 x
Jupiter's diameter and 1/2 x Jupiter's
diameter in length.  It traveled approx-
imately 500 to a position near Polaris,
(North star).  Sparks were showering off to
the left or east side of it.  It passed
almost directly overhead, and Miss Meyer
also viewed it after hearing Carduss's ex-
planation.  It disappeared at that point.
Speculation that it might have been a rock-
ket on nearby was expressed.  Two woman
in Tallmadge verified this second sighting
in time and direction.  Duration of
No 1 - 5 secs......No 2 - 4-5 secs.

ASTRONOMY                Science News Letter for August 25, 1962

Saturn "Eclipsed" by Moon

The stars, Vega, Deneb and Altair form a bright triangle overhead and the three planets, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn add splendor to the September sky, James Stokley reports.

> ALTHOUGH SEPTEMBER evening brings a notable rise in their brilliant display of stars, the month this year brings three bright planets to give an unusual splendor.

Two of these, as well as the stars, can be seen on the accompanying maps. The maps depict the heavens as they appear about 10 p.m., your own "kind of standard time," at the first of September (add an hour for daylight saving time): about 9:00 p.m. at the middle of the month and 8:00 p.m. at the close.

Venus Brightest of Trio

Brightest of our planetary trio is Venus, which is visible low in the west soon after sundown—and long before any other star or planet appears. However, Venus sets about an hour earlier at the end of the month so it has disappeared by the time for which the maps are drawn.

On the astronomer's magnitude scale Venus now ranks at minus 4.1, which is about 100 times the brilliance of an average star.

The other two planets appear on the map of the southern sky. The brighter is Jupiter, toward the southeast, in the constellation Aquarius, the water carrier. Its magnitude is minus 2.4, about a fifth as bright as Venus, but still exceeding any other planet.

And toward the south, in Capricornus, the sea goat, is Saturn. Although this is the faintest of the three planets, it still outshines a typical first magnitude star. On Sept. 10 Saturn takes part in a rare phenomenon, when the moon passes in front of it—an occultation—and in the evening in the western part of the country, but in the far west it occurs before sunset, and will hardly be visible.

These planets, of course, are bodies like the earth, visible because of the sunlight they reflect. The other objects are stars, which are self-luminous. The planets appear fainter because it is so hot. And of these, the brightest is Vega, in Lyra, the lyre. It is high in the west, shown on the northern sky map.

Directly overhead you can see Cygnus, the swan, with the first magnitude star Deneb, now in the northern half of the sky, part in the southern. Below it, toward the southwest, stands Aquila, the eagle, with first magnitude Altair. These three stars—Vega, Deneb and Altair—form a large and conspicuous triangle in the sky, which helps to identify them.

will set before the sky is dark enough for it to be seen.

When the moon passes in front of the sun, we call it a solar eclipse. But the moon may also pass in front of a planet or a star—an occultation. Such events are not uncommon; there are plenty of stars along the moon's path in the sky, so every night a few are thus occulted.

Generally the moon occults Cygnus on the bright enough to be seen without the help of a telescope. An occultation of a very bright star is a much rarer event—and is an occultation of a planet.

However, the moon occults Saturn on the evening of Sept. 10, and it will be visible all over the United States and Canada. At least the moon will be above the horizon in the states and provinces it now covers. The moon will not yet have set.

This will make it impossible to observe without a telescope.

During September the moon moves around the sky from west to east. It takes 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes to complete its trip; this period is called the sidereal month. It takes a little less than an hour—about 55 minutes on the average—for the moon to advance its own diameter.

Thus, if the moon's diameter passes directly in front of the star, the occultation will last about an hour. If the star is only the edge of the moon occults the star or planet. Since the planets also are moving in the sky, a planetary occultation may last a little longer, or shorter time, depending on the relative motion.

SCIENCE FIELDS

DENTISTRY
Dish-Shaped Profile
Corrected by Surgery

▶ A DISH-SHAPED profile can now be safely corrected by surgery on either side of the lower jawbone.

Braces on the teeth when the facial skeleton is still developing can also improve this type of deformity, Dr. Kurt H. Thoma, professor of oral surgery, Boston University, says in the American Dental Association's journal.

The condition in which the middle section of the face is undeviatingly pulled in "false prognathism." True prognathism exists when the is abnormal profile of the lower jaw.

In false prognathism the nose is often subtle-shaped or the upper lip may be short while the lower lip projects. Most patients with cleft palate have this abnormality.

An old type of surgery lengthened the facial nerves because the jawbone was cut at the front end. This new procedure involves cutting completely through the ascending portions of the lower jawbone on each side, and moving back the front portion of the jaw. Fixes are drilled to hold the bones in place, and screws are used to hold the bones firmly until they grow back together in the new position. No teeth have to be sacrificed, and the scar becomes invisible after a few months.

The report appears in the September issue of the Journal of Oral Surgery, American Dental Association.

MEDICINE
Liver Cancer in Rats
From Tropical Plant

▶ LIVER CANCER in rats has been caused by feeding them untreated seeds of the cycad, a tropical plant found in Guam and elsewhere. These seeds, after processing, are commonly used for human food in many parts of world.

The research was done at the University of Domingo and Australia, where a campaign for its destruction has been inaugurated because of its paralyzing effect on cattle and sheep.

A study of cycad and other plants in Guam was begun by Dr. Leonard Kurland, chief of the Epidemiological Branch, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness, Bethesda, Md., to find out possible effects of these seeds on animals.

The high incidence in Guam of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the disease that killed Lou Gehrig, the famous American baseball player, pointed to the cycad.

Dr. Marjorie C. Whiting, nutritionist at

NIMDB, reported after repeated visits to Guam.

But Dr. Gert L. Lacquer, chief, Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases, also discovered unexpected cancerous changes in rats fed these seeds when he fed them to rats. High doses and seeds cause liver damage, cirrhosis, followed in a few instances by cancer of the liver with metastasis (spread) and in independent kidney tumors.

Collaborative work on the cycad is going on between the University of Wisconsin, the University of Hawaii and the University of New England, Armidale, New South Wales, Australia.

ENTOMOLOGY
Mosquito Repellent
Takes Breath Away

▶ TOWARD OFF pesky mosquitoes, don't breathe. This method may be a bit too drastic for the average person, but it will keep off those buzzing pests, Drs. R. H. Wright and F. E. Kellogg of the British Columbia Research Council, Vancouver, reported in Nature, 195:464, 1962.

By studying the mosquitoes' target as an air stream passing by warm, wet, dummies cast cold, wet targets 16 times more than warm, dry targets and 51 times more than warm, dry targets maintained fairly inactive.

The scientists found that currents formed by breath and body heat drew the blood-sucking insects to the target. Testing with repellents, they found that some of the most popular brands interfered in some way with detecting these currents. The reason remains a mystery.

TECHNOLOGY
USSR Three Years Behind
in Electronic Computers

▶ RUSSIA is at least three years behind the United States in electronic computers, Dr. J. Presper Eckert, of Sperry Rand Corp., said at the first International Computing Association Conference in Seattle.

Two years ago the Russians were five years behind, but the Eckert-Mauchly first big American computer (ENIAC) in 1946, told the Northwest Computing Association Conference in Seattle.

Where there are only 600 to 800 electronic computers in the USSR, there are 10,000 at work in the USA. Half of them capable of the big complex jobs. The Russian machines can deal only with more restricted and generally simpler problems.

ENTOMOLOGY
Separation of Sexes;
No Moth Togetherness

▶ OPPOSITE sexes seem to shun each other in the tiny night world of moths, Canadian entomologist has claimed in Ottawa, Canada.

After several years of following the night life of moths, he finds that males and females have different activity peaks.

Female moths, he says, actively fly about early in the night, while males reach their peak just before sunrise. Males detect females by following their chemical trail.

ND CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)                17 SEP 62.

Marysville, Washington

Low Flying Disc
In Washington

The "Whisky Ridge" area east of
Marysville, Washington, played host to
a disc-like object which was reported by
many residents in the summer of 1962,
and a reporter recently suggested that
Whisky Ridge be re-named "Disc Ridge"
if any more are seen. The most recent
object was shaped like a whale, dipped
down toward a field as though it were
going to land, then headed off into the
northwest. It made no noise, and traveled
at about the speed of a small aircraft.
The latter sighting was made by Mr.
and Mrs. Floyd Brooks on 17 September
1962.
