PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 21 September 1962
2. LOCATION: New Ling, Alaska
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1515, 21 Sep 62
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: No
6. DURATION: 10 seconds
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 seconds
8. RELIEF INFORMATION: Radar paints and visual station gave objects heading NNE. In bright sunlight 30 seconds then disappeared. Objects gave definite indication they were visible.  Not close enough for details, too far away, however, to be associated with weather-visual visibility conditions. Could not be pinned down further due to brevity of observation.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)  
26 September 1962  
Richwood, West Virginia

Numerous people near Richwood, West Virginia, saw a bright strange-shaped object that landed on 22 September 1962. The object had a light in each corner and was about 12 feet in diameter. It took off quickly.

Meteorite Search by Helicopter
First indication of a meteorite search by helicopter was around 1 April 1962 when some debris was reported by SAC's Dr. Hynek through Dr. Fred B. Wood on a flight from Covington, Va., to Pittsburgh, Pa. 
Blue is checking a Pittsburgh, N.W. meteorite report by an individual who reported that he thought he had fallen during the night.
No photo was obtained of the suspected meteorite patch.
The writer also went on a search flight on 17 April 1962 with Capt. Saul from Edwards AFB and Drake and found no evidence of a meteorite, although a 15-lbs. sample of black and brown debris was collected. 
This series of frightening incidents in which the Air Force and other agencies are expending considerable time and effort investigating suspected meteorites, many of which turn out to be natural phenomena, demonstrates the highly unstable state of the public's idea concerning phenomena involving the sky. Reliable and responsible sources of information are urgently needed to clarify the situation and prevent needless expenditure of manpower and funds.

Twinsburg, Ohio - 3 miles west on Rte 82.
Two "pulsing" lights were seen within a short distance of each other, by 2 reliable observers for a period of about 5 minutes. The first sighting occurred from a position across the field - the second from a position near the PAFB first sighting. The object appeared to be disc-like and was estimated to measure about 15 feet in diameter. It was hovering and maintained a fairly steady altitude of about 25-300 feet above the horizon. The object then began to increase in brightness and size and seemed to be approaching directly overhead, estimated to be almost directly overhead, and was estimated to be about 75-100 feet in diameter at this time. Speculation that it might have been some kind of aircraft or missile on test, but the time and direction seemed to rule out such possibilities. Duration of sighting 2 - 2.5 minutes.

This document does not appear to contain any photographs. The text describes a sighting of objects that were not flying in any definite formation, and states that the objects were not close enough to be identified visually as aircraft. It also discusses the use of Doppler radar to analyze the situation, and mentions an FCC employee who witnessed the event. The text does not identify any individuals by name.

The image contains a black and white photograph of a star chart or celestial map. The map depicts the positions of various celestial bodies, including the planets Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. The text accompanying the image discusses the current visibility and positioning of these planets in the night sky.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR AUGUST 25, 1962

SATURN "ECLIPSED" BY MOON

Several celestial objects are visible overhead, including the three planets Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. These planets appear to be aligning in the sky. The text discusses how Saturn is currently "eclipsed" by the Moon, meaning it is obscured or passing behind the Moon from the perspective of an observer on Earth. The article describes the current positions and visibility of the planets in the sky.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for AUGUST 25, 1962 

THE FIELDS

DISH-SHAPED PROFILE CONFIRMS BY SURGERY
Now, a dish-shaped profile can be corrected by surgery, says the American Dental Association.
Researchers in Boston, New York, and Indiana report the procedure is successful in improving the appearance and function of jaws whose rear teeth haven't fully erupted.
Dentists can mould the bones into a more normal shape through surgical steps while patients are under general anesthesia. This is believed to be the first time such a formal study has been made. The dish-shaped profile is caused by a short lower jaw and sinking in of the middle of the face. This makes the chin look pushed back and gives the face a concave appearance, the ADA says. 

BIOLOGY
Cancer Growth in Dark
WHERE the dark green color grows, there the cancer, too, will grow. A study made at the Boston University School of Medicine indicates that chlorophyll, a substance existing in plants, not only paints plants green but inhibits cancer growth.
As a result, chlorophyll content appears to be a measure of a plant's ability to resist cancer. Some plants naturally have a high chlorophyll content and are resistant to cancer. The findings hold true only for the dark-green parts of plants, however. Another factor, unknown, may also be responsible for the cancer-inhibiting property.
The findings, made by Dr. E. K. Andrews and Dr. O. C. Neish, seem to show that the dark green color in plants is an indication of their resistance to cancer. Some plants with little or no green color are found to be very susceptible to cancer.

MEDICINE
Separation of Sexes May Increase Togetherness
OPPOSITE sexes seem to show much better compatibility when kept strictly apart on intimate occasions, according to some observation made at the University of Victoria, B.C. Researchers there found that members of the same sex get along much better when kept apart from the other sex. For instance, boys show more agreeable social behavior when kept apart from girls, and girls when kept apart from boys.
This seems to show that the separation of sexes, on intimate occasions, may actually increase the tendency for the opposite sexes to get along better when they do meet. The findings have implications for the upbringing of children and for community planning.

PSYCHOLOGY
USSR Three Years Behind on Microelectronics
According to information published by Dr. Eugene Rabinowitch in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the USSR is now about 3 years behind the United States in microelectronics, the fast-growing field of minute electronic components. This represents a loss of ground from a decade ago, when the Soviets were believed to be about even with the U.S. in this area.
While the USSR has made continued progress, Dr. Rabinowitch says, the U.S. has been moving ahead more rapidly. This puts the Soviet Union, once a leader, now somewhat behind in this key technology. However, the Soviets have still managed to put together some remarkably compact apparatus, including the Soviet DF-2 robot and the Sputnik II satellite, which carry highly sophisticated electronics inside very small packages.

Low Flying Disc in Washington
The "Wispy Ridge" area east of Marysville, Washington, played host to a strange light in the sky which was observed by many residents in the summer of 1962. A similar but bigger object was seen later in the year. There may be more cases. The most persistent sightings were reported to have been made at low altitude, described as a disc-like shape and glowing. It made no noise and traveled slowly, giving the impression of being under control. More information on this case is being obtained.
