27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION OF SOMETHING:

Upon request, an amateur photographer in the group viewed the object through several photographic filters. He reported that through a blue filter, the color of the object changed slightly cutting the intensity of the red noticeably. Through a yellow filter, the intensity of the green light was diminished.

It was further requested that color photographs be taken of the object. Comments were made to the effect that it would not show up on film, but the request was restated, indicating that they should be forwarded to FTD, W-PAFB regardless. It was agreed by an unnamed party present at the sighting to take and forward the pictures.

The object appeared to be light itself. As distance and speed could not be determined, it was not estimated whether self-generated or reflected. Appeared to change in color, although not particularly regularly. Appeared red, blue, white, and green. Was described as star-like, in size and shape, except for color and apparent movement.

WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? (Check appropriate blocks.)
[Location options include: Outdoors, In Building, In Car, In Boat, In Airplane, Other]
[Business/Residential/City/Countryside/Airfield/Flying over city/Flying over open country options also listed]

A. IF YOU WERE IN A VEHICLE, COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING:
WHAT DIRECTION WERE YOU MOVING? [Directions: North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest]
HOW FAST WERE YOU MOVING? [No specific speed entered]
DID YOU STOP ANYTIME WHILE OBSERVING THE PHENOMENON? [No box checked]

EXPLAIN WHETHER SUCH MOVEMENT AFFECTS YOUR SKETCHES IN ITEMS 5 AND 6:
N/A

DESCRIBE TYPE OF VEHICLE YOU WERE IN AND TYPE OF ROAD, TERRAIN OR BODY OF WATER YOU TRAVERSED DURING THE SIGHTING:
N/A

HOW MUCH OTHER TRAFFIC WAS THERE?
N/A

DID YOU NOTICE ANY AIRPLANES? [Yes box checked]
The dormitory is located in the traffic pattern for the Memphis Airport. Several planes passed during the conversation, but to all observers the phenomenon bore no resemblance to known aircraft.

LENGTH OF TIME:
25 min by end of phone call
PTD SDO was on the phone with observer for 20 min

Dropped from 1000 high as would a leaf, floating on air currents. While the object was close to the horizon (partly obscured by trees) it was never really out of sight. It appeared as a light, about the size of a star, changing color (red, blue, white green). After approx 10 min it began to rise slightly. Observers could not estimate distance from them, and thus would not estimate speed of movement.

No special shape, other than about the size and shape of a normal star. Direction noted in Block 7.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HOLD WATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD CONTINUED OBSERVING THE OBJECT AFTER THE INITIAL SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

Test was made (or simulated: observer answered hastily, but positively) and the match would have completely covered the object.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
As described, it moved behind some trees as it lowered ("floated") to the horizon, but did not disappear behind them, due to the intense light it apparently gave off.

Original inquiry was directed to MILLINGTON Naval Air Station, who told the observer to phone FTD. The conversation was terminated when another observer found the address and phone of a near-by Air Base to whom a previous inquiry had been made. The letter stated that if any objects or phenomena were sighted in the future, the party should contact the 'trained UFO observer' at that installation for assistance.
