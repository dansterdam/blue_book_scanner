Note: On Feb 22 7th Fleet was at 21.18N 127.40E which is consistent with Fleet maneuvers.

11. COMMENTS
At 0910Z Echo was at about 40° N latitude 127° E (over Korea). At 0928z it had moved to the equator at 172° longitude (over Gilbert Islands). If the Fleet was at 37° N 144° W or off the E coast of Japan this would be a confirmed Echo sighting. However the Fleet was Korean to be in this area and object in the sighting is probably Echo.
