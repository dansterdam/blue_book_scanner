14. Did the object disappear while you were watching? If so, how?
MAY VERY BRIEFLY BECAME BLOCKED BY A GARAGE IN REAR OF HOUSE, OR I MIGHT HAVE HAD ANOTHER 5-10 SECONDS SIGHTING BEFORE THEY DISAPPEARED ON OTHER SIDE OF HILL.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of: BEING SO MUCH BIGGER AND NOT AS BRIGHT, THE ONLY OBJECTS I NOTICED BEING PASSED IN FRONT OF, WERE THE MANY STARS OUT THAT NIGHT.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: A LOW, THEN HIGH PITCHED CHIRPING NOISE, AT EAST INTERVALS.
b. Color: PALE WHITE AND DULL, ALMOST GREY LUMINOUS.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT HALF TO THREE-QUARTERS OF OBJECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED. (EACH OBJECT AT A TIME.)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

(Please Note)
I DID NOT NOTICE AND PROTRUSIONS OF ANY KIND, PERFECTLY SIMPLE FOOT BALL LIKE OVALS.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   22   MARCH   1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

BEING A RATIONAL PERSON, AND NOT GIVING IN TO HALLUCINATIONS, AT FIRST I HAD THOUGHT THAT THE NOISE ABOUT ME COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ELECTRICAL WIRES OVERHEAD GOING INTO THE GARAGE.
I'VE HEARD THAT WIRES WILL SING OR MAKE A NOISE IN VERY COLD AND CRISP WEATHER.
THE ONLY THING IS, THAT AS THE OBJECTS PASSED OVER AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE GARAGE, THE CHIRPING NOISE ALSO FADED AWAY, TOO.

THE SKY WAS VERY BLACK AND EACH STAR SEEMED LIKE VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS. THERE WERE NO CLOUDS AND I NOTICED THE ABSENCE OF THE MOON, AT MY LOCATION OF THE SIGHTING.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAW, BUT I'LL SURELY REMEMBER THAT NIGHT THE REST OF MY LIFE. THEY WERE QUITE UNIQUE.

THANK YOU,

TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE 1968

GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN                                      12 FEBRUARY 1967

Unidentified: Information given insufficient to establish
whether it was more likely that birds (possibly nocturnal white owls?),
or reflection on wires, or aircraft might have provided the original
stimulus. A one-witness case, and hardly worth further investigation.
