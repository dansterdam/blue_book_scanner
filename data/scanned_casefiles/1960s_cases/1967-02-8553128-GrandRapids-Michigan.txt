The image does not contain any photographs, only a sketch and text.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

They were heading in a north-easterly direction - in a very rigid pattern. More were gaining or losing on the other. There together and the fourth one off in the northwest part of sky to the left.

The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which includes a handwritten narrative describing a UFO sighting.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 22 MARCH 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questions or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
BEING A RATIONAL PERSON, AND NOT GIVEN TO HALLUCINATIONS, AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THE NOISE ABOUT ME COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ELECTRICAL WIRES OVER HEAD GOING INTO THE GARAGE. 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WILL SING OR MAKE A NOISE IN VERY COLD AND CRISP WEATHER.
THE OBJECT THAT I SAW AS I WALKED OUT AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE GARAGE, THE GLOWING NOISE ALSO FADED AWAY. TOO.
THE SKY WAS VERY BLACK AND EACH STAR SEEMED LIKE VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS. THERE WERE NO CLOUDS AND NOTICED THE ABSENCE OF THE MOON, AT MY LOCATION OF THE SIGHTING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAW, BUT I'LL SURELY REMEMBER THAT NIGHT THE REST OF MY LIFE. THEY WERE QUITE UNIQUE.
THANK YOU.

TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE 1968

GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN                                  12 FEBRUARY 1967
Unidentified: Information given insufficient to establish
whether it was more likely that birds (possibly nocturnal white owls?)
or reflection on water, or aircraft, might have provided the original
stimulus. A one-witness case, and hardly worth further investigation.

4 June 1967

It occurred at a small airport and the duration was only half minute. There were other potential witnesses. Since it occurred at night it is possible that there were other witnesses available. The case contains potential evidence, but it is possible that there were no other witnesses.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California
It was a witness, duration of sighting only 15 seconds.

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire
Nothing of interest. Sighting lasted a few seconds. No additional information.  

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, the other agency's report, the signing is obviously unidentified.

19. 12 February 1957, Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
I have only the card on this case, but judging from it, there seems to be a possibility that this concerns a sighting of low-flying birds reflecting light. The sighting lasted 4 to 6 seconds and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it classified.
