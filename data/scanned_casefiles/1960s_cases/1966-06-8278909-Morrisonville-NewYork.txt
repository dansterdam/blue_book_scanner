PAGE 4 RUEDMA1866 UNCLAS
BRANCH. COMMENTS: THE OUTSTANDING FACTS INCLUDE:
(1) THAY THE PLANET-SATURN WAS AT A SIMILAR AND
APPROXIMATELY ELEVATION AND AZIMUTH AS WAS THE OBJECT
SIGHTED; (2) THAT AS THE OBSERVER CLAIMED, THE OBJECT
DID NOT MOVE NOR PERFORM TACTICS, AND TWINKLED LIKE A
STAR, GIVING OFF A YELLOWISH GLOW; (3) IT IS WEKK
KNOW THAT SATURN IS NOTED FOR ITS SHINING YELLOWISH
LIGHT; (4) OBSERVER HEARD NO SOUND, NOR SAW A TAIL OR
TRAIL, NOR OTHER PROTUENCES; (5) WHEN OBJECT WAS
RECHECKED, AFTER 1/2 HOUR, IT WAS NOT THEN VISIBLE; AS
PLANET HAD MOVED INTO ITS NORMAL STARRY SKY;
ADDITIONALLY IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT A CLEAR NIGHT
WITH ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION CAPABILITIES WOULD MAKE
SATURN APPEAR LARGER AND IN GREATER MAGNITUDE THAN
NORMAL TO ANY OBSERVER. THUS THE FACTS IN ALL
PROBABILITY POINT TO THE OBJECT BEING THE PLANET
SATURN: L. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE--NONE.
