Dear [redacted]

This will reply to your letter in which you reported your mididentified observation of June or July 1966.

With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as maneuvers, flight characteristics, and duration of sightings are essential in a comprehensive evaluation. Had you reported your observation to the nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible.

The local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data.

The enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of interest to you.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear M[illegible]

President Johnson has asked that I reply to your recent letter concerning your unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings.

The Air Force has the responsibility of investigating UFO reports and evaluating whether such objects pose a threat to our national security. We have been investigating UFOs for nearly two decades and to date we have no tangible evidence which proves the existence and inter-planetary mobility of extraterrestrial life.

In our opinion, UFOs exist as misinterpretations of known natural phenomena or conventional objects.

However, we only investigate UFOs reported to us. I am enclosing PFD Form 164 which can be used in officially reporting a sighting to us. Since you state that you have not sighted this object since the advent of cold weather, perhaps with the coming of spring you will observe it again. If you should see it again, we would appreciate your filling out the enclosed form in its entirety and returning it to us. We could then evaluate your sighting. If we are unable to find a logical answer, then your case will be categorized UNIDENTIFIED.

As requested, I am mailing this letter to your office address. Rest assured that the Air Force takes every precaution to protect those who request it from undue (and unwanted) publicity.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:

I am sorry I am not a better artist. The attached drawing is a crude replica of the most beautiful morning scene I have ever witnessed.

The moon like a brilliant silvery scimitar clove to a bowling ball of pure ebony. Venus, never lovelier, was as pretty as a newly crowned beauty queen. Strange, but the path of Surveyor 9 was clearly visible, numerous wintery black clouds streaked the western sky. Facing the south, I could feel ever so gently the coming sun on my left cheek, but the chilly bite of winter on my right cheek.

I was wondering if perhaps you had any reports from stationary meteorologists witnessing a similar phenomenon. I saw this at about 4:27 AM on June 15th.

Yours very truly,
Esoterist-Natural Science.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Four students from Stanford University's overseas campus in Florence had one to Italy for our vacation. It was our first night out - we were staying in the hotel of a back emphitheatre high in the mountains at Siena. The elevation is approximately 350 meters.

I lay extended. The horizon in the east was becoming light and reddish. I woke up. There was a noise in the bushes at the edge of the amphitheatre and I sat up to see what it was. I turned to look up into the sky and saw turning strange form. It was less bright than a star but lower and more substantial. It seemed to be moving. I said I didn't think so. She lay back calm. I continued watching the view. Suddenly it began to pulsate, growing all at once larger, then smaller, then again large. It was out of full moon. Then it instantaneously exploded into a large ball of fire which was green. It was not circular in shape but was oval. It radiated no sound. The explosion seemed to fade slowly. And then another orange event occurred. I saw it pulsate. I remember similar but out of the same light or perhaps thirty second interval. Briefly said.

All four clouds slow faded (in perhaps 3 minutes) into light white glow. The one passed far to the left towards falling into some other mass.

Now the fourth cloud cleared, leaving what I believed some one or real small spot which if I cannot recall this.

Notes for the substance of this report were made not more than four after the event, on June 19, 1966.

Gentlemen,

First of all I don't think I am sending this letter to the proper office but I have no addresses with me. Therefore, if you cannot help me, please refer this letter to someone who can.

I am presently studying at the Florence campus of Stanford University. We terminated our first quarter of study on June 16 and began a three week recess. Four of us went to Sicily. On our first night in Sicily we observed a very curious phenomenon for which I would like an explanation.

We were camped for the night of June 18 at Selinunte, the site of the ancient temples east of Palermo. I had awakened. The horizon in the east was just becoming light and pale. I awoke because the sun asked me to wake her to see sunrise. Then I lay down to try to go back to sleep. I heard a noise in the bushes at the edge of our camp and got up to see what it was. I was looking on my back again. Looking at the sky, I was very surprised because I thought I was dreaming. There was a misty shape briefly than well defined, nearby and just above the ground. It was changing shape at about 35 degrees above the horizon. It was "this the moon?" I said I did not know.

She went back to sleep. I looked at the glow. Suddenly it seemed to pull several times, growing brighter, larger and becoming more defined into a round shape about the size of a full moon. Then instantaneous it "exploded" into a large bright orange cloud, not circular in shape but more with a green-tinged fringe. I immediately was another one - smaller, but occurring in the same manner - that appeared a little further east and then another, making a total of four. All four glows faded. In perhaps three minutes the whole thing was over before disappearing.

However, I am sure that the account is accurate because I made notes
immediately after its occurrence. It was only because of our continuing
travels that I was unable to write so soon.

Please send me an explanation as soon as you can.

Note one
Pocatello, wisco main.
June 21 1966.

Dear Sir,-

This may have no bearing whatever on the article,... ...Sunday

...I've got to clear myself with friends and relatives after
mentioning hearing voices coming out of the sky between five and five-thirty
Sat. morning.here just might be some connection with these space radios.

I live on one of the highest hills in the Baraboo Range.its a dead end road
with peace and quiet.no so winds but the birds...no traffic.I sleep on inclosed porch
in front of cottage. I live alone all summer out happened to have my nephew and
his son visiting me.They slept in another cottage not far from mine.

I either was awake or the voices woke me.First it sounded like two men
talking out on the road. I said heard no car so it would have been very
unusual for anyone to be walking on this road...as it doesn't lead anyplace.Then
I decided that the voices were not on the road but coming from the sky. The dog
jumped down went to the door. he never barks at strangers.Only greets friends.
so he didn't say anything but he heard them...my next thought was it might be either
a sheriff or the electric flight we...with radios.I got up and look
at out but no one there.went back to bed then heard it again but it seemed to be
coming from the big relay tower at end of my property.I looked at clock and it was
5:30. I was sure no one was working there at that hour. Thought they must have left
so no way open but if so why hadn't I heard before.

these voices so mixed like so and trucks that go around advertising
shows and things.so I never can understand them.Its garbled.

my nephew heard nothing but his cabin is surrounded with trees and bushes.
some way not get through.when I told him he looked like he should send for the
in the short white coats.That is why I must clear myself.These voices were loud
and clear. I asked the man who checked the tower yesterday.he could not account
for it...can't have come from the tower...but could the towers big saucer have
some we have had unidentified flying objects around sin
before my wife in 4 wks...I mentioned we are on high hill.

Sincerely yours,

SUBJECT     UFO ANALYSIS
LOCATION    LIGAO, ALBAY, PHILIPPINES                          DATE    27 June 1966

AT          ________________    IR          ________________   QUALITY    ________________

1. PURPOSE: To analyze photography of purported UFO's that was taken by Mr. Jose C. Tuclan
to try and define the cause of the UFO's. The following materials were furnished TDDF for
analysis: Thirteen (13) borderless photographic prints. One (1) 13 exposure roll, size 120,
crossed negatives, cut into three sections at frame number 4, and torn at frame numbers 5,
6, and spliced back together at frame number 12. Film is identified as FUJI Safety Neopan
S.O.S. One (1) other dated 16 September 1966 from Jose C. Tuclan of the Republic of the
Philippines. One (1) partially completed PID Form 164.

2. ANALYSIS: Reference: PID Form 164, Section 35, Paragraph 1 - The observer's statement
that it is possible for a photographic film to record objects (wavelengths) which are invisible
to human eye, is completely true in that all silver halide materials are inherently more
sensitive at the ultra violet (short wave length) end of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The film used by the observer has no sensitivity in the infrared region of the spectrum.
This observation is based on the fact that standard films can be modified to extend the
sensitivity beyond about 7500 A.

Reference: PID Form 164, Section 35, Paragraph 4 - If these conditions, i.e., weightlessness,
invisibility, etc., are indeed true, the observer neglects to furnish us with
additional information as to what, when, where, and how to record these
objects, persons, etc. with his camera.

Reference: PID Form 164, Section 35, Paragraph 10 - In this paragraph the observer covers
the statement that he actually and conclusively disprove the film record by stating that
the images were indeed moving lights photographed with a stationary camera.

Following is an analysis of the aforementioned materials:

Frame #1 - The observer indicates in comment 31 messages to be deciphered, and
encloses an area in brackets approximately 2 inches wide. Is this the only message
area, or are no assumptions that all of the "seeing" are messages?

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 56-14, DATED 16 November 1966

There are several methods by which this photograph could be made. These methods could have been used singly or in combination:

a. Double printing technique, utilizing a positive transparency in register over the negative.

b. Double exposure technique by first photographing the basic scene then pointing the camera at a black background and somehow randomly moving a small light source across the black background while utilizing a chopper or a continuous motion picture type shutter in front of the lens to obtain the "pulsating" light effect.

c. Recording the basic scene and waiting until lights 1, 4, 2, and 5 are extinguished and then placing one or several small light sources at the scene and randomly creating the camera. Several extremely similar patterns exist in frame 1, strongly suggesting that this may have been the method utilized.

Frame #2 - This appears to have been done with two separate exposures, possibly from two different locations.

Tracking a, b, c, and d are identical in general shape differing only in width. This width difference could be accomplished by using an anamorphic lens on the camera, slightly rotated and imaging four light sources on the ground, opening the shutter and uniformly panning the camera downward. The tracking numbered "2" are identical and appear to constitute a second exposure. These "2" locations are microscopically and photographic analysis of the negative reveals at least four and possibly five images of the moon within the area marked "1" or "2".

Frame #3 - The invisible, transparent, and weightless spacecraft identified as "3" is in all probability an internal camera lens reflection (secondary image) from either of the lights marked "1" or "2". The trace marked "4" could have been accomplished by the aforementioned methods.

Frame #4 - Within the area marked "1" a microscopic examination of the negative reveals several (at least three and possibly six) images of the moon, again indicating multiple exposure.

Frame #5 - No analysis was made of the length of the star trace versus time to correlate the stated exposure time with the actual exposure time. As before, this photograph could be duplicated, with time and patience, utilizing multiple techniques.

The following materials were furnished TDDP for analysis: Thirteen (13) borderless photographic prints. One (1) 13 exposure roll, size 120, processed negatives, cut into two sections at frame number 4, and torn at frame number 5, cut and spliced back together at frame number 12.

The film used by the observer has no sensitivity in the infrared region of the spectrum. This office knows of no method by which standard films can be modified in order to extend the sensitivity beyond about 7500 A.

Reference: EED Form 164, Section 35, Paragraph 4 - If these conditions, i.e., weightlessness, boundless, invisible, etc., are indeed true, the observer neglects to furnish us with any detail all all arising from methods of knowing when, where, and how to record these objects, persons, etc. with his camera.

Reference: EED Form 164, Section 35, Paragraph 10 - In this paragraph the observer covers almost any attempt to logically and conclusively disprove these film records by stating that the images were indeed moving lights photographed with a stationary camera.

Following is an analysis of the aforementioned materials:

Frame #1 - The observer indicates in comment 31 messages to be declpered, and encloses an area in brackets approximately 2 inches wide. Is this the only message area, or are we to assume that all of the "tracings" are messages?

Several extremely similar patterns exist in frame 1, strongly suggesting that this may have been the method utilized.

Frame #2 - This appears to have been done with two separate exposures, possibly from two different locations.

Tracings a, b, c, and d are identical in general shape differing only in width. This with difference could be accomplished by using an anamorphic lens on the camera, slightly defocused and imaging four bright sources on the ground, opening the camera downward. The tracings numbered "2" are identical and appear to constitute a second exposure. Trace "E" is possibly a third exposure. A microscopic analysis of the negative reveal at least four distinct images within the area marked "1" on the print, indicating that at least four distinct exposures were made.

Frame #3 - The invisible, transparent, and weightless spaceship identified as "3" is in all probability an internal camera lens reflection (secondary image) from either of the lights marked "1" or "2". The trace marked "4" could have been accomplished by the aforementioned methods. (see frame #1 analysis)

Frame #4 - Within the area marked "1" a microscopic examination of the negative reveals several (at least three and possibly six) images of the moon, again indicating multiple exposure negatives.

Frame #5 - No analysis was made of the length of the star trace versus time to correlate the stated exposure time with the actual exposure time. As before, this photograph could be duplicated, with time and patience, utilizing multiple techniques.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 66-44, DATED 16 November 1966

Frames #6, #7, #8 and #9 - Once again, multiple moon images indicate that several exposures were used.

Frame #10 - In frame number 10, it appears as though the camera was swung to two different light sources against black background in order to make two trackings.

Frame #11 - Two, possibly three, exposures were utilized to make this photography as indicated by the basic background exposure and the two light traces.

Frame #12 - The spaceship is in an ideal location and approximately the correct intensity to be an internal camera lens reflection. The 'lighted door' in the spaceship would correspond to the specular highlight on the front element of a camera lens pointed directly at a bright light.

Frame #13 - This is probably a single exposure since the moon image is smeared rather than distinct as in several of the other frames. Once again the spaceship is probably a camera lens reflection. The door is in the correct position for a specular highlight caused by the light sources to the lower left.

It is the considered opinion of this office that the furnished materials and photographs do not represent imagery of spaceships and that the imagery was deliberately created by the photographer.

Dear Sir,

Wednesday 15th June 1966

The evening of Tuesday 14th June 1966 was a visitor friends at the field Road, Entumbane, with some friends having a drink on the back porch. Before entering the house I noticed a white object in the sky and called my friends attention to it. It was moving in an easterly and in a straight line from the north-east, moving towards the south-west. It was moving quite slowly, about 40° and would have passed below the Southern Cross. The time was 5.07 p.m.

In this matter we noticed another "star" in the same direction. Binoculars were used and the object was clearly seen. It was round and crossed the area of the first 30° and almost at the same angle. It was moving quite slowly and then stopped, then moved on a bit, then stopped again, moving in a jerky manner.

The first one had entered clouds and "went out". The second one continued in its circle and it too faded out. Some time then was 5.10 p.m. The night was clear, no clouds at all, the moon was about 30° up.

These things were very high, so thought of satellites or aircraft. But they were not aircraft as would have been clear then, but the night was and they made no sound. I have seen satellites before and they have always moved in straight lines only.

I have seen a "star" behaving like this before. It was during layover in December last, about 10 or 11.00 p.m. in the same sector. This is not certain as I am not quite sure and will just mention it.

Yours faithfully,

                                                      Day     Month     Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting/photograph.

1. These UFCs that I have discovered are invisible to our naked eye and can only be seen or recorded through the film of a camera, because the film has a wider spectrum of sensitivity than a human eye.

2. I believe that my discovery is entirely different from the flying saucer stories which are visible and can be heard by so many people who saw them.

3. I believe that these spaceships which are invisible, colorless, soundless and used by these super-intelligent beings who have messages in writings which are too hard to decipher came from another planet. Far more interesting than our cures and are for more interesting than all stories about the flying saucers.

4. Anti-Gravity (weightlessness) - They are weightless and leave no foot prints or produce any sound even while walking on roof tops.

5. They are using light sensitive battery as power for their equipment, because they always look for a source of light, before acting. So when starting their activities.

6. These beings are so extra-intelligent that can give messages or writing or perfect forms written in space with invisible lights or different forms or patterns.

7. Their spaceships are round and transparent ball shape.

8. Two other forms of spaceship are also used besides these ball and air ball invisible to the naked eye.

9. Frequently they used to appear on moonlight nights but solution on this night. During the moonlight nights of June, July and August, 1956 I have taken pictures of them. (U.S.)

10. They walk on light rays usually pulsating lights of different patterns, like ladder like lights, broken low line lights and other forms as indicated in the pictures.

11. They have the precision of an electronic machine while writing in space.


- page 61 -

Here is the text from the document:

12. For an earthman, it is indeed impossible to write in space without being detected or heard and can do any writing in a shift too for a picture taking.

13. As I have studied the many aspects of the photographs re-these UFOs I can conclude that invisibility, soundlessness and anti-gravity can be attained through the medium of light. There is even an old adage that there can be no life without light.

Poe Colonel, USAF, Congressional Inquiry Division, Office of Legislative Liaison, dated August 1, 1966 and acknowledged by the undersigned September 12, 1966.

In compliance with the letter, that I furnish the negatives together with the accomplished PTD Form 164 which was sent together with the letter, I am hereby sending (1) roll of film which contains pictures of the UFOs together with their corresponding prints.

For further inquiry pertaining to my findings, please don't hesitate to contact me if you can locate me. For I have a complete file of photographs regarding these UFOs from June, July, and August, 1966. I can again make their pictures in this office upon request. I am sending you 2 rolls of film in accordance with their accompanying pictures, prints are numbered 3 which are probably messages written by these beings which I am referring for your investigation.

In view of the foregoing, I hope I can be of help to your space research through my discovery of these invisible UFOs.

Very truly yours,

Dear Sir:

Last December 12, 1966, I have forwarded to your good office a follow-up letter to my previous letter of Sept. 16, 1966, containing my answers to Air Force Hgts. anent my discovery of UFO's here in my hometown of Ligao, Albay RP.

In view of your continued silence regarding my request for proper analysis and deciphering of the somewhat coded messages which these UFO's were trying to impart to me, I have become over restless for the past months and therefore I am constrained to appeal to your office to please send back my negatives which I badly need for my personal research and collection re-these UFO's. I am leaving the prints to your office for further study and research, so that in case you will find some interesting facts regarding the matter, you can easily contact me for proper exchange of views and opinions which will be of importance to your space research.

Sir, up to the present time I have develop a keener interest in these UFO's because there are new pictures that I have taken which were even witnessed by reliable citizens of my town which are really of interest and which delve deeper into this age of modern science and space travel. I am strictly keeping for myself only these discoveries so that I won't fall in the wrong hands, but if you won't even bother sending me your reply to my request for proper analysis, then I will write to any other interested parties which will give importance and valuable these discoveries. I am still giving you ample time to think it over, whether this is a scientific discovery or just a fragment of my imagination because I firmly believe, that this category is not even recorded in your project Blue Book that was sent to me by your office and therefore this I consider a unique discovery which no history and any book of Technology can be used as reference pertaining to these invisible UFO.

In closing therefore, I am still very eager to know your ideas and thoughts regarding my discovery of which I am very confident that in the long run your good office will be able to realize the importance of my discovery to your space program which is costing the U.S. government billions of dollars as well as human

Air Force Headquarters (SAFOICC)
Washington, D.C. 20330

Sirs:

I am too eager to be informed as to the status of my previous letter sent to your good office last September 16, 1966 which up to now has remained unanswered.

Please be informed that our letter of the above-mentioned date contains 13 UFO's Prints, (1) roll of UFO's negative containing 13 frames and (1) Accomplished FTD Form 164. I hope if ever said letter was acknowledged by your good office, the necessary analysis would be performed by competent men of your department so as to clarify once and for all the relation of my discovery to modern science and technology.

During that time interval when I sent my letter as of September 16, 1966 up to now, there are other people who has seen and observed those moving and flying objects whose figures cannot be fully determined. An employee of the Abaca Corporation of the Philippines which is opposite my house has witnessed the landing of their 'space-ship' in my roof top. To erase all angles of doubt I have tried four types of cameras and four different kinds of films, and I have found out that all the results are the same. Up to the month of November I have taken many more pictures of these UFO's and these would be added to my accumulated UFO pictures in my possession. Pictures I have taken last October and November reveals many messages which are indeed very hard to decipher and another moving form registered by the camera seems to change its position and location in the picture.

Sir, if and when you have acknowledge my previous letter, please inform the undersigned as to its evaluation. If there was any uncertainty in order that I be relieved of my worries and uneasiness which up to now is being encountered by me due to your silence pertaining to my request. If ever you are through with my pictures and negatives please spare some time to return them to me as they are part of my precious collections. Again I am willing to send to your good office some more pictures regarding these UFO's taken the previous months of September, October and November upon my request and the full guarantee that they will be returned to me after being evaluated.

In this regard, I hope you will take more interest in my discovery if they are of relation to the present age of space.

In closing I wish you all in your department a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year.

Very truly yours,

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT    NR 66-44

SUBJECT: UFO ANALYSIS
LOCATION: LIGAO, ALBAY, PHILIPPINES    DATE: 27 June 1966

PAGE 1 OF 3 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT: 16 November 1966

1. PURPOSE: To analyze photography of purported UFO's that was taken by Mr. Jose C. Tucian
to try and define the cause of the UFO's. The following materials were furnished IDDP for
analysis: Thirteen (13) borderless photographic prints. One (1) 16 exposure roll, size 120,
crossed negatives, cut into two sections at frame number 4, and torn at frame number 5,
split and spliced back together at frame number 12. Film is identified as FUJI Safety Neopan
S.S.G. One (1) later dated 16 September 1966 from Town of San Jose, Republic of the
Philippines. One (1) partially completed FID Form 154.

2. ANALYSIS: References: FID Form 161, Section 35, Paragraph 1 - The observer's statement
that it is possible for a extraterrestrial form to record objects (wavelengths) which are invisible
to the human eye, is completely true in that all silver halide materials are inherently more
sensitive to the ultra violet (short wave length) end of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The film used by the observer has no sensitivity in the infrared region of the spectrum.
This office knows of no method by which standard film can be modified in order to extend
the sensitivity beyond 1300 A.

Reference: FID Form 154, Section 35, Paragraph 4 - If these conditions, i.e., weightlessness,
soundless, invisible, etc., etc. are indeed true, the observer neglects to furnish us with
any detail at all regarding his methods, means, when, where, and how to record these
objects, persons, etc. with his camera.

Reference: FID Form 154, Section 35, Paragraph 11 - In this paragraph the observer covers
himself by stating that he probably did not photograph anything but states that the
images were indeed moving lights photographed with a stationary camera.

Following is an analysis of the aforementioned materials:

Frame #1 - The observer indicates in comment 31 messages to be deciphered, and
encloses an area in brackets approximately 2 inches wide. Is this the only message
area, or are we to assume that all of the "trackings" are messages?

1. PURPOSE: To analyze photography of purported UFO's that was taken by [redacted] to try and define the cause of the UFO's. The following materials were furnished TDDP for analysis: Thirteen (13) borderless photographic prints. One (1) 13 exposure roll, size 120, processed negatives, cut into two sections at frame number 4, and torn at frame number 5.

2. ANALYSIS: Reference: ATP Form 164, Section 35, Paragraph 1 - The observer's statement that it is possible for a photographic film to record objects (wavelengths) which are invisible to the human eye, is completely untrue. In that all silver halide materials are inherently more sensitive at the ultra-violet (short wave length) and of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The film used by the observer has no sensitivity in the infrared region of the spectrum. This office knows of no method by which standard film can be modified to extend the sensitivity beyond about 7500 A.

Reference: ATP Form 164, Section 35, Paragraph 4 - If these conditions, i.e., weightlessness, invisible, etc., are indeed true, the observer neglects to furnish us with any detail at all regarding his method and how to record these objects, persons, etc. with his camera.

Reference: ATP Form 164, Section 35, Paragraph 10 - In this paragraph the observer covers almost any attempt to "easily" and conclusively disprove these film records by stating that the images were indeed moving lights photographed with a stationary camera.

Following is an analysis of the aforementioned materials:

Frame #1 - The observer indicates in comment 31 messages to be deciphered, and enclosed an area in brackets approximately 2 inches wide. Is this the only message area, or are we to assume that all of the "tracings" are messages?

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 66-44     DATED 16 November 1966

Frames #5, #7, #3 and #9 - Once again, multiple moon images indicate that several exposures were used.

Frame #10 - In frame number 10, it appears as though the camera was swung to two different light sources against black background in order to make two trackings.

Frame #11 - Two, possibly three, exposures were utilized to make this photography as indicated by the basic background exposure and the two light traces.

Frame #12 - The spacecraft is in an ideal location and approximately the correct intensity to be an inner camera lens reflection. The 'lighted door' in the spacecraft would correspond to the specular highlight on the front element of a camera lens pointed directly at a bright light.

Frame #13 - This is probably a single exposure since the moon image is smeared rather than distinct as in several of the other frames. Once again the spacecraft is probably a camera lens reflection. The door is in the correct position for a specular highlight caused by the light source.

It is the considered opinion of this office that the furnished materials and photographs do not represent imagery of spacecraft and that the imagery was deliberately created by the photographer.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 56-44 , DATED 16 November 1966

Frames #6, #7, #8 and #9 - Once again, multiple moon images indicate that several exposures were used.

Frame #10 - In frame number 10, it appears as though the camera was swung to two different light sources against black background in order to make two trackings.

Frame #11 - Two, possibly three, exposures were utilized to make this photography as indicated by the basic backing and exposure and the two light traces.

Frame #12 - The spaceship is in an ideal location and approximately the correct intensity to be an internal camera lens reflection. The 'lighted door' in the spaceship would correspond to the angular highlight on the front element of a camera lens pointed directly at a bright light.

Frame #13 - This is probably a single exposure since the moon image is smeared rather than distinct as in several of the other frames. Once again this spaceship is probably a camera lens reflection. The door is in the correct position for a specular highlight caused by the light source to the lower left.

It is the considered opinion of this office that the furnished materials and photographs do not represent imagery of spacecraft and that the imagery was deliberately created by the photographer.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 66-44, DATED 16 November 1966

There are several methods by which this photograph could be made. These methods could have been used singly or in combination:

a. Double printing technique, utilizing a positive transparency in register over the negative.

b. Double exposure technique by first photographing the basic scene then pointing the camera at a black background and somehow randomly moving a small light source across the black background while utilizing a chopper or a continuous picture type shutter in front of the lens to obtain the "pulsating" light effect.

c. Recording the basic scene and waiting until lights 1, 4, 2, and 5 are extinguished and then placing one or several small light sources at the scene and randomly grating the camera. Several extremely similar patterns exist in frame 1, strongly suggesting that this may have been the method utilized.

Frame #2 - This appears to have been done with two separate exposures, possibly from two different locations.

Tracings a, b, c, and d are identical in general shape differing only in width. This width difference could be accomplished by using an anamorphic lens on the camera, slightly tilting the camera downward, or by using a ground glass shutter and uniformly panning the camera downward. The tracings numbered "2" are identical and appear to constitute a second exposure. A microscopic analysis of the negative reveals at least four and possibly five images of the moon within the area marked "1" in print, indicating that at least four distinct exposures were made.

Frame #3 - The invisible, transparent, and weightless spaceship identified as "3" is in all probability an internal camera lens reflection (secondary image) from either of the lights marked "1" or "2". The area marked "4" could have been accomplished by the aforementioned methods.

Frame #4 - Within the area marked "1" a microscopic examination of the negative reveals several (at least three and possibly six) images of the moon, again indicating multiple exposure negatives.

Frame #5 - No analysis was made of the length of the star trace versus time to correlate the stated exposure time with the actual exposure time. As before, this photograph could be duplicated, with time and patience, utilizing multiple techniques.

There is very little legible text on this page. The only clearly visible text are the small labels "5", "2", and "3" on the top of what appears to be a black and white photographic or scientific image. The rest of the page is mostly white with a dark photographic/imaging panel at the bottom of the page.
