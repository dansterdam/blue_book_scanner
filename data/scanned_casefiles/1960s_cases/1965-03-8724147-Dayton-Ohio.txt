There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

At 1600 hours, 3 Mar 65, USAF(UFO) received a call from Mr. Porter, Base Information Officer, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The caller stated that a Mrs. Dayton (Dayton, Ohio) phone number censored, had called him and reported seeing a UFO. 

According to Mrs. Dayton, this occurred about 1545 hours, 3 Mar 65. When she came over the knoll on her farm, she observed an object in the field approximately 1/4 mile away. She said it hovered about 10 feet above the ground and looked like it was coming out of the ground. It was disc-shaped, about the size of a small car, and had a reddish glow around it. She also said it had 4 or 5 appendages hanging down from the bottom. The object remained in view for about 30 seconds and then suddenly disappeared. She didn't believe that she had seen anything. Her son came in again and said he saw the same thing. She appeared to be a normal, rational person and was not afraid people would think she was crazy. She appeared to be a calm, middle-aged housewife.

On 3 March 1965, Sgt Moody called Mrs. Dayton at her home. Mrs. Dayton stated that about 1545 hours, 3 Mar 65, while she was hanging clothes on her line, she observed a brightly lighted object in her field. The object was round or disc-shaped, about the size of a small car, and had a reddish or orange glow around it. It hovered about 10 feet above the ground for about 30 seconds and then suddenly disappeared. The lights did not go off when it disappeared, looked like it was simply going towards the horizon. At first thought it was an aircraft, however it hovered in place without any noise. The lights went out all of a sudden, not just dimming. One bright light was seen about the same time as the object appeared. Mrs. Dayton said her son also saw the object but did not come outside with her. She was not excited or nervous when she called and said she had not been drinking. She was just puzzled by what she had seen. It was a clear day and the object was about 1/4 mile away. 

Mrs. Dayton stated that these 3 boys say it, including her son, around 0800 from the Dayton-Patterson area. They said the object came up off the ground and then went overhead at a high rate of speed. At one time it was stationary, then it shot off at a high rate. The boys observed the UFO for a short time, probably less than a minute. The description matched that of what Mrs. Dayton had observed.

Mrs. Dayton's husband, Mr. Dayton, got on the phone. He wanted to tell us that anybody on a wild goose chase. His wife was excited when he came home from work and so was he. At first he thought it was an aircraft or something of that sort. He was informed that we would callback at 1900 hours to talk to them again.

A check was made with Sgt Young, at USAF ODM, there were no holo flights seen or reported on that date. A CE-1 took-off at 0620. A C-131 took-off at 0629.
The weather at 0957 at 3,000 ft was overcast, a temperature was 9°, seven mile visibility, light rain showers, wind from 030° at 2 knots. As a result the control tower was alerted. We at 0950 was 3,000 overcast.
Sgt. Young spoke with it Russ Gerry, phone 253-1231 of the City of Dayton Observation Dept. The object observed as unusual. It traveld 15 Salem Avenue looking towards town. Observed a bright shiny object did not resembling anything.  At 0930 house until 0925 he was at the corner of Glenwood and it was departing methodically, he was interested in the object which his partner said they could not have. The object increased in speed and then left in the distance.
We again placed a call to the City of Dayton Police Department and spoke with the chief's office, negative reply after checking around. Included checking with Gentleship and Edwards AFB and they have negative observations.
Checked with Fire Department, no runs were made during that time.
Check was made with Al intervistial and his assistant. He wasn't up at that hour nor were his people.
The following information was obtained from Mr. Selzer, FAA at W-P AFB, extension 76360. There was a group-46 practice approach (instrument) using runway - 2L, satisfactory. No further information.
CONCLUSION: The project conducted an evaluation of the 22-15 making its practice landings. Observations with the C-131 connected for the latter observations.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object was not visible when the witness first noticed it. At approximately 8:10 p.m., the witness noticed that there appeared to be a dim, mist-like object hovering only a few feet from the ground. The object then began moving slowly, but rapidly gained speed and altitude. The object appeared to be oval-shaped and had no lights. The witness said that the object seemed to be picking up smoke or dust from the ground as it moved. The object disappeared from view in a northeasterly direction after about 2 minutes.

OCR Text:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: _____ Day _____ Month _____ Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object appeared to be about the size of a compact car and was shaped somewhat like two saucers placed base to base. It was brilliantly lighted and seemed to be rotating about a vertical axis. It moved in a zigzag or irregular fashion across the sky at a very high rate of speed. It disappeared almost directly overhead moving at a high rate of speed. It could not have been any conventional aircraft known to me. The flight pattern was not at all like an airplane or helicopter. The speed was extremely high and the rotating, zigzag motion was foreign to any known aircraft. I have never seen anything like it before. It appeared to be some kind of unconventional aircraft.
