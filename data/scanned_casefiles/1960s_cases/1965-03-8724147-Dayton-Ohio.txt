At 1600 hours, 2 Mar 65, TDEN(UFO) received a call from Mr Porter, Base Information Office, WPAFB, Ohio. Mrs. [redacted] Drive, Dayton, Ohio (Dayton View), phone [redacted] reported that at about 0415, 2 Mar 65 she and her son observed a dome shaped object, some shaped at the bottom. Five legs came out of the bottom of it. Only made noise when it came over. When it hovered, no sound. Looked like it was coming out to the base (WAP). Her son was the first to see the object, came in and told his mother about it, she went out to see but did not see any object. She didn't believe that he had seen anything. Her son came in again and said he saw it, this time she went out and saw it also. It made about eleven passes. Mr Porters said that [redacted] seemed reluctant to call the Base as she was afraid people would think she was crazy. She appeared to be a rational woman.

On 3 March 1965, SSgt Moody called [redacted] at her home. [redacted], a first year object at OHOL, was at about 0515 to 0530, 2 Mar 65. With description that her son gave he thought perhaps it was a spotlight on the clouds. Said the object circled the area until about 0630, disappeared with daybreak. Looked like it was going towards the Field. It went partly overhead and then towards the field and came around and dipped. The lights did go off when it dipped, looked like it was circling the city of Dayton, according to [redacted]. When she first saw it come across the sky, quite an arch, did hear it come in. Looked like it was right above tree top level. Thought at first it was an aircraft, hovered in place, lights went out, sounded like a jet when it renewed. Then it again hovered there was no sound. One bright light. About the same size as an aircraft with no blinking lights at all. The light was the only thing observed. She did not hear something you heard about but did not expect to see something like it.

[redacted] told that three boys saw it, including her son, around 0445 from a boys front yard looking towards Wright-Patterson. They said that when it got near Wright-Patterson it did tip and then went overhead. At one time it appeared to have five lights or windows. Appeared to be a big bubble. Mrs [redacted] called one of the boys together and she relayed what her boy had seen. The description matched what [redacted] had observed. The boys observed it from a yard on Oxford Drive, in Dayton View. In that area they have steep driveways and you can see the layout of the city of Dayton.

Mrs [redacted] husband [redacted] got on the phone. He wanted to tell us that he didn't think his wife and kids were sending anybody on a wild goose chase. His wife was excited when he came home from work and saw his son. At first he thought perhaps it was spotlights on clouds. He did not see it but believes that something did occur. He just wanted to know if there were any other reports that could tell them if it was an aircraft or something of that sort. We informed him that reports of this nature were not uncommon and not unusual. We informed them that we would callback at 1600 hours to talk to [redacted].

A check was made with Sgt Young, at Base Ops, there were no helo flights out of Wright-Patterson. A B-52 took-off at 0420, a C-31 took-off at 0607, a C-31 took-off at 0629.

The weather data on 2 Mar at 0357 at 9,000 ft was overcast, temperature 140, seven mile visibility, Light rain showers, wind from 030° at 2 knots, 1°K at 0456 local was same, 1°K at 0510 local was 3,000 overcast.

Sgt Moody spoke with Lt Russ Guerra, phone 223-1231 of the City of Dayton Police Department. Lt Guerra was up at 0500 hours on 2 Mar 65 and did not observe anything unusual. He traveled in Salem Avenue looking towards town at approximately 0545 and did not see anything unusual. At 0600 hours until 0623 he was at the corner of Meadmore and Rt 25 waiting for his delocopter. He was constantly checking the sky for weather. He saw nothing in the sky, not any stars either. He said that if anybody saw it the Dayton Tower might have.

We again placed a call to the City of Dayton Police Department and spoke with the Chief's office, negative reply after checking around, included checking with telephone operators who might have taken reports.

Checked with Fire Department, no runs were made during that time.

Check was made with Al Butterfield and his helo's. He wasn't up at that hour nor were his helo's.

The following information was obtained from Mr Seiler, FAA at W-P AFB, extension 7082. There was a Rebop-45, practice approaches (instrument) using runway 5 at Patterson Field. This was a KC-135, it made 5 landings, 6 not, altogether 11 made seven distinct passes over the town, between 0435 and 0540 hours.

Mrs [redacted] was informed of the above at 1500 hours, 3 Mar 65.

Conclusion: Mrs [redacted] and her son observed the KC-135 making its practice landings and the C-31 and C-31 accounts for the latter observations.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I was persuaded that the sighting while it spotted at 10:22 p.m. March 30, was of interest to the Air Force, until I happened to see an account in the paper about a UFO near Kenslaw. The first the document spotted seeing the object was along some way in Kell and after the day I have of tell call with HAFC on Sat. Apr. 3.

The object or light had appeared strange to me because I shall not see it's direct form. There were few cars, planes in the area but some else seemed to be confused with this sighted object.

I saw the shape, just the light moving in a southwesterly direction for a few seconds. Then the object went out of sight. The time...

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object at high up in sky, appeared as a light, part solid part transparent. Bright, color white light gave like sun. Sharply outlined, no motion or erratic motion. Some like color with haze, 1st was 1 deg in dia, 2nd bigger 15 min in length, speed estimated at 25 miles per hour, major ball, estimated at 60 deg in sky, then saw the object disappear. Observed at 0715, report 1 April 65.

COMMENTS: Multiple reports of sighting from this witness, but little concept of good description or other aspects of reporting, azimuth and elevation indicate an object hit in sky at 0 deg, 1st at 15 deg azimuth, likely 4 or 5 deg elevation. Witness unable to make out details.
