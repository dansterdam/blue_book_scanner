TWO The observer observed two bright lights in the sky. The lights were very bright, steady, and remained stationary for about 15 minutes. The observer reported that the lights were about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. Another UFO was seen both visually and on radar.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION It appears that an aircraft was responsible for the lights, but the observer believes them to be unusual and unexplained based on his experience. The investigating officers feel that the object could not be identified satisfactorily.

Force's radar equipment below certain altitudes at certain distances is classified information. However, the following statement can be made without disclosing classified information: It is believed that certain objects within certain altitudes and distances from the radar are not classified. There was, beyond any reasonable doubt, an object at or very close to an altitude of 8,200'.

The final approach landing pattern from M-6 "Any light from planes in this area is very close to the horizon, if they were visible." Pertaining to landing times of various plan- as at Minot AFB 6 Sept 52, no RE-120-3 CO2222 is in agreement as follows: (1) Sightings began at 2245; (2) the sighting reported by A/C Turner of 1300Z at Minot tower was approximately 0222z (no accurate time is available); (3) The location of the white light around (4) the discharge from the reactor core is the opinion of the undersigned that given a very high probable analysis by which Lts. Haut and Gorman were convinced and that (5) and (6) and the same (A2C Aldrich's statements) it is the opinion of the undersigned that there is no way to prove this.

1. This office has no explanation for this incident. It seems possible that ball lightning (or similar) was sighted in an aerial maneuver which caused a temporary failure to interruptcommunications - but not for 36 hours.

It is suggested that this is an ideal case with which to inaugurate the $300,000 contract with the University of Colorado.

1. I am forwarding this letter for Col Lemanski in that he is presently in the hospital for an eye operation. However, much to the collector's regret, he will be unable to conduct further exploratory operation.

2. With reference to the questions in your letter the following information is provided:

a. The sighting was taken to the scene of the original sighting (M-6) by the undersigned. He indicated the following: (0 degrees is true north, 90 degrees true east, 180 degrees true south, 270 degrees true west).

b. With reference to the questions. The first was a multi-colored object, which will be described in more detail later. He did not observe the second object. The first object (which generated his report via radio) was very high and looked most of the time as approximately 10 degrees.

c. The observer's drawing was done by himself. The first object, from his description, was estimated to be from 50 to 100 feet in size, and about 20 miles away. The direction was from south to north during the observation. The undersigned is not sure that he was pointing in the right direction as indicated by the night direction fences as a reference point. The back fence is on the north side of the sighting.

(2) He noticed the second object after the strike team arrived and pointed to it. This object is described as the "white light" and stated it was moving in a horizontal direction at approximately the same height as the first object, but appeared to be some distance, or approximate 1-1/2 miles away. Attachment #1 is a drawing made by A3C Turner of the first object. It represents the shape of the object as it appeared to the observer. The cloud and thus formed a silhouette. The last point made by A3C Turner was to verify that the object he saw horizontally was not the first object moving north, but the second object.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

A29 Holiday, the strike team leader, was also interviewed by the undersigned at M-4 during hours of darkness. He provided the following information:

A few days after the incident, A29 Turner approached the wife they had with them (hereafter referred to as the "object") and said the object had been tracked at various times up to 100 degrees on the compass. Upon arrival at the site, A29 Turner pointed out an unusually bright object on the ground to approximately 70 degrees which was very high. After examining the object for some time, they turned back to the "white light". He observed that the "white light" was approximately 100 degrees which was very close to the first object he had pointed out. The object he had pointed out to them could not be found again.

During the interview, the striking force leader (A29 Holiday) was also interviewed at M-4. He kept his attention on a white object at approximately 100 degrees which was very close to the first object A29 Turner had pointed out. The object also disappeared at various times for approximately 30 seconds at a time.

A29 Holiday had been on leave since 12 December 1966 and was not available for questioning.

A Attachment #2 is a transcript of the sequence of events recorded in the log book at south base (radar base). Attachment #3 represents a radar track obtained at Minot AFB. As a result of the further stated that the "object" was on his radar scope continuously from the time he picked it up until it was lost by intermittent BUIC I Central Control approximately 1800 hours, approximately 15 mins after the visual sighting on the ground. Sgt Semcho stated that the object disappeared, or was lost by radar, but they could not regain contact. The object did not alter its course except during the period when the fighter was in the area. The object did not alter its course when the interceptor plus fighter was in the area. The object did not alter its course when a second F-4 Phantom II fighter from the 5th Tactical Fighter Squadron, who piloted the intercept plane, was advised that he flew intermittently out of sight for a blood 30,000 ft, 30,000 ft, and back again. His plane's radar equipment and infrared detection equipment recorded no contact. It was not necessary for you to write Col Duncan C. Myers, Director of Operations, Grand Forks Air Defense Sector, detailing the information. The undersigned was unable to secure this particular sequence of events.

If you asked several questions about the credibility of radar to detect an object at 95 miles. It will be necessary to limit the information provided on this area because the exact capabilities of the Air

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO-like object. The sketch appears to be a simple outline of an unidentified flying object with a curved, elongated shape. There is a note below the sketch that provides an explanation about the object, stating that when the sighting occurred, the object was not seen clearly due to clouds obscuring the view.

Transcribing the text in the document:

Note: when the object passed, it was not seen clearly at first because of a thin haze or cloud, the edge of the object was indistinct, and it looked longer and more oval than it actually was. When the object passed through the haze, the exact shape and size of the object was observed.
