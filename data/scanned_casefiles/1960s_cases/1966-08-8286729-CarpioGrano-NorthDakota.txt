11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Various observers reported two bright lights in the sky. The lights were red, green, yellow, and white in color. Under half a mile of observation, two UFOs were seen coming to the witnesses the UFO swooped low over the ground. Another UFO was seen both visually and on camera.

A detailed study of the information revealed that it appears that an aircraft was present. No other explanation for the observation. A F-106 was sent to investigate. The pilot reported nothing unusual. It is believed to be that of another aircraft. Very often started to become excited and see more than was actually in the act. The investigating officer feels that the white light was indeed an aircraft.

Force's radar equipment below certain altitudes at certain distances is classified information. However, the following statement can be made without disclosing classified information because it involves one of the combinations of altitude (8,200') and distance (95 miles) which is excluded from the area of classified information. There was, beyond any reasonable doubt, after considering all related factors of distance, weather, refraction, etc., an object at or very close to an altitude of 8,200'.

g. With reference to the tanker operation, it is possible to see the final approach landing pattern from M-6. Any light from planes in this area would be very close to the horizon, if they were visible, because of the topographical location of M-6. The following information pertains to landing times of various planes at Minot AFB:
(1) B-52, 06000; (2) KC-135, 06292, and (3) KC-135, 06292. No other plane landed between 0330 and 0730. The sighting of the first object was reported by A3C Turner at 0l002. Based on the following factors: (1) the strike teams arrived at M-6 at approximately 0520c (no accurate time is available); (2) the location of the white light around 100 degrees and very close to the horizon and (3) and the movement of the white light between approximately 75 and 110 degrees (A2C Aldrich's statements) it is the opinion of the undersigned that there is a very high probability that the white light was in fact one of the afore-mentioned planes preparing to land at Minot AFB. However, there is no way to prove this.

0520   AC      Received a call from A3C Kazmierzzaka Base
             Ops (Operations) Dispatcher @ North Base requesting
             the Alt. (Altitude) of a possible UFO (Unidentified
             Flying Object) approx (approximately) 360° 75 miles
             from Minot AFB (Air Force Base). Object was
             believed to be at first 30 miles high. Advised
             North Base that we were unable to detect Alt's
             (altitudes) that high on our Height Finder's but would
             check our search radar. On Search Radar pick-up a
             target @ 357° 95 miles from us. Advised North Base of
             contact. Object appeared to be large on a B-52,
             Shape: Round on top, emitting & changing colors,
             Green, yellow, red & white. When object became Red
             in color the object appeared small, but when white
             object seemed very, very large. UFO (Unidentified
             Flying Object) was seen and reported by personnel at
             3 different missile sites.

Comments: Capt Smith (Missile Command) Crew Commander on duty at Missile
Site (MIKE Flt) sixty (60) feet underground indicated that radio transmission was being interrupted by static, this static was accompanied by
the UFO coming close to the Missile Site (MIKE Flt). When UFO climbed,
static stopped. The UFO appeared to S.E. of MIKE 6, range undetermined.
At 0512Z, UFO climbed for altitude after hovering for 15 minutes. South
Radar base gave altitude as 100,000 feet, N.W. of Minot AFB, NDak. At
this time a strike team reported UFO descending, checked with Radar Site
they also verified this. The UFO then began to swoop and dive. It then
appeared to land 10 to 15 miles South of MIKE 6, "MIKE 6" Missile Site
Control sent a strike team to check. When the team was about 10 miles
from the landing sight, static disrupted radio contact with them. Five
(5) to eight (8) minutes later, the glow diminished and the UFO took off.
Another UFO was visually sighted and confirmed by radar. The one that
was first sighted passed beneath the second. Radar also confirmed this.
The first, made for altitude toward the North and the second seemed to
disappear with the glow of red. A3C SEDOVIC at the South Radar base
confirmed this also. At 0619Z, two and one half (2½) hours after first
sighting, an F-106 interceptor was sent up. No contact or sighting was
established. The Control Tower asked the Aircraft Commander of a KC-135
which was flying in the local area to check the area. He reported nothing.
The Radar Site picked up an echo on radar which on checking was the KC-135.
No other sightings. At 0645Z discontinued search for UFO.

l. None.

1.   This office has no explanation for this incident. It seems
possible that ball lightning (as discussed in an article on UFO's
by the editor of "Aviation Week") might well cause static sufficient
to interrupt communications — but not for 3½ hours.

2.   It is suggested that this is an ideal case with which to
inaugurate the $300,000 contract with the University of Colorado.

1. I am answering this letter for Col Lemanski in that he is presently
in the hospital. Upon his initial entry in the hospital serious dis-
orders were suspected, however much to the relief of all of us 700 men
who work with him, everything was found to be perfectly O.K. after an
exploratory operation.

2. With reference to the questions in your letter the following infor-
mation is provided.

    a. A3C Turner was taken to the scene of the original sighting (M-6)
    by the undersigned. He indicated the following: (0 degrees is true
    north, 90 degrees true east, 180 degrees true south, and 270 degrees
    true west; degrees were interpolated from the directions in which the
    subjects pointed by the undersigned)

    (1) He observed two objects. The first was a multi-colored
    object, which will be described in more detail later. He did not
    observe the second object until after the strike team arrived and he
    described it as the "white light". The first object (the one which
    generated his report via radio) was very high and located most of the
    time at approximately 40 degrees. However, it did move between approx-
    imately 0 degrees and 55 degrees. When A3C Turner was asked by the
    undersigned how he could be sure that he was pointing in the right
    direction he stated that he knew he was pointing in the right direction
    because the night he observed the object he used the "back side of the
    fence" as a reference point. The back fence is on the north side of
    the site.

    (2) He noticed the second object after the strike team arrived
    and pointed it out to him. He called it the "white light" and stated
    that it was very close to the horizon at approximately 100 degrees.
    Attachment #1 is a drawing made by A3C Turner of the first object. It
    represents the image of the object as it passed in front of some clouds.
    Light seemed to come from the back side of the object and reflect off
    the cloud and thus formed a silhouette. The last point made by A3C
    Turner was the fact that shortly after the strike team arrived, as he
    was trying to watch both the "white light" and the first object, he
    lost track of the first object.

b. A20 Holiday, the strike team leader, was also interviewed by the undersigned at M-6 during hours of darkness. He provided the following information: As he and his rider (A3G Aldrich) approached the site they were watching a "white" light very close to the horizon at approximately 80 to 100 degrees. Upon arrival at the site A3G Turner pointed out an "unusually bright" object at approximately 20 degrees which was very high. After looking at it for a few moments A3G Aldrich turned his attention back to the "white light". He observed the "white light" for some time. After a while he looked back to the north to find the "unusually bright object" that A3G Turner had pointed out to him, but he could not find it.

c. A3G Aldrich, the strike team rider, was also interviewed at M-6 by the undersigned during hours of darkness. The information he provided was as follows: He did not see the first object, although he did hear the other personnel (A3G Turner, A3G Mueller, and A20 Holiday) mention it. He kept his attention on a white object at approximately 100 degrees which was very close to the horizon. He further stated that the object he was watching moved between approximately 75 and 110 degrees. The object also disappeared at various times for approximately 30 seconds at a time.

d. A3G Mueller has been on leave since 12 December 1966 and was not available for questioning.

e. Attachment #2 is a transcript of the sequence of events recorded in the log book at south base (radar base). Attachment #3 represents a pattern of the courses flown by the intercept plane as observed by the radar observer, SSgt Angel Camacho. Sgt Camacho further stated that the "object" was on his radar scope continuously from the time he picked it up until he relieved at approximately 0900xlu (3AM Central Standard Time). The extract from the log book is also in Zulu time, which is equal to Central Standard Time plus six hours. Sgt Camacho stated that the object in question was "by itself" on his scope and that no other aircraft, ground clutter, or random "noise" bits were within 20-30 miles of the object on his scope except during the period when the fighter was in the area. The object did not disappear from his scope when the intercept plane flew it's route. The undersigned spoke to Capt Burg, 5th Fighter Intercept Squadron, who piloted the intercept plane. He advised that he flew intercept courses at, as he remembers it, 1000', 2000', 3000', 4000', and 5000'. Capt Burg further stated that he made no visual contact and that his plane's radar equipment and infrared detection equipment recorded no contact. If you wish to have a sequence of events between the intercept plane and the control station (Great Falls Air Defense Sector) it will be necessary for you to write Col Duncan C. Myers, Director of Operations, Great Falls Air Defense Sector, Malmstrom AFB, Montana, 59102. The undersigned was unable to secure this particular sequence of events.

f. You asked several questions about the capability of radar to detect an object at 95 miles. It will be necessary to limit the information provided on this area because the exact capabilities of the Air
