Here is the text from the document:

PLACE AN "X" AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. AN "X" IS USED TO INDICATE THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

SAF-OICC/Miss Turner/76526/Oct. 29, 1968

Dear [redacted]

This replies to your letter dated October 23, 1968, in which you reported that you and a friend had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it to the attached envelope, people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation. We are also enclosing an additional questionnaire in the event that your friend who saw the object cares to complete it.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO Investigator. He is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which will usually result in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch

Gentlemen:

We have sighted a U.S.O.
between 6:45-7:05 P.M.
Central Daylight Time. Sighting occurred at
about 6:57 P.M. Possible in Wisconsin, Wis.
my lot of course, however, was completely
different. As far as I file sole flying Suborn
Voyager to tell it as it is, of sole item.

This is not a hoax so
please this was seriously true
and not insane.

6A: NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT IS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
