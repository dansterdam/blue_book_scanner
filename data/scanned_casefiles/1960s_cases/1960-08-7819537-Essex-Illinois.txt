Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

Your recent letter to Prairie Farmer has been forwarded to Chanoute Air Force Base for our reply.

We are not expert on this matter, by any means, however, we believe that there is no harm associated with the foil, and that it would in no way be dangerous to living creatures.

If you have any further doubts concerning the foil, I suggest that you contact the Office of Information, Office Secretary of the Air Force, Washington, D.C.

Sincerely,

GEORGE W. OGLES
1/Lt., USAF
Information Officer
