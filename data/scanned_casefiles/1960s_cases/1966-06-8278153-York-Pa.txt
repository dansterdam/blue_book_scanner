To Whom it May Concern: 

Enclosed find report of investigation of sight ing. April 16, 1966 
near Wrightsville, Pa. 

It seems that a farmer in York County, Pa. observed a strange object 
flying overhead on the above date. Description of object: Oblong shaped, 
very bright, giving off a brilliant light, and making a definite noise. 
It traveled very fast and was airborne for a period of 10 to 15 minutes. 
It appeared to be approximately 100 feet in length.
Two other individuals were present and also viewed the strange aerial 
object and similarly first observed it at a distance of about 1 miles and 
what they could best estimate as through binocular lens. The object could 
not be identified as any known type aircraft and moved with great speed 
through the atmosphere. (See 164)

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

There is tales of three with out leaves on the trees of the right of the road and it was very dark and the noise of radiational motors. What might be very bright round blinking on and off slowly that could be seen through the trees and could not know what it was up to this time but that of a unknown aircraft maneauvering for about one hour or a little longer. And did sit of several causes, but they were few and not know where they really stand to a full conclusion type.

The image contains a photograph showing a newspaper article with the headline "Family Sights 'Saucer'". The article describes a sighting of an unidentified flying object by a family in York, Pennsylvania. The photograph shows the landscape and buildings in the area where the sighting occurred.

Family Sights 'Saucer'
A York, Pa., family reported sighting a flying object in the sky shortly before 7 a.m. this morning within 700 yards of their home. Zion's View, described the object as a grayish-white oval-shaped saucer that hovered over the trees to the west of their home and appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. Other members of the family witnessed the object as it moved with a rocking motion and at times appeared to turn on its side. No sound was heard. The state highway department says a survey crew assisting in construction work on a new elementary school in York county was working in the area at the time but had seen no unusual activity, although the men were not asked to make a statement. The Observer is 10 miles west of Wrightsville on the Lincoln Highway.

June 13, 1966
I had the most strange experi-
ence. As my wife and I were driving 
along, my wife said she saw a bright 
light in the sky. I saw it too, and it 
seemed to be coming nearer and
nearer. As we watched it, it suddenly 
went out. We were so amazed that 
we called my son Richard, who came 
over to our house. He said he saw the
same light, and he said it was an 
unusual experience. 
I have never seen anything
like it before. The light seemed to be
like a basketball, and it was hovering
over the trees. It seemed very close. 
I could not give any explanation
for what we saw, but we all saw it.
Richard said, "And no one can
say we are crazy."
Particular Wero said
I am going to record this experi-
ence, because it is unusual and
something that many people have been
seeing. I think that there are more
people who have seen things like this 
that they do not tell about. I feel 
that I should record this, because
there may be something like this 
happening, that people do not tell
about. If they tell about it, they
are likely to be criticized and made
fun of, as people who say they see
something unusual are often treated.
I should not have to be afraid to tell
about something I have seen, if it is
the truth. The people in this area have
been seeing something like this for
some time, and I feel I should record
this experience, so that if there are
other people who have seen the same
thing, they will know they are not alone.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a scanned document with text. The text seems to be a report or document titled "FAMILY SIGHTS" that provides details about reported UFO sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

FAMILY SIGHTS
Continued from page 8
Reported Feb. 6, 1966, 8:08 p.m., near York, Pa.
Mr. and Mrs. X, their children (12,10, and 7 years old), and a neighbor were outside looking into the sky when they observed a bright light moving slowly and steadily above the horizon. The object, which appeared to be about 20 feet in diameter, was estimated to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. After viewing the object for about 15 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared. According to the witnesses, the object did not make any noise and did not leave any trail.

The lighting did not correspond to any lighting of aircraft we know of.
