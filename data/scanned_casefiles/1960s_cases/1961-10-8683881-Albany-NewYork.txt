Dear Mr. [redacted]

We are going to make this letter very short. So you might as well read it. We have seen an unidentified flying object. It makes a noise like a flying saucer, when it is flying. Then we looked up and saw a star or a planet with some kind of red light. To that we have many witnesses.

PLEASE WRITE US BACK IF YOU FIND OUT WHAT IT IS.
Signed,
[redacted]

P.S. Please send this letter to the U.F.O. if you think it is important.

Before we can make an evaluation of the sighting reported by you and your friends, additional information will be required. I have enclosed several questionnaires with the request that you and your friends complete them and forward in the pre-addressed envelopes.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.
