1. The attached letters received from APRIL and/or May 1963 relate the sighting of an unidentified object over DALLAS and FORT WORTH, TEXAS, amusement park located on 28 May 1963.

2. The objects in the photographic slides are analyzed. Analysis indicates tee slides contain normal photographic effects common to photographic slides above the land body by some type of unknown nature...

3. It is strongly recommended that no further physical analysis be performed, as it is likely the objects photographed are the same as objects described in the attached letters.

4. Should further analysis be desired, additional information concerning the location of the site is necessary, and information regarding the environmental conditions in the vicinity of the site is necessary, as it is apparently a key factor in understanding the nature of the objects photographed.

A. The slides are being returned with this letter per your request.

Dear Captain ******,

The 13 slides, which were forwarded to the Project Technical Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, is an object moving upward and to the left across the sky.
