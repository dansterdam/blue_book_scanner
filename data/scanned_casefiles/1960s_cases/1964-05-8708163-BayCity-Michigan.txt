7. Ayotte. On 25 May, a [redacted], Bay City, Michigan, called this investigator to report that he had seen a light at 0030 moving almost directly overhead, from west to east, taking approximately five minutes to move from straight overhead to its fade-out point in the east. It made no noise, was half the brightness of Jupiter, and every now and then wavered in direction. This is clearly Echo I, the wavering being a practically universal optical illusion. [redacted] emphasized to everyone that he had a small telescope; on questioning, it turned out that he did not actually try to see the object through the telescope.

[redacted] is a student at MSU; Bay City is about 100 miles northeast of Lansing.

7. [redacted] 0030 EST, 25 May 1964. Witness saw light moving from near zenith to horizon, west-east in about 5 minutes. Evaluation: Echo I, Bay City, Michigan.

The rest of the document contains a table with time, location, and observation details from Lansing, Michigan, showing various observations of an object moving southeast at different times and degrees above the horizon on May 18-26.
