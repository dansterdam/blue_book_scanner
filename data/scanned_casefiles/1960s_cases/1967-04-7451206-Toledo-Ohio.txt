Project Blue Book
Attn: Major Hector Quintanilla
Wright Patterson AFB

DEAR SIR:

I am writing you this time not in asking for information, but in reporting to you about a UFO that I saw, along with five other people. This was seen on the night of April 7, 1967, at about 2110 hours.

Initial sighters in our group:
Mar.  (male), 37 years old, Toledo, Ohio 43614
Mr.  (male), 14 years old, Toledo, Ohio 43609 
Mr.  (male), 13 years old, Toledo, Ohio 43614
Mrs.  (female), 48 years old, Toledo, Ohio 43614

The object was first seen 7 April 1967, at 2110 hours.
E.S.T.

At this time we were approximately one hundred yards out of my driveway (which is on Ohio 43609) when I called the others to look at the object. 

The object was in sight for about twenty minutes. I know this because I kept running into the house to tell my mother and come back out. The object seemed to be hovering, no sound was heard. I and five of my friends were outside watching while I was inside.

The object was seen at night. There were many stars visible and the weather was clear. No clouds were visible and the weather was the clearest I have ever seen.

- page 6 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, describing an observation of a UFO sighting.

The object first appeared as one white light and two red lights. The lights were much brighter than the stars, about the size of two periods of 200 yards. The edges of the object were like a star at first, then became more sharply defined. The object was moving at varying degrees of speed, and at one point had one brilliant white light and several smaller red lights. At no time did the object give off smoke or flames. The object descended behind some houses at the end of the sighting.

Text from the document:

The object first appeared as one white light and two red lights. Ten minutes later we viewed it at a range of 25 or 30 degrees behind bino-telescopes and the UFO was apparently solid.

The lights were much brighter than the stars, about the size of a dime at a distance of 200 yards.

The edges of the object were like a star at first, then began to sharpen and they were a little fuzzy. But fairly recognizable as solid edges.

For some time the object was in view. It was moving at varying degrees of speed. At first it had one brilliant white light and several smaller red lights, like a string or scattered, chasing the UFO. I saw it start to take off, watching the object through the binoculars.

At a time did it give off smoke or flames or any sort of propulsion. After it slowed down and started going down the object seemed to hover, the light brightened up once again for the last time.

The only other thing that was noticeable was the size of the object, suggesting when it slowly descended behind some houses.

At no time did it go in front of anything.

The object also, at no time, made any sound that could be distinguished like the distance it was from us. The color of the lights varied which is normal for one's eyes when the object was visible.

The object would have had to have been quite large in diameter judging from the distance it was away from us. When the object was sighted, its speed was estimated 20 MPH - Then it speeded up to well over 100 MPH and would disappear.

When it stopped moving away and started going down, it was about half to three miles from us that I said it was so big.

We first sighted the object while we were traveling north on the Anthony Wayne Trail in our car. Vision was not difficult though, because the weather was clear. We stopped the car and got out at our house and continued to watch the object.

The image does not contain any photographs. The text appears to be a report from Project Blue Book describing a UFO sighting.

After a while I ran into the house and picked up about a 25 to 30 X power hand telescope and we viewed the object through this.
If the object were to be compared with another object towards the east, the sighting of the object would most likely be compared with a weather balloon under no wind currents and slowly losing height. This could have been a weather balloon because 1 was on a television watching a possible balloon.
When we first saw the object it was at about 15 or 17 degrees in a general northwest direction.
The path of the object seemed strange to me because it would disappear completely for a while as it went behind some power wires and buildings and then we would see it again in a slightly different position. But there was one strange thing. The white light kept getting brighter and dimmer as if some mechanism was controlling it.
There was only one object I could see during the entire sighting.
At the time of the sighting, two other people were with me. They both saw the object and we all agree that what we saw was extraordinary. I have read dozens of LIFO sightings. I have talked to people that have seen UFUs but the conclusion was that this was fairly strange. If anyone would care to study this, mentally, on aerial phenomena, I still don't know what it was. Whatever it was, it puzzled me as a man. One was my brother and the other I don't know. My impression is that they think that others might be interested in this report. I might add that this report is made from notes I took at the time of the sighting. I have something describing this and it is as follows:

- page 8 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or document related to a UFO sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

Three days after our sighting was made, I found out we were not the only ones sighting on the same night as ours. I immediately called her and told her description of her sighting. It was as follows: As or her relatives (who were soon to move in with her) sat around the kitchen table, one of them suddenly called her attention to a bright light in the sky. It seemed to be directly overhead and moving quite slowly. She watched it for a while, and then she went into the kitchen for something. When she came back, it was still there, and she watched it for some time. Then it suddenly appeared to go out of sight. She said the object was quite large (about the size of a big full moon) and that it seemed to be rotating or turning as it moved along. This sighting was somewhere around 11:00 P.M. or a little later on the same night as ours. 

I think the thing that impressed me most was the fact that we were not the only ones who had sighted the same or a similar object on the same night. The fact that it was seen by others in a different location but at about the same time, tends to give a certain validity to the sightings. I think that when more than one person sees the same thing, it is more likely to be something real rather than imaginary. 

Three hundred feet up in the air, the object was never over downtown Toledo. After he got this first good look at it, it seemed to be moving away from him in a southeasterly direction from where he was standing. It was quite bright and seemed to be about the size of a big full moon. He said it seemed to be rotating or turning as it moved along. This object was in sight for about 10 or 15 minutes before it went out of sight. When it finally disappeared, it seemed to just fade out and was no longer visible.

I think this would indicate that the object was quite real and not just a figment of the imagination. The fact that it was seen by more than one person at practically the same time and in the same general area tends to give it a certain validity. If it had been just one person seeing it, it might have been easier to dismiss it as just an illusion or imaginary. But when several people see the same thing, it is more likely to be something real. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Toledo, Ohio 43614

TDPR/UFO Maj H Quintanilla, Jr/70916/lab/h Jan 1968

UFO Observation April 7, 1967

Toledo, Ohio h.614

1. Reference your recent correspondence on your unidentified observation of April 7, 1967. Because of the date in receiving your report, we are unable to accomplish a thorough investigation on your sighting.

2. However, we did determine that a specially equipped B-26 was participating in maneuvers over Monroe County, Michigan from late April till July, 1967. This is a very slow moving craft that had two jet engines mounted under the wings and a white pulsating light (20,000 candlepower) mounted bbtl111 at its rear. The glow illuminated the entire fuselage. The aircraft covered a north-south course at a very high altitude, some of its strange lighting and extremely slow speed this aircraft seemed to have served as a training exercise. Most of the April sightings occurred at approximately 9:00 pm and had extremely long duration. Under analysis, we only have second hand information on this incident.

3. At this time it is impossible to determine if the craft was in the Toledo area on the night in question.
