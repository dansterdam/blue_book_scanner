27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

a copy of the report I originally sent you on 21 April '67 is enclosed with shell form. All other information which I feel is pertinent is enclosed in that report. & if I were to write that some report, again today, I would change my opinion slightly on myself and my UFO studies at that time. Today I know it's impossible to tell a good photograph from a phony one without the negative. And secondly, our good study of UFOs can not be made scientifically. Everything has to be written down. I hope by step by step, in the beginning of my typed report, all sightings again have gone up a year.

31 April 1967

Project Blue Book
Attn: Major Hector Quintanilla
Wright Patterson AFB

Dear Sir:

I am writing you this time not in asking for information, but in reporting to you about a UFO that I saw, along with five other people, and two other people (which I did not know about at the time). In a different area.

Initial sighters in our group:
[Names and personal details are redacted]

E.S.T. The object was first seen 7 April 1967, at 2110 hours

At this time we were approximately one hundred yards S.W. of [redacted], Toledo, Ohio 43609 (means of travel: car to foot).

The object was in sight for about twenty minutes. I know this because I kept running into the house to tell my mother and sister about it and there was a clock near the door. The object was in sight continuously because two of my friends were outside watching while I was inside.

The object was seen at night. There were many stars that night but no moon. No clouds were visible and the weather was clear.


- page 6 -

Here is the text from the document:

The object first appeared as one white light and two red ones. Ten minutes later we viewed it with a 25 or 30 power hand telescope and the UFO was apparently solid.

The lights were much brighter than the stars, about like looking into a car headlight from a distance of 200 yards.

The edges of the object were like a star at first, then I looked at it through the telescope and they were a little fuzzy but fairly recognizable as solid edges.

Most of the time while the object was in view it was moving at varying degrees of speed. At first it had one brilliant white light and two dimmer red ones. Then, after the first couple of seconds of watching the UFO, I saw it started to take off, up and away from us. From us, then after red lights disappeared, and the white one stayed, continuing to get brighter and brighter. At no time did it give off smoke or flames of any sort. After the 15th dimed down and the object seemed to hover, the light brightened up once again for the last time.

The only time we lost the object was at the end of the sighting when it slowly descended behind some houses.

At one time the object dropped toward the end of the sighting, behind a tree branch, but came into view again almost immediately.

At no time did it go in front of anything.

The object also, at no time, made any sound that could be distinguishable at the distance it was from us. The color of the object was mostly white except for one time when the object had two adjacent red lights in view.

The object would have had to have been quite large in diameter judging from the distance it was away from us.

When the object was first sighted, its speed was an estimated 20 MPH. Then it speeded up to well over 100 MPH and went up and away from us.

When it stopped moving away and started going down slowly, it was about two and one-half to three miles from us. That is why I said it was 90 bis.

N.E. on the Anthony Wayne Trail in our car. Vision was not distorted though, because the weather was clear. We stopped the car and got out at our house and continued to watch the object.

After a while I ran into the house and picked up about a 25. to 30x power hand telescope and we viewed the object through this.

If the object were to be compared with another object towards the end of the sighting, it would most likely be compared with a weather balloon under no wind currents and slowly losing the air, but it couldn't have been a weather balloon because I checked on balloons in this area and there were none. To my knowledge no other aircraft or crafts could have caused this sighting nor could natural phenomenon.

When we first saw the object it was at about 16 or 17° in a westerly direction. The last we saw of the object it was at about 16° in a general northwest direction.

The path of the object seemed strange to me because it was first going slowly in a northwesterly direction and then increased greatly in speed and went up and away from the first position we saw it. But there was strange thing. The white light kept getting brighter and brighter instead of dimming out.

There was only one object I could see during the entire sighting.

At the time of the sighting, two other people were with me. They both saw the object and all agree on what we saw was roughly one sighting. By experience in sighting UFO's next to zero, except for this one sighting. I have read a lot about UFO sightings. I have talked to people that have been them and, from the good solid cases, I have heard the crackpots from the good solid cases. I have seen dozens of pictures of UFO's and I can believe that I can tell fakes from documented pictures. I have read what I think to be a fairly thorough study, mentally, on aerial phenomena. I still don't know what I saw and I wish somebody had some answers. The other two sighters were puzzled as I am. One was my brother and the other is [redacted] (he is mentioned in the beginning of this letter).

My wife first noticed the object and was first alighted, and only glimpsed the object or light at the stop light at Woodsdale and the Anthony Wayne Trail. My mother saw it part of the way to our home. Both agree that it appeared very unusual and did not appear to be a star, a plane, or a balloon, even with the short look they had.

The other four sighters, along with myself, agree on everything in this report. I might add that this report has made from notes I took on the night of the sighting. I have something detrimental to add to this report and it is as follows:


- page 8 -

Three days after our sighting was made, I found out from one of my relatives that her neighbor-in-law had made a sighting on the same night as ours. I immediately called her up to find out more about her sighting. Her description of her sighting is as follows: (name remains anonymous) called her on the phone and told her she could see a UFO if she looked out her front window. She did this and immediately noticed a UFO two to three times brighter than the stars (she referred to the sky as heavens). She told me the lights were a lot brighter than stars and they were closer than stars. She said it didn't move at all, 16 just hovered there.

After she watched it for awhile, she went into the kitchen for a couple of seconds and when she came back it was gone. This all happened on the same night we saw our UFO. I also found out from this same relative that a Mr. [redacted] of [redacted], Ohio, had seen an object that Friday night when we saw ours. I called him on the phone also, and he told me the whole story. He was starting in his yard which he noticed an object of enormous size coming. In his direction out of the sky. It was glowing and whitish red colored. It kept coming toward him. He will go or a week if needed to be gone. Then he noticed it wasn't gone at all, 16 hours were just gone. It appeared as a shadow for awhile, then its lights came back on. At this time he observed what might be three times the size of a football field. It hovered for awhile then took off in a southeasterly direction from where he was.

It seemed at that he thought to be a true 16 or 17 miles up and away. When it stopped climbing, he estimated the object to be hovering directly over downtown Toledo. After he got tired of watching, it slowly quit watching its southerly close. It seems very likely to me that after he quit watching the object we came along and saw it about one mile most of downtown Toledo. From where he was and from where we were, our directions would be reversed and put his object in or near the place where we first saw ours.

Mr. [redacted] is a very cautious and careful man. Always with a notebook and he seemed to know a great deal about modern day aircraft and about the lights that should or should not carry. I'm sorry this is not as good a story than I'd like, but I took awhile to prepare and revise it to the best of my ability.

Thank you.

An answer to what we have seen would be appreciated.

Sincerely,
Toledo, Ohio 43614

UFO Observation April 7, 1967

Toledo, Ohio 43614

1. Reference your recent correspondence on your unidentified observation of April 7, 1967. Because of the late date in receiving your report, we are unable to accomplish a thorough investigation on your sighting.

2. However, we did determine that a specially equipped B-26 was participating in a flight test program over Monroe County, Michigan from late April till July, 1967. This is a very slow moving craft that had two red helicopter landing lights in nose and a white helicopter landing light (20,000 candlepower) mounted mainly on the right-hand side. The craft operated from Findlay, Ohio and on its mission flew almost directly north into Michigan because of its strange lighting and extremely slow speed this aircraft caused several UFO sightings. Most of the April sightings occurred at approximately 9:00 pm and had extremely long durations. Unfortunately, we only have second hand information on these sightings.

3. At this time it is impossible to determine if the craft was in the Toledo area on the night in question.
