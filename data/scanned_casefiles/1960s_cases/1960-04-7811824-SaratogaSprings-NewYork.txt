40 deg elev, disapp 150 deg at 15 deg elev, continued steady ave below tree 
line, seen for 2 to 3 minutes.

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. Poss an act

Other Insufficient Data ( 3 witness )

Evaluation of Source Reliability Poss reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: It was unknown to the reporting official if there 
was any aircraft in the area of the sighting. There are similar routes over 
the Winnebago location, therefore it is possible that he witnessed an act 
flying along one of those airways. However, the presence of such an act is 
unknown. Due to the lack of such info and other corroborating witnesses, this 
report is evaluated as insufficient data, 3 witness.
