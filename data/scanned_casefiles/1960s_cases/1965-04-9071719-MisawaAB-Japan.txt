5. Misawa RAPCON officers could discern no special pattern to the tracks of the unidentified targets, other than that they frequently (but not always) converged on the Misawa runway (or possibly toward the 692d Security Wing's Allenwebber antenna array). The targets broke off before passing directly over the base. No record was maintained of the exact tracks. From the general description, the tracks are what might be expected if radial and tangential antenna patterns measured some bearing obtained by (or from) an aircraft working in conjunction with (or against) ground equipment at Misawa. However, investigation to date has not disclosed any antenna pattern mission schedules during this period, nor would such missions explain the occasional presence of multiple targets.

6. (U) In addition to the incidents on 10, 11, and 12 April described in the initial UFO report, similar unidentified targets were observed on 14 April. The targets were seen on eight occasions on the latter date, four times on both the search and precision radar, in one instance, four targets were visible simultaneously, and in another instance, two targets were present.

7. (U) Any additional data which might clarify the identity of the targets will be forwarded as it becomes available.

2nd Ind. (TDEW/Capt Dunlap/pkj/74236)                                  7 May 65

TO:    TDEW/UFO

1.     Evaluation of the Misawa AB, Japan, UFO Report indicates that the probable cause was anomalous propagation: Radar echoes obtained from regions of the atmosphere where no apparent reflecting source exists, commonly referred to as "angels," can usually be attributed to various causes; i.e., birds, insects, and meteorological effects. In this instance, the reports support anomalous propagation.

2.     Anomalous propagation occurs when the radiated radar beam is bent, by refraction or reflection, to the ground. The echoes return to the radar by the same path. The radar actually sees the ground or some object on the ground as a target. An apparent moving target is observed if the beam illuminates a moving object or even when the beam illuminates a stationary object on the ground if the reflecting portion of the atmosphere is itself in motion. It has been reported that a range of 50 miles a horizontal reflecting layer rising 3 meters per second could cause an apparent echo to move at 300 miles per hour. This appears to be the only likely technical explanation for the target speeds observed in this report.

3.     Lack of tangible evidence does allow the existence of other plausible causes. If so possible that shipborne or ground-based sources accidentally or intentionally caused the appearance of the seemingly nonexistent targets. However, as pointed out in Det 4, FTD letter (U) "Supplement to UFO Report," 4 May 1965, it is unlikely that two radars operating at different frequencies would observe a false target. Consideration of the available evidence, however, tends to support anomalous propagation as the cause.

1/Lt. David J. Vaughan, Chief Targets Branch, 39th Air Division. The statement by Capt. Seymire (attachment #1) covers the facts of the sighting in a very precise manner and I can add to this. However, the sighting were again made on the 11th at approximately the same time (see statement, attachment #3). On 12 April 65, 12002 similar sightings were again encountered. The B-52 involved and F-102 from the 5th for 31, and while he was known to be in the area, the pool could not have any valid explanation. It appears the sightings on the radar were caused by an unknown weather condition or phenomena.

SIGHTING ON APRIL 10:

At approximately 1130Z, Trap 02, a T-39 was on base leg to runway 28, approximately 6 1/2 miles out. At this time I observed a target on the FAR, at 4 miles, 1000 feet preceding Northeast. I took control of Trap 02 and turned him on FAR 1 5 3/4 miles. The target heading Northeast went off the FAR scan. As Trap 02 came on in, another target came on the FAR from the Southwest. The target reflection was larger than the T-39, and traveled at approximately 175 kts. When the target was 1/4 mile from Trap 02, he veered to the right and passed off the left wing of 02, slightly above him. The target continued eastward and climbed to approximately 280 feet and disappeared. By this time Trap 02 was approximately 3 1/4 miles out on final approach, and another target came from the Southwest and turned outbound centerline at 2 1/2 miles altitude 1000 feet. I attained a close of Trap 02 and he said he couldn't see a thing. The target continued on a collision course and passed directly over 02, approximately 200 feet above him. Both targets prepared the size of a Flight of 2 century type A/C and varied in speed from 150 to 200 kts. Upon landing, the pilot of Trap 02, Capt Odis, and another officer came to the RAPCON to observe the targets, which were now on FAR and ASR at the same points. Both officers, Msgt Williams, also invoke, and a 30 stood observed the targets on FAR and ASR. Also the three above mentioned enlisted men observed the targets in relation to Trap 02 while he was on final approach. Capt Warrine was notified and came to the RAPCON with another officer, and both observed the targets on FAR and ASR. By this time the targets were more numerous on the ASR and FAR scan in all quadrants of the scope, most of them within 6 miles of the field. Also at this time a large ship was noted on FAR, 5 miles out in the ocean, proceeding north. The targets were track on 11-NORMAL, and a mixture of both. They could be seen with VR on FAR, and with VR on or near the general track of the targets. The targets Southwest-Northeast, although they traveled in all directions, but seldom came directly over the field. Later it was noted a large ship made a right turn and came back across the FAR scan, southbound, and stopped 9 1/2 miles out, directly in line with the runway centerline. The ship steadily maintained a course of 45 minutes to an hour, and then proceeded very slowly to the south. By this time Col Daman and Lt Day were in the facility and both observed the targets and the ship. There were low hanging clouds visible on the FAR, from 8 miles on out, but no precipitation below 2000 feet was visible. Forecast period was visual sightings, but it report hazy conditions to the east. At the time of the initial occurrence, I checked Hackenberg, Chitose, Saratoga, JCLS, and Tokyo for traffic in the area. None was reported. I checked weather for inverter, or rapid temperature changes, none had occurred. I had maintenance check the radar. It appeared normal. They could see the targets, but could not explain them. The targets on ASR appeared to be two A/C in close formation. All leaving a trail on the scope. This is my third instance of such phenomena, and each instance the targets could have been detrimental to the specific mission for that day. Possibly a coincidence, possibly not.

SIGHTINGS ON APRIL 11:

11 April 1965, approximately 21:40 local, I observed targets in the vicinity of Misawa AB. These targets appeared on the ASR radar between the ranges of 2 and 6 miles from the base. These targets were in the Southwest-Southeast (Due East) quadrants. The strength of these targets was 3. The tracks and headings of each varied. There were no formation type targets. All appeared to be single returns.

The total number of targets was 9 on ASR and 1 on PAR. The period of time was from approximately 2140 local to 2157 local. The target observed on PAR was strength 4 on both elevation and azimuth. The target on PAR broke off over the approach wires and had started at approximately 6 miles out from left of course. There was no reported traffic known to any agency. Two ships were observed before, during and after this occurrence. Personnel in RAPCON witnessing this were:

TSgt Seaitz
A2B Hendrickson
A3C Woody
A1C Ruppert (Radar Maint)

Tower could not see any visible targets when given bearings and distances.

1. (U) Reference 39IDC letter, "UFO Report," dated 19 April, forwarded to FTD by Hq 5AF (SFIGO), pertaining to UFO observed 10-11 April 65 on GCA radar at Misawa AB. Following supplementary information obtained from Capt. Lester D. Waymire, 1953d Communications Squadron (RAPCON), who observed the incidents.

2. (U) The objects were observed on both GPN-16 (S-band) and FPN-16 (X-band) GCA radars. When the objects were in position to be observed by both radars, both radars reflected the targets at identical positions. The GPN-16 FRR was 1500 pps, and the FPN-16 PRF was 1833 pps. Thus, it seems unlikely that the objects were electronically generated false targets. Maximum and minimum ranges at which the targets appeared and faded were compatible with the radars' normal range and altitude capabilities (GPN-16 range against small low-flying aircraft is about 20 NM; FPN-16 maximum altitude capability 3000 feet). However, 39ADCC advised that AG & W sites (i.e. nearest being about 35NM northwest) detected no targets which could be equated with those observed by Misawa GCA.

3. (U) The presence of ships a few miles off shore during the incidents is not considered unusual; Hachinohe, just south of Misawa, is a busy port, and more often than not a ship is inbound or outbound about Misawa. Also, a very popular fishing hole is only a few miles out from Misawa on the runway's azimuth.

4. (U) Although the unidentified targets most often were initially detected near mountains (3000 to 4000 feet) located 15 NM west of Misawa, and winds were generally out of the west, the targets (1400-2400 knots) and various headings (including alter headings) argue against their being wind-borne. Atmospheric conditions during which targets were observed varied from very gruff weather with low overcast, to CAVU. Temperature inversion was suspected on one date but not on others. Failures of known aircraft: in the area to make visual contact with targets does not completely rule out existence of visible targets; the initial attempt at observation (10 April) by aircraft on final approach was in bad weather, and on 12 April when an F-102 was scrambled to attempt contact, the targets were not within the precision radar's scan and no altitude could be ascertained. All incidents occurred at night.
