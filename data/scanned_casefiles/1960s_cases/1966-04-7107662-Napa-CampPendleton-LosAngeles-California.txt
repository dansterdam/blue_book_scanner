They returned outside and at this time the object appeared to have taken a solid roundish shape, with one trailing edge. The trailing edge was pointing eastward. They observed the object in this position for a period of approximately 5 to 10 minutes, and while observed, it changed to a "tear drop" shape, and stayed in this shape until approximately 0510 hours, when it could no longer be seen due to the oncoming daylight. This object was sighted by approximately 7 members of the Duty Section of the Military Police Company.

Dear Sir:

After reading an article on "U.F.O. Park. Article for Vandenberg" in April 25 issue of the Lawnay Record, I learned like to report that on April 20, about 4:30 A.M. I observed a green or blue-green "cloud" or luminous mass. It moved from east to west and had a definite shape that did not change as it moved.

There was also a white light that disappeared as I watched.

Ref: (a) Provost Marshal's Office, MCRD, Camp Pendleton Memo of 21 Apr 1966, s/s

1. At approximately 1030, 21 April 1966 NISRA, Camp Pendleton was informed by the Criminal Investigation Section of the Provost Marshal's Office, MCRD, Camp Pendleton of the report of an unidentified flying object at Camp Pendleton. The subsequent paragraph will reflect verbatim the contents of the memo as reflected in reference (a).

2. "At approximately 0745 hours, 21 April 1966, upon being notified that a member of the Provost Marshal's office Duty Section, observed an "unidentified flying object", SGT J. EASTERBROOK, 1574093, USMC, an investigator from the Criminal Investigation Section, interviewed the Provost Marshal's Office Desk Sergeant, Staff SGT M. A. MOAK, 1137233, USMCR Military Police Company, Service Battalion, Headquarters Regiment, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California. Staff SGT MOAK related that at approximately 0420 hours, 21 April 1966, he had received notification by radio from a Patrol Unit that there was a large, pale green, fluorescent object hanging in the sky over the Lake O'Neill area. Staff SGT MOAK then went outside to the upper parking lot adjacent to Building 1231 and observed the object, which he described as being a "horseshoe shape", pale fluorescent green in color with two trailing edges; the center of the object was a big, roundish shape. At this time the object appeared to be spinning in a circular motion, and staying in one position.

He estimates the size of the object as 15 to 20 feet in length, 10 to 12 feet in width, and was observed on a bearing of 327 degrees northwest from the fork in the white traffic line adjacent to the southwest corner of Building 1231.

Staff SGT MOAK stated that it was very difficult to estimate the elevation or distance of the object; however, he would guess that it was 1500 to 2000 feet in elevation, and appeared to be approximately 1½ (1-1½) miles away. Upon sighting the object, Staff SGT MOAK returned to the Desk Sergeants area and
