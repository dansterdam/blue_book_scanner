(3) SATELLITES
1. Report similar to a/c observation. The duration not included.
Also radar return likely in case of a/c. Insufficient Data.
2. Likely 1/6, 3. Probable Satellite(NON-EVAL CON'T)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
1. 05/14/64, 2 objects East to West, high speed, 1st mag
maintaining close proximity with each other 1b) 35 minutes
later same or identical objects returned. Radar to Radar.
Visual observation without Radar return.

2. Three objects reported as a/c observed by lookout with EX.
1st object, 1st wing, other two reported as 2d mag, Towing
toward ship at high speed. Four minutes later Radar contact
established. Radar range 22 mile, held for 6 minutes. Tracks
confirmed visually and corresponded with Radar track. Hovered
overhead for 3 minutes. Course changed and erratic movement with
speed reported as 3,000 knots. IFF challenge not returned.

MEMO ROUTING SLIP

TO: Maj. Quintanilla, FTD

REMARKS:
Per Telecon Sgt Jones and Myself on 14 May 65, I would Appreciate any thoughts or comments you might have on this.

N/R on 28 May Sgt Moody returned Capt Robinson request for our opinion of the report. Informed that A/C was the most likely causes. Data too incomplete and conflicting for analysis. Duration and speed reported incompatible. Range and visual characteristics as viewed through EK also not known. Para 3 believed to be Satellites (NOT ECHO I or IT) and we do not have Equatorial crossings, azimuth, or other data. Without additional data, all we can do is speculate.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (U)

1. AT 051145Z, IN POSITION 20-54N1 135-30E2, COURSE 265, SPEED 13,
ODD AND ALL BRIDGE PERSONNEL SIGHTED TWO FLYING OBJECTS PASSING FROM
EAST TO WEST AT EXTREMELY HIGH SPEEDS. OBJECTS WERE OF FIRST MAGNITUDE,
AND MAINTAINED CLOSE RELATIVE POSITIONS, APPROXIMATELY (THIRTY FIVE)
MINUTES LATER THE SAME, OR IDENTICAL OBJECTS RETURNED, PASSING WEST
TO EAST, AGAIN AT EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED. OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED VISUALLY
BY ALL BRIDGE PERSONNEL, BUT WERE NOT HELD ON RADAR, ALTITUDE NOT
DETERMINED.

2. AT 060910Z, IN POSITION 20-22N6 135-50E4, COURSE 265, SPEED 15,
LEADING SIGNALMAN REPORTED WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT, BEARING
ODD POSITION ANGLE 21, WHEN VIEWED THROUGH BINOCULARS. THREE OBJECTS
WERE SIGHTED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER. ONE OBJECT WAS FIRST
MAGNITUDE, THE OTHER TWO SECOND MAGNITUDE. OBJECTS WERE TRAVELLING AT
EXTREMELY HIGH SPEEDS, MOVING TOWARD THE SHIP AT AN UNDETERMINED
ALTITUDE, AT 09142 FOUR MOVING TARGETS WERE DETECTED ON THE SPS-6C
AIR SEARCH.

RADAR AT RANGES UP TO 22 MILES AND HELD UP TO SIX MINUTES.
WHEN OVER THE SHIP, THE OBJECTS SPREAD TO CIRCULAR FORMATION DIRECTLY
OVERHEAD, AND REMAINED THERE FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES. THIS
MANEUVER WAS OBSERVED BOTH VISUALLY AND BY RADAR. THE BRIGHTER OBJECT
WHICH HOVERED OFF THE STARBOARD QUARTER MADE THE LARGER PRESENTATION
ON THE RADAR SCOPE. THE OBJECTS WERE SEVERAL COURSE CHANGES DURING
THE SIGHTING, CONFIRMED VISUALLY AND BY RADAR, AND WERE TRACKED AT
SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF THREE THOUSAND KNOTS. CHALLENGES WERE MADE BY TFF,
BUT NO ANSWER. AFTER THE THREE MINUTE HOVERING MANEUVER, THE OBJECTS
