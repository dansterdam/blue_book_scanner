SUBJECT: Extract from Duty Officers Report

TO: TDGN

The following, extracted from Capt Hartke's OD Report dated 27 Jul 64,
is issued for your information:

"2150 hours, UFO report from Mr. [redacted]
2155 hours, UFO report from Mrs. [redacted]

0027 hours, Received call from Maj Cottrell at USAF. He received
this message. At 0025 Maj Burgess at ATC command post passed this UFO
report. Mrs. [redacted] called Laredo AFB to report an object passing
South to North at a high rate of speed. It was similar to a star but
larger and very bright. The sighting took place at 23 July, 0246hrs. Two
air policemen A/3C Patterson and A/1C Creech also observed object, but
would give no estimate of speed to the Duty Officer.

0031 hours, Maj Cottrell called and said that NORAD stated the object
was 5610 KM satellite.

Is it possible to furnish the OD with a forecast of satellites which
may be observed in the Dayton area?"
