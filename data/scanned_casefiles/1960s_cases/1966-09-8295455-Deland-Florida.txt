Supplemental Information

The young lady appeared very sincere when she was questioned about her sighting. She did indicate that she was very poor in estimating heights and distances and was very hesitant to provide this information. I had to encourage her several times to make an estimate.

The course or identity cannot be ascertained at this time. The local police station did not receive any reports of a UFO. Cape Kennedy did not launch any missiles during that time of evening. Although Sanford Naval Air Station had aircraft flying that night, Operations Officer doubted if inbound or landing traffic would have any of their aircraft over the vicinity of Deland. The local airport shutdown operations after 1600 hours daily. New Smyrna Beach Coast Guard confirmed a clear night and light winds and no reports of UFOs.

Summary: A clear night and no obstructions to visibility could rule out a weather phenomena, but it does not completely rule out low flying, unexplained aircraft proceeding to Sanford Naval Station, McCoy Airport, Orlando, Fla. or Jacksonville Fla Naval Air Station, or commercial airport. Miss sighted the UFO approximately 2200 hours, 21 Sep 66, but was not reported until 0930 hours 26 Sep 66. She was hesitant about reporting any scores for fear of fellow students thinking her "nutty". At the time of the sighting, she was sitting in a vehicle with a male companion (student) smoking a cigarette. When she saw the object, she said the car can told her companion to look, but he did not see it. He said he had looked much higher in the sky than she was pointing.
