ITEM
Request for UFO Information

Wisconsin Wing, Civil Air Patrol
Auxiliary of the United States Air Force
Airman's Command Division
ATTN: Lt Col Charles E. Clapp, Commander

1. Reference the attached letter from Lt Col Michael J. Amato, CAP, dated 11 March 1966, requesting investigation of UFO reports.
APR 2002 covers the reporting of UFO information to the Air Force. This regulation is what prompted this request by Lt Col Amato. 
Air Force has procedures for investigating UFO sightings.

2. Requests for information have the Marinette policeman submit his report directly to the nearest Air Force Base for action.

3. We feel it would be beneficial in identifying UFO sightings to have the information on AFRTS given in Paragraph 1 for this investigation as the procedure on Project Blue Book which describes the program on identification of flying objects is being followed.

ERIC T. CONKRIGHT, Colonel, USAF

WISCONSIN WING, CIVIL AIR PATROL
AUXILIARY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
P.O. BOX 319, 700 SOUTH FIFTH STREET
WATERTOWN, WISCONSIN 53094

2 April 1966

Colonel James E. Gates, Commander
Wisconsin Wing - Civil Air Patrol
700 S. 12th Street
Watertown, Wisconsin 53094 

Dear Colonel Gates:

I had a Marinette policeman call me Wednesday evening, March 
30th at 8:55 p.m. and report an unidentified flying object.
The object was sighting at an altitude of something
above 5,000 feet. The object had rotating red and green lights
and other colors and seemed to be moving up, down, sideways,
backwards and forwards as well as forward. It flew in a general
southwesterly and southeastly direction.

The sighting was by a Marvin Erdmann, a patrolman of the
Marinette City Police Department.

He had attended church at St. James Lutheran Church in
Marinette and the observation was made by a fireman and by the police man.

The man did not know where to report the UFO,so he called
me, apparently at the suggestion of someone.

I frankly do not know where these reports should be made, that is,
whether they should be made to the nearest Air Force base or
Area Commander, etc. Perhaps, it would be well to determine
this and issue instructions to the wing membership in your next
wing bulletin as to where these items might be reported and
what data should be reported with them.

Very sincerely yours,

Michael J. Asuata
Lt. Col. - CAP
Commander, Area One
Wisconsin Wing
