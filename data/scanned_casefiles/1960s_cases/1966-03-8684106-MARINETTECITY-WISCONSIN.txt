1. Reference the attached letter from Lt. Col. Michael J. Amata, 
CAP, dated 2 April 1966, regarding unidentified flying objects. 
AFR 200-2 covers the reporting of UFO information to the Air Force. 
This regulation states that reports should be made to the nearest 
Air Force Base for investigation.

2. Request you have the Marinette policeman submit his report 
directly to the nearest Air Force Base for action.

3. We feel it would be beneficial in identifying UFO sightings 
by including the information on AFR 200-2, in paragraph 1 of this 
letter, in your Wing Bulletin. Also attached for your information 
is the brochure on Project Blue Book which describes the program 
on unidentified flying objects to date.

Dear Colonel Gates:

I had a Marinette policeman call me Wednesday evening, March 30th at 8:55 p.m. and report an unidentified flying object.

The object was flying south at an altitude of something above 5,000 feet. The object had rotating red and green lights and other colors and seemed to be moving up, down, sideways, backwards and forwards as well as forward. It flew in a general southwesterly and southerly direction.

The sighting was by a Marvin Erdmann, a patrolman of the Marinette City Police Department.

He had attended church at St. James Lutheran Church in Marinette and the observation was made after the church, by a fireman and by the police man.

The man did not know where to report the UFO, so he called me, apparently, at the suggestion of someone.

I frankly do not know where these reports should be made, that is, whether they should be made to the nearest Air Force base or Area Commander, etc. Perhaps, it would be well to determine this and issue instructions to the Wing membership in your next Wing bulletin as to where these items might be reported and what data should be reported with them.

Very sincerely yours,

Michael J. Acuba
Lt. Col. - CAP
Commander, Area One
