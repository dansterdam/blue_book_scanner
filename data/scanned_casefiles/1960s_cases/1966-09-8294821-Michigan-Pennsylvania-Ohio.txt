1. [Redacted] W-P AFB, Ohio

2. Between Yellow Springs & Clifton, Ohio in Clark County (in John Bryan Park, Boy Scout Camp) (39°07'30"N - 83°52'30"W)

3. 17 September 1966, approximately 2000 hours EST

4-5. Object seen in northern hemisphere traveling from the east to the west. Using Polaris as a reference, object traveling from the east did not quite reach Polaris but to about 10° of Polaris. Are traveled was about 200 (i.e. from 30° east to about 10° east)

6. Height of object, apparently traveling slightly downward noted to be 30° to 40° above the horizon.

7. Height did not change appreciably when object disappeared, about 10°.

8-9. It did not pass overhead, but was 30° to 40° above the horizon or 30°-30°-60° from zenith.

10. It did not reach the horizon. Horizon was clear since ahead were open fields and the area is relatively flat to the north from point of observation.

11. The flight path angle is estimated at 10° to the horizon.

12. The low angle of observation can only be related to Polaris as noted.

13. No explosion.

14. Flight duration - approximately four seconds

15. No train was left, or at least noted. The brilliance of the basic body glow was so great that a small trail would not be noticeable. After glow disappeared nothing was noted in the sky as remains or debris.

16. None noted.

17. No sound.

18. Color orange-yellow, of sufficient brilliance to light the area with a glow.

19. The largest over observed. Other meteors noted to be the size of walnuts, this appeared to be about the size of a small grapefruit held at five feet. The moon, by the same comparison, would be about 2 - 4 times larger.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDESR/V. D. Bryant/mJb/70h01/6 Oct 66

SUBJECT: Evaluation of 17 September 66 UFO Sighting

TO: TDESR

1. There is insufficient information pertaining to the radar sighting to allow a detailed evaluation to be made. However, in view of the fact that the time of this sighting (which appears to be an approximation) is given as 010002, and the large meteor sighting in the Michigan area (seen in a number of northeastern states) occurred at 000152, a logical assumption can be made that the two occurrences are one and the same.

2. Many articles have been written confirming the fact that missiles, meteors, etc., frequently leave an ionized path or wake which has a very large radar echo area, and hence would provide a sizeable radar return. This ionized cloud may have been the target(s) which were seen from 7500 to 8500 ft. on the height finder.

THE GREAT FIREBALL OF 1966 SEPTEMBER 17
A.M.S. No. 2091

On this date a remarkable fireball or bolide appeared at about 7:52 p.m., E.S.T. It was seen from as far west as Wisconsin, cent for many places in New York, Pennsylvania and Canada, and the light of the explosion(?) as far south as Roanoke, Va., though from there the body was below the horizon. Its brilliancy was excessively great and it left a long enduring train visible from considerable distance.

One of our very active A.M.S. members, Wm. Werner, West Chester, Ohio, observed it and at once began gathering reports. Later reports from Sky and Telescope, Wright-Patterson A.F.B., Adler Planetarium, and other institutions, as well as from many individuals, arrived. To all who reported we are most grateful. Perhaps the total was 70. At first glance, it appeared that for once almost a perfect solution could be obtained, as a number plotted the path on A.M.S. charts and other drew diagrams with respect to stars. However, when the azimuth lines were plotted on the usual regional chart for beginning point and end for end point, immediately it appeared that there were serious errors in some reports. The fact that it was not fully dark in most areas made plotting difficult. To be brief, during the following months, no less than four complete diagrams were prepared and much work done on obtaining which further data and study was made to correct these. The solution here given is the best that the writer can derive from the data in his hands. Four Canadian reports came, one only giving usable data for both beginning and end heights. As the body began over southwestern Ontario, this lack of more complete reports was serious. Had all the plotted paths been correct, even approximately, when reported on a single chart, their projections would have given the radiant. With this derived, the rest would have been much easier. But the many plots did not give even an approximate radiant. Hence the solution had to depend entirely on reported azimuths and altitudes. Eventually the most probable sub-beginning point and sub-end point were fixed. Next the observed altitudes, corrected for curvature, gave a series of heights for the beginning and end points. It is notorious that most observers tend to overestimate altitudes for 30° or over. Hence those of 35° or more are practically useless, and were discarded. The beginning height was 114 ± 21 km. In addition, there were 9 points scattered along the path, mostly about midway, which very roughly gave 84 km. This probably is the point at which the fireball flared to greatest brilliancy. The projected path was 204 km long, the true path 226 km.

The rest of the text continues but becomes slightly illegible towards the bottom of the page.

White Lights Sky
N.Y. to Illinois

Romney Thought
He Was Attacked

A meteorite lightened skies over much of the eastern part of the nation tonight, and a flaming chunk fell off and dropped into a soybean field near Marion, Ind.

The meteorite prompted a flood of telephone calls to police as it streaked across skies from New York to Illinois. There were reports it fell to earth in rough country near Huntsville, Ont.

Michigan Gov. George Romney, who was flying in his private plane to St. Clair, Mich., said the meteorite came close to his craft and lighted the sky as "bright as noon."

"We thought we were under attack," Romney said.

Hundreds of people throughout the northern part of the Miami valley (Ohio) flocked to sheriff's offices and police and sheriff's departments with calls that they had seen a bright object in the northeast skies.

"IT WAS a tremendous thing," said George Otto, 268 light Rd., Dayton. "I thought at may have been a rose comes and I was ready to duck."

Otto described the object as green then fading out to yellow.

"I've seen a lot of meteors," said another caller, "but I've never seen anything like that before."

JOSEPH MOORE, 142 Edgewood, said he was driving when he saw something "light up and fall at about a 45-degree angle. It had a tail about 1,000 feet long. At first I thought it was a plane, then it turned to a greenish red and finally was all red and orange when it disappeared."

The object was sighted around 7:45 p.m. Many calls were said from Wright-Patterson Air Force base to search some of the counties to the north after reports that fragments may have landed.

THE CHAMPAIGN COUNTY sheriff's office reported that the meteor was believed to have landed in the area disclosed nothing but a dump on fire.

The local weather bureau said they had no information on the object.

"From its height and the pears it is to be a wrecker," said the U.S. Weather observer at the Greater Pittsburgh airport.

AIR FORCE Officers at Wright-Patterson Air Force base said they had received several calls from area residents about the object but declined to say where the debris believed it originated.

The FAA said the bright light was seen by several airline pilots.

Burning fragments plunked down in a farm field near the tiny town of Sweester, Ind., where witnesses said (they) were several minutes before flickering out.

ONE REPORT said the fragments "were big as a house."

In Caro, Mich., a deputy sheriff said "We've had reports from all over the area about small fires on the ground, explosions on the ground and over the lake and pieces and lights raining down."

In Chicago, the chief meteorologist at the Adler planetarium described the incident as a bolide or exploding meteor.

PIECES of the object fell on the Wayne Glasburn farm near Sweester. A number smoldering chunks were within 20 feet of each other, eyewitnesses reported. They were described as about 114 feet in circumference.

In Canada, the provincial police reported an object fell to the ground near Huntsville, Ont., about 100 miles east of Toronto.

SMITHSONIAN INVESTIGATING

Did Meteorite Fall Here?

By WALTER RYBECK

WASHINGTON, Sept. 19—This week, before a spectacular fireball identified as an exploding meteorite flashed across the eastern United States, including southwest Ohio, a Smithsonian Institution meteorologist was trying to unravel the mystery of a meteorite that allegedly fell on Dayton in 1882 or 1885.

E. P. Henderson, a research associate in the division of meteorology is skeptical that, as reported to the Smithsonian, the specimen fell on the Montgomery county fairgrounds with such force that it penetrated the ground about four feet and was still hot when recovered.

"Even 75 years ago, Dayton was a flourishing city, so that you might expect many of such a fall to have found its way into scientific literature," Henderson said.

"I DO NOT QUESTION the integrity of L. R. Keyser who, as a University of Cincinnati student in 1881, sent us the iron. He probably reported the story as passed down through the years by his family," Henderson said.

Because the specimen "definitely is a meteorite, a unique one, a scientifically very important sample," Henderson is especially anxious to nail down the facts of its origin.

He was delighted to learn, through The Daily News, that E. J. Koester, director of the Dayton Museum of Natural History, has agreed to help the Smithsonian try to get an accurate account of the meteorite—a 58-pound hunk of iron, triangular in shape, about 12 inches in its longest dimension.

ASSOCIATE CURATOR of Meteorology Roy Clarke and Henderson said unusual features include a fairly high nickel content and unusual crystal structure. Tests have shown it contained gases known to be cosmic in origin.

Koester said his staff will check Dayton newspapers of the 1880s and 1890s and talk with astronomers and old-timers who might recall a meteorite fall of that era.

Henderson was added zeal in deciphering the scientific puzzle because he is an Ohioan, born near Columbus in 1888. Although he recently retired, officially, Clarke said Henderson still works as actively as ever, and was called on to explain Saturday night's phenomenon.

CLARKE SAID 10 reports of meteorite falls—mostly in Indiana—have yet to be substantiated, although the fireball explosion was "the kind of event that does produce specimens."

The interest of meteorites has grown tremendously because of new studies in space. This could account for the fact that the Smithsonian is just getting around to verifying the "fairground" specimen, plus the tremendous numbers awaiting study.

Until recently, Henderson was the only scientist at the Smithsonian working on meteorites and he had other duties as well. Now there are curators, chemists, electronic engineers, geologists and others concentrating on this field.

A search in the Hoffmeister-von Nicol Catalogue gives several fireballs of about same date and similar radiant. These are:

No. 338           1899 Sept. 8     greater V     R.A.     Dec.
345               1875 Sept. 14    great         348      +3

575               1914 Sept. 8     3 x V         347      +3

When we remember that probably not one fireball in a hundred has its orbit computed, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a stream of meteoroids furnishing fireballs whose radiant lie near the celestial equator and 5° to 15° west of vernal equinox. Evidently the radiant of the 1966 fireball fits in quite well.

It is understood that Prof. V. D. Chamberlain, Abrams Planetarium, East Lansing, Mich., will publish a paper on this fireball based upon very extensive data from presumably different reports.

FIREBALL of 1967 April 5.52 G.M.T.
A.M.S. No. 2392

This brilliant fireball appeared on the above date at 7:34 p.m. E.S.T. It seems to have started about 10 miles S.W. of Rochester, N.Y. and ended above a point very near Batria, Ontario. It is believed that the sub-end point is quite accurate, the sub-beginning less certain. The solution depends on 8 reports from this side and 24 reports from Canadian side. All but one of the first lot were sent me by H. E. Roth, Project Director, Volunteer Flight Network, National Air lines, and the 24 Canadian by Bruce A. McIntosh, National Research Council, Ottawa, Canada. But for the invaluable help of both, no solution would be possible. We received only one report from a ground observer in New York, and two thirds of the Canadian were from Ottawa or near by.

The reports from airline pilots fortunately were from widely scattered points, giving its color as green. Venus was near its end point for most Canadian observers and most take that the fireball was far brighter. Also two may that it was brighter than Moon, one that it was equal, one that its magnitude lay between that of Moon and Venus.

Probably about -10 would be near the truth. No long-enduring train was left. Both Venus and a belt of Orion served as reference points. Observers at a distance estimated the fireball's length as 45°, with a reference point of 48° and obviously importantly great, there was a train preceding the bright point. Retaining estimates less than 45°, H1 is 121 km, H2 is 81 km, based upon 7 and 14 reports respectively. The observed duration, based on 18 estimates, is 5.64 ± 2.13 seconds. As path length was 226 km the velocity is 41 km/sec. This indicates a hyperbolic orbit, but due to the large average error in duration, it seems needless to calculate the. Hence the usual parabolic orbit is given. The others were more easily calculated.

Its height is small.

19 Sept, 66

Contact with the SPADATS revealed that there was a decay at 0030Z
18 Sept.66. The decay was from a US rocket body with a classified
payload. Capt. Kuns does not believe that the meteor sighting and
the sat. decay were one and the same. Capt. Kuns will forward us
the final decay trajectory when he received information.

Contact with Dr. Geddes of the Moonwatch team. He had not received
any information on the meteor as of yet. He will forward any
such information when he receives such.

21 Sept.

Contact was made with Lt. Needom, SPADATS concerning Object #
2L23. This object apparently decayed at 06442 18 Sept. 66.
Estimated decay location is 63N 11W.

Evaluation of 17 September 66 UFO Sighting

TESTS:

1. There is insufficient information pertaining to the radar sighting to allow a detailed evaluation. However, in view of the fact the time of this sighting (which appears to be an approximation) is given as 0100Z, and the large meteor sighting in the Michigan area (seen in a number of northeastern states) occurred at 000954, a logical assumption can be made that the two occurrences are one and the same.

2. Many articles have been written confirming the fact that missiles, meteors, etc., frequently leave an ionized path or wake which, as a very large radar area, and hence would provide a sizeable radar return. This ionized cloud may have been the target(s) which were seen to rise from 75000 to 85000 ft. on the height finder.
