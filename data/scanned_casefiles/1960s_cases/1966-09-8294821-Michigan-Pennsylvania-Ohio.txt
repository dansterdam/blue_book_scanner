TO: TDSER
1. The information (which appears to be an approximation) is given in CDC 0099, which appears to be an approach to a radar sighting in the Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio area during the time of this sighting. No supplemental radar information is available. It is deemed that the two occurrences are one and the same.
2. Many articles have been written confirming the fact that military pilots and planes now provide a precise radar return. This ionized cloud may have been an elusive track, (perhaps an anomalous propagation) and may have given an approximate target return according to the report.

THE GREAT FIREBALL of 1966 SEPTEMBER 17 A.M.S.R.C. 2591

On this date a remarkable fireball or bolide appeared at about 7:35 p.m. E.S.T. It was observed from as far west as Michigan and as far east as Pennsylvania. The fireball was exceptionally bright and impressive. It traversed the sky from west to east, and exploded while still high in the atmosphere. It gave off sparks and debris as it moved along its trajectory. The explosion was observed by hundreds of people from there the body was below the horizon. Its brilliancy was excessively great and it appeared to be falling to earth at a steep angle.

According to the information gathered, the fireball was observed from the states of Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, as well as from many parts of Ontario, Canada. Numerous reports were received from police, firemen, astronomers, naturalists, and other institutions, as well as from many private individuals. All who saw it were impressed with its brilliance, and some described it as brighter than the sun.

Many diagrams were made, showing the path and course of the fireball. However, when the azimuth lines were plotted on the usual regional charts for triangulation studies, they did not intersect at a common point. This would indicate that the data received was not entirely consistent, and that there were some variations in the reported observations.

Calculations were made from the data received, but because the various measurements were not complete, a fully satisfactory determination of the orbit and trajectory could not be obtained. It is estimated that the diameter of the fireball was approximately 6-8 feet, and that its height at the time of the explosion was about 30 miles. The duration of the fireball, from first appearance to final explosion, was from 15 to 20 seconds. The complete reports were serious. Had all the plotted paths been correct, even approximately, it would have been possible to determine the orbit and trajectory with a fair degree of accuracy. With the data available, however, it was not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions regarding the azimuth, elevations, and attitudes. Eventually the most probable sub-beginning point and sub-end point were fixed. The duration, direction, and other details were a series of reasonably close estimates, but not fully established facts.

The fireball was very brilliant. The mean of a numerical estimate is L = 6 x 10^6, another said 5 x 10^6, and still another gave 3 x 10^6 candle-power. Several observers mentioned that the fireball was brighter than the full moon. The color was described as bluish-white. The explosion was heard by 23. The duration given is very variable, the longest being 20 to 30 minutes, and the shortest from 15 to 20 seconds. The apparent size, as seen, ranged from that of a grapefruit to that of a basketball. The explosion was accompanied by a smoky or dusty trail, which at times appeared to be greenish. As said, this latter was so intense as to be seen superimposed on the daylight sky. It is a pity that more complete and consistent observations were not obtained.

Calculations indicate that the fireball travelled at a velocity of 33 km/sec, or 20.5 mi/sec. The entry angle was 22 degrees, and the length of the visible path was 423 km, or 263 mi. The height at the beginning was 141 + 27 km, and height at the end of the visible path was 27 km. The total kinetic energy released was approximately 1.5 x 10^14 ergs.

The fireball was very brilliant. The mean of a numerical estimate is L = 4.4 x 10^6 candle-power.

The time and location of the fireball are given as 1966 Sept. 17 7:35 p.m. E.S.T. The azimuth and elevation at the start point were approximately 284 degrees W. and 42 degrees N. At the explosion point, the azimuth was 294 degrees W. and the elevation was 26 degrees N.

"Lite Lights Sky
N.Y. to Illinois

Romney Thought 
He Was Attacked

A meteorite lightened skies over much of the eastern part of the nation tonight, and a flaming object described as 'a bright orange-white light' was reported over Shelby county, Ind., Marion, Ind.

The reports came to in-
house switchboards through 
police and fire department
calls from New York to Il-
linois and Michigan.

Michigan Gov. George Rom-
ney, who was flying from
Sault Ste. Marie to Detroit, 
Mich., said the meteorite 
made a 'loud noise' and 'ter-
rifying experience.'

'We thought we were under
attack,' Romney said.

The meteorite was reported
in the northern part of the 
state, and police departments 
in several areas were flooded 
with calls. Fragments of the
burning object were reported 
down in a farm field near the
tiny town of Swanville, Ind.,
where witnesses said it arrived
in a shower of light and was on the ground for several minutes before disappearing.

In Chicago, the chief meteorologist at the U.S. Weather Bureau office said the
light was seen by several persons in his city, but he assured the public there was
not a 'plane crash or any type of calamity.' The light, he said, was a 'natural phenomena' and that portions of the object fell near the Wayne-Oakland farm
near Swanville, A number of farmers in that area reported they saw the object fall.

The local weather bureau said the object was a 'full moon rocket' which had
landed in the area of the Wayne-Oakland farm, but a spokesman said they thought
it was a plane that crashed.

This was one of the biggest and most brilliant meteoric displays seen in this
area in years, meteorologists said.

Meteorite Lights Sky From N.Y. to Illinois
Romney Though He Was Attacked
A meteorite light-ed skies over central part of the nation tonight, a chunk fell off and dropped into a soybean field near Marion, Ind.
The meteorite pummeled roads for hundreds of miles across states from New York to Illinois. There were reports it fell to earth in much country near Remington, Ind.
Michigan City, George Ram-sey... said they had just loaded a plane with passengers for the local USAF airport when the object flashed across the skies. 
"From its bright glow, we were afraid it might be a plane crashing," he said they had to delay the flight until they were sure it was not a crash.

SMITHSONIAN INVESTIGATING
Did Meteorite Fall Here?
BY WALTER RYBECK
WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 - The Daily News Bureau
- For a spectacular fireball identified as an exploding meteorite flashed across the eastern United
States Saturday evening, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Institution meteorologist was trying to unravel the mystery of a specimen that came down in 1932 or 1933.
E. P. Henderson, a research associate in the Smithsonian's division of meteorites, is seeking that the specimen fell on a farm in either Michigan, Pennsylvania or Ohio.
Even 35 years ago, Dayton was a flourishing city, and he had visited several sites of such a fall, Henderson said.
"BY MY QUESTION, the identity of the individual L. P. Kover, who, as a University of Cincinnati student in 1935, sent the item. Do probably reported the specimen to the Smithsonian," Henderson went on.

Extracted text from the document:

"Estimated size: 43' 13" W, 6' - 44' 40" N at 43 ± .51 km
Trajectory: 265°
Uncorrected azimuth: 265° - 285°
Parabolic orbit: s - 0.317', s = 174.4', e = 5 .200 + .9 - 0.73 A.U.
A search in the Astronomical Numerical Data Service gives several fireball events on the date and similar radiants. These are:
No. 349 1909 Sept. 14
No. 3016 1901 Sept. 14
No. 3039 1909 Sept. 20
No. 3240 1914 Sept. 5
No. 5378 1914 Sept. 8
When we remember that probably a hundred or more fireballs are reported each year, one wonders whose radiants lie near the celestial equator and were it not for this concentrated effort on a few dates, how many more fireballs would have remained unknown. The Observatory at Detroit, Mich., will publish a paper on this fireball based upon very extensive data from previous observations.

A.M.S. No. 2302
This brilliant fireball appeared about 5.34 p.m. E.S.T. It seems to have been observed over portions of Michigan, Ontario, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
It is believed that the sub-point point is quite accurate, the main body being seen over Erie, Pennsylvania. From the elements derived from this data and as figured by F.L. Whipple of the Harvard College Observatory, the velocity was quite low, about 8 km per second, and the height at beginning and end were 61 and 19 km respectively. The reports from airline pilots fortunately were from widely scattered points, and this gave a good basis for triangulation, giving its height, path and other elements with reasonable accuracy. This was a moderately large fireball, probably between that of Moon and Venus in brightness. Do large fireballs have a tendency to break up into smaller fragments, while small ones remain as single units? This fireball seems to have maintained its integrity over a wide range in the calculated heights of beginning and end points. Resulting estimates of the length of path were 59 km, and the average error in duration, it seems needless to calculate this. Since the usual procedure in such cases is to derive the velocity and height and then calculate the mass, size, etc., we might question the advisability of this and wonder if the converse would not be better, i.e., to try to determine the size and then see what the velocity, height, etc. would be. In any case, it is small."

TDESER/V. D. Bryant/m3b/rolo/6 Oct 66
Evaluation of 17 September 66 UFO Sighting

1. There is insufficient information pertaining to the detailed evaluation to be made. However, in view of the fact that the time of this sighting (which appears to be an air investigation) is given as 0300, a logical assumption can be made that this UFO occurrence was non-visual.

2. Many articles have been written concerning the fact that sightings, recurring with frequency, have no consistent pattern or value which has a very large radar scope size, and hence would require a special radar which may, or may not, be available. This is inferred from the information furnished that "the light was seen at 35000 ft. on the height finder."
