REPORT FORM FOR UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS

Information marked * is vital

• Place of observation: [Blacked out] Mass.

• Date: June 14, 1966 • Time: 9:30 P.M.
(Give time Standard and whether a.m.or p.m.)

• Accuracy of time given above:
(e.g. say "exact", or "+1 minute", or "±5 minutes", etc.)
No accuracy at all in my worst excitement held but check but
9:30 time I was with my wife 10 to 10:15 PM ETS

Direction in which object was first seen:
(To N, or SE, or NNW, etc.)
South-Southwest slightly

Direction in which object was last seen: west

• Length of time object was seen: no more than half minute

• Apparent direction in which object travelled: south to west
(N-S, SE-NW, W-E, etc.)

Did it change direction? no - rise to my view from tree tops at the
back of my garden, and rise in sky to west

General impression of speed: very fast and blurry

Size and shape (if any): sphere - very large in
(if just like a star, say "star-like") relative to other planet and seemed - fairly close, bright

Brightness and color: extremely bright and orange in color

- page 3 -

Here is the text from the document:

Any marked variation in brightness: No

Did it explode, disintegrate, or suddenly vanish? No

* Any tail or trail: No

Did any sound accompany the object? I was on a Screened Porch and heard no sound

If sound followed later, give time interval:

Was it examined with binoculars or telescopes or photographed? No

Any other remarks: This object was in the half-way distance York of a beam which was not like an air beacon. It was from NNE of Nobscut but might have been Lincoln. The beam was shorter in length then an air beacon. I should say it covered the path, being never too high while visible, to me, badly winded but I mean the beam itself as being a path of light.

Name: [redacted]
Phone No: [redacted]
Address: Concord, Mass
Date: [redacted]

Not a satellite.
Possibly a balloon.

AG.
