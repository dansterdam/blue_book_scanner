one

9. COURSE
South

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Object was steadily moving from the North to the South observed by WX observer through theodolite while taking observation on WX balloon. Object starlike in appearance except for movement. Observed for 1-2 min and could have been observed longer except for tracking observations.

11. COMMENTS
Echo was over Reno at 0355AM, however it's motion was to the NE. ECHO was over Salt Lake City at 0355AM moving NE. Elko is midway between these locations. If reported direction was in error the object was probably ECHO. Also there is the possibility that this was one of the other visible satellites. Sighting characteristic of satellite, if not ECHO then probably 1963 B PETRA.

Statement on celestial movement sighted from this station:

This morning, 20 August 1963, while taking a pilot balloon sounding I observed through the theodolite an object moving from north to south. Except for its steady movement it could not be distinguished from one of the brighter stars.

I stopped movement of the theodolite twice to be sure of no illusion from this source.

The object was in sight from one to two minutes, although it could have been followed for a much longer time but for the balloon tracking.

The time was between 0L03 and 0L06 PST; elevation angle 27 to 36 degrees, azimuth 233 to 238, from Elko airport.
