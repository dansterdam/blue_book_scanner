PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP
30 OCT 72     30/0107Z

2. LOCATION
Garwood, New Jersey

3. SOURCE
Civilian

10. CONCLUSION
Possible: AIRCRAFT

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
3

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted 3 objects that had a bright green and red glow. The objects were "flattened out hamburger shaped," traveling at speeds near 1000 mph and were 1 to 2 miles high.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
30 seconds

COMMENTS: Two of the witnesses give that time as 9 or 10 minutes rather than 30 seconds. One gives the direction as NW to E. Both witnesses said that there was only one object and one said "I think it was an aircraft." Although there are numerous conflicting points, since one witness feels that it was an aircraft it seems that it may have been one.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground Visual

7. COURSE
NNW - NNE

[ ] Yes
[X] No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
[ ] Yes
