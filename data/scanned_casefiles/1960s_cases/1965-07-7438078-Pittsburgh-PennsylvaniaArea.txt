               received from individuals also News Media concerning observations
               of UFO's. The general description, cigar shaped with red exhaust.
               The Western Bureau, AFIN, Pittsburgh, Observer, and WDTL Planetarium
               were contacted. The Observatory and Planetarium concluded that
               the objects sighted were meteor showers. News Media published same.
               As of this date, the News Media has given no publicity to UFO's.

25 Jul 65    Several reports received from residents of the Pittsburgh area.

               directions.

               sighted 2130 - 2200 hours. Sphere rotated back and forth, stopped,
               then rotated and disappeared over the horizon, no claims, no haze.
               Also reports of cigar shaped objects, same type reported 22 Jul 65.

1 Aug 65     Several reports received. Silver sphere object sighted. One report
               stated silver shaped saucer, small oval windows seen 1630 hours.
               Further questioning revealed report unreliable.

               individual saw nothing.

4 Aug 65     Report received of red haze in the sky 2110 hours, object sighted

               fast rate of speed, made a whistling sound, came down low and
               flew over residence. Also another report of flying saucer type
               object moving at a fast rate of speed. Further investigation
               revealed report unreliable.

SUMMARY: The inspecting officer has observed nothing to date. All reports
are checked and most reports to our knowledge are unreliable and possible hoaxes.
Publicity recently given UFO's we feel has stimulated telephone reports and
because of the number of reports, forms have been reproduced for collecting
information. In addition, which is checked further by the Information Officer at a
later date. No releases by this organization concerning UFO's have been made
to the news media. SAFOI has been contacted and the current report on Project
Blue Book has been reviewed. Number of observers reporting UFO's are kept on file.
The FAA, Weather Bureau, other military installations in the area, Allegheny Observatory, Buhl Planetarium have been
