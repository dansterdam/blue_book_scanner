10. CONCLUSION
Possible (HOT AIR BALLOON)
The police dept at Cincinnati reported that they had received 20 reports of unusual sightings on 1 Jan 68 from 920 to 930 PM. The description is similar to those of segment bag hot air balloons.

11. SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted two red lights in the Eastern sky. The objects changed position relative to each other. After watching for approx 15 minutes the lower light became dimmer and dimmed and disappeared. The total time to disappear was about 15 sec. About 1 minute later the upper light disappeared the same way.

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Cincinnati, Ohio, which occurred on 1 January 1968, at approximately 9:20 to 9:30 pm, EST.

2. The observer sighted two bright red lights at an angle of 15 degrees elevation, directly east. One remained fixed while the other moved from a position directly below to a position directly horizontal with respect to the first, and then back below the first. The movement was very slow. The lower one disappeared at 9:23 pm and the fixed object disappeared at 9:30 pm. The objects would start to get dimmer and then disappeared about fifteen seconds later. It was also stated that the color was not constant in intensity throughout the sighting, but seemed to flash and flicker.

3. Did you receive any reports of unusual objects for this date? We would appreciate your comments as to a possible cause for this sighting.

4. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.

The two objects were bright red and appeared about as bright as the brightest stars. Although viewed through 7X35 binoculars no edges or other details could be observed. They blinked almost off at about 1 second intervals, but were not synchronized. My original impression was that they were a radio tower with red lights, but, of course, I know there were more at that direction.

GARNET BAG HOT AIR BALLOONS

Hot Air Balloons made out of garnet bags usually appear as a red, orange, yellow or white light in the sky and may remain aloft as long as 10 to 15 minutes. If they are fairly close, they may appear as two objects, one on top of the other. The bottom object is the heat source and is quite bright and the upper dull glowing object is the garnet bag.

Usually the heat source is on a balsa wood platform. When the object is aloft it may move in an erratic manner or a straight trajectory, depend-ing on the wind. The balloon also flashes and flickers as the wind blows the candles. When the candle burn down the platform may catch fire and sometimes causes sparks and pieces of burning debris to fall; however, they usually burn out before they hit the earth. Shortly after the sparks stop falling the object disappears.

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
As I was driving home and passed the turn toward my subdivision
I glanced out my window and noticed these two bright red
lights. I had never noticed anything like them, so I rushed
home and observed from my yard.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
When they again reached the final position noted in 2) on
page 4, the lower one (12) began getting dimmer and
dimmer until it disappeared. The time they took to disappear
was about 15 seconds (even through binoculars). About
a minute later #1 disappeared the same way.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
[YES] NO. IF "YES", DESCRIBE:

During sighting, my neighbor, Mrs. [REDACTED] called the local police to ask if they knew what they were. The police replied that they didn't know, but they were checking.

The following morning, Jan. 2, 1968, a small item about the sighting appeared in the Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper.

I watched the newspaper (Cincinnati Post & Times Star) for three weeks and when no explanation was given, I decided to file a report. The night of the sighting I wrote down all the information I could think of.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

While driving home on the evening of Jan. 1, 1968, I noticed two bright red lights to my left (East). The whole family was with me at the time. About 3-5 minutes later I had arrived home, I went to the side of my home and saw the lights were still there.

I hurried inside, grabbed my 7X35 binoculars and went to my back yard which faces east. My yard is on a slight hill and I have a good view-to the horizon. My wife phoned both next door neighbors. We all watched as the lower of the two very slowly changed positions. I observed my watch to note the time. Watching through binoculars did not yield any additional information. After watching for 10 minutes (by watch) we observed the lower one disappear. A minute later the other disappeared. The total time required to disappear was estimated at about 15 seconds. The objects blinked off very brightly at about 4 second intervals. We compared these brightness to that of the brightest stars. The temperature was noted to be +9°F with no moon and no wind. There were no clouds and no sound was heard. After the sighting I wrote down all the facts in case a report was to be filed.

Dear Major Quintinilla:

After searching the local newspaper for three weeks and reflecting upon the situation, I feel it is my duty to report a UFO sighting. I jotted the facts down at the end of the sighting and I'll note them in item form.

DATE: Monday, January 1, 1968
TIME: 9:20 to 9:30 EST (noted by wristwatch)
PLACE: My yard, 1148B Narrowsburg Dr., Cincinnati, Ohio
WEATHER: +9° F; Clear, bright, cloudless, starry night.
No moonlight.

UFO: Two bright red lights, as bright as the brightest star; angle of 15° with respect to the horizon; directly East.

MOVEMENT: One remained fixed while the other moved from a position directly below the first to a position directly horizontal with respect to the first and then back to below the first.

Movement was very slow. The lower one disappeared at 9:29 p.m.; the fixed one disappeared at 9:30 p.m. Disappearance was by getting dimmer until gone, as if movement was directly away from me. They seemed to disappear in about 15 seconds total.

VIEWED: Continuously; Brightness not constant, but seemed to get dimmer about every 4 seconds. No sound; viewed through binoculars and no other features seen.

WITNESSES: Mrs. [redacted] (wife); Mr. & Mrs. [redacted] (neighbors); and [redacted]
