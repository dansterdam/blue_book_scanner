The text of the document is as follows:

Major R. P. Casalaspro
Commander
277th Selective Service Squadron
Selfridge Air Force Base, D. C.

Dear Major Casalaspro:

If you think it appropriate I wonder if you would be kind enough to forward the attached report of a "flying saucer" to the Air Force office which is concerned with such phenomena.

Mr.        who submits this report, is a 63 3 clerk employed at this Headquarters for the past two years. He is honorably discharged from the Army after more than three years service in World War II. He is 52 years of age.

Mr.        is generally regarded at this Headquarters as a completely honest and reliable person. For this reason we consider it advisable to bring his report available to the Air Force.

This office as well as Mr.        would be most interested in knowing whether it develops that there is some explanation for the phenomenon.

Sincerely yours,

FOR THE STATE DIRECTOR

F. B. WOODWORTH

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically a letter dated August 27, 1964 from Maston M. Jacks of the United States Air Force to an unnamed recipient. The letter discusses a response to a previous letter dated July 22, 1964, which appears to have reported an unusual object observed in the Littleston, Illinois area. The letter indicates that the original report did not contain sufficient information to allow for a proper evaluation, and requests additional information for a supplementary investigation.

Text output:

August 27, 1964

Dear Mr. __________,

This is in response to your letter of July 22, 1964, in which you reported observing an unusual object in the Littleston, Illinois area.

Since your report did not contain sufficient information to allow our investigators to make an evaluation, we are unable to provide a definitive statement concerning the sighting.

We would appreciate receiving any additional details you can supply, such as the exact time, duration, direction of movement, color, size, shape, and altitude of the object. This information would be most helpful in our efforts to determine the nature of the sighting.

If you are able to furnish further data, please forward it to this office for a supplementary investigation.

Sincerely,

The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with handwritten annotations.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"I'm writing this just as those described in his letter, and the said sighted it, which I am inclined to agree with their conclusions - around 9:30 pm on that date. I have known these witnesses for some time, and I have no reason to doubt their statements.

As I seem to be the only one in the original number, if would have passed it on to the UFO squad. It would have seemed the proper thing to do.

The size of the object or detail and was very careful. In dimension it seemed to be much larger than those seen before. Apparently he was not afraid but more curious to find out what it really was.

There was a trace of ground fog, about as high as a car.

Although the citizens, town sighting seems at first without some hestancy (sic) the said did confirm that they had noticed that earlier. Liberties, they also seemed to be rather sure, you will notice they even seem to be more certain than the original observers of the situation.

So much for that case, to be have an official report on the memo case of April 11, 1964. This was the very strange smoke trail seen. On the ground, found no trace of landing. They have been gone back and examined thoroughly. No evidence for any landing.

Cordially,"
