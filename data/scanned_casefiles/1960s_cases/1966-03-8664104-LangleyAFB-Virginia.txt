h. Astronomical Conditions: Captain D. J. Morris, USAF, Chief of Navigator Training, 4500 Air Base Wing Instrument School, provided the following information:

(1) The Planet Venus could be seen on a true bearing of 115 to 125 degrees from the Langley AFB area. Also, Venus would be visible from 10 to 20 degrees above the horizon. Venus would have been the only planet or star visible at the time of the sighting, and would have appeared as a bright continuous glowing light.

i. Interception Action: None.

j. This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Lockum, USAF, 4500 Air Base Wing Operations Division, Langley AFB, Virginia, the description of the object was given by B-5 Shue and B-5 Stompmaker to B-3 Comm, USCC, who was on duty at the 5th U. S. Coast Guard District, and passed the information to Captain Cauley. Captain Cauley, Duty Officer, 4500 Air Base Wing Command Post, went to the Langley AFB Control Tower to view the object with binoculars. Captain Cauley stated that the object looked like the "morning star," and was certainly an astronomical body. The investigating officer, for this report, believes the object was the Planet Venus. The large error in the reported height above the horizon was probably because no measuring instruments were used.
