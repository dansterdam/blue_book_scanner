This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the image describes the observation of a celestial body, likely Venus, from the Langley AFB area. It provides details about the altitude, wind, and temperature conditions, as well as the actions taken by the observers. The text also mentions that the report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert K. Lang of the USAF's 4500th Air Base Wing Operations Division at Langley AFB.

Astronomical Conditions: Captain D. J. Morris, USAF, of the Navigator Training School, the following information: 

(1) The planet Venus could be seen on a true bearing 115 to 125 degrees from the Langley AFB area. Also, Venus would be visible from 10 to 20 degrees above the horizon. Venus would have been the only planet or star visible at the time of the sighting and would have appeared as a bright continuous glowing light.

i. Interception Action Taken: None.

This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert K. Lang, USAF, 4500th Air Base Wing Operations Division, Langley AFB, Virginia. The report was made by Captain Cailley, U.S. Coast Guard, who was on duty at the 5th U.S. Coast Guard District Operations to Captain Cailley. Captain Cailley stated the object looked like the "morning star," and was certainly an astronomical body. The object's brightness and size prevented definitive identification.
