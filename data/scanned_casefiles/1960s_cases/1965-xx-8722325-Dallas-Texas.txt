Dear Allen:

I had a long chat with [redacted] North Texas University students, about his U.F.O. sighting. It all appears quite vague since he doesn't even recall the exact date of the sighting. He said he was actually looking at a U.P.O. when a student told him. It was during the time last summer when there were so many reports.

He reported the following:

size - small - couldn't tell the angular diameter - approximately the size of match head at arm's length.
shape - round
speed - 1309 of sky in 15 seconds. ?
distance - no way of knowing.
time of sighting - 9:30 P.M.
direction of movement - from north-northeast to southwest. (First seen 45Â° high).

color - white
twinkle - no
weather conditions - very clear and no moon.
magnitude - -1.0 (he does understand the Stellar magnitude scale).

He said it appeared to move faster than an airplane and an artificial satellite and did not deviate from a straight course. He also added that no one else had seen the object - he was alone at his home at the time?

I'll send you a letter regarding the telescope material in the next few days.

Best regards,
William A. Dexter
Planetarium Director
