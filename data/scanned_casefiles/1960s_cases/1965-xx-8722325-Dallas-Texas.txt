The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter on the letterhead of "ST. MARK'S SCHOOL OF TEXAS, DALLAS, TEXAS 75206", dated November 30, 1965, addressed to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the Dearborn Observatory, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois.

The text of the letter is as follows:

"Dear Dr. Hynek,

I had a sighting that with North Texas University students. For about 6 minutes they observed quite a large object moving in various directions. It appears quite close since the apparent size was larger than a full moon. The object had only navigation lights - no other lights were seen. So many reports have been made since last spring that it seems something should be looked into.

Size - small - couldn't tell the angular diameter - probably the size of moon's image.
Color - round.
Time - 1 to 1 1/2 minutes (on and off).
Speed - very slow - may be hovering.
Direction - straight north-northeast to southwest.
Course - change - first straight, then to the right, then straight.
Atmosphere - very clear and no moon.
Magnitude - about 4.0 (as I understand the stellar magnitude scale).

He said it appeared to move faster than an airplane and did not deviate from a straight course. He also added that no one 'star' had been reported in that area before. The laws of physics would seem to deny the object were a star or airplane. An artificial satellite would not act that way.

I'll send you a letter regarding the telescope material in the next few days.

Best regards,

William A. Hester
Planetarium Director"
