Dear Colonel Manatt:

After a thorough check of the records we have available
for September 24, 1966, we can find no reference to an
unidentified flying object in this area. Since we only
keep our daily records and tapes for a period of 15 days,
it is impossible to check on individual airplanes in the
area at that time.

We are forwarding a copy of your letter to Mr. L. Probst,
Chief, General Aviation District Office, North Philadelphia
Airport, who may be able to furnish you a list of persons
issued banner towing authorizations.

Sincerely,
Leo G. Marshall
Chief Controller
