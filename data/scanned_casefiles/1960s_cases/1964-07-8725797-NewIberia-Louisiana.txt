Dear Sirs,

I am writing this letter to report an observation of an unidentified flying object that I observed on the night of July 8, 1964 at approximately 10:00 p.m. Central Standard Time in the vicinity of New Iberia, Louisiana.

The object was sighted by myself and a boy companion who was visiting me at the time. We were standing outside my home at the time and looking up at the stars when the object came into view. It appeared to be traveling in a southwesterly direction at a high rate of speed and was emitting a bright reddish-orange glow. The object made no sound and appeared to be oval or elliptical in shape. It seemed to change direction slightly as it passed overhead and then disappeared from sight. The total observation time was approximately 30-45 seconds.

This is the first and only time I have ever observed an object of this nature and I can assure you that I am not the type of person to imagine or fabricate such an incident. I am a mature, responsible adult and can clearly distinguish between hallucinations, natural occurrences, and something clearly out of the ordinary. I feel the details I have provided are accurate and I would be willing to cooperate further should you desire additional information.

Please let me know if you require any clarification or have additional questions regarding this incident. I await your reply.

Sincerely,

Report No. 148
Washington 25, D.C.
Dear Sirs,

On the evening of 28 June 1964 at approximately 8:40 p.m. CST, I was standing in my backyard observing the night sky when I saw a disc-shaped object hovering above the treeline approximately 500 yards away. The object was silvery-white in color and was approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. It appeared to be rotating slowly and was making a faint humming sound.

The object remained stationary for approximately 2-3 minutes, after which it suddenly accelerated upward at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view in a matter of seconds. I observed no exhaust or trail of any kind as the object ascended. 

After the object disappeared, I immediately called the local police department to report the sighting. I was subsequently interviewed by an officer from the Air Force's Project Blue Book, but no further action was taken.

I am a 42-year-old male with no history of mental illness or drug/alcohol abuse. I have 20/20 vision and was sober at the time of the incident. I have never had a similar experience before and have no reason to fabricate this report.

I hope this information is of use to your investigation. Please let me know if you require any additional details.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s.

The text in the document is as follows:

August 13, 1964

Dear [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of July 31, 1964, in which you reported an unidentified flying object observed in New Iberia, Louisiana, on July 31, 1964.

The UFO you observed may possibly have been a star, planet, or some other natural phenomena. However, based upon the information provided in your letter, there is not enough data for us to make a conclusive identification.

Please note that Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's program for investigating UFO reports, was closed on December 17, 1969. We are no longer actively investigating UFO reports, but we do maintain a file on your case.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. (redacted),

The Air Force answered into a problem land level on 23 July 1964, a possible military investigation of the UFO observation. The information indicates that the sighting was not considered hostile by the unidentified flying object. The observation lasted nearly one minute, during which time the object is said to have been at a dangerously low level. The vehicle was dangerously underestimated in the skies to the ground.

Special on unidentified aerial phenomena is important in your information.

Sincerely,
MAJOR M. J. JAKES

Thank you for your time and trouble.
