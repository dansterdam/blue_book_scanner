Chief of Information
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.
REFERENCE: DOD Release No. 179-62, February 6, 1962
Air Force UFO Report

Gentlemen:
This letter is in reply to the above mentioned news release issued by the Department of Defense on February 6, 1962, regarding Air Force Unidentified Flying Object Report No. 179-62.

I appreciate your reply but cannot agree with you. News releases will not convince the public that flying saucers do not exist.

Since you think flying saucers are so unimportant, why do you bother issuing a press release on the subject? Obviously, it shouldn't be worth the paper or time. Since you did bother with a five-page release, apparently there is more to the subject than you admit. Your conclusions regarding sightings, reflections, lights, balloons, etc. and then you state that all UFOs "could be natural phenomena." Why should we believe you? The Defense of the United States is always the excuse.

Why continue people "you can't give your case the Office of Aerial Phenomena." This way, people get confused with the "National Investigating Committee on Aerial Phenomena." We are not going to be even more confused.

On page 2 you give a UFO Report Evaluation by Category and Percentage Breakdown. I notice that 175 of the sightings were considered "astronomical." Of course, since you call most UFOs astronomical, this is understandable. Why don't you admit the obvious - that a certain percentage cannot be explained away so easily? Doesn't it?

Since these so-called objects do not give any indication of threat to the national security (your statement), why is the Department of Defense issuing news releases on the subject? Why are photographs and other data confiscated from people who have evidence of flying saucers? Something is not quite right here.

The image does not contain any photographs. It is a scanned page from an old document, likely from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a letter or response discussing UFO sightings and related topics.

Why insult expert civilian pilots, radar operators, and corroborating expert witnesses. Why continue they are "deluded" by the experience of instrument flight, and of the physico-psychological effects of "staring at fixed lights in the sky"? Let's assume the passengers have seen "round metallic objects with lights" circling the plane. Performing stunts! I suppose they are too illusional and passengers "see" exactly the same hallucination.

Myself have noted many times heavy jet fighters circling at high altitudes, and they look round just like UFOs. They may well look round as matter flow! 

Paragraph 2 on Page 2 gives "firework displays and flares" also as being called UFOs which needs no comment!

On September 11, 1961, at 9:00 p.m. a large UFO passed over San Diego. I saw it! It was not a disc. Insignificant, dull, nondescript, elongated, more moon does? & like a blimp, a cloud, searchlight, bird, reflection, spurious radar indication, hook navigation drifting instruments, or blinking star? What other explanation do you have!!! It was larger than six standard bomber stars. What kind of an idiot you are that you won't take it as a form of a flying craft, some sort of object, and other corroborating data.  So does HICAP give any corroborating data?

Another curious SIGHTING on March 19, 1958: Why do you start with that date? Wasn't that when Mantell saw the UFO? Why didn't you point that two dates coincide!

You can't keep this up too much longer.  It for one will help to spread the word. And many others are helping, as this apparent fabrications. Will you forever assume that all the public are idiotic children? Remember Lincoln's words: You would have been better off with no nerve releases at all.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
