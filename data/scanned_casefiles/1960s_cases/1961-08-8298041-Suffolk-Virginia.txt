SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

ORIGINATING AGENCY 4505 Air Refueling Wing
Langley AFB, Va.

REPORT NO. ARMON 61-00001    PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

III. SUMMARY:

1. On 12 August 1961 the preparing officer visited the residence of [redacted] in Suffolk, Va. to further investigate the alleged sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects. It was stated that the objects appeared to be like two bladed propellor (See Incl 1), however the ends seemed to move up and down like wings of a bird. [redacted] was stated that she could not see any body. However, it was said that the body and wings were visible to him (See Incl 2). Both agreed that the size approximated that of a small watermelon, about a foot across when held at arms length, only flat. Both agreed that the color was similar to that of a fire-fly or like the moon when it first rises. [redacted] said that he counted five objects and was positive that there were two and possibly more. There were no exhausts, sound or trails, however the wings appeared to be wavering some.

[Rest of paragraph redacted]

Other witnesses included an eight year old girl and her mother, [redacted] in Suffolk, Va. [redacted] stated her daughter came in the house and told her about the objects, however, she was only able to observe the objects as they were disappearing.

[Rest of document contains some redacted sections]

IV. PREPARING OFFICERS COMMENTS: (See Incl 3)

The [redacted] home is situated about a half a block from a four lane highway which would normally be brightly lighted. On the right hand side of this highway, about half way up the block to the north is a large Oldsmobile dealers building and car lot. Further up the street on the left hand side is a fruit market which stays open 24 hours a day. According to [redacted], both places are brightly lighted with neon lights all night. It is possible that the lights from the highway, the fruit market and the car dealers lot, reflected upon some low flying birds.
