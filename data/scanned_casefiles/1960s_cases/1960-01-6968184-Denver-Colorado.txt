U.F.O. ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Denver, Colo.
Date: 19 January 1960  Hour: 0105
Weather Conditions: WX scattered clouds - visibility 15 plus miles
Description: Elongated - size of ice or slightly larger - blinking one - tail same size as object (Something falling in flames) - slight 1 second.
Direction of Motion: SW
Satellite: (AFCIN-4E3, Phone 69219) No known satellites near at this time - direction wrong. 
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Too fast for possibly meteor.
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E3): N/A
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): Speed too great
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Speed too great
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Unknown
Analysis and Conclusions: The description of this item is characteristic of a bright meteor. The sightings were undoubtedly of a meteor, and this conclusion is further substantiated by the negative radar analysis and the fact that it was too fast for an astronomical object.
