10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION (Possible Aircraft though)
FTD Form 164 sent to witness, not returned after 30 days.
Will re-evaluate if further info is received.

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
5 mins

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Obj was round, approx size of a baseball, and orange in color.
There was a hazy film trailing the obj. A sound was heard but
observer couldn't describe it. At first the obj seemed to be
hovering about ½ mile in the air. Observer stopped car and got
out to watch it. Went back into car when obj started to move,
and flew above the car. Tried to start the car but it wouldn't
start. Car started after obj had disappeared overhead. Duration and flight path is consistent with a/c sighting. Apparent hovering could be due to motion of car or the a/c moving
directly towards the observer. There is no indication that the
object had anything whatsoever to do with the car not starting.
(JAB says more tech data needed), therefore, 164 was sent.
However, it was a possible aircraft sighting.
