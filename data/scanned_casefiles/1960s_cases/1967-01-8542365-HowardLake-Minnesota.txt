SUBJECT: REPORT OF UFO                                                   25 January 1967

A M[redacted], Howard Lake, Minnesota, age 32 years, called to
report the following incident: [phone number redacted]

He was on his way to work this morning (works for the Gleason Construction Company) and between 4:10 and 5:00 AM, south of Howard Lake near highways 101, 5 and 212, his pickup truck quit. He drives a 1964 Chevrolet pickup. He went out and looked under the hood and he noticed a very bright light to his right "like a light from a welder's torch". It came closer and landed on the highway. He became frightened and ran into the car and locked the doors. This light was approximately 75 feet long and 30 feet wide. While he was watching it three legs came out of the bottom like they were on springs.

It made a loud whirling noise and he could hear it through the windows of the car.

Then an elevator like object came out of the bottom and a man walked out. He was dressed in a silver blue tight fitting suit with a "fish bowl" on his head. He was of average height and build. He walked over to the side of the "thing" to check on something then walked back in. It then took off. It all took about three or four minutes.

Mr. [redacted] sounded quite upset. He asked what he should do. I asked if he had called the newspaper. He said no, and wondered if I had had any other calls reporting this incident. I said no. He said he was going to call his wife and then decide further what should be done. I told him I would contact him if we heard further concerning this UFO. He said he wasn't drunk and doesn't read material and is of sound health. He does wear glasses but his eyes
