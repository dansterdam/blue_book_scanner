CONCLUSIONS

The points B and C on the map are located at the bottom of a gently v-shaped cut which runs east and west. On either side the ground slopes upward at about 30 degrees at most to the level on which the points A and F are located. The trees at point B are about 10 feet beyond the edge of the street and about 30 feet from a car at C. The trees were from 15 to 25 feet in height. The athletic field was about 100 yards in width (east to west). There were also some bare trees in the position (indicated by the cross-hatching) across the street from F.

I could find no lights in the area to which the phenomenon could be easily attributed.

I checked Mrs. [redacted] car to see if the tail lights of a car going in the opposite direction would be reflected in the windshield. They would not; the windshield is set at a 45 degree angle.

The car is not completely soundproof. An airplane motor could definitely be heard.

Two other facts may have some bearing on the incident:

1) Some mail in the Naperville area is delivered by helicopter.
2) Mrs. [redacted] had the impression after she turned the corner at C and proceeded toward F that a car at point X started moving down the hill and turned the corner at C, heading east. Mrs. [redacted] had no recollection of this.

There was a report of a similar object seen by a couple in Lisle, Ill., on the same night. This incident was reported in the Naperville Clarion on the first Thursday in April, one week after the item on the [redacted] sighting.

Mrs. [redacted] had a letter addressed to the editor of the Naperville Sun from [redacted] of Clayton, Georgia, who was apparently an acquaintance.


- page 2 -

of the editor. She wrote that she would be happy to supply addresses to which

Mrs. [REDACTED] and Mrs. [REDACTED] could report their sightings. The latter

went on to say that many people have seen such objects, but are afraid to

report them. The letter also suggested that the Sun start a column on

the subject of UFO's.

The group from Wheaton consisted of two high school boys and one of their

teachers (male) according to Mrs. [REDACTED]. One of the boys claimed to have seen

the object earlier (about 9:40) in Wheaton on the same evening as the

[REDACTED] sighting. According to Mrs. [REDACTED], the boy from Wheaton, Illinois) claims to have seen some 23 UFO's over a

period of time (though never this low) and to be able to tell when they are

in the vicinity by extrasensory perception.

The Wheaton group apparently took a large number of measurements and

expressed typical hostility toward the Air Force.

Note: According to [REDACTED], neither she nor Mrs. [REDACTED] drinks.

The diagrams in all cases are tracings of the diagrams drawn by the two

women.

Naperville, IL, 26 Mar 62
case includes 18 ADIABATIC CHARTS


- page 17 -

The image appears to be a grid or graph paper document with very faint markings. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor image quality and high contrast. The only partially readable text I can discern is "-1050-" at the bottom left of the grid, but even this is not completely clear. The document seems to be a technical or scientific chart with a grid layout and some light markings or data points across its surface.


- page 18 -

The image appears to be a complex document with a grid-like structure, primarily consisting of rows and columns of text and numbers. However, much of the text is too small or blurry to be legibly read through OCR. The document seems to be a detailed form or report with multiple sections, but the specific content is not clearly discernible due to the low resolution and faded nature of the scanned document.


- page 19 -

The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with very fine, uniform squares. The grid covers most of the page and is printed in black and white. There are some markings or notations along the left side and right side margins of the grid, but they are too small and blurry to read clearly. The image looks like it could be a data sheet, chart, or technical document with a complex grid layout.


- page 20 -

The image appears to be an Adiabatic Chart with a large grid table on the left side and a detailed chart description on the right side. However, due to the low contrast and image quality, most of the text is illegible. The only clearly readable text is the title "ADIABATIC CHART" on the right side of the document.


- page 21 -

The image appears to be a grid or graph paper document with vertical and horizontal lines. Most of the text is too illegible to read clearly. There are some faint markings and lines drawn across the grid, but the specific details are not discernible due to the low contrast and image quality.


- page 22 -

Mrs. [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted] were interviewed separately concerning their March 1 report of a UFO sighting in Naperville, Illinois. The interviews were conducted by Miss [redacted] and me on the evening of April 19. Both women were taken separately to the area where the reported sighting took place. The accounts coincided in where the sighting took place, the color of the object (or objects), and its general line of motion. But there is wide difference in the two descriptions of size, shape, and specific behavior of the UFO.


- page 23 -

The image appears to be a complex data chart or log, with the title "ADIABATIC CHART" visible in the top right corner. The document consists of multiple columns and rows of numerical data, with a dense grid of numbers and calculations. Much of the text is small and difficult to read clearly due to the image quality. The left side of the document contains a diagonal grid or graph with vertical and horizontal lines, while the right side contains more structured tabular data. The overall document seems to be a technical or scientific record with detailed numerical information.


- page 24 -

The image appears to be a graph paper or grid sheet with very faint markings. Most of the text is illegible due to the low contrast and image quality. The page has two hole punches on the left side, indicating it is part of a bound document. The grid lines are clearly visible, creating a uniform pattern across the entire page, but no specific text or numerical values can be confidently read.


- page 25 -

ADIABATIC CHART

(The rest of the text is too illegible to confidently transcribe. The image appears to be a complex grid-based chart with numerous small boxes and lines, with "ADIABATIC CHART" clearly visible in the top right section of the document.)


- page 26 -

The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with vertical and horizontal lines forming small squares. The left side of the page has some numbers running vertically from 17 to 15. The image is in black and white and looks like it could be a data recording sheet or chart. Most of the grid appears to be blank or lightly marked. The edges of the page are slightly darkened, suggesting this is a scanned document.


- page 27 -

The image appears to be a complex document with a grid-like structure covering most of the page. The right side of the page contains several sections with text, but much of it is too faint or blurry to read clearly. The only legible text I can confidently make out is "ATLANTIC CITY" at the top right of the document. The rest of the text is largely illegible due to the poor image quality and faded print.


- page 28 -

The image appears to be a graph or chart with a grid pattern. The vertical axis on the left side has some numbers visible, including 50, 52, and 54. The page is a black and white document with a faded, slightly worn appearance typical of older scanned documents. Most of the text and markings on the grid are too illegible to read clearly.


- page 29 -

The only clearly legible text on this page is "ADIABATIC CHART" at the top right of the document. The rest of the document appears to be a complex grid or chart with numerous small, faint text entries that are not clearly readable in this image.


- page 30 -

The image appears to be a graph paper or grid sheet with numerical markings on the left side. The visible numbers on the left margin include:

750
800
850
900
950
1000

The rest of the page is filled with a grid pattern of fine lines creating small squares. The image is in black and white and appears to be a scanned document with some slight discoloration and aging around the edges.


- page 31 -

The image appears to be a complex document with multiple grid-like sections and tables. However, most of the text is too small or blurry to be legibly read in this scan. The only partially readable text I can discern is "QUADRATIC CURVE" on the right side of the document. The rest of the text is illegible due to the low resolution and faded nature of the scanned document.


- page 32 -

I apologize, but I cannot discern any readable text on this page. The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with very faint markings, but the text is too illegible to transcribe. The document looks like a technical or data recording sheet with a grid pattern, but no specific text can be made out clearly.


- page 33 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Trees

Athletic Field

Residential Area

Residential Area

Residential Area

Residential Area

The document appears to be a hand-drawn map or diagram with various labeled areas including "Athletic Field" and multiple "Residential Area" sections. There are also some letters marked (X, E, A, B, etc.) and some directional arrows.


- page 34 -

The image appears to be an Adiabatic Chart with a large grid-like table on the left side and several smaller tables and text sections on the right side. However, due to the low contrast and image quality, most of the text is illegible. The only clearly readable text is the title "ADIABATIC CHART" at the top right of the document.


- page 35 -

I apologize, but the image appears to be a grid or graph paper with very faint lines and markings. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor quality of the scan. The only clear elements are the hole punches on the left side of the document and the grid pattern covering most of the page. No readable text can be extracted from this image.


- page 36 -

The image appears to be an adiabatic chart with numerous grid lines and numerical entries. At the top right of the document, the text "ADIABATIC CHART" is visible. The document is primarily composed of a complex grid system with various numerical and textual annotations, though many of the specific details are difficult to read due to the image quality and density of information.


- page 37 -

The image appears to be a graph or chart with a grid pattern. The text on the left side of the image is mostly illegible due to poor image quality. The grid covers most of the page, with some darker areas on the left margin and around the edges of the document. No clear text can be read from this image.

MRS. [REDACTED] ACCOUNT

We talked to Mrs. [REDACTED] in her home for a few minutes, after which she took us in her car (from which the sighting was made) to the area where the incident occurred. Her account is as follows:

She left a canasta party at the home of a friend to take Mrs. [REDACTED] home. The time was about 10:30 p.m. Upon stopping at intersection A, she saw through the side window of the car a number of lights, red in color, in the direction indicated by the dotted arrow. She called the object to the attention of Mrs. [REDACTED]. Mrs. [REDACTED] reports that it would be difficult to say how many lights there were, but she would guess 6 or 8. They were "quite low" (about 10 to 15 degrees) and similar in color and brightness to the tail lights of a car. Their conformation was as in the diagram below:

[A small diagram of dots is shown]

Pulling away from the intersection, the two women speculated that the object might be an airplane, but that it had an extraordinary number of lights for an airplane. Planes often circle in the Naperville area when O'Hare field is fogbound, but this night was very clear, according to Mrs. [REDACTED]. She thought, but was not sure, that Mrs. [REDACTED] had continued to see the object between houses and trees before the car turned west.

Heading west, Mrs. [REDACTED] said that she could see the object again as the car approached point B. It was about the same altitude as before and about 10 to 15 degrees to the left of their line of travel. It appeared very much as it first did, although it seemed to be around the location D on the other side of the athletic field of the high school.

The two women continued to watch the object as the car approached the stop sign at intersection C. At point C (Mrs. [REDACTED] was uncertain whether it was before or after she stopped) the object appeared to turn slowly.

Here is the text from the document:

"like a bus would turn," and began moving toward them. By the time it reached the point E, the lights were arranged as follows:

[Name redacted] said that the three (or four) lights on either side seemed to be about a foot apart and the distance between the two groups was about 60 degrees of arc, corresponding to a separation of about 40 feet at a distance of 40 feet.

The brightness of the lights again corresponded to that of the tail lights of a car.

There were two trees in the field immediately opposite the car. They are indicated by the cross-hatching. Mrs. [Name redacted] says that she does not remember having seen the trees during the sighting, but that it was very dark and she was concentrating on the lights. Â¶ The moon was quite bright when she took us to the spot; it was about 9 p.m.). The trees were bare and about 18 to 25 feet in height. Mrs. [Name redacted] said that if the object had been an airplane, its landing gear would have been in the tree tops. She described the separation of the lights as corresponding to something "larger than a 100," but she emphasized the fact that there was no motor noise.

When the object reached point E, Mrs. [Name redacted] still thinking it might be a plane, came to the conclusion that it would land about 50 feet behind the car. She immediately turned the corner and proceeded north for one block to the top of the slope and, turning west again, stopped the car at F. She was not sure what the object was doing when she turned the corner and as she drove north, but Mrs. [Name redacted] was watching it.

At the point F Mrs. [Name redacted] stopped the car and opened the door on the driver's side, stepping out with one foot. This was the first time she had seen the object without the car window glass intervening. The object now appeared to be headed in a southeasterly direction (indicated by the broken

Up until this point in the incident Mrs. [redacted] had thought the lights were those of a single object. However, the new formation seemed to indicate to her that there were two objects.

After watching the object for a short time, Mrs. [redacted] got back into the car and drove Mrs. [redacted] home. Returning to the area a few minutes later, she was unable to see any trace of the object. Upon returning home she learned that Mrs. [redacted] had reported the incident to the police.

Mrs. [redacted] was unable to estimate the speed of the object, but said that the whole incident seemed to happen very fast. She claims to be familiar with airplanes since her husband is a student pilot. She hesitates to give the object the name "flying saucer" and still thinks there is some more commonplace explanation.

MRS. [REDACTED] ACCOUNT

Upon returning to [redacted] home we learned that Mrs. [redacted] had called and wanted to know if we wished to interview her also. We drove with [redacted] to Mrs. [redacted] home.

It was already quite late (about 10 p.m.) when we arrived at Mrs. [redacted] home. We had already learned from Mrs. [redacted] that Mrs. [redacted] had been contacted by a Wheaton High School group which was interested in flying saucers. Mrs. [redacted] gave us some information about this group (see conclusions). After a short talk, we returned with Mrs. [redacted] in her car to the area of the sighting. Her account is somewhat sketchier than Mrs. [redacted]. It is as follows:

The object was first viewed at point A in the direction indicated. It consisted of two bright red lights and looked like a low-flying airplane. Mrs. [redacted] was quite insistent that there were only two large red lights during the entire incident. Her drawing of the initial sighting at point A is reproduced below:

[Two small circles drawn]

She thinks she saw it intermittently between trees and houses before the car turned west. After the car turned west, progressing through B toward C, the object was in view the whole time. As the car reached C the two lights turned and headed toward the car. Reaching this point B, they seemed to be suspended above the trees and were no longer moving. Mrs. [redacted] described them as about the brightness and color of automobile tail lights. They were, she said, about 4 feet in diameter and about one foot apart and seemed to be rotating or blinking slightly. There could not have been more than 30 feet of ground between the car and the objects. Her drawing of their appearance at point C is below:

[No drawing is actually shown in this section of the document]


- page 59 -

Mrs. [redacted] was again insistent upon the sizes and the fact that there were only two lights. I tried to get her to put her hand at arm's length to see if she could have covered the objects with it. She insisted that she couldn't, although from her description it would have been easy. Apparently the nature of the test was not clear to her.

After the car rounded the corner at C, the lights seemed to start moving again in an easterly direction. She watched them through the car windows. As the car moved toward the intersection near point F, Mrs. [redacted] was certain she could make out a dim yellow light immediately behind the two red ones which she ventured might have been "some sort of cabin light."

Mrs. [redacted] said that the lights seemed to be going in a southeasterly direction by the time the car stopped at F. She said she continued to be able to see it through the car's rear window even after they left point F, until they rounded the curve at point G in the car.

Mrs. [redacted] drawing of the object as it appeared after the car left point C is reproduced below:

[A hand-drawn sketch of lights is present]

Mrs. [redacted] remarked that the night of the sighting was a warm one. She seemed to be of the opinion that the only explanation of this phenomenon was some sort of "extraterrestrial" craft. She stated that she had always been a little skeptical before, but she also admitted that her father had claimed several years earlier to have seen a "flying saucer" just before dawn one morning. (Sounds like Venus.)

Mrs. [redacted] was quite definite about the size and shape of the object, but she seemed somewhat unsure of herself when we went back to the location where the sighting was made.
