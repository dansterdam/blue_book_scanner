CONCLUSIONS
The points B and C on the map are located at the bottom of a wooded out curve. A road passes through the ground around the points at about 30 degrees at most to the level on which the points 
are located. The trees at point B are about 10 feet beyond the street and about 30 feet from the nearest house. The field was about 100 yards in width (east to west). 
There were also some bare trees in the road position (indicated by the across the street from B.
I could find no indication in the area to which the phenomenon could be attributed.
I checked Mrs. - and she did not know of anyone who would be expected in the vicinity. The windshield is set at a 45 degree angle.
The car is not completely soundproof. An airplane motor could not be heard.
Two other facts may have some bearing on the incident: 
1) Some mail in the Naperville area is delivered by helicopter.
2) Mrs. - and the impression after she entered the car and turned the corners at C, heading east. Mrs. - had recollection of this.
There was a report of a similar object seen by a couple in Lisle on the same night. This incident was reported in the Naperville Meadows on the Clark Thursday evening after the sighting.
Mr. - had a letter addressed to the editor of the Naperville Sun from a - resident of Clayton, Georgia, who was apparently in communication with the witness.

UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS
NAPERVILLE, ILLINOIS
8 MARCH 1962

INTRODUCTION
1. This report presents the results of the investigation of an unidentified aerial object sighting which occurred on 8 March 1962 in the Naperville, Illinois area.

DETAILS OF SIGHTING
2. At approximately 2200 hours on 8 March 1962, two observers reported sighting a bright, fast-moving object in the sky over Naperville, Illinois. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from view.

ANALYSIS
3. The object was described as a bright, fast-moving light, possibly a star-like object. No other details were provided regarding the object's size, shape, or maneuverability.

CONCLUSIONS
4. Based on the limited information available, the object sighted could not be conclusively identified. While the description is consistent with a bright star or planet, the reported speed of the object is not typical of such celestial bodies. Further investigation would be required to determine the nature of the unidentified aerial object.

RADAR OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

On 8 March 1962, at approximately 2010 hours, personnel at the Naperville, Illinois radar facility observed an unidentified object on their radar screens. The object was first detected at a range of approximately 40 miles and was tracked for over 20 minutes as it traversed an irregular flight path at an estimated speed of 1500 miles per hour. The object did not appear on any other nearby radar installations and was not observed visually by ground personnel. Analysis of the radar data indicates the object exhibited characteristics consistent with a solid, metallic craft. No further details are available.

REPORT NO. 16-62

16. Detailed Description of Sighting:

At approximately 7:30 on the evening of March 8, 1962, my wife and I were in our backyard when we observed a bright light in the northern sky. The light appeared to be moving in a northeasterly direction at a rather rapid speed. As it approached our position, we could see that it was a disc-shaped object with a glow around the edge. The object appeared to change direction several times and then disappeared from view. The total time of observation was approximately 5 minutes.

The object did not appear to be making any sound and seemed to accelerate and decelerate rather rapidly. There were no known aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.

MRS. ---- ACCOUNT
We talked to Mrs. ---- in her home for a few minutes. She took us in her car (from which the sighting was made) to the instant scourl Her account is as follows:
She was a housewife petty to take a friend to the theatre and was on her way home. The time was about 10:30 P.M. Upon stopping at Intersections, saw through the side window of the car a number of lights, which disappeared in the direction indicated above. She called the attention of Mrs. ----. Mrs. ---- reports that it would be hard to say how many lights there were, but she would guess 6 or 8. Quite low, about up to 15 degrees and similar in color and the tail lights of a car. Their confirmation was as in the distance. Pulling away from the intersection, the two women speculated that the object might be an airplane, but that it had an extraordinary motion unlike any airplane landing or taking off near the nearby airport. O'Hare Field is foreground, but this might be very clear. She thought, but was not sure, that Mrs. ---- had commented about the strange behavior of the object between herself and the car turned west. Bearing west, Mrs. ---- said that she could see the car approached point B. It was about the same altitude as the streetlights, not too far off as estimated in their line of travel. It seemed very much as it first did, although it seemed to be around the farther end of the athletic field of the high school. The two women continued to watch the object as the car approached a stop sign at intersection C. At about 6 (approximately the time they stopped - it was before or after she stopped) the object appeared to turn slightly and disappear.

"like a bus would turn," and began moving toward them. As they reached the point B, the lights were arranged as below:

Mr. said that the three (or four) lights on either side would be about a foot apart and the distance between the two groups would be about 40 feet at a point corresponding to that of the edge of the lights again corresponding to that of a car.

There were two tracts in the field immediately opposite the car. as remembering having seen the tracts during the sighting, but that it was she was concentrating on the lights. The moon was quite big and she took us to the spot where it was about 20 feet in height. Mrs. said that if the object was an airplane, its landing gear would have been in the tracts. apparently the lights were corresponds to something larger than a 180," but she emphasized the fact that shows noise.

When the object reached point B, it will think might be a plane, care to the conclusion that it would not have been behind the car. She immediately burned the corner and proceeded in a block. to the top of the hill where she stopped, turned off the engine, and as she drove north, but Mrs. was watching it.

At the point B, she stopped the car and passed the drivers side, stopping out with one foot. This was the first time down the object without the car window glass intervening. The object appeared to be hovered in a southwesterly direction (indicated by her as she turned in her car).

Up until this point in the incident, Mrs. [REDACTED] had thought there were those of a single object. However, the new formation seemed to be her that there were two objects. After watching the object for a short time, Mrs. [REDACTED] the car and drove Mrs. [REDACTED] home, returning to the area a few minutes later. The whole object was visible to them and appeared to the northwest, hovering low over the ground. They drove to a point from which they could have a better view of the object and saw that it appeared to be metallic and seemed to have some appendages or arms attached to the lower portion. Mrs. [REDACTED] was unable to estimate the speed of the object that the whole incident seemed to happen very fast. She was impressed with airplanes since her husband is a student pilot. She heads the object, the name "flying saucer" and still thinks there is some commonplace explanation.

Transcription of the text in the document:

CASE: AUGUST?

Upon returning Mrs. ---- home we learned that Mrs. ---- had called and wanted to know if we wished to interview her also. We drove with Mrs. ---- to Mrs. ----'s home. We had already spent 10 p.m. when we arrived at her home. We had already learned from Mrs. ---- that she had been contacted by a Wheaton High School group, which was investigating this sighting. They gave us some information about this (see conclusions). After a short talk, we returned with Mrs. ---- to the area of the sighting. Her account is as follows:

The object was first viewed at point A in the direction indicated. It consisted of two bright red lights and looked like a low-flying aircraft. As these bright lights approached, it was quite evident that there were only two lights, side by side, during the entire incident. Her drawing of the initial sighting is reproduced below:

She thinks she saw it intermittently between trees and house lights turned east. After the car turned west, progressing through to object was in view the whole time. As the car reached the two bridges the object was dropping down, suspended above the trees and were no longer moving. Her account about the brightness and color of automobile tail lights, she says, should be taken literally and about one foot apart; and its motion-or blinking distinctly; these could not have been more than three feet of ground between the car and the object. Her drawing of the object is as follows:

- page 59 -

There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. The image shows a page of text from what seems to be a document related to Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text reads as follows:

Mrs. was again insistant upon the sights and the fact that there were only two lights. I tried to get her to put her hand at arm's length to see if she could have covered the objects with it. She insisted that the objects she saw were much larger than that.

After the car stopped, the corner at C, the lights seemed to go directly inward. They switched them through the car and the car was again toward the lights.  Could make out a dim yellow light immediately behind the two which she ventured might have been some sort of cabin light. 

Mrs. stated that the lights seemed to be going in a direction, the car stopped at P. She said she continued to see it through the car's rear window even after they left point that counted as the extra lights.

the drawing of the object as it appeared after these points is reproduced below:

Mrs. stated that the flight of the sighting was a wave motion, rising and falling, from the ground, and the only explanation or phenomenon was some sort of extraterrestrial craft. She stated
always has been a little skeptical before, but she also admitted that on occasion several of us excited to have seen a "flying saucer"
dawn one morning. (Counts like Venus)

but she seemed somewhat uncertain about the size and shape of the objects where the sighting was made.
