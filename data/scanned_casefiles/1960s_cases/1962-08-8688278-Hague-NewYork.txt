DATE: August 22, 1962

I SAW TWO OBJECTS MOVING ACROSS THE SKY AT ALMOST THE SAME COURSE [ illegible marking ] AND SPEED. ONE OBJECT, A APPEARED TO STOP, DIP, AND CONTINUE ON. THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AIRPLANES, BUT WITH MY KNOWLEDGE OF SATELLITES, I DOUBT IT. THERE WAS NO SPECIAL MOVEMENT OTHER THAN THE DIP THEY MOVED ACROSS THE SKY LIKE SATELLITES.

Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:

On August 2, 1962 at exactly 10:35 PM EDST two flying objects were spotted directly overhead. They were flying from the southwest to northeast, and were visible for about three minutes. According to the New York Times the only satellite scheduled to be visible was Echo over New York City at 8:55 PM EDST.

I am sure that neither of the objects were airplanes due to their course and speed, and also because of a dipping motion it seemed to have as it disappeared over the horizon.

Would you please try to identify these UFO's. I was thinking that one or both of them might belong to the USSR. If so, could you please explain why they both appeared at the same time with practically the same course and speed.

I would appreciate a prompt reply. Thank you for your time and trouble.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

Camp Arcady
Hague, New York
(Near Ticonderoga, N.Y.)

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is in reply to your recent letter inquiring about two flying objects that you have been unable to identify.

Since the time of the flights was not that of our Echo satellite as you noted, I am forwarding your inquiry to the Office of Naval Service, Department of the Air Force, Department of Defense, The Pentagon, Washington 25, D. C.

Very sincerely yours,
