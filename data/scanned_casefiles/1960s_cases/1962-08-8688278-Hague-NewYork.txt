The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an object above it that appears to be a UFO or unidentified flying object. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine the object's height above the horizon. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view, with a person standing on a road and two smaller inset sketches showing different landscape perspectives.

OCRED TEXT:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.
33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was at when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when it disappeared. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to NASA in Washington, D.C. from someone at Camp Areley in Hague, New York.

The text of the letter is as follows:

NASA 
Washington, D.C.
Gentlemen:

On August 3, 1962 at exactly 10:35 PM EDST two flying objects were spotted over upstate New York. They were flying the southeast and were visible for about three minutes. According to the New York Times, the only satellite scheduled to be visible was Echo over New York City at 8:55 PM EDST. 

I am quite certain on the sightings, as the objects were quite close and appeared to think and also because of a dipping motion it seemed to have, as it disappeared over the horizon.

Would you please try to identify these UFO's. I was thinking that one or both of them might belong to the U.S.S.R. If so, would you please explain why they both appeared at the same time with practically the same course and speed?

I would appreciate a prompt reply. Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

Camp Areley
Hague, New York
(Near Ticonderoga, N.Y.)

This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains a series of questions and answers related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, or "0" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time, what would have been the angular size of the object?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? THEY DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. IT APPEARED LIKE SATELLITES IN THE SKY, ABOUT THE SAME APPEARANCE TO LOOK LIKE SATELLITES.
