U.F.O.

Dear sir:
I have been a beliver in Unidentified Flying Objects for a long time.
Could I have more information on this subject? Up here the girls say that
people who belive in U.F.O.'s are crazy. If this is true then I am as crazy
as a loon. If it is possible I would like to have a picture of a group
of U.F.O.'s in formation.

Thank you,
