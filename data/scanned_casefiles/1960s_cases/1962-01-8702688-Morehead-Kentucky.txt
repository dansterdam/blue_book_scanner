7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
8 sec

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
8-12

9. COURSE
45°

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
College student, amateur astronomer, out observing stars. "V" shaped, passed overhead. No definite formation but objects flew close together. One object changed position from right to left. Total observation about 8 sec, during which time objects traversed through 45°. No sound or trail. Color white but dull. Movement steady.

11. COMMENTS
Objects flew in group rather than formation. Took 8 sec to cover 45° arc. At low altitude. This is consistent with speed of birds (30-35 mph). There was a street light about 120 ft from observer to the SW. Light from this source probably reflected from the birds and the objects were not identified by the witness as such.

□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft

GENTLEMEN:

ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 28 AT 10:00 P.M. I RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM MY CLOSE FRIEND HE TOLD ME HE HAD OBSERVED A GROUP OF FROM 8 TO 12 OBJECTS PASS OVERHEAD AT APPROX 9:55 P.M. AND HAD IMMEDIATELY CALLED ME. I WENT STRAIGHT OVER TO HIS HOUSE AND QUESTIONED HIM AS TO THE SIGHTING. I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN UFOs FOR SOME TIME, SO AFTER GAINING THE FACTS AS DETAILED TO ME, I TOOK THE REPORT. HERE IS THE STORY TOLD IN HIS OWN WORDS:

AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM CHURCH ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 28 I AS PARKING ON TAKING MY TELESCOPE OUTSIDE TO OBSERVE A FEW CONSTELLATIONS. I PUT OFF GOING OUT UNTIL ABOUT 9:45 P.M. AT THAT TIME I TOOK MY TELESCOPE OUTSIDE AND SAT UP TO GET THE BACK TALK. SINCE IT WAS PARTLY CLOUDY (COLD), I DECIDED TO STAY OUT FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES. BECAUSE THE TELESCOPE RAISED A STAR DIAGONAL AND WAS AIMED TO USE, I USED IT INSTEAD TO USE 3 BY 12 BINOCULARS. SO I TOOK THE TELESCOPE INSIDE AND AFTER LOCATING THE BINOCULARS RETURNED TO THE BACK YARD.

I FIRST OBSERVED THE NEBULA IN ORION, THEN THE PLEIADES AND SOME OTHER CLUSTERS. AFTER I HAD ALMOST FINISHED, I WAS (STILL AS I REMEMBER, LOOKING TOWARD THE CONSTELLATION ORION), WHEN I NOTICED OUT OF THE TOP OF MY EYE A GLOWING LIGHT ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD MOVING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT THIS WAS A METEOR, BUT I KNEW AT ONCE THAT METEORS USUALLY FALL INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT IN GROUPS. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I TRAINED THE GLASSES ON THE LIGHT. I SAW AT ONCE 8 TO 12 OBJECTS, EACH HAVING THE SHAPE OF A "V" WITH A VERTEX ANGLE OF ABOUT 130°. THEY GAVE OFF A BRIGHT BUT NOT A BRILLIANT LIGHT WHICH MADE THE OUTLINE FAIRLY DISTINCT.

THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MASS OF PROPULSION, AND ON THE LEFT NO TRAIL. THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS QUIET AND WHEN I LISTENED FOR A SOUND FROM THE OBJECTS I HEARD NONE. THEY DID NOT FLY IN ANY PERFECT FORMATION, BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THEY WERE WINGTIP TO WINGTIP, SOME BEING A LITTLE AHEAD OF THE OTHERS. AS FEW PROJECTED WESTWARD ON TOP OF THE OBJECTS FLEW AS A LITTLE BEHIND THE OTHERS AND NEAR THE RIGHT SIDE, MOVED OVER TO THE LEFT OF THE GROUP.

THE OBJECTS WERE FIRST SIGHTED ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD IN THE CONSTELLATION GEMINI AND MOVED STEADILY WESTWARD PASSING NEAR THE UPPER PORTION OF THE CONSTELLATION ORION. THEY VANISHED ABOUT 45° ABOVE THE WESTERN HORIZON. FROM THE OBSERVATION TO THE LOSING OF THE OBJECTS ABOUT 5 SECONDS ELAPSED.

AFTER GOING INTO THE HOUSE AND REPORTING THE INCIDENT TO MY PARENTS I RETURNED OUTSIDE FOR ANOTHER LOOK, BUT AFTER SEEING NOTHING MORE UNUSUAL I CALLED --- AND TOLD HIM OF MY SIGHTING. HE SAID HE WOULD GO OUT AND NOTICE THAT THE SKY WAS BECOMING OVERCAST AND ONLY THE BRIGHTER STARS WERE VISIBLE.

SO I RETURNED TO MY ROOM, GOOD --- SAT, A.P. AND PLOTTED THE PATH OF THE OBJECTS. WHEN --- ARRIVED WE DISCUSSED THE SIGHTING AND I RELATED THE FACTS TO HIM AS HE ASKED QUESTIONS AND TOOK NOTES.

I HAVE KNOWN --- HE AND I STARTED SCHOOL TOGETHER. IN MY OPINION HE IS A SERIOUS, INTELLIGENT, LEVEL HEADED BOY, NOT PRONE TO MAKE UP STORIES FOR ANY REASON. IT IS MY FIRM BELIEF THAT THE STATEMENT HE HAS RENDERED ABOVE IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH.

DETAILS OF SIGHTING

1. TIME OF SIGHTING: APPROXIMATELY 9:55 PM

2. LOCATION OF OBJECTS: FIRST SIGHTED IN CENTER OF GEMINI CONSTELLATION, PASSING ABOVE ORION IN BETWEEN ORION AND TAURUS.

3. MOVEMENT OF OBJECTS: IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. STEADY RAPID MOVEMENT.

4. DESCRIPTION: 8 TO 12 "V" SHAPED OBJECTS WITH A VERTEX ANGLE OF ABOUT 130°. BRIGHT BUT NOT BRILLIANT LIGHT. NO DEFINITE FORMATION BUT FLEW CLOSE TOGETHER. ONE OBJECT CHANGED POSITION FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. IN SIGHT ABOUT 8 SECONDS. OBJECTS TRAVERSED ABOUT 45° OF SKY BEFORE BEING LOST 45° ABOVE HORIZON. NO MEANS OF PROPULSION VISIBLE. LEFT NO TRAIL.

5. TEMPERATURE AT TIME OF SIGHTING: APPROXIMATELY 25° F.

6. THERE IS A STANDARD LOW WATTAGE STREETLIGHT INCANDESCENT TYPE LOCATED 120 ft. FROM SPOTTING POSITION IN A SOUTHWEST DIRECTION.

7. A CHECK WAS MADE WITH A LOCAL PROFESSOR AT MOREHEAD STATE COLLEGE WHO IS A BIRDWATCHER. HIS CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE OBJECTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT PROBABLY WERE NOT BIRDS.

8. BINOCULARS USED WERE 4 POWER, 50 MM TYPE

9. OBSERVER WAS AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER WHO HAS SEEN METEORITES, AIRCRAFT, BIRDS, AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA BEFORE.

10. BALLOON MAY BE RULED OUT BECAUSE OBJECT WAS TRAVELING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF WIND WHICH BROUGHT CLOUDS OUT OF THE WEST.

11. NO UNUSUAL RADIO OR TV INTERFERENCE WAS NOTICED AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
College student, amateur astronomer, out observing stars. Objects no definite formation but the objects flew close together. One object changed position from right to left. Total observation about eight seconds, during which time the objects traversed through 45 degrees. No sound or trail. Color white but dull. Movement steady.

EVALUATION: CASE CATEGORY: Other (Birds)

CONCLUSION: Objects flew in group rather than formation. It took eight seconds to cover 45 degrees arc. At low altitude this is constant with the speed of birds (about 30-35 mph). There was a street light about 120 ft. from the observer to the southwest. Its probable that light reflected from the birds and the objects were not identified by the witness as such.
