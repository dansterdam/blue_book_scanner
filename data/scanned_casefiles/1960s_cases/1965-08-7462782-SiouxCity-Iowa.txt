11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Two round red fiery objects side by side ("pretty close"). Appeared only as a ball of fire. Circling above the two red objects was a red and green flickering object. Observed at 25 deg elevation moving slowly to the south. In sight for 1 minute. Sighting at twilight. Disappeared at 25 deg elevation. Flight in direction of Air Base from the observer. Duration of less than one minute conflicts with sky flight. Disappearance not noted in report. No mention of the degrees of arc above the red objects that the red and green flickering object was located. No association established between the objects. No sound, exhaust trail or other features noted. Laity has an active imagination and the quality of the data leaves something to be desired. Multiple sightings from this area during the month. No follow-up in view of the quality of information furnished by the witness, recorded as INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR VALUATION.
