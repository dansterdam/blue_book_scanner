Statement of Lt. Miller:

An "Unidentified Project Officer for Ground Sighting" had been alerted to the expected re-entry of the Russian Rocket 1960 Epsilon II. The rocket was fired from the Kazakhstan area on 18 July. I requested that the local AACS and Weather Observer Assistants be alerted to watch for the rocket and report any sightings. 

At about 0615Z I received the report from TSgt [redacted] concerning the object he saw at about 0600Z. Major Harrison, the Weather Officer, was notifying this sighting report at about this same time. Major Harrison, Sgt Anderson and myself studied the reports and agreed on the contents. After comparing times, I see that I inadvertently reported the time of Anderson's sighting as 1912Z rather than 0912Z.

From about 0831Z until 1032Z, Major Harrison, Sgt. Anderson, Airman Fletcher, and I observed the object. We could find no logical explanation on the matter. The sightings of Sgt. Anderson and Airman Fletcher were some 95 minutes apart, and I assumed that these sightings of the same object.

The duration varied from a few seconds to about a minute. The object appeared reddish-orange in color and the diameter of the larger piece. The object appeared reddish-orange in color and about the size of a golf ball as it flashed on then off, slowly increasing and decreasing in brilliance, and visible to the naked eye for approximately three to four seconds.

that, at 07312z 7 July 1960, he had observed a flash of brilliant green light brighter than moonlight which seemed to come from an object about the size of an orange held at arm's length and lighting up one-half of the sky. The object appeared in the air and remained visible for fifteen to twenty times longer than the diameter of the object. The object was visible for suitable for several seconds. The brilliant visible light fifteen to twenty times longer than the diameter of the object, and basic information was confirmed by A/C Pitcher also on duty at the Chanute Air Force Base.

A/1C Boudreaux, Project Officer had been alerted for possible re-entry of Satellite 1958 ALPHA from 0730Z 6 June to 0730Z 7 July. After reported sightings at 0730Z on 7 July, the object of the 0952 sighting is believed to be the possible re-entry of Satellite 1958 ALPHA. An inquiry of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory confirms that the re-entry of Satellite 1958 ALPHA could case starting to re-enter the earth's atmosphere. No further sightings have been reported as of 2 July 1960.

RECOMMENDATIONS: In that all possible leads indicate the possibility of a re-entry of a satellite, it is recommended that no further action be taken at this station.
