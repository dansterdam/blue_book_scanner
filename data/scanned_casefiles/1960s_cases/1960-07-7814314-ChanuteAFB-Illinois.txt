Statement of Lt. Miller:

As "Moondust" Project Officer for Chanute Air Force Base I had been alerted to the expected re-entry of the Russian Rocket 1960 Epsilon II. The information furnished me by CONATG, Randolph Air Force Base, Incirlik, indicated the rocket was due to re-enter the earth's atmosphere during the period from late June through mid-July. I requested that the local AAC and Weather Detachment Commanders alert the control tower and weather observer personnel to be on the lookout for the re-

At 0615Z I received the report from TSgt [redacted] concerning the object he saw at the drive-in movie. Just after transmitting this sighting report, at about 0800Z, Major Harrison, the Weather Detachment Commander, reported the sighting made by SSgt Anderson. I transmitted this sighting also. After comparing notes with Captain Nathan on this date (14 July), I see that I inadvertently reported the time of Sgt. Anderson's sighting as 1931Z rather than 0731Z.

From about 0831Z until 1031Z, Major Harrison, Sgt. Anderson, Airman Fletcher, and myself posted ourselves on the roof of the remote observing site in hopes of again sighting the object. We made no sightings. As the sightings were some 95 minutes apart, I assumed that these sightings were of the orbiting rocket.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING
Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois - 2 July 1960

AUTHORITY: AFR 200-2 dated 14 September 1959, unclassified message AFCTN-462-7-2096-E, 8 July 1960 from ATIC Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and Special Order A-393 dated 12 July 1960, Hq Chanute Technical Training Center (ATC)

PROCEEDINGS OF THE INVESTIGATION: On 13 and 14 July 1960, Capt. G. W. Nathan AO755396, 3345th Air Base Group, Chanute Technical Training Center (ATC) appointed by Special Order A-393, Hq Chanute Technical Training Center, 12 July 1960, proceeded to investigate the sighting of a UFO on the morning of 2 July 1960. During the investigation, the following persons were contacted and interviewed in accordance with paragraph 15, AFR 200-2:

[Several names are redacted, but the document lists:]
- Det. 3, 8th Weather Group, Chanute AFB, Ill.
- Chanute AFB, Illinois
- Det. 3, 8th Weather Gp., Chanute AFB
- 1963rd AACS, Chanute AFB, Illinois
- 1963rd AACS, Chanute AFB, Illinois
- Dept. of Weather and Moondust Project Officer, Chanute AFB, Illinois

FINDINGS: After careful evaluation of the facts disclosed by persons contacted and on interview with the Moondust Project Officer, Lt. Miller of Chanute AFB, it was found that:

a. SMgt and Mrs. [redacted] observed the flash of greenish-white light in the NE quadrant of the sky at 0231Z, 2 July 1960 and a flash of light of the same intensity and color again 90 minutes later at 0400Z in the East quadrant of the sky and a third time about 180 minutes after the second sighting at 0730Z in the NW quadrant of the sky. All findings were at an elevation of 120° relative to the horizon.

b. TSgt [redacted] while attending a drive-in theatre two miles west of Chanute Air Force Base, observed an egg-shaped ball of light about the size of a pea held at arm's length grow to the size of a dime held at arm's length break into two pieces. The smaller piece trailing a larger piece approximately one-half the diameter of the larger piece. The object appeared reddish-orange in color in the East quadrant of the sky at about 100° elevation, at 0545Z 2 July 1960, traveling South and rapidly fading at an elevation of 20°. The object was visible to SSgt [redacted] for approximately three to four seconds.

c. SSgt [redacted] on duty at the remote Weather Observation Tower, reported

that, at 0732Z 2 July 1960, he had observed a flash of brilliant green light brighter than any light he had ever seen being emitted from an object about the size of an orange held at arm's length and lighting up one-half of the sky.

The object appeared in the NW quadrant of the sky at an elevation of 70 to 60° travelling southward slowly fading at an elevation of 45° leaving a trail or visible light fifteen to twenty times longer than the diameter of the object.

The object was visible to Sgt. Anderson for five seconds. The trail of visible light lasted for fifteen to twenty seconds after the object disappeared. This sighting and basic information was confirmed by A3C Fletcher also on duty at the Weather Tower and SSgt Gerard on duty at the Control Tower, both located at Chanute AFB.

d. The Moondust Project Officer had been alerted for possible re-entry of a Russian satellite late in June or early July. After reported findings at 0730Z and 0402Z, Sgt Anderson at 0730Z, and the fact that the Moondust Project Officer had been alerted for the possible re-entry of a Satellite, the re-entry of a Satellite was seen likely. An inquiry of the Smithsonian Institute of pre-calculated orbital data of known satellites could confirm that the object sighted was a spent Russian satellite or a spent rocket case starting to re-enter the earth's atmosphere. No further sightings have been reported at Chanute Air Force Base since the morning of 2 July 1960.

RECOMMENDATIONS: In that all possible leads indicate the possibility of re-entry of a satellite, it is recommended that no further action be taken at this station.
