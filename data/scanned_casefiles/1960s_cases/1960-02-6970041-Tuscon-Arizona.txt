PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 21 February, 1950
2. LOCATION: Tucson, Arizona
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2315
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. DURATION: 3-10 minutes
6. SOURCE: Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-10 minutes
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
9. COURSE: Varied
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: An object about the size of a half-dollar with an intensity about the same as the edge of a silvery cloud was observed moving in a scattered path, with sudden changes in direction and speed. The object faded out twice during the observation, with the observation made into getting into better position for observation became the object faded out. No sound or trail was noticed.
11. COMMENTS: Reliable reflection, also random in nature. 2-10 minutes will not give much further information. Seems to be more or less standard type of observation from unknown source.

The second sketch appears to show a wider landscape view with a figure in the center and some geometric shapes. The third sketch shows a narrow, cone-shaped object.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

Your letter contains insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, I must ask you to furnish your wife's completed questionnaire as soon as possible. The information requested therein is essential for this office's technical intelligence evaluation.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Tucson, Arizona
February 29, 1960

Dear Sir,

On Wednesday evening, February 24, my wife and I were returning from a drive which we had taken to the eastern section of Tucson. We were driving along Fourth Street, Broadway Avenue, apparently 3 or 4 miles east of the center of town. The sun had just set behind the mountains.

My wife called my attention to a white streak in the sky. It was traveling east and slanted by our windshield. I took it for a jet contrail, but it did not lengthen or spread. I pulled to the side of the road and we both got out to look closely. It was about the size of a half dollar held at arm's length.

It seemed to be over the southern part of the city, over the mountains to the south, but continued to move slightly, not-indicating, the same color as a contrail. After a while it started to disappear, changing direction slightly and climbing at varying angles. At one point the rays seemed to spread.

(Later, in discussing this with my wife, we both draw illustrations of what our impression had been without letting the other see what we were sketching. Our impressions did not differ.

At about 6:25 two diagonal streaks of light left the upper and lower parts of this same object, the original. They circled about, drawing near the original, then departed again. They left behind no trail or smoke. It was possibly jet planes stunting and we wondered if the "contrails" preceded. The original object continued to be visible. Only that remained visible.

The object continued to glide over a limited portion of the sky, changing direction quickly, and angling back and forth. Then it started to diminish, growing smaller and smaller until the rays no longer showed. The rear part of it went first.

Next morning I called Davis-Monthan Air Base and the local newspaper and told them that anyone else had reported anything. There were other planes in the sky at the time but all heading away from it. When we had first stopped a I motioned plane was well away from it to the north.

Since Wednesday the sky has had rather heavy cloud cover to the west. We have been driving out and watching the sky again. we have not noticed but a light reflection, both because of the cloudy shape and because of the strange effects of "might that looks off and then vanishes to the distant."

Is any of this of interest to you?

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

The text in the document reads:

Dear Sir,
Our Wednesday sighting of some bright moving objects in the sky on February 29, 1960.
At approximately 7:30 PM my husband and I were outside watching a meteor shower when suddenly several bright orange objects appeared in the sky. They appeared to be much higher than the aircraft we are used to seeing and were moving at a very rapid rate of speed. At first we thought they might be satellites, but after observing them for some time, we realized they were not satellites, as they would suddenly change direction and speed. They seemed to be under some type of intelligent control. 
After a few minutes, the objects began to gradually fade and disappear. There were no sounds associated with them that we could hear.
At approximately 8:00 PM, a few of the objects reappeared and seemed to be maneuvering in a methodical fashion, sometimes appearing to hover and then darting off at great speed. They continued this type of maneuver for approximately 15 minutes and then gradually faded from view.
We were both quite amazed at what we saw and feel that it was definitely not any type of conventional aircraft. I am enclosing a rough sketch of what we observed, although it does not do justice to the actual sight.
If you have any questions or would like any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

Transcribing the text:

The young man thought a bit than said "Lets go up on the hill and watch it come in; I think it will be back." We proceeded up the hill and took up a position to watch for the return of the object. After about 15 minutes we saw the object coming in from the southeast at an approximate altitude of about 1000 feet. It appeared to be round and glowing with a bluish-greenish light. As it approached our position it slowed down and hovered for several minutes directly over us at an altitude estimated at about 500 feet. 
The object made no sound at all and was quite large, possibly 30 to 40 feet in diameter. After hovering for several minutes it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared out of sight to the northwest. We waited for some time but the object did not return.
