Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 29 February 1960 regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object by you and your wife on the evening of 24 February in Tucson, Arizona.

Your letter contains insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, request you and your wife complete the attached Air Force questionnaire in regard to the sighting and forward the completed papers to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for analysis and evaluation.

Tucson, Arizona
February 29, 1960

Dear Sir,

On Wednesday evening, February 24, my wife and I were returning from a drive which we had taken to the eastern section of Tucson. We were traveling west on East Broadway Avenue and were approximately 9 miles east of the center of town. The sun had just set behind the mountains. The sky was mostly clear, with a few banks of colored clouds.

My wife called my attention to a white streak in the sky. It was traveling east and was fanned by our windshield. I took it for a jet contrail, but it did not lengthen or spread. I pulled to the side of the road and we both left the car to study it more closely. It was 6:20 P.M.

It seemed to be over the southern part of the city, over the mountains to the west, but continued to move east. It appeared to be a band of white light, non-radiating, the same color as a contrail. After a while it started to maneuver, changing direction quickly, and slanting at various angles. At one point I saw, very dimly, a globe shape behind the band of light.

(Later, in discussing this with my wife, we both drew illustrations of what our impression had been without letting the other see what we were sketching. She drew a similar sketch)

At about 6:25 two diagonal streaks of light left the upper and lower parts of the band, breaking off when they were of the same length as the original. They circled about, straying near the first band, then looped and came back toward it. Once again I thought that possibly it was three jet planes stunting and watched to see if the "contrails" crossed. The two additional streaks, however, seemed to be absorbed back into the original band. Only that remained visible.

The object continued to "glide" over a limited portion of the sky, changing direction quickly and angling back and forth. Then it started to gently rise and head in a southerly direction, gradually growing fainter. It did not grow smaller so much as fade. The rear part of it went first, then the rest. This was at 6:28.

Next morning I called Davis-Monthan Air Base and the local newspaper and was told no-one else had reported anything. There were other planes in the sky at the time but all heading away from it. When we had first stopped a motored plane was pulling away from it to the north.

- page 14 -

Since Wednesday the sky has had fairly heavy cloud cover to the west. We have been driving out and watching the sky each evening but have not seen it again. We are certain what we saw was a material object and not a light reflection, both because of the globular shape and because of the two marks of "light" that broke off and then returned to the object.

Is any of this of interest to you?

Sincerely yours,

/s/

Tucson, Arizona
February 29, 1960

Dear Sir,

On Wednesday evening, February 24, my wife and I were returning from a drive outside the Pima to the eastern sector of Tucson. We were heading west and East Broadway Avenue and were approximately off Davis out of the center of town. The sun had just set behind the mountains. The sky was mostly clear, with a few bands of cloud, dark. My wife called my attention to a total streak in the sky. It was heading east and was viewed by our windshield. I pulled it for a jet control, but it did not lengthen or spread. I pulled to the side of the road and we left the car to study it more closely. It was 6:20 P.M.

It seemed to be over the southern part of the city, just the mountains to the west hit continued to move about. It appeared to be a band of white light, was rotating, the same above a certain after a while it started to maneuver, leaving direction quickly, but slowing at various angles. It was very clearly a side shape behind a band of light.

[ Later in discussing this with my wife, we both have observations of what our impressions had been. Little else other see what we were studying. Like there a similar object at about 6:25 two diagonal streaks of light left the upper and lower parts of the band, breaking off voluntarily... ]

She light continued to glide over a light put of

Since relatively they have had fairly heavy close
contact to the next. We have been seeing only lately
they and wing lot have not seen it again & are still
to ye now was a material object and not a light reflec
