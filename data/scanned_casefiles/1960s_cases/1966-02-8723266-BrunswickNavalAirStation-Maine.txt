PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - Time Group: 16 February 66 16/2330Z
2. LOCATION: Brunswick Naval Air Station, Maine

3. SOURCE: Civilian & Military

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 1/2 Hours

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: Hovering, quick starts

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION:
1. Astro (JUPITER)
2. INSUFFICIENT DATA

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Object was described as being 15 ft thick with red, blue, and green lights around the edges which flashed erratically. The objects seemed to hover for periods then make quick starts and stops. A second object which was not mentioned in the initial report, was reported on the follow-up 164 to clarify the first object three times then seemed to land.

The description of the first object is with no doubt a star/planet sighting. Jupiter (RA 5.21) is at 229 deg azimuth and 60.8 deg elevation at 2030L, and ______ Stellar mag -2.0. Therefore it is of my opinion that the observer was evidentially confused in direction and was looking to the west rather than the east. The second object was probably an A/C. However the data is insufficient to make an evaluation as such.

Object would have covered match head at least
Ten times.

Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Brief summary which might be clearer:

Spotted UFO - Succeeded in following it to landing point, approximately 3 miles away. When object landed, light colors and changed from red, blue, green to depth - salmon color. It was a fixed light, did not flicker. UFO seemed to move every 10 or 15 minutes & seemed to follow the pattern (example 26). After approximately 30 to 45 minutes, the 2nd UFO left. Wandering point - we did not see where it went. Seemed to move in an easterly direction and then faded. About 30 minutes later, the 2nd or 3rd UFO appeared from a south-easterly direction and circled the area. It came very close to ground (this is what saw the shape of object). It then landed about 1 1/2 miles between the car & the 1st UFO. It was impossible to see the UFO because it was in the trees. About every 10 minutes, object would flicker - then go off - color seemed white. A short while after (am not sure of time) the light of the 1st UFO went off completely. Friend & myself left, about 20 minutes later we returned & parked the car about 1/2 mile further than we were. We stopped at that particular spot because the 2nd & large light colored light & we assumed it was the 2nd UFO. We stayed there about 5 minutes. It went off - about 5 minutes.
