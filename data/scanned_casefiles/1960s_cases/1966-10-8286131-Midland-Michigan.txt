Observers noted 4 star like objects in the northwest that appeared to be following each other in an irregular formation. They described the objects as being larger than stars and brighter. The objects seemed to change direction and altitude and were moving slowly toward the north. It is possible that these were Echo II satellite.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

and apparently its red light, it continued to eastward. We were about 37 miles northeast of Midland, Michigan, and were driving on highway M-20 at the time. The object appeared to be about 1500 feet up and traveling at a high rate of speed, it never stopped or slowed down, it continued on and made no sound whatsoever. 

We finally clocked the time.

8:05 p.m. cst on our action. We are another 3 minutes of the object's sighting. So the first 3 minutes we were trying to decide if what we saw was real. It disappeared from sight as we lost it across the horizon.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:         -3-        NOVFMBER          1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

While driving home from work near Midland, Michigan that we assume that it was a large aircraft. At the time we assumed that it was a high altitude jet. However, later we realized that it could not have been a normal jet aircraft. The object was stationary and hovered over our house (which we could not find an account of the time) when we first observed it, the object appeared to be rounded or circular in shape and its color was bright and metalic like (sic) chrome or aluminum. It appeared to be over 300 feet in diameter and we estimate that it was hovering at an altitude of 300 to 400 feet. After observing it for several minutes it departed: two to the east, one headed south. The one traveling south began a rapid rate of speed and disappeared from view, while the other two reappeared and continued their easterly course. While observing the object, we had no idea what it was and it was not making any sound. We were quite certain that it could not have been any type of aircraft or helicopter that we are familiar with. After the object departed, we were left with a feeling of awe and wonderment as to what we had just witnessed. We are still trying to come to a logical explanation and would appreciate any assistance or information you may be able to provide.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report.

Here is the text from the document:

Upon its arrival, the object appeared suddenly and silently a a considerable distance away, according to the witness, and it was a large, luminous, round object. As it came closer, it appeared to be the size of a large aircraft, with a dome or saucer-shaped upper portion and a flatter, circular lower portion. The object was brilliant white in color and seemed to emit its own light, rather than reflecting light from the moon, which was visible at the time.

The object maneuvered and hovered, at times appearing to wobble or oscillate, and it moved at a rapid rate of speed, estimated at over 1,000 mph. It moved in an erratic, zig-zag fashion, making sharp turns and abrupt changes in direction and altitude. At times, it appeared to accelerate away at extreme speeds, only to slow down and hover again.

The witness estimated the object was 1,000 to 2,000 feet in altitude and was observed for a total of about 15 minutes. No noise was heard from the object, and it gave off no exhaust or trail. After its final rapid departure, the witness reported that the sky appeared to be distorted or "wavy" in the area where the object had been.

"It's conspicuous, for a light (in the sky), to be stopped here and there over the low chemical company's reservoir, where this the real lights seemed to be standing up upon the turning. As it was climbing up, and watching it for some time, it soon stopped and stood for over a minute as a brilliant object, the sky light seemed to diminish. It reversed completely and rose and disappearred into the trees.

Partial occured the light was green which our attention was drawn to compare of the objects in the south. It reversed its direction diminishing it? and disappeared for the night."
