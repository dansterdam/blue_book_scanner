11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted a star like object in the sky that was much brighter than star around it. At first, they thought it to be a bright planet or star. When the observer first saw it, it was stationary, while it began to move toward north. With binoculars the object looked like it had a halo, while a light appeared over this area. Some other observers saw these red lights repeated in different directions.

The descriptions are consistent with some of aircraft observations and a satellite confirmation. The object that was moving slowly, toward the north east was Echo satellite.

and resuming its red light, it continued westward. We were astounded
when: its front and spirited as a brilliant green; the red light
ceased (again) and, with out stepping or slowing, it reversed
completely and settled itself eastward into old trees.

We finally checked the time - 8:05 pm. then our attention
was drawn to another of the objects in the east, which re-
peated the reversing operation, identically as the first, and
disappeared for the night.

While leaving our home at approximately 7:25, we noticed a "star" in the east that was much more brilliant than those surrounding it. At the time we assumed that it was a large planet. As we proceed west we observed it to glow progressively brighter, but it did remain stationary. We were a quarter mile away from the house (with no possible account of the time) when still idea of O.F.O.'s control or might "with" its intensity, brightness, and dimness. Standing still for 3 or 4 min after (and observing it with two telephone poles (power lines), we saw it motivate itself; ascend, descend, and proceed northward slowly. Upon this surprising observation, we hurried to our home. One of us remained outside and the other ran for the binoculars. During that time, the object had increased its speed and lowered its altitude. (With the binoculars (Site approx. Nc 35), we saw when a red light appeared (for the first time) positioned over the first light, that could distinctly, similarly, red opposite appeared from the north and converged in the east with the first. After several minutes they separated: two to the north, one behind the trees; one to the north-south. One then slowly began a rapid series of red flashes in a very erratic pattern. At that time we sighted an airplane from the southwest, traveling east-north-east, at a low altitude.

When we retreated to the roof of our house, were we followed by the part of the north-bound object. Okay, traveling west with its constant and light (no dim) light (no dim) over the Dow Chemical reservoir area. (At which time she saw light descend and she twilight light returned.) Often, picking up speed...

Upon leaving our home approximately (1/2) an hour later "after" in the east west that much more brighter than those surrounding it, we noticed that it was a large placenta as we proceeded west we observed it to drift progressively northerly, but it did remain stationary. We were a quarter mile from our home (with no precise account of the time) when the wild mass of two general our view... with the object suddenly increased its intensity, brightness, and diameter for the final size) remaining still for three or four minutes and slightly to the telephone poles, as may be noted in the drawing, and proceeding northward slowly. Upon this surviving, observation we returned back to our home. One of us remained outside and then to a pen for the binoculars, noting then that the object was hovering its space, its location, its altitude.

Its collecting, Ft. light (in one book), is stopped here and there over the Dow Chemical Company's reservoir area(at which time the red light course and the white light alternated). Then, picking up speed and resuming its red light, it continues westward. We were astonished: it lit one isolated as a brilliant green; the red light ceased(within)only without slowing down or stopping, it reverses completely and retarded itself somewhat into the trees.

We finally checked the time: 9:05 p.m. Our attention was drawn to another of the objects in the east. It repeated the reversing operation (instantly at one light) and disappeared for the night.

Memo for the Record:

At approximately 2351Z 17 Oct. 66 Echo II was over 79.24 AOI and on a northerly heading.

It appears that the initial observation was of the star Capella which was rising in the NNE part of the sky prior to the observation. At 1835 EST or 1935 EDT Capella was at 28 degrees AZ and at an elevation of about 9 degrees.
