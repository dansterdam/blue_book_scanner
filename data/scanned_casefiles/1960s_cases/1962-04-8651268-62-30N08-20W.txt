Mario Zuccala's Strange Encounter
By Beccarelli Silvano

The author of this article worked closely with Professor Thayahe Director of C.I.R.N OS, the Italian UFO investigative body, until his death which deprived it of her greatest student and case in this field. The following incident was fully reported in a number of Italian newspapers and magazines.

[The rest of the text continues, describing Mario Zuccala's encounter on April 10, 1962, near San Casciano, Val di Pesa. The text details a UFO sighting and encounter, including descriptions of a hovering object and two beings emerging from it.]

The page includes three diagrams of a UFO/flying saucer at the bottom, with a scale of 2.50 metres indicated.

Five days prior to this event at Modesta, California on April 13, 1962 five teenagers reported a strange, glowing light slowly descending at 500 feet altitude and becoming brighter as it neared the ground. The eyewitnesses started to get out of their car, but found themselves physically affected by their encounter. Their bodies became numb all over and for a time they could hardly move. All of them were visibly frightened by their experience.

EIRE:
Co. Meath sighting

Miss Ellen W. O'Leary at Trim, Co. Meath writes to tell us of her recent hearing. "Walking to the shop this afternoon, I had a very open view of the Co. Meath sky very flat and expansive. I was walking and happened to glance upward and saw a bright object in the sky which I shaped like a barrel being on side and most of it round and bright. It was stationary. It was dark in color, made of metal, where the sun's rays touched it, it had a brighter number and brighter than the rest of the sky. It was low in the sky, and I could see several features. The top part was brightly lit between a solid and misty light. I was the same shape as before, and I made an angle to begin, and I have ever seen. I was puzzled and wondered what it could be. Then I noticed now moving, there was a pause just at this moment I heard a sound of an approaching noise and I turned my head to look backwards but could see nothing moving to low countries on the horizon. The movement I made would take me out and I had two accounts at once. When I looked forward and my eyes again saw the barrel, not into clouds, but just were more, just an immense expanse of very blue sky, and the sun shining.

"It was about 4 p.m. and the whole episode could not have been more than 25 to 30 seconds in the first visiting to the conversation. The place I had seen and now seen, confirmed to me to the south, and the sound I gradually faded away. The way I saw was travelling north- west and disappeared."

NCR NEWS LETTER for March 24, 1962

ASTRONOMY

Venus Becomes More Prominent
Venus will be seen in the evening sky during the month of April and will increase in prominence during the spring, summer and autumn, James Stokley reports.

DURING MARCH Venus began to appear bright in the evening sky after sunset, thus ending a period with no prominent evening planets. But in April Venus draws farther to the east of the sun, thus remaining visible after sunset in the west for a longer time. In fact, by the end of April it reaches a position so that it can be shown on the accompanying map.

These depict the sky as it appears about 10 p.m., your own kind of standard time, at the first of April, an hour earlier at the middle, and two hours earlier at the end. At the beginning of April Venus sets about an hour and three-quarters after the sun, before twilight is entirely over. However, it is so brilliant (about minus 3.3 on the astronomical magnitude scale) that you can see it easily even when the sky is still quite bright. Four weeks after that Venus sets more than an hour later in timeâ€”about half an hour longer after sunset.

During the rest of spring, summer and early autumn, Venus will continue to increase in prominence in the evening sky.

Study Stars to the South
If you want to get acquainted with the stars of April evenings, a good place to start is high in the southern sky. At the right hand of the sky chart, the constellation Virgo forms the shape of a sickle, as indicated on the southern sky map. At the bottom, to, at the end of the handle, is the first magnitude star, Spica.

Extending from just below Denebola, downward to the left, is a conspicuous constellation of Virgo, the virgin. Its brightest star, another of the first magnitude, is Spica.

Above Virgo stands Bootes, with brilliant Arcturus, which is about two and three-quarters as bright as Regulus.

A few constellations that were conspicuous in the south on winter evenings can still be seen in the west. Some are on the northern map, some on the southern. One of these is Taurus, the bull, in which Venus now appears. The star Aldebaran is near the planet and, although it is another first magnitude star, it appears considerably fainter because it is now low in the sky.

Its light is deflected by the great thickness of our atmosphere through which it has to travel.

First magnitude stars. It is dimmed, of course, by atmospheric absorption, when it first appears above the horizon.

Jupiter follows, about an hour later. It is more than 2.5 times as bright as Saturnâ€”the next brightest planet. In the west, Venus and Saturn are both low in the west, with Saturn a little lower. Mars appears. Somewhat fainter than Saturn, it will be low in the west.

At the end of April Mars will be about an hour and a quarter ahead of the sun. Jupiter nearly 2.5 hours ahead and Saturn more than 3.5 hours ahead; then they will be even more conspicuous.

Largest Constellation Is Faint
On earth, the biggest land area is not necessarily the most important. Similarly in the sky, the largest constellation is not the most prominent. In fact, the largest is now visible in its entirety in our southern sky, but you will have to make a special effort to locate it. This is Hydra, the water-snake. The head is between Regulus and Procyon. The end of the tail is below Spica.

Sizes of constellations are measured in the unit called a square degree, i.e., a square one degree on a side. There are 50 degrees from the horizon to the zenith. And the apparent diameter of the full moon is half a degree; thus the side of our unit square is equal to two lunar diameters. Hydra covers about 1,303 square degrees in the sky, more than any other constellation.

These two little men took side of him gently under his arm and, looking around, saw no other persons. Signor Zaccala was up in three steps and went inside. The mirror was empty and nothing at all was reflected. He looked over with the same light which he had seen from outside. Signor Zaccala did not notice any detail in the interior of the object.

The two friends left him and Signor Zaccala remembers that he was about three steps from the object and does not remember having any reply. In their hand Zaccala was holding a camera from the two beings with him but from the camera came no photo.

This voice now, speaking in a loud voice, was somewhat like one amplified by a microphone and as if resonding in a vast space.

This voice, speaking in Italian, spoke several sentences by him of which Signor Zaccala remembers the important which is not down here.

We shall give notice of this to another person in order to make that which you have seen is true.

It now remains to decide whether by the formal report this case will be taken into consideration, the year which we did then be the full moon of April 20, 1962, or whether is meant from now reckoning from 1st day of the sighting. The two beings, Signor Zaccala said, were found himself at a point 345 p.m. without remembering exact a modest distance by the event which takes his camera. One light violent knock at the...

                        Tailor Talks To Saucer Men

A young Toscan, Italy tailor has claimed that he not only saw a "flying saucer," but talked to the occupants who told him that "humanity will soon receive a message." The gist of it is this:
After spending the evening with a friend

Mario Zuccula, 27, from Cerbais, near Florence, went to his home, skirting the cemetery. Suddenly he felt a current of air behind him and looked around. He was nearly paralyzed with fear when he saw an object, about 30 feet in diameter, appearing to be of whitish metal suspended in the air a few feet from the ground. Zuccula said a sort of metallic cylinder detached itself from the object and came to the ground. From a door through which an intense light radiated, came two small men "about 4Â½ feet tall." The date: 11 April 1962.

The small "men" approached Zuccula, and he noted their heads were covered with a sort of hood. They lifted the man bodily off the ground and took him into the saucer where, with a serious tone, which seemed to come from an amplifier, one of them told him that "at the end of the fourth moon, about one hour from morning, we will return to give a message to humanity."

Without realizing the rest of the adventure, Mr. Zuccula found himself before his house. His wife opened the door for him, reproaching him for being so frightened, then stated that she hadn't opened the door. Because of the strange nature of his tale and his obvious emotional upset, Mrs. Zuccula and her father advised Mario to go to the authorities and tell the story in confidence. This is the end of the information contained in the newspaper. It should be noted here that the "amplifier" is a new touch in a contact story, as is the "cylinder" gadget which apparently brought the little men to the ground. In evaluating this, it is necessary to recognize the existence of two factors: The cemetery and the "cold gust of air," both of which are frequently connected with paranormal happenings. We do not attempt to disqualify the story as to authenticity but feel that all possibilities should be considered.
