LAST NIGHT THROUGH MY BINOULARS, I SPOTTED AN OBJECT NOT VISIBLE TO NAKED EYE. OBJECT TRAVELED AT GREAT SPEED. HAD HARD TIME KEEPING IN VIEW.

OBJECT PERMITTED ME TO BALL KEEP IN PERFECT TIME - BLEEP - BLEEP, DISAPPEAR - BATTO

OBJECT WAS ERRATIC IN MOVEMENTS. TRAVELED IN STRAIGHT LINE - THEN IN CIRCLE - UP AND DOWN - STOPPED IN GLOWING LIGHT. WATCHED FOR AREA WITH GREAT SPEED. DIDN'T LOCATE AGAIN.

SO FAST - DID NOT CHANGE COLORS REMAINED A BRILLIANT WHITE.

Robstown, Texas
September 14, 1968

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

Started not to send the enclosed back -- really completed the questionnaire for my own file. But!! here it is.

Several of us, here in Suburban Acres, have seen many UFO's but have been frustrated, so many times, in our honest desire to report sightings. I have talked to Chief Basham, of the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station, several times -- and you would have to go some to find a nicer person than he. But he is only on duty just so many hours of the day. The following is a conversation I had with someone in the Police Dept. (and this is one of the nicer ones)

ME: I wish to report a UFO
HE: Are you being molested?
ME: No, but--
HE: Well, lady, why call us?
ME: Well, like my wife says, "much they won't believe."

Not exactly brilliant but the point is this -- most people don't mind the little green men and the white strait jacket jokes if they have the feeling they are being taken seriously. Anyone with an ounce of common sense should realize this UFO business is not a laughing matter.

I don't drink, take dope, make up wild stories, or want publicity.
I am just plain interested and I detect having my intelligence questioned by a sarcastic newsman, a sadistic police officer or anyone else who has you. In fact, my husband wishes I had never heard of UFO's. We have an understanding -- he can go fishing anytime he desires and I watch for phenomena.

I have talked to many people that have sighted UFO's but decline reporting them for reasons stated above.

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]
