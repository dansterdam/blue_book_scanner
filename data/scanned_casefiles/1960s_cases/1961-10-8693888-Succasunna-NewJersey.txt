The image contains three sketches. The first sketch is a curved line showing how a high object would appear above the horizon (skyline) when first seen, and then how it would appear below the horizon (skyline) when last seen.

The second and third sketches depict the same landscape scene, with a person in the foreground. The second sketch shows the position of the object when it was first seen, marked as "A", and its position when last seen, marked as "B". The third sketch provides a more detailed view of the landscape.

Text output:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was below the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I could not determine exactly what the object was, but its appearance and flight characteristics led me to believe that it was some type of UFO that did not conform to any known conventional aircraft. The fact that it hovered and then accelerated at a tremendous speed leads me to believe that it was propelled by some means or technology that we do not currently possess.

Dear siri:
On the night of October 29, at approximately 9:30 P.M., a mysterious green light appeared in the west and hovered at terrific speed. Please don't think this is a favorite topic of mine.
Yours truly 
25. Dan sent the effect of the green light to the author to study, but didn't not really imply a moral, it went to facts.
