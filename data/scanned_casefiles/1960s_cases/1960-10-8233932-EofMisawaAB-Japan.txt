7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION                                 are very great. The result of the meteor
    1 1/2 sec                                            was probably quite close to being coin-

IT IS HIGHLY DOUBTFUL THAT SUCH A FLASH WOULD HAVE THE SHAPE AND SMOOTH OUTLINES AS REPORTED BY THE WITNESS. HOW WAS THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT DETERMINED? WHAT WAS THE ELEVATION AND AZIMUTH, IN DEGREES, OF THE OBJ WHEN FIRST AND LAST SEEN? WAS THERE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE OBJ NOTED? IF SO, HOW MUCH AND IN WHAT DIRECTION? ALSO AN ATTEMPT BE MADE TO DETERMINE IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES.
