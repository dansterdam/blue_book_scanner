10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Obj of sighting was located area. Changes in color of light could be sources on a/c as its position changed. Witnesses probably observed a/c anti-collision lights and afterburner on alternating occasions, specifically afterburner, after a/c was to the SE. Wind direction, altitude of a/c, other ground noises, and presence of other a/c could account for absence of noise in associated with obj. f/c could appear to be stationary if its flight path was along a radial which originated at location of observers. Absence of unidentified objts on radar in area tend to substantiate fact that no unknown objts were in area. Fading of bright light fm afterburner as it was turned off and/or as txmzx d/c changed position could be reason why witnesses felt obj was moving at a speed greater than an a/c. There is no info in report which would indicate that obj was not a/c. No evidence available indicating that objt was a threat to national security.

11. COMMENTS Probably 1 of a/c operating in local area. Witnesses probably definitely light sources on a/c anti-collision lights and afterburner.

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteors, Comet, Planet, etc.):

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.):

Aircraft: Balloons, Airships, etc.: Believe Aircraft

Other:

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probably Good

Analysis and Conclusions: It is Possible that the Object of this Sighting was one of the Aircraft Operating in the Local Area. The Chances of no Cause of the Event could be Due to the Witnesses Observing Different Light Sources on the Aircraft as its Position Changed. The Witnesses Readily Observed the Aircraft Anti-Collision Lights and the After Burner on Occasions. Specific Aircraft was to the Southeast. Other Aircraft was Directed, Altitude of the Aircraft, Other Ground Noises. And the Persons of Other Aircraft Could be Considered for Possible Noise in Association with the Object. The Aircraft Could Appear

OBSERVATION. POSSIBILITY OF OBJECT BEING A JET AIRCRAFT OR HELI
COPTER WAS DISCOUNTED DUE TO SPEED AND ALTITUDE. AS THE OBJECT
CAM ACROSS THE SKY ITS FLIGHT PATH WAS NOT CONSTANTLY STRAIGHT FOR
WARD BUT APPEARED IRREGULAR IN BOTH SPEED AND DIRESTIION. THE COLOR
OF THE OBJECT CHANGED FROM WHITE TO REDDISH COLOR. AT ONE POINT THE
OBJECT STOPBJ WAS VERY BRILLIANT IN COLOR AND AT GREAT ALTITUDE.
AFTER STAYING BASICALLY STATIONARY AND CONSTANT IN COLOR (WHITE) FOR
APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 3 MINUTES, THE OBJECT BEGAN TO RAISE IN 90 DEGREE
VERTICAL FLIGHT NOW CHANGING COLOR. AS THE OBJECT WAS RISING A JET
FIGHTER CAME OVER THE AREA APPROACHING THE BASE AT APPROXIMATELY
5000 FEET OR LESS. THE OBJECT THEN BEGAN FORWARD MOVEMENT AND THEN
CHANGED DIRECTION 90 DEGREES, THEN CONTINUED ITS ORIGINAL DIRECTION
TO THE EAST SOUTH EAST. IT'S LIGHT AT THIS PO NT WAS BRILLIANT BUT
HAD BECOME SMALL AS THE STARS. THE SPEED AT THIS POINT WAS DEFINITE

JECT BUT CONSIDERED IT QUITE LIKELY THAT THE SIGHTING COULD HAVE
BEEN CAUSED BY AN F-102 DOING EXTENSIVE FLYING AND MANEUVERS IN THE
LOCAL AREA WITH AFTER-BURNER. THERE WERE NO MISSILE FIRINGS OR
AERIAL TESTS IN THE AREA. A STRONG POSSIBILITY EXIST THAT A DIS-
CREPANCY BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING OR THE RELEASE TIME OF
THE WEATHER BALLOON COULD HAVE OCCURRED, AND THIS WAS THE OBJECT
BEING OBSERVED. NO EXPLANATION EXISTS FOR THE REPORTED HIGH SPEED
OF THE OBJECT, EXCEPT ERROR ON THE PART OF THE OBSERVERS. 2. ON

HOVERED FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN BEGAN TO MOVE IN A WIDE GRADUAL TURN
