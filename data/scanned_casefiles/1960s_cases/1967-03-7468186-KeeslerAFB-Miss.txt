Unfortunately, there is no photograph or image present in this page of the old UFO report document. The document appears to be a text-based Air Force message with details related to a UFO report, including information about an "ELONGATED FIREBALL", an "ENGINE AIRLINER", and an "ORANGE-YELLOWISH FLAME". I have extracted all the text from the document and provided it below:

Consistent with the instructions, here is the text output from the document:

"Info for the Record: 3 April 67
Contact with READATS did not reveal a satellite decay that could account for the sighting. There was no record of any space debris re-entering the earth's atmosphere at the time of the sighting."
