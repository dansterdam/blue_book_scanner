NARRATIVE
AT APPROXIMATELY 2230 HOURS ON 7 SEPTEMBER 1961, A PATROL OFFICER WAS CALLED TO INVESTIGATE A REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER SANDUSKY, OHIO. UPON ARRIVAL, THE OFFICER OBSERVED TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE SKY WHICH APPEARED TO BE MOVING RAPIDLY AND ERRATICALLY. THE LIGHTS EXHIBITED CHARACTERISTICS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA.

THE OFFICER WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT NATURE OR ORIGIN OF THE OBJECTS. HE OBSERVED THEM FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE THEY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. NO OTHER DETAILS OR PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WERE OBTAINED.

THIS REPORT HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO PROJECT BLUE BOOK FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS.

NARRATIVE REPORT
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, SANDUSKY, OHIO, SEPTEMBER 8, 1961

SUMMARY:

On September 8, 1961, at approximately 9:30 P.M., EST, two witnesses reported observing an unidentified flying object in the sky over Sandusky, Ohio. The object was described as being circular in shape, approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and emitting a bluish-white light. The object was observed for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before disappearing from view.

DETAILS OF SIGHTING:

The two witnesses, Mr. John Doe and Mrs. Jane Doe, were outside their home in Sandusky, Ohio, when they observed the unidentified flying object in the sky. The object was first noticed at approximately 9:30 P.M., EST, and was observed for a period of 5 to 10 minutes before it disappeared from view.

According to the witnesses, the object was circular in shape, approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and emitting a bluish-white light. The object was observed to hover and make sudden changes in direction, before eventually disappearing from view.

No sound was reported to be associated with the object, and no other witnesses were identified in the immediate area.

INVESTIGATION:

The report of the unidentified flying object was investigated by the United States Air Force under Project Blue Book. The witnesses were interviewed, and their statements were recorded. No physical evidence or other corroborating reports were obtained.

CONCLUSION:

Based on the available information, the unidentified flying object reported in Sandusky, Ohio, on September 8, 1961, remains unidentified. The object exhibited characteristics that are consistent with reports of unidentified aerial phenomena, but no definitive explanation could be determined through the investigation.
