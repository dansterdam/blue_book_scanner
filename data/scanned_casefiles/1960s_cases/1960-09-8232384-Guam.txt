MILITARY RADAR PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 29 Sep 60
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 29/12552
5. PHOTOS: one
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Few sec
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Target picked up on radar at 20 miles, tracked to within 2 miles of NAS on collision course. Estimated speed 2800 knots. Visual observation of pale blue light (with binoculars) contact lost when observer turned away for a second.
12. CONCLUSIONS: Was Balloon, Was Aircraft, Possibly Aircraft, Was Astronomical, Possibly Astronomical, Insufficient Data for Evaluation, Unknown.
11. COMMENTS: Anomalous propagation frequently causes false targets on radar, escapes travelling at apparently fantastic speeds, and it appears that this might well be the answer here.

Memo, AFOTN-2EXZ, 11 Oct 60, Request for Analysis
1st Ind (AFOTN-2EXZ/Ws. Bryant/20/1950)
3rd Ind AFOTN-2EXZ
1. The facts as presented in this report are insufficient to support a firm conclusion about the "incident" reported from a range of 20 miles to a range of 2 miles at a speed of 2800 knots indicates that the target was observed for about 1/3 minute. This is rather short time to observe the target on radar and correlate a visual observation.
2. The speed of a large aircraft is normally less than the speed indicated, and the great altitude of such observations and the fact that the target was not on collision course with an aircraft target. On the other hand, anomalous propagation frequently causes false targets on radar scope traveling at apparently fantastic speeds, and it appears that this might well be the answer here.
