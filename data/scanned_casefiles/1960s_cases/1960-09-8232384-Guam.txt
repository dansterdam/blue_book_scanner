9. COURSE
    SW-NW

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    Target picked up on radar at 20 miles, tracked to within 2 miles of NAS on collision course.
    Estimated speed 2880 knots. Visual observation (with binoculars) contact lost when observer turned away for a second.

11. COMMENTS
    Anomalous propagation frequently causes false targets on radar scopes traveling at apparently fantastic speeds, and it appears that this might well be the answer here. U.S.A.F. Condon Review.

Memo, AFCIN-482x, 11 Oct 60, Request for Analysis

1st Ind (AFCIN-421a/Mr. Bryant/jc/74201)                     14 Nov 60

TO:   AFCIN-482X

1. The facts as presented in this report are insufficient to support a firm analysis. The fact that the "target" moved from a range of 20 miles to a range of 2 miles at a speed of 2660 knots indicates that the target was observed for about 1/3 minute. This is a rather short time to observe the target on radar and correlate a visual observation.

2. The speed of the target, the fact that no plane was known to be in the area, lack of aural observation, and the fact that the target was not observed on an outward course all tend to mitigate against an aircraft target. On the other hand, anomalous propagation frequently causes false targets on radar scopes traveling at apparently fantastic speeds, and it appears that this might well be the answer here.
