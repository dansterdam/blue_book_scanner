Evaluation of Source Reliability: Very Reliable
Analysis and Conclusions: The description and claims of the object fit the characteristics of a satellite, possibly the AGENA-D, in its orbital flight path. The witness was able to observe it for an extended period of time, noting its movement and disappearance over the horizon. Other astronomical phenomena were ruled out. The reliability of the source is deemed very reliable.
