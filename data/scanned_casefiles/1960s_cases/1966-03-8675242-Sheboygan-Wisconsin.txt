Gentlemen:

On the night of March 24 (very clear, but dark night) at 10:15 p.m. my sister and I were on our way home when we spotted unusual thin lights which were almost centered over the road. About four. Our curiosity aroused, we continued onto the night block instead of making our night there when we ordinarily would have to get home.

We continued along for about a half block, watching whatever it was, at which point we found ourselves directly beneath the light. We then came to a stop and discovered that the object had also stopped moving. The object

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    22    MAY    1966
    Day         Month     Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

When we first sighted the object, it was about 1/2 block ahead of us. At this point it appeared to be two-white, bright lights. When we were beneath it, the span between the two lights seemed to be a large airplane. The lights did not flicker or flash at this time, after going at the object we could make out hazy form of the lights, or possibly was the outline of it.

We were the only moving vehicle on the street at the time when it appeared again. It seemed it may have encircled around to pass once near again. We could see numerous lights, mostly white, some red and green. Many of these lights were flashing in a most indefinite way. The object at this time was approximately the same height as shown on diagram page 5, at 15-16 on curved line.

appeared in arrangement. There were two bright, white lights, the span between which seemed to be like that of a large airplane. Close each white light were glowing flames - one red in color, the other green which, by the silhouette, seemed to be contained within a small shape area. I was not driving, as I concentrated on adjusting my eyes to try to distinguish any features. The object seemed to be just high enough to clear the tree tops and houses; yet all I could make out was an vague outline of the form or these stars - whatever it was that formed a pillar V shape.

[There is also a hand-drawn diagram showing white lights and green/red lights in a V-shaped configuration]

There was also a smaller dimmer light visible at the bottom or possibly at one more to the rear.

A weird feeling came over us, especially since we were the only people on the street and in the only moving vehicle on the street at the time. We had the feeling it might descend and became a little afraid. Then we drove to the next corner, turned right, and continued for about a half block, there we parked as we to watch from a safe distance, but now it seemed to have disappeared. While we were wondering about the disappearance, we were completely surprised when the large object came from behind us and passed over us approximately 50 ft. above ground level. Now it seemed that it might have circled around to pass over us again. We could see numerous lights, mostly white that

some red and green. Many of these lights were flashing in an indefinite pattern. We heard no sound at all coming from it at any time, and we watched for approximately one minute as it flew very low across our city from south to north and disappeared from view.

We then went home and reported the sighting to our local police. We know of at least one other person who reported a sighting on the same night.

Though this letter is respectfully delayed, we hope it

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The first thing that caught our attention was a "pair" of bright, white lights.

When we got beneath the object we could see that the span between the lights was approximately twice the span of the wings of a large airplane. At this time all the lights as depicted in drawing on page 3, no. 19, were not flashing but were steady. We are not sure whether the shallow shape we could make out was two bars or an outline of the object.

We were the only people on the street at this time.

The object did not disappear while we were watching it, but after we moved to a different location we could not see it where it had been before and thought it did disappear. We were amazed when it re-appeared from behind us, (from opposite direction in our sighting) flew right over us just above the treetops, flew very low across the city and disappeared from view.

At the time of this second sighting there were more lights, mostly white, some red and green. This time the lights were flashing in an irregular pattern.
