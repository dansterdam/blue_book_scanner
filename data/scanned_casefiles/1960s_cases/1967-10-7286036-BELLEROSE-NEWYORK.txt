Here is the transcribed text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It was like the object just disappeared and then reappeared again a little farther away. It seemed to move just like a light bulb going out and then coming back on again.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: It seemed to move behind a cloud and then reappear.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Silent
b. Color: At first it was a bright light and then it seemed to change to a dim red or orange color.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
No to of the full size.
It was with the loss.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[The image contains a simple hand-drawn sketch of the UFO sighting, with an arrow indicating the direction of movement.]

The image contains a diagram with a compass rose and a sketch showing the elevation of an object above the horizon. There is no photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

902 75°
90°        30° 
                   

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

                         (Cloud? I could not see?)

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Performing OCR on the text in the image:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  7   October 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
It appeared to be following a jet plane at an altitude probably about 35,000 feet. It was dim and barely visible at times. It was much higher than the jet plane and seemed to be moving faster than the jet. The most remarkable thing about it was its apparent ability to maneuver. It appeared to be able to move up, down, and from side to side with great speed and agility, a motion unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. I had also seen a similar object on a previous occasion at a lower altitude, but was unable to get a photo of it more representative.
I realize that this is still rather sketchy consideration, but I trust it may be of some use to your study. I am all most sincere in the observations I have reported.
Thank you for your consideration of this matter.
Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

Exhibit to question over (name) observation, made on or about 3:25 p.m., Oct. 5, 1967 at Bellerose, New York by (name). I was standing outside my home located at (address) observing the weather, as it had been very windy for the past few days. At that time, I observed an object in the sky which appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed, much faster than any jet aircraft that I have seen. The object was shaped like a disc or saucer and was silver or metallic in color. After watching it for about 3 to 4 seconds, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. I have had the opportunity to observe many aircraft and the like in the sky, but I have never seen anything like this object before. I shall report it as an unidentified flying object.

1. Reference your undated letter regarding the evaluation on your unidentified aerial observation of October 22, 1967.
2. You may be interested in the enclosed information on aerial advertising. The maga zine "Sandy Claaorna," April 9, 1967 issue, and the letter from Luverne, Illinois, illustrate how electrical advertising can be mistinterpreted as unidentified flying objects. I hope this additional information will answer any questions you had on your observation.

SUBJECT: UFO observation -- October 22, 1967
TO: TDPT (UFO)

1) This is in reference to your letter dated March 18, 1968 concerning my sighting of 9/22/67.
2) If the sighting was an electrical advertising sign,
a. Wouldn't the sign say something? (something in the order of whatever it was advertising for) . . . not just a definite pattern of flashing lights.
b. Where was the aircraft that was moving the electrical advertising sign at the beginning of the sighting?
c. Was this the electrical advertising sign approx. 1/2 mile behind stated aircraft? (wouldn't that make for hazardous air travel!?)
3) I am not trying to disprove your explanation but only illuminate mine . . . because I am not satisfactorily convinced of the one you submitted.

Thank you very much

GENTLEMEN:

On the evening of October 22, 1967 (Sunday), at approximately 8:00 p.m., I, Yvonne, my sister and mother, and a family friend were looking out of my window. It was looking out of my window that evening that I saw an object with flashing lights. It came from the east and moved across the sky very fast. There was no sound and it moved sideways all the while the lights were visible and flashing. I then called my sister who also saw the object. The UFO moved light again, and it moved in a erraetic manner, not in a straight line. Due to the lateness of the hour, the shape of the UFO was indeterminable. It was quite close to the earth and was silhouetted to the size of a small car in width.

I will try to re-enact the sighting and position.

Expeditional aircraft - however, we will not accept MARSH GAS as an answer of possible solution.
