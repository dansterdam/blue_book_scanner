10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A square light in a round circle, moving SW in a straight line, flashing red, green and white light. The altitude of the object was estimated to be 37 1/2 miles using an inlometer. Reported stationary for 20 min, then moved SW for 15°.

11. COMMENTS
The sighting gives all indication of being due to atmospheric refraction.

- Stellar scintillation, possibly. This caused by turbulence, not inversion.

Inversion cannot be resp. for 15° lateral motion.

If motion was real, cause is not inversion.

☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☒ Other/Temp Inversion
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown

6. The sighting when occurred in Colorado on 29 September 1960 gives all indication of being due to atmospheric refraction. AFIC has taken action to obtain the weather data for the area on the date of the sighting. A complete analysis will be accomplished when AFIC receives this additional data.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:

At approximately 1040,10 October 1960, a telephone call was made to the home of Mr [redacted] of Grand Junction, Colorado regarding the sighting made by him, and others, on 28 Sep 1960, and the following additional information was acquired.

The object was first seen and reported from Farmington, New Mexico on a bearing of 35 degrees. It was also reported to be seen from Eagle, Colorado on a bearing of approximately 225 degrees. Mr [redacted] saw the object on a bearing of 100 degrees. Mr [redacted] then made a triangulation and said the object was estimated to be over Gunnison, Colorado. He also stated that a B-52 was refueling in the Deadwood refueling area, and when the acft was contacted regarding the object a reply was made to the effect that the object could be see. After the refueling operation was completed the acft changed course and flew in the direction of the object. Mr [redacted] stated that the pilot later reported to the Denver control that when they were in the area of the alleged object, nothing could be seen.

The object was described as round, flashing red, green white light with a small square in the middle. The altitude of the object was estimated to be 37½ miles using an inclinometer. The object was reported to be stationary for 20 minutes, then it moved Southwest for 15 degrees. The object was visible for 40 minutes.

UFO Sightings, Grand Junction, Colorado (29 Sep 1960)                16 NOV 1960

CAFOI-3d (L/Col Tucker)

1. On 29 September 1960 at 0521Z (2221 hours on 29 September 1960) unidentified flying objects were sighted from FAA stations at Grand Junction and Eagle, Colorado and also from the station at Farmington, New Mexico. In addition, many people in the general area reported seeing unidentified flying objects.

2. The object viewed from Grand Junction was described as a round, flashing red, green and white light and reported as generally stationary. The object was in sight for 10 minutes.

3. The witnesses at Grand Junction and Farmington used a theodolite to measure the angle of elevation of the object and then by triangulation arrived at an altitude of 37½ miles for the object.

4. ATIC obtained weather data for the date of the sighting from Air Weather Service, Asheville, North Carolina. The adiabatic charts for the area show an inversion at 0405 on the date of the sighting. The ATIC conclusion is that effects produced by this inversion were responsible for the UFO sightings in this area.

5. The stations which measured the angle of elevation of the object were consistent with 15°; however, triangulation revealed that the object, if it were the same one, would have been further from one station than the other, thus a geometric inconsistency. If the objects viewed were due to the inversion, then the apparent angles would have been approximately the same from any location.

6. In the instances of inversions (temperatures low near the ground and increasing rapidly as altitude increases), light rays which pass through this layer are bent toward the earth and effectively the distance to the horizon is increased from any given point. Mirages which result from these conditions are sometimes referred to as "looming mirages" because unstable conditions may cause a distant object to suddenly "loom" above the horizon.

7. From the limited information available, it is impossible for ATIC to determine what specific object was viewed by each witness;

however, it is concluded that the inversion was responsible for
common objects being misidentified and mistakes made as to their
actual location.
