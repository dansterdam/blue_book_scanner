Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter of August 3, 1964, addressed to NASA, concerning a satellite you have recently observed on several successive mornings.

ECHO I was in passage over the Miami area on July 25th at 8:20 p.m., EST; July 26th, 9:11 p.m., EST; July 30th at 7:52 p.m., EST and again at 8:10 p.m.; July 31st at 7:24 p.m., EST and again at 9:32 p.m., EST; and on August 2nd at 8:15 p.m., EST.

Dear Sir:

From the past few years, I have seen a satellite, I first saw the night to be a satellite, per over my home. It moved from south to north between the hours of night and day at night. I have seen kind of a certain sound and his same spot, visible nights in a near detail, now please tell me if this is a satellite?

Yours truly,
