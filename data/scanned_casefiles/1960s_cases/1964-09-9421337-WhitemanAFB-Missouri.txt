REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
DATE OF REPORT: September 9, 1964 
LOCATION: Whiteman AFB, Missouri
SUMMARY: At 2040 hours on 8 September 1964, the Whiteman AFB Security Control Center received a call from the Command Post at Whiteman AFB stating that the Base Security Patrol had observed an unidentified flying object in the area of Knob Noster, Missouri. The Security Patrol was dispatched to investigate.
The Security Patrol reported that they observed a bright light in the sky which was stationary for approximately 15 minutes, then the light started moving in a northwesterly direction and disappeared from view. The light was described as being larger than a star and brighter than any star in the vicinity. No other details were reported.

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, MISSOURI
9 SEPTEMBER 1964

On 9 September 1964, at approximately 2100 hours, the control tower at Whiteman AFB, Missouri, observed a bright orange or reddish object in the sky, approximately 20,000 feet in altitude. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes. It appeared stationary at first, then began moving in a northerly direction. The object appeared to be metallic in construction and was oval in shape. No other details about the object could be ascertained.

Incident was reported to the 351st Strategic Missile Wing Command Post, and subsequently to the Air Force Headquarters, Offutt AFB, Nebraska.

CASE FILE
DATE: 9 September 1964
LOCATION: Whiteman AFB, Missouri
TIME: Unknown
SOURCE: (a) Telephone call, (b) Copy of MEMO
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

SUMMARY: On 9 September 1964 a report was received via telephone from the Minot AFB, N. D. Command Post that an unidentified flying object had been sighted near Whiteman AFB, Missouri, at an unknown time on 9 September 1964.

On 11 September 1964, a copy of an Air Force Memorandum to the Chief of Staff, United States Air Force, was received by the Director of Project Blue Book, giving details of the incident.

According to the memorandum, the UFO was described as a shiny, metallic disc-shaped object hovering approximately 150 feet above the ground, that took off at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object was observed by both military and civilian personnel. No further details are available.

CONCLUSIONS: None

This document appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report regarding an unidentified flying object sighting near Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on September 9, 1964. The report summarizes the details provided in a telephone call and a subsequent Air Force memorandum, describing the observed object as a shiny, metallic disc-shaped UFO that hovered and then quickly departed the area. No further conclusions are provided in this particular report page.
