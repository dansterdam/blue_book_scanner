INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object changing course moving with wind. Observed as a bright light to South of several missile sites. In sight for over one hour. Kept changing course. Report as low (200 ft). Efforts by mobile team to close on object failed. Chase turned over to civil authorities. Object described as a blue light size and had witness of club headlight. At one point seemed to appear to explode in mid air. Kept moving and reported to be 10 to 20 ft off ground at one or two sites.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
One Hour

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

7. COURSE
Erratic

8. PHOTOS
[ ] Yes
[X] No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
[ ] Yes
[X] No

COMMENTS: Object apparently moving with wind. Definite track of object not included with the report. Sighting indicates a possible balloon at low altitude with light attached. No report from the civil authorities who continued chase of object and no flight path of object included with the report.

WHITEMAN AFB, 7 Sep 64

On 8 Sep 64 Hq USAF SAFOI PB (Heles) called regarding a sighting at Whiteman AFB on 7 Sep 64. UPI had asked them for information on sighting. Helen gave this information: Blue object 500 ft in air, speed 5 knots, crashed more 20 ft in field, rose about 5 ft took off at 1 knots. This was reported by Highway Patrol. Air Force Security People on station at Whiteman had done reporting to Hq SAFOI.

On 8 Sep 64 call made to Whiteman AFB, Base Security Office, area code 816 Logan 3 5511. Spoke with Airman Farley, told him we were checking up on a UFO report. We have reports from Webb which we want to find out about. Call transferred to Wing (357). Spoke with Sgt Lemington. Last night at 2106 hours about 20 and 25 miles. Appeared about 200 ft in air. Similar reports. Directly South of original sighting. Col Baker said no action unless object intends penetration. Sgt Lemington said he would find out more information and give us a call right back after Maj Q informed him that the Secretary of the Air Force needed this information in a hurry as someone had reported it to the UPI and associated press also had info on it.

10 Sep 64 placed a call to Whiteman AFB, spoke with Command post. Sighting at 03362, 8 Sep 64, India reported sighting UFO, small blue light size of auto headlights. Also 5 other sighted south of Whiteman Moved as bank towards Clington, Missouri about 20 ft off ground. Mobile Strike team sent out. Looked like 15 was moving over another site. Strike highway patrol notified. Always in South. Strikeam called back in. Seemed to be moving with wind. Wind to South. Command post ext 3955.

This appears to be a detailed data log or record sheet with multiple columns of numerical data. The document seems to be from a military or scientific record, specifically from Whiteman AFB in Missouri, as indicated by the filename. The page contains numerous rows and columns of numbers, with headers and labels on the left and right sides of the document. The data appears to be related to measurements, times, altitudes, or other technical specifications. The document looks like a standard form used for recording systematic observations or measurements.

The left margin contains some vertical text that appears to read "BLUSH" or something similar, though it is partially cut off.

The bottom of the page contains summary rows and additional data columns, including sections for "Coded Data for Transmission" and "Maximum Wind Speed Data".

data reach 50-60,000 feet. This station submits data monthly and the
September 1964 records are not yet available. However, Colombia,
Missouri is a rawinsonde station which forwards records weekly and we
have included copies of the 6-8 Sep 64 for Colombia as a substitute.

WINDS-ALOFT COMPUTATION SHEET
(LANDSTATION FORM)
(FORM-2)

Year    1964    Month    SEP    Day    5    Time    71

The rest of the document appears to be a detailed meteorological data table with columns for:
- Elevation angle
- Distance from observation
- Azimuth angle
- Wind direction and speed
- Compass heading
- Pressure
- Altitude
- Elapsed time

Most of the specific numerical data in the table is partially illegible due to the image quality, but the structure of the form is clear. The document is from Whiteman AFB in Missouri, dated September 5, 1964.

The document appears to be a detailed data table with multiple columns and rows, containing numerical data and various measurements. On the left side, there is a vertical text section that seems to be partially cut off. The table includes sections for "Punched Card Data" and "Maximum Wind Speed Data" at the bottom right. The document looks like a technical or scientific data recording sheet, possibly from a meteorological or scientific observation. Some text is difficult to read due to the image quality, but the table is filled with numbers and measurements across multiple rows and columns.
