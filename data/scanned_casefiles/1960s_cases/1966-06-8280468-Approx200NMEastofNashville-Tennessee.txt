One object was the star Regulus, other was a possible reflection of moon which appeared to them to speed off in a second or two.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers sighted two star-like objects relative close together, lower and west of the moon, approx 1:30-2:00 O'Clock position from nose of a/c (a/c = aircraft) 115째 (Measured Heading). Objects headed southwest toward horizon, at the 12:00 O'Clock position. The objects stopped twice. Once at 29 deg, second at 21 deg, then made last movements and grew dimmer and disappeared. A/C was flying at 41,900 ft, at 460 knots. One object was the star Regulus. Second object possible reflection of the moon on the windshield of a/c.
