DIVISION KEESLER AFB. (COMMENTS) THE POSSIBILITY OF TWO-BOATS OPERATING IN THE INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY CREATING DIFFUSED AND DISTORTED PATTERNS ON THE CLOUD FORMATION WOULD BE VERY GREAT. WITH A SOPHISTICATED RADAR OPERATING IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY, MOST OBJECTS AIRBORNE WOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THERE WERE NO CONTACTS MADE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTINGS BY THE HOUMA RADAR STATION, OR THE MONTGOMERY AIR DEFENSE SECTOR. HOWEVER DERELICT BALLOONS HAVE BEEN SIGHTED IN THIS AREA IN THE PAST.
