FOREWORD

For twenty years reports of flying saucers and other unidentified flying objects (UFO's) have come regularly from all parts of the world. Thousands of persons have seen them, including pilots, airport officials, policemen, and others trained to identify conventional aircraft. And scores of persons have even taken photographs of UFO's. Many of these sightings remain unexplained despite intensive investigation by military authorities and scientists.

To better acquaint the public with the scope of flying saucer sightings over the past two decades, the editors of LOOK called upon the world-wide news gathering services of United Press International to collect authentic photographs of UFO's and detailed information from persons who have seen them. This unique LOOK special, Flying Saucers, is the result.

Special acknowledgments are made to Jack V. Fox of UPI, who prepared the text; Harold Blumenfeld of UPI Newspictures, who gathered the pictures; and Tom Mindell of the LOOK Book Division, who designed the book.
