10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Witness first obj appeared like a large luminous obj in same area all during observation, and witnesses went out about an hours later to see if it could be seen, and it was still there. Characterized as a astronomical body, such as a star or planet.

11. COMMENTS:
Obj except that it changed colors. Obj very bright star radius was to W of witnesses location at about 10° elev. However, being so close to horizon it would appear to be higher than it actually was. There were other bright stars in the sky, however, they were not as bright as Sirius. It is therefore concluded that obj sighted was probably star Sirius.

THE OBJECT WAS A BLUE EGG SHAPED TARGET MOVING FAIRLY FAST (PROBABLY AT THE SPEED A JET FIGHTER OR A LITTLE FASTER). THE UFO TRAVELED FROM NORTH TO SOUTH MAINTAINING A CONSTANT 10° ABOVE THE HORIZON. EVEN WITH BINOCULARS NO PROTRUSIONS COULD BE SEEN. HOWEVER THE CITY UFO WAS CLEARLY DEFINED & THE EDGE WERE NOT AT ALL BLURRED) FROM THE SIGHTING WAS MADE A TAPE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Bluish-white lights proceeding at same rate of speed in NW-SE. Disappeared in hazy sky. Observed at about 70° elev.

11. COMMENTS
Probability of these objts being insects was ruled out due to sighting taking place in late Oct. Description of appearance of objts is not unlike that for flying jet a/c. Altitude, distance, wind direction and fact that car windows were probably uncoated argue for absence of noise. Fact that sighting occurred in vicinity of Wright-Patterson AFB, a relatively dense air traffic area, tends to substantiate this conclusion.

The analyst called me for more information. The movie screen facts (west) the objects were both sighted simultaneously to mostly passed over tip of screen diagonally to the left side of the screen. The witnesses were parked in the 4th row from the screen.

(4 screen faces west, objects moved north, if it faces east, objects moved north) (see item 17 for correct info)

Although both objects were seen at the same time, they weren't close together.
