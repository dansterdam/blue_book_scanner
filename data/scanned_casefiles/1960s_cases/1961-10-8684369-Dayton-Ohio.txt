10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The radar equipment showed an object that appeared like a large stationary observation, a little brighter than 5 stars would be, and it was still there when the observation was terminated. The object could not be seen visually, but it was still there when the observation was terminated. There were other bright stars in the sky, however, they were not as bright as the object detected on radar.

3. DATE/TIME GROUP 9-5-61/2320Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION Ground-Radar, Air-Visual
5. SOURCE 12 OBSERVER MILITARY PERSONNEL
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS 1
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION 2-3 MIN.
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Object appeared as a bright light, speed approx. 1100-1300 mph, climbed straight up very rapidly, disappeared in haze. Ground radar tracked the object for 2-3 min, but it disappeared from radar.
9. COURSE Straight up
10. CONCLUSIONS: Probably Satellite, Possibly Aircraft, Possibly Astronomical
11. COMMENTS: Probability is that these objects being observed in the Dayton, Ohio area in late Oct. Description of objects is not positive that they were aircraft. They appeared to be high flying jets or satellites, based on high speed and high climbing speed. However, ground radar did track them and they disappeared on radar. Without more definite information it is difficult to make a conclusive determination of what these objects were. For these reasons, this case is carried as UNKNOWN.
