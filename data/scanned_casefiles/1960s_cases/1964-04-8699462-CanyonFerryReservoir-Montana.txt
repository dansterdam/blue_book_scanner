Tioga Agog Over Space Visit Report
R. REID A. OCHS
Newark Valley, Broome Co., N.Y.
The writer has brought inquiries by an official agency, and has been a spondent in this case now since it first came to my attention over a year ago.
On two occasions, Mrs. Mary Ferrell of Tioga County, Pa. and a woman companion, whom she introduced as Mrs. Gary Barker, also of Tioga County, called on me to relate their story of a rather unusual experience. 
The incidents has brought inquiries by an official agency, and it has been deemed advisable to submit this report of the salient features of the case, while withholding the names of the principals involved, as well as certain other details which might serve to identify them.
The facts are these: On a certain Saturday evening, about a year ago, Mrs. Ferrell and her companion were driving home from a visit to relatives, when near the small hamlet of Tioga Center, Pa., they observed a peculiar light in the sky. Stopping their car, they noticed that the light seemed to be approaching them, and presently a large, disc-shaped object came to rest on the road some 50 yards ahead of them.
The object was described as being about 40 feet in diameter, with a dome-like structure on top, and a row of multi-colored lights around its periphery. A bright beam of light was directed down from the center of the underside of the object.
The two women, somewhat shaken by this unexpected occurrence, remained in the car, watching the object for several minutes. Suddenly, the beam of light was turned off, and the object took to the air with a slight rocking motion, and disappeared from view in a northerly direction.
Recovering from their initial amazement, the two women decided to report their experience to the local authorities. Through channels, the report eventually reached certain official agencies in Washington, resulting in the inquiry mentioned above.
In a subsequent interview, the two women provided additional details. They stated that, as the object hovered over the road, a 'door' opened in the side, and two human-like figures emerged and approached their automobile. The figures were described as being about 5 feet tall, with a greenish-grey complexion, large eyes and small mouth and nose, and appeared to be wearing tight-fitting, one-piece garments.
One of the figures, apparently the spokesman, addressed the two women, informing them that they were from another planet, and had come to Earth to make contact with human beings. He stated that the inhabitants of their planet were highly advanced, both technologically and spiritually, and were intensely interested in the people of Earth and their way of life.
The figure went on to say that they had been observing the Tioga area for some time, and had determined that the two women were of a suitable mental and spiritual calibre to be entrusted with a message for the people of Earth. He then proceeded to outline, in rather generalized terms, the nature of this message.
Apparently, the inhabitants of the visiting planet were deeply concerned over the warlike tendencies and environmental destruction prevalent on Earth, and wished to impart a warning and a plea for humanity to change its ways before it was too late. They expressed the hope that the two women would convey this message to the proper authorities, so that steps could be taken to avert a potential catastrophe.
After a brief exchange of questions and answers, the figures re-entered the craft, the beam of light was turned on, and the object rose rapidly and disappeared from view.
The two women, somewhat shaken by their encounter, returned home and immediately contacted the local authorities. Understandably, their story was met with a certain degree of skepticism, and it was not until several weeks later that the official inquiry mentioned earlier was instituted.
Throughout the investigation, the two women have remained consistent in their account of the incident, and have demonstrated a high degree of sincerity and conviction. There is no evidence to suggest that they are in any way attempting to perpetrate a hoax.
It is the considered opinion of the writer that the two women did, in fact, have a genuine UFO encounter of the type described. While certain aspects of their story may be open to question or interpretation, the basic facts, as related, appear to be substantially correct.
The message conveyed by the alleged space visitors, if authentic, is certainly one that merits serious consideration by the people of Earth. Whether or not it will have any significant impact remains to be seen. In any event, the incident serves to illustrate the continuing interest of some 'outside' intelligence in the affairs of our planet.

Phone Co.
Base-Rate
Change OK'd

Nearby - the New York Tel. Co. has applied to the Public Service Commission for a change in rates - they want to increase the monthy phone service charge in the Metropolitan area by 20c. i'nd in the suburb. areas by 10c. They say the. cause of this is the tremendous increase in the number of phones in use and the constantly increasing costs of operation and maintenance.

Some of the figures given are:
1949 - 3,560,000 phones
1959 - 6,000,000 phones
And altho the number has gone up 66 2/3%, the rates have not been changed for 10 years.

When they get thru, our phone bill will be a little more. But we should, perhaps, consider ourselves lucky. In England the charges for phone service are much higher than here.

Does this sound like the old story of higher costs and so higher prices? Most things go up or change OK these days. The public usually has to pay the bill.

Talks With "Martians" Over 2 1/2 Hours - Newark Valley Man Says
Whether or not there is any-thing to flying saucer stories, a new one has popped up that week and because its locale is in Newark Valley, the story is inter-esting. A Newark Valley farmer, Gary T. Wilson, says he was working in his field when he had a visitor.
On April 24, Gary T. Wilson, a Newark Valley farmer, says he was working in his field, when something "looking like a small spaceman" came from the ground near his tractor. Because there was a large refrigerator near the tractor, the reflection came from Gary thought nothing of it. But then the thing started moving around him. So up and close to, he saw that the glint came from an object about 18 by 15 feet long, 15 feet wide by four feet high. The thing seemed to be resting on a tripod type of device that was on the ground and near-by stood two human shaped forms about 4 feet high without necks and their extremities seemed to be enclosed in similar forms to that of the "ship they had seemingly arrived in," according to Mr. Wilson.
He reported to the Democrat reporter that the two held boxes of red and when he approached they turned to be gas tanks holding something believed to be the fuel.
When asked how he, Wilson, reacted, he said: "Without growing, they picked up a bag of fertilizer from the barn and carried it to the top of the small where the ship had been. The next morning the bag was gone."
When asked whether his views on the possibility of beings on other planets had changed since his strange meeting, Mr. Will said he had always believed in beings on Mars but I do know that I talked to two small men in a strange ship.

Egyptians Give Khrushchev Noisy African Welcome
By GEORGE MCARTHUR
CAIRO (AP)--Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, making his first visit to Africa, received a tumultuous welcome from Egyptians today. He was acclaimed at the seaport of Alexandria, on a train ride through the Nile Delta and in a red-festooned Cairo.
Not since the revolutionary days of 1952 have so many people surged to the streets of Egypt's capital. It was estimated a half million lined the streets in the heart of the city.
President Gamal Abdel Nasser embraced him warmly as he began his 17-day state visit to the United Arab Republic.
A surging crowd broke through police lines as he drove in an open car to the railway station.
Similar crowds jammed around the Cairo railway station as Khrushchev arrived on a booming 21-gun salute after his train made a 10-minute stop in the ancient harbor of Alexandria.
Since early morning there were unnumbered thousands in the towns of Sohag, Benisuef and Tanta, where his train made brief stops. The ancient harbor of Alexandria was a bedlam of noise with whistling as the Soviet liner Armenia carrying Khrushchev and some 100 aides roared overhead and Soviet-built destroyers and submarines of the Egyptian navy escorted the Armenia into port.
A 21-gun salute boomed and thousands of seamen and dockers lining the piers shouted as Khrushchev walked down the gangway.
Flags, bunting and victory arches decorated the city as Nasser gave his guest a reception for outstaying the one for Red China's Premier Chou En-lai last December.
A barge with top Egyptian officials on board accompanied the Armenia as it docked in the harbor. Khrushchev was welcomed by Nasser on the shore. Khrushchev was accompanied by his wife, Nina, and their son, Sergei, and daughter-in-law.
The official purpose of the visit is to enable Khrushchev to take part in ceremonies marking the completion of the first stage of the Aswan High Dam.
Khrushchev is expected to make a major propaganda and diplomatic impact for the Soviet brand of communism in Africa, seeking to neutralize the influence of Red China, which made gains in Africa, especially to the detriment of the fair market value of Davis' estate.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT 5/1/64

Tiny Martians Visit Newark Valley?
By BILL SMITH

"One can't believe it, but one can't quite disbelieve it either," said Dr. Frank Slater Jr., principal of Newark Valley High School, as he seemed to summarize the mixed feelings of this small community caught up in a "saucer" mystery.

When one of its residents unfolded a story straight from the "Outer Limits" recently, he startled his neighbors and most of the surrounding country to belief, disbelief, uncertainty, and intense curiosity.

Gary T. Wilcox, 27-year-old dairy farmer who runs his place by himself several miles northeast of the village, claims to have met and talked with two "alien beings" while working his fields last April 24.

Dressed in what appeared to be seamless clothing with full- length hoods, the two beings emerged from an egg-shaped craft which hovered just above the ground, according to Wilcox.

Resembling aluminum, he estimated the craft was about 20 feet long and 16 feet wide, and seemed to be of a shiny metal unlike anything he had ever seen. The two humanoids were about four feet tall and appeared to have arms and legs, though he could not tell whether fingers were also a part of their anatomy. They concealed their features.

"We are from planet Mars," they volunteered to the astonished farmer, who explained that he and his friend had talked to people before.

Suspecting a "practical joke," Wilcox said he continued to talk with them, learning that they were interested in why he used certain fertilizers on his fields and in certain chemical materials in general.

They explained that on Mars, food was grown in the atmosphere, but that "changes in the universe" had occurred them to examine other means of production.

Wilcox said that each one explained to him that the aliens had warned him against telling of the visit, but that he felt it was only a duty to notify the authorities.

FBI agents were notified and reportedly have been questioning local authorities. Meanwhile, another resident reported the Wilcox farm was the scene of a "predation" - earth astronauts'? - and the area was roped off for a time. Helicopters were observed, apparently scanning the area.

As for the Valley residents, there are those who scoff at the idea and those who just aren't sure anymore. As Slater put it, whose students have been talking about it, "One can't believe it, but one can't quite disbelieve it either."

The document describes how five children claimed to have seen a "little man" wearing a helmet and plastic goggles, who made "strange clicking sounds" and then walked back to a nearby saucer and climbed in, as the children ran away in panic. The document also mentions a related incident in Newark Valley, New York, where a farmer named Gary Wilcox claimed to have talked with two little men from a flying saucer on April 24th. The text provides details about these two incidents and references a previous report in the project's "Non-Scheduled Newsletter #21".

ANOTHER LANDING IN NEW YORK: Some time in mid July, five children in the village of Conklin, near Binghamton, New York, claimed to have seen a "little man" wearing a helmet and plastic goggles, who came up to them making "strange clicking sounds." The creature then walked back to his nearby saucer and climbed in, as the children ran away in panic.

Mrs. Edmund Travis, mother of two of the youngsters, questioned them closely and threatened them with punishment if they were not telling the truth. She said that she also questioned them separately, and that their stories were "pretty much the same." Mrs. Travis showed a newspaper reporter the spot where the spaceship is supposed to have landed. The moss in the area appeared to be dead and matted.

It will be remembered that in nearby Newark Valley, N.Y., a farmer named Gary Wilcox claimed that two little men from a flying saucer talked with him in English on April 24th. The above incident tends to confirm his story, which was described in detail in our September issue.

"Kent, Ohio - 25 April, 1964 - 8:30 p.m.
Three objects were seen in a field about 800 yards from witness' home at Glenda Glen. The objects appeared to be parked. The first two objects were lens-shaped, one yellow-white and the other orange. They were seen side by side through the willow trees. They stood out prominently among the trees. The highest object was oval-shaped, yellow-white. The second object over rose straight up over the willow trees and hovered briefly 5 to 7 feet above its base. It was about 15 feet in diameter and its shape was that of a dome or an ellipse. It too, went out of sight in the distance. The third object started at a slight angle to the right, passed over about 200 yards, then red three times and vanished. They weren't positive, but they thought the object had stopped during the blinking. The second object was compared to a light aircraft (150 MPH). The first and third objects were estimated to be 1,500 feet away when first seen. All objects were soundless. No trail or other lights. Duration - 30 minutes. Sighted compared to a light aircraft (150 MPH)."

Southampton again

Mr. Peter J. Kelly sends us yet another signed letter from the Southampton 5th form, dated April 29 and was witnessed by a Fifth Form teacher, David Lawrence.

David Lawrence said that when he first saw the object, it appeared was an aeroplane near the cloud height, and might have been about the size of a large aircraft.

"At a football match at Testwood ground, I was standing near my husband. When a man near me asked her husband, 'What's that in the sky?' (he lifted it to a star). Her husband replied, 'It is a cloud and they paid no more attention.

'Mr. Kelly thought it was just a small puff of cloud, but I considered it stationary and this object was slowly travelling in a north-east direction.

'It appeared as a rough disc and of a grey-coloured. It was also tilted slightly, and seemed to become brighter, in appearance it looked as if a verit out and became brighter, in my opinion."

UFO FLITS OVER WYOMING

Rock Springs, Wyoming, April 29 - A high-flying disc was seen in the western sky by a group of students, another student, a junior high school teacher named Richard Surline, and another man named Keith Boyes.

The first group of students observed the object as it appeared to turn and present a flat side and edge. A glow emanated from the sides.

Surline reported the object to be a black discolored disc, first seen at a distance but apparently got brighter and nearer. 

Mr. Keith Boyes phoned Surline at about 12:30 p.m. to determine if the latter had seen the same object. Surline continued to observe the object until 2:30 p.m. The second group described the object as wobbling, turning, and of a green color that turned to silver. Presumably it was visible during the entire afternoon and early evening. It was last reported moving eastward with occasional disappearance behind a cloud.

TWO SAUCER LANDINGS IN CALIFORNIA: On the night of April 30th, a mysterious dome-shaped object which had landed near Route 91, reported being a gigantic aircraft about 10 miles of Bakerfield, California. Mrs. Gloria Glover, a housewife, first saw it as a water tower, but as we got closer we knew it was something else. Mrs. Biggs, her husband, and their 20-year old son watched the object for about 5 minutes while their car was moving. It then disappeared suddenly from a hilltop near when they looked up. Their car engine died and they waited two hours for it to come alive again.

Las Vegas Mystery: We are indebted to the following for about five or six minutes while watching the following: "Two women were motoring on a highway near Las Vegas, Nevada, when an unidentified flying object appeared from behind a hilltop. The object departed from the hilltop at a rapid speed in the direction of Las Vegas. About a mile or so further on, the same or a similar object was seen again. It seemed to be silvery or aluminum colored and disk or saucer-shaped in appearance. Mrs. Lorene Ayers, all of Fontana, California, told authorities they had no explanation for the object. They also stated they were not playing tricks or playing a hoax. The object was within the 'Thursday's pictures to the right' on the hilltop, just off U.S. Highway 95, near to Las Vegas."

Green River, Wyoming, saucer

Two families peered into the sky here on Thursday evening while a delivery, shining, round object hovered red high over their heads for about 30 minutes. 

"We saw something--whether it was a flying saucer, we don't know," said Mrs. James Pace, 118 Smith Dr. But "we were not imaginative people."

Mrs. Pace told the Desert News that she, her husband and two of her children were on the front lawn with Robert Cameron, about 7 p.m. They were watching, she reported, a "peculiar" object in the sky, "a silvery disk reflecting the sunlight."

When the children, Susanne Pace, 9, Michael Pace, 5, and Kevin Cameron, 5, pointed higher in the sky and shouted "There's another flying saucer, just like the one we saw yesterday in school."

Mrs. Pace had dismissed her children's stories of flying saucers over the school as "just creations of 'kid's' imaginations."

"But this time I couldn't believe my eyes," Mrs. Pace said. The object was "shining, round light," standing on its edge like a silver dollar, it was very bright in the sky." 

The Paces theorized the shiny effect was merely a reflection of the sun, after the object's lights went out and became dark. Mr. and Mrs. Cameron viewed the object, which appeared to be hovering, for about five minutes before it disappeared into the half-dark storm clouds and obscured it.

"This was the day before when the kids were talking about saucers, I thought they were just making it up," Mrs. Pace said. Then I read in the paper about the 'Flying Saucer' seen in Salt Lake Valley, I guess that's what we saw."

Mrs. Pace said she found that children throughout the neighborhood and those attending nearby Roosevelt Elementary School had reported seeing unidentified flying objects on Thursday.

"Meanwhile, in Salt Lake Valley, twelve-year-old boy said on Friday he saw an object hover for a minute or two" in the sky, then dart behind a mountain.

Mr. Clympus and Mrs. Nicole Beglarian, 2902 Florence Dr., (2900 East), said the object hovered about 5,000 feet above Mt. Olympus before disappearing.

Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

I am enclosing a toasted copy of a AFPR0 bulletin. Please notice the reported Air Force secrecy, and I feel that it would be very wise to track this one down but things like this are All possible. Apparently there was some conversation between the bomber pilot and the tower which the radio amateur accidentally overheard, but nothing like radio, and the very beginning, I gives at this late date, but at the very least, the radio amateur and the newspaper reporter should be contacted to see just what was the original stimulus was.

I am also enclosing a toasted copy of a note from Mr. English. He was the one who reported the Toledo case which was rather similar to the Montecello case, which I rode to do some studying and since Reference 18 August 1954, 200 miles east of Dover (Atlantic), would it be possible to get the names of the crew members concerned? I would like to write to them and have them give us a completely independent estimate of what they saw. It appears that these people were between two cloud decks and may an object descending and a relatively stationary balloon which they were overtaking and passed. Since everything over the Atlantic is carefully checked by radar, I would be very interested to know if their radar showed anything at the same time and also whether they ever saw it to the rear of the plane.

Last Sunday I took occasion while lecturing around to call this German professor at the Eastern Mennonite College in Harrisonburg, Virginia. This is the case of the college custodian who claimed various invitations to come into the college from the sideband "saucers". He told me how the object which he said was a bright blue color, some feet in diameter, and how it came up from the ground and hovered about him, and eventually shot up and disappeared. I would ask you if you could find out from the ONI report file or other authoritative sources, what is known about this incident, since it seems to be one of the relatively few cases where apparently something has been seen on the ground, and also to ascertain if the college custodian, who is obviously a wholly reliable person, could be located and interviewed by someone from the Air Force in order to get a first-hand account.

Landing . . .

We had also heard about the landing but had not been able to confirm it. However, we did follow up the story and obtained the following details.

On April 12, 1964, Mr. and Mrs. Norman Paulson were driving on a road near the Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana. They observed a bright light coming down from the sky and landing approximately 1/4 mile from the road. The object appeared to be suspended above the ground for a short time and then set down.

There are, of course, details which could not be covered by a telephone conversation, so we endeavored to obtain more information.

We called the Paulsons and asked if they would be willing to fill out a questionnaire for us. They readily agreed. This questionnaire was mailed to them and returned, completed, on April 22, 1964.

The following is a summary of the information obtained: 

According to the Paulsons, the object they observed was oval-shaped, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and about 15 to 20 feet thick. It was a bright metallic color, which changed to a dull red color during the landing. There was a faint humming sound coming from the object.

When the object was first sighted, it was traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately 1000 mph. As it approached the ground, the speed decreased and the object made a slight wobbling motion before landing.

After landing, the object remained in position for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, then took off straight up at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately 1000 mph. As it climbed, it accelerated rapidly and soon disappeared from sight.

The Paulsons reported that they were quite frightened by the incident and that a few minutes after the object took off, it began to thunder and lightning. They stated that they were certain that they had not seen any conventional aircraft and that the object they observed was definitely of an unusual nature.

Several other people in the area apparently also observed the landing, but the Paulsons were the only ones we were able to contact. We have been unable to obtain any confirmation from other witnesses.

The Paulsons are both highly respected citizens of their community and there is no reason to doubt their sincerity or the factual nature of their report. We feel that this incident is worthy of serious consideration and further investigation.

When the Air Force was contacted about this report, they stated that they had no information about it. Since it is outside the normal channels of reporting, it is doubtful if the Air Force would be aware of it. We shall endeavor to obtain more information about this case and report any further developments.

UFO LANDS AT AIR FORCE BASE
Holloman AFB - White Sands Proving Ground Integrated
Test Range.
The loudspeaker at Main Control blared these electrifying
words: "The get a UFO!" It was April 30, 1964, just the day
after Lonnie Zamora spotted the landed object at Socorro.
Upon being questioned, the B-57 pilot replied: "It's egg-
shaped and white." "Any markings?" asked Control. "None
as Socorro," the pilot said. "We lost sight of the object. It
seemed to be making another pass." 5.7 minutes later, the
B-57 pilot told Main Control, "It's on the ground."
Then radio communications ceased. Photo crews were asked
to stand by.
Ground observers concluded that a UFO was in landing at Holloman
under heavy guard.
Other unidentified lights had been sighted on the Range,
during April, prior to Zamora's sighting. Another involved a
guard who saw a UFO on the ground at night. Helicopter pilots
reported seeing lights, the attempted to side arm at the object.
they then fled, with the UFO seemingly in hot pursuit. He reached 
Base HQ and was so badly shaken, he was hospitalized.
Attempts by the Lorenzens to verify the rumors have been
unsuccessful.
Visual Observation on May 15, between 11:30
A.M. and 12:15 P.M. Surveillance...Radar as well as TV-16
cameras at Stallion Site, tracked two objects in the area North of
Socorro. The objects were described as "white or light in color,
circular in shape, side-by-side flight, separating, then rejoining
each other, and accelerating and up and down (zigzag) maneuvers."
Visual confirmation was made by a trained radar operator
who saw the two objects he described them as brown and football-
shaped. The objects "were flying at low altitude and disappeared
beyond buildings at the instrumentation side where the radar
operators are them visually.

CANYON FERRY RESERVOIR, MONTANA
REPORT FORM

LOCATION OF SIGHTING: Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana
DATE/TIME: 8 April 1964, 2100 hours (9:00 P.M.)
DURATION OF SIGHTING: Approximately 1 minute

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S): The object was described as a luminous, greenish-white light which moved quickly across the sky from west to east. It appeared stationary for a few seconds, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.

AUTOPSY REPORT: Not applicable. 

INVESTIGATOR'S NOTES: The witness was a reliable, sober individual who was familiar with aircraft and natural phenomena. His description of the object's movement and appearance was consistent with other reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. No known aircraft or natural phenomenon could adequately explain the sighting.

CONCLUSION: Unidentified

UAO LANDING IN NEW MEXICO
The Southwest Flap
We are deeply indebted to many people for the information which comprises the following report. We would like to name them so that the members would know the kind of teamwork which made the following report possible:
Ayram Brue, Alamogordo Daily News; Terry Gross, KALG Radio, Alamogordo; Kent Mecey, Las Cruces Sun News, Las Cruces, New Mexico; Police, as well as numerous contacts who prefer that their identities remain unknown. 
This report will consist of the facts of the Zamora sighting, which brought the UFO into sharp focus in the latter part of April, and the day-by-day, blow-by-blow account of the entire investigation as it developed.
As interesting as the sightings themselves are, the ways, as the sightings themselves.
At 5:50 p.m. on Friday evening, 24 April 1964, Lonnie Zamora, a policeman of the Socorro, New Mexico City Police, was proceeding south at high speed on South Park Street in pursuit of a speeding car. As he drew abreast of the Church of the Good Shepherd, his attention was attracted by a loud roaring sound and out of the corner of his eye, to the southwest, he saw a flame which disappeared down to the southwest. As policemen often must, he thought quickly, made his decision and steered his car off into the gullies southwest of town. He felt he knew the speeding motorist anyway, and his first impression of the near and the flame was that it was "feeling around in there," referring to the dynamite shack which was located in the general direction of the blue flame he had seen.
At this point, and for only a few seconds (See Landing--Page 3)

ends, the ability to the sound of him was like a soft hissing noise, and the object, which, from that distance (450 feet) appeared to be an oversized car (standing on end) with two children's size dissipated lids on the top, which he thought looked like mechanics' tools, one of them appeared to turn to a man who took his mike down and called Chavez, asking for assistance. He asked him to come alone.

Zamora gave his car up and across the area where he stopped it. He then heard two loud metallic banging noises. He got out of his car and in the area where he had seen the object he noticed it was automatically picked up and put back in place. He took these steps towards the fully and could see the object down the shrubbery. Suddenly it little to his left. Suddenly it rose up rapidly in the air and took off at a great speed westerly as it was wide.

As they rose suddenly and quite suddenly and Zamora stopped in his tracks and looked around. The object began heading southwesterly at a varying speed. It was ascending at a very shallow altitude when it cleared the hill. There were more strange sounds from the object but could do anything in the southwest. Unfortunately they could not say anything, probably because of the excitement of seeing the object, shot out sight and at such a low altitude that it would not have been visible down because of trees and buildings, within minutes, Chavez pulled his patrol car, all sirens buzzing hurried toward him.

"You look like you've seen the devil!" Zamora asked.

Chavez replied, "You look like you've seen the devil too!"

"Well, maybe I have," Zamora said, and related his experience. The two men then walked to the edge of the gully and looked at the ground where the object had been. Several clumps of range grass were

There were four 8-12-inch wedgeshaped depressions, 3 to 4 inches deep arranged in an uneven rectangle. There were also four smaller depressions about 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep not far from the point of the large indentations.

The Investigation

The first word to arrive at the B. site was Lt. Col. Harry Whiffen of the Alamogordo D Research Information Center, Holloman Air Force Base, Lynn Bruer of the Alamogordo D News in Alamogordo as II a.m. on Saturday, the 25th. Mr. and Mrs. Zamora were then preparing for interviews with U.S. Air Force and other investigators. Dr. G. Wehner, a local psychiatrist, was one type of lily often called "cactus lily" had been cut back, near the Zamora home. The Deputy Sheriff in charge, apparently who was at the scene was in Socorro at the time. Holder and another man came out to the site, took photographs and examined the rocks around the indentations to preserve them. Zamora and Deputy Sheriff Chavez searched Zamora's car for any equipment that would have been used to make the indentations. They found none.

After describing the call from Zamora, Chavez, who had been fingerprinting a prisoner, returned to the scene to an inspection. He had been instructed to go south Park Street. Later, when he returned, the lieutenant (whose name he could not recall) told Chavez that he had looked into Zamora's car to see if there were any implements or evidence that could have been affected. There was not, said Chavez, and he felt he could have been affected. There was not, said Chavez, and he felt he could have been better qualified to assist in the initial investigation. 

All questions concerning Zamora's request for "a good man" Chavez felt that he was seeing something unusual and wanted a sympathetic observer to share his experience. All questions were met by Chavez with absolute endorsement. He was personally convinced that Zamora's report was legitimate. The "general consensus" among local law enforcement officers and friends - Police Chief Poole of Socorro as well as other higher authorities - was simply, "If it's a good man, Chavez has it."

Zamora asked Chavez if he wanted further directions, and Zamora's call if police personnel at headquarters could do something in the vicinity of the Berino, New Mexico, Deputy Sheriff Chavez. He opened his car and went to the dynamic back location, arriving just behind Chavez. He had observed the markings on the ground and the indentations.

(Continued from Page 3)
Zamors said he had been instructed by Intelligence not to talk about them, but the Army contingent at Stallion Site did. He would not give the Army the point, they did not press that issue. Zamors also said he was told not to sign anything about the markings. He sent in his request to Chaves for him to come to the site alone. It was felt that Zamors might have felt a little embarrassed about finding markings when others did not.
Thus, the interview with Zamoras was not very long and immediately called Captain Holder on the telephone and asked him about his request that Zamora not discuss the markings. Holder said that those higher asked him not to inform them whether or not other future sightings were reported. The Lorenzens believed him—he seemed to be an intelligent young man attempting to do a which appeared to have been a good job.
When the sighting was first being checked out by the Lorenzens it continues without sufficient evidence upon which to develop such action. They decided to tell them that he had called and talked to Zamora and that he had cautioned him not to talk about the "little men" to newsmen. This was the only incident during the whole investigation which indicated to any move the investigators to check further.
Later, even after talking to the Lorenzens, Zamora changed his story from "little men" to a "pair of what looked like women, it is easy to see" and the various eyewitness accounts of man-shaped white things seems to have been their first reporters.
One part of the investigation was interested in and enlisting: When the Lorenzens returned from the landing site, Chaves had to transmit a prisoner by telephone, etc. While he was busy within about a half hour the telephone rang and the call was for Chaves. Mr. Lorenzens believed it was for Chavez. Shortly the Sergeant came in and took the call and he and Mrs. L. took up their conversation about the Zamora incident where they had left off.
the Air Force should have been on the scene, by for that time, said he later decided that as a matter of fact a Major from Kirkland and a Sergeant "back east" were waiting for him in the hall outside, but Lt. Lorenzen didn't down to the dispatcher's office.
On the way they met Mr. L. talking to an Air Force Sergeant whom he instructed as SSgt Moody of WAFB and told Zamora and the Major that the UFO situation briefing. The Major did not participate.
Moody did not seem to be familiar with current UFO sightings and Mrs. L. related some of the more interesting incidents with Zamora. He seemed to be a little embarrassed. Later, Mrs. Lorensen, who had not participated in the first part of the discussion, was told about it by the Major who chatted with Chavez. 
When Mr. L. left Mrs. L. to look for Chavez, he saw the Air men in the hall stopped and instructed Britten to leave because they had no reason for being there. They discussed that he had found out that the Major had been notified by his superior by the incident and seen why he was there. Moody mentioned a a paper half-dazed and smart-alec observer. When Moody mentioned a Ground who had claimed "contact" and names written in book as well as conversation generally considered to be "fanciful" of the UFO field. In Rosario, a research group cut its heads to the effects. Lorensen. She's a nut. 
Mr. Lorensen to simply. "She's my wife." It was apparent that Moody had a nervous and turned to Major Connors and said, "She's a wife and the we've said to Mr. L. looked the remarks as he was enjoying the AF men's discomfort. Immediately, they were making valuable observation on this personally characteristics incident.

just as he picked up on Moss-2. Also, the two sets of round indentations are placed where they would be where a ladder was placed to descend. The door occupants could descend the ladder as it was placed once, did not set solidly and the position was changed. This would indicate that the "feel" of the ladder had spread bases for support.
The incident took place within 300 yards of a heavily traveled road - US. The individual in the case was traveling between El Paso, Texas and Albuquerque, New Mexico. From the gully itself, only the top portion of the object up to the trees to the north, were visible. Therefore the location was perfect cover for anyone who did not want to be seen. 
Two days after the incident, Opal Grinder, a filling station attendant at Socorro, heard about the incident and related an incident on his station on a day prior (just before it) on a slightly varying evening.
A large car pulled in for gas and the driver apparently announced the purpose. The driver said, "How's that?" The man said, "Gonna looking thing almost like a flying saucer, flying low in the canyon." The policeman in a patrol car was headed out into the desert after it at a high rate of speed. 
Grinders was informed there that some of the range men had seen an object and that it was probably just a helicopter. The motorist said that when he drove up, he saw a lighted object hovering for a matter of seconds.
The foregoing seems to bear out the fact if the car was an official car, it has the marks of one in pursuing a speeding helicopter or something. If Grinders one realizes that it is true, then the driver in not having been told does not know of it. But through again he'll mention the incident and he Grinders has no clue to the identity of the man concerned. Except that he remembers the man had used a credit card and could not be traced in that manner. The station ran short of business as it would have been difficult after 45 hours, so they have determined the incident was related to the APFO Grinders has no clue - Zarnora and Chaves told Soco
rro that the object landed close to Socorro, that it was equipped with a landing gear of some kind. The terrain in that valley was very rough and broken and the condition suggested the close proximity to the rough terrain as well as the fact that gear on the "low" side of the object reached so close to the ground.
The condition of the ground and vegetation suggests the presence of heat which scorched and burned vegetation from the spot described by Mrs. Lorenzo's article in the August issue of 1957 magazine.
The, J. Alan Hynek, head of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University, who was on the Scene for Air Force-sponsored investigation with the opinion that there was an intensity of heat at the site for a short while. This is corroborated the statement, of course, based on the knowledge of the technicians who made the investigation of Zamora's story simply because the photographs confirmed the range of the object described when compared with our technology, I believe it lies within the range of physical theory.

"On their recent last visit to Socorro, they were greeted with friendly enthusiasm by the personnel at police headquarters. The latest revelation made by Chavez was that J. Alan Hynek had spoken highly of Mr. and Mrs. Lorenzen and APRO, and that of all the people who visited their work, they appreciated and liked. Chavez mentioned the researchers who showed up during the occurrence, and seemed to be one of those enthusiasts who does a good job of undercutting any civilian research he is told claims. This one said that he has always believed in UFOs and seen a UFO at will—apparently they have an affinity for him—or something."

Just another couple of interesting sidelights: During the conversation with Moody, he admitted to Mrs. Lorenzen that they (APRO) get more reports than we (the USAF project at Wright-Patterson) do." We interpret this in the light of our contention that the Air Force is conducting the public relations show."

Objects Seen, Socorro - 1963
Near the 1966 spring UFO flap in western New Mexico, on the following Saturday morning, April 24, 1964, at about 5:50 p.m. on a summer night in 1963 (no exact date), Mr. and Mrs. John A. Kaplan watched three lights (objects) through their picture window on the east wall. The Kaplans and their three children observed the object as it moved slowly eastward. It brightened and dimmed alternately as it moved eastward, rose and cleared the mountains which, as it moved westward, rose again. They were not frightened and discontinued their observation about 10 p.m.

In about 10 minutes the object a Mrs. J. Cardwell observed the arc motion might account for the bright flach it corresponded to the movement.

Huge Light Buzzed Car
In New Mexico
Two days before the Zamora sighting in Socorro, New Mexico, Theresean Mrs. Marie Morrow and a friend, Ruth Ovelette and Mrs. Morrow's 5-year-old son, were driving east of Lordsburg, New Mexico, headed for Tucson. It was about 8 p.m. when the huge light buzzed their car. The light, which appeared to be 10 feet above the top of the car, was so bright "as day". The inside of the car was lighted and both Mrs. Morrow and Ruth said the object appeared to be about 10 feet, at the most, above the top of Mrs. Morrow's car. It made a "whirring" sound, and was as bright as the light of a welder's torch.

THE UNITED STATES AIR
FORCE CHANGES ITS TUNE
A remarkable admission

READERS of the London Evening Standard on April 30 must have been surprised to read: 'There's no threat, U.S. verdict.' Even those who word quite confident that the saucers had been regarded as a serious menace by the American military, paused momentarily. If they then read the report that followed they found even more reason to be astonished.

'The United States air force says it has investigated sightings of more than 6,000 unidentified objects but found no evidence that they represent a threat to U.S. security.'

The report goes on to say that 85% of the sightings failed to turn up any evidence that 'UFOs' are alien interplanetary space vehicles under some form of intelligent control.

'This report was given as the Air Force looked into sightings in the area of Socorro, New Mexico.'

Silence of the Air Force's leading civilian consultants on UFOs has gone to Socorro, New Mexico, to investigate the latest reports.'

The latest report from Dr. J. Allen Hynek, "Scientist Astrophysicist" and Consultant to the U.S. Air Force, discloses that of the 6,128 reported cases, many remain "unidentified."

So the average has risen.
The first admission that must be put is why it was though necessary to return to a subject that might have been thought to have been killed by the earlier ridicule and misrepresentation by the authorities.

The fighting details that follow probably explain why: it was necessary  to make this report at this time, because of the facts which have been gathered during recent years and the way in which the U.S. Air Force has admitted to a total of more than 6,000 sightings in 16 years, they are now saying that they are having trouble with the evidence, "Knowing the methods of the Air Force on both sides of the Atlantic this is a remarkably high figure, for the 600 sightings must have been truly sensational to have withstood the weather balloons, seagulls and other more mundane explanations.

was admitted that they were real, the public might accuse Russia. In that case it was necessary to drop the line that they could be inter-planetary, through which we gathered no evidence that they were. Any septic person confronted with a remarkable statement, but if he had any reasonable reason to doubt it must discard it. While some have insisted that the UFOs, whatever they were, were real. Indeed, the statement as reported in the Saturday Evening Post and Review of the FLYING SAUCER REVIEW, the military nature of the observers is hypoteical but if it is taken as fact it would not alter the views of the FLYING SAUCER REVIEW. While the REVIEW has evidence that they are interpellations it has no absolute proof.
U.S.Air Force admissions which led to the sensational disclosure of American recoperation in a number taken from the local Las Cruces Sun-News for April 26, Zamora, who is a Socorro policeman that he saw an egg-shaped flying object land near here has the FBI and military authorities interested.
Zamora said he saw the object but also saw two occupants who alighted when the object traveled southweed of Socorro. In conclusion, Chavez said he received a "State police Report, Sam Chavez said he received a call indicating the site would be inspected by someone from Washington.
Officer Zamora tells his experience: While in his patrol car about 5.50 p.m. he heard what he thought was an explosion in the area. When a aground was about 300 yards of the draw where he spotted what appeared to be an overturned car. Closer he saw two figures in white moving about outside the vehicle. One looked directly at him. He Zamora marveled at the bizarre nature of what he was viewing. He continued driving to the draw and parked. He was about 100 feet of the object, a brilliant white metal, rise and tower about 20 feet off the ground. It then appeared to become larger and receded into the distance and took off "I was scared," said Zamora, when he heard the deep roar. It thought it was going to blow up. Zamora joined him and both approached the site of the apparent landing. They found scorched ground and burned weeds. They also found four 1-1/2 inch depressions in the ground which apparently had supported a heavy object.

CASE REPORT FORM

SUBJECT: Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana

DATE OF SIGHTING: April 8, 1964

LOCATION: Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana

DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 4:45 P.M. on April 8, 1964, a resident of the Canyon Ferry Reservoir area observed a metallic, disc-shaped object hovering over the reservoir. The object was estimated to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and appeared to be silent. It hovered for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

INVESTIGATION: An investigation of the sighting was conducted by the United States Air Force under Project Blue Book. Photographic evidence was obtained, but the quality of the images was poor and did not provide any clear details about the observed object.

CONCLUSION: The investigation was unable to determine the nature of the object observed over the Canyon Ferry Reservoir. The case remains unresolved.

NEW PATROLMAN REPORTS MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS
Patrolman Lonnie Zamora, who interrupted his patrol shortly after 5:45 p.m. on April 24, 1964 to investigate what he thought was a car that had rolled off the road into a canyon near Socorro, New Mexico, said he came upon a strange sight that close to his life. 
The object Zamora saw, about the size of a car, was suspended about 3 feet off the ground, hovering over the desert area. It appeared to be occupied. It was low-slung, about 15 feet in length, and had a shiny, aluminum-color surface. As Zamora approached it, the object rose vertically and made a roaring sound like a jet. Within seconds, it had disappeared from sight, leaving deep impressions in the desert soil where it had been resting.
Zamora claims that he saw two persons, about 5 feet tall, near the object, and as it rose in the air, a red emblem "like a Devil's Trident" appeared on the side. The object itself had no wheels, ports, or landing gear. Another strange report donates the presence of some object, possible a UFO, which was sighted over the Canyon Ferry Reservoir near Helena, Montana, on April 15, 1964.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Six feet was allegedly egg-shaped, approximately 30 feet in diameter, with two protrusions resembling antenna or stanchions, apparently a form of landing gear. It was later developed that the object had been observed by others, apparently a form of landing gear. In truth, four of these radar-like legs or supporting members were visible . A photographer named a former Colonel Zamora stated: "A tremendous noise or blast similar to the noise from the noise escape of a jet airplane of the supersonic type that now fly before him.

Charvez and Luckie reported burned gums of grass and crushed bushes where the object had lain, which were still smoldering upon their arrival. It appeared to have been landed simultaneously. At four locations where the craft's landing gear had touched the Earth, on a subsequent inspection of the scene, they determined the holes to be shallow, about 6 inches long, by six inches wide. They did not appear to have been made by an object.

The witnesses, not contended to describe what they actually saw, were embroidering inconsequential details which could not be investigated or substantiated. The account of the sighting, Hynek stated, not one of the most reliable ones he has had, is one of the sounding of the best substantiated reports. Usually, one finds many contradictory or incredulous - details, but, on this case, the details seemed to hold up on investigation. However, the eyewitness, who carefully observed what he saw, certainly was not of a caliber we usually term cranks or visionaries.
The witnesses reported seeing what was described as a very bright, hovering object on the southern horizon. It was estimated to be about the size of the setting moon and pulsed or flashed at irregular intervals. A local resident, who had apparently observed the same phenomenon in the same general location sometime earlier, also reported the incident.

The image contains a photograph of a symbol that appears to be related to UFO reports. The text does not mention any humans in the image, so I will describe the image as objectively as possible without identifying any individuals.

The image shows a symbol that resembles an upside-down triangle or "V" shape with a line underneath. The text states that this is a "Do You Recognize This Symbol?" and provides some information about it, indicating that it is an "artist's drawing based on a sketch by Socorm, N.M. Police Officer Lonnie Zamora" and that it is related to a UFO sighting reported in Socorrro, New Mexico. The text also mentions that the symbol was used by Air Force officers to classify UFO reports that they wanted to see if others had observed.

We did learn something - there

Unless there was another landing
the "captured" UFO would be the
one involved in the April 30 landing, which would mean a motorized
ground patrol must have come upon the UFO while its occupants
were some distance from it and
prevented their re-entering the
craft. I do not know of any UFO
landing incident in which the occupants ever got very far away
from their craft, and the Cannon
landing demonstrates their amazing speed and ability to escape close
observation. Also, the size and
amount of noise of a 15-27 make it
impossible to believe the occupants
of the April 30 UFO were unaware
of its presence. It is difficult to
put any credence in the rumor of
the "captured" object in a hangar
at Holloman and remain objective.
All of my sources trace back to a
single airman who spoke of the
"captured" UFO.

It does seem that inasmuch as our
continies could find no further corroborotiion, as they did find for
the incidents of April 30 and May
15 and 20, that the fellow was
either making a bid for attention
and/or was mistakenly excited by
a closely guarded hangar.
But, frankly, I believe the ac-
count of the frightened guard who
stumbled upon the UFO at night.
And I do know that the civilian
population in the vicinity of Hol-

about the continuing sightings.
I also have information indicating that the military at Holloman

thoroughly instrumented test bases
in the United States, are concerned

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The text is a report discussing UFO sightings, particularly in the state of Arizona. It mentions three UFO landings in the state and describes the objects that were sighted. The report also discusses the activities of the APRO (Aerial Phenomena Research Organization) and their investigations into UFO reports. The text does not identify any individuals but rather focuses on the details of the UFO sightings and investigations.

UFO LANDS AT AIR FORCE BASE

SINCE THE August issue of
FATE was printed there were
three UFO landings in the state of
Arizona, the most significant near
highways or roads. Colorado,
Wyoming and Montana have ex-
perienced similar visitation.

The thread of continuity which
runs throughout the fabric of the
Spring 1964 sightings consists of
major features:

The objects which landed or
hovered did so on straight lines on
the map.

They landed in areas where
eventually they would be seen, but
where they would be inaccessible
and, therefore, safe.

Of all the sightings gathered by
APRO since April 26 there have
been only three of the "explana-
tions" not located on previously establish-
ished straight lines.

EPORTS CURRENTLY are
coming into APRO's office
from around the United States as
well as the Fiji Islands and Aus-
tralia. It looks like they are just
"opening" for what may be ahead.

The Spring 1964 impresses
me as the intelligence community car-
ried out by the occupants of the
UFOs, either to show themselves, or
preparatory to closer contact in the
future or to find out the effect
such contact would have on hu-
mans or how much we are already sus-
pect.

The press and TV and radio
work very well and serve to feed
the most part, silent about UFOs
or adhering to the prescribed "there
ain't no such thing" party-line of
officialdom since 1952. Perhaps
the UFO occupants have made a
number of landings in places where
they would be certain to be ob-
served, then retired to a safe place
to monitor local TV and radio in
order to learn the effects of their
visits on the natives.

A similar operation took place
over a geographically similar area,
with comparatively sparse popula-
tion, in northeast Brazil on May
13, 1960, just a few months before
Mars and Earth made a close pass
in space.

Mars and Earth will be close
again in March, 1965.

ECAUSE OF the establishment
of a straight-line pattern in
the civilian sightings of UFOs in
the Southwest in April and early
May (see August FATE) I decided

illa, Alamos, Colo., to Cheyenne,
Wyo., and of which locations
of sighted UFOs. However, we can-
not assure the Holloman landing
falls on one of the lines, but can
only reiterate that three of the pre-
viously established orthogonal lines
do intersect the north Holloman
Range section.

The interesting thing about these
four new sighting lines (and there
may be more, of course) is that
the UFOs were seen on a military
base during the time (from April
30 onward!) that military represen-
tatives were busily debriefing various
civilian sightings of similar objects
as misinterpretations of conven-
tional objects or hoaxes. I believe
this series of sightings, demon-
strates that the Air Force program
is merely an attempt to explain
away the UFOs, and the really seri-
ous work of evaluation, correla-
tion, etc., is being done elsewhere.

The Air Force's official statement
that it was "unfortunate that only
one witness reported the Socorro

object, and that no photos were ob-
tained" is clearly an attempt to dis-
credit the Socorro sighting on the
basis of the lack of corroborating
witnesses. The Air Force has immed-
iately was put into an embarrassing
position since Dr. Lincoln La Paz,
a noted meteorologist who knows
Zamora personally, endorsed its
integrity and reliability.

It was during any investigation
of the New Mexico flap that I
learned of the existence of an agency
called the "UFO Board," comprised
of military and civilian scientists,
to whom the reports go for evalu-
ation and study.

AF Regulation 200-2, much quot-
ed among UFO enthusiasts, in-
structs local UFO officers on how
to investigate a UFO sighting, and
serves as a guide for public in-
formation of officers concerning what
can or cannot be said about a
given incident. If an object can be
explained a public statement can
be made; if it is inexplainable in
conventional terms no public state-
ment will be forthcoming.

The Navy and the Air Force,
however, have no unclassifed, public
regulations about how UFO inci-
dents should be handled, and these
services do not make public state-
ments about any UFO incidents.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Let that they don't have enough time and personnel to keep up with fitting. It is only normal procedure that the Air Force would be requested the task of publicly accounting for those matters as it is only the Air Force agents who have access to the actual research and evaluation would be operating behind closed doors, anonymously.

FOR MANY YEARS researchers have urged that all the facts should be told and that possible resulting hysteria is not a legitimate reason for denying the existence of UFOs. It may be an area we have not thoroughly explored.

If, early in the UFO game, certain responsible scientists and of course officials recognized the superior nature of the UFOs, accepted the fact that they were here, then we would be much better off today.

WHEN THE RAIN GOD CAME
On April 17, 1963 in Valle del Tehuacan, Mexico, the idol which had been carved from living rock about 700 A.D. had been discovered in the rains and carried into the nearby town of Coixtlahuaca. It weighs 107 tons. It was carried into Mexico City on a special truck and then, because of its weight, in some sections had to be reinforced because of the weight.

FATE

It is considered the possible hostility of the objects, they may have felt justified in creating some influence on news wire, TV, and radio networks to keep UFO information within their own official framework. It is an early as 1950 when the famous jamming of UFOs jammed radio frequencies of planes over Korea, that objects were capable of monitoring our electronic communication instantly, they instead, by "disclosing", to keep the occupants of the UFOs from revealing how much we knew or suspected about them and how some of us are to have the UFOs publicly recognized, we should be objective enough to admit that a counter-intelligence move as outlined above would be practical and necessary.

Flying Saucer' Reports Spread In New Mexico

Mexico's perennial addition to flying saucer sightings took hold of the state again with more "objects" reported to police over the weekend.

The latest, which brought out the Air Force and the deputy sheriff, was spotted early Saturday morning a few miles west of San Antonio, about 50 miles south of Socorro.

Martin Vigil said, "there was definitely something there."

He told State Police he got within 200 feet of the object during a chase. He said it looked like an egg-shaped butane tank. He said flames spewed intermittently from the bottom of the object. It was as long as a 55-gallon drum and about 14 feet in circumference, he told police.

A similar report comes from a Socorro policeman, Leonce Sanchez, who said the object was also spotted in the same area by several motorists. A campus policeman at the University of Albuquerque, George Wingenbach, said he saw an object holding a stationary position over a mountain in the Sandia Reservoirs area.

La Madera reports the ground in the area where the objects were reported to have landed was scorched and burned. Also found were markings possibly made by the landings, "like small child's print," as well as small drippings from the objects.

Until the recent sightings, the last undisputed flying object was reported over the Clovis airport April 10, where it was observed by several motorists. A campus policeman at the University of Albuquerque reported the Gallup object flying in the western sky at the same time.

REFERENCE: 1964-04-8699462-CanyonFerryReservoir-Montana 
DATE: April 8, 1964
LOCATION: Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana
INVESTIGATOR: John S. Naulty, Special Assistant to the Air Force Advisor, Project Blue Book
REPORT:
At 2145Z, on April 8, 1964, Mr. John S. Naulty, Special Assistant to the Air Force Advisor, Project Blue Book, was notified of a reported UFO sighting at the Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana. Mr. Naulty proceeded immediately to the location and commenced the investigation.
The witness, Mr. Kenneth Arnold, stated that at approximately 2130Z, while fishing at the Canyon Ferry Reservoir, he observed a bright light in the sky to the southwest. The light was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet and traveling at an estimated speed of 600-800 knots. The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before disappearing from view. 
Mr. Arnold described the object as being a single round, bright light with no discernible shape or structure. He stated that the object appeared to be under intelligent control and exhibited no characteristics of a conventional aircraft.
After a thorough on-site investigation, Mr. Naulty concluded that the reported sighting represented the observation of an unidentified flying object. The case was classified as "Unidentified" and forwarded to Project Blue Book headquarters for further analysis and evaluation.

SHARON STULL, DAUGHTER OF MR. AND MRS. L. C. STULL OF 1804 WINDSOR DR., SAID SHE WAS STANDING IN THE YARD OF HER HOME WHEN SHE SAW THE OBJECT HOVERING OVER HER HOME.
MRS. STULL SAID THAT ABOUT FOUR MINUTES AFTER SHARON FIRST OB-SERVED THE OBJECT IT DISAPPEARED. SHARON'S DOCTOR SAID HER EYES AND FACE, BOTH EYES AND NECK, WERE REDDENED, INDICATING SLIGHT SUNBURN.
SHARON SAID THAT WHILE SHE WAS WATCHING THE OBJECT, WHICH SHE DESCRIBED AS EGG-SHAPED, THERE SUDDENLY WAS A "FLASH OF LIGHT" AND SHE FELT INTENSE HEAT ON HER FACE, NECK AND HANDS. SHE SAID SHE HAD TO TURN AWAY FOR A FEW SECONDS BECAUSE OF THE BRIGHTNESS.
SHARON SAID SHE IS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT CAUSED THE LIGHT OR THE HEATING EFFECT. SHE SAID SHE COULD SEE NO EXHAUST OR FLAME FROM THE OBJECT AND IT MADE NO NOISE. 
THE WEATHER BUREAU SAID THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND SUNNY IN THE AREA AT THE TIME.
OFFICIALS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AIR FORCE'S PROJECT "BLUE BOOK," WHICH INVESTIGATES UFO REPORTS, SAID THEY WERE AWARE OF THE INCIDENT AND WERE CHECKING INTO IT.

SOCORRO REVISITED

On Saturday August 15, I drove with whose car I had rented for the day, to Socorro from Las Cruces, New Mexico. We left Las Cruces shortly before 7:30 in the morning, and arrived in Socorro about 10:30am.

The object of this visit was to obtain an overview of the feelings and opinions in Socorro about the sighting of April 24th, after several months had passed, and to find out if the principals had any afterthoughts or changes which they wished to make in their story, how they were now regarded by the townfolk, and what if any was the official opinion.

The net results of the visit which involved talking once again with Sergeant Chavez, Captain Holder, the editor of the local newspaper, and seven other townspeople, was much the same as before. Sgt. Chavez, if anything, is more reticent and withdrawn. The more articulate Sgt. Chaves still firmly believes in story, and I found no contradictions between his partial retelling of the story and the original telling of his story in late April. Although I made a distinct attempt to find a chink in armor, I simply couldn't find anyone, with the possible exception of a who has a house fairly near the site of the original sighting, who did anything but completely uphold character and reliability, and I again talked with people who had known him since childhood.

I revisited the site; the markings are still there, but very much obliterated, and this time I was able to take stereo photographs of the general terrain. I was impressed more than before with the illogical nature of the landing site. If an ordinary aircraft had been in trouble and made a forced landing, the terrain at the site is such that it would have been a miracle if any kind of aircraft could have made a successful landing.

it could have landed on the quite flat mesa just to the side of the gully, and no pilot, unless his craft were completely disabled, would have chosen to land in the rocky and uneven gully. If he had been that disabled, he certainly would not have been able to take off shortly thereafter.
Returning to the chronological account: when I arrived, neither Chaves or [REDACTED] was available, having been on duty most of the night. I talked with the radio dispatcher and a sergeant who said that he spent much of his time in mountains around the country. Both of these men were very curious about what the Air Force had found, and both volunteered that things had quieted down very much, but that there was still a big belief in [REDACTED] story. Apropos of the Air Force's story, my statement throughout the day was always the same: the Air Force is still interested and working on it; they had not found as yet a specific, logical explanation, and the results of the chemical analysis (everybody was curious about that) was that the rocks were ordinary, unaffected by the landing, and that the charred material showed only results of conventional combustion. Considerable surprise throughout the day was expressed that the Air Force had not made a more detailed analysis of the possible fuel or mechanism of the burning of the bushes, and also, incidentally, why the Air Force had not made compression tests of the ground in the area to see how much downward thrust would have been necessary to produce the observed markings.
Once again coming to the chronological story: I armed myself with about a dollar's worth of dimes and started to make telephone calls, but...

First and I visited the office of the local newspaper, the Both the owner, and the editor, (the chap who had interviewed me on my previous visit) were there, and we looked up the back numbers of papers around that time, and especially what was said after I had left. The editor remarked that there had been several UFO officials who had come to visit them, and that one had remarked, "What sort of line of bull has Hynek and the Air Force been handing you?" He also stated that they had received many letters, one from as far away as Spain. Naturally, he wanted a statement from me for his local paper, and I gave my standard statement mentioned above. The editor made one statement to the effect that they could still give full credence to story, despite the fact that there had been some opinion in town that it shouldn't be taken seriously. But, both the owner and editor said that they would continue to believe the story, unless it more proved otherwise, of course, as to their advantage to give full credence to the story, since it sells more papers.

After a full hour of chatting with the editors, during which time we also gave them a story on our new observatory in New Mexico (my story was that I was passing through, going from Boulder to Las Cruces, and that since I was passing through, I stopped to say hello and to see if there had been any recent developments). At lunchtime I lined up a number of interviews by phone for the afternoon. The results will follow:

We first talked to who is the grandmother of the latter of whom was a student in my astronomy class this spring. He chose as his term paper topic "The Socorro Flying Saucer," and it was his grandmother, who browsed around the town and picked up a lot of additional information. She had a long talk with

Text from the document:

and told us again yesterday afternoon that
Firmly believed that had been very thoroughly fright-
ened and that he had seen something supernatural. Visiting at the home (the family is apparently one of the
recognized and older families in town, and they live in quite a
hacienda), a local parish priest was also visiting at the time, and
from him in the course of conversation, we got perhaps one or two
bits of character reference on herself
The Father stated that in all
his experience, he had not come across one person who cast any aspersion on
which, he remarked, was very unusual for Socorro. herself
is obviously a very level-headed, established woman in the society of
Socorro, and when she went about investigating the case, it
appeared that she had immediate access to anyone she wished. Various
members of the faculty of the New Mexico School of Mines, for instance,
came to her immediate assistance in answering various questions, as did
Sgt. Chaves and various townspeople. One thing that she mentioned which
bears on the character reference of should be noted: the baggage
master at the station, a man in his sixties who apparently acts as a
depository of character references for all people in town, stated that he
had known for all of life and that he was one of the
most dependable people whom he'd ever known. In short, if I had any
hopes of finding some chinks in character armor, I was certainly
unable to do so.
After we left the , we then went to talk to Chaves who
was then on duty, and I talked to him privately for five or ten minutes
after which time, by prearrangement, came in. Chaves was just
about the same as he was originally, still quite articulate about the thing,

Transcribed text from the document:

and when we stated that one of the main points that continued to impress us about the whole situation was the consummate fright that had experienced (which everybody continued to tell us about), Chaves admitted that had been frightened, but indicated that perhaps part of that was prudence on part - after all, if you think that something is going to explode, it is only expedient to make yourself scarce. 

After a lengthy conversation which really added very little new to the original story, he radioed for to come in from his rounds and, in a few minutes, was with us. He seemed much more reticent than previously and never actually completed a full sentence. I think that there are at least two possible interpretations here, one being that, deep in his own mind, he may have realized that he overstated the case originally, or perhaps has even solved it, but, in view of the ingrained fear of possible ridicule, etc., he is keeping it to himself, if he feels more probably, he is simply tired of the whole thing and rather wishes that it had never come up in the first place. At least nothing that he said would indicate that he does not continue to believe that something really unusual happened.

By this time the sun was over the yardarm, and we retired to a nearby bar, where we found the editor of the there who stated again his basic faith in the story and in its character, although he did say that, for a while there, did seem to be enjoying some of the publicity. This, however, is contrary to most of the other evidence about reaction to the publicity.

tourist from himself. The time was shortly before 6 o'clock, because said that he was hurrying to get to the bank before it closed at 6pm on that Friday. He stated that this was one of the reasons why he did not pay more attention to the tourist's story. However, he said that the tourist said something to this effect: "Your planes fly awfully low here - one of them liked to knock me off the road just about when I was passing your sign coming into town." The gas sign is almost in line with the gully where the craft landed, and the logical direction from which it would have come, considering markings, etc. The tourist said that he thought that it might be a craft in trouble, and figured that was so because he saw a police car going out toward where it had landed. This would have placed the time of the craft over the tourist's car at approximately 5:35 or 5:40pm. This coincides, as well as we can see, with the time that was chasing a speeder. It indicates that the craft did not remain in the gully very long, and therefore could not have been disabled to any major extent. said then to the tourist that there are a lot of helicopters flying around the place, to which the tourist answered that, if this was a helicopter, it certainly was a strange one. promised to keep his eyes open for the tourist, but the chances of this is small.

After visiting and I went to the original site at approximately the same time of day that the original sighting occurred, and we went over the remaining marks and took some photographs, etc. We also photographed the apparent size of a man seen from the point along the road where the craft had landed which he had sighted the object which he thought was an overturned car. We also took photographs of how a large

CAR WOULD LOOK FROM THAT DIRECTION, WAS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT THE MARKS REMAINED EVEN AFTER THREE AND A HALF MONTHS OF WEATHERING, AND IT WAS HE WHO WONDERED WHETHER COMPACTION TESTS HAD BEEN MADE OF THE SOIL. 

WE THEN RETURNED TO HAVE COFFEE WITH CAPTAIN HOLDER, THE UPRANGE COMMANDING OFFICER FOR WHITE SANDS TO SEE WHETHER HE HAD ANYTHING TO ADD AFTER THIS MANY MONTHS HAD PASSED. CAPTAIN HOLDER IS STILL QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC AND REALLY FAIRLY UNNAMOURED OF THE IDEA OF STRANGE CRAFTS. IT WAS CAPTAIN HOLDER, YOU WILL REMEMBER, WHO, BURNS OF THE FBI, MADE THE ORIGINAL MEASURES BETWEEN THE MARKINGS, AND WE CALL RECALL THAT ALTHOUGH THE FIGURE WAS DRAWN POORLY, WHEN IT WAS REDRAWN ACCORDING TO DIMENSIONS GIVEN, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DIAGONALS OF THE QUADRILATERAL INTERSECTED AT EXACT RIGHT ANGLES. POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS A WELL KNOWN THEOREM WHICH STATES THAT IF THE DIAGONALS OF ANY QUADRILATERAL INTERSECT AT RIGHT ANGLES, THEN THE POINTS LIE ON A CIRCLE, THE CENTER OF WHICH IS CALLED THE MEAN CENTER OF THE FIGURE. THIS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT ONE OF THE BURNED MARKS WAS DIRECTLY AT THIS MEAN CENTER.

CAPTAIN HOLDER WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN WHAT THE AIR FORCE HAD FOUND OUT FROM THE SAMPLES WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY GATHERED WITHIN TWO HOURS OF THE SIGHTING, AND WHICH I SUBMITTED TO MD. I HOPE THAT THIS MATERIAL HAS NOT BEEN DESTROYED AFTER PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS.

are "true believers" after their sighting which, how-
ever, I feel must have been an optical phenomenon in view of the projectory
and acceleration.

Before we left, we called the retiring president of
the School of Mines, who had nothing further to offer. Before
our visit with Captain Holder, on coming back from the site, we visited
a who lives fairly close to the sighted landing
place, and maintains that he heard no loud roar and has remained skeptical
about the whole thing. He claimed that if there had been an explosion
such as claims to have heard, he certainly would have
heard it. However, this does not necessarily follow, because was
directly down wind from the gully, there was a very strong southwest
wind blowing, and the gully is on the opposite side of the hill from where
was listening. This, of course, can make a tremendous difference
in ability to hear. Further, there are trucks passing along the highway
quite close to house, and he undoubtedly is used to hearing
backfires, and truck roars of one sort or another. He was the only person
whom we talked to, however, who tended to disbelieve veracity,
indicating that it probably was a hoax. This solution is not accepdata to
the present writer, because there are just too many bits of evidence that
militate against this hypothesis.

morning, August 15th.

Project Blue Book Case No. 8699462
Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana
April 8, 1964

WITNESS STATEMENT:

On April 8, 1964, the witness was driving toward the Canyon Ferry Reservoir near Helena, Montana when he noticed an unusual aerial object in the sky. The object was metallic in appearance and shaped like a disk. It was hovering in the air and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The witness was able to take a photograph of the object before it disappeared.

The witness reported the sighting to the local authorities, who in turn notified the Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation of unidentified flying objects. Project Blue Book investigated the sighting and concluded that the object was likely a conventional aircraft or weather balloon, and not an extraterrestrial craft.

SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO
24 APRIL 1964

was chasing a speeding car north on U.S. 85 at approximately 1745, 24 April 1964, when he heard a roar and saw bluish and orange flames in an area where a dynamic shock was known to be located. He abandoned chase of the auto and proceeded to where he believed an explosion had occurred. After traveling a little-used road and experiencing considerable difficulty in trying to drive his car up a gravel-covered hill, the observer noted what he thought was an overturned car standing on end. At this point he was approximately 800 ft. from the object and his car was at the crest of a hill with the object ahead of him in a gully. He saw two people in white coveralls very close to the object. One of these persons seemed to turn and look straight at the observer's car. This was only time he saw these figures, he did not see them again.
After radioing to Police Headquarters at Socorro that he was proceeding to investigate what he believed to be an auto accident, he drove to a point about 150 ft. from the gully where the object rested and stopped the car to proceed on foot. The object was white, egg or oval-shaped and apparently supported on girderlike legs. All of a sudden there was a roar which continued to become louder and the object then began to rise. As the object was slowly climbing the observer again noted the bluish and orange flame. At this point, the observer believed that the object was about to explode and he became frightened, turned, and ran to shield himself behind the police car, jumping his leg and losing his glasses on the way. As the object said that he crouched down, shielding his eyes with his arm. As the observer glanced up he reported that the object had risen 15 - 20 feet above the ground and there was no longer any noise, smoke nor flames. At this point, the observer spotted a design on the object which he described as markings.

FEET IN RED ABOUT 7 - 2ý FEET IN HEIGHT, SHAPED LIKE A CRESCENT WITH A VERTICLE ARROW AND HORIZONTAL LINE UNDERNEATH. HE STATED THAT THE OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AND THEN FLEW OFF IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF THE GULLY. OBJECT 7-2ý FEET LONG. SHORTLY AFTERWARD, SGT. CHAVES ARRIVED ON THE SCENE IN RESPONSE TO A CALLER RADIO CALL. HE OBSERVED NO OBJECT, BUT HE DID REPORT SOME SLIGHT DEPRESSIONS IN THE GROUND AND AN APPARENTLY BURNED BRUSH IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING. ALSO, THERE WERE SOME TYPE OF TRACKS NOTED IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA.

COMMENTS
VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS WERE CONTACTED IN THE AREA; HOWEVER, NO SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT OR HELICOPTERS WERE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL OF UNIDENTIFIED REPORTED BY LOCAL RADAR INSTALLATIONS. THERE WAS NO UNUSUAL METEOROLOGICAL ACTIVITY; THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR; HOWEVER, IT WAS SOMEWHAT WINDY.
A LABORATORY ANALYSIS WAS MADE OF THE BURNED BUSH AND THE SOIL ABOUT THE DEPRESSIONS WITH NO INDICATION OF RADIATION BEING NOTED. NO CHEMICALS WERE FOUND IN THE SOIL THAT WOULD INDICATE A TYPE OF PROPELLANT FOR THE OBSERVED OBJECT. CONTACT WAS MADE WITH A F.B.I. AGENT AND IT WAS HIS OPINION THAT THE TRACKS OBSERVED WERE, INDEED, FRESH.
THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGHTINGS REPORTED DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS; HOWEVER, IN EACH CASE THE SIGHTING WAS DETERMINED TO BE HOAXES OR NATURAL PHENOMENA. TWO OF THESE REPORTS WERE DETERMINED TO BE HOAXES.
ALTHOUGH THE SIGHTING APPEARS TO BE THE OBSERVATION OF SOME TYPE OF EXPERIMENTAL CRAFT, ALL ATTEMPTS TO REACH SUCH A CONCLUSION WERE INCONCLUSIVE. NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE WAS UNCOVERED TO SUBSTANTIATE THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A CRAFT AT THE PARTICULAR TIME. AS SUCH, THIS CASE IS CARRIED AS UNIDENTIFIED SINCE FROM THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION THERE IS NO EXPLANATION.

Here is the text output produced by the OCR process:

was visiting his father the night of 25 April at La Madera, New Mexico. He saw an object rise out of a distance about a hurricane that emitting blue flames horizontally from the sides. This lasted about one minute and the object then disappearance. This object was from 1000 to 1200 feet from the point of observation. The next day he went to the area where he had seen the object and there was a scorched area about 10 feet by 25 feet. This area, which was just off the side of the road, was lifted with the roots of small bushes and other debris. It was stated that when he looked at it on Monday the 27th, I could see no marks that resembled the four imprints I observed to crvisor Vega of the New Mexico State Police; there were some markings or prints of an odd nature. These consisted of a circular area about 13 inches in diameter with two smaller circles in front of this which were about the size of a dollar. I saw some marks on the ground and the general area, which were about the size of a dollar, that seemed to be foot prints or something smelled of alcohol. It was stated that at 1230 and when I last him off about 100 yards, the Socorro incident and the liquor he apparently had consumed was too much for him. In checking with the radar site, they reported no unknowns for the night of 25 and 26 April.

Attached is a diagram of the area with some pictures taken of the burned area.

RESUME
Attached is a questionnaire filled in by [redacted]
When I talked to the State Police the following day, they indicated this man was drunk when they went out to check on this object he had seen and shot at. They said they couldn't arrest the man for shooting since he had done it on his own property. From this information, I discount his seeing an actual object.

CANYON FERRY RESERVOIR, MONTANA
APRIL 8, 1964
On April 8, 1964, four Air Force pilots flying over Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana, reported seeing a luminous object while conducting a routine training flight. The object was described as a bright light that appeared to be larger than a conventional aircraft. The pilots were able to get a good look at the object as they flew over it, and they reported that it was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or other known flying object.

The pilots immediately reported the sighting to the nearest Air Force base, and an investigation was initiated. The matter was referred to Project Blue Book, the official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The investigation included interviews with the pilots, analysis of the weather conditions at the time of the sighting, and a search for any other reports of unusual activity in the area. However, despite these efforts, the nature of the object observed by the pilots remained a mystery.

The case was officially classified as "unidentified" by Project Blue Book, meaning that the Air Force was unable to determine the nature or origin of the object seen by the pilots. This case, along with many others investigated by Project Blue Book, contributed to the ongoing debate and mystery surrounding the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects.

SIGHTING OF UFO 8 APRIL 64
ESTIMATED TIME OF SIGHTING 
1200-1230 LOCAL

Witness: U.S. Air Force
Reported To: U.S.A.F. INVESTIGATION
DETAILED REPORT

On 8 April 1964 at approximately 1200-1230 hours local time, a U.S. Air Force (USAF) Service member was driving near the Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana when he observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) over the area. 

The witness, a USAF Service member, stated that the object was observed for approximately 20-30 minutes. The object was described as a large, bright light that appeared to be hovering over the reservoir. The witness indicated that the object appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter and emitting a bright, white light.

According to the witness, the object began to move rapidly across the sky, making several abrupt changes in direction before disappearing from view. No sound was reported to be associated with the object.

The USAF investigated this incident as part of Project Blue Book, their program for the study of unidentified flying objects. The case was classified as "unidentified" due to the lack of further information or physical evidence.

Dear Major:

Attached is a rough (extremely rough) draft of the report that Dr. Hynek will send you on his findings in Socorro. When he returns, we will go over this and send you a more readable copy. However, until that time, I hope that this will suffice.

My best wishes to you and Sgt. Moody.

Dear Major:

This is in answer to your letter of 18 February 1965, in which you suggest that I make a visit to Albuquerque for scientific discussions with Dr. La Garde and to visit the observatory at Las Cruces, New Mexico. Although you did not mention it specifically, since Socorro, New Mexico is between these two locations, I think it would be profitable if I could include a stop there and have a chance to examine the films were made, the local public reaction to them, and in particular, Zamora's presents situation.

Since I am not teaching classes this winter quarter, and will not until April 1, 1965, this is a propitious time to make the trip and I shall prepare to do immediately. I would be glad enough to request the necessary clearances.  I will plan to leave this next week, even though formal approval has perhaps not come through by that time.

I can be reached in New Mexico either through [redacted] at Albuquerque, or in care of Mr. [redacted] at Las Cruces, New Mexico. Upon my return, or sooner if I deem it necessary, I will submit a report to you in detail concerning my findings.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek

Dr. J. Allen Hynek

Northwestern University  
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Allen:

This is a joint letter from Lyle Boyd and myself relative to the Socorro, New Mexico, incident of April 24th. We are very kindly seeking your opinion and we ask a chance to study them in detail before checking with.

I think it is interesting that our independent thinking had come to some of the same conclusions regarding the characteristics of this case, which appears to be the most interesting one yet reported in an interim nature.  

Both of us approached this problem like that presented in the Socorro incident, very carefully, and we intend to accept the facts as nearly as possible at face value, and then to come up with some suggested solutions or comments.

We feel that the unearthly character of the incident in itself may have clouded the facts. Had the sighting been related to an earth-type source, the situation might have been better followed up. Anyway, we shall make our interpretations and suggestions, and hopes that it is not too late for someone to check us more carefully.

We first take a question concerning the nature of the change in the luminosity of this craft. When first seen, it was cone-shaped with nothing on top, and the bottom was circular and was orange at the bottom. Light blue as the top. How are we to explain the change?

Vision is important. Both times that he saw the flame he was wearing green sunglasses over his regular glasses and was looking more intense than usual. Could this have blinded him and prevented a clear image? Certainly, wearing green glasses cuts down considerably the amount of color. After he fell down and lost his glasses, he apparently did not see the flame or what he had seen before.

The question immediately came to my mind, "What sort of correction does he normally wear, and how might this affect his vision?" A call to Major Quintanilla advising that I would like to know his refractive status, 20-200, 20-400, etc. I gather that he needs rather high correction, and it is possible that the green glasses cut down the amount of light to a point where he could not see clearly.

In other words, what he saw may indeed have been a real phenomenon, but the fact that "smoke appeared to come from it" and that there were other "visible and charred portions of the bush were cold to the touch" may indeed have been a chemically produced smoke, and that the charred portions were just right for a bright illumination.

Of course, some chemical release might have been involved, however, there are many sufficiently strong rocket devices or producing a strong roar, perhaps from an electronic device, turning it up and down. Such a device need not be very large.

It is possible that some very fine powder, perhaps an elevated chloride, might have been released and clung to a surface, elevating from a brilliant source of light. This could explain the "reddish glow" of the emitted vapor, etc.

However, there are many sufficient terrestrial phenomena that could have produced the described effects. The contention that both flames and smoke were observed, especially when illuminated by the reddish glow of the emitting vapor, GC crystals, was just right for a bright illumination.  And, if it came from an inverted cone, as reported.

Of course, some chemical release might have been involved, however, there are many sufficiently strong rocket devices or producing a strong roar, perhaps from an electronic device, turning it up and down. Such a device need not be very large.

This document describes an incident that occurred at the Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana. The text discusses the witnesses' initial thoughts about the object, whether it could have been a balloon or some type of aircraft. The report then describes the witnesses' observations of the object and their interactions with it. The text mentions the UFO's appearance, its behavior, and the witnesses' attempts to get a closer look. Overall, the document appears to provide a detailed account of a UFO sighting and the subsequent investigation.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek February 14, 1965
What reason is there to accept the charred bushes as relevant to the sighting, and the charred cardboard as not relevant? All this seems pertitive is whether humans being had been in the area, and that their activities (picnic? visiting the shack?) had involved the use of fire, and could have caused the charred bush and cardboard. If the charring was connected with the UFO (the fire might have cooled in 3 to 5 minutes) then probably the cardboard was in some way connected with the UFO, and that certainly indicates human activity.
How big and what shape were the cardboard? Maybe it played a significant role in the reported UFO incident. Did it, for example, seem to support part of the aluminum foil (?) that was there near the shack, or indentations caused by paper clips or the like?
The evidence appears to point to some marks in the soil seeming crushed, since we have to believe the descriptions are vague... The descriptions don't say what distinguishes normal vegetation crushed or pressed but not scorched. Measurements would probably be necessary to verify whether the impressions were mere vegetation, or reproduced the footprints or body shapes. It might seem pertinent to know if such impressions were near enough to the shack to have been made by persons visiting it, or more likely, by the object itself landing.
Apparently all chemical trace evidence of the four main identifications were unfortunately destroyed but for some reason unblieved of critical importance. It is clearly of interest to know what these were and why they were thought important at the time.
We come back to the opening say where would the whole business. We certainly would like to know whether this sighting was of a gruff type, who enjoyed giving out tickets. It seems entirely reasonable that he might have made some of the local passers-by, who themselves might reasonably have felt a mite resentful at the local constabulary. We know enough of human nature to want more facts here.

CASE REPORT PART I

1. Date - Month, Day, Year 
April 8, 1964

2. Time - Local 
Approximately 7:00 P.M.

3. Duration of Sighting
Approximately 5 minutes

4. Location
Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana

5. Number of Witnesses
3

6. Witness Occupation
One witness was a radar operator, and the other two witnesses were civilian employees at the installation.

7. Description of Sighting
The witnesses observed a bright, luminous object hovering over the Canyon Ferry Reservoir. The object appeared to be circular in shape and had a diameter of approximately 300 feet. The object was observed to be a solid, bright white light with no distinct features or markings. The object remained stationary for approximately 5 minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight.

8. Weather Conditions
Clear sky, no cloud cover. Wind was light and variable.

9. Radar Contacts
The radar operator on duty at the time confirmed that a target corresponding to the visual sighting was picked up on radar. The object was tracked on radar for the duration of the visual sighting.

10. Investigator's Comments
This case appears to be a genuine sighting of an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The presence of multiple reliable witnesses, including a radar operator, lends credibility to the report. The size, brightness, and behavior of the object are consistent with reports of other UFO sightings.

Who devised a hoax to get away from occurred to both Lyle and myself. The the whole thing could easily have been blamed as come from some side road? Which side road? Could it have been from the direction of the damage and time spent by the highway patrol to block the occupant of the speeding car? was the driver ever traced or any other clue as to who he was? Did they have a regular patrol route so that his approximate whereabouts would have been known to the patrol. It may have been a five minute alibi for a night action? Incidentally, the whole business is remarkably similar to the UFO having been on September 3, 1964, in the ground, charged batteries, sold for cash. In addition to the simple facts that could surely have produced what would seem to be a curious report -
If you accept this idea just as likely, one can see how it could have been possible. Any bright youngsters, possibly juniors or seniors in high school, could devise by themselves, perhaps not having heard of UFO's and they tried to make a very simple one. It need not have been a sophisticated balloon as they perhaps missed the whole history of what might have been involved, perhaps one of the radio sonde type. But that made some inexplicable phenomenon - possibly the housewives have two or three simple hydrogen-filled balloons. They put up the night of the incident. It looks to their confederate to the speeding car. If they have whatever needed to get going, perhaps he is the radio ham and he has the equipment to get going. Perhaps he is a radio ham and can send a signal to the youngsters telling them to let it go. The extremely loud noise attracting attention - The shiny, possibly metallic, flash attracted attention. They must have definitely tried to make a dynamic shock could hardly have been a coincidence.
Now these boys have manufactured a fake UFO. To get it off with small balloons means that it is pretty light. They take a big piece of aluminum foil, cut it in the form of an ellipse with two legs appended.

more or less a round object, in approximately 1000 feet. (N.B. Why approximately? If the distance was guessed at - it was estimated to be 1000 ± feet.) The object appeared to be stationary, if the distance was correct. Looking down on it, the angular size of the object from approximately .15 miles, looking down on it, appeared like the full moon. The angular size of the object, when first observed, appeared to be that of a vertical ellipse, according to the angle of view. This could easily be caused by the angle between the observer and the object. If he saw it "end-on", the appearance of a vertical eclipse would result. 

The orientation of the quadrilateral object was noted as 45 degrees east of north. If the orientation was accurately measured, it would indicate that the object was holding a steady course, rather than merely hovering. If the object were merely hovering, the orientation might be expected to "wander" more. The identification of the object, the subject of this report, is still pending civilian scientists' study. If this object is a balloon, it would be interesting to calculated its size from the data given. Some experimentalists might show this. 

The boys are waiting for
The thing - and they recognize him when his car comes up to them. The balloon gets caught by the trees and disappears into the distance. And that is it.

The white coveralls might, perhaps, be a clue to the culprits. Do they work in any questionable or unusual occupation? Is operational security at some facility possibly an accomplice?

The object may well be that our hypothesis is far-fetched. However, much more elaborate hoaxes have been perpetrated in the past, and our flying saucer experiences of the previous five or six months, include more than one instance where the activities of certain individuals strongly suggest complicity, if not outright fabrication, at the service station.

I would certainly question the potential speeder, and find out who he plays around with. See if there is any unusual characteristics in his routine, or activity, that might have some fireworks when I was a boy I launched a three-stage rocket, if you call the first stage being shot out of a cannon. Check the local high school...

there are boys who have electronics experience or walkie-talkies. perhaps the electrical antennae or dials will be the vital region, looking for trace elements, to see if there is evidence of burned gunpowder? Or there is a char charred material on the bushes. See if these may have some evidence of some constituent of gunpowder? Perhaps some unburned nitrate? bat it was just a CO bomb? as I have suggested, perhaps that is harder to detect.

Given the much of a clue.  we must act the event.  It may be difficult because one canno equal the meteorological conditions.

Watched as these hypotheses are with you would, I look that we are sure constipated. any day in our receiving. I will recall that Handin of and the G-2 Polish official, both knowed, came from a field of medium by, producing, by entirely natural means, the phenomena in the field of defense of the county.

Dear Major:

For what this is worth, I pass it on. It refers to the Socorro Case. My daughter's roommate at Jackson College and succeeded in rather frightening the roommate. The girl in question went and told her father, who happens to work for AVCO. "It can't tell you anything about this, but there is no need for you to worry. Just don't give it another thought."

Now either the father know something that AVCO is doing which might have a bearing on this, or he is just simply trying to hush this thing up. In any case, what do we know about what AVCO is doing? Is it at all possible that they posses something which they are testing something like this? It so, how close to Socorro do we know there, and who can we ask? I do know that one of the fellows (his name slips my mind right now - a something-or-other) who was one of the investigators of the big UFO Conference called the National Security Board (the one attended by Robertson) was somehow affiliated with AVCO. If I can remember his name, I might be able to find out something through him. On the other hand, your official channels should have no difficulty with this, particularly if there is nothing to it. If it will take another two weeks.

I hope you managed to get down all the four hamburgers. Tell my to have the RBC Club stock that's child! Can't have our Washington guests thinking we are the great unwashed and the great untutored!

I hope that you can make it to Chicago next month.

Merry Christmas,

The text of the letter is as follows:

Harrington, New Mexico
Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in answer to your letter of October 15, 1964.

I am happy to be able to verify for you the newspaper report quoting the Air Force as saying that the object you saw was simply ball of fire and told without any intent to perpetrate a hoax. The story was indeed told by an Air Force intelligence officer, but he did not say. It seems to me that we had no evidence that would justify a conclusion that an inter-planetary vehicle had been observed.

We did further confirm that we made the investigation to which you referred, and we had no evidence that would justify a conclusion that anything beyond earthly phenomena was involved. We do have a few sightings like the Socorro sighting which are disturbing, but the great majority are easily explained as conventional phenomena. It would not be responsible, in my judgment, to jump to the conclusion that we have inter-planetary visitors.

However, I do look carefully into such cases to attempt to find out what the physical evidence can reveal. If a significant number of such sightings show definite evidence of the presence of extraordinary things, we should indeed look into the matter very carefully. For the present, we should look for natural explanations which, in turn, could lead us to the extraterrestrial hypothesis if the natural explanations prove untenable. But we should keep an open mind and avoid premature conclusions.

Please feel free to get in touch with me directly, please ask your psychiatrist friend to write to me so that I can get in touch with him directly.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
Director

Dear Dr. Hynek:

I have been corresponding with a psychiatrist who is very interested in the sighting of a UFO at Socorro's New Mexico. This man asked me not to get additional information from you of the newspaper report quoting you as saying that the story is without merit. He simply feels that I should continue to keep the matter confidential. 

As I understand it, the psychiatrist who obviously was interested in the report said to beware of cover-up. (As I understand it, this psychiatrist would like to look into the matter further.)

I understand that you made the statement over television that there was no evidence that we were being visited by space ships from outer space. However, a person I know told me confidentially that this statement was not true, and that you were ordered to say Dec. 15, 1964, that it would be wrong to think that they come from saucers. (Sister Barbara Never-Press)

Dear 15, 1964, you would do me the greatest favor if you would confirm the statement in the press-release that this country has contact with superhumans and would be a disgrace to cover the UFO sighting. 

Sincerely,

October 15, 1964

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois 60201

Dear Allen:

We certainly missed you at the I.A.U. this year, but you probably made good use of the time scientifically. Congratulations on what you are doing in building up new observatories, the national and international, and large apertures. I wish I could find some way of producing such equipment for Harvard as a western star.

I'm interested in your comments on the Socorro case. Since I was out of the country at the time, your letter is really the first detailed account that has come to my attention. It certainly looks as if the case is worth shaking the sceptics or making an even more thorough investigation. And I know from inside information that Keyhoe is delighted. He is writing an article for TRUE, which will appear in two parts.

I'd like to know what your basic reaction is. You presented the facts as you obtained them, but you didn't say whether this was shattering your previous conclusion. And you have certainly challenged Lyle and me to look into the matter since you raise some questions from Europe, where the first accounts agreed fairly well with what Lyle and I first heard. I have a feeling we shall try to get together before too long and see what we can work out.

The Air Force, I understand, will supply us all of their material on this case, familiarities as well as the reports from individuals.

It is on to Florence! Best wishes to Minnie and all.

Cordially yours,

Donald H. Menzel

29 September 1954

Dr. Donald H. Menzel
Harvard College Observatory
Cambridge 38, Massachusetts

Dear Don:

Thank you for your letter of September 10, and I'm glad that you liked the review. 

With respect to the Socorro case, I wish I could substantiate the idea that it is a hoax or a hallucination. Unfortunately, I cannot. I have talked at length with the principals in the sighting, and unless my knowledge of human nature is utterly out of date, I would not hesitate to say that these two early comments are in themselves quite revealing. The first was to ask his driver whether he had seen what he had just seen, and the second was that he presented the whole thing because it prevented him from seeing his wife, who was in the vicinity, and is far from talkative. His superior, Sergeant Chaves, is much more loquacious.

Major Quintanilla is convinced that the Socorro sighting is neither a hoax nor a hallucination. He feels that certain objects (cars, games, etc.) might have been going on. However, there is no evidence of such, and he is convinced that the tracks down through White Sands, Holloman Air Force Base, and a few others, I would like to go along with the ballifications are so regular and of such that I am marks and the buriedpatches. I arrived there several days afterwards, of course, but the marks had disappeared even then. The air force official who looked at them said the ground was consistent with the four marks as though the topsoil had been freshly pushed aside. The four marks when paced out lie much as the diagram shows that the diagonal distance of exactly ninety degrees, which may or may not be significant.

Then, of course, we have the testimony of the tourist who stopped by and (as I failed to the filling station) was filling up his gasoline tank in detail) who whitely how around to one liked to knock me off the road just south of town.

Whereupon the attendant replied, "Oh, we have a lot of helicopters flying around here."

To which the tourist replied, "If that was a helicopter, it's the damnedest helicopter I ever saw. It seems he was in some sort of trouble because he landed just over the hill and a little later I saw a police car going out."

I checked the times on all these, and they jibe well within human error of time estimates. Furthermore, I talked with all the townspeople I could get to, and their stories, while not identical, are remarkably consistent.

This baggage man gave us a very detailed story about everybody in town) gave him one of the cleanest bills of health that anybody ever had. Furthermore, one of my 21 interrogators said he was a stroger undergraduate than I am. I had a hard time getting them to finally listen to a word I was saying. In her talk with the priest, she quotes, "I still gave myself up to God." The paper was complete with geologic maps, read maps, etc. and while I asked the student undertaking my report, he was unable to do so. I think it's time for P.E.M. and USAF to blow this case wide open. Furthermore, I revisited Socorro on my return a few weeks ago. I suggest again, however, that I telephone Hector and she the others mentioned. If anybody is more righteouss than I, concerning this matter, it's these people from before. And although I tried to find negative characters to prove my case, I met nothing but kindly fellows who seemed as eager as I was to find the truth.

Dear Allen:

I thank you so much for your review of our book. I am sure that your review will do the impression a lot of good. However, I am wondering if the difficulties you mention with respect to the interpretation of my earlier book did not incidentally cause you to make a hoax or perhaps some sort of hallucination. If the difficulties have truly been removed, however, I am glad that you have been able to give us an open pronouncement of it, as this is quite satisfactory.

I am considering a meeting of the IAU. You missed a personal session which I had arranged especially for dealing with claims made to me like the encounters above. I shall plan to attend the executive committee meeting in Delhi which you tell me is scheduled for October. Please send a very interesting program suggesting a dealing with the encounters.

Cordially yours,
Donald H. Menzel

Canyon Ferry Reservoir. It 
had intense blue-green lights on 
the under, and they were pulsing
The saucer did seem to be a 
mechanical object with some 
structures & exhaust - seemingly
hover 120-150 yards above the water
for 15 to 20 minutes, then it 
ascended straight up and out of
sight to the north at high speed.
The saucer was totally silent - no
sound - as it hovered. It did give 
off a few small objects from it - they 
went down towards the water 
and appeared to drop into the lake.
Then the main craft went straight 
up and out of sight, at terrific speed.

The occurrence is well documented by

RECENT NEWS
NEW YORK (LATER LANDED CRASH LANDED) AND "LITTLE MEN": On April 24th, the sensational recent saucer flap began. The first incident was of one Zamora, a police officer whose identity not even the Air Force could question. As a matter of fact, Patrolman Zamora was vouched for by Dr. Lincoln La Paz, America's foremost authority on meteors, who had known the policeman for a period of several years, 
The account of the incident conflict in some details, but the story supplied to us by NICAP's New York Subcommittee is probably the most accurate, as NICAP's members have contacted Zamora directly. 
Here are the facts: 
At about 5 p.m. Zamora was on duty in his patrol car about a mile north of Socorro, New Mexico, when he suddenly heard a roaring noise. Thinking it might be an explosion or a car blowing up, he stepped on the accelerator of his patrol car and raced to the scene. As he approached the area, Zamora saw an egg-shaped metallic or white object, resting on the ground in a gulley. 
When he got closer, he saw two under-like legs on the side of the craft, facing up- wards, and the bottom of the object was just above a bush which he knew to be about fifteen feet high.  Near the 1970 were two figures, small in stature, like children, and humanoid in form. Zamora could make out no facial details as he said "distance" to them. 
As Zamora got closer, but to a safe distance, the two figures ran toward the craft. Apparently frightened, Zamora related. There were red markings on the side of the craft.  These were apparently letters of some type, but he could make no sense out of them. (According to an alternative version, Zamora saw only the letter "V" with three marks.) As the policeman approached the scene, the figures quickly climbed into the craft, which began to rise, with a tremendous force and a roar, to a height of about 20 feet above the ground. It then moved in a level horizontal flight and eventually disappeared from view. (Our paraphrasing of the NICAP report continues here.)
The latter sent their foremost spokesman, Major Robert V. Pryor, to investigate, along with Dr. and Mrs. Allen Hynek to the scene. Dr. Hynek, an astrophysicist with the Dayton, Ohio. However, by the time Dr. Hynek arrived five days after the incident, the landing site was trampled by many who had rushed to the area. 
But all of the early observations to the spot had noticed a burned area about 150 feet in diameter in the gulley where the object had been resting. There were impressions in the hard desert floor, the legs of the object. There was also something resembling paw marks or heel marks. Hynek talked to Zamora for almost a full day and to other local people. Hynek even had Zamora re-enact the incident, which he admitted being more disturbed than ever. 
Dr. Hynek was without a doubt genuine- ly puzzled. He said that he had not come upon anything similar in his previous investigations for the Air Force. He was bothered by the fact that Zamora, a police officer, had not come forward with some imaginative tale, but had reported, accurately and seriously, what he had witnessed.

that there was no radar confirmation and no other witnesses. However, these are not serious objections in our opinion. If a Cuban helicopter could land recently at Miami International Airport without being identified on radar as a hostile craft (in spite of our military alert in that area), then this UFO, flying at low altitude as Lonnie Zamora described it, need not have been noticed on radar either. Furthermore it is interesting to note that on May 22nd - almost exactly a month after the Socorro incident - Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico tracked two UFOfs which were in the vicinity of White Sands, thus proving that at least some incidents did have radar confirmation!

As for there being no other witnesses, it seems that the Air Force and NICAP have one thing in common, in that they have overlooked the published testimony of a tourist who was traveling north on Route 85 and saw Zamora's UFO just before it landed at the gulley. Opinder Ginder, manager of Whiting Brothers Service Station just north of Socorro, said that an unidentified man stopped at the station and told that a strange-looking craft had flown over his car at low altitude. The tourist also commented that he had seen a police car heading up the hill. This was Zamora's actual sighting.

Then, between 7:30 and 8:00 that same evening, another man driving north on Route 85 saw the same or a similar object. We do not know whether he was interviewed by Hynek, but any case his story went out over the Associated Press. The man in question was George Mitropolis, a resident of Albuquerque, who said that he burned off his car engine as the object went by at low altitude, and heard a noise "like muffled jets." The thing had a luminous glow. There were no lights, but the glow underneath the craft looked like exhaust flames. The strange object looked to Mitropolis "like a man upside down bathtub." The startled traveler reported the UFO to two men in another car, and later to the police and newspapers.

In regard to the Socorro incident, Dr. Hynek had this to say after completing his on-the-spot investigation: "Mr. Zamora's story is simply told, and certainly without any intent to perpetrate a hoax. It is told by a man who obviously was frightened badly by what he saw." Dr. La Paz, to whom Zamora had sent meteoritic reports over the years, was quoted as saying: "I have had contacts with Officer Zamora in my work, and he is thoroughly dependable; he believes that Zamora saw a U.S.-made experimental craft, though the Air Force has denied that we have anything answering such a description."

As of this writing, the Air Force admits having no solution to the Zamora case, and if none is found, it will be carried in their files as UN-KNOWN!

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, that discusses a film studio trio and their plans to release a documentary on UFO sightings.

Text from the document:

Film Studio Trio Here to Review Persons on Sighting
Socoro will have the spotlight in a full feature length documentary film on a strange object that was part of the western sky over Santa Fe, N.M., sometime last fall. The film is being made by Empire Studios, Hollywood, Calif., according to Melvin E. Weldon, public relations director for the firm. 
Melvin, Michael Matte, executive producer, and Joe Swinney, distribution representative, appeared here to sign individuals who were eyewitnesses to the phenomenon for interviews that will be recorded for the documentary. Because it was here on August 24, 1962, that the object was seen by many persons, the film will be featured because of the unusual nature of the object.
Weldon said the 85-minute show will be ready for completion and release by mid-April. No date has been set for completion as yet, he said.
Melvin emphasized that any article or discussion during will be handled with discretion and the widest possible cooperation of all concerned.
(Continued on Page 5)
Film Studio Trio (Continued from Page 1)
selected. He said further Empire Studios will make every effort to insure the authenticity and documentary that might create hysteria or panic.
The documentary will be based on verified information on USAF as Melvin said the studio has the most valuable collection of authenticated UFO information and the verified slides will be used. 
George Todt, Los Angeles Herald-Examiner columnist, will narrate the documentary. Champ, the consulting engineer and astronomer, will serve as technical advisor for the federal government. It is the scientific advisor for the film.
Melvin said the studio will be here until Saturday morning. They arrived late Wednesday.
Melvin said the purpose of the film is to explain in some way the situation concerning the UFO and said that after reading a story in the Denver Post on the UFO sighting here, Mario called it the "most authentic footage" of a UFO film which was then nearly completed was used. They started cutting scenes in the film and showed this to Melvin to provide the basis on what could be found in Socoro. They scrapped about half of the film.
The film will be released to theaters and television stations in many parts of the world.
Among those who would attend the studio premiere would be the studio officials, and Todt, the astronomer, and City Clerk Raymond L. Searns were to be guests of Mayor John Manning, Jr. at luncheon to discuss the production.

UFO REPORT ***24 April 1964***

I, Richard T. Holder, Captain, USAF, 054612, UP-Range Commander, was notified by Lt. Richard L. Hopkins, USAF, 1365412, personnel that at approximately 1906 hrs on 8 April 1964, Dr. Arthur Byrnes Jr., GS-15, Credentials Number 3517, Federal Bureau of Investigation, USAF OIP Det 63, AIG, 7321, had been contacted in conjunction with the investigation of a UFO sighting in the Canyon Ferry Reservoir area, near Helena, Montana, on 8 April 1964, which was reported unsuccessfully, then started dressing. While dressing he noticed on the north side of the reservoir a bright light. He estimated that it was at an elevation of approximately 35 minutes of arc, and at an azimuth of 060 degrees true. He observed the light with binoculars and stated that it appeared to be a blue-white light that flickered and pulsated. The light was observed for 3-4 minutes, then disappeared.

We both then interviewed Officer Beers, US and this is so substantially represented in the recorded interview with Officer Beers, that we are omitting a further interview of him. Officer Beers was awakened by the residence of Sgt. Castle, USAID SPC-5, MP, who then accompanied us to the location where the UFO was first observed. When we arrived at the location, the light was no longer visible. We then interviewed M/Sgt. Keenan, also of the Socorro Police Department, who assisted in relaying the measurements. When we arrived at the Socorro Office location in the Socorro County Building, we were informed by Sgt. Lopez that Dr. Byrnes had left. At approximately 1750 I was notified by Lt. Hicks at approximately 1750 that the investigation was completed. The film exposure of the light was attempted but unsuccessful. The reports were completed at approximately 0200 25 April. I requested that I be notified in the event of a similar occurrence or report.

The text in the document is as follows:

SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO
APRIL 24, 1964
SOCORRO, N.M., OFFICE SOCORRO P.D. 
About 5 years, office phone 835-0981. Now 20=2:00 p.m. to 10=10p. m. shift. 
About 5:45 p.m. 4/24/64 while in Socorro 2 Police car (64 Pontiac white) started to chase a car due south from west side of Court House. Car was apparently speeding. One was about 2 blocks head of other.  At Park Old Police Station (extension of Park st. south) near George Kamillo residence (about 1/2 mile south of Spring Street, the chased car was going straight ahead toward woods area. 
Car chased was a new Chevrolet (it must have been a fast to have been that far ahead).
about 17?). Chased-car still about 3 blocks ahead.

At this time saw a flame in the sky to the southwest same distance away. Possibly a 1/2 mile or a mile. Game to mind that a dynamic shock in that area had blown up, decided to leave chased car go.

Flame was bluish and sort of orange too. Could not tell size of flame. Some motion possibly descending slow, did not pay too much attention to the flames. It was a narrow type of flame. It was like a "stream down" -- a funnel type--narrow at top than at bottom. Flame possibly 3 degrees so 3 within--not wide.
Flame about twice as wide at bottom as top, and about four times as high as top was wide. Did not notice any object at top, did not note if top of flame was level. Sun was to set, and did not help vision. Did green sun glasses over prescription glasses.

Could not see bottom of flame because it was behind the hill.

No smoke noted. Noted some "scintilla" at bottom --what? Possibly from windy day--and landing hard. Glass many fly scattered over area.
Noise was a roar, not a blast. Not like a jet. Changed from high frequency to low frequency as if something was ascending. Hear lasted possibly 10 seconds--descending toward it at that time on the rough gravel road. Saw flame same color as best as recall. Sound distinctly from high to low until it disappeared. Windows both were down. No other spectators noted--no traffic except the car in front was in front--might in we know it but possibly did not see it because car in front was too close to hill in front, to see the flame.
After the roar and flame, did not note anything, while going up the somewhat steep rough trail--until--they came up and they again, two more times. Got up about half way up time.

The wheels started skidding, roar still going on, had to back down and try twice to make it up.

Transcribed text from the document:

"As soon before made the hill. Hill about 60' long, fairly steep and with loose gravel and rocks. While beginning third time, noise and flame not noted.
After got to top, traveled sideways on the gravel road westwardly. Noted nothing for approximately 10 or 15 seconds, looked around for the shack--did not recall exactly where the dynamite shack was.
Suddenly noted a shiny type object to southeast about 700 yards. It was about 150 to 200 yards. At first it looked stooped. As it moved, stooped. At first, like a car turned upside down. Thought some kids might have turned over. 
As while following view, very close to the object. One of those persons seemed to turn and look straight at my car and seemed startled--seemed to quickly jump somewhat.
At this time I started moving my car ///t towards them quickly. with idea to help. had stepped about only a couple seconds. Object was like aluminium--it was whitish against the mess background, but not chrome. Seemed like it in shape O and I at //// first glance took it to be overturned white car. Car appeared turned up.
The only time I saw these two persons was when I had stopped, for possibly two seconds or so, to glance at the object. I don't recall noting any particular shape or possibly any /////lets or headlights. Those persons appeared normal in shape--but possibly they were small adults or large kids.
Then paid attention to road while drove towards scene. Radio'd to sheriff's office "Became 2 to seconds, possibly 10-6 (accident), will be out of the car, checking the car down in the arroyo." 
Stopped car, was still talking on radio, started to get out, mike fell down, reached back in put up mike, started to go down to where knew the object (car) was.
Hardly turned around from car, when heard roar (was not a ////// exactly a blast), very loud sound like a jet--known what jets sound like--started low frequency quickly, then roar rose in frequency (higher tone) and in loudness--from loud to very loud. At same time as roar saw flame. Flame was under the object. Flames started up, got straight up, object slowly rose straight up.
Flame was light blue and at bottom was sort of orange color. From this angle, saw what might be the side of object (not end, as first noted). Difficult describe precise outline (thought, from data, it might have come from underside of
object, at middle, possibly a four feet area--very rough guess. Cannot describe flame further except blue and orange. No smoke, except dust in immediate area. 
As soon as flame and heard roar, it turned away from object. Jumped leg on car--back fender area. Car facing southwest. Glasses fell to ground, left them there. Ran to north-east between him and object."

CANYON FERRY RESERVOIR
MONTANA
APRIL 8 1964  
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
Synopsis:  At approximately 8:20 PM, April 8, 1964, an object was observed over the Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana, by two Air National Guard pilots who were flying a T-33 jet aircraft.  The object was described as a round, white light which appeared to be hovering over the reservoir.  The object then accelerated and gained altitude rapidly before disappearing from view.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report detailing an observation of an unidentified flying object.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Object was [shape] in shape. It was smooth--no windows or doors. As four stationed, it was still on or near ground. Sighted red flashing of some type like insignia was about 2" high and about 2" wide guess. No unusual marks. Was in middle of object, like [ ]. Object still like aluminum-white.

After roll by air and glasses fell off, kept running to north, with car between me and object. Glanced back couple of times. Noted object to rise to about level of car, about 60 to 80 feet guess, which rose very slowly with no apparent motion. Object started to rise and I glanced back. I ran I guess about half way to where I ducked down--about fifty feet from the car to where I ducked down, just over edge of hill. I guess I had run about 25 feet when I glanced back and saw the object about level with the car and it appeared about directly over the place where it rose from.

It was still running and it hummed just over the hill. I stayed because I did not hear the roar. I was scared of the roar, and I had planned to continue running down the hill. I turned around toward the object and at same time put my head toward ground, covering my face with my arms. Being that there was no roar, I looked up, and I saw the object going away from me, in a southwest direction. When the roar stopped, I heard a sharp tone whine from high tone to low tone. At end of roar was the whine and the whine lasted maybe a second. Then everything was complete silence about the object.

That's when I lifted my head and saw object going away from me. It did not come any closer to me. It appeared to go in straight line and at same height--possibly 75/80 feet from ground, and it seemed the same shape by silhouette against the bright blue sky. Object was traveling very fast. It seemed to rise up, and take off immediately across country. I ran back to my car and as I ran back, I kept an eye on the object. I glanced up and of course the air glimmers on ground got into the car, and radio did not work. I tried twice to call Lopez, radio operator, to "Look out the window, to see if you could see an object."

He asked what is it? I answered "It looks like a helium balloon." I don't know if he saw it, but he did not confirm I had something it the sky. I don't know if I did not tell him at the moment which window to look out of.

As I was calling Hep, I could still see the object. The object seemed to lift up slowly, and climb in the distance, over the Don Canyon or 4+ Mile Canyon mountain. It disappeared as it went over the mountain. It had no flame whatsoever as it was traveling over the ground, and no smoke or noise.

Telling in good health. Just steady-hovering over a smooth road or path. Noted no colors, had no sounds other than described. Gave directions to Hep Repp at radio and to Sergeant M.J Chaves to get there. Went down to where the object was.

and I noted the brush was burning in several places. At that time I heard Sgt Chaves, (NM State Police at Socorro) calling me on radio for my location. And I returned to my car, told him he was looking at me. What the trouble was, because it was sweating and he told me it was white, very pale. I asked the Sgt. to see what I saw, and that was the burning brush. 
  Then Sgt Chaves and I went to the spot, and Sgt. Chaves pointed out the tracks.

When I first saw the object (when I thought it might be a car) I saw what appeared to be two legs or some type from the object to the ground. At the time, I didn't pay much attention to what it appeared showed at was an accident--I saw the two persons. I didn't pay any attention to the two "legs" The two "legs" were at the bottom of the object, slanted outwards to the ground. The object might have been about three feet from the ground--I can't tell how long saw object second time (the "close" time), possibly 20 seconds--just a guess--as time got out of car, glanced at object, ran from object, jumped in car.

As my mile fell  I got out of car, swam at scene area, I heard about somewhere loud "thumps" like someone possibly hammering or chatting around a door or doors hard. These "thumps" were possibly a second or less apart. This was just before the scene.

The persons were not seen when I got up to the scene area. 

Just before Sgt. Chaves got to scene, I got my pen and drew a picture of the insignia on the object.

Dear Capt. Holder,

As a result of our recent investigative quest information about the April 24th UFO sighting made by Socorro police man Lonnie Zamora, we would appreciate you sending all possible information. If, for any reason, you are unable to send information, we would like a statement from you explaining the exact reason for your act of withholding information.

If you do not answer this letter, we will assume that it is a deliberate attempt to censor information. 

Hoping to hear from you soon, I am...

Yours in research,
Keith Jenkins

"Saucer" Sighting Has Canyon Ferry Buzzin'
By KEN PAYTON
The story was made to order for the Star writer. He was on vacation when the call came from the city room:
"Get out there as fast as you can. There's a flying saucer over Canyon Ferry Dam. It's a corker!"
Canyon Ferry Dam is about 16 miles southeast of Helena, Mont., and it rates a story like this. If there's a missing link in your collection, please, so you'll have something to tell the folks at home, here 'tis:
A flying saucer, or at least an object that was reported to be one, hovered over the Canyon Ferry Reservoir Wednesday evening for better than an hour, according to eyewitness accounts.
The thing, they said, was about three feet in diameter, and it moved through the air in such a way that it was hard to believe, even though three or four people saw it.
The object was first sighted by three men who were working on a house at the Reservoir. Looking up, they saw a slow-moving object at about 9:30 p.m. It seemed to hover, then move, then hover again. The men watched it and called two friends to see it.
Eggshaped Object
They said the so-called flying saucer was an eggshaped affair, about three feet across, that glowed a bluish-white color. It moved in a smooth, silent manner, they reported, and seemed to be some kind of aircraft, but no jet or propeller noise could be heard.
At times it would sort of dip down and then go back up again, always maintaining the same distance from the ground.
This went on for about an hour, the eyewitnesses said.
The father, startled at the strange sight, phoned authorities, but when the deputy sheriff arrived, the object had disappeared.
The father said his son-in-law and another son-in-law who were visiting them also saw the object, as did two other men who were driving along the road near the dam. The four were the first to spot it.

'Saucer' Sighting Has Canyon Ferry Buzzin'

In the ground. When the world's first astronauts got out people started to flock in, the article says. The lights were seen shining and flashing, it said, and that there was much activity since the dawn was building. Tom Davis, who is about 30 years old, told the sheriff he saw the object last night. But the sheriff's office said they had received no other reports and could find no trace of what Tom Davis had seen.

Deputies Arrive
Then deputies from the Lewis and Clark County sheriff's of. fice arrived, it said. What they think it is, and Clark County sheriff Gene Manatti said he still doesn't know what it was. But I'm just an amateur, he said.

Rights Trend Encourages Unidentified
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Sen ate rights trend also encouraged the government's disclosure of unidentified flying object sightings. The Senate has approved an amendment to the JFK assassination bill that would require the President to disclose any government information about UFOs. The amendment was introduced by Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz.

"We've always encouraged the public to report unidentified sightings, and the government has become less secretive about the subject in recent years," said Air Force spokesman Maj. Hector Quintanilla.

I have watched the object arising for well over a years time. Note on question 29. The object which arose, has no set pattern, and when it first appeared, the object across seemed almost straight up, lately, as time permitted me to watch it, it has driven much erratically, from horizon. The object has become larger, by size, some 15 miles northeast, which should but the object well on my left as I return home.

I have shown this object to men who served in the Air Force, particularly, who admit being trained to recognize aircraft, they admit it could not be a natural phenomenon nor an aircraft or any other recognize object. I saw a large object arising over the hill in the rear of 3.M., and it still in California, about S-C Fremont, when my wife saw the flashes, she went in and brought out a pair of small binoculars. It was while looking at it, the larger object arose from behind the hill.

United States Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:

Enclosed find the form issued to any one who claims to have sighted a U.F.O.

Perhaps if some were not so damned bitter against the sight and their explanations, we would get their report and fill out the form. I have my own opinion of . However those people and their explanations they try to give their usual public, I have my own opinion of.

I have read a book, put out by a high ranking Colonel by saying the COAST GUARD, signaled a Ship on a foggy night to feel sure the Shore Patrol.

Having lived in New York Harbor, sea, I heard the ships fog horns every time it foggy, if the COAST GUARD did not hear of FOG HORNS, I think it is about time they learned.

However that is his explanation and I hope this form tells some folks that SOME PEOPLE like a TV HAND such as the COLONEL who wrote that book fell over a year ago. I have made a standing offer.

This is it.

Do you want to see a U.F.O. any night in the week ?
Have you any equipment that can test it over a distance ?
I can point it out, if you have the time to wait.
Can you take any pictures of it ?
Can you "triangle" it in some matches ?
See it with the naked eyes, telescopes., or any way you prefer. Set your equipment up in my back yard, leave it, and come back to-morrow night and find your tests.
If one night is not enough- take a week.
That is the offer I made and still stands.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Now, after sighting this object, and several others, (large ones) and many small ones, I am going to really try and think back over a year ago for the first time, and would like to explain the history.

Sighting it every night, and watching it, and seeing an erratic pattern, so you may consider continuing a little, but I shall try and be as simple, and as plain as I can be.

If you only knew, however, you may want, please remember MY OWN time is VERY LIMITED. But that some good, and may be you can take over after I go out to work for my daily wages. 

I have lived all my life in Sacramento, California. I now live at Pleasanton, California, and still see the objects.

One large one, over the year has changed the pattern of flight, and when I say, I could show rather than tell. 

I have counted as many as three, from the same general area, arising in one night.

a lot of my co-workers at General Motors, have also sighted these.

They did not have the same thing happen to them, as they did not care as much as I do. It does not look like that.

It moves slowly, and must be watched, constantly as and compared to a stationary object, like the roof on T.V. to see.

Recently having moved to Pleasanton, I have shown several people through a pair of 7x50 binoculars. Another object, (large) the same kind as I muse at the plant at times. This is not the same one.

altho a scope or binoculars are not needed, to see this. I shall fill the form out, and if you would like to take any gases, please feel it is any further information, for ever required.

P.S. I have heard of several other sightings over near Santa Cruz, California, area, but the same more lower and shorter. Strictly hearsay.

MORE SAUCER LANDINGS IN MONTANA: According to a weird story in the Missoulian-Sentinel, an Missoula, Montana, flying saucer has been landing frequently at a farm near there ever since early last April. Mr. and Mrs. Allen Lung, who live on the saucer as a mountain say that the object has landed within a few hundred feet of their house, and have asked through the saucer lights around its circumference. It also has a single large light on its slightly illuminated disc. 

There have been many side-effects of these frequent visitations. Before the landings began, the wild game much as deer used to visit their property. Crows, starlings, and many other birds would dwell around their home, but ever since last April, causing the latter to stampede. Every time the UFO is in the vicinity, their dog, which is normally unafraid, has told his parents of a man with whom he talks, though he has told them the man's name. But no one else besides this little boy seems to be present on these occasions, and is sometimes away for hours. Each time the boy goes into the house and the oil furnace lights go out. Television interference has also been noticed during the saucer visitations, which have continued at almost regular intervals for several months!

TACOMIANS SEE WEIRD OBJECT

Tacoma, Washington, April 4 - A mysterious pink object passed directly over Tacoma at 7:16 p.m. Witnesses included Mrs. A.H. Porter and her daughter Frances, 21, who were reported driving east on 11th Street when they observed the object.

The UFO was described as appearing somewhat like an airplane when it first came into view. It was circular and a "pinkish-pinkish" color. The object suddenly stopped and was stationary for some time, then started moving again, apparently vanishing while in full view near the vicinity of the KTNT-TV towers.

Canyon Heights Junior High School students Pam Watson and Theresa Mazzano, both 14, had also observed the object above the television towers. They stated that the UFO was a reddish-purple color, and was traveling southward.

The report asserts that fragments were that the fragment were that the object was Just prior to its disappearance. McCord Air Force Base authorities and city police could offer no explanation for the strange phenomenon.

UFO form continued
Dear sir,- my daughter, a tiled 15 stopped in, telling me that while they were out in the yard they had seen a strange looking craft in the sky. It was about 40 feet in diameter, silver in color and perfectly round, with a dome in the center. It hovered without a sound for about 5 minutes, then took off at a great rate of speed, going straight up. The whole thing was witnessed by my daughter and son-in-law and several of their friends. They were quite excited and frightened by the experience.
I do not understand these things, but thought you should know about this. We have had no radar contacts or other unusual occurrences in this area that I know of, so this would seem to be an isolated incident, at least as far as this location is concerned.
I am concerned that more and more of these things are being reported. If they are from outer space, I hope their intentions are friendly. Do you have any information that would help explain or reassure concerning these matters? I would appreciate hearing from you.
Sincerely,

4 TH AND 8.7 THE UNKNOWN OBJECTS DID WHAT?: ACCORDING TO THE RANKLIN WITNESSES, AS THEY HAVE H CRUDED DESCRIBED IT, THE OBJECT HOVERED AND SWAYED FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR SOME TIME, THEN SUDDENLY DISCHARGED A BRILLIANT BLUE-WHITE BEAM OF LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO STRIKE THE WATER OF THE CANYON FERRY RESERVOIR. AT THE END OF THIS BEAM WAS A DISTINCTIVE ORANGE COLORED LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO BE BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. THE BEAM AND LIGHT WERE VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 10 SECONDS, THEN BOTH DISAPPEARED AS SUDDENLY AS THEY HAD APPEARED. THE ORANGE LIGHT ITSELF WAS QUITE BRIGHT AND GLOWED FOR ANOTHER FEW SECONDS BEFORE FADING OUT COMPLETELY.

PAGE 4 RUMBJO 1 UNCLASS: BLUE COLORED OVAL-SHAPED OBJECTS WERE THE SUBJECT OF THIS CASE. SEVERAL PERSONS REPORTED HAVING SEEN THESE OBJECTS UNDER OBSERVATION FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. THE OBJECTS WERE DESCRIBED AS BEING 40 TO 50 FEET IN DIAMETER AND ABOUT 15 FEET THICK, WITH A BLUE COLORED LIGHT SEEMINGLY EMANATING FROM THEM. THE OBJECTS MANEUVERED OR HOVERED OVER THE CANYON FERRY RESERVOIR FOR SOME PERIOD OF SEVERAL MINUTES. AT TIMES THEY WERE OBSERVED TO DISCHARGE A BRIGHT BLUE-WHITE BEAM OF LIGHT DOWN TOWARD THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. THESE BEAMS WERE SEEN BY SEVERAL WITNESSES AND REPORTEDLY ILLUMINATED THE AREA BENEATH THE OBJECTS. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SIGHTINGS, THE LOCAL RADIO STATION WAS NOTIFIED BY WITNESSES WHO DESCRIBED WHAT THEY HAD SEEN. THE COUNTY SHERIFF DESCRIBES HIS OBSERVATIONS LATE ON THE SAME DAY... LAUGHED IT OFF AS LIKELY A PRANK OR HOAX BY PERSONS IN AN AIRCRAFT.

PAGE 5 RUMBJO 1 UNCLAS: 23937-12393 CLASSIFIED WITH LABEL SCATTERED GLASS. THIS SECOND PAGE OF THE REPORT INDICATES THAT SEVERAL PERSONS WERE WITNESSES TO THIS SIGHTING ON OR ABOUT 23 MARCH 39. IT REFERS TO A "4-CAR CARAVAN" AND THAT "ALL AT 23939" WERE PRESENT FOR THE EVENT. IT MENTIONS SPECIFIC DISTANCES AND DIRECTIONS INVOLVED, AS WELL AS TIMES OF OBSERVATIONS. FURTHER DETAILS INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED TO MANEUVER OR HOVER IN A VERY UNUSUAL MANNER OVER THE CANYON FERRY RESERVOIR, AND ALSO DISCHARGED A BRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT DOWN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS. INVESTIGATION OF THIS CASE DID NOT RESULT IN ANY IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECTS, ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT THEY WERE LIKELY SOME SORT OF UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENON RATHER THAN CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. FURTHER DETAILS AND ANALYSIS OF THE CASE ARE ALSO INCLUDED.

The text in the document is as follows:

The sight is said to have a slightly larger size than a quarter. It appeared to be round and metallic in nature. It was hovering at an estimated altitude of 300 feet and was traveling at a high rate of speed, approximately 700 mph. It was first observed by the observer and another person approximately 2 miles south of Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana. It disappeared rapidly out of sight, proceeding in a northerly direction. The observer was certain that what he observed was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, balloon or other known object. The report states that during the time of the sighting, the weather was clear and there was a full moon. The observer described the object as having no visible means of propulsion or lights, and it made no sound. The report indicates that the observer was an employee of the Bonneville Power Administration and had sighted many conventional aircraft during his employment over the years. He was confident that this sighting was of an unusual nature.

Text from the document:

Here is a true account of what I saw in the night of early spring 1964, a strange object (the size of a car 20 years old) actually slowly flew over, and I saw a ray of light come down from it. Then it stopped at the half moon and each towed it up and said that it had to go to another place again an hour later a brilliant light took off suddenly.
The object was bow shaped and the little light in the center attracted my attention it seemed that someone was directing it with a switch to each side.
The way that it flew was like a child's top when wobbling on its axis, rising higher and higher. At least some more five minutes but it wasn't out of sight entirely. But I didn't look after it much longer.

This page from the Project Blue Book report does not contain any photographs. The text describes an incident that occurred near Canyon Ferry Lake in Montana, where investigators found several holes in the ground along the shoreline, apparently caused by some type of unidentified flying object. The report includes details such as the size and depth of the holes, as well as witness accounts of a bright glow in the area around the time of the incident. The text also mentions a separate incident reported from Socorro, New Mexico.

U.S.A.
More marks on the ground

The following account is taken from the Helena Gazette for May 1, 1964. The sheriff's office said today it is investigating marks left on the ground by what was described as an unidentified flying object. Reports indicate the area east of Canyon Ferry Lake near Montana river was sighted - the spot on the night of April 29, along the shoreline of Canyon Ferry Lake. They found four holes about 13 feet apart, six to eight inches deep and eight to 10 inches across. The holes were small, like direct fuel according to one reporter. A circular spot was entered into the top of the undisturbed grass, the spot appearing to be about six feet in diameter from the sheriff's report.
"I was looking at the glow in my bedroom window," she said. She said she and her brother, home alone, sighted it about 10:30 p.m.
The holes were discovered about 125 feet from the rear of the Davis home and about the same distance from the lake shore.
The reports of the scorched area indicate a saucer-shaped object with marks in the ground, according to local police. A Socorro incident is reported fully elsewhere in this issue. (Credit to Mr. Ronald W.J. Anslee)

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the document discusses a sighting incident that occurred in Montana on April 29, 1964, where residents reported a weird light hovering above the area and the Air Force later deemed it a "hoax".

The text in the document is as follows:

AIR FORCE CABLES MONTANA SIGHTING "HOAX"
Helena, Montana, April 29 - Residents reported a weird light hovering above the east shore of a lake, and immediately took off, soon disappearing in the sky. Several youngsters, who had witnessed the startling occurrence, told officers the object had been about 10 to 12 feet in diameter. They were described as rapidly varying in size and a distinct reddish-orange in color. The object had risen to a height of approximately 25 to 30 feet, and then suddenly took off at a terrific rate of speed, disappearing in the northwest. Air Force officials investigated the incident, and later reported that the sighting was a "hoax".
MEANWHILE, IN Baltimore a missile astronomer who had been quoted in a national magazine as saying the Air Force's report on the Cany on Ferry Lake, Montana landing, described earlier in this issue, was a hoax, said this statement was misinterpreted. He said he considers the Air Force's explanation of the incident "reasonable".

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report about a UFO sighting incident that occurred near Canyon Ferry Lake in Montana on April 30th, 1964.

The text in the document is as follows:

MONTANA UFO LANDING CALLED HOAX BY AIR FORCE! At Canyon Ferry Lake, near Helena, Montana, another "flying saucer" incident in the recent U.S. "flap" occurred on April 30th, when numerous residents reported seeing a strange, bright object hover above the ground and then take off. When adults reached the scene a short time later, they found four indentations in the ground about 13 feet apart in a square pattern. Each hole was six to eight inches in diameter, and they were tapered toward the bottom as though made by a sharp-pointed object. The holes were also surrounded by a scorched area about four feet in diameter, indicating that extreme heat had been present.

Officials from nearby Malmstrom Air Force Base took over the investigation of the site and questioned the children, but a later report was issued that the explanation failed to satisfy the parents of the four youngsters nor the majority of the other residents. Many of whom had made confirmatory sightings of an object in the sky. As bright "as an arc light set up on a hill," it seems to have disappeared in view of the amazing similarity to the New Mexico landings, that officials dismissed this case all too quickly!

Wyoming Reports Sightings
New Mexico's "flying saucer" incidents seem to have spread northward.
Latest reports of weird objects floating around in great glee today from Wyoming and Montana in the high Rockies. This is the area where many believe "they" are basing their spacecrafts...where many have been sighted and tracked by ranchers and farmers over the years. Two women in a car on a ranch near Casper, Wyoming, said there was a huge flash of light and their car engine stopped. Mrs. Max De Weese, didn't see the object, but said there was a strange bright light in the car. J. later after taking the other two women home, the engine restarted.

RESIDENTS of the resort area near Helena said they saw a strange bright object hover just above the west shore of the lake, touch the ground, lift again and then disappear. Newsmen who went to the scene found four holes in the ground which looked as though some heavy object had been placed there. There was a burned area in the center of the holes.

The text in the document reads as follows:

ASTRONOMY

Spring Star Groups Appear

The lovely star groups of Ursa Major, the larger bear, of which the big dipper (seven) is a part, and Ursa Minor, the smaller bear, with the little dipper and Polaris, the north star, are generally noted that there are few visible in the April skies, while the first week of April will provide the best opportunity of the year to see Mercury.

By JAMES STOKLEY

WITH THE COMING of April the belt-like constellations of winter in the west, such as Orion, Taurus and Gemini, can still be glimpsed low in the west. To take their place, the lovely star groups of Ursa Major, the larger bear, of which the big dipper (seven) is a part, and Ursa Minor, the smaller bear, with the little dipper and Polaris, the north star, are shown on the accompanying maps, which depict the sky at about 9 p.m. in the beginning of April. They look the same as in midmonth, but will be higher in the evening sky.

In addition to the stars, there is also the planet Venus, which shining brilliantly in the western sky is the evening "star" at present. 

It is in the constellation of Taurus, the bull, one of those groups which was so prominent on winter evenings.

However, now toward the east and northeast a rather different set of stellar configurations is becoming prominent. This is the constellation of Leo, the lion, with Regulus, the first magnitude star, at the sickle-shaped head, and the twin stars Castor and Pollux in Gemini, the twins, farther to the north.

But now, more toward the south and east of the groupings of stars that typify the spring sky, such as Leo and Virgo, the virgin, can be seen. Spica, a first magnitude star, is in Virgo, a little northwest of the star Arcturus in Bootes, the herdsman, with brilliant Arc...

LETTER for MARCH 28, 1964

MEDICINE

Tiny G Suits Advised For Premature Infants

MINIATURIZED SPACE SUITS have been seriously suggested as garments for premature infants. The suits are designed to improve blood circulation and bring benefits for the newborn from this country's advanced space program-results reported by Dr. Mary Allen Engle of Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, in studies of the effects of pressure in which body fluids are displaced.

In addition to the American Medical Association's ex-president, Dr. Louis H. Bauer, chief scientist, reports Medicine Today, two outstanding scientists--Dr. John P. Greenhill, obstetrician, and Dr. Murdock Head, physiologist, of the University of California, have enthusiastically endorsed the development of miniaturized "g suits" for premature babies.

Text Output:

Alliance, Ohio....April, 1964....A large orange glow, was the first thing noticed around 5:30 A.M. on this morning. Directly east, in the distance it seemed to be hovering, and then suddenly disappeared against a large white building about 400 yards away, on his neighbor's property. The observer-claimed redditional sharp object, 1 1/2 times as high as the white building itself, about 100 feet broad, was moving to and fro in a radius of about 50 yards, this object being in the air above the building. Its dimensions being greatest. He could not determine the exact attitude, due to the dimness. After about 10 seconds, it darted away to the east and by the time he had run inside to obtain his binoculars, it was no longer be seen. He couldn't discern anything where the object had been. In the morning, early, he went down into the pasture and saw some peculiar markings on the ground. The grass and ground were flattened. No residual marks could be found, that would indicate any landing or take-off. After careful search, no other evidence could be found. Subscribing to the investigators' opinion, similar but incomplete "design" on the ground. Substantiating witnesses have not been contacted on this recently discovered sighting.

The form of these discolorations: generally hour glass-like.

Cat hitting on the earth approximately one hundred and fifty (150) feet from the area where they were playing hide-and-seek. The witnesses stated they saw the object descend to the earth but only for a short duration, estimated at about ten seconds. All witnesses described the object being of oval or round shape which glowed. They state the object moved slowly downwards and then suddenly shot upwards at a high rate of speed.

The object was estimated to be from twenty to forty feet in diameter. Two other witnesses stated that when it left the ground it proceeded immediately at an angle of thirty to forty-five degrees. Four witnesses said the object hovered directly over the area for a short period of time before suddenly moving away at a high rate of speed. The fifth witness said the object made a V-turn and hovered momentarily before speeding away.

Several witnesses stated they saw no appendages, wheels, or other external features on the object. The witnesses state they saw no streens or smoke from the object and described it as silently operating. All reported that the object gave off a bright light which illuminated the area.

All reported the object as silvery, metallic appearing. At the place where the object touched the ground, the witnesses found an area approximately 15 ft x 10 ft which was flattened as if something heavy had landed. Reportedly, there were 13 incidents between the dates of 19 to 25 April 1964, all in the general area of Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana.

No Case Info Only
7 March 1967

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

Reference your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object in the Port Arthur, Ontario area. 

An investigation will not be undertaken because the location is outside the continental limits of the United States. The information will be filed for future scientific studies.

The U.S. Air Force has received over 11,000 sightings of UFOs since 1947. Although there are some cases we have not been able to explain, we do not feel that enough evidence has been found to say that UFOs and extraterrestrial vehicles are the same. There is not any tangible evidence which can substantiate the belief that our planet has been or is being visited by extraterrestrial life.

It is more likely that UFOs represent some unexplained scientific phenomena.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Sir:

I am writing to you about an incident that occurred on March 24, 1964, near the Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana. 

On that date, my son and I were fishing near the reservoir when we observed an unusual aerial object. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and was hovering silently over the water. As we watched, the object suddenly accelerated and climbed rapidly out of sight.

I am aware that the Air Force has an ongoing investigation into unidentified flying objects, and I felt it was my duty to report this incident to you. I would be more than happy to provide any additional information or details that may be of assistance to your study.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

"Commander of the Missile site notified by Colonel Sheppard of an unusual object sighted over the Canyon Ferry Reservoir, 10 miles NE of Helena, Montana, on the evening of April 8, 1964. The missile site personnel had observer this object for several hours, and their description appears to be as follows:

Object was observed to appear at approximately 2045 hours to the NW over the reservoir at an estimated altitude of 2000 feet. Object was observed through binoculars and was approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length. Object appeared to be hovering or stationary with no apparent propulsion system visible. After hovering for approximately 30-45 minutes, object accelerated from the area at a tremendous rate of speed, climbing rapidly out of sight, in a NW direction. During the entire sighting, the object exhibited no exhaust or trail."

"During flight, at 5:48 PST, my attention was attracted by a bright yellow-orange light in the eastern sky, which appeared to be about 5-10 degrees above the horizon. This light seemed to be stationary and did not blink or move in any way. I observed it for about 10 minutes and then it gradually disappeared, seeming to fade out. There were no clouds in the sky and the weather was clear. The light did not appear to be connected with any known aircraft. I have observed many aircraft in the past and this light was unlike any aircraft lights I have ever seen. It was a steady, bright, yellow-orange light, with no blinking or flashing. The light did not move or change in any way during the time I observed it. I would appreciate any information you may have concerning this sighting. Sincerely,"

There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a typed report or summary describing alleged sightings of "flying saucers" landing in Montana. The text describes the objects as "a large top-shaped ship with a row of lights around its circumference" and mentions various details about the sightings, including claims of effects on electrical equipment and the reactions of a witness. The document is marked as "Information Only" and appears to be from the Missoula, Montana area in April.

MORE SAUCER LANDINGS IN MONTANA: According to a weird story in the Missoulian-Sentinel, in Missoula, Montana, flying saucers have been "landing frequently" at a farm there since early last April. Mr. and Mrs. Allen Lund, who live on the slopes of a mountain, say that the object has landed three times recently, and has made some unusual maneuvers. The Lunds describe the object as "a large top-shaped ship with a row of lights around its slightly rounded bottom surface."

There have been many side-effects of these frequent visitations. Before the landings began, wild game such as deer and bear used to visit their property regularly. Each landing frightens and drives them away, however, and it is sometimes several days before they return. The oil furnace lights itself, with no apparent explanation. But strongest of all, says the Lund's son, 35 years old, is the bolt of a man with whom he talks, alone in the barn. He has told them the man's name, but Miss Lund says the man almost unrecognizable. The child refuses to allow anyone to accompany him when the man appears, and likewise, the boy does "to go see the man," the dogs run into the house and the oil furnace lights. Television interference has also been noticed during the saucer visitations, which have continued at almost regular intervals for several months.

Croydon was in the news once more. A report from the Croydon Advertiser on April 17 carried the headline "Woman sees strange object in sky."
"When Mrs. May Church looked out of the front window of her flat in Far Tree Gardens, Shirley, on Sunday night, she stared at another unidentified flying object converging with the W. P., as Mr. Church saw a large, dull, glowing object moving slowly across the sky. Her husband, Alfred, and some friends who were there at the time also watched it."
"The Defense Ministry spokesman said we have no knowledge of any unidentified objects being seen. And as far as I know, there are no expected artificial satellites flying over this area tonight."
"According to the report, the object was first sighted between 8.40 p.m. and 9.10 p.m. on Sunday night (April 12), and it was watched for over 20 minutes. It looked like a star moving across the sky, but it was definitely not a balloon or an aircraft. It was too large to be a plane, and it gave no indication that it was an aircraft, said Mr. Church."
"A group of people, including the Methodist minister, the Reverend J. W. Parsons, were also reported to have been watching the object on Sunday night."
"It looked like a star, but it was much larger than a star and was glowing," said Mr. Church. "It was like a star that had changed into something else. And it was moving across the sky as though it was a balloon, but it wasn't a balloon. It was definitely something unusual."

I am requesting all available information regarding the sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects over Baton Rouge, Louisiana on the night of April 6, 1964. The report of these sightings was first learned on the wire services early in the A.M. of April 7, 1964.

Briefly: many objects were seen all over the county, in the cities as well as in rural areas. One object was reported to have landed, leaving a large crater. Sheriffs and all available police were investigating. No one hurt thus far. No explanation. That was the last of these reports on the wire services, according to officials of the wire services. 

Let's have the full story.

Dear Col. Spaulding:

I am requesting all available information regarding the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object over the eastern coast of the island of Trinidad on the 24th of January, 1958. Although the Brazilian Navy investigated the sighting, and in their intelligence report concluded the object, I understand the U.S. Air Force has also taken particular interest in this sighting area. The U.S. Air Force requested and received documents from the Brazilian Navy regarding the sighting in order to aid in our own investigation. I would like the documents were four photographs of the object which the U.S. government planned to use as part of the U.S. Air Force's investigation. Can you tell me what did the U.S. photographic advisors have to say regarding the photographs? I would also appreciate a reproduction of the detailed analysis sheet regarding the photographs.

The image contains a report page from Project Blue Book with a detailed description of four circular holes found at the Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana. The holes are described as being approximately three to four feet in diameter, with no apparent evidence that they were caused by a great weight. Instead, the holes appear to have been crudely dug or scooped out, with the largest hole being approximately sixteen inches wide. The report mentions six alleged eyewitnesses, one of whom was interviewed, and their descriptions of the object as being round or oval-shaped. The lighting of the object is also described, and the report states that the accounts of all the witnesses contained many discrepancies.

and approximately three-four feet in diameter. The holes did not
appear to have been caused by great weight. Rather the holes appear-
ed to have been crudely dug or scooped out. At the surface one hole
was twice the size of the smallest hole in diameter. The largest
hole is diameter was approximately sixteen inches wide the smallest
hole being an  approximately five to eight inches.
The holes were located in a straight line and were approximately
five to six feet apart. The holes varied from five to eight inches
in depth. The dirt surrounding the holes was fine and very dry. The
four holes are located on a vacant plot of ground approximately 200
ft. from the base of one of the five witness.

PART II. There were six alleged eye-witnesses, one of
whom was not interviewed at his father's request. The witnesses were
often vague and evasive and their respective stories contained much
side differences as to convince the interrogators that the entire
event was a fanciful hoax. However, not one witness would deviate
from the position that they did see something. Four witnesses
described the object as being round or oval shaped which were the
size and shape locally reported to be having been seen in the locality.
All witnesses were adamant on their description and manner. Four witnesses used the word
"luminous" to describe the lighting of the object. These consistencies 
encies indicated by the witnesses. The accounts of all
witness on their movements immediately after the sighting contained
so many discrepancies as there were witnesses interviewed. Addition-
al analysis of the witnesses' stories more than more than established
this event was a foolish hoax.

Hole in Yard

BATON ROUGE, La., Apr. 7 - (UPI) - An object fell screaming from the sky into a residential back yard last night, digging a four-foot-deep crater in the earth.

There were reports of four other objects falling in cultivating areas.

Dr. Raymond Grenchik, professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University, said the objects could have been pieces of a meteorite.

FLOYD L. MARALON said one of the objects plunged through a large tree in his back yard, creating a crater about 13 inches wide and four feet deep. He said the object broke branches as it went and dug a crater about that depth.

Police dug down six feet in Maralon's yard. They found the hole at that depth, but nothing else.

No unidentified objects were observed accompanying or pursuing the GT-1 spacecraft, launched into orbit on April 9, 1964. Objects observed were identified as parts of the spent launch vehicle booster and minor structural pieces which routinely break free from the expendable booster portion in the spacecraft and booster separation process. There is no indication of the presence of any material which was not originally part of the launched vehicle.

CENSORSHIP AND UFOs
Article by Major Donald E. Keyhoe
USMC (Ret) - True Magazine - January, 1964

On April 8, 1964, the NASA launched from Cape Kennedy the Gemini 1 capsule. The capsule was to be an unmanned test of the orbit around the earth, and was declared a complete success.

But there are some strange things about this successful flight, which are not generally known to the public confidentially by two witnesses present at the test. The Gemini 1 Capsule was still in its first orbit when four strange objects, originating from the unknown or unknown origin, flew up to the capsule and paced their course in amazement as the capsule had its four successful orbits.

The two witnesses, who are well-known persons, described this sighting in confidence. They drew closer to the capsule and paced it for about two minutes. Suddenly, the four objects shot away at tremendous speed and vanished into the unknown.

Major Keyhoe asks: "What were these four mysterious space travelers? Where had they come from? What was their mission? The beings, were at the controls of these strange craft, and I could answer none of their questions and I would not be surprised to find that the beings inside the craft were as astounded at the presence of the capsule as we were at their sudden appearance, and their disappearance was just as dramatic."

The general public is unaware of facts such as these that happen many times over near pocket test ranges. Satellite tracking confirms that serious alien craft are watching our outer space efforts. The public also believes that the aerial wave of UFOs have been an invasion. The Air Force is completely aware that more serious alien craft are watching our outer space efforts. The public also believes that the aerial wave of UFOs have been an illusion, whereas facts disclose that the real wave of UFOs have not been an illusion.

From the Butte Evening Telegraph, April 16 '64:
"A strange object with a bright green and blue light was seen in the sky late last night by a St. Andrews family.
"Thomas Marshall, 35, of 1412 Lewis, Woodburn Place, said he and his family spotted the object while in their yard with the family's dog from Woodburn Place.
"'It started out,' he said, 'as a small silvery-grey cloud.' 'A light appeared in the center of it and started to move towards me. The light got brighter all the time as it came nearer and I could see 'yellow green and blue colors in it. There were about seven or eight.'"
"The shape changed and flattened as it got nearer from roughly circular to oval. It wavered, then suddenly went behind the house next door. The only thing was it didn't swing round or bank like an aeroplane does - it was just as if it went in." 
"Mr. Marshall saw the object reappear and go through the same performance before he reached home. He called out his wife and daughter and the three of them saw it for some more before it disappeared for good at 11:40."

Walthamstow "object from space"

The Walthamstow Guardian reported an incident on April 13, 1964 in the 17 issue "An unidentified flying object hurtled through the air, severed telephone wires, etched a deep scar in the concrete side of a Bower Lane house, and ploughed into a back garden pond". 

The report was received by police just before 8 o'clock on Monday night (April 13). It came from a Walthamstow resident, Mrs. R. O. Ball, of 47 Upper Walthamstow Road, who stated that she had been awakened by a very loud noise and had seen something go straight across the road and into a back garden in Berry Lane. They found the phone wires down, and a search of the bank revealed nothing. The river was dredged—in vain.

Cyril this was reported as he drove home in the early hours of Tuesday morning. He said, "I just glanced into her back and saw something leaving from the back of the house straight across the road and, had I been a few yards further forward, I would have been hit by it." The object, he said, was very fast. "It was traveling very straight across the road and, had I been a few yards further forward, I would have been hit by it."

At first I thought the back window of the house had come in and as I approached I could see plastic splinters on the ground. There was a big splash in the water. 

A police spokesman said that four ducks had been disturbed while the river was being dredged and that was all that could be found.

The image contains a scanned document with text describing a report about a triangular-shaped object observed over Lyons, France on April 17. The report mentions that the object was observed by multiple witnesses, including at the Lyons-Bron Airfield, and that it exhibited various characteristics such as a changing azimuth angle, illumination, and slow traversal across the sky. The document also mentions that the British authorities were unable to "explain" the Hertfordshire object, and suggests that the French authorities may be more prepared to address this type of phenomenon.

The Le Figaro on April 17 reported
that a mysterious luminous object was
observed in the sky over Lyons, France
on the evening of April 16. 
observers
in the sky would not have attracted
attention, and the object, which was of
a triangular shape, appeared to be moving.
At the Lyons-Bron Airfield it was also
seen by observers. Police received
calls from citizens who are unable to explain its presence
in the sky.
The object was observed with an
azimuth of 309 degrees and it even
showed a inclination of 32 degrees.
It presented an inclination of 32 degrees,
but this inclination slowly decreased
and after some minutes it was only 43
degrees. Observed with a powerful
telescope, the object appeared of
triangular shapes, powerfully illuminated by the sun which had already
gone down. It resembled a large empty
carton, or a big star, but the fact of
the matter is that something which was
slowly traversing the sky.
Experts say that interested to compare this sighting with a similar one
observed over England in 1962. The
full report of this incident witnessed
by numerous people to the National
Saucer Review, November-December, 
1963, issue. The photo, reproduced in this issue, taken 
by Mr Jan Willemyns who lives at
Rimby, Mern, may indicate that
the British authorities are unable to
"explain" the Hertfordshire object
as a weather balloon but for several
reasons this was nonsensical. It would
seem that the French authorities are
more prepared to let the facts speak
for themselves.

Mrs Hunt/sh/SAFOICC/72842/16 Nov 65

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your report of aerial objects which you were unable to identify.

The objects reported are characteristic of observations of astronomical bodies:

The first object in the northeast is the star Capella; the second object at 060 degrees azimuth is the planet Jupiter; the third object rising at 060 degrees azimuth is the star Betelgeuse.

Jupiter is visible at about 9:30 PM, and Betelgeuse is visible at about 10:00 PM. The star Capella appears at 0:25 degrees azimuth at 6:00 PM, but it may not be visible until the sun sets.

Thank you for submitting your report to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

J. Quintile, USAF

ENGLISH-SPEAKING LITTLE MEN LAND IN NEW YORK STATE: A farmer in Newark Valley, near Binghamton, New York, claims that he spoke to little men who landed in a craft near his farmhouse. The farmer, named Gary Wilcox, told his story to a local newspaper several days later. He claimed that he had no fear of the humanoid creatures "because they weren't hostile" and seemed to have no weapons or any desire to harm him.
Wilcox said he was standing in his cornfield on his 300 acre farm when he saw a glitter like the reflection from a mirror. At first he thought it was merely the sun reflecting, but then he saw a smooth, egg-shaped luminous object about 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. Wilcox walked up and looked inside the craft. He said it was made of some sort of seamless material, and they were wearing suits made of some sort of material, according to Wilcox, but he could not tell what part of their bodies their voices came from. They told him not to tell what he had seen, and that they would not return to Earth; and that for his own good, he should not try to investigate them further. 
This incident tends to confirm the veracity of Gary Wilcox, a farmer living in nearby Newark Valley, New York, who reported back in April that he conversed with two little men who identified themselves as Martians. This incident is described in detail in our September issue.

Down on the farm
We are indebted to Mr. W. T. Shannon for having sent us a clipping from the Herkimer (N.Y.) newspaper, issue of May 9. The article has to do with an incident near Binghamton, N.Y. The account reads as follows: "A dairy farmer reported that a bright flash was seen over a field near his home on the night of May 3 by his wife and hired man. They went to investigate and saw an odd-shaped object on the ground, and approached it with curiosity. The report has been forwarded to the Sheriff's Department but further inquiries have been inconclusive.
The Tioga County Sheriff's Department also reported an investigation of a similar nature, according to news received from him. Also, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has apparently been called in on the inquiry. Details from the investigation of this acre dairy farm a few miles northeast of Newark Valley, said that a 'metallic object' had apparently landed and then taken off again in the field. A neighbor informed him about what happened and he went to interview him about the incident, but finally gave up as the man could not tell 'what he had seen'.
On the morning of April 23, Mr. Wallace, who owns his farm near the reservoir, decided to inspect his field. Shortly before 10 o'clock, he decided to go down to the area where the object had apparently landed the previous evening. He wanted to see whether ground conditions would permit planting that day.
The object was reported to be about a mile from his dairy barn, he saw a shiny object at the edge of his field. As he approached the field, he saw that the object had been in the field for some time. He recalled that the shine upon it had caught his eye some little time ago, as he drew nearer. His next thought was that it was a swing tool or some other object dropped in the field. The object was shiny and looked something like aluminum, but he could not tell what it was.
He decided to examine it more closely to have metallic characteristics different from anything he had ever seen before. The object was about 12 feet high and 16 feet wide and was shaped like an "egg". He approached it and felt no heat. He observed no door or escape hatch, but was 'bumptious' man, and decided to take a closer look. He noticed that on the ground, four feet tall, were clothing that appeared to have no seams and that on one side of the object he saw what appeared to be a full-face hood. He could not distinguish any usual features because of the reflection. He thought perhaps these were dummies or life-like features exposed on the outside, but he could not determine whether they had feet and toes.

FARMER CLAIMS' CONTACT

Newark Valley, New York, April 24 - As if similar sightings were not sufficient, word has reached us of a most interesting "little green men" contacts, alleged to have been experienced by a young farmer in upstate New York.

Gary T. Wilcox, the supposed eyewitness, reports that shortly before dawn on the morning of April 17, he was awakened by a strange light in his bedroom. On further investigation, he observed a shiny object descending upon his farm, just south of his residence. As it touched down, the object - described as being similar in appearance to a military refrigerator - issued a beam of light, which scanned the area adjacent to the object, and then disappeared. He soon noticed two small humanoid figures, approximately 3 feet in height, suddenly appeared. They were dressed in what seemed to be a strange, one-piece, turtle-neck-like affair, whose color Wilcox described as resembling weathered aluminum. According to Wilcox, these strange creatures then began operating a very unusual piece of equipment, which he described as "odd-shaped" and resembling "breathing apparatus".

2-Owego Times, Owego, N.Y., Friday
Newark Valley Farmer Repo
An astounding report of a visit of two Martians
to the Towner of Newark Valley recently has created
a great stire of excitement and speculation throughout the area.
The source of the amazing story is Gary Wilcox, well-
known and substantial farmer, who solemnly asserts he
carried on a conversation with the two persons from
another planet after their spaceship or flying saucer landing in a back lot on his Davis Hollow Road farm.
The visit occurred on Friday, April 24. Mr. Wil-
cox told The Times, adding that he was present
when the pair took off in their peculiarly-shaped
conveyance.
No formal report was made to county authorities, but about 10:30 a.m. he said he had no idea how long it had

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an article with text discussing a reported encounter with what appears to be visitors from the planet Mars. The article describes a sighting by two men who claimed the visitors were dressed in aluminum-colored uniforms and were about four feet tall. The article also mentions that the visitors spoke good English and discussed topics such as farming practices and fertilizers with the eyewitnesses.

Arts Visit From Martians
He was attracted to the object by the shiny color, resembling the silvery wing of a plane.
He reached the object which was on landing four feet above the ground, two beings came under the object. They were dressed from head uniforms or costumes the same aluminum color conveyance.

Mr. Wilcox told The Times the two men, apparently, four feet in height, and they immediately in the conversation spoke as good English as I do," he said. visitors doing most of the talking. They him, Mr. Wilcox said, that they came from.

The Nevada Valley farmer said he returned to his barn to pick up some fertilizer and when he went back, the two men were getting back in the vehicle, with the admonition that "it will be to your benefint not to say anything about this."

This was about 12:30 p.m., he said, and he stood there when the queer-looking ship took off and whirled out of sight over the hill "so fast I could hardly see it." And that was the last Mr. Wilcox saw of the visitors.

He described the vehicle as being about 20 feet high, 16 feet wide and between 4 and 5 feet thick, with no visible indication of how it operated. It moved almost silently when it flashed away, he said.

That, to date, is the incredible story of Tioga County's exposure to the planet Mars.

Dear Mr. Sypek,

Thank you for your confidence - whatever program is your sincere wish - to the fair values the government of the scientific community, and to the Truth, I do not propose to consider your aptitude as unrealistic. I am convinced that you might be more successful in the work of the scientific area, perhaps you have made inquiries about it.
