1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 22 November 66, 2355Z
2. LOCATION: Fayetteville, N.C.
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 Minutes
6. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The observer reported seeing a pale yellow light in the sky which drifted slowly overhead. Children said it looked like a shooting star that did not go out. Sighting is very confusing with that of a flare. Official explanation is possible parachu flares as a probable explanation. The winds were to the SW and would have accounted for the slow SW drift.
7. COURSE: Steady to the SW
8. PHOTOS: NONE
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE
