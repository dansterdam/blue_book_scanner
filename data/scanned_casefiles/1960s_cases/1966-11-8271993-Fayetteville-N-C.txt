11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer reported pale yellow light in the NE which drifted slowly toward the SW. Children said it looked like shooting star that did not go out.
Sighting is very consistent with that of a flare. Investigation official believes that a high intensity parachute flare is a probable explanation. The winds were to the SW and would have accounted for the slow SW drift.

BELIEVES THIS COMMON LOCAL PRACTICE FITS PERFECTLY INTO OBSERVERS
