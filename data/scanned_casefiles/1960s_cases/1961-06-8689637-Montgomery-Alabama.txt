10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Star shaped object, size of pinhead, very bright with erratic slow movement. Did not twinkle like a star. Occasional movement in slight streak. Appeared to be a great height and heading toward the Southern horizon.

11. COMMENTS
Echo ruled out. Object movement tends to indicate balloon sighting, however the winds reported were from the west at lower altitude. The wind at 60,000 was from 090, but at a speed of only 5 knots. This would not move a balloon out of the area in 10 minutes. An air intercept was attempted and the pilot did not make contact with the object.

□ Was Aircraft
