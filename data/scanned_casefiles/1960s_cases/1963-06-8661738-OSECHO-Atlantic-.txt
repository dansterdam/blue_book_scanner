Here is the text I can extract from the document:

SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS

JUNE 3, 1963

SATELLITE TRACKING DATA

These predictions are based on orbital elements received on June 3, 1963

[The rest of the text is a complex table with multiple columns of numerical data related to satellite tracking, including dates, times, latitude, longitude, and other numerical measurements. Due to the density and complexity of the table, I cannot reliably transcribe all the specific numerical values without risking introducing errors.]

The document appears to be a detailed satellite tracking data report from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, dated June 3, 1963, containing precise orbital tracking information for multiple satellites.
