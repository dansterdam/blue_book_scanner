11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
THIS OBSERVER SENT A REPORT OF TWO UFOS THAT WERE SEEN IN THE
EARLY MORNING HOURS OF 21 JUNE TO THE PROJECT BLUE BOOK OFFICE.
ONE SIGHTING OCCURRED AT 3:45 AM AND THE OTHER AT 4:30 AM.
HOWEVER, ONLY ONE DURATION OF 25 SECONDS IS LISTED.

COMMENTS: AN AF FORM 117 WAS SENT TO THE WITNESS. HE RETURNED
HIS FORM APPARENTLY ON THE 4:30 AM SIGHTING. HE GIVES THE
DURATION OF THIS SIGHTING AS TWENTY MINUTES AND STATED THAT IT
TRAVELED SOUTH. (THE OBSERVER STATED THAT IT TRAVELED WEST)
IT APPEARS THAT THE OBSERVERS WERE WATCHING SATELLITES, HOWEVER,
BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICTING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE SIGHTING IS
BEING CARRIED AS CONFLICTING DATA.

WE WERE BOTH LOOKING AT STARS WITH TELESCOPE. WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A PLANET. WHEN TRIED TO PUT TELESCOPE (95-POWER WITH 4-FOOT TRIPOD) ON IT FOUND OUT IT WAS MOVING. THEN, WHILE FRIEND (KIM ACKERMANN) WAS TRYING TO PUT TELESCOPE ON IT, I RAN TO CAR AND TOOK BINOCULARS (7-POWER) AND PUT MY ELBOWS OUT, SO I WOUND IT JIGGLE (BINOCULARS WERE ALREADY FOCUSED) AND THEN LOOKED AT IT. SECOND SIGHTING MOVED FAST FROM EAST TO WEST, LOOKED THROUGH BINOCULARS, IT WAS THE SAME OBJECT DISAPPEARED IN CLOUDS. BEFORE FIRST SIGHTING, KIM SAW A SHOOTING STAR GO EAST TO NORTH.

The document also includes a hand-drawn diagram showing the movement of an object, with labels such as "MOVING SLOWLY", "OBJECT", "FRIEND", "CAR", "ME", and directional annotations from North to South.
