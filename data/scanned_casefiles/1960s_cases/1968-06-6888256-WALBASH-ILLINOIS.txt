The image appears to contain a handwritten document, but it does not include any photographs. The text in the document describes the observers' attempt to view a potential UFO/unidentified object using telescopes, but no visual evidence or photographs are provided.

WE WERE BOTH LOOKING AT STARS WITH TELESCOPE
WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A PLANET. WHEN TRIED
TO PUT TELESCOPE (95-POWER WITH 4-FOOT PAPON) ON IT, IT WAS MOVING. THEN, WHILE FRIEND (LEN ABESMANN)
WAS TRYING TO PUT TELESCOPES ON IT, I RAND TO CAR AND
TOOK BINOCULARS (7-POWER) AND PUT MY ELBOWS OUT, SO I
WOULD IT JIGGLE (BINOCULARS WERE ALREADY FOCUSED) AND
THEN LOOKED AT IT SECOND SIGHTING. MOVED FAST FROM EAST
TO WEST LOOKED THROUGH BINOCULARS,IT WAS THE SAME OBJECT. 
DISMISSED IT AS PROBABLE CLOUD, BEFORE FIRST SIGHTING, IT WAS
SILHOUETTED STAR SHAPED OBJECT TO NORTHWEST.

The image contains a compass rose diagram and two hand-drawn sketches. The compass rose diagram appears to be an illustration from a Project Blue Book report, providing instructions on how to record the direction and position of a UFO sighting using a compass. The two sketches depict a person standing in a landscape with mountains in the background.
