1. At approximate 1515 hours 31 July --, Colonel Mullins of AFLC called Project Blue Book office report-- that he had been in contact with Colonel Boland's office, Le-- slative Liaison, concerning Congressional Committee investigation-- the Air Force UFO Program. 
He further stated that a staff investigat-- or for the House Science and Astronautics Committee (Congressi-- al Subcommittee) Brooks, Los Angeles, Chairman) Mr. Dick Hines, was going to -- sit FID in about a week to -- 10 days, and Col. Boland suggested that -- prepare for his visit.
Col. Mullins was given Major Friends le-- phone number, and was going to give it to Col. Boland, as it is felt that it would be much to our advantage to have Major Fr-- end at FTD when Mr. Hines makes his visit.

TO:	General Pierce

1. Reference our memo dated 14 July (copy attached) information was received on 1 August 1961 from Lt Colonel Joseph S. Boland, Legislative Liaison Officer, to the effect that a Congressional investigation of the UFO program is definitely on the books. Mr. Richard Hines has expressed to WFAFB 3005 on 14 August. Mr. Hines is the Technical Assistant for the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Congressmen John McCormick (Mass.) , George P. Miller (Calif.), and Joseph Karth (Minn.) are behind the investigation.

2. I have alerted the Director of the UFO Program, who is presently on leave, to report back to WFAFB in time to meet with least one day in advance of the Committee's visit. I have also alerted the contractor, Dr. Hynek, to be prepared to report to WFAFB on the selected date of reported investigation.

3. I propose to receive Mr. Hines and, provided you agree, bring him to your office for introduction, and then conduct the discussions in my office.

4. I propose to conduct the investigation along the following lines:

a. FTD explores all reports and incidents concerning UFO items. Our objective is to get the facts, to analyze these facts, and to explain as clearly as possible the results of the analyses.

b. We seek no publicity on our activities nor embarrassment of any individuals involved in reporting UFO incidents. As a matter of fact we try to protect, to the maximum, the individuals concerned.

c. We have funds and personnel to investigate, on the spot, all incidents which appear to warrant such investigation. We utilize our own facilities and those of AFSC to make investigations and analyses.

d. We call upon the entire resources of the USAF to assist in the investigations of UFO incidents. Where a satisfactory explanation can be found by the local organization or units of the USAF these organizations are utilized to the fullest.

SUBJECT: Congressional Investigation of the UFO Program

TO: TDGC(General Pierce)

1. An article appeared in the 3 July 1961 issue of Newsweek, stating the possibility of a congressional investigation of the USAF UFO Program. Contact with the Secretary of Air Force, Legislative Liaison Office(SAFLL) revealed that there was no indication that such an investigation would take place.

2. Unofficial sources (SAFL) have it that Congressman Joseph E. Karth, Minnesota, of the House Science and Astronautics Committee (Congressman Overton Brooks, Los Angeles, Chairman) would head the investigating team. The investigation to be directed toward the USAF's handling of the UFO Program, and especially how the capabilities of the FTD in the analysis and investigation areas.

3. SAFL's present efforts are directed toward heading off the investigation. If it is to occur, it is to secure a hearing in Washington D.C. with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Consultant to the UFO Program and Major Robert J. Friend, Aerial Phenomena Branch TD-E in attendance.

4. If the investigation is carried out at FTD I intend to handle it within the Deputy's unless otherwise directed.

STATE DEPARTMENT -- Behind-the-scenes activity is building up interest in the New York headquarters building of his No. 2 man, Chester Bowles. Rusk is keeping an eye on the recalcitrant Bowles, persistent in his pet ideas that Rusk sometimes hasn't even seen.
NEW YORK CITY -- Putting sergeants into high posts on the New Frontier has played hell with the inner city Negroes' expectations for Negro advancement. Former NAACP heavyweight Clarence Mitchell (housing chief) went a powerful bit of his top legal moves against the NAACP bears it may lose a lot more in the wake of this school-integration case before the Supreme Court is in the running for a Federal judgeship.
HOUSE CLOAK ROOM -- Flying saucers are back. A special three-man House group will soon get down to serious studies and official reports (which have scoffed at such theories that they come from outer space).
GETTYSBURG, PA. -- Public speculation to the contrary, Ike's intimates insist the former President is giving no consideration to proposing that the GOP National Committee make him the party's nominee for Governor of Pennsylvania. "He'll remain active in public affairs as a Republican leader," says one friend, "but he won't go through another campaign undressings and recriminations."
"BEST NEWS" - The aircraft carrier Enterprise, due to put to sea in December, may have plans to be a ship without atomic power plants, the huge ship will be kept out of many harbors by the Navy's own safety rules to be used more for patrol or use secondary ports.
NASHVILLE, TENN -- Here's the story behind the anti-segregation suit filed by the NAACP in Nashville to halt its new school plan: a new and fiendishly ingenious weapon being tested by the Navy. It involves a delayed-action liquid explosive secreted in the city's bus transfer boxes where it is touched off by oxygen from the air, it blows up with a terrific force.

Periscoping the World

World Whispers
UNITED NATIONS - Buried in the mass of figures in the expense report on the U.N. posts on the basis of population, was this startling revelation: If bed the U.S. F. with 150 million population, would rate no less than 32 posts—six more than the U.S.
PARIS - Charles de Gaulle's troubles with the army may not be over. With 21 officers jailed (and another 130 already released from punishment) for taking part in the army revolt in Algeria, the French high command has been forced to fill key African posts with officers taken from Algeria because of the difficulty in finding enough regular troops.
BONN - Chancellor Adenauer gets a new look at Yuri Gagarin's spaceship next month. The occasion: A mammoth show to be held at Tushino airport just outside Moscow. And no one will be surprised at the Kremlin's move, of course, this is Gagarin's year - and the Soviets intend to make most of it for their new hero's glory.

Diplomatic Pouches
CONGO - Here is confirmation of our earlier suspicion that the Kremlin cares less than Moscow may be thought: He is shipping munitions to the Soviet Union and other Communist countries for failing to deliver commercial orders on time. And plans for a big non-core development program here are apparently held up because of the difficulty in getting sufficient quantities of needed materials.

PEKING - The Red Chinese are moving to woo more of the world's Muslims to their side - and they are being royally received by Arabs and others wherever they go. Peking's death-to-the-imperialists line finds a not unfavorable echo in Arab thinking captive in Nationalism.

VIENNA - Is the touted front-runner in the athletic events of the Beijing Spartaklad, Boss of the Russian athletes who was conspicuously absent from three previous Spartaklads, to be replaced by a young, sky-rocketing star? This would score a victory for the Soviet athletes, and give the start of the Soviet new strain and staying power.

LONDON - Britain's clinicians are thinking of a big carrier program to include at least three 50,000-ton monster carriers and similar bases to areas like the British West Indies and Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean; will lose their whole self-contained economy and as Red China gets stronger, this independent nation will be more vulnerable to China.

Congressional Hearings (UFO)
17 May 1961

AFOIN-4B (Colonel Evans)
1. On 17 May 1961 Major Coleman, SAFOI-3, called and informed me that the pressure case was on for a congressional hearing on unidentified flying objects. He indicated that it was the opinion of SAFLI that we would be before Congress prior to December 1961.
2. Major Coleman stated that most of the present pressure was from Congressmen Downing of Virginia, as evidenced by a nine page letter from the Congressman which requires a paragraph by paragraph answer.

Director, NICAP

Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

I have read with interest the copy of your letter to Chairman Overton Brooks including suggested "hearing plans."

Perhaps I have been misled in this whole business of UFO. However, I was informed this was your organization and others were prepared to prove this during the course of the hearing. And further that UFOs were not merely the result of optical or atmospheric phenomena, but actually were craft (of sorts) from other planets.

I was sadly disappointed as I read your proposed plan, suggestions and viewpoints. I cannot help but feel that your letter is tailored to reading, with the least possible publicity, you seek, and thereby cause the U.S. public to lose consciousness of this important information you seek, including such information that may well involve our national security. I too am impressed by unnecessary secrecy. However, unnecessary or unwarranted secrecy is no more than a matter of degree and secrecy may well be called for. I would urge you to exercise your judgment and weigh all the facts, in all probability withhold from the public, knowledge not considered "secret." I repeat - I have opposed and will continue to oppose unwarranted secrecy.

Your letter to Chairman Brooks (including your proposed plan) concerned itself almost totally, in my opinion, with evident dislike and malicious attack toward a great branch of the military. In fact, it sounded to me like nothing more than a cheap service rivalry. Now I hasten to add that I could be wrong, but I have said many plans and proposals in my day and must say I recognize a little prejudice and/or dislike when I see it. If you do not in a position to "make a case," and your letter, as I read it, indicates that you are not even in a position to be accepted in holding hearings. This I thought to be your purpose. Certainly I'm

Unidentified Flying Objects

TD-E (Colonel Wynn)
1. On 15 November 1961, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, consultant to the UFO project, and Major Robert J. Friend, TD-E, appeared on the Wayne State University TV program "Unidentified Flying Objects". The program was a special presentation on the work of the United States Air Force's unidentified flying objects program. Another show, conducted in the manner of the Miss Wallace interview, was also taped for showing at a later date. The appearance of Air Force personnel on these programs was the purpose of the exhibits and resulted in approximately 1,000,000 viewers.

2. Regarding the proposed Congressional hearing on the USAF UFO program, Major Friend advised that General LeMay, Chief of Staff, USAF, that Congressman Grover Bates, Chairman of the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee, had informed him in a telegram that the hearing would not be held. The events which led to the decision that the hearing would not be held will be furnished in a story in a writing by the so-called "Insider" which resulted in a definitive public interest.

3. As a result of the indicated public interest, Mr. Robert J. Friend, Major, USAF, director of Project Blue Book, and Major Donald E. Keyhoe, director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, presented the Air Force view, and Major Keyhoe presented the views of his organization. Major Keyhoe's scheme to discredit the United States Air Force would not be a part of Major Keyhoe's cheap scheme to discredit the United States Air Force, and that those would not be hearing.

not interested in listening to headline making accusations (prompted it seems by past gripes) in open debate between you and the Air Force.

It was my every intention to have the Air Force and organizations of good repute assume the actual role in getting to the facts of this apparent incident in behalf of the public (and I might say - I'm not worried about public clamor - I'm much more concerned about considering and answering thoroughly any serious scientific questions which are WHAT COULDN'T BE ANSWERED BY ANYONE - the Air Force or NICAP.
It's exposive to continue out this line under you wouldn't be answering many questions if any - you'd just be asking them - Anyone can make somebody side look bad under those conditions and I am not a captive of charges unless.

As I have said, I suffered extreme disappointment as I read your plan. Talk about secrecy? In paragraph A of your letter to Chairman Brooks, you propose the Air Force representatives will be directed by the subcommittee to answer all of NICAP officials' questions in regard to specific Project Blue Book findings, reports and the business of the Air Force in this matter.

However, in paragraph B of the same letter you propose "...and the NICAP representatives will answer fully to you regarding names and certain details in their possession, (Emphasis added). That kind of secrecy - keeping from the public and from NICAP certain facts that may be in possession of the Air Force because it is confidential (secret)? Oh, my. I have also heard that the Air Force may withhold names similarly, where witnesses are concerned on this, and other relevant unimported points are in keeping with the main question before us as I apparently understand it.

Personally I don't feel I need to elaborate on the generosity you equivocated to your dealings in paragraph A, however, no one interested in justice could remain completely. First of all, what witness honestly interested in the security of this nation is going to insist to the Air Force he remain anonymous? (Or your organization for that matter). Secondly, you generously consider the Air Force the privilege of withholding evidence, facts, which may bear directly on the issue? Very generous indeed - as if you have information which the Air Force is keeping secret, but does not serve national security, I suggest you release it to the newspapers. They'll love it.

Honestly and sincerely, I take this confession (before I had received copies of your letter (and same) to Chairman Brooks, I was utterly astounded by the conviction you had on UFO's and the assistance you might give to the Committee. You dispelled any hopes I had relative thereto in the language heretofore.

Congressional Committee Staff Member Visit
20 AUG 1961

1. Mr. Richard F. Hines, staff member of the House Science and Astronautics Committee (Congressional Committee), visited ATIC on 14 and 15 August 1961. The purpose of Mr. Hines' visit was to gather background information on the Project Blue Book (UFO) program.

2. Project Blue Book (UFO) has been an active Air Force project since 1947. The data being collected is to determine (a) if unidentified flying objects are a threat to the security of the United States, (b) if the many sightings can be explained, (c) if the project should be continued or concluded. The directives which are sponsoring the project were issued in September 1952 and JANAP 146, dated February 1958, requires analysis and evaluation of reports regarding UFO's. The office of the Secretary of the Air Force is responsible for conducting the project. The office of Legislative Liaison is responsible for handling all congressional contact in this program.

3. Mr. Hines was thoroughly briefed on our method of conducting the program and collecting the data on reported sightings. He has indicated that his analyses have resulted in the conclusion that over 90% of UFO sightings can be explained. He visited some of the facilities at the Aeronautical Systems Division which have been utilized in the program. Mr. Haldeman, from this Division, and Mr. Valare Burt, consultant to Project Blue Book (UFO), was present and assisted with the briefing.

4. Mr. Hines indicated that Congressional interest in the UFO program resulted from inquiries from constituents which were brought to the attention of members of Congress. Discussion resulted in the collective opinion that Major Donald E. Keyhoe, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired), and present Director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, a private UFO organization, was probably behind this effort. This opinion is substantiated by the fact that Mr. Keyhoe has been extremely active in making public statements regarding UFO's and this program.

facts that Major Keyhoe was behind previous efforts which resulted in Congressional briefings during August 1958 and July 1960; that present NICAP leadership charges to write to their Congressmen and request that there be a hearing on UFO's and that Major Keyhoe has, on his many television and radio appearances, spoken out for Congress - 
5. It was indicated that Congressman Joseph E. Karth, Minnesota, will be the chairman at the hearing. The hearing will last approximately five days for testimony of witnesses and the last day for an executive session. The Air Force will be required to provide witnesses, and I understand Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the Air Force's consultant, and Major Friend is the project consultant and Major Friend is the present chief of the Aerial Phenomena Branch.
6. Mr. Hines indicated he was favorably impressed with our handling of the Dewitt, Michigan case and felt that further assistance which he might need in preparing for the hearing. He also indicated that it was designed to acquaint Congressman Karth prior to the hearing, a view with which Mr. Hines readily concurred.

Dear Bob:

We have finally returned from the wars to home base. The trip back was a bit wearisome and accompanied under considerable tension since my youngster developed a splendid case of tonsillitis which drove his temperature to 103 and better. As you can imagine this can be quite trying, but fortunately we found a Doctor who promptly shot the little lad in that well known area with penicillin. This did the job and he is now as chipper as a squirrel.

Please accept my thanks, Bob, for your unstinting assistance and help during my stay in Dayton.

I have not as yet had an opportunity to discuss with Mr. Karth the results of my trip, but I am certain that previous decisions have not been changed. Today the Chairman confirmed his previous decision that hearings will be held on UFOs during this session of Congress and no specific date can be set for this as yet.

You and I breathe a deep sigh of relief. However, as you can imagine, the "planifies" have begun their clamor, stimulated by notices in the press of our committee's interest in UFOs.

If anything new develops I shall let you know.

Sincerely yours,
