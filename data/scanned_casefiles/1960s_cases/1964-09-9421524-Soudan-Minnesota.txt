SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR SEPTEMBER 26, 1964

Jupiter Joins Saturn

Jupiter, shining brightly in the constellation Taurus in the east, and Saturn in Aquarius to the south, will be visible in October evening skies.

By JAMES STOKLEY

► WITH THE COMING of October we have two planets joining the stars of the autumn evening.

To the south, in the constellation of Aquarius, the water carrier, stands Saturn. And in the east, about 15 times as brilliant, you can see Jupiter in the constellation of Taurus.

Star maps show the sky as it looks about 11:00 p.m. you find of daylight saving time, at the beginning of October—an hour earlier at mid-month and two hours earlier at the end.

The "great square" in the constellation of Pegasus, high in the south, is an outstanding grouping, although it contains none of the brightest stars that astronomers call first magnitude. The star Markab is in the lower right-hand corner and extending from it to the right is a row of stars that marks the head of this mythical winged horse.

Just underneath these stars is Aquarius, now more conspicuous than usual because the planet Saturn is moving across it. To the right of Aquarius is Aquila, the eagle, with Altair, above this group a bright star Fomalhaut, in Piscis Austrinus.

Most of this constellation is shown on the northern sky map, including the brightest star, Deneb. Below it is Lyra, the lyre, with brilliant Vega.

Andromeda in Northern Sky

High in the northeast is Andromeda, said to represent a chained princess, a constellation extending from the star Alpheratz, which is in the upper left corner of the square of Pegasus. Andromeda's mythological mother, the queen Cassiopeia, is just below. Her royal spouse, the king Cepheus, is to the left of Cassiopeia. And below him stands the little bear, Ursa Minor, which points its pole star.

Ursa Major, the big bear, of which the big dipper is part, is now poorly placed for viewing. It is very low in the north, and some of the constellation is hidden below the horizon.

Low in the east (shown on the map of the northern skies) is Taurus, the bull, in which Jupiter now stands and shines far more brightly than any other star or planet. Mercury is also in this part of the sky near Aldebaran. To the left of Taurus is Auriga, the charioteer, with first magnitude Capella.

Above Auriga is Perseus, representing a champion, with the star Algol, a famous "eclipsing binary." Actually it is two stars.

Mule carrying two water barrels, or simply a water bucket.

Of course, the constellation figures, it is hard to see this in the stars. The water jar, however, was supposed to be represented by the three stars quite close together that are shown on our map a little to the right of the water jar, extending down from the jar forms the stream of water that flows, very appropriately, toward Piscis Austrinus, the southern fish.

Very curiously, however, the fish is not swimming in the water, as you might expect. Another watery constellation is just to the right of Aquarius: Capricornus, the horned goat. This creature is represented as the horned head of a goat attached to the body and tail of a fish.

Aquatic Animals in Patterns

A little higher, marked by only one star on our map, is Equuleus, the colt. Dr. Donald H. Menzel, director of the College Observatory, suggests that this is really a sea horse. There are two other sea animals on the map, the faint constellation of Delphinus, the dolphin, still another aquatic animal. And to the left of Aquarius there are more. There is Cetus, the whale, and Pisces, the fishes, which are tied together according to the pictures on old star charts.

Even Grus, the crane, near the southern horizon, has a connection with water, for the crane is a wading bird.

FIELDS

ASTRONOMY
Stellar Pair in Dipper
Found to Be Seven Stars

> THE FAMOUS PAIR of visible stars in
the handle of the Big Dipper, Mizar and
Alcor, has now been found to consist of
seven stars.

The ability to distinguish the faint companions of Mizar, a bright star widely used as a test of normal vision before
the days of eye glasses and oculist's charts,
has been improved by Wallace R. Barclay
of the University of Pittsburgh, Observa-
tory. Using a new electronic image-tube
camera, he has been able to separate the
two stars, called Mizar A and Mizar B,
and Mizar A has long been known to be
double.

Now Wallace R. Barclay of the University of Pittsburgh's Allegheny Observatory, Pittsburgh, has found that Mizar B
consists of a pair of stars revolving around
each other every 182 days, with a third
companion orbiting the pair in 1,950 days.
Details of Mr. Barclay's study of this seven-starred system are reported in Sky
& Telescope, 28:131, 1964.

ENGINEERING
New Twist for Maps
With Old Instrument

> A 65-YEAR-OLD INSTRUMENT can
make the task of mapping an area much
simpler—at least in theory.

Ohio State University engineers, under
the direction of Prof. Ivan J. Mueller, department of geodetic science, have been
investigating new uses for the torsion balance, an instrument given up 30 years ago
as useless in map making. Their findings
have brought the torsion balance from laboratory into new prominence.

The instrument is now a more sensitive device that, instead of measuring distances between two points, measures the
local gravitational field. A weight, attached to a fine wire, "twisted" under a
precise electronic control, measures the
degree of gravity in different areas of the
local gravitational field. A weight, attached to a fine wire, "twisted" under a precise electronic control, then released, prevents using trigonometry to find the distances between the points.

rate and tedious computations must instead
be used.

The location of points on earth from
star observations—technique used by
Renaissance ships at sea to keep from "sailing off the edge of the world"—depends
with these triangulation distances. From
this data and a myriad of corrections factors "scales" are established to get different
distance sights on the "projected"
charts. The process involves a long
draw-out process with a few simple twists
of knobs. The only drawback to using the
torsion beam balance in map making is its
extreme delicacy and sensitivity to locally
"irregular" gravity fields.

BIOTECHNOLOGY
Doughnut-Like Device
Aids Circulation Study

> NEW CLUES to heart attacks, strokes
and other critical heart and brain problems
may result from research with a doughnutshaped electronic device smaller than an
aspirin tablet.

The device, which electronically
measures blood flow through arteries as
small as four-hundredths of an inch in diameter, was designed to determine how
much is delivered to vital centers in the
body.

By placing several of these devices around
different heart arteries at the same time, researchers have discovered that the heart's
arterial tree is not uniform, as has been
assumed by many investigators.

This knowledge makes possible advances
in prevention and treatment of heart attacks
involving arterial obstructions that block
delivery of blood to heart muscle.

The device permits blood flow to be
small animals such as rats and dogs. Previous blood flow studies have been done on
expensive animals, thus slowing down investigations.

The same techniques have been used to
study the flow through arteries supplying
the brain, kidneys, and other vital organs and various drug have been recorded
in conscious, freely-moving animals.

Arteries can be visualized by X-rays
probed with catheter and studied with
radioactive tracers. But these procedures have revealed limited information about
the circulation of drugs in the body.

The research is headed by Drs. Alexander
Kotin and Gordon Ross, University of California, Los Angeles.

PUBLIC HEALTH
Portable Device Speeds
Testing for Diabetes

> A PORTABLE DEVICE in mobile
clinics is enabling people in Cleveland,
Ohio, to find out—in eight minutes—
whether or not they have diabetes.

The device, which tests the blood for
a solution of known concentration, then
measures the resulting blood-sugar index.
Dr. Jack R. Leonards of the School of
Medicine, Western Reserve University,
Cleveland, developed the apparatus.

ASTRONOMY
Comet Rediscovered,
Unseen for 58 Years

> A COMET that has not been seen for
58 years has been rediscovered, due to
the work of Elizabeth Roemer of the
U.S. Naval Observatory, Flagstaff Station,
Ariz., used the 40-inch telescope there to
locate Comet Holmes.

She rediscovered Comet Holmes on the
basis of accurate positions predicted by
Brian G. Marsden of Yale University Observatory, New Haven, Conn. Comet
Holmes was first seen in 1892. It was also
observed in 1899 and 1906.

The comet has a low physical activity as outbursts when it draws close
to the sun, as it is doing now. It is in the
constellation of Capricornus, the horned
goat, which is now in the southern sky.

News of the rediscovery of Comet
Holmes was telegraphed to astronomers by
the International Astronomical Union,
Mass., the clearing house for astronomical
information in the Western Hemisphere.

ENGINEERING
New Suspension Bridge
Fourth Largest in World

> THE LONGEST suspension bridge in
Europe, and fourth largest in the world,
has just been completed. Called the Forth
Road Bridge, the first three being in the United States,
last opened in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Called Forth Road Bridge, it has 30,000
miles of mild-steel wire holding up its
roadway, with a 3,300-foot central span.

PHYSICS
Wave Analysis Locates
Plane Crash in Lake

> THE POINT OF IMPACT of a jet airliner that crashed into Lake Pontchartrain,
La., last Feb. 25, was calculated by looking
at the waves it made, and then tracing them
back to their origin—method that may
prove useful in similar cases in the future.

David E. Armour and Steve Nesbytka of
Louisiana State University used oceanography figured that the plane would
have caused a two-inch-high wave in the
640-square-mile lake.

They checked the recorded graphs produced by four tide gauges located on the
lake during the period immediately following the crash and found a wave within
the point of the crash within 1,200 feet of
the actual location of the wreckage, which
had already been spotted by conventional
methods. The study was reported in Science,
145:921, 1964.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

These do not exhaust the inhabitants of the celestial sea. East of Cetus (not shown) on the map, but visible later in the night) there is the long, Waddling constellation of Eridanus, the river.

Still further to the east is the water monster, Hydra.

Further south in the sky, not visible from the U.S., is the great ship Argo, so huge that astronomers divide it into four constellations. These are Carina, the keel; Puppis, the stern; Vela, the sails; and Pyxis, the mariner's compass. Still more southerly are Volans, the flying fish, and Dorado, a fish.

However, these are not really ancient constellations. They were added to the sky in 1603 by Johann Bayer, a German astronomer who published a book of star maps and filled in some of the blank spaces.

It is hard to believe that only coincidence accounts for so many watery constellations. Perhaps their origination intended them to picture some great water journey. If so, man kind has forgotten what it was.

OCEANOGRAPHY

New Ocean Sounder
100 Times More Accurate

> AN OCEANOGRAPHIC SYSTEM capable of mapping the ocean's floor to a depth of nearly seven miles, with 100 times the accuracy of previous systems, has been developed.

The new system uses an ultra-narrow rectangular sound beam only two and two-thirds degrees wide, instead of the 60-degree wide beam used in older systems.

In these systems the "echo" from the bottom of the ocean may include both peaks and valleys. The actual depth beneath the survey ship thus can be only roughly measured. The narrower beam enables oceanographers to "pinpoint" an area of the ocean's floor and to obtain a far more detailed map.

The General Instrument Corporation's Harris Division, in Westwood, Mass., developed the system.

Nature Note
Deadly Nightshade

ATROPA BELLADONNA, the so-called
"deadly nightshade", is a tall, poisonous
herb that grows to a height of one or five
feet and is found growing wild in eastern
United States.

A member of the Solanaceae family, it is
related to the tobacco plant, the horse-nettle,
and the potato. Solanurn halesworurn, which
resembles it, appears...

A native of Central and Southern Europe,
this plant was imported to this country for cultivation as a source of atropine, a poisonous crystalline alkaloid that
occurs in the plant's roots and leaves and
is used in medicine.

Atropine is most commonly taken internally in large
doses. It is most common uses are as a relief
for intestinal cramps and as pupil-dilating
"eye drops".

At one time atropine was used by ladies
of the court to dilate their pupils in order
to enhance their beauty. This was one origin
of the name belladonna, which literally
means "fair lady" in Italian.

Deadly nightshade (les contains the alkaloid hyoscyamine, which is found in all
parts of the plant, especially in its roots and
seeds. Deadly nightshade poisoning in
humans most commonly occurs from eating
the berries, which are shiny and black and
look like black cherries.

Two-UFOs Photographed

Taken from information received from photographer.

"The exact day the photo was taken is not remembered. It was, though, sometime during the first week of September, 1964.

We then lived at Black Hills Army Depot, Igloo, South Dakota. It was a very cloudy day with high winds, about 11 o'clock in the morning. My mother was looking out of the window when she sighted two objects. From the position of the objects above the trees, I would say they were about 15 degrees above the horizon. She then photographed the objects with a Brownie Hawkeye 620 camera. It was very stormy out, so she did not see the objects and does not know what direction they were traveling." - August Powell, Flagstaff, Arizona. (State Director HOUFO)

DATE: 6 September 1964         TIME: 11:45 PM
PLACE: Medford, Massachusetts

[Redacted names] were parked in an automobile along the upper Mystic Lake in Medford, Massachusetts when they observed a "bright royal blue" object carrying a reddish-white light more across the horizon from north to northeast. The intensity of the light was compared to that of an automobile headlight several blocks away and was steady. It was first seen through the windshield but was able to roll down his window in time to see it outside. The duration of the sighting was estimated to be 15 seconds. Several times along its path the object oscillated or moved in an erratic trajectory was flat and it disappeared from sight as it passed behind a hill. The apparent size of the object was compared to that of a dime or a nickel held at arm's length. Its true size was estimated to be 25 feet long. Estimated speed was 115 mph and distance about a mile from them. No sound could be heard. The object appeared to be solid. Its color was like a bright star. The weather dry and cool with scattered clouds.

EVALUATION:

I know of no aircraft that carries a royal blue light with revolving red lights. Its color, size and slow speed rules out a meteor. I believe Thomas and Anne probably witnessed something a UFO with blue-green color and a revolving red light. Neither had ever witnessed anything like it before. They had no idea what it could have been. Although lights in the sky can usually be attributed to aircraft, reflections of searchlights on clouds, meteors, etc. I felt that this report was very characteristic of UFOs. UFOs have been reported in this general area for the past several months.

MISSOURI FIREBALL OF 1964 SEPTEMBER 7
A.M.S. No. 2382

On this date in the early evening four fireballs were seen from central Missouri, and thanks to Dr. John E. Merrill, Director of Merrian Observatory, and our regional director Mr. E. E. Friton, 10 reports were sent in. Most fortunately, two of these had the plot of the last and apparently most brilliant fireball on star map, and in fact all the last ball of the reports referred specifically to this object, which appeared at 9:13 p.m., C.S.T. We know that all 4 fireballs started in the northeast and were seen by the observers, and it may be assumed with much probability that all came from the same radiant. Indeed, S3 saw the third, a very bright one, only 5 seconds before the one we are discussing. He gave the approximate path for this which would project back not far from the radiant here given. The observers were all in the area between longitude 90°W and 93°W and within half a degree of latitude 39°, some on each side of it. We have no reports from the region over which it began and ended. However, looking to other circumstances it is believed that the path is unusually well determined though based on only 8 or 9 reports. The path was almost N.E. to S.W. and not far from horizontal. The color was described as blue-green-white by different persons, the zenith magnitude was about -5, the reported duration about 3 seconds. It left a train which was visible at least 3 minutes, and which drifted in a SSE or S direction.

It also changed shape and expanded. This long-enduring train covered approximately 20° of sky. The observers were located at Louisiana, Mo., Mr. G. Aulbach at Martinsburg, S3, plotted the whole path which went right down Cygnus and began at Beta Cygni, Mr. R. L. O'Byrne, at Webster Groves, S10, plotted the last half of the path.

Both of these observers had intermediate points whose altitudes could be determined. Other observers gave good estimates for two it passed through their zenith. The solution of every fireball's path has special difficulties; in this case was that for the beginning point was needed an accurate cross line to two with S3 report. Not having this, the shape was determined by the altitudes of several intermediate points, though these proved unexpectedly consistent so the actual beginning point is not vital. Though the one chosen must be about correct. The usual data on path and orbit follow.

Martin Caidin Observes UFO

Aerospace author Martin Caidin was traveling twin-engine Martin Aztec B on the night of September 10th, 1964, at about 8:30 p.m. when he and friend Ed Keyes spotted an unang-colored UFO flying miles due north of Dodge City yard.

The cabin of their plane began to light up and "it was seeing things I shouldn't be able to see," Keyes, a former Continental Air Lines pilot, said.

"When I first saw it," Keyes said, "it was above a slight overcast. Tumbling action was the most significant aspect of the whole thing. It would slow down when it became flat with the atmosphere and would speed up when pointed downward. "This change in velocity was what caught my attention most," Keyes said.

When interviewed by the press, Caidin stated he'd seen a lot of meteors and other objects fall from the sky, including airplanes, but "to me this thing looked like an aircraft coming out of the sky." This was absolutely not a meteor. Ed described the object as a "circular mass."

Don Foulk, Air Traffic Controller for the FAA at Hutchinson, Kansas, said he received reports from several sightings. They came from a pilot over Pratt, Kansas, from one west of Hutchinson, from a pilot landing at Great Bend, Kansas and from a Hutchinson resident out in his back yard.

Foulk, who also saw the object at about 7-8 degrees east of due north from Hutchinson tower, said it was yellowish-orange. He said that by the way it was maneuvering, it was the final phase of the meteor. Others reported it as blue-green in color. Foulk said that direct contact with Kansas City, Missouri FAA offices brought reports from Columbia, Missouri.

Raleigh Lackey, meteorologist technician at Wichita, U. S. Weather Bureau Tower at Municipal Airport said the bureau had had reports from Concordia in Northern Kansas, Goodland to the northwest, Eureka, Kansas, 100 miles east and from FAA officials at Lincoln, Nebraska. The reports came from Goodland came from persons west of Hutchinson City who were sure the object fell just west of Pawnee, Kansas.

MRS. JOSEPH T. CHORNEY of Westford, and her son, STEVEN

Mother, Son Report UFO Sightings
Flying Saucers Seen Over Westford

Have you ever seen a Flying
Saucer or a UFO (Unidentified
Flying Object)?

A Westford mother and her 12-
year-old son claim they had two
sightings, the most recent being
on Sept. 15, and the first in
April, 1966.

Mrs. Joseph T. Chorney and
son, Steven, vividly recall both
experiences, which they say took
place in the Greater Lowell
area.

In her report to Westford, in
a typewritten statement dated

large ship—a very dark object
that appeared to be oval-shaped.
It had two very bright lights
alternately showing.

"It circled the area, then
hovered for a while, then came
down southwest of my home,"
Mrs. Chorney said. "About four
small objects appeared like red
lights that circled in the same
hours that same evening. They
returned to the large ship-like
craft (convening) were seen
in the Westford area about midnight.

A UFO occurred in April,
1966, and that experience she
reported:

"I saw a UFO on Concord
Road, Westford. The same year,
in October, my son Steven and I
approached the exact same ob-
ject in the same area about 150
feet above the ground. We
walked under it. It was very
large with eight large "picture"
windows on the bottom in a
row. There was light in the
windows that was very bright.

SAUCERS
(Continued from Back Page)

but it did not penetrate the
surface.

It was round, the window
with a flashlight, which reflect-
ed off the surface of the object.
It had a shallow scalloped edge,
dark shiny surface, with many
signs on the outer edge. We
observed this object for about
12 minutes.

"The lights went out, and it
left by moving itself in a
circular motion. We could hear
a slight whir coming from it at
that moment."

NO CASE INFORMATION ONLY, 18 SEP 64, ANSEDONIA, ITALY

Mrs Batt/DARCY/T2842/13 May 65
7 May 14 1965

Dear Miss [redacted],

Thank you very much for your recent letter and for the information you requested. I am glad to help you with the delay in answering, but I am sure you will understand that the work involved is somewhat complex. Just a few points which might help in evaluating the query reports received in this case in way that seems appropriate.

I am enclosing a copy of the current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects. This report gives the official position of the Air Force on this subject.

In 16 years of investigating over 9000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proved beyond reasonable doubt that all sighted, could be explained by astronomical conditions, or caused by optical illusion, hoax or by scientific activity.

There has never been any evidence that UFO reported to the Air Force were extraterrestrial vehicles. No such object reported to the Air Force has given any indication of a threat to the United States. Presence may perhaps be explained by some unidentified flying object characteristics beyond the scope of current scientific knowledge.

During the course of investigation 690 reports, 16 in 8 cases necessarily to meet air traffic, ballistic, missile, and testing requirements. We have found that most investigating officials and news media, it tends to extremely difficult for us to try to evaluate your report.

I have been in touch with the Assistant Air Attache from Italy. I am sending this copy of the following address with regard to your sightings:

Ministero della Eli Reali Aeronautica
Stato Maggiore Aereo
Via Colossei 4
Rome, Italy

It is only now that I have your address. I would like to inform you of the sighting of a luminous object by myself and two other persons near me, at about 10 p.m. (local time) on the 18th of September 1964, in the sky at Ansedonia (Orbetello), a cape on coast of Tuscany.

The egg-shaped object emanated an impressive, diffuse, dazzling, blue-green, jade light, with golden hues. It followed a brief path southward, came down for a time (it seemed to measure about three meters), then, always directed southward, rose again and paused about 5 seconds, leaving us astonished and shaken.

We do not think it could have been a celestial body or phenomenon, or a passenger plane.

I will try, at the foot of this letter, to sketch both the luminous saucer-shaped body we saw, as well as its trajectory.
[Signed]

Solo era vengo a conoscenza del Vostro indirizzo e ne approfitto per segnalare l'avvistamento di un oggetto luminoso,osservato da me e da altre due persone che vi erano vicino, il 10 settembre dello scorso anno 1964, alle ore 22 circa (ora locale), appresso nel cielo di Anselonia (Castello) - un promontorio della costa toscana.

L'oggetto, di forma ovoidale, era di mia impressionante, diffusa magliante luce acqua-verde-varie ciata, con delle sfumature locate. Esso apparve da ovest, seguì una breve traiettoria verso sud, si abbassò per un tratto (potrei calcolarlo di un tre metri, per le nostre vista) risalì e fermo per circa 5 secondi quindi, puntando sempre verso sud, sparì in una corsa vertiginosa lasciandoci compresi di ammirazione.

Escludiamo essere trattati di corpo celeste o fenomeno celeste né, escludiamo ancora, si trattò di aereo di passaggio.

Proverei in calce a tracciare uno schizzo o del corpo luminoso che volavano come un piatto, e della tratta: traiettoria.

24 September 64
Rio Del, California

Cigar Circles Calif. Town
Donald Martin, a lumberman, and his two daughters, as well as others in Rio Del (24 miles south of Eureka) watched a cigar-shaped object circle the town between 9:30 and 10:00 pm on Sept. 24, 1964. Martin, who used a power telescope to observe the object, was interviewed by an APRO member who prefers to remain anonymous.

Martin's two daughters were out using the telescope when they heard the "rumble". Martin himself heard no sound but said others in the community later said they had, including a schoolteacher and a man friend of Martin's.

The Martin girls watched the object through 2 "orbits" (from the northern horizon to the south and back again) and he (Martin) watched it through three. The object was at great height (Martin estimated 50,000 feet) and traveled faster than a plane. Martin saw two lights on the object, his daughters said it had one light on the front and three behind. Martin said he thought it could conceivably be a U-2 but didn't think any plane could move that fast. At one time it passed fairly close below the moon but there was no change in light intensity, indicating to Martin that it was not reflecting light but rather originating it.

A check of the Echo 2 sighting schedule at The Herald revealed that the satellite was not visible in the area and would not be seen again until 11:49 P.M. Sighting when it would have been visible was made earlier in the southeast.

The Stevenson boys' mother and sister also viewed the UFO was also visible at midnight.

Another Flying Object Seen ... October 9, 1964 ... Another UFO was sighted by two for human early Saturday morning by Ronald Cooper, 16, of 2 Belde Drive, and Jim Clark, 10, of Stone Spring House Road, who spoke of the size and brilliancy of a shooting star.

"We couldn't see its shape, but it was about like a shooting star, except it had a long horizon with its lights blinking and traveling laterally," Cooper said. "We watched it as it flew."

Observed at about 8:15 A.M., the UFO was believed to have been the fifth sighting reported here in less than a month.

"Snowflake" UFO seen, 3rd UFO in Week ... September 16, 1964 ... Several local residents last night reported sighting an unidentified flying object in the skies in the Warren vicinity.

Barry Lewis of Thawville said late last night that he and several friends observed the UFO through binoculars while standing at the corner of Walnut and Drake Street.

He said that through binoculars it appeared as a snowflake, with red lights around the edges. He said the object was seen periodically, and he believed that this was due to the rotation of the object. He said it appeared to change course often.

Last night's UFO report was the third received at the Herald this week. (Thawville Herald)

A few days later, we obtained a copy of "The Kane Republic" newspaper in Kane, Pa. in the issue of October 20th, a report highlighting in the Tinawille, Pa. area. (Credit Louis Winkler)

We wrote the Titusville Herald and received an answer from NICAP investigator William B. Weitzel, who was in the area making inquiries. He was kind enough to send us thermoluminescence data.

Another Unidentified Flying Object ... September 24, 1964 ... Another unidentified flying object was sighted last night by several Brook Street residents.

Charles Stevenson, 18, and his brother, Edward, 16, of 216 Brook Street, said they observed the object from the city and just above the horizon at 10:30 P.M.

Charles Stevenson said that when viewed through 30 power binoculars, the object appeared to be round with a cone-shaped top. He said that then red lights and a white light appeared and the object seemed to move. He said the object appeared brightly at first and red and white.

The youth said that by 11 P.M. the UFO appeared to be in the middle of the horizon and had moved out of the city.

Stevenson said he checked all of the planets listed in the World Almanac and could not see any of them in with the location and appearance of what they had seen.

"Boomerang"

At 4 a.m. on Wednesday, 23 Septem-
ber, South Bay residents reported
"boomerang" or "half moon" shaped
objects, moving rapidly across the sky
above the San Francisco Bay. By
Cameron or Walnut Creek workers
starting his paper route and he and some
workers at the Permanente Cement
Plant near Los Altos watched the objects,
said they were brightly lighted, glowing
intensely and fading alternately and ac-
cording to one observer they "blew up"
in the west.

Bath Township, Ohio

NORTHEAST OHIO

LOCAL SIGHTINGS - GREATER AKRON AREA - 1964

Date: November 28, 1964

At 8:15 A.M. a terrific burst of light illuminated the whole southern sky with a light whose color was similar to that given off by a mercury lamp. Considerable Harry Hood said the light was so intense that it illuminated the spot where he stood in Steuben.

There was 8/10 cloud coverage that night. The object came clearly through the clouds, causing a vapor trail which extended into the clouds. The object or light extinguished through a sort of horizon haze. The angle of observation was about 15-20 degrees. Duration was about 3 seconds.

ALSO SEEN NORTH

Summit and Portage Counties, and Fairport Harbor on Lake Erie reported illumination, but they did not see the meteor. County deputies saw the sky light up but did not see the checking reports of lights "like flares" in the sky.

Aurora, Ohio, Pt. William Russell got a good look at the object while he was on patrol on the morning of 216 A.M. "I was no more surprised than I was when I first saw it came down," he said. "I watched it until it disappeared behind trees." It was a blue-white bright illumination one of a flare. It sort of blinded me for a second. It was only 100 or 150 feet up when I spotted it. It was about as big as a car tire.

Editor's Comments:
Head and Pt. Russell were about 20 miles ENE and WNW of each other. The lines nearly coincide.

Dear Sir:

Please permit me to divert your attention from a busy schedule, for a few moments, to submit the following 'sighting' report. I will keep this report as brief but complete as possible. Should you desire further amplification of this letter, please feel free to contact me at my place of residence, as listed above, or at Radio Station W.E.V.E. in Eveleth,Minnesota, where I am employed.

The observation took place Monday, September twenty-eight, at seven-thirty in the evening, Central Standard Time. The skies were overcast. An occasional drop of rain was felt. I would judge the cloud ceiling to be at about two thousand feet. There was no wind at the time. The area of sighting was Skelton Lake which is approximately three miles Southeast of Soudan,Minnesota.

My first impression of the sighting was 'it' to be an 'Echo satellite' such as we have had the opportunity to view when the giant balloon satellites we orbit-and-months ago. The direction of travel was from South to North over the entire length of Skelton Lake, a mile or so beyond, in the same directions then it executed a one hundred-eighty degree turn, which I could not see and reversed its affection, traveling North to South, the length of Skelton Lake, at approximately it hundred ninety degrees, reading in an Easterly direction out of sight, over the tree tops. The object appeared to be circular in shape and lighted. Its rate of travel was steady and about that of a small plane. The entire sighting took place within the time interval of a minute.

Sincerely,

Attention: G.B. Smith
FL, RCAF

Dear Sir:

In response to your letter of October 7, 1964, I wish to amplify on information which I reported earlier pertaining to the sighting of an object in the sky.

I have enclosed a map of the area in which the sighting occurred. Also, on the map, I have inked the path of this object as I viewed it. My spot of viewing is marked with an 'X'. The dotted line marked 'Allen Track' is an abandoned railroad bed, used to transport timber out of the area in the days dating about the turn of the century.

I was returning from a hike down this track, from Putnam Lake to Swelton Lake, and around a portion of it to the spot which I marked with the 'X'. I had just sat down, under a pine tree, for a rest before continuing to hike at 159. The object in question came into view and traversed the path indicated. From where I was sitting, the object could best be described as a large pumpkin, lighted, and circular in shape. I would say that it was not more than 1500 feet from the Lake surface. There was no noise of any type, whatever, until it executed a 90 degree turn and headed in an Easterly direction. At the moment of the turn, I heard, what sounded to me, as the noise of some type of airplane engine, directly above it, in the clouds overhead. This was only heard during the ninety degree turn.

If first impressions are helpful, may I state them. When I first saw the object moving, the lake, I thought it to be an echo satellite. Then, I noticed that the speed of this appeared to be faster. (This was before the 180 degree turn was executed.) The rate of travel was constant. The surface of it appeared to have wrinkles on it much as a pumpkin has.

Please feel free to contact me should you wish further clarification.

Yours sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
