Case Date: 9-9-64

NARRATIVE:
On September 9, 1964, at approximately 7:00 p.m. CST, a bright white light was observed in the sky near Soudan, Minnesota, hovering over Lake Vermilion. The light was described as being round or oval in shape and approximately 100 feet in diameter. It remained stationary for about 5 minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view. Numerous witnesses reported seeing the object, which included local residents and employees of the nearby taconite mine. An on-site investigation was conducted by Air Force personnel, but no physical evidence was found, and the case was classified as "Unidentified".

JUPITER JOINS SATURN

Jupiter, in the constellation of Ophiuchus in the east, and Saturn in Aquarius to the south, will be visible in the evening skies.

By JAMES STOKLEY

AROUND this coming October we have two planets joining the stars of the night sky. These are Jupiter and Saturn.

Jupiter, in the east about 7:00 p.m., is now very bright. And in the east about 9:15 there is brilliant, yellowish Saturn, in Aquarius, the Water Bearer.

As the month goes on, the two planets will appear to draw closer together, until by the end of the month they are only about 4 degrees apart, appearing like a single bright object.

While they will not actually merge, they will appear one much fainter than the other. Every 2 years, 2 months the two planets go through this apparent close approach or conjunction.

At the time in the east about 7:00 p.m., Jupiter will be nearly overhead, shining even more brilliantly than Saturn. Around midnight, with Jupiter lower in the west, Saturn will be highest in the south, of the constellation figures but apparently they will appear separated by about a degree or even less.

The reason we say apparently they will appear separated is that their relative positions will really be determined by the line of sight. They actually will be millions of miles apart in the solar system. Their nearness is just an optical effect, as if you held up your thumb and forefinger a couple of inches apart and looked at distant mountains between them.

The southern edge of Aquarius lies just south of Saturn and the northern edge of Aquarius contains the star Sadalmelik, which was considered by some classical astronomers to be the "mouth" of the watery Aquarius figure.

Andromeda is in Northern Sky

High in the northern sky, Andromeda is ascending, said George Lovi of the Hayden Planetarium. Its brightest star Alpheratz, also called Alpha Andromedae, is now up in the northeast corner of the sky as darkness falls. To the left of Alpheratz lies Mirach. Below her royal spouse, the King Cepheus.

Just to the left, below Cassiopeia, is the compact star group of Andromeda, The large, bright star near the center is Mirach.

Use Mirach, the big bear, of which the stars are a part, to show nearly where the center of the Andromeda Nebula is located. This fuzzy patch of light, shaped like a fan, is one of the nearest major galaxies outside our own Milky Way.

Low in the east (Cygnus) the Northern Cross, with its brilliant first magnitude star Deneb, stands out brightly in the evening sky.

Aquarid Meteors

A little farther north. in Aquarius, is the radiant of the South Aquarid meteors, also called the Southern Aquariids. These are a minor meteor stream, peaking around September 1-5. Their normal rate is only about 10 per hour - but occasionally they produce some brilliant and unexpected fireballs.

According to the pictures on old star charts, Aquarius is an unusual mythological figure, a man pouring out a stream of water. Some astrologers have claimed this means Aquarius is a water bearer, but actually the figure represents a person swimming in the water, as you might expect for a water-bearer constellation.

Aquatic Animals in Patterns

A little farther south, in Cetus, the Whale, is a notable aquatic creature of the stars. This creature is represented as the monster who was supposed to devour Andromeda, until saved by the hero Perseus.

In the mythological lore, Aquarius, the Water Bearer, and Cetus, the Whale, are two of several aquatic animals and creatures in the patterns of the stars of the northern hemisphere sky.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR SEPTEMBER 26, 1964

FIELDS
ASTRONOMY
Strange Pair in Dipper
UNSEEN STARS EVER KNOWN
The famous pair of visible stars in the handle of the Big Dipper, Mizar and Alcor, has now been found to consist of two sets of double stars. This represents the widest known multiple system of stars.

The two stars visible to the naked eye actually compose a double star system - with components separated by the equivalent of a small telescope's field of view. Each of these components is itself a double star, forming a quadruple system.

Widely used as a test of normal vision before the days of eye examinations with charts, the ability to distinguish Alcor from Mizar has long been considered a sign of keen eyesight. The star of the Dipper's handle will never be used as an astronomical guide, however, because the two bright components are too widely separated.

Clyde W. Tombaugh, discoverer of the dwarf planet Pluto, finds that Mizar is also really two stars, called Mizar A and Mizar B. Thus the famous Mizar-Alcor system is actually a double star. Mizar and Alcor.

Now Wallace A. Eckert, formerly of the University of Texas at Austin, has completed an exhaustive study that indicates the Mizar-Alcor system may be even more complex. It now appears the two stars revolve around each other in a small but wide orbit, forming what is called a "wide double star" system.

In fact, Eckert reports that a total of seven revolving systems are reported in Sky and Telescope.

ASTRONOMY
Comet Rediscovered, Unseen for 58 Years
A COMET that has not been seen for 58 years has just been rediscovered, due to unusually accurate observations in recent years.

The comet, called 1949 III, has been missing since 1906. It is very faint, however, and is believed to have never been seen by the naked eye.

The comet was found by Dr. Daniel H. Harris of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and Dr. Brian G. Marsden of the Yale University Observatory. They reported their find in a telegram from Yale, dated Sept. 18, to the International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams.

The comet has a history of such physical observation problems since its discovery in 1849. The comet's orbit is extremely elongated, with a perihelion (closest approach to the sun) of only 0.33 astronomical units and an aphelion (farthest distance from sun) of 28 astronomical units.

This makes it extremely difficult to observe the comet for most of its orbit, and accounts for its long "lost" period. The clearing house for astronomical information is the Western Astronomical Union.

ENGINEERING
New Suspension Bridge
Fourth Largest in World
THE LONGEST suspension bridge in Europe, and fourth largest in the world, is now being built in the United States.

The bridge, which will be 14,260 feet long or 2.7 miles, is being constructed across the Strait of Mackinac in Michigan. It will connect the upper and lower peninsulas of that state.

PHYSICS
Wave Analysis Locates
Plane Crash in Lake
THE POINT OF IMPACT of a jet airliner that crashed into Lake Pontchartrain, La., last Feb. 1 was located by a new analysis of the wave patterns on the surface of the lake.

David I. Kennedy, a geophysicist at the University of Missouri, has used a new technique to analyze the wave patterns and deduce the location of the crash, which had been obscured by silt.

Divers checking the site confirmed the accuracy of Kennedy's analysis, which he carried out on the basis of measurements made by four wave gauges located on the shores of the lake.

There do not exhaust the inhabitants of the celestial car state of Ohio. they still continue to be seen as flashes of light, vortexes of light, and the like. These flashes and phenomena are seen in the sky, not visible from the ground, and often appear as if suspended. They are undoubtedly connected with the flying discs -- satellites -- these states. These are Carins, the keen flashing of light in the sky -- luminous, motionless, and often revolving -- Volans, the flying fish, and Domain objects. But these are not really ancient civilizations from Mars, Venus, etc. as some claim. They have a natural earthly origin, as can be seen from the writings of people who published a book of star maps and find it was done by the same inhabitants of the celestial car state of Ohio.

NEW GREEN SOUNDER

100 OCEAN MARE ACOUSTICS

A new system based upon the principles of mapping the ocean's floor by a depth-sounding technique, with the range and accuracy never before obtained.

The new system uses an ultra-narrow beaming acoustic energy pulse, aimed downward, from the bottom echo returns. In these systems the "echo" from the bottom comes from a very wide area -- much wider than the transmitted beam -- so that the bottom configuration can be only roughly measured. The new sounder uses a very narrow beam whose width can be of the order of 1 degree, so that the bottom can be accurately measured.

The new sounder also has a built-in stabilization system to compensate for the motion of the carrier ship, so that the system maintains its accuracy and resolution under all conditions of ship motion.

Nature Note
Deadly Nightshade
"TROPICALLY-DISTILLED DRUGS, the so-called
deadly nightshade, are being grown wild in eastern
Minnesota. The Soudan-Ely family, it is
reported, is using this plant for its drugs, in
place of the commercial and Northern-grown
variety. The deadly nightshade was imported to this
country for utilization in medicine, as it contains
the deadly belladonna alkaloid, used in the dilating
of the pupils of the eye, and for nervous system,
intestinal cramps and as a pupil-dilating
eye drug.
According to reports, the plant is being grown by
the citizens of the town to utilize their pupils-in-order
to dilate their pupils, we are told, in a peculiar
racial fad in Ely. The entire nightshade
plant contains the deadly belladonna
alkaloid, fatal to humans and animals, and
should never be used by laymen
except under close medical supervision.

THE FIREBALL OF SEPTEMBER 3:
1964, by Budd a. child, CUFOS Co-Chairman: 
The bright fireball seen over a wide area of California at about 9:30 P.M. on September 3, 1964, was, in all probability, the most spectacular astronomical event of the year. Seen from as far north as San Francisco to as far south as San Diego, and from the Pacific Ocean to beyond the borders of the State of California, this fireball was brighter than the full Moon and could be seen for over fifty miles. 
There has never been anything quite like it in the State of California. This was our best opportunity, we thought.

DATE: 6 September 1964
PLACE: Medford, Massachusetts  

TIME: 11:45 PM

DESCRIPTION: 
While driving along Upper Mystic Lake in Medford, Massachusetts, the witnesses observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) hovering over the lake. The object was described as being about the size of a small automobile, glowing blue with a pulsating light. As the witnesses continued to observe, the blue light was replaced by a reddish-orange glow, and the object then moved rapidly away at a high rate of speed. The witnesses stated that they could see the object clearly and that it passed directly overhead at a low altitude. The duration of the observation was approximately 15 minutes.

EVALUATION:
This sighting appears to be a valid UFO report. The description of the object and its observed behavior is consistent with many other UFO reports. The witnesses appear to be reliable and their account is detailed and plausible. The object was observed for a significant period of time, which adds to the credibility of the report. While no physical evidence was obtained, this sighting is considered to be of significant interest and importance.

The text describes the details of the reported sighting, including the time, location, direction of travel, and observations made by the witnesses.

The text found in the document is as follows:

MISSOURI FIREBALL OF 1964 SEPTEMBER 7 
A.M.S. No. 2382

On this date, in the early evening four fireballs were seen from central Missouri, and thanks to Dr. John E. Merrill, Director of Morrison Observatory, and our regional director for Missouri, 10 pages were devoted to describing the fireballs. This was forwarded to Mr. W.L.Webb, Chief, Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, WPAFB. Four people in several locations saw a fireball described as 1 1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the full moon, traveling northeast to southwest at 6:13 p.m., C.S.T. We know that at 4 fireballs started in the northeast as seen by the observers, and that all came from the same direction, though not simultaneously seen.
The path of the fireball was over 100 miles long, starting near the horizon in the northeast and going to a point near the horizon southwest of the observers. The observers were all in the area between longitudes 90Â°30' and 93Â°30' and on the north side of It. Based on only 2 or 3 reports, the path was almost N.E. to S.W. and not far from horizontal. The apparent motion as described as extremely rapid, faster than any aircraft. The body of the fireball appeared at times quite spherical at times elongated or irregular in shape, at times emitting sparks, and which drifted in a zig-zag or 8 direction. In about 1 minute the fireball disappeared. This suggests that the object disintegrated. No details as to shape, color or size, other than general estimates given. There were no sound effects reported. No residue or fragments observed. Radio reception was not affected. There are no photographs from this event, even though the beginning point was needed as an accurate cross line to use with 83 reports. Not having this, the size was determined by the attitudes of several intermediate points. A fair observation of the path and track taken can be obtained from the text, though the exact details may be nearly impossible to determine.

Martin Cairdin Observes UFO:
According to the text, Martin Cairdin, an air traffic controller for the FAA in Hutchinson, Kansas, reported observing an unidentified flying object (UFO) on September 12th, 1964 near Dodge City, Kansas. Cairdin stated that the object was high in the sky and appeared to be several miles in diameter. He watched the object for about five minutes before it disappeared to the north. The document also mentions that other people in the area had also reported seeing the object.

Martin Cairdin Observes UFO

According to the FAA at Hutchinson, Kansas, said he received several reports from pilots flying in the area on the night of September 12th, 1964, of what appeared to be a large object over Matthews, Kansas and Dodge City, Kansas. Martin Cairdin, an Air Traffic Controller for the FAA at Hutchinson, said he saw the object at about 7:15 P.M. on that date from a point about five miles due north of Dodge City.

Cairdin, who also saw the object at about 7:25 P.M. said he watched it until it disappeared to the north. He said the object was high in the sky and appeared to be several miles in diameter. It appeared to be round and seemed to be oscillating up and "it was seeing things." He said the object's speed was very slow, describing it as a "crawling" motion.

When I interviewed Cairdin, he said, "When I first noticed the object, it appeared to be tumbling with a rolling motion, somewhat of a wavering motion." He said that at one point it seemed to flatten out and would then take on a more rounded shape when it became flat with the atmosphere and would speed up to what appeared to be the speed of a jet aircraft.

Cairdin said his attention was caught when he noticed the object for the first time as he was coming in for a landing. He stated that he had sighted many meteors and has spotted many aircraft from all over the area, but "to me this thing looked differing, an aircraft coming out of the sky -- something rather unusual."

When interviewed by the press, Cairdin stated that he did see the object with his own eyes, and it was not just a reflection from airplane's lights. He described the object as a "circular mass."

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY) 15 Sept 64
SUBJECT: FLYING SAUCERS Mrs. JOSEPH T. CHORNEY, OF WESTFORD, AND HER SON, STEVEN - MOTHER - SON REPORT UFO SIGHTINGS
Flying Saucers Seen Over Westford
Have you ever seen a flying large ship - or UFO? This occurred here at Westford, April 14, 1964 with my son, Steven, and I as witnesses. We were outside looking toward the northwest from our home. The sky was clear and it was dusk, about 8:00 p.m. Suddenly we saw 3 large dark objects flying very fast across the sky. They were circular in shape, about three times the size of an airplane, dark in color, and absolutely silent. 

They were flying in a triangular formation, about 4000 feet altitude. We watched them disappear to the southeast. A few minutes later we saw 4 more of the same type objects flying in a straight line, about 5000 feet altitude, also going southeast. We saw these together for about 2 to 3 minutes.

About 10 days later, on April 24th, we saw 5 of the same kind of objects at about 8:15 p.m. They came in from the west at a high speed and went down in a northeasterly direction near our home. We watched them for 10 to 15 minutes as they maneuvered back and forth in the sky. Sometimes they appeared to be one object, then separated into 5 distinct objects.

On May 5th at 9:30 p.m. we saw 4 of these objects again. This time they approached from the west and flew low over our house, north to south, very slowly and silently. We could not hear any motors or any other sound. They appeared to be about 500 feet altitude.

This is a factual report of what we saw. We are very much interested in this kind of thing. We would appreciate any information you could give us regarding our sightings.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Mrs. Joseph T. Chorney
Westford, Massachusetts

NO CASE INFORMATION ONLY, 19 SEP 64, ANGPEDONTA, ITALY

Mrs Ratti/SAPPIGO/PHONE/13 MAY 65

Dear Mrs. X,

I am writing to inform you that we have completed our investigation of the sighting report you submitted concerning the unidentified flying object observed in the sky over Angpedonta, Italy on 19 September 1964.

In keeping with the general policy of Project Blue Book to inform individuals who report sightings of the results of our investigations, I am providing the following information:

As a result of our investigation, over 2000 reports of unidentified flying objects are received and reviewed each year. Comparison with past records indicates that the great majority of these are later found to be explainable as known or natural phenomena. Only a very small percentage remain unidentified after investigation.

The object sighted by you on 19 September 1964 appears to fall into the "explainable" category. There are no features of your report which would suggest the object was of extraterrestrial origin or which could not be accounted for by misidentification of a conventional aircraft, satellite, or other natural phenomenon.

Accordingly, I must inform you that the object sighted by you does not represent evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting our planet. The investigation of your report has been completed and no further action is contemplated.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to write.

Sincerely,

Ministero della AM 
Direzione Generale 
Servizi A.M.I.
Roma, Italy

It is only now that I have your address. I would like to inform you of the following: Object observed en the 18th of September 1954, at Anedonia (Orebello), a town on the coast of Tuscany.
Blue-green, jade light; with golden hues, diffuse, dazzling, followed a zig-zag path southward. It appeared (it seemed to me) to be motionless for a time (it seemed then, always directed southward), vanished on a steady course, leaving us astonished and shaken.
We do not think it could have been a celestial body or phenomenon.
I will try, at the foot of this letter, to sketch both the luminous sawyer-shaped body we saw, as well as its trajectory.

NO CASE (Information Only)
Source: 1. UFO Bulletin, Nov. Aug. 65

The narrative describes an incident where a lumberman named Donald Martin and his two daughters saw a cigar-shaped object in the sky over Soudan, Minnesota on September 24, 1964. The object was observed through binoculars and was described as a bright light on a dark object that was traveling at a high rate of speed. The report states that the object was not a star or planet, and that Martin's daughters said it looked like it could have been a U.S. satellite, but Martin himself didn't think any planes could move that fast. The report concludes that there was no change in light intensity, indicating that it was not reflecting light.

The text in the document is as follows:

The newsroom boys' mother and sister also viewed the UFO following the original sighting to The Herald at 10:45 P.M. 

Another Flying Object Seen - A bright white light appeared to the northwest about 10:30 P.M. Another UFO was seen by the same party who had seen the original object, and Jim and Dave Renz. Clark, St. Paul, an employee of the same sporting goods house, was about 3 miles southwest of Tower, Minn. observing the same object. 

He said it appeared to be a shining, flat, thin object, revolving at irregular intervals. Cooper said, "We watched it as it began to accelerate and suddenly it disappeared to the northeast."

The "Snowflake UFO" seen, 3rd UFO in Week - September 16, several persons reported seeing a bright light traveling at high rate of speed in the Tower-Ely area. Harvey Lewis of Tinsville said late last night that he and several friends observed a UFO traveling northwest through an opening in the clouds.

He said that through binoculars it appeared as a snowflake with four rotating arms. He said the object was in view about 15 minutes. This was the third reported sighting in the Tower-Ely area in the past week.

Last night's UFO report was the third received at the Herald (Tinsville, Herald) regarding sightings in the Tinsville, Pa., area.

RANDY from the Tinsville area stated that he and several friends observed a bright light moving rapidly northwest through an opening in the clouds. He said the object was seen for about 15 minutes.

SHERIFF Leroy Elliott and Jim Renz, both of Tower, reported sighting an unidentified flying object over the Tower area on September 18. Leroy Elliot said it appeared to be a shiny, flat, thin object revolving at irregular intervals. The object was visible for several minutes.

"NORTHEAST OHIO 
LOCAL SIGHTINGS - GREATER AKRON AREA - 1964

29 September 1964

Badin Township, Ohio

On 29 September 1964 at about 8:00 PM, a man and his family were outside their home in Badin Township, Ohio, when they noticed a bright light in the sky. This light illuminated the whole area and appeared to be larger than a star. It was hovering about 500 to 600 feet in the air. This light was described as bluish-white in color and was visible for about 10 minutes. It then moved away to the east and disappeared. 

The witnesses stated that the light seemed to illuminate the spot where it was hovering. They also related that it made no sound at all.

ALSO SEEN NORTH

Lake Erie - Several Cleveland businessmen reported illumination over Lake Erie but did not see the source. They saw a bright glow over the harbor but the objects themselves could not be seen.

Aurora, Ohio - A woman living about 20 miles ENE of Cleveland heard a humming sound and then saw a bright, blue-white light about 30 degrees above the horizon. This light remained stationary for approximately 15 minutes and then rapidly moved to the east and disappeared.

Colonel Mack and Pfc Russell were about 20 miles ENE of Cleveland at the lake when they observed the light phenomena."

Attention: Commander O.J. Lawrence, USAF
Director of Installations
Dear Sir:

Please permit me to divert your attention from a busy schedule, for a few moments, to submit the following "sighting" report. I will keep this as brief as possible and hope you will contact me at my place of residence, as listed above, so that we may discuss this matter further.

The observation took place Monday, September twenty-eighth, at approximately 5:30 P.M. central daylight time. The witness, Mr. -- -- -- ---, who resides at Soudan, Minnesota, observed what appeared to be an unusual object in the sky. There was no wind, and the object was perfectly motionless. The object was shaped like two saucers placed face to face, and it was approximately fifty to sixty feet in diameter. There was a lighted, circular area on the upper surface, which is best described as a "glowing" light. This light appeared to pulse or throb at irregular intervals of from thirty to sixty seconds.

My first impression of the sighting was that it was an "echo" pattern of some sort, such as might be encountered on the scope of a radar set. However, after watching the object for several minutes, I became convinced that this was not the case, as there was no corresponding movement of the object, nor was there any indication of rotation or vibration.

The color of the object was a dull, metallic gray, and it appeared to be suspended in the air at an approximate altitude of one thousand feet. After observing the object for about ten minutes, it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from view.

Sincerely,

Attention: G.B. Smith
PFRGAP

Dear Sir:

In response to your letter of October 7, 1964, I wish to amplify the sighting of an object in the sky. 

As soon as I received the report of the area in which the sighting occurred, also on the map, I have tried to get the background of this object in view. I reviewed it carefully and found the reported details which are found in the enclosure.

The object was seen by quite a few people out of the area in the days dating about the turn of the century. It continued until nearly morning in some of the reports, and just sat down, apparently to rest on the pine trees. This was repeated on about 8 occasions, I am told.

With the continuing daily occurrence, it was felt by some observers that there was an object which could not be accounted for as any particular plane, dirigible, or other conventional object. Its aerial maneuvers did not seem any type of ordinary aircraft. It was described as a circular object, metallic in appearance, varying in size from about 40 to 60 degrees in diameter. It made no sound and hovered in an easterly direction. At the moment of observation, a brilliant light appeared to come from the object which illuminated all the area around it. This was only heard during the ninety degree turn.

If the object I mentioned in my original letter was similar (although I can't be certain), I saw the object moving over an area quite some distance away in a west to east direction. Its diameter appeared to be 1/4 to 1/3 the size of the full moon, and it gave off an eerie, glowing light. This was before the 130 degree turn was executed. The speed was about that of a small jet. While I was observing it, the object appeared to stop momentarily, then executed a very sharp 130 degree turn and continued on in an easterly direction at a high rate of speed. This was certainly no conventional aircraft.

Please feel free to contact me should you wish further clarification.

Yours sincerely,

[Redacted]
