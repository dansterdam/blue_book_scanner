Memo, AFCIN-4E, 23 May 61, Radar Analysis
1st Ind (AFCIN-481a)                                                6 Jun 61

TO: AFCIN-4E (Major Friend)

1. Subject report does not contain enough radar data for an analyses
   to be made.

2. The only reference to radar is in Item (B)(1) wherein it is reported
   that a total of 57 separate targets had been picked up on the radar scopes.
   Assuming that they are based on authoritative knowledge of the existence
   of such balloon devices, Maj. Busalacki's comments in Item (K) are concurred
   with.
