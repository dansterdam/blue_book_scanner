REPLY TO
ATTN OF: DCO

18 October 1968

SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: DFIC (TDETR)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. The attached report, AF Form 117, is forwarded for your information in accordance with AFR 80-17.

2. A check was made with Grissom Base Operations, Tower, and RAPCON to determine the air traffic during the period corresponding to the time of this UFO Report (2330 to 2355, 30 Aug 1968). One KC-135 landed at 2336 (036Gz). The active runway was '04' (040 degrees). There was no other air traffic during this time.

3. The location of this reported sighting lies to the south of the base, nearly in line with the end of the runway. The first reported sighting, at approximately 2330, closely corresponds to the landing time of the KC-135 and with the active runway pattern. The landing aircraft was reported. However, we cannot find any firm explanation for the second sighting.

This prompt begins at approximately 11:15 p.m. Friday evening, August 30, 1968. My wife, and our oldest daughter age 14 and a neighbor boy, age 16 were returning to Lafayette from Marion, Indiana on State Road 18.

As we crossed U. S. Highway 31, I first noticed a very bright light on the horizon directly ahead of us. At first I didn't give it a thought other than it was a tower beacon or perhaps an airplane. After several miles the light was still approximately in the same proximity. If it was an airplane it moved too slow and since there weren't any high objects along the road it wasn't a beacon light.

Finally I asked my wife if she saw the object, she did but couldn't figure it out. The children also saw it. About 3 or 4 miles west of the 31 intersection the object appeared to pass over our road in a northeasterly direction. At this point I said it looks like a plane looking for a place to land. . . So we followed it. We turned north on a gravel road hoping to pass close to the object.

We proceeded north for nearly a mile and saw the object heading east pass about a 1/4 mile ahead of us. By this time we all had formed some impression as to what we saw. Bright white lights like cabin windows with some amber lights and what appeared to be high density landing lights. The object passed behind a farm house and we hoped to see it again when we got past the house. It took us about 15 seconds to reach the spot where the object passed over the road and behind the house. When we got there - nothing. No lights, no noise, no nothing.

After considerable scanning of the sky we noticed an amber light moving away from us to the north. We stopped the car to wait and watch. The amber light didn't blink it was constant. Just when it was almost out of sight it turned west and shortly turned south. It was on a parallel to us moving fast. As it approached opposite us we listened and heard a faint humming noise. . . Like the hum of an electrical transformer or high voltage lines.

The object with the amber light turned west at this point. About three times the light disappeared then came back. After a short time we decided to continue our trip home as the light disappeared.

Back onto Road 18 heading west we had driven about 5 to 8 miles when the bright lights appeared again. This time closer than before heading east parallel to Road 18. Our guess is that it was about 300 ft. high and about 2 blocks to the north. Again we all had a chance to see the object and it confirmed our original impressions. White bright lights that seemed to form 3 or 4 windows. Brilliant this time with beams of light directed towards the ground with several amber and green beacon lights.

I turned north onto the first gravel road I could find in hopes of driving directly under the object. Unfortunately it wasn't a main road and soon narrowed down to one lane.

At this point I stopped the car, turned off my engine and lights. The kids and I jumped out quickly hoping to see the object pass overhead -- But again nothing. Only a few seconds we again heard the same humming, noise as before. Then nothing, no noise, no light, no object. This time we didn't even see an amber lights in the distance.


- page 4 -

The two sightings happened within 30 minutes of each other. We waited in darkness for awhile hoping to see the object again but it never showed.

In summary of this weird event the white lights that seemed to come from windows were too big and bright to come from an airplane cabin. The sky hardly without moving - too slow for either a jet or piston plane - Not enough noise for a helicopter.

Upon returning home each one of us without knowledge of what the others had drawn sketched what we thought we saw, they are attached.

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

NOTE: WE SAW THE OBJECT TWICE SAME PAT 1ST SIGHTING A+B 1ST SIGHTING A+B 2ND "

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
