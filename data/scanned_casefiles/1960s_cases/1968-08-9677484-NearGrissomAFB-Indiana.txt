As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

This report begins at approximately 11:35 p.m. Friday evening, August 30, 1968. My wife and our oldest daughter, ages 14 and a neighbor boy, age 16, were at our home in Markleon, Indiana on State Route 67.

As we crossed U.S. Highway 31, I first noticed a very bright light on the horizon slightly ahead of us. At first I didn't know if it was a power beacon or perhaps an airplane. After several miles the light was approaching us rapidly. It moved south to north and was much brighter than the normal headlights on automobiles.

Finally I asked my wife if she saw the object. She did but couldn't figure out the object. It appeared to pass over our road in a northeasterly direction. At this point I pulled into a small drive on the side of the road to land. As I did so, the object followed the road.

We proceeded north for nearly a mile and saw the object heading past us. It appeared to be about the size of the full moon, and had a halo formed some impression as to what it was. Bright white lights like cabin windows with some amber lights, and what appeared to be high intensity landing lights. The object paused behind a farm silo and was lost to view. It then appeared again and moved rapidly in a southeasterly direction and then east. It took about 13 seconds to reach the spot where the object passed over the road and behind the trees where we could no longer see it.

After considerable scanning of the sky we noticed another light moving away from us to the north. This appeared brighter and steadier than the earlier light. The amber light was still east. This light moved swiftly. About 2 blocks north, it gave a sharp turn and shortly turned south. It was on a parallel course moving fast. As it turned, I thought of an electrical transformer or high voltage line.

The object with the amber light appeared again at this point. About three times the light disappeared then came back. After a short time we decided to continue our trip home as the light disappeared.

Back once again on Route 67 heading west, we had driven about 5 to 6 miles when the bright light reappeared. This time it was lower than before heading west. I pulled over to the side of the road again to get a better view. After making a turn it continued on a northeasterly course and was lost to view.

I turned north onto the first gravel road I could find in hopes of driving directly under the object. Unfortunately it wasn't on the road and soon narrowed down to an impassable lane.

At this point I stopped the car, turned off my engine and lights. The kids and I jumped out quickly hoping to see the object pass overhead. But again nothing. The only thing visible was the same halo-type lighting in the distance as before.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed text document describing a UFO sighting event that occurred near Grissom AFB in Indiana.

Transcription of the text:

The two sightings happened within 30 minutes of each other. We waited in darkness: our watchful hoping to see the other but it never showed. 

In summary of this weird event the white lights that seemed to come from windows were too big and bright to come from an airplane cabin. The other plane - Not enough noise for a helicopter.

Upon returning home each one of us had thoughts of what we thought we saw, they are sketched.

The image contains a photograph of a questionnaire form used for reporting unidentified phenomena. The form includes a diagram showing the estimated trajectory of the observed phenomenon relative to the horizon.

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE ON THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA OR OBJECT THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. YOUR IDENTITY AND OTHER PERSONAL DATA WILL BE HELD IN STRICT CONFIDENCE AND WILL NOT BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF YOUR STATEMENTS OR CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION. RETURN TO AIR FORCE, ADDRESS INDICATED, FOR RECORDING AND ANALYSIS.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. The sketch depicts a road with some high trees and an approximate distance of 1/6 to 1/2 mile from a "FIRST SIGHTING AREA".

The image contains a compass rose diagram and two sketches or drawings. The compass rose diagram appears to be used to indicate the direction of the observed phenomenon, with instructions to place an "A" on the compass to show the direction. The two sketches or drawings appear to depict the phenomenon from different perspectives.

Text extracted from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. THEN DRAW A LINE CONNECTING THE TWO POINTS. THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B" THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS APPARENTLY STRAIGHT, CURVED OR 2IG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

The image contains a handwritten sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch appears to depict a UFO sighting, with annotations such as "Landing type" and "Silver chrome".

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

TO WHAT WAS THIS WHAT COULD BE SEEN, HELD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT, HOW WOULD IT COMPARE IN APPARENT SIZE? WELL, THIS OBJECT I WOULD SAY WAS ABOUT 5 TO 15 FEET IN DIAMETER FROM WHAT I COULD SEE OF IT. NOW THIS IS JUST A ROUGH ESTIMATE AS I WASN'T ABLE TO JUDGE IT ACCURATELY SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO COMPARE IT TO AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE STREET LIGHT IT APPEARED TO BE.
