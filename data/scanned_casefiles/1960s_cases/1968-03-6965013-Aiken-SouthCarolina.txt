THAT ONE SQUADRON WAS FLYING LOCAL FLIGHTS IN THE AIKEN-AUGUSTA

Dear Monday night, March 25 at 6:50 p.m. the U.F.O. was sighted on the area of Jackson's Gap, Alabama at 6:55 p.m.

The object was bright lights changing in color and seemed to be accelerating. After it reached a point where it could be seen through the fog, it left a red tail looking at it. We went to the area it was spotted in and we heard strange noises almost like static. Please send information at what you think about it.

The U.F.O. was spotted again the next night in the northwest.

P.S. Please send information.

A DC-9 FLIGHT FROM COLUMBIA TO ATLANTA. DUE TO THE HI OVERCAST AND HAZY CONDITIONS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE AIRCRAFT MIGHT HAVE STRAYED OFF COURSE SOME. THE OBSERVER DID NOT SEE TO BE SURE OF HIMSELF AS HE GAVE THE INFORMATION. CONCLUSIONS DO TO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION GIVEN.
I CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS NOT A VALID UFO SIGHTING, ALTHOUGH THE OBSERVER DID SEE SOMETHING. HE HAD BEEN IN THE AIR FORCE AS A RADAR OPERATOR AT SHAW AFB, SO HE IS RELIABLE. I FEEL NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IF REQUIRED.
