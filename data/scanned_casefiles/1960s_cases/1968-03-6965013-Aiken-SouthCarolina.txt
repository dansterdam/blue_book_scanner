Observer sighted a bright yellow light that disappeared to the south west.

COMMENTS: The reporting officer stated that a DC-9 flight from Columbia to Atlanta might have caused the observation. The observer was asked to complete a form 117 but refused. There is not enough descriptive material to really make any sound judgments on the cause of the sighting. The cause of the object, azimuth and elevation at the beginning of the sighting is not given.

[PHONE REDACTED]. COMMENTS: SHAW WING COMMAND POST

OPERATIONS AT SHAW AFB, S.C. WAS CONTACTED AND IT WAS ASCERTAINED
THAT ONE SQUADRON WAS FLYING LOCAL FLIGHTS IN THE AIKEN-AUGUSTA
AREA AT THE EXACT TIME OF THE SIGHTING. DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF
INFORMATION OBTAINABLE FROM THE OBSERVER I CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS NOT
A VALID UFO SIGHTING AND THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NOT
NECESSARY. I RESOLVE THE SIGHTING AS A CONVENTIONAL JET AIRCRAFT
PERFORMING LOCAL FLYING IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING.
