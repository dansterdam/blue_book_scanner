PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 13 September 1962
2. LOCATION: Newark, Ohio
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
4. DURATION: Unknown
5. OBJECT: Civilian
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
7. COURSE: Insufficient Data
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Metallic fragment found in burned pit, no other similar objects found in area. Physical analysis showed object to be related to local topography and considered to be of little significance. Object was never in upper atmosphere and was considered to be of limited processing.

The image also contains some handwritten notes at the bottom, including a case number.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, providing an analysis of a "total sample" that was subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis, with details on the major elements present and their relative amounts. The text describes the sample as likely being a "water material such as an iron-containing slag from a pyro-metallurgical process". The sample was also checked for surface radioactivity using a beta counter and a gamma-ray spectrometer, which showed some unusual readings about the radioactivity levels.

Analysis of a Total Sample
UNCLASSIFIED

A sample identified as a total sample, labelled and subjected to a qualitative and quantitative analysis and for radioactivity showed the following:

Major Elements Present:    Minor Elements Present (1)   Traces of Elements Present (2)
Fe                        Mg                         Ti
Al                        Zn                         Ni 
Si                        Ca                         Cu
                          Ti                         Cr
                          Ga

The analysis indicates that the sample is probably a water material such as an iron-containing slag from a pyro-metallurgical process. Also, some areas of the sample were slightly magnetic, while other areas were not attracted to a magnet.

The sample was checked for surface radioactivity with a thin-window beta counter and a gamma-ray spectrometer. Both of these methods showed that there was nothing unusual about the radioactivity count of the sample.

(1) Qualitatively present in amounts ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 per cent.
(2) Qualitatively present in amounts ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 per cent.

The image contains a photograph of an object that appears to be a rock or a meteorite fragment. The object is placed on a surface with a ruler or scale visible next to it, likely for size reference. There is no human face or identification visible in the image.
