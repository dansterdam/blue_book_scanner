SUBJECT: (U) Analysis of Metal Sample

TO: TD-3 (Lt. Colonel R. Friend)

1. Attached is the analysis of metal sample 3600-53-0000-8140. (U)

2. A review of the analysis indicates that the sample was never in the upper atmosphere and is more than likely a piece of "Walsing" from an iron reduction or steel production process. (C)

ANALYSIS OF A METAL SAMPLE
(STOCK NR 3500-68-C0002-L140)

A sample identified as a Metal Sample, Informed Fragment, was subjected to a qualitative emission-spectrographic analysis and its radioactivity checked. The results of the spectrographic analysis were as follows:

Major Elements Present    Minor Elements Present(1)    Trace Elements Present(2)
Fe                        Ca                            V
Al                        Mg                           Mo
Si                        Ni                           B
                          Co                           Cr
                          Ti
                          Cu
                          V

The analysis indicates that the sample is probably a waste material such as an iron-containing slag from a pyrometallurgical process. Also, some areas of the sample were slightly magnetic, while other areas were not attracted to a magnet.

The sample was checked for surface radioactivity with a thin-window beta counter and a gamma-ray spectrometer. Both of these methods showed that there was nothing unusual about the radioactivity count of the sample.

(1) Qualitatively present in amounts ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 per cent.
(2) Qualitatively present in amounts ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 per cent.

The image contains a ruler/measuring scale on the left side of the page, with markings visible. Next to the ruler is an irregularly shaped dark object or fragment, which appears to be a rock, metal piece, or some other physical specimen. The object is positioned to show its size in relation to the ruler's measurements. The image is in black and white and appears to be a documentary or evidence photograph.
