10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Green and white object size of baseball. No sound heard. Green oval-type light with a white light underneath, the green light occasionally changing to orange. Appeared, approx 15-20Â° above horizon, maintained same position. Appeared fm W and dived to hard ground of to right of observer, then climbed and disappeared to W. Observer estimated 6000-8000 ft on initial sighting with descent having magnitude less than maximum mag. 6000-8000 ft above ground, then disappeared at about

11. COMMENTS
Objt of this sighting was probably the Planet Venus. Planet was low on horizon at time of sighting, atmospheric refraction probably responsible for apparent increase and decrease in elevation. Color changes associated with sighting were due to dispersion. On date of sighting the planet was very bright, having magnitude less than maximum mag.

J. NO KNOWLEDGE THROUGH CONTROL AGENCIES OF TRAFFIC OR BALLOON RELEASES; HOWEVER, THERE ARE NUMEROUS UNSCHEDULED, UNCONTROLLED LIGHT PLANES KNOWN TO OPERATE IN THE AREA UNDER VFR CONDITIONS.

K. THIS REPORT WAS PREPARED BY MAJOR JACK H. CRAWFORD, A066414, 3560TH PILOT TRAINING GROUP, WEBB AIR FORCE BASE, TEXAS. MR. [REDACTED], WHO MADE THE INITIAL REPORT, AND MR. & MRS. [REDACTED] FATHER-IN-LAW AND MOTHER-IN-LAW OF MR. [REDACTED] WERE QUESTIONED REGARDING WHAT THEY SAW. ALL FOUR (4) PERSONS WHO SAW THE LIGHT WERE RIDING IN THE SAME CAR. THE SPEED OF THE CAR WAS NEVER BELOW 35 TO 40 M.P.H. AND MR. [REDACTED] STATED THEY ROLLED A WINDOW DOWN. HOWEVER, MR. & MRS. [REDACTED] STATED A WINDOW WAS NEVER

LOWERED. THE ROAD ON WHICH THEY WERE DRIVING WAS ORIENTED GENERALLY EAST TO WEST; HOWEVER, THERE WERE TURNS AND DIPS IN THE ROAD. MR. [REDACTED] DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WAS SEEN WAS FAR MORE IMAGINATIVE AND COLORFUL THAN THE OLDER COUPLES DESCRIPTION. STATEMENTS MADE BY MR. [REDACTED] AS FACTUAL WERE FOUND TO BE CONTRADICTORY AND IN ONE CASE FALSE. A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WAS MADE INCLUDING THE MIDLAND U.S. WEATHER BUREAU, THE MIDLAND FLIGHT SERVICE STATION, EL PASO FLIGHT SERVICE CENTER, THE 683RD AC&W SQUADRON, WEBB AFB, DYESS AFB, HOWARD COUNTY AIRPORT, BIG SPRING TEXAS AND MIDLAND AIR TERMINAL. FLIGHT PLANS, UNUSUAL RADAR PLOTS AND ANY UNUSUAL AIR ACTIVITY WAS CHECKED WITH THE ABOVE AGENCIES. THE ONLY ITEM THAT MIGHT APPEAR A POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE THE NUMEROUS CIVILIAN TYPE AIRCRAFT WHICH FLY

Here is the text from the document:

THROUGHOUT THIS AREA OF WEST TEXAS ON VFR UNCONTROLLED, UNFILED
FLIGHT PLANS.

THE MOST PROBABLE SOLUTION TO THIS SIGHTING WOULD BE THE PLANET
VENUS WHICH HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY BRILLIANT. THE MOVEMENT OF
THE AUTOMOBILE COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE APPARENT MOVEMENT OF THE
LIGHT AND THE THIN CLOUD LAYER COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE APPEARANCE
AND DISAPPEARANCE OF THE LIGHT.
