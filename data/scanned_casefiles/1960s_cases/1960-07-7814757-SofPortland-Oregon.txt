PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

CHEATHAM, A. M.

1. DATE: 6 Jul 60

2. LOCATION: S of Portland, Oregon

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 07/0522

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. PHOTOS: No

6. SOURCE: Civilian

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 45 sec

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two

9. COURSE: N

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Two objects the size of a half dollar at arm's length, round with flat top and round bottom. Luminous white, observed to change formation from file by side to a vertical formation. Traveled from 30° elevation due to 15° elevation in about 15 sec. No sound.

11. COMMENTS:
About 9:30 at night with a bright moon. Time for an a/c to travel a 90° arc is 20,000 ft in about 1 min. Witness probably observed 2 jet a/c at about this altitude (speed 600 kts). At this altitude the radar and green running lights are not visible and only the white solid light can be seen from the ground. It is difficult to understand how the witness knew the objects were flat on top. No evidence to indicate that this was not an a/c sighting.

12. CONCLUSIONS:
[Checkboxes for various possibilities, but no specific conclusion is marked]
