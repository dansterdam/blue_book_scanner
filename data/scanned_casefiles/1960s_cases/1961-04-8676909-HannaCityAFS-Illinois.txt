Memo, AFCIN-4E, 23 Apr 61, UFO Report (Radar)
1st Ind (AFCIN-4E1a/Mr. Bryant/sc/74201)
To: AFCIN-4E (Major Friend)
This office concurs in the opinion that the target probably was a balloon. The behavior of the target appears consistent with the behavior of a balloon. The report may point to the possibility of either low inflation of the balloon, or to a heavier normal load of instruments, etc.
