10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
At high altitude, object up to 
radar. Winds aloft at 97,000 ft on 
bearing 020 were 5. Clustered at 10,000 
ft. Radar scope showed object at 145 deg. 
Descent at 12 am rotation.

11. COMMENTS
Radar analysts believed object to be 
balloon. The behavior of the large 
(sized) rise of descent, and evident 
side movement all point to this 
conclusion, heavy appearance near the 
to either low inflation or heavy loss 
of the instrument package.

A SMALL VARIATION IN THE ANTENNA TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT OF THE OBJECT WOULD CAUSE THE OBJECT TO DISAPPEAR FROM THE RADAR INDICATOR, WHICH INDICATED THAT THE OBJECT HAD A SMALL REFLECTING SURFACE. AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, THERE WERE NO KNOWN AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA. L. NONE.

Memo, AFCIN-4E, 25 Apr 61, UFO Report (Radar)
1st Ind (AFCIN-46la/Mr. Bryant/jc/74201)

This office concurs in the opinion expressed in the basic message, that the target probably was a balloon. The behavior of the target (speed, rate of descent, and evident size of the target) all point to that type of target. Heavy appearance of the target might be due to either low inflation of the balloon, or a heavier than normal load of instruments, etc.
