UFO Observation, 7 November 1967

Pottstown Police Department
Pottstown, Pennsylvania 19464

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified Flying Object (UFO) report from Pottstown, Pennsylvania, which occurred on 7 November 1967, at approximately 7:20 am.

2. The witness stated that he observed an object that "looked like two saucers glued together with a strip of something in the middle." The object was observed for ten minutes and at one point was only 30 to 50 feet high and was hovering over a house.

3. The sighting occurred at 7:20 am, on Rhoads Road, and the observer stated that there was traffic on the road. Since we are not familiar with Rhoads Road, we would appreciate your opinion as to whether it is likely that traffic would not be on this road at what is usually the peak time for people going to work.

4. Did you receive any reports of unusual objects for this date? We would appreciate your comments as to a possible cause for this sighting.

5. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.

2. Request information on the following:

   a. In question 4 of AF Form 117, you indicate that there was no traffic on the traffic. By this, do you mean that there was no traffic on Rhodes Road during the ten minute interval? If not, what does it mean?

   b. How far away from your home were you? How is it that you observed the object for ten minutes and didn't call anyone else's attention?

   c. In your original letter you stated that you and Kevin Bender "have both seen many flying saucers." Yet, on the form you completed, you state that you had never observed a similar phenomenon before, please explain.

Mr. Quintanille,

In reply to your request of information for
AF Form 117, are the necessary answers:

2a. There was little or no traffic at all that interval
of time.

2b. I was in the living room at the time and called my mother

it was almost time to go to school.

at night or dusk and this was the first type like that
