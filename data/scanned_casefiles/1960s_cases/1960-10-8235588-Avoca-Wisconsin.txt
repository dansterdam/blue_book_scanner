Here is the text I can read from the document:

Commanding Officer of ATIC
Dayton, Ohio
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

[The rest of the body text is partially illegible, with only fragments of words and sentences discernible. The bottom of the page contains several black redaction lines.]

At the bottom, there appears to be a partially visible line that seems to read "Commanding [something]" but is mostly obscured.

Commanding Officer of ATIC
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

[The rest of the text is too faint or illegible to accurately transcribe. There are multiple paragraphs of text, but the image quality makes it difficult to discern the specific words.]

There are also three black redaction/censorship marks on the document - one at the top of the page and two at the bottom.

4 November 1960

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 24 October concerning the "nickel material" you found near Madison, Wisconsin.

This material is called window or chaff by the Air Force and is dropped from military aircraft to confuse ground radar readings. This is very difficult for the ground radar operator to explain to the average person. This type of maneuver is used during training missions and we have had some recently in the Madison, Wisconsin area.

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Lt. Colonel, USAF
