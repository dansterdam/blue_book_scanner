STATEMENT

At 0332, between Baltimore and Spartansburg, I observed a central apparently all my level on a celestial heading. It seemed to climb leaving very much the appearance of a comet streaming this odd shaped cloud. As it approached my 1030 position, I would see a very bright object of resembling very much the appearance of a comet streaming this odd shaped cloud. By 0400 it had reached my 0900 position and was very high (my altitude was 36,000 ft.). It then banged more in an easterly direction and became difficult to see in the rapidly twilight. I was flying a B-57E enroute to Tvndall AFB from Stewart AFB.
