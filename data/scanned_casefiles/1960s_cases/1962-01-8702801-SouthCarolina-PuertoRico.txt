Report on Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)

1. Description of the Object:
   a. Shape - Resembled a comet
   b. Size - Appeared the size of a bright star
   c. Color - bright white
   d. Number - 1
   e. Formation - N/A

   f. Tail or Trail - Streaming very similar to a comet at the vicinity of the object; however, the trail fanned out rapidly behind the object into what looked like a very large flounder shaped cloud which narrowed again into normal contrail some distance behind at a lower altitude.

   g. Unusual Features - Within the large flounder shaped cloud there appeared a point of light which grew in intensity until it became very bright with a large halo about 1t. It then decreased in intensity, but the halo persisted for approximately five minutes.

2. Description of Course of Object:
   a. When first noticed, the object was a normal looking contrail, level with me at my 1100 position coming toward me. I was at 36,000 ft, heading 240° MC.

   b. Angle or Elevation of the Object. The object seemed to be climbing, its maximum elevation was reached when it was in my 0900 position in the direction of Richmond, Va. I would estimate it to have been 20° above the horizon at this point. It then gave the impression of a turn to a more easterly heading so that it was continuing to climb directly away from me.

   c. Manner of Observation - Visual while airborne from B-57E, 55-4256, 36,000 ft, MSL, 240° MC, 420 KIAS from Stewart AFB, N. Y.

   d. Time and date of sighting.
      (1) 1/29/2330Z
      (2) Light conditions - twilight.

   e. Location of Observer - On a course between Baltimore TACAN and Gordonsville TACAN 70 NM from Gordonsville; observed for a period of 10 minutes.

   f. Identifying information on observer - Military, Ronald L. Widner, Captain USAF, 4713th Def Sys Eval Sqdn, Pilot.

9. Weather and Winds -

(1) CAVU, winds 290°/100K

(2) No significant weather activity or cloud cover in the area.

STATEMENT

At 0302, between Baltimore and Spartansburg, I observed a contrail apparatus at my level on a reciprocal heading. I seemed to climb leaving a very large pattern of what looked like the formation of a cirrus cloud.

As it approached my 1030 position, I would see a very bright object resembling very much the appearance of a comet streaming this odd shaped cloud. By 0402 it had reached my 0900 position and was very high (my altitude was 36,000 ft.). It then headed more in an easterly direction and became difficult to see in the rapidly fading twilight. I was flying a B-57E enroute to Tyndall AFB from Stewart AFB.
