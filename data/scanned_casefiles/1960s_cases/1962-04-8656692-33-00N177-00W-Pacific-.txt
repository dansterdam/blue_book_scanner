ENGLAND:
Whalley UFO

The blackburn Evening Star carried the following report in its issue of April 17th, 1962. A flying saucer, a curved, glowing star, was seen by Mr. Clarence Sneider, of King Street, Whalley, is still wondering just what it was. He and neighbors saw that over Whalley on Wednesday night.

Describing the object, Mr. Sneider said, "It was round, extremely bright and I kept seeing colors to red and then back to white. We were watching it closely. I just happened to look out of the window and there it was. I am unsure and not quite certain what I saw, but I cannot make out what it was. I went next door and my neighbors looked at it. They were mystified as I was. Altogether it was a very bright object and in about an hour I can only think that it was one of the many satellites that are in orbit."

Mr. Sneider added, "One of the first things I did was to ring Stonyhurst College to see whether the observatory there had seen it. But apparently was not holiday."
