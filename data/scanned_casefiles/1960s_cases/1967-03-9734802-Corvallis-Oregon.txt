The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record, which is a report from the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects. The text on the image provides details about an observation made on March 29, 1967 in Corvallis, Oregon. The observer saw an "astro(naut)" object that was on an azimuth of 164 degrees at an elevation of 30 degrees. The observer was putting a dog out when the object was observed. The description notes that the object did not disappear, but was still visible when the observer quit looking. The document concludes that the description is consistent with an astronomical observation, and that an object like this would have been the brightest object in the southern sky during that time.

4. NATURE OF OBJECTS: Astro(naut)
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Visual
7. COURSE: Stationary
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: The description is consistent with an astronomical observation. Such an object would have been the brightest object in the southern sky at this time of the year.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer was putting the dog out doors when he looked up and saw a bright object. The object remained stationary in color.

2. LOCATION: Corvallis, Oregon

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2-4 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: westward
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: Balloon(hot air) Very Proper

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Various observers around the area reported a bright round shaped object which moved slowly toward the west. According to the witnesses, the object was very thin and another witness said the object was more of a yellow color than a red. The object slowly rose from the ground or at an low altitude and traveled toward the west. One witness said that the object looked like it burnt up above the trees.
It appears that the witnesses could have seen a plastic bag with candles such as have been responsible for numerous unidentified sightings. According to the descriptions, the object appeared to move slowly and more like a balloon/hot air device rather than a powered aircraft of any kind.
