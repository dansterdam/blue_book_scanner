11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Various observers around the area reported a bright round shaped object red in color slowly travel toward the west. One witness said that it looked like the object was on fire. Another witness said the object was more of a yellow color than a red. The object slowly rose from the ground or at an low altitude and traveled toward the west. One witness said that the object looked like it burnt up above the horizon.

It appears that the witnesses could have seen a plastic bag with candles such as have been responsible for numerous UFO sightings of late. A recent article appeared describing the construction of such a device.
