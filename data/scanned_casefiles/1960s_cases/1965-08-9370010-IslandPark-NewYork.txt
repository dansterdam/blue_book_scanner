11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer noted lights that appeared for almost 2 hours above a neighbor's house. Lights were like a bright moon appearing one at a time. 4 lights were observed during the 2 hour period.
Photo analysis identified the UFOs as point sources of light. Camera movement probably caused each point of light to appear as a larger irregular image.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text on a document. The text appears to be a report or statement about a UFO sighting. There are several redacted or blacked out sections that obscure portions of the text.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

...a pretty big thing came moving in very steadly toward me at some 25 to 30 feet it may be of some interest to many to try to verify this as it would seem to indicate something quite unusual in the sky over here May strike me as a bit fantastic but it certainly gave me quite a start as it came slowly on and right past where I was standing something that does not strike me as any kind of normal aircraft even of the latest and most advanced type...

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a handwritten document or note. The document page is mostly blank, with a single vertical line drawn on the right side. Below the line, there is handwritten text that appears to be a description or commentary about something, though the exact content is unclear from the image alone.

Text from the document:

The line of demarcation is quite obvious and stands out in sharp contra5c to the background surface. The motion of the object was very rapid - so rapid that it could not be followed by the eye. The object was maneuverable and changed direction more than once during its flight. There was no engine noise or any other sound associated with the object.

TIPPET/CAPT J. Quinlanilla, Jr/TO916/h/11 AUG 65
UFO SIGHTINGS, 21 AUGUST 1965

1. REFERENCE the unidentified observation of 21 August 1965. Analysis has been completed on these negatives which were forwarded to the office of SD on 1 Aug 65. We are returning the original negatives.

2. The following is extracted from the photo analysis report:

The UFO in question cannot be identified beyond the fact that it is considered to be of light source. The shape, color and movement are characteristic of single-engine fighter-type aircraft or possible swamp gas phenomena. The blue-white lights on the object were probably caused by tungsten-type lights, while the slow movement and intermittent lighting is indicative of real aircraft rather than anything more unusual. The movement of the camera through a normal lens causing an irregular image is the suspected cause of the irregular lights. The object was observed for a maximum 30 seconds. Negatives indicated luminance between 24 and 30 exposures on each negative. Based on the details on the negatives, we have no reason to request any further examination.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a Photo Analysis Report from Project Blue Book regarding an "unidentified flying object" sighted in Island Park, New York on August 21, 1965.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 66-34
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: ISLAND PARK, NEW YORK
DATE: 21 AUGUST 1965
PHOTOGRAPHY: POOR
P NRS: FOUR negatives, 3 prints (3x5), 4 prints (8x10), UFO Questionnaire
1. PURPOSE: This report is a joint answer by the Photo Processing and Photo Analysis Divisions to work Order 66-34, from Major H. Quintanilla's (TDIM/UFO) who asked for an analysis of UFO photography.
2. ANALYSIS OF PHOTOGRAPHY: The photography provided for analysis was a series of four 35mm negatives and seven prints made from them. Three 3x5 inch prints and four 8x10 inch prints were submitted. These photographs reportedly recorded an unidentified flying object observed by witnesses in Island Park, New York on 21 August 1965. The object observed was considered to be the UFO in question.
3. PHOTO INTERPRETATION: The photographic materials submitted are of poor quality and reflect considerable underexposure. The movement of the camera through multiple-exposure techniques produced indistinct and blurred images. No fine detail can be discerned and the images are considered unsuitable for detailed analysis. The questionnaire submitted stated that the shutter speed was 1/30 upper left quadrant of the original print number 3 was noted to have been altered, possibly with a pen.
