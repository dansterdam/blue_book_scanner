DEAR MR.

Your completed questionnaire concerning an unidentified aerial object sighting has been forwarded to the Air Force for evaluation. Lack of specific data and corroborating information from additional witnesses prevents a definite evaluation of your sighting. In light of new evidence the Air Force would be happy to re-evaluate the case.

Statistical information on the Air Force's unidentified aerial phenomena program is forwarded for your information.

Sincerely,

Washington 25, D.C.

Gentlemen:

I am sending you this information about a report of an unidentified flying object. The sighting occurred in the vicinity of Springfield, Ohio on July 16, 1952.

I believe the details of this report may be of interest to you. I could not identify, from the details supplied, the exact nature of the object. The report states that it was metallic in appearance, made a whining sound and disappeared rapidly. It was observed for several minutes and seen by a number of people. 

I would appreciate any information you can provide that might help identify the nature of this object. I have tried to investigate this sighting thoroughly and when I first notified about it, I was under the impression that it might have been some sort of experimental aircraft. However, as it disappeared too rapidly to be an aircraft, I am unable to identify it.

Please let me know if you can provide any assistance or guidance in this matter. This is the only available information I have on this sighting. I hope that you will be able to shed some light on what it may have been. Thank you very much for your consideration.

Yours very truly,
[Redacted]

TEXT OUTPUT:
HATERIAL EXAMINED: CUST

DESCRIPTION: The object was approximately 40 feet in diameter, saucer-shaped, and of a metallic luster appearance. It seemed to be rotating on its axis at a rate of 3 or 4 revolutions per minute. The object was silver-white in color and emitted no sound. It appeared to hover at about 500 feet altitude over the Springfield area for about 5 minutes.

SIGHTINGS: At about 10:45 p.m. EDT, on 4-8-62, the object was sighted by a number of persons at various locations in the Springfield, Ohio area. The object was first observed hovering over a housing area near the interceptor base. It soon moved out over the east end of the city and gradually faded from view.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: Clear sky, stars visible, light wind, temp. about 50 degrees.

IDENTIFICATION: Insufficient data is available to establish any identification of the object. It does not appear to conform to any known aircraft, satellite, or other identified aerial object. The description indicates it may have been a rare type of unidentified aerial phenomenon. No definite conclusion can be reached without further substantiation of the facts through additional inquiry or investigation.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a handwritten document with text and sketches. The text appears to be an observation report or interview notes related to a UFO sighting.

The text in the document reads as follows:

This can be as large as a football field so "a" is the smallest one you could see. How long in the air could you see it? Not very long 20 or 30 seconds only to complete the latter motion.

It was round shape conditions at the time 
Slightly oval shaped at first 
Got smaller like it was going away
Seemed to stand still at times 
Didn't move very fast
No noise or light that I could detect
Didn't remember

When did you report to some official that you had seen this? Not until the next day when I got home from work.
