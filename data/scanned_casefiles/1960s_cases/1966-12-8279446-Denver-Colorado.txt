PROJECT 10673 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 7 Dec 66
2. LOCATION: Denver, Colorado
3. SOURCE: (civilian)
10. CONCLUSION: The object was observed by three witnesses. At the same degrees and at the same azimuth.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Witnesses watched a clear like object larger than perform erratic movements in the eastern part of the sky. The object sides shimmering and appeared to be a solid object. The entire sighting lasted about five to 10 seconds. The object could have been a satellite which did not appear to be a satellite.
The description is consistent with that of an astroobject which would have been fairly low on the horizon and would have been the brightest object in the sky.

The image contains a hand-drawn diagram with annotations. The diagram appears to depict the movement and trajectory of an unidentified object, possibly a UFO. It includes annotations such as "27 inches - object", "object - star", "object travel as much as 6 inches in cone", and arrows showing the path of the object.

At the arrival of the object, it moved slowly and silently toward the observer, and a part of the moon was not seen.

The handwritten text in the document has been transcribed as follows:

At its arrival the object moved slowly and silently toward the observer 27' Inches - OBJECT

Text from the document:

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

Reference your letter regarding your December 7 observation allegedly of a bright object in the Denver, Colorado area. A light or lights were observed in the sky. The description, size, brightness, movements, and other characteristics are similar to many other reports of that type which are frequently received. This type of phenomenon is visible in the heavens.

When stars are viewed low on the horizon the observer is looking through many more miles of the earth's atmosphere than when looked at overhead. This distortion by the atmosphere can cause various colors or the illusion of pulsation. This phenomenon is called "scintillation". The closer the object, the more they scintillate because we are looking through more atmosphere. Planets twinkle far less than stars.

From the information submitted, it does appear that the sighting you observed was an astronomical phenomenon and not an unidentified flying object. The Air Force received several reports during November and early December of this type of sighting, as expected.

Thank you for reporting your sighting to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
GEORGE G. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil-Military Branch
