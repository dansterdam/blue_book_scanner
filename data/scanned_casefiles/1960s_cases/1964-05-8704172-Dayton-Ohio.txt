MYSTERY RINGS IN EUCLID, OHIO
The remnants of two rings can be found on the back lawn of Mr. and Mrs. Albert C. Weber, a plumbing contractor.

Mr. Weber said that the most recent ring, which is easily distinguishable, appeared about three weeks ago. The older ring, still visible in part, appeared in late April or May. Both rings are approximately 15 feet in diameter. A browned-out swath in the most recent ring is 1-2 feet wide, and forms a good circle. The Webers told Mr. Nice and the Editor that no deposits of any kind were seen by them anywhere in the area of the rings.

The older ring, on the left edge of their lawn, is 52 feet from the house; the newest ring is only 39 feet away, on the right edge. Dirt and root samples will be tested. A Kent State University Professor said in the past, that these are the by-products of fungus growth. Pictures of the most recent ring were taken, as it is still visible.

WHAT MADE THE RINGS?
Mrs. Weber claims that just before the first ring appeared, she had undergone an eerie experience, and still isn't sure what she saw.

She had left her French poodles out at 3:00 A.M. As usual, the weather was mildly and foggy, but she saw something that made the hair on her arms and head stand on end. Out there, on the left side, was a light colored object whose shape reminded her of a toy spinning top. The lower part was invisible. On the right side, vertically, stood a sail-like projection. The "top" stood about 6 feet tall.

She quickly called her dogs into the house, shut the door, doused the lights, and looked out the window. She could see nothing, doesn't know why she didn't illuminate the area again.

She waited till 6:30 A.M. when her husband got up before she told him.

Soon after the first donut ring of burned-out grass appeared, 50 feet from the house. She noted that the dogs did not act up during this episode. Exact date unknown, but their guess was late April or early May.

Mr [redacted] called at 2250, 16 May 1964.
He stated that he had heard a report on
a local radio station about lights in the
sky. He seemed to think that the Air
Force would not take him seriously. He
began to answer my questions, when he
said someone was at the door and would
have to hang up, but would call back
in a few minutes. He failed to do this.
His son also stated that he saw something
in the sky.
