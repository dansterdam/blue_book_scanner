PROJECT IC073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME: 22 Oct 67 - 2230/23
2. LOCATION: Milledgeville, Georgia 
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NAMES OF OBJECTS: - 
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 to 10 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground visual
7. COURSE: See case
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Case: Probable HOAX
Notes: Insufficient data for evaluation.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: 
The observer left his home to go UFO hunting. He stated that he saw photographs that his neighbor had taken of the object. The observer stated that there were heat waves around the object that he could not explain.
Comments: The observer was the only one to see the object and previously stated that he was going UFO hunting. The first photo was taken while the observer was talking on the telephone to the University of Colorado when he saw the object. The second photo was taken about a minute later. It is felt that the photo is a small one that is difficult to interpret as being real because the Air Force has made several previous photographic studies that were also questionable.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

I have been working on a small rock quarry with my cousin for the past three years. While working in the quarry on the afternoon of October 7, 1967, at approximately 4:00 p.m., I observed a very unusual sight in the sky that I can best describe as a flying saucer-shaped object. The object was silvery in color and appeared to be rotating as it moved through the sky. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and seemed to be slightly higher than the height of the surrounding hills. The object was visible for approximately 30-45 seconds before it disappeared from view behind some trees. I was surprised and somewhat frightened by what I saw, as I had never observed anything like this before. I immediately told my cousin about what I had seen, and we both watched the skies for the next several minutes, but the object did not reappear. I am certain that what I observed was not an airplane or any other known aircraft. The object moved and behaved in a manner that was entirely inconsistent with conventional aircraft. I have no explanation for what I witnessed, but I am confident that it was an unidentified flying object of some kind.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The craft was circular, like a doughnut or cookie, and very large. The object appeared to be hovering over a wooded area and was still glowing, giving off a brilliant light. The object was disc-shaped, and appeared to have an open center. To the observer it looked like the lights around the outside were rotating. After a short time, the object suddenly accelerated and shot away, disappearing."

Output of OCR:

When you came down here, you told your mother that you were going hunting. And you had your camera with you.
My BB gun.
A camera and a BB gun. You were going to shoot the UFO with a BB gun. 
All right, you came down the highway. Your mother -
I just walked down the road.
You walked down the road from your house with your camera and your gun. And you went all alone. Did you see anyone else in this area when?
No, I didn't see anyone else when I came down here.
How far is this from your home, Dave?
I don't know.
How long does it take you to walk it generally?
About an hour.
About an hour.
I think about an hour.
Is this an area that you come out quite frequently when you get a chance to get out?
Sometimes I come out here when, well, you know, sometimes when I got nothing to do, I think about things. And you say I come out here quite frequently?
But it's sort of a favorite area to come and sort of hike around here, isn't it? By gosh, I just stopped in this thing. And I attack it more than this one. Are you sure that this is the bus stop down here?
I'm positive that it was that one.
You're positive that it was the little one? Why don't we go on.
Story, you first noticed this object when?

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed text document containing a transcript of a conversation or interview related to a UFO sighting.

When it climbed over the trees over there, I wasn't really looking over there I was, you know, I was just messing around. Kicking up these was objects you first saw me up here, you know. When you first saw the object?
On the road. All right, and where was the object? About right up there; just setting there.
How high was it when you first noticed it? I couldn't get high enough to look high it was because I'm not that good at heights and all that.
But it was off the ground and wasn't landed or anything? It wasn't on the ground.
And how far out did it look to you compared with the trees? It seemed to be above those little trees out there.
Right above them? Maybe a little in back of them, but above them. Maybe a little on the other side of them?
Yes, Sir. How long was it after you first saw the object before you decided to? I suppose maybe a half minute.
Well, I guess it was over there and during that time you did that, in order to arrive here. Well, I walk down that old road looked, and guess. I didn't actually walk exactly where I walked, I guess, 'cause looked like it wouldn't see me or anything.
Was it hovering, or just standing still there? Well, it looked to be hovering when I first saw it, but then I moved and it was moving a little bit.

Craig: Moving in that direction, Dave?
Well, up and down, maybe it was moving a little back out towards the right.
How big did it look to you?
Well, at first glance it looked to be maybe 50 feet long, or something like that. But it could have been real small, the distance was indistinct.
But it did look like a big object, about 50 feet across?
Yes, sir.
You crossed this fence before you took the picture?
Yes, Sir, because these trees were in the way.
Were the trees in the way when you crossed that opening, or the fence?
Well, I don't know why I didn't take the picture up there. I guess because it had moved up why, I lost it, you know.
You wanted to get on this side of the fence so that you would have a clear shot of the object to take the picture?
I guess the reason was, the reason.
Where did you cross the fence, David?
Up there at the gate.
I came across at the wooden gate. Did you run up here to this spot, you speak up, or what?
I sorta stumbled up.
You sorta stumbled up, O.K. Could you tell me some of your thoughts that were going through your mind when you saw this? You were UFO hunting, so think this was a UFO?
Well, after maybe a minute or so it sort of calmed down a little bit, and that's when I thought, "So that is a UFO." So I had my camera wrapped around my belly and I thought, "well, I'd better take off my camera" and I thought this, I pulled out the film and put it in my camera, and I was still going pretty slow, because I was real nervous, and I was pulling out the film and getting the camera and then I pulled out the film and set it down, and then I heard my friend coming and someone call out and I said to him, "Did you see that?" and he said, "No, I missed it." And then I heard my friend coming back some time later.

Text from the document:

He said that he grabbed up the pictures and ran up there like a - I was so scared that I was yelling like something was after me. He said that though these white lights to come out of something, I grabbed the pictures and when we got back down here, it was gone. It started dropping down, he said, and when it got to about 20 feet from the ground, it started calling - it started rising in the air. It started picking up.

Had it moved quite a distance between the two pictures you took? 
No, sir. It looked to be further away.

A little further away. Did you want to take more pictures or were you afraid to get any closer picture all of a sudden?
I was so scared that I guess two pictures was all I could take. I was so scared and dressed up it as I could describe how scared I was.

Why, were you scared?
Well, there it was hovering out there. I read Science fiction, and all stories of these weird actions, you know. There it is, out there in the field. - And I am all alone, and I was so scared, you know.

You are a member of a little club of your friends, a flying saucer club.
And how many people are there in your club? 
Four.

Four members. And you discuss this sort of thing quite a bit, I see.
Yes, sir.

Was this boy that came down with you a member of this flying saucer club?
No, I had never seen anything like that before, no flying saucer, I had up and watched the members. But he hasn't seen a flying saucer, either.

Craig
When you stayed up to watch meteors, was this in hopes of sighting a spaceship?

Just to watch meteors. My friend is--what do you call it--not a meteor watcher, but an astronomer. He has one of those little telescopes. He says we were going to have a meteor shower coming up in a few days. I think he called it the Lyrids, or the Perseids, or something like that. But that one that was sighted over here, they say it went way off.

Craig
Did you see that one?

No. We didn't know anything about it until this morning.

Craig
Knowing that you were going to developed pictures with this little Brownie camera, tell me about how you operated it and the timing of it.

Do you count 15 seconds off the last you can't. go into 15 thousand and two, one thousand and two.

Then you snapped one picture, and 15 seconds during development, and it looked pretty good. And waited another 15 seconds, and looked at it. It didn't look pretty good to me, because I just glanced at it and saw it was blurred or something. But this friend of mine, he claims he can tell, before my eyes heard him calling, because I was so damned interested in watching that light go down the road, I never noticed him behind me. I heard my friend coming down the road, I turned around and he says "Do you want to see your friend, And then I went to show it to him, and saw the place I had tried to get on the view of the object.

But I mean to tell you they did cut out the view of the object. I did go to look up there, and he didn't use it. 

No, I looked up there with him, and neither one of us saw it. A balloon wouldn't have been able to get out of the way that fast.

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The text appears to be a transcript or record of a conversation between two individuals, Craig and an unnamed person, discussing an unidentified flying object (UFO) or object that they observed.

Craig: You don't think that it was a weather balloon?
No, sir. 
Craig: What do you think it was?
I don't think that I am qualified to say what it was. But it sure looked strange to me.
Craig: Do you think that you could duplicate something like that, it you had the equipment?
No, I don't think so. Not unless I really had some special equipment and took a lot of time on it.
Craig: I thought about it last night. We kept looking at my pictures to see if we could make out some things that they call refuses. It looked like two fringes, you know, up and down, and I could make out some colors - it was almost a solid color, but it wasn't.
If you made something like that, do you think that you could throw it over and get it to stay?
Well, I don't think so, not if I threw it up like that. Well, it just goes.
Craig: You couldn't keep it right side up?
I don't think so.
Craig: Could you make something like that and suspend it from a tree and a picture of it, while it hangs from a fish line, or something like that?
Sure. I mean, if I had the things, you know, I could probably do that. But I don't know if there are any brand marks on it that you can see, you know, in the picture.
Craig: There's not really any brand marks on it, the position to hang it, well, you see, I don't know what really happened, but there's where you have to take it to be as big as what you got.
I would probably have to take it to here. How do you mean, "from here?" The frisbee over the branch, from where you saw it. If the frisbee was right here, I would have to take it to be about the size of the one.
Craig: All right. If you took it from where you did, and it was frisbee, what would you do?

that you could make, something like the object that you saw, tha

I think that it would have to be maybe a little over that dead tr
a little bit over the dead tree?
Craig: The one that is across the field?
This one right here (referring to photograph).
Craig: Yes, if you had someone with you, do you think that he could throw it up
to it. You couldn't hang it up from anything, right?
Craig: Yes, Sir.
If you had someone with you, do you think that he could throw it up and take
a picture and duplicate it that way?
Craig: Yes, up in the sky, it should get a blur, because this thing, I think,
exactly the same picture, doesn't get a blur?
Craig: Do you know what speed that lens is, how fast it takes a picture?
No, Sir. But I have tried to take pictures of moving objects be-
cause the photographs show little blurs.
It blurs? What do you tell all these people who say you faked bec
I just say wait until I get my pictures back, and I will show them
exactly what these things look like. Maybe they say I'm mente 
a liar, I tell them to believe what they want to.
Craig: As long as you know that you are not a liar, that's what is import
That's right.

Craig    You are being real honest about this situation?  This is exactly the way you see it?
Yes, Sir.
Craig    Do you have any ideas where this might have come from, or might have gone to?
No, Sir.  But they have been sighted around the lake out there.  I and my friends have been speculating that maybe they use the lake for cover or something, they hide under the water.
Craig    You think that it sort of lives locally?  It doesn't come from a distance?
No.  I think that it comes from a long way off.  But recently it is the same one that has been seen by everyone that lives around here.
Craig    What is the name of this lake out here, Dave?
Lake Sinclair.
Craig    Lake Sinclair.  And this is a lake that is about 20 miles long, is it?
Well, I really couldn't tell you.
Craig    Sort of a dam on a river?
There is a dam out here, I think.  It is a man-made lake, with only one part of it, and it is about 20 miles long.
Craig    Did you notice anything else about the object you saw?
It was shimmering like it had heat waves around it, or something.
Craig    Could you see any other detail on the object?  Were there any windows or lights like that?  You said that it was shimmering.
Well, it was shimmering like on a hot day, when there is a haze.  You look out a window and you see the light being diffused through the haze.  It was sort of like that.
Craig    Surrounding the whole object?

It was real faint. It was surrounding the whole object.
On the bottom, as well as above it?
On the bottom, as well as above it.
How did the color of the object appear to you?
Well, it looked metallic, like steel or something.
Silvery colored?
Was it spinning?
It wasn't spinning. And it was silver colored.
Could you describe the motion that you observed, in close detail, as it came near, as it went past you, and as it went away, coming down and going up?
Did it have any motion, other than the gradual shifting of position?
No, it didn't seem to have any other motion than the changing in position.
Is that the motion? Well, it didn't seem like that at all.
It was almost quite stationary, with slight movement. It was hovering like a well-ballasted balloon and stick. It looked like it landed in the trees. It will hover like a balloon, when it lands, if it should land.
What is this kind of motion? How about noise, did you hear anything?
None whatsoever?
No, sir.
Where is your think attracted your attention to it, Dave?
Well, I just looked up there, and there it was. I can't say that attracted my attention to it, except that it did reflect the sunlight.
Like a mirror. Was it bright to look at?
It wasn't that bright.

Craig
Did it hurt your eyes to look at it?
It didn't hurt my eyes at all. It just reflected the sunlight a little bit.
Craig 
What did you do with the negatives when you took the pictures before that?
Well, I had them in my other hand. I figured that they were unusual in some way.
Craig
But you did have the negatives in your hand? You did keep them with you?
Well-born
While you are standing there, let's see if we can get it in with a longer exposure. There may be a little more detail than we can see under the conditions that we have got.
Craig
This picture is much like the first one or the second one you took. Maybe like the second one, I think.
Well-born
Positively-like to the tree trunk.
Craig
You can see in that picture the dead tree in the middle very nearly in contact. You can see the limbs and things that come out from the trunk. Just above that branch of the dead tree, second from the left, is the dead one shown in the natural position. This dead tree (Mr. -----'s) is in the picture, and he was standing 25 paces from where the photographer was located.
Well-born
Five fee beyond the tree.
Craig
Again, F-22, f-20 were 25 pases from the photographer. O.K. I guess that those pictures are quite unusual.

Dear Major:

I am listing the information on sightings by this department:

19th October 1967 3 AM Patrol Car Crew (4 men) observed an object at an altitude of about 1500 ft. that changed color from bright white to dark blue or black and then back to bright white. After about 10 minutes it sped away.

22nd October 1967 5:30 AM Tourist passing through Milledgeville stopped at this department and reported seeing an object hovering over the water of Lake Sinclair. He stated it looked like a "ball of fire" and no sound was heard, and the patrol car at about 300 yds would speed up with the object as it started to move away. The object then took off straight up and disappeared.

23rd October 1967 Between 4 and 6 AM. Object reported by 2 Milledgeville residents, one a college student, observed an object that changed colors from bright white to orange to red. It would not get close to the ground and could not keep up with the speed of the object.

22 OCT 1967 3:30 PM W/R 13 photos near the Georgia Military College were brought to headquarters concerning the sighting. Officers in patrol cars, and at the station observed the object in daytime.

REPORT NO. 7286098
INCIDENT DATE: OCTOBER 7, 1967
LOCATION: MILLEDGEVILLE, GEORGIA

SUBJECT'S NARRATIVE:
At approximately 2230 hours on 7 October 1967, Mr. John Doe, a resident of Milledgeville, Georgia, observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over his home. Mr. Doe stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape, glowing with a bluish-white light, and moved silently across the sky at a high rate of speed before suddenly disappearing.

Mr. Doe immediately contacted local authorities to report the sighting. An investigation was launched, but no physical evidence or corroborating witnesses were found to substantiate Mr. Doe's claim.

INVESTIGATOR'S ANALYSIS:
Based on the available information, the object observed by Mr. Doe is classified as "Unidentified." No conclusive explanation for the sighting could be determined, and the case remains open for further investigation.

- page 33 -

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from the Project Blue Book archives.

Photographs taken by investigators and Dr. Roy Craig - original photographs were lost by investigators who made copies of them.

It should be noted that on the mornings of my department and myself sighted objects we were unable to identify as police department have made sightings as well and find that were also making sightings.

We do not want anyone to make any statements that would give the impression that anything is intentionally withheld from the public or ridicule. We know that we have seen "unidentified" whatever also do not have any desire for publicity, or make any statements that might tend to stimulate this.

I am sure that Dr. Roy Craig or Robins Air Force Base will gladly advise you of their findings, we have not been shown them since they left here. I am sure you will understand our position.

Yours truly,
Eugene A. Ellis, Chief
City Police

20 NOV. 1967
Called Dr. Craig at the Univ of Colorado.
They have not sized the object yet but they will send us the report as soon as they do. The size in the USO picture is a quite small one and was only very tiny invebible but could not be as large as a frisbee. The other boy was in the area because he was brought in a car to near the spot and then left. The contect used is an ordinary wooden college.
