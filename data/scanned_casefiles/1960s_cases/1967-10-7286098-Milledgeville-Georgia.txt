11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer left his home to go UFO hunting. He started that he saw and photographed a metallic saucer shaped object. The observer stated that there were heat waves around the object and that it was roughly in the south.

Comments: The observer was the only one to see the object. He had previously stated that he was going UFO hunting. During a conversation to the University of Colorado it was learned that the boy was sitting on the ground when both photos were taken. The first photo was taken while sitting in a bush. The boy then moved to his right and took a second photo. The boy could give no reason for sitting down to photograph the object. It is felt that the photo is a small object suspended from a tree that appears in both the photos. No photo analysis has been performed because the Air Force has never received the original polaroid photos.

[Handwritten text, partially legible:]

I was out taking some shots with in the area... interested in watching along about 2100... thought I would take my camera and go out to find a U.F.O. just my coming and went down where the U.F.O. was. Pulled to came out of the woods, which was very crossing the fence, was it don't remember a number standing after it was watching its lot a few minutes. Then I remembered that left my camera so I took it, and look at it. But then the same started moving about my name, I stopped and took some color of them. I felt like pictures and gave it shaped the picture at time of seeing it back to where I am now.

When we arrived the U.&.O. was left here west. We stayed there for about five minutes and then started home.

I was we got home at dark but the phone and called the place. I was still shaking from fright when we got to the station and we they took us back to where I had seen the U.&.O. We didn't find anything.

I left my picture at the station.

Craig: When you came down here, you told your mother that you were going UFO hunting. And you had your camera with you, did you have anything else with you?

[Redacted]: My BB gun.

Craig: A camera and a BB gun. You were going to shoot the UFO with a BB gun?

[Redacted]: No, I just brought that along.

Craig: All right, you came down the highway. Your mother -

[Redacted]: I just walked down the road.

Craig: You walked down the road from your house with your camera and your BB gun and you were all alone. Did you see anyone else in this area when you came down here?

[Redacted]: No, I didn't see anyone else when I came down here.

Craig: How far is this from your home, Dave?

[Redacted]: I don't know.

Craig: How long does it take you to walk it generally?

[Redacted]: About an hour.

Craig: About an hour.

[Redacted]: I think about an hour.

Craig: Is this an area that you come out quite frequently when you get a chance?

[Redacted]: Sometimes I come out here when, well, you know, sometimes when you have lots to do and you want to think about things. I come out here, but not too often, you know.

Craig: But it is sort of a favorite area to come and sort of hike around in, and knock around? By the way, I just stepped in this thing, and it really sticks you more than this one. Are you sure that this is the bush that you sat down in, or was it that one right there?

[Redacted]: I'm positive that it was that one.

Craig: You're positive that it was the little one? Why don't we go on. In your story, you first noticed this object when?

Page number: 2


- page 13 -

When it climbed over the trees over there. I wasn't really looking out over there I was, you know, I was just missing around. Kicking rocks.

Craig: Where was the object when you first saw it? You were up here, were you up here yet when you first saw the object?

I was right up there. See where the trees start clearing?

Craig: On the - on the road. All right, and where was the object?

About right up there; just sitting there.

Craig: How high was it when you first noticed it?

I couldn't tell you how high it was because I'm not that good at telling heights and all that.

Craig: But it was off the ground and wasn't landed or anything?

It wasn't on the ground.

Craig: And how far out did it look to you compared with the trees?

It seemed to be above those little trees out there.

Craig: Right above them?

Maybe a little in back of them, but above them.

Craig: Maybe a little the other side of them?

Yes, Sir.

Craig: How long was it after you first saw the object before you decided to take a picture of it?

I suppose maybe a half minute.

Craig: O.K. You were over here and during that time you did what, in order to arrive here?

Well, I didn't run; I walked, I guess. I didn't exactly walk either - I walked real slow over here so that it wouldn't see me, or something like that. It was a shock seeing it.

Craig: Was it hovering, or just standing still there?

Well, it looked to be hovering when I first saw it, but then I noticed that it was moving a little bit.

3


- page 14 -

Here is the text from the document:

Craig: Moving in what direction, Dave?

Well, up and down, maybe it was moving a little back out towards the river.
I couldn't tell.

Craig: How big did it look to you?

Well, at first glance it looked to be maybe 50-feet long, or something like
that. But I couldn't tell the exact dimensions.

Craig: But it did look like a big object, about 50 feet across?

Yes, Sir.

Craig: You crossed this fence before you took the picture?

Yes, Sir, because these trees were in the way.

Craig: Were the trees in the way when you crossed that opening, or the fence in the
way, or what?

Well, I don't know why I didn't take the picture up there. I guess I
could have. All the way down here, I kept my eyes on it, you know, so that
I could get inside here.

Craig: You wanted to get on this side of the fence so that you would have a better
view of the object to take the picture?

I guess that is the reason.

Craig: Where did you cross the fence, David?

Up there at the gate.

Craig: You crossed at the wooden gate. Did you run up here to this spot, or did
you sneak up, or what?

I sort of stumbled up.

Craig: You sort of stumbled up. O.K. Could you tell me some of your thoughts
at the time? What did you think it was? You were UFO hunting, so did you
think this was a UFO?

Well, after maybe a minute I sort of calmed down a little bit, and I thought
that it was a UFO. So I had my camera wrapped around my belt right here,
so I unbuckled my belt and took off my camera. I thought that I had better
take some pictures of it, or else nobody is going to believe me. So I took
two pictures of it, and I was still going pretty slow, because I was still
scared. The pictures that I took - I pulled out the first one and looked at
it, and set it down. Then I pulled out the second one and looked at it,
and set it down. And then I heard my friend coming - someone calling for

4


- page 15 -

me - so I grabbed up the pictures and ran up there like a - I was so
scared that I was yelling like something was after me. He said that
though that a snake had got me or something. I showed him the pictures,
and he looked at them for 5 or 10 seconds, and I kept pulling him toward
the road, and when we got back down here, it was gone. It started to
leave, don't know exactly if it started to leave, but it started going
higher up in the air when he started calling - about a little before he
started calling - it started rising up in the air. It started picking up
speed, it looked like.

Craig     Had it moved quite a distance between the two pictures you took? Did it
          seem to be about the same place when you took the second picture?

          No, Sir. It looked to be farther away.

Craig     A little farther away. Did you want to take more pictures, or were you
          interrupted by your friend calling, or was two pictures all you wanted of
          it, or what?

          I was so scared that I guess two pictures was all I could take. I was
          surprised that I was even able to take two, because I was so scared. I
          can't describe how scared I was.

Craig     Why were you scared?

          Well, there it was hovering out there. I read Science Fiction, and I read
          all sorts of weird science fictions, you know. There it is, getting out
          there in the field. And I am all alone, and I was so scared, you know. I
          can't tell you how scared.

Craig     You are a member of a little club of your friends, a flying saucer club?

          Yes, Sir.

Craig     And how many people are there in your club?

          Four.

Craig     Four club members. And you discuss this sort of thing quite a bit?

          Yes, Sir.

Craig     Was this boy that came down with you a member of this flying saucer club?

          Yes, Sir.

Craig     Had any of you ever seen a flying saucer before?

          No, I had never seen anything like that before, no flying saucer. We've
          stayed up and watched the meteors. But we hadn't ever seen a flying saucer.

5


- page 16 -

Here is the text from the document:

Craig    When you stayed up to watch meteoras, was this in hopes of seeing a flying
         saucer? Or was it just to watch meteors?

Just to watch meteors. My friend is - what do you call it - not a professional -
an amateur astronomer. He gets books on astrology, and he has a telescope.
He told us that we were going to have a meteor shower from up in the
sky. I couldn't tell you the exact position. Orion, Orion that is it. So
we stayed out there, and we watched, and we saw 42. We didn't see any flying
saucer. But those that we saw started over here, they saw it at 1 o'clock,
and we got up about 2:30 and went outside, outside the camp. We stayed in
the camp until 2:30.

Craig    Did you see that one?

No. We didn't know anything about it until the morning.

Craig    I see. This one here that you saw and took the pictures of, how long does
         it take you to develop pictures with this little Stinger camera that you
         have?

         Fifteen seconds.

Craig    Do you count 15 seconds off the best you can?

I go "one thousand and one, one thousand and two, one thousand and three...".

Craig    Then you snapped one picture, and 15 seconds during development, and you tore
         it off to see if you had a picture, and it looked pretty good. You snapped
         another picture, and waited another 15 seconds, and looked at it, before you
         heard your friend calling you?

It didn't look pretty good to me, because I just glanced at it and put it
down, and snapped the second one, you know. He was calling me, I think,
before I sat down the first one, because I seem to remember hearing
something before my ears heard him calling, because I was so dazed. I
didn't exactly study the picture. I glanced at it and sat it down. Then
I took the second one. And as I was - turned that one down, As I was
coming that one down, I heard my friend coming down the road.

Craig    You didn't see the object leave. It was going up on the way a little bit,
         gradually as the way you went to meet your friend. And the trees between
         here and there you met your friend out out the view of the object. Is that
         it?

No, I mean up there they did cut out the view of the object. I came back
here and told him to look up there, and he didn't see it.

Craig    Did you see it again?

No, I looked up there with him, and neither one of us saw it. A weather
balloon wouldn't have been able to get out of the way that fast.

- page 17 -

Craig: You don't think that it was a weather balloon?
[Redacted]: No, Sir.

Craig: What do you think it was?
[Redacted]: I don't think that I am qualified to say what it was. But it sure looked weird.

Craig: Do you think that you could duplicate something like that, if you tried to, by just throwing up some kind of object and taking a picture? Do you think you would be able to duplicate a picture like that?
[Redacted]: I thought about it last night. We kept looking at my pictures to see what it resembled. It looked like these saucer things that these kids buy at the stores that they call frisbees. I looked like two frisbees glued together with a cup on top. I guess I could make one of those, if I had two frisbees and a cup.

Craig: If you made something like that, do you think that you would throw it up and get a picture pretty much like the one you got?
[Redacted]: Well, I don't think so, not if I threw it up like that. Well, it would flop over.

Craig: You couldn't keep it right side up?
[Redacted]: I don't think so.

Craig: Could you take something like that and suspend it from a tree and take a picture of it, while it hangs from a flat line, or something like that?
[Redacted]: Well, frisbees are heavy, and I don't know if there are any branches on that tree - well, maybe.

Craig: There are not really any trees in the right position to hang that from in your pictures, are there? If we stood here where you took your picture, you'd see that there are no part of it. If it was a frisbee, how far out would you have to take it to be as big as what you got?
[Redacted]: I would probably have to take it to here.

Craig: How do you mean, "from here"? The frisbee over the branch, from the lower back here to get it to be about the size of the - - -

Craig: All right. If you took it from where you did, and it was frisbee size, how

7


- page 18 -

far away would the frisbee be about over the branches of the little dead tree, or farther out than that?

What do you mean?

Craig: If you should make one of these little models like you are suggesting that you could make, somewhat like the object that say, an object would be much closer than what you took a picture of, looking that distance away? How far any would you think that you would have to have the frisbee if you were trying to duplicate that picture? Say you stood in the same place that you are now, would the frisbee be beyond that little dead tree?

I think that it would have to be maybe a little over that dead tree.

Craig: A little bit over the dead tree?

Yes.

Craig: The one that is across the field?

This one right here (referring to photograph).

Craig: But there is no tree there. So you would have to throw it up to duplicate it. You couldn't hang it up from anything, right?

Yes, Sir.

Craig: If you had someone with you, do you think that he could throw it and you take a picture and duplicate it that way?

Well, if he threw it up, it would cause a blur, because this thing is not exactly that accurate.

Craig: Do you know what speed that lens is, how fast it takes a picture?

No, Sir. But I have tried to take pictures of moving objects before - like cars and things like that, but it blurs.

Craig: It blurs? What do you tell all these people who say you faked this picture?

I just say, "Wait until I get my pictures back, and I will show you. It's not a fake." I will then to believe what they want to, mostly. When people call me names, I tell them to believe what they want to. If they call me a liar, I tell them to believe what they want to.

Craig: As long as you know that you are not a liar, that's what is important to you?

That's right.

- page 19 -

Craig: You are being real honest about this situation? This is exactly the way you saw it?

[Redacted]: Yes, Sir.

Craig: Do you have any ideas where this might have come from, or might have gone to?

[Redacted]: No, Sir. But they have been sighted around the lake out there. I think that it is out in that direction. I and my friends have been speculating that maybe they use the lake for cover or something, they hide underneath the water.

Craig: You think that it sort of lives locally? It doesn't come from a great distance?

[Redacted]: No, I think that it comes from a long way off. But recently it has been out there at the lake, cause almost everyone that has seen it has seen it out around the lake out there.

Craig: What is the name of this lake out here, Dave?

[Redacted]: Lake Sinclair.

Craig: Lake Sinclair. And this is a lake that is about 20 miles long, is it?

[Redacted]: Well, I really couldn't tell you.

Craig: Sort of a dam on a river?

[Redacted]: There is a dam out there, I know that much. I couldn't tell you how long it is. I am only familiar with only one part of it, and it is about 3 miles long.

Craig: Did you notice anything else about the object you saw?

[Redacted]: It was shimmering like it had heat waves around it, or something. But it didn't show up on the picture.

Craig: Could you see any other detail on the object? Were there any windows in it, or part size, or anything like that? You said that it was shimmering, like metal.

[Redacted]: Well, it was shimmering like on a hot day, when heat rises on a heater and you look out a window, when there is a heater near the window and you can see the light being diffused through the heat. It was sort of like a ring around it like that.

Craig: Surrounding the whole object?

[Redacted]: [No response visible]

Page number: 9


- page 20 -

It was real faint. It was surrounding the whole object.

Craig: On the bottom, as well as above it?

Craig: On the bottom, as well as above it.

Craig: How did the color of the object appear to you?

Well, it looked metallic, like steel or something.

Craig: Silvery colored?

Was it spinning?

It wasn't spinning, and it was silver colored.

Craig: Could you describe the motion that you observed, in close detail, again?

Well, it seemed to be above those trees, and it sort of comes down a little bit and goes back, went back a little bit, coming down and going back - maybe off to the side a little bit.

Craig: Did it have any motion, other than the gradual shifting of positions?

No, sir - you know, that you usually hear about flying saucers going real fast. Well, it didn't seem like that at all.

Craig: It was almost quite hovering, with slight movement?

We didn't have much wind that day. It was hovering like - well, if you take a helium balloon and stick it inside the house, it will hover. You know, so up.

Craig: That is this kind of motion. How about noise, did you hear anything?

There wasn't any noise to it.

Craig: None whatsoever?

No, Sir.

Craig: What do you think attracted your attention to it, Dave?

Well, I just looked up there, and there it was. I can't say that anything attracted my attention to it, except that it did reflect the sunlight.

Craig: Like a mirror. Was it bright to look at?

It wasn't that bright.

Craig: Did it hurt your eyes to look at it?

[Redacted]: It didn't hurt my eyes at all. It just reflected the sunlight a little bit.

Craig: What did you do with the negatives when you took the pictures before, Dave?

[Redacted]: Well, I had them in my other hand. I figured that they were useless. I almost crumpled them up.

Craig: But you did have the negatives in your hand? You did keep them with the positive?

Wellborn: While you are standing there, let's see if we can get it in with the camera's swing around a little bit, so that we can get a little more space on this side of this one over here (framing and taking picture with Dave's camera).

Craig: This picture is much like the first one or the second one you took. It doesn't look quite like either of them. Right?

[Redacted]: Maybe like the second one, I think.

Wellborn: Position-wise to the tree trunk.

Craig: You can see in that picture the dead trees in the middle very nicely. Can you pick out the tree in the clearing that you said that object was over? So the object was over the trees in the middle of the clearing? It was over that branch of the dead tree? Second from the left, sticking up high, is the dead one in that picture. Let's see if we can locate it in the original. This second picture taken on this roll was taken at 5 after 5 p.m. John (Vir. Airway) is in the picture, and he was standing 25 paces from the cameraman. It was photographed 5½ feet behind the tree. The area looks 6 feet beyond the tree.

Wellborn: Five fee beyond the tree.

Craig: Again, John, you were 25 paces from the photographer. O.K. I guess that thing is going to operate again. Picture No. 4 is taken in the same position as the original Polaroid, taken at 5:22 p.m.

Dear Major:

I am listing the information on sightings by my department:

19th October 1967 3 AM 2 Patrol Car Crews (4 Men) sighted object, looked like a large ball of red fire traveling up-down-zig-zag

22nd October 1967 5:30 AM Tourist passing through called ahead to this department and advised that there was an object at low altitude following him, large ball of red. Patrol cars (2) answered call and the object came up behind patrol car at about 300 Ft altitude, it would speed up with the cars, the cars stop the object stopped. Described about the size as an average city water tank. Then it shot straight up and went off south.

23rd October 1967 Between 4 and 6 AM. Object reported to this Headquarters. We called a plane that was manned by 2 Deputy Sheriffs and they spotted object but could not get close to it. They radioed Robins Air Force Base. This was also seen by 4 police officers in patrol cars, and a State Trooper.

22 Oct. 1967 3:30 PM. [partially illegible text] W/13 photographed an object near the Oconee River bottom. This polaroid shot was brought to headquarters by Villali.

23rd October 1967 Robins Air Force Investigators were at this Headquarters conducting an investigation

24th October 1967. Robins Air Force Investigators with Dr Roy Craig and John Ahrens from Boulder Colorado conducted an investigation.

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely degraded and illegible. While there is a document or photograph present, the text and details are so faded and obscured that I cannot confidently read or transcribe any text from it. The page looks like a black and white document with significant image quality issues that prevent clear optical character recognition.


- page 26 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a blank or nearly blank document page with some faint markings or watermarks, but no clear, readable text is visible.


- page 27 -

The image appears to be a very low-quality, grayscale scanned document with significant noise and degradation. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor scan quality. Only faint vertical and horizontal lines and some scattered dots are visible across the page. No clear text can be discerned from this image.


- page 28 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

"3 yards to top west at 170° bearing
390 yards to tree two midway, 170° bearing
340 yards to last tree 170° bearing
70 yards halfway (North side)"

In the top right corner, there are some partially legible notes that appear to read:
"26 Oct 67
Milledgeville, Ga"


- page 29 -

I apologize, but I cannot discern any legible text on this document. The image appears to be a very grainy, low-quality black and white photograph or document scan with significant noise and degradation. There are some blurry edges and textures visible, but no clear text is readable.


- page 30 -

I apologize, but the image appears to be a very low quality, grainy black and white photograph with significant degradation and blurriness. While there seems to be some kind of image or scene captured, the text and details are largely illegible. I cannot confidently extract any readable text from this document.


- page 31 -

I apologize, but the image appears to be a very low quality, grainy black and white photograph with significant degradation and blurriness. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor scan quality. I can see some faint outlines and textures, possibly suggesting a landscape or scene with some trees or structures on the right side, but I cannot confidently read any text on this page.


- page 32 -

The image appears to be a very low quality, grainy black and white photograph with significant degradation and noise. There is a faint diagonal line across the top of the image, and the right side of the image shows some vertical lines and edge details. However, the image is so degraded that no clear details or text can be discerned. The document appears to be a scanned page from an old report, but the content is essentially illegible.

Page 2.                                                      TDPT (UFO)

Photographs taken by [redacted] were shown to the Air Force Investigators and Dr. Roy Craig. Original photographs were loaned to these investigators who made copies of them.

It should be noted that on the mornings that members of my department and myself sighted objects we were in contact with other police departments at Thomson, Dublin and Pine Mountain area were also making sightings.

Members of my department have made sightings as recent as two weeks ago but when we made public our findings we were accused of being drunk-crazy and otherwise so we do not mention our sightings to anyone to do none. We did however make certain that at least two more officers from my department, Sheriffs Dept or Georgia State Patrol also see the "Something"

We know that we have seen "IT" whatever it may be, we also do not have any desire for publicity, or ridicule therefore we do not make any more statements of what we see.

I am sure that Dr. Roy Craig or Robins Air Force Base will gladly advise you of their findings, we have not heard anything from them since they left here. No statements, however, that is OK with us. I am sure you will understand our position.

Yours truly,
Eugene A. Ellis, Chief
City Police

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

20 Nov. 1967

Called Dr. Craig at the Univ of Colorado.

They have not sized the object yet but they will send us the copy. Photo when they are done with it.

The tree in the UWO picture is a quite small one and has only very tiny branches. Dr. Craig does not think they could support an object as large as a frisbee.

The other boy was in the area because Mrs. [redacted] brought him in the car to near the spot and then left. The camera used is an ordinary Kodak finder.


- page 43 -

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

Talked to the Univ of Colo. about the sightings. The boy was sitting on the ground when both photos were made.

The first photo was taken while sitting in a small bush.

The boy then moved to his right and took the second shot.

The boy could give no reason for sitting down to photograph the object.
