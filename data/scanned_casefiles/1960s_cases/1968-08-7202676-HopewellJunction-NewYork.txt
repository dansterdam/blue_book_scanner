SAF-OICC/Miss Turnure/76526/Dec. 17, 1968

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This replies to your letter of December 11, 1968, in which you state that you have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Unfortunately, we have found that after 30 days, precise details tend to become too vague in the observer's mind to permit a useful scientific investigation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation. This would yield more accurate analyses.

On the other hand, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the enclosed, often popular, UFO in the material that we are enclosing. In addition, you might wish to order for 20¢ a leaflet entitled Aids to Identification of Flying Objects, from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C. 20402.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF

Gentlemen:

What I am about to relate to you may to some people sound like an attempt for attention, but believe me, to me it was as real as the paper this letter is typed on. Please refer to the map I have attached.

It was on a night, not too late, in either late July or early August when I made a sighting. It wasn't too dark where shapes couldn't be seen against the sky. I was standing at one of the highest points in Camp Kinder - Ring, in Hopewell Junc., Poughkeepsie, when while I was looking through a group of trees that formed a " V", I saw what looked to me like a "saucer". I heard no noise though I did see two or three lights on the area above the bottom ridge. The color I felt was unimportant to the situation. After about one hour or less of hovering in one position it just seemed to vanish from sight. It didn't really zoom off into the horizon, it just seemed to melt into the sky. Everyone I told scoffed at me so I kept silent, until now when I decided to lecture my High School Class on the subject, as I have been following it for a number of years. I have no photographs or evidence, except my word, to prove what I am telling you. In going over the facts to myself, I ruled out swamp gas as it isn't a swampy area.

Please examine what I have told you, and do whatever you feel necessary.

Please get in touch with me soon.

Thank you very much,
[signature redacted]

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR 7 MINUTES 30 □AM □PM

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR 8 MINUTES 15 □AM □PM

4. TIME ZONE: □EASTERN □CENTRAL □MOUNTAIN □PACIFIC □STANDARD □OTHER

5. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? IF IN CITY GIVE THE NEAREST STREET ADDRESS AND INDICATE ON A MAP WHERE YOU WERE STANDING WITH REFERENCE TO THE AREA. IF IN THE COUNTRY, IDENTIFY THE LOCATION WITH REFERENCE TO SOME RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK:

NEAR POUGHKEEPSIE, HOPEWELL JUNCTION, NEAR THE TACONIC PKWY.

[The document also includes a diagram showing an observer's view of an object's position relative to the horizon, with angles marked from 0 to 90 degrees.]

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGING YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" OR THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIGZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
