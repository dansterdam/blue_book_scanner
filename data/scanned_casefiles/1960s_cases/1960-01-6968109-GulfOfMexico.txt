One

9. COURSE
6 to W

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A-52 Radar picked up object with estimated speed of 10-11,000 mph on collision course at 36,000 ft with heading of 060 deg. Air speed at time was 440 kts. Object bearing 20 deg on inbound track and 210 deg after passing a/c. Initial pickup on one radar at 60 nm. After passing a/c followed by second radar with 2 sec sweep and followed for 5 seconds with pickup at 1,560 yds, 5,000 yds and 9,000 yds. No meteorological investigation. No other a/c in area not picked up by ground Radar.

11. COMMENTS
Consultation with Lt. Bryant of ATIC-1 and his belief on that the object was interference from within the a/c due to the collision course and the fact that the object was not picked up by ground Radar. Considered to be caused by anomalous propagation.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other: Anomalous Prop.

APPROXIMATELY 1500 YARDS, 5000 YARDS, AND 9000 YARDS. THE ONLY KNOWN GROUND RADAR OPERATING IN THE VICINITY WAS "TAPE WORM" GCI. TAPE WORM WAS INFORMED OF THE SIGHTING BUT STATED THEY SAW NOTHING. WE UNDERSTAND THEIR SWEEP RATE IS 12 SECONDS, THEREFORE THE OBJECT WOULD NOT LIKELY HAVE APPEARED ON IT.

THE ONLY AVAILABLE METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL REPORT.

Major Robert J. Friend

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major Friend:

With reference to the anomalous radar sighting of which I took a transcript, I have checked with some of our radio astronomers and find that this might be a scattering phenomenon. In order to check this it is necessary to find out (as soon as possible, I hope) whether either of the radars had any range readings. Also, it is important to know whether there were any large surveillance or acquisition radars on the ground in the neighborhood. It is possible that there was a meteorological condition at the tropopause which was scattering the beam from a powerful ground radar. In this case, the radars on the plane would have observed a blip, but they would not have been able to get a series of range readings on it.

Thus this information is rather crucial.

I will await further information from you on this before I take the matter up with ARDC.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
Associate Director
