APPROXIMATELY 1500 YARDS, 5000 YARDS, AND 8000 YARDS. THE ONLY KNOWN GROUND RADAR OPERATING IN THE VICINITY WAS "TAIC" FORM ACI. TAPE WORM WAS INFORMED OF THE SIGHTING BUT STATED THEY SAW NOTHING. WE UNDERSTAND THEIR SWEEP RATE IS 12 SECONDS, THEREFORE THE OBJECT COULD NOT LIKELY HAVE APPEARED ON IT. 
THE ONLY AVAILABLE METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL REPORT.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from the Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory, written by J. Allen Hynek, the Associate Director, to Major Robert J. Friend of the ATIC at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. The document discusses an anomalous radar sighting and requests further information on the matter before taking any action.

Dear Major Friend:
With reference to the anomalous radar sighting of which I took a transcript, I have checked with some of our astronomers and find that this sighting is a statistical phenomenon. In order to clarify this matter, I would like to know whether the radars had any range readings. Also, it is important to know whether these large surveillance or acquisition radars on the ground in the neighborhood. It is possible that there was a meteorological condition at the troposphere which was scattering from a powerful ground radar. In this case, the radars on the plane would have observed a blip, but they would not have been able to get a series of range readings on it. Thus this information is rather crucial.
I will await further information from you on this before I take up the matter with ATIC.
Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
Associate Director
