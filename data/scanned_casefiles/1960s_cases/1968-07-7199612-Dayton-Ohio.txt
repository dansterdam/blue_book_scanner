11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer reported to the Duty Officer that on 8 July 1963 he sighted for approximately three minutes a bright, moving, star-like object.

A AF Form 117 was sent to the observer, the date of the observation as given on the form was listed as 8 Aug 68. Again it was of a moving star-like obj. The sighting (or sightings) appears to be of a satellite, however, because of the peculiar data and time of the sighting the case is being carried as CONFLICTING DATA.

INSUFFICIENT DATA

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted an oval shaped object that had a blurred ring of red lights then green lights. The object was flat on top and seemed to be spinning.

COMMENTS: The observer was requested to complete a list but the basis as given on the day officer was incorrect. The description is very similar to that of the serial advertise who was operating in the Dayton area. However, without a statement by the observer, the sighting is being carried as Insufficient Data.
