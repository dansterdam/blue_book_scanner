Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

CASE No. 10481 - 
LOCATION: Dayton, Ohio
DATE-TIME GROUP: 7 July 1968 - 2235 PM

The witness observed a light that appeared to be a very bright star in the southwest. The light was hovering and seemed to be stationary. After about 5 minutes, the light moved slowly to the east and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. The witness described the object as round and about 4-5 times the size of a star. No sound was heard. The witness estimated the object was at an elevation of 20-30 degrees above the horizon.

This image contains two photographs. The larger photograph in the center shows a person standing in a landscape with a horizon line and clouds in the sky. The smaller photograph in the bottom right corner shows a rocky outcrop or cliff face.

The text in the image appears to be part of a report or document, likely related to UFOs or aerospace research. The text discusses a "schematic sketch" and describes it as an "example" of how to complete a particular system.

Text found in the document:
