PAGE 4 RUN/#3774 UNCLAS
DIVISION: THE OBSERVER, MSGT THOMAS J. ARMS COMMENTED
TO THIS OFFICER THAT HE HAD ALSO OBSERVED WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE
THE SAME OBJECT AS THAT SEEN BY MR. ROLAND HOKLUND. SGT ARMS ALSO
STATED THAT HE CALLED THE SPACE DETECTION AND TRACKING CENTER AND
WAS TOLD THAT ECHO I WAS THEN PASSING THROUGH THIS AREA OF OREGON.
HE OBSERVED THE SATELLITE MOVEMENT ETC AND COULD DISTINGUISH THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ECHO I AND THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT. IN THE
OPINION OF SGT ARMS, THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS PROBABLY A STAR WHOSE
APPARENT MOVEMENT WAS CAUSED BY TEMPERATURE INVERSION. INASMUCH
AS THE OBJECT WAS NOT DETECTED ON RADAR AND BECAUSE SGT ARMS ALSO
STATED THAT IT EXHIBITED THE SAME INTENSITY AS THE NORTH STAR, I
CONCUR WITH HIS ANALYSIS, ARTHUR F. SHIFLETT, MAJOR, USAF, STAFF
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.
