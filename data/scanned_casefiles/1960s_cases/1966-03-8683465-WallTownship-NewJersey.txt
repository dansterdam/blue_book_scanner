QUALITY Eight negatives, five 3-1/2" x 4-1/2" prints, and eight 8" x 10" prints

1. PURPOSE: This report is written for Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., USAF, in Answer to Work Order 66-66. Additional analysis is performed as to what the unidentified object may be. Results of previous analysis were reported in Photo Analysis Report 66-25.
2. ANALYSIS: Photo Analysis Report 66-25 stated that information necessary for a more detailed analysis would include focal length of the camera and lens data. Due to having only the prints, no focal length or other lens calibration data is available as the original negatives were not available.
3. Assuming an approximate 3 inch focal length, several sizes were computed for selected ranges between 10 feet and 1 mile. The only range available from the observer is found on the back of one of his original prints with comments, annotated #2. The comment is as follows:
"...it said it was about a quarter of a mile up."
The range of 1320 feet implies this was estimated. Photograph #2 was used for these calculations as it is the only one with an estimated range available. The results were as follows:
Observer estimated range of - 1320 feet - diameter 2.56 feet
at range of - 10 feet - diameter 1.28 feet
at range of - 15 feet - diameter 1.90 feet
at range of - 20 feet - diameter 2.52 feet
at range of - 30 feet - diameter 3.78 feet
at range of - 50 feet - diameter 6.30 feet
at range of - 100 feet - diameter 12.60 feet
at range of - 1320 feet - diameter 2.11 feet

4. Further analysis would require reliable estimates of distance from camera to object (range) for each photograph and scale focal length of the camera.

Dear Major,

As per our telephone conversation of Friday, May 13, I am sending you all the information I have on this reported UFO.
I have no personal comment on its being right or wrong, but at the behest of authorities at Fort Monmouth, N.J., I am sending it all to you.

In regard to your questions:
1. The 3.00 camera used has two positions, under 15 feet and from 15 to 300 feet.
2. The UFO was first seen, he says, at about 3,000 feet. Then dropped down to 600 to 750 feet.
3. The inexpensive camera has no "f" stops, only a spring-operated shutter.
4. It uses 120 film, kodak, and the film was developed locally.
5. The camera is a Fals, or something like that. Not a standard make.

I hope this will help you. I would appreciate your returning the film, if at all possible.

Sincerely,
Frank L. Wilgus

The image appears to contain a newspaper article with a photograph of a person. The article discusses a "saucer-shaped object" that was reportedly seen by a 13-year-old boy who took pictures of it. The article provides details about the encounter, including the boy's description of the object and the fact that it hovered over his house for several minutes before flying away. No other photographs are visible in this particular page.

THE DAILY REGISTER (NEW JERSEY) 12 MAY 1966

He thinks he saw a window in the object shape of a dome. The base and top of the object was covered with lights that looked like windows but he was afraid to look at them closely, he said he took five pictures, but only three came out clear, he said. The object remained visible for about 15 minutes before it took off he added.

His mother, Mrs. Elsie Salvo, added that she was not sure it was a flying saucer but her children saw it and her son decided to take some pictures. 

His sister, Miss Dee Salvo, said that she had been an object flashing blue, red and white lights. She followed it, she said, as it moved across the sky.

The colorful lights were teardrop-shaped and seemed to be flashing in a random manner, the boy said.

"As the object began rising, they seemed to bunch up and then spread out again as if they were well organized in formation," he was quoted.

He was frightened that night. "It was very close and seemed to go very high and I was curious to know just how high it was. It flew from east to west direction," he added.

The boy, in sixth grade, said his sighting was observed by his sister, grade-school playmates, other citizens and housewives on a nearby street. They ran outside of their homes, he said, to see the object and to watch it fly off in a southerly direction.

A short time after the sighting, the boy said, the Army and local Civil Defense Offices were notified and came to the house to investigate the incident. Several pictures of the object were taken, he said, but he does not know whether the Army or the Civil Defense Office kept any of them. The boy said the pictures were released to the public.

The article describes how Robert Salvo, a 13-year-old boy from Wall Township, New Jersey, took photographs of an unidentified flying object (UFO) using his 35-cent camera. The Army then obtained the photographs from Salvo and sent them to the Air Force for investigation. The article provides details about Salvo's experience and the subsequent actions taken by the Army regarding the UFO photographs.

Robert said,"I heard a loud whirring sound and looked upwards." This object, according to him, shot out of a cloud, hovered and then quickly disappeared. The incident took place on March 29th according to Robert. Photographs and Robert's report were submitted to the Air Force (NICAP) and Director of Cloaking and Decoying Control office that night, but no firm conclusion could be made as yet. Robert was not released until investigators checked his story and the area.

Ft. Monmouth Mum on 'Saucer' Photo
Wall Twp. Boy, 13, Has Picture
By LADLEY E. PEARSON
Staff Correspondent
WALL TOWNSHIP, N.J. -- The Army has the pictures and just won't talk about them.
What the Army calls "classified" and the Wall Township lad calls a "flying saucer" was the center of much speculation around Monmouth County and just talk on May 11.
Well, a 13-year-old boy took some pictures on March 30, authorities say, of what he believes was a flying saucer over the Monmouth County Civil Defense headquarters here.
The youth showed the photos to the Army, which has not commented on them.
THE YOUTH said he was walking his dog along the Mueller gravel pit here when he suddenly saw the strange object in the sky. He snapped several pictures and brought a print to a neighbor.
The neighbor, Frank L. Wilgus, said the boy was "excited and nervous" and reported seeing the strange craft hovering in the sky and then zooming off.
Wilgus turned the photographs over to Army authorities, who held them until yesterday. He said an examination revealed the negatives were probably authentic.
THE ARMY has not released the pictures or commented on them. Wilgus said he was told the pictures are being studied and no further information would be given out.
The youth, who was not identified, made no public announcement of his sighting. He and his family have refused to discuss the incident. The Army also refused to comment.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is a letter from the Chief, Civil Branch, Community Relations Division of the Office of Information, addressed to "Mr. ___", forwarding a UFO report and negatives for analysis.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. ____,

Your letter to the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base forwarding a UFO report and negatives has been referred to this office for reply. Project Blue Book, the Air Force UFO program, has evaluated the photos taken by Mr. _____ on ________ and negatives are enclosed and we would appreciate your returning them to Mr. _____.

Information for a more detailed analysis would include focal length of the camera and lens data. Due to having only the front position available, a check was made of local sources to determine the focal length. We found no such camera, but a check of this type normally would be standard procedure to establish the focal length.

Further analysis would require reliable estimates of distance parameters to the object (range) for each photograph and exact focal length of the camera.

In view of the foregoing, we have placed your report in our Unidentifiable Data Category. Reports containing such as this are those for which one or more elements of information essential for evaluation are missing.

Thank you for your interest in our program.

1. Reference the attached UFO report and negative which were forwarded to the Civil Defense and Disaster Control Organization, Freehold, New Jersey. The photograph represents the property of the Civil Defense and Disaster Control Organization and a copy is attached for your information.

2. Information necessary for a more detailed analysis would include focal length of the camera, exposure, and film data. Since this data is not available from local sources to determine the focal length. This revealed only typical photographs which were probably made for premium distributions. A camera of this type would normally make approximately three inch images. Assuming an approximate 36 inch focal length lens, the object subtends an angle of approximately 0.027 degrees and appears to have an estimated size of approximately three feet. Assuming an approximate three foot object is supported as indicated from camera data available from the observer is found on the back or one of his previous photographs. A range of approximately 1350 feet is used to calculate the subtend angle and subsequent size estimates of distance from camera to object (range) for each photograph.
