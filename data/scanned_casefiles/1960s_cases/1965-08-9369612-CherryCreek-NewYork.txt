Landing Probed by
NICAP, AF

A curious landing report, in New York state on Aug. 19, has been thoroughly checked by NICAP, state police and five-man AF team. This sighting, which occurred on the William Butcher dairy farm near Cherry Creek, N.Y., involved three members of the Butcher family and a fourth witness. Here is their report:

At 8:30 p.m., Harold Butcher, 16, was operating a milking machine in a dairy barn housing 17 cows. A portable radio on the wall was turned to a newscast, when a sudden static-like interference drowned it out. Then the tractor, which ran the milking machine abruptly stopped. A moment later, a Holstein bull secured outside began to bellow and pull at a steel bar to which it was chained.

Young Butcher ran to a window and saw a large elliptical object nearing the ground, a fourth of a mile away. A reddish vapor could be seen underneath, and he heard a steady beep-beep sound. The UFO was on the ground only a few seconds, then it shot straight up, disappearing in low clouds.

When other witnesses came out, after Harold Butcher phoned the house, they noted a strange odor, also a greenish glow in the clouds where the UFO had vanished. Meantime, it was found that the bull had bent the steel bar in his efforts to get loose.

Half an hour later, when the strange craft reappeared, circling the area, Mrs. Butcher called State police. Two troopers investigated, notified the AF. Next day, Capt. James Dorsey, Operations Officer, 1621st AF Group, arrived near AF technicians.

(When they examined the ground, an odd greenish liquid substance was discovered at several places. Small unexplained marks, two patches of singed grass and foliage.

After the AF team left, NICAP member Jeffrey Gow obtained samples of the purplish substance and singed foliage, and samples were studied by the Keyworth Chemical Co., whose president is a NICAP advisor. Spectrographic analysis showed the main element of the liquid to be aluminum, iron and silicon. Some phosphorus was found in the seed samples. Keyworth officials said might cause a phosphine smell, explaining the odd odor.

On the night following the Cherry Creek incident, State Trooper Richard Ward, a few miles from this area, watched an object with eight circular lights in line flying twice as fast as a jet. It emitted a faint, unfamiliar purring sound.

Dr. Fred C. Fair and John Maxwell, of NICAP New York Subcommittee No. 2, carefully checked the Cherry Creek site and questioned the witnesses. On the basis of present evidence, they believe the report is genuine. Dr. Fair has contacted state troopers who investigated also seem to be convinced.

Dept Dorsey, Niagra AFB, phone autovin 231-2360; commercial area code 716- 297-1100 ext 351.

We received UFO report from State Police, Chautauqua County Police Barracks, Fredonia, New York. Object sighted near Cherry Creek, New York.

Object initial seen 2020 EDT (few minutes after sunset). Saucer shaped object, looked like two dinner plates held face to face silver, very shiny, 50 ft long, 20 ft thick. Landed in farm field about 400 feet from barn. (At least it appeared to land). First observer 15 years old, Aldrich Hill Road, Cherry Creek, New York. Had a radio on in the barn and had unusual interference, went outside, beep-beep on radio. Then he went outside the object rapidly ascended into the clouds, clouds turned green (color of tree leaves) emitted red streak, had unusual odor, like a city. 4-5 minutes later object descended down, slowly ascended into clouds, clouds turned green like trees, it was still light outside. This observation 16 years old, Limestone, New York, 16 years old. At 2100 object descended (this was about x 1/2 hr later from first observation) 1000 ft away from barn, ascended back into clouds, went to the South-southwest direction, emitting yellow streak, descended and ascended several times. Last time the observation was also made by Jr 17 years and years old (brothers) no adults. Parents were in house. described small as white gas burning. Parents confirmed that the dog was barking, the cattle gave 2 1/2 cans of milk ordinarily and last night they only gave 1 can, they had a bull inthe field and he was upset. The State Police Impression was that it could be a hoax but he did not feel that it was a hoax as the people were rural people. State Patrolman S J Haas was the interviewer. Couldn't see any marks on the ground it was dark when he got there, low clouds in Niagra area, 1,300 - 2,000 broken overcast. There was a woods behind the object. Thought the kids were stunned by observation. They will send a UFO.

CHERRY CREEK, NEW YORK
19 AUGUST 1965

The witness was working in a barn when he noticed unusual AM radio interference plus a being sound. When he went outside he saw an object which he described as being saucer shaped like two plates lip to lip. The object was described as 50 feet long and 20 feet thick; its color was shiny silver with red glowing streamers projecting downward from the entire perimeter plus a trail of red to yellow color. The object was reported to have appeared to a land near the farm and when the observer sighted it, the object rapidly ascended into the clouds. The clouds then turned green (color of tree leaves) and an odor like burning gasoline from the object was also noted.

Four to five minutes later the object reappeared descending slowly from the clouds over a wooded area and then rose again into the clouds emitting a dim red trail. The clouds again turned green near the object. The object reappeared at 2100 hours, descending toward the surface. It then rose to a height above the clouds and moved away SSW, while emitting yellow trail.

The object was reported to have caused reduction in the milk from the farmer's cow from 23 cans to 1 can, disturbed a bull in the field, and caused a dog to bark.

COMMENTS

The State Police patrolman who interviewed the witnesses said it was his impression that the sighting could be a hoax, but he did not feel that it was, as the people were rural people. Also, the investigating officer and three technicians were convinced that the sighting was not a hoax or fabrication. One technician remained unconvinced.

No physical evidence of a vehicle or landing was found except an oily substance which was found to be a combination Vis strigren or Gentian Violet plus 3-in-one oil, which is not believed to be connected with this sighting.

Although the sequence of events are dubious, the sighting is carried as unidentified by the Air Force since there is no definite concrete explanation.
