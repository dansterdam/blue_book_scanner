CHERRY CREEK, NEW YORK - AUGUST 9, 1965

On January 8, 1965, the Air Force received a letter from a Mrs. XXX of Cherry Creek, New York, regarding a reported UFO sighting by her husband, Mr. XXX, on August 9, 1964. 

The major details of the report are as follows:

On August 9, 1964, at approximately 10:00 p.m., Mr. XXX observed a bright red-orange light in the sky over his home. The light was stationary at first, then began moving slowly to the northwest. It would then stop and hover, then move again. This pattern continued for approximately 30 minutes. 

Mr. XXX stated the object was approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length and gave off a bright glow. He reported that the object seemed to be under intelligent control, and that it disappeared from view by simply blinking out.

No other witnesses to the sighting were reported. This is the extent of the information contained in the Project Blue Book file on this particular case.

Landing Probed by 
NICAP, AF

A curious landing report in New York state on Aug. 19 has been thoroughly checked by NICAP, and five witnesses have been interviewed. This incident occurred on the William Butcher dairy farm near Cherry Creek, N.Y., involving three members of the Butcher family and a fourth person, Mrs. Marie Wojtl ...

Capt. Dorsey, flight k-53, phone autovan 231-2360; commercial open code U.S. 907-11-909 ext 57. 
To received two report from State Police, Chautauqua County Police Barracks, Fredonia, New York. Object sighted near Cherry Creek, New York.
Object initial seen 2030 EDT (few minutes after sunset). Saucer shaped object, light brown in color like two dinner plates held together, very shiny, 50 ft long, 20 ft thick. Landed in farm field about 400 feet from barn (at least it appeared to land). First observer ******* 25 years old, Aldrich Hill Road, Cherry Creek, New York. Had a radio on in the car and heard unusual interference, went outside to look. When he went outside the object rapidly ascended into the clouds. Clouds turned green (color of tree leaves) shifted and streaked, had unusual odor, like ****. This mixture went straight back, slowed descended into clouds, cloud turned green like grass, it was still insight outside. This observation was made by ******* **********, Fredonia, New York. 15 minutes observer started home towards barn but went back into clouds. Started (direction) 2300 ft. away from barn, moved back into clouds, went to the south-southwest direction, emitting yellow streak, descended and ascended several times. Last time the observation was also made by ******* ****** (brothers) no adults. Parents were in house. Dog described small as white gas burning. Parents confirmed that dog was barking, the cattle were 24 2 mile ordinarily and not what they only came 1 am. They had a bull in the field and he was upset. The State Police impression was that it could be a hoax but he did not feel that it was a hoax as the people were rural people. State Patrolman J.S. Haas was the interviewer. Couldn't see smoke on the ground it was dark when he got there, but clouds in figure area, 1,200 - 3,000 broken overhead. There was a woods behind the object. Thought the kids were stunned by observation. They will send a report.

CHERRY CREEK, NEW YORK
19 AUGUST 1965

The witness was working in a barn when he noticed unusual AM radio interference plus a beeping sound. When he went outside he saw an object which he described as being shaped like a disc plating a little color. The object was hovering and had red glowing streamers projecting downward from the entire perimeter plus a white spotlight to have appeared to have moved to the clouds. The clouds then turned green (color of tree leaves) and an odor like burning gasoline was noted.

Four to five minutes later the object reappeared descending slowly from the clouds and then ascended back up into the clouds emitting a white light again. The object disappeared at 2100 hours, descending toward the surface. No landing or take-off was noted.

The object was reported to have caused reduction in the milk from the farmer's cow from 25 cans to 14 cans, disturbed a dog which began to bark.

The State Police patrolman who interviewed the witnesses said it was his impression that the sighting could not be a hoax, but he did not feel that it was an airplane or anything earthly. No physical evidence or landing was found except an oily substance which was found to be a combination of stringent or German violet plus 3-nitro-oil which is not believed to be connected with this incident.

Although the sequence of events are dubious, the sighting is classified as unidentified by the Air Force since there is no definite concrete explanation.
