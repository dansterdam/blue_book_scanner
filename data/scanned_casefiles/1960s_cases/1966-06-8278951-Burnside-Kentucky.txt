Major Hector Quintanella, Jr.

Headquarters Air Force Bases
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanella:

This letter is to report an incident that occurred on June 16, 1966 between 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM E.D.T. I observed this incident while at home with my family. The sighting occurred immediately, and it looked like a bright object that seemed to be hovering or stationary in the sky. This object discharged some form of light that appeared to be flashing or pulsating in a pattern that repeats itself. I am forwarding this report to you, please accept my apology.

Yours truly,
Robert Burnside
Burnside, Kentucky
June 16, 1966

View this. As we emerged from the brush, I could see the lights were much like automobile headlights, but the oblong shape were now almost like the low beam of an automobile headlights. These oblong shapes as the low beam of an automobile headlights were now almost at a standstill and I can now see them as they then began to rise slowly, illuminating the whole countryside. It was a dim, very slow on the right, it was speeding of my bright. Then they seemed to ascend very deliberately and took on great speed. They seemed to be about 200 yards east of my house. Then deliberately the lights seemed to slow down a hit, and in a few seconds, tremendous speed again as they seemed to go straight up, the red and green slow had changed to a clear whitish color. And as they ascended, I could see clearly the oblong shape, and I could now see this one was also illumined by the red and green lights that had been seen earlier on the right. And the green one on the left. Now as I watched, I saw three or four more of these go up in the same manner - they ascended very slowly at first, then took on tremendous speed and went straight up in the sky. Now, the original and the now light ascended toward the sky together. It seemed strange these lights were so powerful, yet so slow in speed near the ground. Then this position I saw the lights momentarily and they disappeared as if they had an instantaneous on and off, just disappeared in the sky.
