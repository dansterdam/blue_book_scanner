Burnside, Kentucky
June 16, 1966

Major Hector Quintanella, Jr.
Project Bluebook

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanella:

The purpose of this letter is to report an incident that occurred at my home in Burnside, Kentucky on June 14, 1966 between 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM E.S.T. I reported this incident to the local authorities immediately, but since their response has been so apathetic I am sending this account directly to you. It may be that this incident is of no significance to your office if so, please accept my apology.

To make sure that this report is free of conjectures and imagination I will report my findings exactly as I experienced them.

On June 14th at approximately 8:30 PM my brother, who was visiting from Oklahoma, and I retired to the patio of my home. We were involved in a discussion of U.S. Agriculture when I casually surveyed the eastern horizon over a clump of trees. In the direction of Easy-Southeast a star of usual intensity was visible in the exceptionally clear sky. Immediately below this star appeared two additional stars. At least I thought they were stars about one inch apart and varying on a line parallel to the earth. These two additional stars prompted me to take a more concentrated look because they appeared to be flashing instead of twinkling. As they were rapidly becoming brighter, I called my brother's attention to these flashing lights, (I had then realized that they were not stars). He studied them momentarily and then remarked that it appeared to him an object traveling along a zig-zag course directly toward us. He and I viewed this for a short period (probably about two minutes) then as the lights became more intense and the distance between them had grown to about one foot, I went into the house to get my wife and sister-in-law to

view this. As we emerged from the house the lights were
much lower and much closer with the distance between them
being about three (3) feet. The lights were now almost as
large as the low beam of automobile headlights, there
increasing as we drew nearer the two flashing white lights.
In a very brief period of time the red glow was joined by
a dim green slow on the right ( I am speaking of my right
as I looked directly at the lights). The forward progress
of the lights now ceased momentarily when they seemed to
be about 200 yards east of my house. Then deliberately
the direction of the lights were changed along a course
few degrees (probably less than 30°) toward the south.
At this time the red and green slow had changed to a sharp
red flashing light and a green flashing light. The
route passing light and sharp green flashing light, red
and green lights were now as clear as a traffic
light. The distance from a point of ½ block - It was now clear
that the red and green lights were centered between the
white and red and slightly above them, with the red one on
the left (my left) and the green one on the right. The
lights now proceeded along their new course at a velocity
of less than 5 miles per hour. As they crossed over the
street in front of my house, the distance between the white
and red lights increased to about the same as the distance
between the headlights of an automobile. As the lights moved
over the colored light were forward
of the white lights. The lights were now at a near point
both to my house and to a point about 100 to 150 feet
beyond the main distance but well within the range of a 22
rifle. In this position the lights were at the electrical
generating plant, located about 1000 feet from my house's
heart. The white light nearest to my position was now reflected
off a surface immediately above the light. This reflection
was not bright. As the lights had proceeded about 100 feet forward
surface, the lights had proceeded about 100 feet forward
when a seam cut slightly dimmer red light appeared about
20 feet to the right and slightly below the original lights.
Then both the original and the new red light moved forward.
A distance of less than 100 feet. At this time the new red
light slowly moved to a position directly behind and slightly
below the original lights. They now continued forward at
the same slow rate until they disappeared behind a grove of
trees. I quickly ran about 200 feet west to break in the
trees. At this position I saw the lights momentarily and
then disappeared as if they had suddenly turned turned
off.

The above events are described as accurately as my eye can see and as well as my pen can write. I have never before observed a flying object that I could not identify, but I am convinced that with I saw was real and unconventional.
