I received assargseants rating in 1928 from the R. O. T. C. at Missouri University. In the Infantry. I hate communism, and please excuse the typing and secretarial errors. If you all want me to place an atomic bomb by dropping me and it on some future or distant battle field or enemy installation don't hesitate to call on me. I so often think of the Magionet Line and everything was figured out on paper to be perfect but the Germans did great new fox holes for their front line sergants and corporals and we all know what happened.

INTELLIGENCE
Pentagon
Washington D. C.

Dear Capitalistic Friends,

While waiting to go to church (Now 9:40AM Sunday morning Standard Mountain Time) I read "The Family Fallout Shelter MP-15". My fellow chemists and other professional bourgeoise "poh poohed" my efforts to prepare for and defend ourselves for an all out Atomic War, ever since Hiroshima.

The Powers case is your "baby".

On May 12 at 8:40 PM Standard Mountain Time I was sitting on the north ledge of the East entrance of the main building at Mark Kegel High School in the Alhambra School District of California. From what I told [redacted] on military observation of plane movements I estimate I saw a flying saucer traveling toward me and somewhat east. If interested I can take one of your military men and show the approximate movement between a tree and a light pole about a block away. As I first saw it in my bifocals I thought it might be a light refraction. But I took them off and it looked like a morning star (reddish like mars) except it had somewhat of a cross extension something like a spine on a echinodermate.

I awaited for it to pass by in my line of vision past the cross arm of the light pole. It disappeared. A Stat was visable in that same area that remained about the same, but no visable movement.

I have told now one about it. I was alone and I don't usually take a breather on the East side of the Night School only on the North. And I'm not making my carbon copy.

Yours for Truth,
[signature redacted]
San Gabriel, Ca.

P. S. You can see why now I'm not mailing "Lady's Chattington Lover" to Pasadena U. S. Post Office Inspector at Room 202 Pasadena, California.

for I don't know how many fascists are taking over the government but I know were I stand in "The Faith of Our Fathers."

Dear Friends,

I've misplaced my first letter to you about the light I saw floating over a year ago at Mark Keppel High School at night. And I was surprised that you even wanted any additional information from me. I've also misplaced or lost page 1 and 2 of your forms, but like Xerxes of old who couldn't sleep when he caused the Book of the Kings of Assyria to be read to him and found out about Mordecai saving his life, I as a master sergeant for God should, since a law abiding citizen, mail you back the forms I completed months ago, and at that time I had the first page too.

If you'll give me a copy of my letter relating to this and the first forms with the others I can mail them back with any information I have stored in the SECRET part of my brain. But I really doubt if that is really important as now-a-days we are getting away from Desk Sergeants.

I'll really believe in our form of Democracy when all rated R.O.T.C. sergeants are retired on a pension like Eisenhowers and one stenographer instead of $83.00 monthly Social Security check which they won't even pay unless we volunteer to be executed like the Two Veterans killed years ago in a Gulfport hospital.

Without Military training I wouldn't have been in my own church, which church I now request to admit qualified Colored Persons on one Summer Sunday in 1953. I disturbed no one but a Mississippi Poll-Tax citizen who "so efficiently" deprived me of a lawyer.
