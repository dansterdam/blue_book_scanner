TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 1968

The rest of the text is part of the weather map and is mostly illegible due to the image quality. The map shows various "HIGH" and "LOW" pressure systems with curved lines representing weather patterns across what appears to be a map of the United States.


- page 16 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

HOH
MOT

The rest of the document appears to be a series of maps or charts with curved lines, grid patterns, and circular/swirling shapes, but the text is too faint or blurry to definitively transcribe. The document looks like it might be a meteorological or scientific diagram of some kind.

MONDAY, JUNE 3, 1968

[The rest of the text appears to be part of a weather map with labels such as "HIGH" and "LOW", but the specific details are not clearly legible due to the image quality.]


- page 18 -

Text found in the image:

HIGH

The image appears to be a topographical or meteorological map with contour lines and some annotations. The word "HIGH" is visible, likely referring to a high-pressure system or elevation contour. The rest of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly.


- page 19 -

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 5, 1968

The rest of the text is part of the weather map and appears to be labels like "LOW" and "HIGH" on various parts of the map, but these are not complete sentences or paragraphs that can be fully transcribed. The image appears to be a meteorological map showing weather patterns and pressure systems across a geographic region.


- page 20 -

The text in the image is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The image appears to show a page with two sections - one with a sketch or diagram on the right side and another section on the left side with what seems to be text or another diagram, but the details are not clear enough to read accurately.


- page 21 -

THURSDAY, JUNE 6, 1968

[The rest of the text is part of the weather map and is mostly illegible due to the low resolution of the image. The map shows various "LOW" pressure areas and contour lines, typical of a meteorological surface weather chart.]


- page 22 -

The text in the image is mostly illegible due to the low quality of the scan. The document appears to be a technical diagram or chart with contour lines and some text labels that read "HGHT" (possibly meaning "height"), but the specific details are too blurry to make out clearly.

The document appears to be a topographical or meteorological map with contour lines and some scattered text. The left side of the document contains a detailed contour map with curved lines, while the right side appears to have a more scattered pattern of dots or markings. However, most of the smaller text is too illegible for me to confidently transcribe.

UFO Observation, 15 June 1968

Dayton, Ohio 45424

Our investigations indicate that you probably saw a weather balloon that was launched from Sulfur Grove Weather Station. Ordinarily, they launch the balloons at 6:00 pm plus or minus 1 hr. These balloons can be seen for as long as 1½ hours on a clear day. The actual balloon is on top under which is attached a hoop to stabilize the parachute which returns the payload to the ground. A cable hangs down from the balloon and at the end the small payload is attached.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

                                                          Rec. Jan 24, 69

Dear Sirs,

I am writing to you on
account of the book on letters to
you, printed in 1967 which I have
come across.

My family and I spotted a
UFO one Saturday night while
watching TV. It was during the
summer (1968) and our front door was
open, and slowly my brother called
our attention to a small hovering
light a few miles away. It was a
white light. We started to move
up and to the north, as it moved
in big to pick up speed. In
about 5 mins. it was over our house
and changing color from white
to light green to pink and then to
white again. I have watched my
telescope to look at it.

Description: It was a light orange color.
It was made up of a half circle with what looked
like a huge, huge, retractable antenna
on the back.

Dear Sirs,

In June of 68 I saw two flying saucers hovering with their lights climaxing first, who are in of the night from one to the other. But she tells me something I will fly up. So I am enclosing my statement.

Sincerely,
Victor Sandquist

P.S. Tell me what the phenomenon is and give me some more info for my enclosed set flying saucers.

The image appears to be a hand-drawn grid or diagram with numbered sections from 1 to 8. The grid is drawn on lined paper and consists of rectangular sections. Some sections contain small sketches or symbols, but the details are not clearly legible. The drawing seems to be a rough sketch or map of some kind.

DR. JALLEN HYNEK

Because of the conversation between Lt Col Quintanilla and Dr. Craig, of the Univ of Colorado, Col Quintanilla does not feel that a vet analysis of the sample, to determine carbon content would be justified. Because the sample is not from the continental U.S. a we aren't sure if we could justify getting the work done anyhow. I'm sorry to have been of so little help on this sample. The sample is inclosed and is undamaged in any way.

Subj: Physical Specimen From Canada

Reference conversation between Dr. Craig, University of Colorado
and Lt Colonel Quintanilla, Aerial Phenomena Office on 17 June
1968. Dr. Craig personally investigated the matter and stated
that the object could not have come from the sky since there was no
evidence of any impact and that it (the object) was definitely terrestrial
in nature.

Comments:

First of all I question the conclusions reached by Mr. Reichold. He identified the metallic material as a austenite high - manganese steel. Commercial austenite manganese steel usually contains 1-11/2% and 10-14% Mn in addition to other alloying additions in small amounts. A primary factor is the apparent total lack of any carbon, a element found in basically all steels. Some of the austenite stainless steel contain about a 0.05 maximum carbon content, but these steels contain 11-18% chromium and usually some nickel.

Accepting a large percentage view in their analysis I could agree that the material is nothing more than a common steel. This is of course so if some carbon were present. Have a semi-quantitative spectrographic analysis was made these to some for error -

Subj: UFO Sighting of 16 June 1968

Called Cox Municipal FAA. They reported that they had no records of the Goodyear blimp being in town on the 16 of June. Suggested that I call Patterson FAA since Patterson sometimes controls the blimp. At 0845 called Patterson FAA and was informed that the information was not available and that they could not tell me. They suggested that I call Cox.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Department of Astronomy
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois 60201

Dear Dr. Hynek:

Thank you for your letter of inquiry concerning the 1000 lb. piece of metal being held by the Canadian Government which is believed by some people to be a crashed UFO. Unfortunately, I had assumed that you had personal access to this metal through the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book and Air Technical Intelligence. The piece of metal which I am submitting was cut from a larger piece in my possession. The original 1000 lb. piece measuring about 6 x 7 feet and 1-1/2 feet thick is in the custody of Bill Riddell, who was Wilbert Smith's assistant and now directs the UFO study in Canada. I also have photographs of the original piece. There is considerable romance behind the conditions under which the metal was found during the latter part of June 1960, 20 miles north of Quebec City on the edge of the St. Lawrence River. This information is also available upon your request.

I am enclosing a copy of the complete analysis made by John F. Rowland, Senior Scientist Officer, Physical Chemistry Section, Mines Scientific Surveys, Mines Branch, Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, Ottawa, Canada using X-ray diffraction and spectographic techniques. In his summary you will note, that it is almost certain to have been concluded that it is almost certain to have been of terrestrial rather than of meteoric origin.

The article by John Fuller in the May 14 issue of Look Magazine was very revealing concerning the attitude of Dr. Edward Condon and Project Blue Book to this scientific research project. It will be a serious setback to the study of the UFO phenomena if their report is negative in nature as implied by the tone of the article. This was a report in Look, dated 1966 to University officials prior to signing the contract which is the key to the lack of good faith under which the project was undertaken and apparently conducted. "To the scientists and the student of the UFO phenomena, the University of Colorado Project could be the blunder of the century."

I will be very interested in obtaining your analysis of this metal for comparative purposes. Robert Q. Achzehner of Villa Park, Illinois advised me that he has given a piece of this same metal to your colleague, Fred Beckman at the University of Chicago for study. Bob Achzehner and I are co-chairmen of the Illinois Section of Aerial Phenomena Research Organization with headquarters in Tucson, Arizona. I am very proud to have organized the first such statewide section, which has since spread from Connecticut to Hawaii.

If I can be of further assistance, please call upon me, because I do appreciate the interest you have shown to date.

EXAMINATION OF AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT RECEIVED FROM A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT, OTTAWA, IN DECEMBER, 1960

by
John F. Rowland*

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

An unidentified aerial object, which was received from a representative of the Department of Transport, Ottawa, has been examined by X-ray diffraction and spectographic techniques. The irregularly-shaped, metallic object was identified as metallic high-manganese steel. It is almost certain to have been of terrestrial rather than of meteoric origin.

On December 10, 1968, an irregularly-shaped mass of a silvery metal was submitted to the Mineral Sciences Division by Mr. E.K. Swirming of the Technical Services Division of the Mines Branch. The material had been received from a representative of the Department of Transport, Ottawa, and was described as an unidentified aerial object. The requested identification was done by X-ray diffraction and spectrographic analyses in the Physical Chemistry and Analytical Chemistry Sections, respectively.

The surface condition indicated that the object had been subjected to high temperatures. Preliminary tests showed that the material was very weakly ferromagnetic.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES

X-ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained of material taken from a freshly-exposed metallic surface of the sample, and of the soft, brown deposit present on portions of the surface as received. The patterns were obtained using 57.3 mm diameter Debye-Scherrer powder camera and Fe Kα radiation.

The films were interpreted by comparison with data published in the X-ray Powder Data File issued by the American Society for Testing Materials, and by direct comparison with available standard films. The value of the unit-cell dimension of the cubic compound, which was the predominant constituent of the metallic object, was

Lines. Since the lines were broad, accurate measurements could
not be made, and the calculated unit-cell dimension can be considered
only as an approximation.

The unidentified aerial object was submitted to the
Analytical Chemistry Section, where a portion was filed off and,
from this, a semi-quantitative spectrographic analysis was obtained.

The results of this analysis were provided to the Physical Chemistry
Section, and were correlated with the X-ray diffraction inter-
pretations.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the metallic
portion of the sample was interpreted as representing diffraction
from the following compounds:-

1) predominant constituent: face-centered cubic compound
with unit-cell dimension, a = 3.62A approximately;
corresponds to a gamma-iron solid solution as
found in austenitic steel (austenite), e.g., nickel-
bearing and manganese-bearing types, and to
meteoric iron (taenite).

2) trace constituents: quartz and calcite.

The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the small amounts
of not known material on the surface of the aerial object was

Here is the OCR text from the document:

1) major constituent: magnetite, Fe3O4

2) large minor constituent: spinel-type compound, close to magnetite, Fe3O4

3) small minor constituent: goethite, α-Fe2O3·H2O

4) trace constituent: lepidocrocite, γ-Fe2O3·H2O

Neither X-ray diffraction pattern showed any indication of any other crystalline constituents, or of any amorphous material.

The results of the semi-quantitative spectrographic analysis are as follows:

Fe = PC;
Mn = 6; Si = 2; Ni = 0.6;
Cr = 0.3; Cu = 0.2; W = 0.2; Sn = 0.1; Al = 0.1;
Co = 0.04; Mg = 0.03; Pa = 0.02; V = 0.008;
Mo = tr; Ti = tr.

The abbreviations PC and tr. indicate principal constituent and trace, respectively. The figures given are percentages by weight.

CONCLUSIONS

The X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the unidentified material object consisted of a metallic face-centred cubic compound, with a unit-cell dimension agreeing with those of 1) austenitic steel, and 2) meteoric iron. The semi-quantitative spectrographic analysis showed, however, that there was insufficient nickel present for the material to be of meteoric origin. The amount of

being, perhaps detected in the spectrographic analysis, suggests that the
metallic material is best described as high-manganese austenitic
steel. This is consistent with the very weak ferromagnetic nature
of the metal.

The iron oxide, and the hydrated iron oxides on the surface
are normal results of the exposure of steel to the atmosphere. The
amounts of quartz and calcite detected by X-ray diffraction are very
small, and are common extraneous materials.

The low nickel and high manganese content are not
consistent with a meteoric origin, whereas they are consistent
with common high-tensile steels. The object is, therefore, considered
to be of terrestrial origin.

Note: The semi-quantative spectrographic method, because it is designed to handle a very wide variety of materials, can in consequence only furnish approximate results indicating order of magnitude. These results are not, in general, suitable as a basis of major policy decisions or actions; and where results are required for important policy purposes, fully quantitative estimations, either chemical or spectrographic should be required.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                1 July 1968

Subj: UFO Sighting of 16 June 1969

Called Sulfur Grove and asked if they had launched a balloon on
16 June 1968 that would have been able to be seen from 6:45 pm
to 7:20 pm. The weather officer said although the records had been
destroyed it certainly could have been one of their balloons. Ordinarily
they launch the balloons at 6:00 pm plus or minus ½ hr and that the
balloon can sometimes be seen for as long as 1½ hrs. The balloon
is on top under which is attached a hoop to stabilize the parachute. A
cable hangs down from the balloon and at the end a small payload is
attached.

June 1968

Dear Sir -

Many years ago when in the air
here I was aboard a C-47
flying to Washington state (Paine Field)
to rejoin my group which was
assigned there for operation -
whip-sack. It was an F-86
out fit and the only officer I
recall at the present was a
Capt. Scott - who I think my story

[The last line appears to be cut off and incomplete]


- page 63 -

I had seen four UFO's in formation over the state of Oregon on Pacific
California east say for sure which - where
that surely one of the time -
I first spotted thing I thought
they were F-86's but some enlarged


- page 64 -

they were not A/c of a kind known
to me - We were flying north
and the U.F.O's were flying south

altitude of C-97 approx 9000 to 10000
ft. U.F.O's approx 200 ft. below our
200 ft. to our right - sky overcast
visibility clear, it was daylight.
time of day was 13:00 hrs. or there
about -

The following is path of flight of UFO's
shall see -

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB,
OHIO 45433

Dear Col. Quintanilla;

A matter of a week or so ago, I recall reading in our news paper and hearing on the television news, that the UFO is something out of a sick mind, that the UFO can not come from outer-space. Sir, this is insufficient and I can not buy it.

There are space-ships and very real, as to where they come from, like the Air Force and Project Blue Book, I like-wise don't know, but I can tell you, they are real!

Believe me, I am not a nut or am I looking for fame, I'm only trying to make you people realize that UFO's are flying around!

As to what kind of beings they may be or as to what kind of power they use or cause is unknowing to me, I can only say, I have my own ideas on that matter.

It is, in my mind, that, is very possible for them to come from outer-space and time is of no matter. However, if this is not true, then they come from the USSR or the USA and I doubt this very much.

I would appreciate it very much that we get the truth once and for all on this matter.

Sincerely,
[Signature area is blacked out]

21. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUEST
ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

My boyfriend and I were leaving Sat. 5:00am June 1, 1968 to
his ranch in the Daly. He went outside to wash up his truck at
same turning inside and told me to look at this. So I went
over to the living room window which faces west low towards
Sun 15 miles. So, San Francisco area and then it was. I
was too close to be mistaken for an airplane or whatever.

It had a beam of light shining down at an angle.
It also held a ring of haze around it sort of like a
light fog. But the light stopped at the sky + stars were
very clear around it. A very small circle, started to
form in the center and it kept getting bigger + by you
and as it became as big as the hazy 1/2 size the
beam of light and the haze disappeared. Then the
object moved slowly to the right in a straight line
then shot backwards which would be straight out
to sea from where I was standing. I watched
this for a good twenty minutes. I don't know how
long it was there before I saw it. But my
boyfriend watched it for about the middle before

Object was self-luminous (as the moon), with a trailing of mist at sides and behind; there were rays of light shining from object through mist (as the sun shines through clouds). After perhaps 2 minutes the object dimmed and what seemed to be a circle of black moved out from the object, completely encircling it -- I believe this was an illusion as the mist was clearing from nearest the object out.

Object did not appear to change shape or size, merely dimmed in brightness.

The smoke was the slightest most slowing in #15, as to the changing of brightness, flash or flicker, it seemed to dim for an instant like a slight build during a storm, when this happened the slogan began to disappear from around object, it appeared as a large black ring slipping from object outward until only the bright phenomena remained. I just saw the last sight of it, it appeared to be slightly bright again, and looked as though the slogan were starting to re-appear shortly.

"Complains About 'A'
UFO Procedure

To the Editor:
I would like to tell you about an incident that happened last Sunday evening at approximately 7 p.m. We were sitting on the front porch when we noticed what appeared to be an UFO. After observing that it did not seem to move my husband got the binoculars to see what it was. It was a flat object with three cables straight out behind it and one short one on the front that hung down. I called the city desk at The Dispatch and they gave me a number at L.A.F.B. where I should report it.

After talking with a young man for almost a half-hour I got disgusted and put my husband on the phone. He, too, got disgusted at the stupid questions that were asked of him, told the young man at L.A.F.B. he was getting the third degree, that he was only trying to report something to him, and hung up.

It is pretty sad to think that our Air Force is in the hands of individuals who can't even ask a sensible question. If this is what everyone goes through that wants to report an UFO., then I can understand why people don't wish to get involved. That is the last time we will do it.

Mrs. Harry L. Dunn,
Columbus.

Dear Dr. Hynek,

I called Ridge Ave. Monday night (June 10) to ask your permission to go out after the object described in the enclosed clipping "A". Joel said you were out of town so I did just what you'd expect me to — I went after it anyway.

After I talked to Joel, I called this woman. She seemed intelligent and willing to discuss the sightings. Before long, she was giving me a description of an object which certainly did smack of "jellyfish" and "falling leaf". There were slight observers with two pairs of binoculars.

I made an appointment to see her the next day.

Meanwhile, another person had called her prior letter. This caller, had observed an identical object in the same location the week before. He was driving at the time and decided to track it down. He soon arrived at Bishop Ready High School (1½ miles from downtown) and found an extraordinary kite and an extraordinary kite-flyer. Seems there was an eccentric little fellow, about 30, who lives in a rented room near High & Mount (pretty crummy). He built the kite and transports it to the school ground via City bus (1½). The kite body is 30 inches high, several feet long, and has wide plastic streamers for tails — the longest tail is 249 feet long. The enclosed drawing was made by him. She added the dimensions as given by Mr. In their phone conversation they agreed they had undoubtedly seen the same object. Only thing left is to verify with the kite flyer that he was actually flying it on June 2 at 1900, but he doesn't know how to reach him. As far as I'm concerned, I consider the case closed.

Glad I solved this one so easily, but sorry it wasn't a good juicy Type I which I personally observed from a distance of 10 feet. Better luck(?) next time.

I observed these balloons at 2210 hrs Monday June 10 - (My G-D, I hope they were the balloons). In case you have any cases come up for comparison, my sighting follows:

I was standing in the yard at [redacted], looking directly south. The temperature was 73 - 75, humidity very high, very smoggy, with a high misty overcast. Only objects visible were Jupiter, very hazy, and the full moon, rising very hazy and red.

I noticed a star-like object rising slowly out of the South, heading straight North. It was about -1 in apparent magnitude, and a steady white light. It's motion was slow and continuous, about comparable to "Echo." Through 7 X 50 glasses this object remained a white point source; no other lights, no shape, and no sound. When this object was within a few degrees of the zenith, it began a course change, orbiting over to the east, preserving same smooth flight. It then slowed, finally remaining stationary high in the E. Then it looked several times, with no apparent frequency or pattern, and slowly drifted back toward the S, getting fainter, as if it were climbing.

At intervals of about 5 minutes, three other objects followed, covering the same path across the sky; the only difference being the last three objects did not blink. All objects eventually drifted back toward the South and faded.

These objects definitely could have given the impression that they were under positive control.

"B" Balloons with Lights
To Aid Pollution Study

A battery of lights and spheres will float across Columbus next week, but they won't be flying saucers or any other sort of UFO.

Lights will appear from nowhere, probably hesitate and possibly even blink, then move quickly off in some direction, thus fitting the oft repeated descriptions given of UFOs.

THE LIGHTS will be attached to a series of gas filled balloons that U.S. air pollution scientists will set free in Columbus Monday through Friday to see how weather affects air pollution.

A chief reason for the tests is to find out how winds and other weather conditions spread odors and bothersome gases around a city.

"This kind of information is useful in planning air pollution control programs," the department said.

THE SCHEDULE for releasing the balloons calls for freezing five of them at 8-minute intervals every two hours during three time periods.

The time periods will be from 2 p.m. Monday to 9 a.m. Tuesday; 2 p.m. Wednesday to 9 a.m. Thursday; and from 2 a.m. to 9 a.m. Friday.

At night, the balloons will carry tiny lights. The federal scientists will observe the balloons and will not need assistance from the public.

THE FOUR locations for releasing the balloons will be in the Downtown, in the suburbs, downtown, and around the city.

FL Hayes will be the Downtown location. Three other sites will be selected on the basis of weather conditions, federal officials said.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JUNE 10-16, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map. An explanation may be obtained by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Action AU 149, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

The Surface Weather Map presents the analysis for 7:30 a.m.e.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only in faction of those that are included on the geographical weather maps, and occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps due to lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The temperature isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are read in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24 hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are under lined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

The text in this image is mostly illegible due to the low quality of the scan. The image appears to be a document with two diagrams or charts, one on the left side showing what seems to be a clustered or dotted pattern, and one on the right side with curved contour-like lines and some numerical labels (I can see numbers like 1, 7, 4, and 11). The overall document seems to be part of a scientific or technical report, but the specific details cannot be clearly read.

TUESDAY, JUNE 11, 1968

The rest of the text appears to be part of meteorological charts and maps showing weather patterns with labels like "HIGH" and "LOW" at various points. Due to the nature of the document being a weather map, most of the text consists of numerical coordinates and meteorological notations which are not easily readable in this scanned image.

The text I can clearly read on this document includes:

The right side of the page appears to be a map of the United States with numerous small markings/dots across different regions, but no clear legible text is visible.

The document appears to be a meteorological or geographical chart with contour lines and a map, but much of the smaller text is too blurry to read with certainty.
