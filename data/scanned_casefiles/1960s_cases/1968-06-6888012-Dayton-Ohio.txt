U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/ Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service
DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JUNE 3-9, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weekly Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the surface weather map, the 500-millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Pressure Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from original operational weather analyses prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau.

The surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The 500-millibar Chart presents the height contours and the temperature patterns of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown in feet above sea level. The temperature patterns, together with the dashed lines, are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredths of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

1. ON 6 JUNE 1968, MAJOR J. J. BLEEDIN USAF, AN AEROSPACE PROJECT PILOT AT THIS CENTER, REPORTED SIGHTING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) NEAR DAYTON, OHIO. THE DETAILS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

A. AT APPROXIMATELY 2200 HOURS, MAJOR BLEEDIN WAS DRIVING ALONG OHIO ROUTE 48 APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES SOUTH OF DAYTON, OHIO. HE NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY WHICH APPEARED TO BE APPROACHING HIM AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. HE STOPPED HIS CAR AND WATCHED THE OBJECT AS IT CAME CLOSER. AS IT APPROACHED, HE OBSERVED THAT IT WAS A LENTICULAR-SHAPED OBJECT WITH NUMEROUS LIGHTS AROUND THE RIM. THE OBJECT PASSED OVER HIS CAR AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 500 TO 1000 FEET AND AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 500 TO 800 KNOTS.

B. AFTER PASSING OVER HIS CAR, THE OBJECT MADE A SHARP TURN TO THE LEFT AND HEADED IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION. MAJOR BLEEDIN STATED THAT THE MANEUVER WAS EXECUTED INSTANTANEOUSLY AND WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION. HE ESTIMATED THE DIAMETER OF THE OBJECT TO BE APPROXIMATELY 60 TO 80 FEET.

C. MAJOR BLEEDIN REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO THE NEAREST AIR FORCE INSTALLATION, WHICH WAS WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB. HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE 6511TH TEST SQUADRON (SPECIAL) AT TYNDALL AFB, FLORIDA.

Our investigations indicate that you probably saw a weather balloon that was launched from Wright-Patterson Air Force Station. Ordinarily, they launch the balloons at 6:00 p.m. plus or minus 1 hr. These balloons can be seen for quite some distance depending on the altitude on a clear day. The actual balloon is on top under which is attached a scoop to stabilize the parachute which had at the end the balloon payload is suspended.

NCFO SUMMARY 1965
Dec. jan. 24, 6.9
Dear sir,
I am writing to report an incident that occurred in 1965 which I have some more details.
My family and I sighted a 24'30" oval-shaped while watching TV. It was hovering motionless for sometime. Suddenly it started to move at incredible speed and disappeared into the distance.
I called the military but they seemed disinterested. I thought it was worth reporting it again in case you have more information on similar occurrences. It was a white light a few miles away. It was a definite UFO, it started to move up and to the north at such a high speed that it immediately disappeared.
It could have been a secret military craft, but if that's the case, it was far more advanced than anything I've seen. The change of color from white to light green and then to white again was very surprising.
It was a light orange in color. It was made up of a half circle with what looked like a huge, retractable antenna on the back.

CASE 6888012

PLACE - DAYTON, OHIO
DATE - 6 JUNE 1968

SUBJECTS REPORTED - UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

OBSERVERS - W. BOWERS, A. WEBER, R. HOEMAN

SUMMARY

1. At approximately 2025 hrs. on 6 June 1968, three individuals, W. Bowers, A. Weber, and R. Hoeman, observed several unidentified flying objects in the sky near Dayton, Ohio.

2. The objects were described as being round in shape and displaying a variety of colors, including red, white, and blue.

3. The objects were observed to be maneuvering in the sky for several minutes before disappearing.

4. No conclusive identification of the objects was made.

CONCLUSIONS

The objects sighted by the three individuals remain unidentified. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the nature and origin of the observed phenomena.

Because of the conversation between Lt Col Quintanilla and DR. Craig, of the univ of Colorado, Col quintanilla does not think that a vet analysis of the sample, to determine carbon content would be justified. because the sample is not from the confidence its just getting the work done anyhow. I'm sorry to have been of so little help on this sample. the sample is inclosed and is undamaged in any way.

Reference conversation between Dr. Craig, University of Colorado and Lt Colonel Quintanilla, Aerial Phenomena Office on 17 June 1968. Dr. Craig personally investigated the matter and stated that the object could not have come from the sky since there was no evidence of any impact and that it (the object) was definitely terrestrial in nature.

First of all if question the conclusion reached by NASA. Firstly the identified the intensity in a astronomical type - many seem to indicate a hyphe-many and commercial aircraft many claimed viewed unidentified type-very small. Cornmercial aircraft, mainly control 1-1/4, and 10-1/2 mila in relation to the distance in small amounts. A rimar, factor is the apparent trail of any object, a almost found in hardly. Some of the automatic station could contain about a 0.60 maximum carbon content, but there is little carbon content - 11 - 1813 Commenti und contain more.
Adopting a deep skepticism toward most reports of unidentified flying objects, there needs to be more about conditions of observation and the nature of the observer. The common detail may contain a rumer - mentioning a flame-like phenomenon that could huve a rational explanation.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

Thank you for your letter of inquiry concerning the 1000 lb. piece of metal being held by the Canadian Government which is believed to have come from a crashed UFO. This metal was cut through the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book and Air Technical Intelligence for me from a larger piece in my possession. The original 1000 lb. piece was given to the Canadian Government, and 1/12 feet thick is now on display.

I also have photographs showing the conditions under which the metal was found during the latter part of 1960 on the north of Quebec City on the edge of the St. Lawrence River. This information is also available at the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book.

I am enclosing a copy of the complete analysis made by John F. Royland, for Scientific Chemistry Section, Mineral Sciences Division, Mines Branch, Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, Canada, using X-ray diffraction and spectrographic analysis. He concluded it is not ordinary high-manganese steel. He concluded the material is of extraterrestrial rather than terrestrial origin.

The effects by John Fuller in the May 14 issue of Look Magazine were very comprehensive and I feel satisfied they will be a serious setback to the study of the UFO phenomena if their approach permits too much skepticism to obscure some of the convincing and impressive facts. I hope some of the articles in this issue will contribute to an increased university and scientific interest in the phenomena, which has been lacking.

I will be very interested in obtaining your analysis of this metal for comparative purposes. Roberts O. Acheson of Villa Park, Illinois, advised me that he has given me a piece of this Park, and I am very anxious to have it analyzed at the University of Chicago for study. Bob Achsener and I are co-chairmen of the Illinois Section of the Research Organization with headquarters in Tucson, Arizona. I am very proud to have organized the first such statewide section, which has since spread from Connecticut to California.

If I can be of further assistance, please call upon me, because I do appreciate the interest you have shown to date.

EXAMINATION OF AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT RECEIVED FROM A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT, OTTAWA, ONTARIO, 18 DECEMBER, 1968
by
John E. Rowland

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
An unidentified aerial object, which was received from a representative of the Department of Transport, Ottawa, has been examined by X-ray diffraction and metallographic techniques. The irregularly-shaped, metallic object was identified as austenitic high-manganese steel. It is almost certain to have been of terrestrial rather than of meteoric origin.

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The image appears to be a typed report with text describing the analysis of an "unidentified aerial object" that was submitted to the U.S. Air Force.

The text reads as follows:

On December 30, 1967, an irregular-shaped material was submitted to the Mineral Sciences Division, by Mr. E.K. Swinnerton, of the Technical Services Division of the Mines Branch. The material had been received from a representative of the Department of Transport, Ottawa, and was described as an "unidentified aerial object". The requested identification was done by X-ray diffraction and spectrographic analysis in the Physical Chemistry and Analytical Chemistry Sections, respectively.

The surface condition indicated that the object had been subjected to high temperatures. Preliminary tests showed that the material was very weakly ferromagnetic.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES
X-ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained of material taken from a freshly-exposed metallic surface of the sample. Some of the soft, brown deposit present on portions of the surface was also analyzed. The patterns were obtained using 57.3 mm diameter Debye-Scherrer powder cameras and Fe Kα radiation.

The films were interpreted by comparison with data published in the X-Ray Powder Data File issued by the American Society for Testing Materials, and by direct comparison with available standard patterns. The value of the unit-cell dimension of the cubic compound, which was the predominant constituent of the metallic object, was calculated.

- page 56 -

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing text describing the results of an X-ray diffraction analysis on a metallic sample from an unidentified aerial object.

The text in the document states:

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the metallic portion of the sample was interpreted as representing diffractions from the following compounds:

1) Predominant constituent: face-centered cubic compound with unit-cell dimension, a = 3.62A approximately; corresponds to a gamma-iron solid solution as found in austenitic steel (austenite), e.g. nickel-bearing and manganese-bearing types, and to meteoric iron (taenite).

2) trace constituents: quartz and calcite.

The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the small amounts of not-well-known material on the surface of the aerial object was essentially as follows:

- page 57 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with the results of an X-ray diffraction analysis. The text describes the analysis and conclusions regarding the composition of an "unidentified aerial object" that consisted of a "metallic face-centered cubic compound" with a unit-cell dimension agreeing with those of 1) austenitic steel, and 2) meteoric iron.

1) major constituent:
2) large constituents: "spinell-type compound", close
3) small minor constituents: goethite, u-Fe-O.OH
4) trace constituent: lepidocrocite, y-Fe-O.OH

The semi-quantitative spectrographic analysis results are provided, indicating the percentages by weight of the principal constituents. 

The conclusions state that the X-ray diffraction analysis indicated the unidentified aerial object consisted of a metallic face-centered cubic compound, with a unit-cell dimension agreeing with those of austenitic steel and meteoric iron. The semi-quantitative spectrographic analysis showed, however, that there was insufficient nickel present for the material to be of meteoric origin.

- page 58 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing only typed text.

OCR Output:
Damage observed in the micrographic analysis to indicate that the metallic material is best described as "high-manganese austenitic stainl. This is consistent with the very weak ferromagnetic nature of the metal.

The iron oxide and the hydrated iron oxides on the surface are normal results of the exposure of steel to the atmosphere. The amounts of quartz and calcite detected by X-ray diffraction are very small, and are common extraneous materials.

The analyses indicate that the object contains no minerals or materials not normally constituent with common high-tensile steels. The object is therefore considered to be of terrestrial origin.

SUBJ: UFO SIGHTING OF 16 JUNE 1968

Called Sulfur Grove and asked if they had launched a balloon on 16 June 1968 that would have been able to be seen from 6:45 pm to 7:20 pm. The weather officer said although the records had been destroyed it certainly could have been one of their balloons. Ordinarily they launch the balloons at 6:00 pm plus or minus ½ hr and that the balloon can sometimes be seen for as long as 1½ hrs. The balloon is on top under which is attached a hoop to stabilize the parachute. A cable hangs down from the balloon and at the end a small payload is attached.

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

A matter of a week or so ago, I recall reading in our news paper and hearing on the radio that the UFO is no longer being investigated and I can not buy it. 

There are space-ships and very real, as to where they come from, like the Air Force and Project Blue Book, I like-wise don't know, can tell you, they can not.

Believe me, I am not a nut or am I look1ng for fame. I'm only trying to make you people realize that UFO's are flying around!

As to what kind of beings they may be or as to what kind of power they use or cause is unknown to me, I can only say, they have my own ideas on that matter.

It is, in my mind, that is very possible for them to come from outer-space and this is a fact, then they could be from the USSR or the USA and I doubt the former, then they come from the latter. 

I would appreciate it very much that we get the truth once and for all on this matter.

1. We are returning the enclosed AF Form 117s on sightings of 1 June and 7 June 1963. The sightings have not been investigated in accordance with AFR 80-17 as the AF Form 117 is used only to gather statistical data and is not to be used by itself in reporting a UFO observation.

2. After the prescribed preliminary investigation you cannot identify the stimulus or have caused the sighting, you only may tentatively identify the stimulus or if the sighting is too old to investigate properly, the report is held for six months and then destroyed in accordance to AFM 127-5, 1 December 1952, paragraph 11.011.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"Here was a light around as broad as 6 inches wide which was very brilliantly illuminated, appeared to be incandescent light. This circle became larger, its dimensions constantly increasing, shooting out from its center over to the right - and then disappearing to the left. The light seemed to go off then come back on again very rapidly - now this bright light went to the left rapidly and then to the right. This was orange-white light.

Sketch of y light was at first just a small point of light, increasing in size to a full circular shape - then diminishing. - Beam of light was a violent white - lasted only 1/2 second. Looked like a spark hit water and then went out.

So unusual how this light world have been covered. It was just too close to cover anymore than that."

Output from the OCR:

My girlfriend and I were driving back from Dayton, Ohio on the night of August 5, 1968, at approximately 10:30 p.m. We were traveling north on Interstate 75 about ten miles south of Dayton when I noticed a strange object in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but as we drove closer, it became apparent that it was not a star, but a large, brightly lit object. The object appeared to be stationary and was hovering over the highway. As we got closer, the object started to move and it became clear that it was not an ordinary aircraft. 

It had a pearl-like glow and seemed to be about the size of a medium-sized plane. As it moved, it appeared to be spinning or rotating. The object then moved rapidly upwards and to the right, coming to a stop and remaining stationary for several minutes. It then moved downwards and to the left, all the while maintaining its pearl-like glow. We continued to watch the object for approximately 20 minutes before it suddenly disappeared. 

I was very excited by what I had seen and I hope that this report will be helpful and that you can identify what the object was. I would be happy to provide any additional information that may be required. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

At question #3 of the questionnaire you state: "change brightness" or "flicker or flicker" 

The sample was the shape similar to approximately 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, as to the changing of its brightness, if real, seemed to show by its irregular pulsating nature the flashing or fluctuating on and off, to disappear from around object in upward direction as opposed to any other direction. Light than very strong from object contrasted with only the bright phenomena observed. At night right of its disappearance it reappeared about 70 feet away and hovered motionless for about 10 minutes, then started to re-appear slowly.

Complaints About "A" UFO Procedure

To the Editor:
I would like to tell you about an incident that happened last Sunday evening at approximately 7 p.m. We were sitting on the front porch when we noticed what appeared to be a U.F.O. After observing that it did not seem to move my husband got the binoculars to see what it was. It was a flat object with three engine straight out behind it and one short one on the front that hung down. I called the police and they came, took one look and said The Dispatch and they gave me a number at L.A.F.B where I should report it. The lady I talked to was delightful. After I put the young man for almost a half hour I put my husband on the phone. He, too, got disgusted at the stupid questions that were asked of him. told the young man at L.A.F.B. he was reporting something to him, and that he was only trying to report something to him, and it is pretty sad to think that some Air Force in the minds of some people can't even ask a sensible question. If this is what they want to report an U.F.O, then I can understand why people are hesitant to get involved. That is the last time we will do it again.

June 12, 1968

Dear Dr. Hynek,

I called Ridge Ave. Monday night (June 10) to ask your permission to go out after the object described in the enclosed clipping "X". You said you'd come out of town so I did what you'd expect me to -- I went after it anyway.

After I talked to you, I called this object. She seemed intelligent and willing to discuss the sighting. Before long, she was giving me a description of an object which certainly did sound like "jelly/jam" and "falling leaf." There were eight observers with two pairs of binoculars.

Meanwhile, another person had called -- saying he had seen the same object in the same location the week before. He was driving at the time and decided to track it down. He came to the High School (11 miles away) and observed the object through high-powered binoculars. It was then that he noticed the "jelly/jam" and "kite-flyer." Seems there was an eccentric little fellow, about 50, who lives in a rented room high school grounds, running around like a Montey Python crummy). He built the kite and transports it to the school grounds via city bus (1). The boy's 12-20 inches high; several feet long; and has wide plastic streamers for tails -- the longest tail is 250 feet long. The enclosed drawing was made by this person. She said the dimensions given seem to fit with what they had noticed the previous Sunday. They had undoubtedly seen the same object.

Only thing left is to verify with the kite flyer that he was actually flying it on June 2 at 1900, but I don't know how to reach him. As far as I'm concerned, I consider the case closed.

Glad I solved this one so easily, but worry it wasn't a good juicy UFO which I personally observed from a distance of 10 feet. Better luck(?) next time.

I observed these balloons at 2210 hrs Monday June 10 -- (My G-D, I hope they were the balloons). In case you have any cases come up for comparison, my sighting follows:

I was standing in the yard at ________ looking directly south. The temperature was 72 - 75, humidity very high, very hazy, with a high misty overcast. Only objects visible were jupiter, very hazy, and the full moon, rising very low, and very dim.

I noticed a star-like object rising slowly out of the South, heading North. It was about 5-10 degrees above the horizon, magnitude, and a steady white light. Its motion was slow and continuous, about comparable to 1/10 the speed of an aircraft at 20-30 thousand feet.

When this object had risen to about 20 degrees above the horizon, it began a course change, continuing on a course roughly parallel to the horizon. Then it slowed, finally remaining stationary high in the E. Then it began a slow descent, finally disappearing with an apparent upward motion in the NW.

At intervals of about 5 minutes, three other objects followed, covering the same path across the sky; the only difference being the last three objects did not blink. All objects continually drifted back toward the South and faded.  

These objects definitely could have given the impression that they were under positive control.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES JUNE 10-16, 1968

The charts in this publication are continuations of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All the charts in this publication are arranged on a single page of this publication.

These are operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center of Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously. An explanatory sheet is available and may be obtained by writing to Environmental Services Administration, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

The 500-Millibar Weather Map presents the height contours of the 500-millibar surface. The isotherms are shown as continuous lines and are related to real shows surface in real level. The temperature values are shown as dashed lines and are related to the 500-millibar level. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredths of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are under lines. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.
