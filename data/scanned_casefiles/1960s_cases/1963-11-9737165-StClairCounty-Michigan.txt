1. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to a CONGRESSMAN HARVEY regarding a UFO sighting in Saint Clair County, Michigan, on 11 Nov 63.

2. It is believed that the object sighted by Deputy Baker was a helicopter. However, reports to identify a specific vehicle have proved inconclusive. Based on the description, this object was a rotary-wing aircraft.

3. During telephone conversation between Doctor J. Allen Hynek and Captain Baker, information received indicated that this was the most probable cause.

4. A helicopter was observed during the daylight hours on subsequent days by other persons in the area and their stories of the observation were consistent in local newspapers.

5. Efforts to identify these subsequent observations with a particular helicopter proved inconclusive.

3. Should Congressman Harvey desire further investigative efforts, additional expenditure of funds and manpower is not warranted in view of the long delay in reporting the incident and the lack of substantial evidence to justify an evaluation of this sighting as a helicopter observation.
