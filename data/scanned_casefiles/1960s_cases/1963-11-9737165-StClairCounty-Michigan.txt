SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (St Clair County, Michigan)

1. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply
to Congressman Harvey regarding a UFO sighting in Saint Clair County,
Michigan, on 12 Nov 63.

2. It is believed that the object sighted by Deputy Baker was a
helicopter. However, efforts to identify a specific vehicle have
proved negative. Reasons for belief that the object was a helicopter
are as follows:

a. During telephone conversation between Doctor J Allen Hynek
and Deputy Baker information received indicated that this was the
most probable cause.

b. A helicopter was observed during the day light hours on
subsequent days by other persons in the area and their stories of
the sighting were carried in local newspapers.

c. Efforts to identify these subsequent observations with a
particular helicopter also proved negative.

3. Should Congressman Harvey desire further investigative efforts
to identify known helicopter activity in the area, officials from
Selfridge AFB may be directed to conduct this investigation. However,
we feel that additional expenditure of funds and manpower is not
warranted in view of the long delay in time since the initial report.
Also, we feel that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to
justify an evaluation of this sighting as a helicopter observation.
