The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record, which is a government program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States. The text on the page provides details about a sighting that occurred on 31 August 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. The sighting involved a balloon (hot air, garnet bag) that was observed for 10 minutes. The description states that the object looked about the size of a Ford tail light, and when it turned south, it looked like a foot-tall light with the light in front and a little above it. The light was yellow, and object just broke up and sent sparks coming from it.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old report about daily weather maps, specifically the "Weekly Series Sept. 9-15, 1968" published by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Environmental Science Services Administration / Environmental Data Service.

The text on the page provides detailed descriptions and explanations of the information presented in the weather maps, including the meaning of various symbols, contour lines, and precipitation patterns.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE SERVICES ADMINISTRATION/ENVIRONMENTAL DATA SERVICE

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES SEPT. 9-15, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the weather maps previously published in the U.S. Weather Bureau publication "Daily Weather Maps". The publication presents a synoptic analysis of the 500 millibar surface and a surface weather map for each day from 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined frontal systems, the locations of these frontal systems, and the associated pressure areas are indicated by symbols at 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time as indicated by the small black squares encircling the symbols. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are plotted above the station models are only a fraction of those that are actually used in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasionally, apparent discrepancies between the plotted reports and the analyses result from these station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in units of geopotential Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The highest and lowest Temperature values Chart presents the maximum and minimum temperature values for the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting stations can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the minimum temperature.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS 

WEEKLY SERIES SEPT. 23-29, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the Altitude Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the 500-Millibar Chart. All of the charts for one day are presented on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbology used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those pre- viously used on the Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Public Documents Office, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also be ordered, at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents conditions at the surface of the earth as shown by dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level. The Highest and Lowest Temper- ature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m., e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Area and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are under- lined. "T" indicates a trace of precipi- tation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text in the document is as follows:

Dear Sir:
I would like to report a sighting of an UFO. I am a sophomore at Christian Brothers College in Memphis, Tennessee, majoring in Electrical Engineering. The following is what occurred:
"It was about 9:08 PM on Monday September 30, 1968, when I left our campus radio station. I had been talking to______, the Chief Engineer, about the distortion of the audio. I told him that I was going back to the room and listen in. I just got out in the open, when I looked up and spotted an object about the size of a dime held at arms length. I watched it for a few seconds, and then realized that there was no sound. Since both______ and I are UFO enthusiasts, I ran back down to the station and told him about it. He came back with me, and we watched it for about two minutes.
The object was a reddish color which seemed to fade once in a while. It was also constant, that is it did not flash. We also noticed that it had a sort of football shape. The object seemed to be at a fairly high altitude, but we were convinced that it was not an aircraft because it did not have the proper marking lights, and the course seemed to be erratic. We watched it till it seemed to turn to the east, and vanished. The entire incident lasted approximately two minutes and thirty seconds. This is not the first time we've seen one, but this is the first one I am reporting in writing. The others we reported to the Millington Naval Air Station, but this time they told me to write."

I met with Rev. --- on Wednesday evening, September 25, 1968 at his sighting and turned over a piece of material to me which he felt should be analyzed. This material was found at his sighting during the work of August 1968. I told him I would have it analyzed. This was not there the evening before. He does not know whether there is any connection between the sighting and finding this material but feels we might be interested in having it analyzed. He did show me the place to me which he said he could not identifyily the material.
As far as the sighting is concerned, the following are additional facts not covered in the attached narrative and report form:
Although it was clear when the witness sighted and when he got an inter-mittent line of lights crossing the sky at a great speed, there was a power line obscuring part of his view from the area where the lights were seen. There is a power line crossing his field of vision but the sighting was not in this direction. One thing was mentioned which Rev. --- verified this sighting and also there was no known aircraft or helicopters in the area at the time and it passed through an open window and could not hear any noise. It seemed to be at a high speed and lacked identifiable characteristics.
CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS:

UFO SIGHTING REPORT

In your own words, please describe the incident as is described. (If additional pages are needed, be sure they are numbered.)

The location of the farm is in Whitefield, Maine. I refer to as Kings Mills. I bought the farm three years ago and spend considerable time there and odd days when I can. Last summer...in late July or the first part of August...I found the farmhouse door I have had ever since then trying to get someone to identify it and I would not have seen it on to you but for what happened last Monday morning. Whether the two things are related or not, I do not know, but they might possibly be. I am not saying they are not. Perhaps the substance of some common material, but no one knows how it got there...we know that it was not there the night before and some put it there as far as we know.

- page 87 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text only.

Transcribed text from the document:

"- 1 - (continued)
why feet from the bed to the floor and again noticed the soft ray, or light
just coming up above the bed. Suddenly objects which I had already
passed them off as moon-beams. Then I went into the lavatory and saw an
object which looked like an explosion. I was not entirely awake then,
that something was wrong and that it could not be the moon because the
moon just did not rise in that part of the sky (too far North anyway) and
secondly I noted that the heavy overhead light had set in during the night and there
were no stars visible anywhere. At the time I began to realize something
was wrong. I tried to move my head to see the object through another direction
but could not as if I had been in a glass case. Nothing changed at all and as I realized with a start what
was going on (NOT the moon) it just went out or vanished just like
was as if someone had pulled the plug. There was no after-image. It just
went out. There was no sound. I had bathroom window open. The
bathroom window was closed. There was no sound and nothing out of the
ordinary there, I could speak about - Afterwards, it was the same as before.
Now the size of the object, at the closest possible point, depending upon
the distance of course, I would estimate to be from 6 feet at the
closest possible point. Roughly 30 feet at the furthest point. The shape of the
object I am vague on. Perhaps longer that it was wide...more like two deep
saucers or vegetable dishes placed together, a domed construction
on edge with a side toward you. The color was orange-red or yellow-orange.
Could not make a focus on it. It continued without the dazed in
bedroom. Looking back, there appeared to be two separate light beams -
something like two separate flashing beams but these beams were not
round but oval,shaped more like a pencil. I would say that they were
seven or eight inches long and an inch or so across. It is odd that they
should be separated since the window was open and there was nothing to
break the beam unless, of course, there were two separate beams. The
light reflections were horizontal and the beams were about four or five
inches apart. The bottom half of the window was completely open and shades
was pulled down to the open spot. There were no window panes, sashes,
curtains of anything to interfere with the light(s).
Monday morning I looked around and of course could find absolutely nothing.
I went over everything a dozen times so that I knew what I could say I saw
and what I didn't know. Up to say I did not find anything that I could
positively identify as anything other than an illusion caused by what I was
to term of my experience. You gave me the name of a party in Wenham, Mass.
(Raymond Fowler) but I have utterly NEGAP MANS' SUGGESTION.
I have always believed in extra-terrestrial objects in our atmosphere. I
have subscribed to your paper since it was early printed and I have bought
everything I could get on the matter. I used to look for a little more
many to you than I have been.
At it was handwritten now. I have not had a 38' reflection ours, you see,
in the summer when the weather is right. strictly an amateur. I never
misidentified anything in the sky."

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

have seen anything like this. Once, driving through the White Mountains with my wife about ten years ago, we were both startled by what appeared to be an airliner swoosh across our path dead ahead of us. All we could make out was the fact that there were numerous round, single-pane windows along the side of the object, like an airliner. It was at night. There was no noise and no light other than our headlights and the lights inside the object. We remember the event. We seldom speak of it but now it comes back to us and we know no airliner could be that close to the ground and be absolutely silent. So, now I am going to the farm, I probably will sit up all night waiting for another show.

This image contains several illustrations related to a UFO report document. The first illustration is a compass-like diagram with directional labels, likely used to indicate the direction of the observed phenomenon. The second and third illustrations depict sketches of observed UFO sightings, showing a person standing in the foreground and a landscape in the background.

The text in the document appears to be instructions or guidelines for describing and documenting UFO sightings, including directions on how to use the compass-like diagram and the sketches.

The text in the document reads:

ON NOW NOTHING YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "B". THAT IS, APPROXIMATELY SHOW WHERE THE PHENOMENON WAS SITUATED AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY. ATTEMPT TO BE ACCURATE, GUIDED AS AN EXAMPLE BY THE SKETCH AS AN EXPLANATION OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

SURFACE AND UPPER-AIR TEMPERATURES 
SEPTEMBER 9, 1968 
WEST GULF, MEMPHIS, TN
GENERAL SUMMARY

A low pressure system centered over Missouri is producing cloudy, rainy weather over the central and eastern states. A weak high pressure system is building over the extreme northeastern states.

Surface temperatures are in the 50s and 60s over the northern states and 70s and 80s over the southern states. Upper air temperatures are in the 40s at 850 mb and 30s at 700 mb over the northern states and 50s at 850 mb and 40s at 700 mb over the southern states.

Surface and upper air analyses indicate the low pressure system over Missouri will weaken tonight as it moves eastward. Drier and cooler air will move into the eastern states tomorrow as the high pressure system builds. Skies should clear and temperatures moderate across the eastern half of the country on Tuesday.
