DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES SEPT. 9-15, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are coded from data prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in the Daily Weather Map.

An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Public Inquiries Division, Washington, D.C. 20235. Bulk copies may also be ordered at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m., E.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by chains of arrows; the locations of these centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasionally there are apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses that result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms at the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. E.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in heavy lines. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m./e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals, a number of "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasionally apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses may result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the 500-millibar contours and isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./c.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m./c.s.t. The names of the reporting points are obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are under lined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE TWO HEADLIGHTS WITH A SMALL RED LIGHT LOCATED BETWEEN THEM. THE OBJECT WAS SELF-LUMINOUS AND VERY BRIGHT. IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PENNY HELD AT ARMS LENGTH. THE SHAPE WAS NOT REALLY DISCERNABLE BUT THE LIGHTS WERE ON THE HORIZONTAL PLANE, GIVING AN ELONGATED ILLUSION. IT COULD NOT BE COMPARED TO ANYTHING IN THE SKY. IT COULD BE COMPARED TO A CAR WITH A RED RUNNING LIGHT FROM ABOUT TWO BLOCKS AWAY.

58104 Box 644
September 30, 1968

Dear Sir;

I would like to report a sighting of an UFO. I am a sophomore at Christian Brothers College in Memphis, Tennessee, majoring in Electrical Engineering. The following is what occured:

"It was about 9:08 PM on Monday September 30, 1968, when I left our campus radio station. I had been talking to the Chief Engineer, about the distortion of the audio. I told him that I was going back to the room and listen in. I just got out in the open, when I looked up and spotted an object about the size of a dime held at arms length. I watched it for a few seconds, and then realized that there was no sound. Since both and I are UFO enthusiasts, I ran back down to the station and told him about it. He came back with me, and we watched it for about two minutes.

The object was a reddish color which seemed to fade once in a while. It was also constant, that is it did not flash. We also noticed that it had a sort of football shape. The object seemed to be at a fairly high altitude, but we were convinced that it was not an aircraft because it did not have the proper marking lights, and the course seemed to be irradict. We watched it till it seemed to turn to the east, and vanished. The entire incident lasted approximately two minutes and thirty seconds. This is not the first time we've seen one, but this is the first one I am reporting in writing. The others we reported to the Milington Naval Air Station, but this time they told me to write."

NICAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING: 23 September 1968/Whitefield, Maine/2:30 AM EDT
DATE: 9 October 1968
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman
TO: NICAP, Washington, D.C.                CC: PTD (TDSR) USAF

BACKGROUND:
I received a telephone call from Rev who had phoned NICAP in Washington and had been referred to me. The date of his phone call to me was September 24th. I assigned Herbert Eismann to the case and his report of the interview is as follows:

INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT: (Herbert Eismann)
I met with Rev on Wednesday evening, September 25, 1968 at which time he gave me a complete narrative of his sighting and turned over a piece of material to me which he felt should be analyzed. This material was found at his farm during the first week of August 1968. He claims that the material was there in the morning but was definitely not there the evening before. He does not know whether there is any connection between the sighting and finding the material but felt we might be interested in having it analyzed. He did show the piece to a Geology Professor in Maine who said he could not identify the material. (Did not lab-check it.)

As far as the sighting is concerned, the following are additional facts not covered in the attached narrative and report form.

The object appeared as if it were darker in the center and although an outline/shape could be seen it was also diffused. There is a power line about a quarter of a mile from the farm to the West but the sighting was not in this direction. One thing was mentioned which Rev. Kittredge thought was most unusual and that was he could not hear a river at all during the sighting. It is usually quite loud but he actually listened for it through an open window and could not hear it. He seemed to be a sincere and responsible individual seeking no publicity.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS:
Although it was clear when the witness retired and when he got up later in the morning after the sighting - during the sighting it was overcast. It was a strange, as actual weather observations at Port land were that of clear weather, no clouds. Local mist or perhaps something related to the UFO could explain this discrepancy. Lack of noises from river interesting. "enclosing material" mentioned. He found two pieces about 1" by 2" long. It looks like foam plastic and probably has no connection with UFOs.

UFO SIGHTING REPORT

1. PERSONAL ACCOUNT

The location of the farm is in Whitefield, Maine...in an area the natives refer to as Kings Mills. I bought the farm three years ago and spend vacations there and odd days when I can slip away for a little while.

Last summer...in late July or the first part of August...I found the enclosed material on the lawn not far from the back door. I have had it ever since then trying to get someone to identify it and I would not have sent it on to you but for what happened last Monday morning. Whether the two things are related or not, I do not know, but they might possibly be. I am not saying they are or that they are not. Perhaps the substance is some common material, but no one knows how it got there...we know that it is was not there the night before and no one put it there as far as we know.

At this time of year, there is comparatively little traffic on Route #218. The area is country and there is no industry anywhere around. The neighbor's house is used occasionally and at the time I am speaking about, the house was empty. September 22, Sunday afternoon, there was a hard but very short shower during the afternoon...not an electrical storm.

The evening was beautifully clear and warm. The stars were beautiful. I went to bed about 9:30 PM. At about 2:30 AM (I did not turn any time I had on any lights or use a flashlight...I am estimating the time from a downstairs Westminster chime clock) I awoke somewhat and in turning over in bed I noticed what appeared to be two rays of soft yellow-orange light on the dresser about the same height as the floor or the floor on the window. At the time I thought how nice it was to have the moon coming up.

As I closed my eyes and thought about getting back to sleep, I decided to step into the lavatory first. I swung

my feet from the bed to the floor and again noticed the soft rays of light but did not pay too much attention to them this time as I had already passed them off as moon-beams. Then I went into the lavatory and saw an orange-colored object which I thought to be moon. I was not entirely awake, then, while still in the lavatory, a few seconds later, I realized that something was wrong and that it could not be the moon because the moon just did not rise in that part of the sky (too far North anyway) and afterward I noted that heavy overcast had set in during the night and there were no stars visible anywhere. At the time I began to realize something was wrong, I tried to move my head to see the object through another window pane, assuming that I had a distorted vision because of imperfect window glass. Nothing changed at all and as I realized with a scare what I was seeing (NOT the moon), it just went out or vanished just like that. It was as if someone had pulled the plug. There was no after-image. It just went out. There was no sound. I had both bedroom windows open. The bathroom window was closed. There was no sound and nothing out of the ordinary that I could speak about. Afterwards, it was the same as before.

Now the size of the object, at the closest possible point, depending upon the distance of course, I would estimate to be from 6 feet... at the closest possible point. 30 feet at the farthest point. The shape of the object I am vague on.. perhaps longer that it was wide... more like two deep saucers or vegetable dishes placed with concave sections together, standing on edge with a side toward you. The color was orange-red or yellow-orange.

I would like to make a few remarks about the light on the dresser in the bedroom. Looking back, there appeared to be two separate light beams - something like two separate flashlight beams but these beams were not round but oval, shaped more like a pencil. I would say that they were seven or eight inches long and an inch or so across. It is odd that they should be separated since the window was open and there was nothing to break the beam unless, of course, there were two separate beams. The light reflections were horizontal and the beams were about four or five inches apart. The bottom half of the window was completely open and shade was pulled down to the open spot. There were no window panes, sashes, outside trees or anything to interfere with the light(s).

Monday morning I looked around and of course could find absolutely nothing. I went over everything a dozen times so that I knew what I could say I saw and what I would have to say I did not see. I returned to Salisbury, Mass. Monday evening. Tuesday morning I called NICAP, Washington to find out who to tell of my experience. You gave me the name of a party in Wenham, Mass. (Raymond Fowler, Chairman, NICAP MASS SUBCOM).

I have always believed in extra-terrestrial objects in our atmosphere. I have subscribed to your paper since it was early printed and have bought everything; I could get on the matter. I used to kick in a little more money to you than I have been. The attached I have been trying to send all I can handle now. I have a 3" refractor scope I get out with sometimes in the summer when the weather is right. Strictly an amateur. I never

have seen anything like this. Once, driving through the White Mountains with my wife about ten years ago, we were both startled by what appeared to be an airliner swoosh across our path dead ahead of us. All we could make out was the fact that there were numerous round, single-pane windows along the side of the object like an airliner. It was at night. There was no noise and no light other than our headlights and the lights inside the object. We remember the event. We seldom speak of it but now it comes back to us and we know no airliner could be that close to the ground and be that big and be absolutely silent in flight. So, now I shall always wonder about this last objects. Next time I go to the farm I probably will sit up all night waiting for another show.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES SEPT. 30-OCT. 6, 1968

The charts in this publication are a
continuation of the principal charts
of the Weather Bureau publication,
Daily Weather Map. They include the
Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar
Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are
arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the
National Meteorological Center. Mr. chart
Bureau. The symbols used on the
Surface Weather Map and the 500Millibar Chart are the same as those
used previously in Daily Weather Map.
An explanatory sheet is available, and
single copies may be obtained without
charge by writing to: Environmental
Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AD 143, Rockville,
Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also
be ordered, at a cost of $2.50 per 50
copies. Check should be made payable
to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents
station data and the analysis for 7:00
a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined
low pressure areas are indicated by
chains of arrows; the locations of these
centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours
preceding map time are indicated by
small black squares enclosing white
crosses. Areas of precipitation are
indicated by shading. The weather
reports that are printed here are only
a fraction of those that are included in
the operational weather maps, and on
which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between
the printed station data and the analyses
result from those station reports that
cannot be included in the published
maps because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the
height contours and isotherms of the
500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. r.s.t.
The height contours are shown as contiguous lines, and are labeled in feet
above sea level. The isotherms are
shown as dashed lines, and are labeled
in degrees Celsius. The arrows show
the wind direction and speed at the
500-millibar level.

Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum
and minimum values for the 24 hour
period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The
names of the reporting points can be
obtained from the Surface Weather
Map. The maximum temperature is
plotted above the station location, and
the minimum temperature is plotted
below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts
Chart indicates by means of shading
the areas that had precipitation during
the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m.
Amounts in inches to the nearest
hundredth of an inch are for the same
period. Incomplete totals are indicated. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth
of snow on the ground in inches at
7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES SEPT 2-8, 1968

The charts in this publication are a
continuation of the principal charts
of the Weather Bureau publication,
Daily Weather Map. They include the
Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar
Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation
Chart. All of the charts for one day are
arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the
National Meteorological Center, Weather
Bureau. The symbols used on the
Surface Weather Map and the 500Millibar Chart are the same as those
used previously in Daily Weather Map.
An explanatory sheet is available, and
single copies may be obtained without
charge by writing to: Environmental
Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AD 143, Rockville,
Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also
be ordered at a cost of $2.50 per 50
copies. Orders should be made payable
to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents
station data and the analysis for 7:00
a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined
low pressure areas are indicated by
chains of arrows; the locations of these
centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours
preceding map time are indicated by
small black squares enclosing white
crosses. Areas of precipitation are
indicated by shading. The weather
reports that are printed here are only
a fraction of those that are included in
the operational weather maps, and on
which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between
the printed station data and the analyses
result from those station reports that
cannot be included in the published
maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the
height contours and isotherms of the
500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t.
The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet
above sea level. The isotherms are
shown as dashed lines, and are labeled
in degrees Celsius. The arrows show
the wind direction and speed at the
500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum
and minimum values for the 24-hour
period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The
names of the reporting points can be
obtained from the Surface Weather
Map. The maximum temperature is
plotted above the station location, and
the minimum temperature is plotted
below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts
Chart indicates by means of shading
the areas that had precipitation during
the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m.
Amounts in inches to the nearest
hundredth of an inch are for the same
period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth
of snow on the ground in inches as of
7:00 a.m. of the previous day.
