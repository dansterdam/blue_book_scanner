GODCOP
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO)

TO: AFSC (PTD)

1. Reference AFIR 200-2, as amended. The following described unidentified flying objects are an addition to our report of 6 August 1965:

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS: The reported objects are plotted on the attached maps with descriptions as referenced in subparagraph 2. below.

2. Reported by 2d Missile Division, Eglin AFB, Florida. First sighting occurred at approximately 1430 hours on 29 August 1965. The objects were described as bright spheres and the second sighting occurred at approximately 1640 hours the same day with the observation of two objects approximately one mile apart, moving at a high rate of speed at an angle of about 30 degrees.

3. Reported from Radar Section, Cape Kennedy AFS, Florida, and observed by nine military personnel. See plot number 2.

(1) The first sighting was of an object the size of a star which appeared to be traveling at a high speed, disappearing in about 10 to 15 seconds. Very fast, and disappeared.

(2) The second sighting was of two objects near the north of the observation station. One object had a brightness approximately equal to the station's navigation beacon, while the other was dimmer and seemed to be a little slower in speed. Both objects changed direction in a zigzag manner, at times appearing to stop, then continuing on. The last object was visible for about 10 minutes.

Objects reported by ATIC to the Geophysical Survey Team, who observed them with the aid of a telesonic (equivalent to a 40 power telescope).

(1) Object appeared to be elliptical in shape, appeared the size of a pinhead, and maneuvered in a complex and erratic manner. See plot number 1.

In the middle of the field of view, a diffuse or hazy object was observed. This object was larger and had less definite form, and was indistinct as shown on plot.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

(2) Object sighted appeared in same location but on the next occasion it appeared to be a brilliant source and disappeared to the east. At first, the object became three white objects, but as it moved away the three objects were now six red.
d. Object sighted and observed through binoculars by staff section and on radar. Object moved about 4 miles in 30 seconds, about the size of a saucer, moved with a swirling up and down motion, white in color with occasional flashes of light.
Object was also observed on 31 August and 3 September. See plot number 4.
a. Object first spotted by personnel of the 551st USAF Medical Group of eight young civilians, whose hobby is scanning with a 50/100 telescope.
b. Object appeared low on the horizon, moving slowly. Its color was a combination of white, yellow, and red lights, sometimes four lights, sometimes close together with red, white, and blue lights. See plot number 42.
c. Object first sighted by personnel of the Air Force, who informed two Air Force Intelligence officers. The latter observed the object through binoculars. It was about the size of a 30/l00 telescope, and appeared to perform various maneuvers as if under intelligent control. The object's motion deferred from movements characteristic of meteors or other celestial objects.
3. The purpose of the object has not been determined. No evidence to substantiate its existence as a celestial body has been obtained. It presents a problem in astronomy and can present a hazard.
4. The weather in all instances was clear with occasional clouds.
5. Report was compiled by Lt. Col. Paul Totten, Intelligence Staff Officer, Offutt Air Force Base.
6. Accurate data concerning the locations of observers and directions of flight are included for assessment.
7. Analyze information as to whether this or the previous report may be a valid report of an unidentified flying object.
