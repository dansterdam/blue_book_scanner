Unappraised at its traveled way from observers due to limited visibility. Total duration 20 minutes. UX was smo, 1 mile visibility, low ceiling, strong winds from the NW. Observed by 5 high school students with sled, nearest approach 3/4 mile to observers. Close to water but not in contact with known water. Object shows St James River.

(3) Ceiling: 1400 feet overcast with intermittent 100 feet obscured.

(4) Visibility: 2 miles with intermittent 1½ miles.

(5) Amount of cloud cover: Overcast.

(6) Thunderstorms: None.

(7) Vertical temperature gradient:
Surface         3.5C
3000 ft         8.2C
4880 ft         4.5C
9000 ft         7.5C
9880 ft         8.5C
18,280 ft       23.0C
20,600 ft       27.1C

h. There was no other unusual activity or condition which might account for the sighting.

i. There was no interception of the object.

j. Due to the low ceilings and limited visibility it is extremely doubtful that air traffic or balloon releases might account for the sighting.

k. This report was prepared by Captain William L. Bishop, USAF, 4500 AB Wing (DOO-S), Langley AFB, Virginia. The description of the sighting was given by Mr. ______ during a personal interview on 2 February 1965. This object was observed by five high school students. The two students interviewed stated that the object was in very close proximity to the water but appeared not to be in contact with the water. The object was also estimated to be about 3/4-mile away at its closest point. The interviewed stated that the lights observed were not of the type normally associated with boats and that no fog horn was heard. The draw-bridge operator stationed on the James River bridge and located down-river from the sighting stated that a small craft was headed down-river approximately ½-hour prior to the sighting but that there were no vessels headed upstream at the time of the sighting. The possibility still exists that the object was a boat due to the relative slow movement and the fact that many boats operate on the James River. There is also the possibility that the many lights in the Hampton Roads area could produce optical illusions when viewed through the blowing snow.

1. There is no existence of physical evidence.
