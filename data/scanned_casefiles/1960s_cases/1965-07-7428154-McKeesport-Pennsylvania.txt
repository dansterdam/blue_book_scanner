or that sparkled white, like something that was turning around. She was
inconsistent in that she said at first they thought it might be something
very high catching the light or the sun one hour before dawn, and on the
other hand, she said that the objects were below the overcast, when told
that there was an overcast. Mr.[redacted] also watched the north-going light
with an opera glass but could see no more than he saw at first.

Both she and her husband like to fish at night and are familiar
with the way stars look and the manner in which planes go across the sky.
They stated the usual thing we get in these reports. "They never saw any-
thing like it,} but they would like the Air Force to tell them what it was
they saw.

When she awakened her husband she said, [redacted] get up and watch
these lights." Never saw any shape, only a light, no sound, and I
questioned her closely on noise in the neighborhood. At that hour she
says there are no noises because they live in a residential section. Both
objects never varied in speed and always went at the same speed.

This remains an unknown unless we can show that at that precise
time one of the satellites was going on a south to north passage. If so,
we might conclude one light was a satellite, the other a plane, and the
rendezvous purely an illusion. We need further information on the actual
cloud cover and on the satellite schedule. Balloons are ruled out, and I
rather think helicopters are, but not necessarily. If helicopters, then
their actions were rather strange. No green or red lights were ever noticed,
only one light apiece, and a very white light, slowly pulsating. The
trajectory was always a straight line, there being no weaving or intermittent
motion except the time when they apparently stopped. I think sending a
16h would now do very little good since I think I have squeezed out all
the information she, at least, has. Now that I think of it, I quite
forgot to ask if she herself had seen any stars, although the original
report said that some stars were visible. The moon was at first quarter
and so had set long before. Suggest we get the weather records, and I
can further drop her a note and ask her specifically if she saw stars.

Enclosure

The following is a summary of the events observed 0400 to 0410, 6 July 1965:

Upon being awakened by my wife and asked to observe something in the sky, I saw a pair of what appeared to be stars of approximately the first magnitude, or about the brightness of the belt stars of Orion. Their distance apart appeared to be about one half the distance of the adjacent stars in the Orion belt. After about one minute, the northernmost light began to move in a northerly direction, and when no longer observable from the southern window of our bedroom, we both hastily dressed and went outside and easily picked up the moving light. The observation of the moving light with a pair of 6 x 15 binoculars was easy, but there was no apparent enlargement of the object. The movement was now and had been from the time it was first noticed on a steady northern course, almost, if not due north.

The only apparent change seemed to occur when the Bessamer Converter at National Works, USS, began to 'blow' a heat and the sky became illuminated in the north above the mill. The light appeared to stop at this event. The mill is about a mile north of our home and in the valley, we being on a hill but not in direct sight of the mill. Very shortly the light was lost from sight.

The following observations were also noted:

The night was very calm, while standing under a tree to block interference from a brilliant street light on our corner, it was noticed that the branches were very still and without movement. Secondly, there was no moon visible. It was quiet. No sound of either piston type or jet type engines were heard. The impression was that the objects were of extreme height and traveling at a good speed for the altitude. If the objects were in orbit, it would have been a rather rapid speed. My attention was on this northerly light. My wife told me she observed the other one to move toward the south.

The position of the two lights at the beginning of the observation was to the east by approximately 20 degrees and to the south by about 30 degrees from the vertical. The northern light began and followed a course of about 360 degrees and was under observation through an arc of about 110 degrees before the mill light, smoke and/or clouds obscured our view. It would have been almost impossible to have viewed it to or from the northern or southern horizon. The entire episode took place under 10 minutes, for we had returned to bed when the last observation of time was made. The correctness of the clock would be plus or minus 10 minutes and was in Eastern Daylight Time.

UFO Case: Report of telephone conversation with Mrs. [redacted] McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

Unfortunately, the call took better than a half an hour, but I couldn't shake her story, although getting information from her was sometimes like pulling teeth. The general picture was this:

She and her husband were asleep as prior to 4:00 AM, 6 July, 1965. Bed faces a large window with no blinds, southern exposure. Horizon defined by neighbor's rooftop, but still giving good view of sky. Mrs. [redacted] awakened for one reason or another and saw a light like Echo coming directly up for the south over the neighbor's rooftop. The light was white, but slowly pulsating. It never blinked off completely. It was followed at some distance, by an identical light.

As to intensity and color and speed, the first light stopped at about an altitude of 45° while the other came up with it, and according to Mrs. [redacted] almost became like one. It was at this time that she decided to wake her husband who is, she says, a light sleeper. Her husband did not see the lights come together, but did see them separate. The duration of the rendezvous was, after much questioning, probably less than a minute.

One of the lights returned to the south over essentially the same path it had come, while the other took off (or continued), because the whole stopping-still may well have been an illusion) to the north. At this point, they both ran downstairs to the porch facing north and watched the object pass 10° east of the zenith and slowly proceed northward, finally becoming lost in the glare of the Bessemer converter lights which went on then, illuminating the sky and showing clouds. Mrs. [redacted] was not conscious of any real cloud cover and seemed surprised when I told her that the weather bureau had reported 9/10ths overcast. However, the original Air Force report is continuing on that; at one point, it slightly overcast, some stars visible, and shortly thereafter, it says overcast 19/10. Could mean 1/10th.

There were practically no surface winds, and winds weren't at a fair clip, but were from the west northwest, which rules out balloons. Mrs. [redacted] held to her story that the lights never disappeared, that is, never passed behind a cloud, which would indicate that the objects could not have been satellites (even if we appealed to complex conditions) and yet, if the lights were that low, absence of sound seems strange.

Objects like stars or the first magnitude resemble Echo. The woman's first impressions were this was a satellite or air plane, but she became startled when it stood still waiting for the other to catch up, with one then going south and the other going north.

Mrs. [redacted] herself was quite articulate, not excitable, and quite consistent in her story. The original report states that Mrs. [redacted] is a retired army army major with an excellent reliability record. I did not, however, talk with him. There are a few additional sidelights gathered during the conversation. She was impressed that the lights went clear across the sky, that is the one that went to the north. When asked why these couldn't have been helicopters, she said she never saw helicopters that went that high.

Mrs. [redacted]
McKeesport, Pennsylvania

Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

Unfortunately, I forgot to ask you one very important question the other evening when I called. When you first saw the object coming up from the south, did you see in its waking way, so to speak, among the stars? Were you conscious of there being many stars out? And, later on the porch facing north as you watched one of the objects go north, was it a starry night? Was the moon visible? Would you please also ask your husband whether he was conscious of the stars being out and roughly how many?

Thank you for your trouble.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek

Dear Dr. Hynek:

I am sorry I could not answer your letter sooner, but have been hospitalized and am just now getting after correspondence.

In answer to your query, I remember remarking that there were only three noticeable stars in the sky, and they were directly above us. The moon was not visible at any time during the interval.

To correct an answer I gave you on the phone, I believe I told you I thought it was a 'blinking' light rather than a 'twinkling' one. After consulting with my husband we decided it was more like a 'twinkling star'.

I am enclosing a summary written by my husband which may clear up any information left hazy by my original explanation.

Sincerely yours,

Enc.
