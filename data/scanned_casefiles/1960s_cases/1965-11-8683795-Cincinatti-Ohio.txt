(minus ref. latter)

Enclosed is UFO Report No. 3 originating above the New England Power Plant, Salem, Massachusetts during 1965. This report recently came to light during a lecture I gave in Salem. Report No. 1 involved the daylight sighting of a minister's wife-shaped UFO on May 22, 1965 by a minister's wife, Mrs. Nellie B. Robinson and Report No. 2 involved the night sighting of a cigar-shaped UFO on October 26, 1965 by James Centorino.

This location was also the site of the well-known U.S. Coast Guard UFO sighting and subsequent photo which took place on July 16, 1952. I hope soon to take steps to alert people in this area to report UFO activity to one concerned immediately. Others are a number of residences near the power station.

Of particular interest is the enclosed letter from an apparent eye-witness of the July 16, 1952 UFO sighting who is a service representative of the West Byfleet Electrical Corporation. He was supervising the erection of a new turbine generator in the yard of the power plant when the bright objects appeared and several overheard. Additional details may be forthcoming. I am sorry that his letter is such a long time coming. It got waylaid among the many pieces of paper-work in my study.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler

Jan-Feb 66

Jarrow deltavoluants?
From The Journal of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, November 8 edition, we learn how: "Mysterious flying objects have been seen shooting across the sky over Jarrow. A schoolboy and his parents said that night they had spotted several of them circling low over the town.

"They made a roaring noise and looked like silver triangles," said 13-year-old Joseph Hyde, of Albert Road. "We were not aeroplanes, because some of my friends telephoned Newcastle airport and were told that no civil aircraft were in the area at the time."

"Some time ago several residents of Inverness Road, Jarrow, reported seeing a strange object like a fireball in the sky. The object, which they christened 'The Thing', was on eight occasions. Mothers complained at the time that some of their children had been severely frightened by it.

"Mrs. Maureen Hyde, Joseph's mother said: "We didn't believe him when he came rushing into the house shouting he had seen something like a flying saucer. We went out to have a look and were amazed to see these silver things darting about the sky.

"My husband, who used to be in the Fleet Air Arm, was convinced they were not aeroplanes."

Sandown sighting
The Isle of Wight Chronicle of November 3 printed the following account: "An addition to the reports of strange, unidentified objects seen in the sky from the Sandown area comes from Mr. G. H. Cooper, proprietor of the electrical specialists business in St. John's Road, Sandown.

"While he and his wife were walking along the cliff from the direction of Shanklin at 6:25 p.m. last Wednesday, they saw an object, which had a white centre surrounded by a glowing blue ring, very high in the sky over Lake. Making no attempt to note other dropped clouds hovered a white then turned cockscrew at a terrific pace upwards and disappeared into the clouds.

"Mr. Cooper said the blue ring was of a phosphorus nature and unlike any colour he had seen. He was firmly of the opinion that the object could not have been a firework or anything normal."

        The following reader's letter appeared in The Evening Post of Jersey
        (the only newspaper published in the Channel Islands) of November 5:
        "Dear Sir,â€”Although I am a visitor to the Island, I would like to bring
        your readers' attention to the mysterious phenomenon that I observed
        heading due west at a high speed over the town. This was at about
        9:20 p.m. on Thursday evening [Nov. 12], and it appeared as an oval
        light of a definite shape. This was going at a high speed, but was
        quite low so that it could clearly be seen. It was in view for a few
        seconds and vanished in a few seconds, but I was able to get a good glimpse. It made
        no noise, so I could not have been as near as I thought. Neither could it have
        been a star, as the sky was cloudy. I would like to enquire whether anybody
        else has observed this phenomenon, or whether it has been seen before."

        last night in the sky at Humberstone, Mr. Geoffrey Ponfield, 10 The Drive,
        Scraptoft, saw the object between 10.15 and 10.30 p.m.

        "I was visiting a customer in Humberstone Boulevard and while
        waiting on the doorstep happened to look up at the sky. My auditor was
        with me and we both saw, moving quite slowly across the sky, a large
        cylindrical object showing a faint luminosity.

        "It was definitely not a firework, nor did it seem to be a meteor or a
        comet. It's hard to be objective in these circumstances. I can only say
        that I saw it and my companion saw it."

        things still exist.'"

New York

The Great American and Mexican Blackouts
By Gordon Creighton

AT approximately 5.18 p.m. on November 9, an area of 80,000 square miles, extending from Boston to Buffalo and up into the Canadian Province of Ontario, and embracing some 30,000,000 people, experienced a remarkable blackout, which in some areas lasted for as much as 134 hours (upper New York State) and in the other areas from three to six hours. All our readers will have seen full details in their papers, and I will quote here only a few lines from the six-page account that appeared in TIME Magazine for November 19:

"The first hint that the Northeast's huge CAUSE (Canadian-U.S. Eastern Interconnection) power-grid was in trouble came at 5.16. Moving blackouts, millions of kilowatts of electricity were coursing through the vast network of cables to meet the early-evening needs of the Western Hemisphere's most heavily-populated, most power-dependent region. In the summary central control room of the Ontario Hydro-Electric Commission, tele-pens tracing the flow of power suddenly shuddered. At the Rochester Gas and Electric Control, on the other side of Lake Ontario, the dials on a chart went blank. A minute later, meters at the mammoth Robert Moses Niagara Power Plantâ€”biggest in the Hemisphereâ€”began to show a drop from 1,500 megawatts to 2,250, then sank abruptly to zero.

"Giant generators spun uncontrollably out of step, and overload switches sprang open. At Consolidated Edison's Energy Control Center on West Side, Manhattan, the meters recorded 300,000 kilowatts. At 5.18 the flux reversed, and within seconds 1.5 million kw. were swirling northward..."

While admitting that not one utility expert could offer an explanation (the London Evening Standard had carried a report to the same effect from New York on November 11), TIME concluded that the blackout had been caused by the phenomenon known as "cascading". "When there is a sudden drain on the line, power rushes in to make up for the loss, but there is a tendency in such cases for the waves to pile up on each other in wild, ever-growing oscillations that carom through the circuit."

In Britain officialdom promptly assured us that "it couldn't happen here", and so said officialdom in most other parts of the U.S., such, for example, as officials of the power company at El Paso, Texas.

This being so, let us now note with growing interest that, on the night of December 3, another big blackout occurred, allegedly having its origin in that area. It lasted for two hours, and affected a total of about a million people in parts of western Texas, parts of New Mexico, and also the Mexican frontier town of Juarez. Four or five U.S. Air Force bases in the area were affected, one of them being Holloman Air Force Base, which is located near a missile centre and is well known to all students of the UFO problem by reason of the large number of sightings there.

I have a minimal knowledge of electrical matters, and certainly do not claim to know what caused these two blackouts, but it may be wise to assemble here a few scraps and notes which could conceivably help us to arrive at the right answer.

"Some New Yorkers claimed that they had seen a satellite pass over at the moment the lights failed," and argued that "the Russians had done it again."

2. The Italian paper Corriere della Sera of Syracuse, November 14: "A pilot from Syracuse (State of New York) has declared that he saw an enormous 'ball of fire' rise from the electric power line linking the town of Clay to Niagara Falls immediately after the sudden stoppage of current last week which plunged vast areas of the USA and Canada into darkness."

High-line patrol went over the line, foot by foot; every piece of apparatus concerned was tested and re-tested, but found in perfect order. The power company were unusually honest and frank and said: "The only logical assumption is that some kind of foreign substance came across the line and grounded it somehow." The pilot's declaration as to what it was, nor the faintest idea why the power went off, nor why it came on again."

(Letter from a U.S. correspondent to Harold T. Wilkins, quoted on pages 271/272 of his Flying Saucers on the Moveâ€”Title of U.S. edition: Flying Saucers Attack.)

6. To conclude, I refer readers to the vitally


- page 7 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

"The pilot, Weldon Ross, a flying instructor, says that, on the evening of Tuesday November 9, he was in the vicinity of Syracuse airport, aboard a small aircraft with some of his pupils, when the lights failed. He said: 'We were flying above the power-line running to Clay from Niagara Falls, when we saw the ball of fire. It lasted for ten seconds.'

"Another person has also said that he saw a 'ball of fire' immediately after the lights went off."

3. Time (November 26) has the following letter:
"Sir,â€”If you look at certain pictures of blackout New York, you can see very plainly, hovering over the city, a flying saucer. Obviously the power failure November 9) was only a preliminary to a massive invasion by alien forces bent on destroying the human race. You must be relieved to know it wasn't Russian sabotage at all."

Harold F. Whitney,

4. Many readers will know that the American clairvoyant Mrs. Jean Dixon has been investigated and tested by psychiatrists and students of parapsychology, and is rated by some of them as ranking with the greatest seers and psychics of all time. See A Gift of Prophecy, by Ruth Montgomeryâ€”condensed in the Reader's Digest for August, 1965, under the title: The Crystal Ball). It is a matter of record that Mrs. Dixon has been interviewed by very puzzled Defence officials from the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency, anxious to learn the source of the highly secret and classified military and political information that has appeared in her "predictions". She has also been interviewed by the Soviet Ambassador in Washington,â€”understandably enoughâ€”was badly shaken when she predicted, in 1953, the launching of Russia's first sputnik, and gave the date for it too.

On August 14, 1963, Mrs. Dixon participated in a meeting called by a group of scientists for the purpose of probing her extrasensory gift. The scientists present included Dr. William Brewster, a research physicist at Walter Reed Army Hospital; Andrew Haley, general counsel for the International Astronautical Federation and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Dr. F. Regis Eisenman, a prominent psychiatrist; and James Shiner, Assistant to the director of Biotechnology and Human Research in NASA. After the meeting, Andrew Haley remarked that "apart from myself, Jean Dixon was more knowledgeable about rockets than anyone else in the room".

Because these scientists had been so eager to know more about future developments in the Space Race, Mrs. Dixon agreed to meditate on rockets that night, and let them know what she saw. After she had gone to bed, she had one of her visions, which came to her in the darkness and lit up the whole bedroom. She says: "I saw a silver ball, like the sputnik, rising out of Russia and going into a powerful missile which traveled round the globe to the left. Suddenly it switched course and travelled in the opposite direction. Beneath it America was all aglow, but as the missile turned, the lights of our country went out, leaving us in utter darkness. I interpreted this to mean that Russia has a secret type of missile for which we have no anti-missile missile. It is so powerful that it can completely immobilize our communications and lighting systems. It can also play havoc with the navigation of our planes".

This vision created consternation in Washington, and the C.I.A. and Pentagon were buzzing around her like bees next day, wanting to know "where she got it from". Vice-President of the U.S.A., Hubert Humphrey, let a cat out of the bag when he admitted to her: "We have been fearful of just such a development for some time."

5. If we assume, for the moment, that it is a fact that the USSR already has such a device and that this device caused the Green Blackout of November 9 and possibly also the Texas Blackout of December 3, then how are we to explain the following items: items relating to mysterious events as far back as 1952, more than five years before Russia's first sputnik.

6. To conclude, I refer readers to the vitally...

Sirs:

Enclosed is a UFO Report for your perusal. One of our investigators has concluded that the object sighted was probably the planet Jupiter and he most likely is correct but since Hanscom AFB received another UFO report in the same general area of this sighting, I thought you might be interested in this one. It would be very interesting if the other sighting reported to Hanscom AFB was of an object similar to the one described in the enclosed report.

EVALUATION OF UFO REPORT INVESTIGATION

Date: 29 November 1965

From: J. O'Neill

To: R. E. Fowler

Investigation Date: 24 November 1965

Observation Date: 13 November 1965

Observers: Miss Linda Williams
            855 Broadway, Raynham, Massachusetts
            Miss Laurie Guest
            89 Jackson Drive, Raynham, Massachusetts

Place of Observation: Norton Massachusetts (Girl Scout Camp)

A. General Review

This investigator interviewed the principals on the evening of 24 November 1965 from approximately 7:30 p.m. to approximately 8:30 p.m., in the presence of the father of Miss Guest, Mr. Gordon Guest.

Prior to my interview, both girls were in possession of NICAP report forms (short form) and had partially completed same.

It was impractical to individually question the girls, and in view of their prior work on the report forms, I deemed it meaningless to do so.

Questioning revealed that at least one (Miss Guest) had heard one or more of the recent radio broadcasts re. UFO activity, and both had read recent UFO clippings in the Boston papers as well as the complete week-long article in the Boston Herald pertaining to the Hill case.

During the questioning and subsequent discussion, various discrepancies appeared in the answers from each girl, and that in many instances difficulty was met in trying to obtain separate answers, since usually one (Miss Guest) would formulate an answer which was usually seconded by the other.

The most important variances in verbal answers with written answers are as follows:

1. Distance: (Written reports not completed)
   Neither girl had the slightest conception of distance. Answers over the questioning period ranged from "a few hundred feet" to "eight to ten miles".

2. Size: (Reports: apparent size of grapefruit, etc.)
   Both girls agreed that the object was "smaller than the full moon", "about the size of a helicopter a couple of fields length away" etc. They were startled to learn that a dime will cover a full moon, yet neither could approximate a more reasonable comparison.


- page 15 -

Here is the text from the document:

3. Motion: One girl couldn't describe motion while one (Miss Williams, see report) decided the object moved toward the moon and disappeared.

4. Sound: Report: humming)
Neither girl could say either when they became aware of noise, or why the noise was identified as emanating from the object. Verbal reports varied between a jet at great height and a fly caught in a window.

5. Position: Both agreed that they were facing north and the moon was to their right front (NE) and the moon was above and to the left of the object. One girl sketched the moon directly above the object while the other sketched the moon above and to the right of the object. (See reports)

B. Related Information

1. The father of Miss Guest informed me that although a confirmed non-believer of UFO himself, he was sure that his daughter had been something, and was definitely "slightly upset" by the experience.

2. In an attempt to eliminate astronomical bodies, I have considered Jupiter as the only probable "phenomenon", and reduced its position relative to the moon and relative to the position of the moon in the sky at the time and date of the observation. I used Boston as an approximate locale, since I know the latitude and longitude, and the variance between Boston and Raynham is minor.

Ephemeris Apparent Positions: 11/13/65 11:30 p.m.
Moon        R. Ascension   6 hrs. 43 min.    Declination   +26Â° 06 min.
Jupiter     R. Ascension   6 hrs. 02 min.    Declination   +23Â°

Reduction to local meridian places the moon approximately 45Â° above the Eastern horizon, and Jupiter approximately to the right and slightly above the moon.

Conclusion: Allowing for the variances noted above regarding size, position, motion, etc., and taking the father's statement into consideration, I have concluded that the girls did in fact see an unknown object, and that it was probably the planet Jupiter.

A combination of the lateness of the hour, the remote and unfamiliar location, lack of knowledge of astronomical phenomena coupled with the recent exposure and content of the Hill case could trigger the imagination to this extent.

Confluence, Penna.
27 November 1965

CLOSE SIGHTING IN PENNSYLVANIA: On the evening of November 27th, two teen-age boys in Confluence, Pennsylvania, saw a luminous cigar-shaped craft at very low altitude over the city. It seemed to be about ten feet in diameter, and no higher than a thousand feet in altitude. Its most astonishing feature was the way it moved with a zigzag motion, unlike a normal aircraft. Both boys stated that although the ship was traveling at high speed in an irregular patch, its outline was very distinct. Then, suddenly, it came to a complete stop, turned on its end, and shot upward at incredible speed. It disappeared from sight "in no time at all," according to the report. (Somerset, Pa. Daily American, 11/29/65)

Argentina
24 Nov 65

ARGENTINE PLANE NEARLY CRASHES WITH UFO: Still another case of UFOs endangering the relatively lightly-traveled South American air lanes, occurred on the 24th of November. Captain Longo of the Argentine National Airline was coming in for a landing at Resistencia, en route from Rio de Janeiro, at about 9:45 p.m., when a brightly-lit UFO at him on a collision course. Longo made a "tragic maneuver" to change course, while the mysterious object headed upwards at a 45 degree angle and disappeared rapidly from view. The pilot claimed later that the object missed his plane by only about 100 yards. The same UFO was observed visually by personnel at the airport's control tower.

MORE DATA ON ADDITIONAL U.F.O. REPORT

A path of lights were seen in November 28, 1965, at 2:00 A.M. Witnessed by mother, and sister. Were observed in Belascos 50 power. Were flying north at approx. 600 mph. Three sizes were observed in same formation. The biggest size was like Venus. The smallest could only be seen thru telescope. Appeared like disk in telescope. Approx. altitude, over 50,000 feet. Biggest light was white, next size, orange, smallest, red.

Were controlled. At times stopped, and spread out over sky, then got back in formation, and began moving north again. Sighting lasted about 15 minutes.

Condition of weather was good. Cool, about 56 degrees. Scattered clouds. Dry. Humidity was very low. Barometer was about 30.20 inches of mercury and holding steady.

These objects were craft. Were seen thru telescope. Did flying stunts. Observed by three people. My whole family, and myself will take a lie detector test anytime. If you wish more information, let me know.

Saw same thing week later, but only 18 objects. Have not seen it since.

Drawing below will show formation.

FOR RELEASE: June 21, 1967

Release No. 67-24

ROCKET EXPERIMENT TIMED
WITH TWO SATELLITE PASSES AT WALLOPS

A rocket experiment coordinated with overpasses of two satellites was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at Wallops Island, Va., at 3:02 p.m. EDT today.

An ionosphere experiment prepared jointly by the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies, Dallas, Texas, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., was launched on a 4-stage Javelin rocket. The launch was coordinated with overpasses of the Canadian satellite, Alouette II, and the U. S. satellite, Explorer XXXI, launched "piggyback" into polar orbits by a Thor-Agena B from the Western Test Range in California November 29, 1965. The Javelin probe was sent up between the two satellite passes.

Primary objective of the flight was to measure properties of the ionosphere--ion composition, concentration and temperature and electron concentration and temperature--and to correlate the

-more-

results with simultaneous measurements made by the two
satellites. The ionosphere is a region of charged particles
in the upper atmosphere.

The launch vehicle was a 48-foot Javelin (ARGO D-4) sound-
ing rocket. The 120-pound payload was boosted to a peak altitude
of 493 statute miles. Data were telemetered to ground stations
during the flight. No recovery operation was involved.

Project Scientist is Thomas W. Flowerday of the Southwest
Center for Advanced Studies. R. G. Plihal was the Goddard
Vehicle Manager. William L. Lord was Project Engineer for
Wallops Station, with Paul A. White serving as Launch Pad
Supervisor.

Dear Sir:

Sir my name is [blacked out]. Sir is below that the flying saucer w/ 20.70.0Â° off of the anti-gravity force field on the crystal property of the flying saucer refines all the electro-magnetic and corpuscular energies into varying figures, cis and wave lengths.

Sir is am 16 years old and have been studying the U.F.O. field for more than three years now and hope to make a career and of it.

Sir that you in november 8/1965 i was in clay and kentucky driving, and at 7:30 p.m. i was looking in the sky w/ my 20.5 mm telescope and as to what i saw was no star, planet, comet, balloon, not anything but a unidentifying space i which controlled intellectual fly saucer controls. Sir is now two objects shaped like same w/side same speed, same size. They were 30 to 35 feet in diameter, traveling from west to west when they recorded same other sky


- page 24 -

Here is the text from the document:

stopped for about 15 seconds. they were
traveling at 150 miles per hour to my estim-
ate. they were about 5,000 feet in the sky.
so in the objects it observed didn't have
any sound, or was it after behind close as
a airplane does. this the objects were clean
going colors from red, green to yellowish
to white and blue.

this we left as saw was no enemy
air craft because they jig, jacked, and
stayed up aerial air.

this if you have an photos, or in-
formation on r.f.o.'s or flying saucers
is sure would appreciate it.

yours truly,

P.S. here is a drawing of what
is seen in November of 1965 at 4:30 in
the night.

Thank you.

Dear Sir,

I read one article magazine that there is something called St Elmo's Fire, & I was wondering if that is what my friend & I saw last December (about then)

At the time, was nearly & at about 5:30, we saw there 3 lights in the sky. They looked like headlights on a car some 5pm a distance. One went out, then the other went out. Later that evening, when it was dark, I saw them again, & again they went out. Was it St Elmo's Fire? They didn't look like fire.

They were just lights. +
