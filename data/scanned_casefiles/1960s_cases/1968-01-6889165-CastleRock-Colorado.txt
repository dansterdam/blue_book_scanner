Castle Rock UFO: How Eyes Catch...

THIS "Identified flying object" near Castle Rock this week was spotted by two men who were driving on Highway 86 and may have cast a good deal of light on the UFO phenomenon in the United States.

What they saw in the Castle Rock area during daylight was a rectangular-shaped object that hovered briefly, then moved off in a sort of a half-circle or half-arc pattern.

A study of their description suggests the object was held a steady course to catch the object for several seconds, which is more than most UFO sightings provide.

Castle Rock is located in Douglas County, 25 miles south of Denver. The two men who saw the object are considered reliable observers.

What happened is Castle Rock is another in a series of puzzling UFO incidents that continue to intrigue people from all walks of life.

It is normal to be skeptical, but it is equally important to keep an open mind. The night sky and daylight hours have produced many reports of unidentified flying objects that cannot easily be explained away.

Neither of these men, of course, had cameras or other equipment to record what they saw. But their description of the UFO tallies with many other reports that have been made from earth.

But Castle Rock is only one of many places where UFO sightings have been reported. They seem to be everywhere, and people who see them come from all walks of life.

It is not all of these sightings that can be explained in terms of natural phenomena, weather balloons, aircraft or other known objects.

U. S. officials and scientists continue to study the UFO phenomenon, but so far have not come up with final answers.
