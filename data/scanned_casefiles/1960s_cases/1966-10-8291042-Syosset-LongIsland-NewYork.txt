11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer saw a round shaped object with a orange halo and a silver dome. The object was the size of a table. It emitted intense light and flashes. It was sitting on a transmission wire and looked at one time like lightning had struck the wire.

Long Island Lighting Company reported that the wires near the observer's house were sparking. They trimmed the trees at the area and apparently the trouble was solved.

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this form with your OD report in the morning.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CAC, Ext 493. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the sightings than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
