Dear Sirs

I would like to report a UFO:

It was the night of September 17, 1967. In Killeen Texas, at 8:10 P.M. it (the UFO) started out in the southeastern part of the sky, it went very slowly across the sky as a normal satellite, but when it got to the eastern part of the sky it didn't follow the curvature of the earth. It seemed to stop in mid-air, and went to the right 25 degrees dropped 20 degrees. When it was dropping there seemed to be a small white circling clockwise very fast around the UFO.

The time was 8:20, it stopped and seemed to fade out. At 8:30 it faded out.

It made no noise, flying above the clouds, (it was a P.C. night) no wings seemed to be circular in shape, and was 2½ times brighter than the brightest star.

Sincerely

[Signature area is blacked out]
