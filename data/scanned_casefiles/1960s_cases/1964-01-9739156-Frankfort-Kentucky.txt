MUFF DATA

Frankfort, Kentucky
February 3, 1964

Lt. Robert Hofstetter
Member of Defense
Columbus, O.

My dear Mr. Hofstetter:

Something is puzzling me very much and I thought perhaps you could answer this for me.

Late in October, early in the evening, my ten year old grandson and I stood in the eastern sky, not too high above the horizon, that appeared to be a very brilliant star - a large one that looked like a big round ball. It was very bright and soon disappeared in the distance.

On Wednesday of this week, January 22th, while watching for the new Echo II to appear, I was not looking just which direction it would come from. I noticed a large star which I thought was the Echo II and was surprised with the result. I immediately phoned a friend to look at the same, and he too saw it. I tried to see it again, with no success. I noticed it had a trail of smoke behind. I can only guess at its distance, but I disposed it was quickly. My friend called me back to say simply that he did not see me, but he saw a trail of smoke.

My question is, what is this amazing thing we have seen? Had I not seen the trail of smoke, I would have thought it the Echo.

I might add, that I found the Echo II and watched it as it did fly. Being on earth, watcher still of Echo I. To me, they are the most amazing things I have seen.

Thank you for any information you can give me.

Very truly yours,

[Signature redacted]
Frankfort, Ky.

Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

This is in reply to your letter of February 1, 1964, addressed to the Secretary of Defense, in which you requested information on an unusual phenomena you witnessed last October, and again on January 29th.

It is difficult to evaluate what the object or objects were that you saw without additional details such as description or size, shape or color, direction, and elevation, and exact time and location. However, previous reports of this nature which were investigated by the Air Force have almost invariably resulted in an evaluation of a meteor or a high-flying aircraft.

We appreciate your report of this sighting and it is regretted that more enlightening answer cannot be given.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information
