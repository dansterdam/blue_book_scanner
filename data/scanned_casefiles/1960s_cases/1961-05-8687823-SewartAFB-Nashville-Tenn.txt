Nashville 14, Tennessee
June 28, 1961

Maj. William T. Coleman

Washington D. C.

Dear Sir:

Thank you very much for your letter of 20 June 1961, concerning the sighting over Nashville and Memphis of May 27, 1961.

The balloon was sighted over Memphis at 7pm and over Nashville at 8pm also above sightings were made between Memphis and Nashville. According to the Weather Bureau at Perry Field, Nashville, Tennessee, there was no wind above 50,000 feet anywhere in Tennessee with a velocity over 15 knots.

The Nashville Tennessean-called the Strategic Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs (STRAC officials know nothing about the balloon which was of course still a local TV station employee positively identified the object. While a local TV station employee positively identified the object as a balloon, other persons through the obvious balloon telescope-camera positively identified the object as not being a conventional balloon.

Could this device whether balloon or otherwise be powered to have moved this distance in the 2 hour period with only a 8 to 15 knot wind? I would appreciate your comment.

Yours truly,

24 Jun 1961

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Thank you for your letter of June 29th.

I shall attempt to be more explicit concerning the sighting you refer to since my apparently unclear way of stating a conclusion.

Your logic is good in reaching the conclusion you breach since it would be difficult to conclude that a balloon 15 knots an hour could travel the distance from Memphis to Nashville in two hours. However, the position of balloons at extremely high altitudes are definitely unless exact calculations and altitudes (above horizon) are given.

Additionally, the movements of balloons must be correlated from the beginning of the flight profile to the radiosondes for only about two hours, 179 or take several minutes. So that you and I fully understand each other and to attempt to rule out one of the evidently erroneous conclusions, I will have to ask that you furnish me separate (clear) position reports on the two objects flying at altitude and time, each from a known location (longitude and latitude).

There is no organization in the Department of Defense known as the Strategic Air Defense Command. You are probably referring to CINC NORAD, American Air Defense Command, located at Colorado Springs, Colorado. USAF is the abbreviation for Strategic Air Corps Hq, as was the case during the Korean War with launching and recovery of microsonde and radiosonde.

From two to twelve balloons of various configurations are launched daily from over 100 locations throughout the United States. The magnitude of even the smaller balloons at extremely high altitudes is such, late in the afternoon, to make the balloon appear larger than its actually is. A radiosonde, considering its configuration, could easily be classed as a conventional balloon since here are several ways ranging from from 12, a universal, but closed radiosonde and an existing box containing a small radio transmitter. The parachute and mode of suspension by radiosonde, correspondingly make as the balloon ascends. Also, the balloon increases in size (due to lessening atmospheric pressure) as it rises. When the balloon reaches maximum altitude it bursts and sends the payload uniformly in all directions.

The extremely low temperatures at the burst point and cooling of the maximum stretch of the balloon add to the rather spectacular flight termination. The parachute does not "balloon" until it reaches much lower altitudes (where air becomes dense enough to force the chute to open).

Request for UFO Analysis

1. ATIC received a letter from Mr. [redacted] reporting the sighting of a UFO and requesting the analysis of same. A check of our files reveals that the sighting reported by Mr. [redacted] was reported by Sewart AFB, Tennessee, 28 May 1961.

2. Jacks Creek Radio, located about 93 nautical miles southwest of Nashville, reported that a balloon was at high altitude northeast of their location. A local TV station employee watched the object through a telescope and positively identified the object as a balloon far enough below the horizon, the object passed into the earth's shadow, then it could no longer be seen. The Navy pilots, while flying at 47,000 feet, saw the object and judged it to be a balloon.

3. ATIC has concluded the object was probably the high altitude balloon reported by Jacks Creek Radio. This conclusion is substantiated by the fact that one ground observer (and two Navy pilots) definitely identified it as a balloon.

Dear Sir:

On May 27, 1961, there appeared a large triangular-shaped object over Nashville, Tennessee. To one from the Weather Bureau to the Knoxville Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs knew nothing about the object. STRAC officials said there was no record of anything-plus. Plans of nearby Air Force units over this area at the time.

Some former Air Force men said it looked to them like a large delta-wing. One amateur astronomer viewed the object through a telescope and said it appeared to be shaped like a pyramid and that it dangled a long cable with an instrument protruding.

Jets tried to reach the object they went to 47,000 feet. Pilots said that the object was at 60,000. One military officer said that he was convinced that it was not a balloon. The object was seen by thousands.

Evidently this object did not belong to the U.S. Could it have been a Russian device either a craft or a gas filled container propelled by a clear propulsion or jet. According to the Western Union release from Field, the wind velocity above 50,000 feet was only 5 to 15 knots. The object was much faster than the wind. A weather balloon release was made only 30 minutes before the object appeared over Nashville. The object was over Memphis, Tennessee at 4pm and Nashville at 6pm.

Will you please give me the explanation? I anxiously await your reply.

Yours truly,

2.     Jacks Creek Radio, located about 93 nautical miles southwest of Nashville, reported that a balloon was at high altitude northeast of their location. A local TV station employee watched the object through a telescope and positively identified the object as a balloon or box underneath attached to a cable. When the sun was far enough below horizon, the object raised into the earth's shadow, then it could no longer be seen. Two Navy pilots, while flying at 47,000 feet, saw the object and judged it to be a balloon.

3.     ATIC has concluded the object was probably the high altitude balloon reported by Jacks Creek Radio. This conclusion is substantiated by the fact that one ground observer (and two Navy pilots) definitely identified it as a balloon.

20 June 1961

Dear T. [redacted]:

Your letter of 15 June addressed to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center has been referred to this office.

ATIC has investigated the sighting you reported. Stewart AFB, located 68 nautical miles southwest of Nashville, reported that a balloon was at high altitude overhead of their location. A local TV station was watching through a telescope and positively identified the object as a balloon with a low overhead altitude. A radar station was able to track the object enough below the horizon, the object passed into the earth's shadow; then it could no longer be seen. The Navy filter center at 17,000 feet saw the object and judged it to be a balloon.

ATIC conclusion is that the object you saw was probably the high altitude balloon reported by Jack Creek Area Radio (PAL).

This line of the year balloon lifts radiosondes across extremely high altitudes, often driving the appearance of bright points of metal. The angle of reflected sunlight accounts for the various shapes reported. The balloon reaches altitudes of 70,000 feet, sometimes higher.

I hope this information is helpful.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN
