22 JUNE 1963

Reynoldsville, Penna
June 24, 1963

Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sir,

I would like to report a
U.F.O. sighting.
I was outside in the yard of June 23 1963
with my friend
We were looking at the stars though my
telescope when [blacked out] looked up and coming
out of the West was a bright object that
was egg shaped.

While in color [blacked out] wanting to tell me
it was a satellite but I refused to believe this.
Then [blacked out] it stopped completely. It sped
that it was a U.F.O.
After it started again it turned to the
most and went over the trees in a North
Easterly direction.

Very Sincerely,
[signature blacked out]
