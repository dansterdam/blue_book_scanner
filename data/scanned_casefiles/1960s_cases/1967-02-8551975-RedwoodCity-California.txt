Dear Sir,

I am sending negatives of two colored pictures which we now have. These were taken by two male friends of ours, both about twenty-nine, three miles east of Boston, Pa. The time was late afternoon on Fri. 6.2.

The sight was sighted as my friends drove some years before. They turned the car around and took these pictures. It was a gray color.

After having seen the film for several months the object was straight up until it was out of sight. It was at least thirty ft. in dia. and about 150 yds. away.

Could you please send me a copy of the Blue Book.

Analysis of Inorganic Compound

Major Kenneth B. Becker
SAFOI-LA
Los Angeles Office of Information
Los Angeles, California 90025

1. Reference your letter of 14 February 1967 in which you
forwarded a physical specimen for chemical and metallurgical
analysis.

2. X-ray emission spectroscopy revealed the presence of stron-
tium, barium, potassium, and sulfur. Other minor chemical
elements such as iron, boron, aluminum, and calcium were also
found. It is suspected that the specimen was the extract of
a flare or fireworks display since the principal chemicals found
were strontium and potassium which are major elements of some
types of fireworks.

3. Request that you inform the local citizen of our results.
There was no evidence disclosed to indicate the material was
extraterrestrial in nature.

I apologize, but the text in this image is very difficult to read clearly. The document appears to be a typewritten or handwritten page with some sections that are blurry or obscured. There is a redacted/blacked out section in the middle of the page. The page has three hole punches on the right side, suggesting it is from a report or file. At the bottom of the page, there are some numbers and text, but I cannot confidently transcribe them due to the poor image quality.

ANALYSIS TEST REPORT

SUBJECT: Analysis of Living Tissue Compared
TEST NR: T-393                                   TASK NR: GRC 1262
SUBMITTED BY: W. Morley T. Det. Pres.            DATE RECEIVED: 17 FEB 61
PURPOSE: To analyze morgue material

FACTUAL DATA:

1. X-ray emission spectography showed
Sr, Ba, K, S and Cl to be present.

2. X-ray diffraction gave a very complex
pattern that could not be identified. The
sample was annealed at 50°C within soluble simple and an insoluble
simple. The insoluble simple was
identified as Sr-Sigt plus a small amount
of unidentified phase. Infrared spectroscopy
showed a complete match of the soluble
phase could not be identified but appears
to be a carbonate.

CONCLUSIONS: Nine data submitted for conclusion by

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Request your office analyze the enclosed material and furnish this activity with information on results.

The substance was turned in to this office by a local citizen who reports that it burned holes through leaves and branches of a tree in his back yard as it fell, and narrowly missed the roof of his garage.

Any information you can provide will hopefully aid this office in giving the gentleman who turned in the material some logical explanation.

Dear Kay:

Enclosed is the report of the interview I had with Mrs. [redacted] and her husband were driving along Route 15 outside of Hartford Connecticut when she noticed the object through her windshield. Her husband did the same. The object was stationary above the highway and was very bright. Her husband was reluctant to say too much only that there were people pulled off to the side of the road looking at the object.

I doubled back on my questioning to see if she would give me a different answer but she didn't. She said she had a negative outlook on the UFO question untill now.

I wanted to get more information like a drawing but her husband was just leaving for work and I had to make it brief.

I hope this report is to your satisfaction.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

I apologize, but the text on this page appears to be handwritten and mostly illegible. While I can see there is handwritten text on the page, I cannot confidently transcribe the specific words due to the cursive and somewhat blurry nature of the writing. There is a number "13,936" at the top of the page, and some text appears to be crossed out or redacted with a black mark, but the details of the text are not clear enough for me to accurately reproduce.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT

The witness was proceeding NE on Route #133 Andover when his attention was attracted to a triangular cluster of bright lights estimated to be about 300 feet off the road and contained 1000-1500 ft. altitude over the Andover Country Club grounds. The witness tried to stop his car for a better look but traffic around him prevented a full stop. He observed the object through his front and side window at 10-15 mph. Upon reaching home "Wavernus" phoned me and I in turn phoned Mr. [redacted] to report his account of the sighting. Since the sighting was made by one person and was of a very short duration, no personal interview was arranged. The report will be used for information purposes and possible comparison with other sightings reported in the past. It will be used as supplementary information to any other report of a similar phenomena reported on this date.

SKETCH OF UFO(s)

REMARKS

Interesting things to note are: 1) The absence of "green" lights of a conventional aircraft; 2) The lights were steady, not flashing; 3) The "apparent" hovering; 4) The fact that a UFO was reported earlier at Foxboro, Massachusetts which carried Red & White lights on the same evening.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning your unidentified observation. Examination of the submitted data fails to reveal a positively identifiable, primarily because of the lack of essential data such as flight characteristics, angular velocity, and how the object disappeared.

No other unidentified flying objects were submitted to the Air Force from the vicinity of Clawson, Michigan for February 8, 1967.

At this late date a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible. It is important for an individual to report his observation to the Air Force as soon as possible after the sighting, and enable a comprehensive analysis to perform a meaningful investigation. The submitted information will be added to the present data for possible future reference.

Dear [redacted]

Reference your recent letter reporting your unusual observation to the Air Force. A detailed investigation did not reveal a positive identification; however, our analysis were able to uncover a possible solution. The description you provided is very consistent with that normally reported for an observation of a hot air balloon. The Air Force has been plagued lately with reports from all parts of the country of these hot air balloons. Persons of all ages have been releasing these balloons which are made from dry cleaning bags with candles situated on a platform of some type. As previously mentioned, a positive identification was not made but we feel that you more than likely observed one of these balloons.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

There is one main factor which convinced me that the pilot of any kind was not present.

Considering the apparent nearness of the object, extreme brightness of the electronic bright lights, the fact that I obscured it as it approached, was directly opposite, and then as it went away from me.

Considering the sky; low in type.

Considering that the wind was fairly calm and the area right at the town line limits was perfectly quiet.

There was no sound coming from the object, at any time while I observed it.
