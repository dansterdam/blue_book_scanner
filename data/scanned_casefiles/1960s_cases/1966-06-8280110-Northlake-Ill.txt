June 28th 1966
I am sorry for writing to you so promptly, but I wanted to report the sighting of a unidentified object which I believe occurred at 7:15 PM (time?) and the following will give you more information. A public official, to wit, a Park Police Officer, was observing the object through binoculars and reported that the object appeared to be about twenty feet in length, with a whitish light attached to the under side of the object and it was stationary in the sky for twenty minutes with no visible means of propulsion, just hovering there. It finally descended slowly and vanished behind a building. I thought this information might be of interest to you.
Sincerely, (signed)

"The object had three apparater. The eraler escaping or taking off from the ground made a sound like radio stations interfer. The object hover over the trees and than took off at a high speed."

"Sandra said there was a dome on top. It floated over them slowly and then had a cloud since the underneath seemed to be irridecent. There were no openings or windows seen on the underside remote side."
