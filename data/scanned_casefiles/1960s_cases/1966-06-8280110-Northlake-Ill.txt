June 20th 1966

Dear Sir -

I am writing to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object last night at 9:25 P.M. (June 19th). I was the first to see the object as we looked out the bedroom window to the north.

It was moving eastward, had a pale yellow color, was glowing and flashing on and off and appeared to be about twenty feet in length with a bell-type span as measuring gauge. She called for Sarah, her daughter who also saw it describing it similarly. Sarah then started for me to look.

I saw the object moving east, glowing on and off and then disappear behind a building. Duration of flight was perhaps two minutes and it was a beautiful sight.

Send 14Â¢. Thank You.

The object had the appearance. The circles on the shape were flashing in sequence, say thus, blinking and fading. The center object glowed on and off.

Sandi said there were a dome on top. The shape below the ellipse could have been a cloak since the underside seemed to be broken as shown.

[The text is accompanied by a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO with a saucer-like shape, featuring a series of circles around its circumference and a dome on top.]
