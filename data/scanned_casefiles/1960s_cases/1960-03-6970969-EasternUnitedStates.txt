LITTLE SILVER, N. J.                                                Mar. 17, 1960

Gentlemen:

This is for the purpose of reporting the sighting of what, so far as we were concerned, were unidentified flying objects on the evening of March 7, 1960, at 2017 EST in the vicinity of lat 40° 13'N, 70° 43'W. Three of us were on board a 38 ft auxiliary ketch en route from Nassau to Chat Point, in the Berry Is., Bill; the owner, my wife, and myself. The weather and myself were on deck, my wife was below at the initial sighting.

The objects appeared midway between Polaris and Cassiopeia and appeared to be seven in number, arranged as follows:

[There is a hand-drawn sketch/diagram at this point, but the details are not clear]

All appeared to be travelling exactly the same course and speed. The course was generally southerly, so they were moving roughly from our right to left, as we were on about 310° T, but at the same time they appeared to be sliding very rapidly. They were what I would guess to be "scatter Car away," which could have been anything from 15 to 100 miles. We heard no sound relative to this at all.

Several seconds after my initial observation, having satisfied myself that they were not a constellation and that they were moving, I called Mr. Hatch's attention to them. He confirmed my observation, and I then called to my wife to come up and see them. She did at about 15 sec after my first sighting. In this interval 6 of the 7 had vanished, one after the other, in the order 9 7 5 3 0 A, leaving only B, which she saw, and which then vanished in about another 5 sec.

All the objects had about the same color, a light orange; size, roughly as I have drawn them viewed from about 6 ft; and brightness, except for B which was noticeably brighter than the others. Very approximately, their brightness was halfway between Betelgeuse and Sirius but more orange than the former.

I have been wondering if these might have been jet planes with afterburners on, but the Format in second a little unusual for this, and if they were they must have been much closer than my guess and we should have been able to hear them. I would be much interested in knowing whether you have had any other reports of this particular incident.

Yours very truly,

leaving only B, which she saw and which then vanished

Sir:

At 2010 hrs. this evening, I sighted a strange object flying at about 10,000 feet, flying at about 600+ hrs. This object was heading in a south-south-westerly direction.

This object was colored a green or white, and gave off no apparent sound. In aircraft, either conventional or jet, would have made some sound, flying under similar conditions.

This object had no apparent red or green running lights. Only the constant rate to 14,145 light.

The circumstances for this sighting are as follows: I was walking in the north direction from the Gaines when this bird 2nd moving object caught my eye. I watched it moving in a straight line of flight until it entered a cloud bank. The total time of the sighting could not be more than fifteen to twenty seconds.

Any additional information on this object will be sent to you on request.

Collective sighting of an UFO
Sighting over Navy Sanford
Date - 3/7/60
Time - 2015R

On 7 March 1960 about 2015R while orbiting NAS Sanford at 8000 feet in an 43-1 type aircraft, we sighted 9 bright white objects on a heading of 0280 out of Navy Sanford. At first nothing, however, appeared to be over Daytona Beach, however, this crew has no idea of their distance from Navy Sanford. They appeared to be over the coast and slightly above the horizon. They resembled nothing this crew has ever seen before. They were by no means conventional aircraft.

A head-on view of the object revealed one large white light, accompanied by several smaller ones of a lesser intensity. As they passed abeam us (90°) they appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, parallel to the horizon. They were strong flare type or extremely hot gases a tremendous distance out. We counted 9 distinct objects. The fire or hot looking gas was trailing approximately 100 times the diameter of the lead object. We "clocked" the lead object on a heading of 180°. They did not appear to burn out, but our crew was unable to do so due to a fractured wind windshield.

FOR THE RECORD:

According to the National Space Surveillance Center, Bedford, Massachusetts, the satellite carrier of DISCOVER VIII wandered the earth's atmosphere and decompressed at approximately 3 p.m. March 7, 1960.

This time coincides with the so-called meteor sighting reported on March 7th. DISCOVER VIII wandered the observatory on the 1950th revolution around the earth.

URGENT
WASHINGTON, MARCH 7--(UPI)--A STREAM OF BRILLIANT LIGHTS SEEN STREAKING ACROSS THE SKY OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES TONIGHT ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN A METEOR, AIR FORCE OFFICIALS SAID TONIGHT.

THE OFFICIALS SAID IN A STATEMENT RELEASED BY THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT THAT THE LIGHTS WERE SEEN AS FAR NORTH AS LAKE ERIE AND AS FAR SOUTH AS KEY WEST, FLA.

THEY WERE REPORTED BY AIRLINE PILOTS, AIR FORCE PILOTS, STATE POLICE AND CONTROL TOWERS.

AN OPERATION IN AN AIRPORT CONTROL TOWER AT ROANOKE, VA., REPORTED WITNESSING THE METEOR BREAK INTO THREE PIECES, THE AIR FORCE SAID. FARTHER SOUTH, IT WAS REPORTED AS THREE SEPARATE LIGHTS.

THE METEOR MOVED GENERALLY NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST.

THE DISPLAY OF LIGHTS WAS VISIBLE OFF CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA., THE NATION'S EAST COAST MISSILE-LAUNCHING BASE.

SOME OBSERVERS HAD SPECULATED THAT LIGHTS MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM A MISSILE NOSE CONE BURNING UP ON RE-ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE.

THERE ALSO HAD BEEN SPECULATION THAT RUSSIA'S SPUTNIK II MAY HAVE RE-ENTERED THE ATMOSPHERE, CAUSING THE DISPLAY IT IS EXPECTED TO COME CLOSE ENOUGH TO EARTH TO BURN UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE SOMETIME THIS MONTH.

(ABOVE IS A LEAD FOR EAST COAST B-WIRE POINTS ON DISPATCH DATELINED GREENSBORO, N.C. (ANNIE). IT MAY BE PICKED UP AT 3RD PSN BEGINNING--A WINSTON-SALEM, ETC.)

[REDACTED], CHIEF, COMBAT INTELLIGENCE BRANCH, WING INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, 72ND BOMBARDMENT WING. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THIS SIGHTING WOULD INDICATE A POSSIBLE REENTRY OF SOME VARIETY OF BALLISTIC MISSILE OR EARTH SATELLITE VEHICLE. THE MANNER IN WHICH OBJECT DISAPPEARED (SEE ITEM B(5) ABOVE) IS THE PRIMARY SUPPORT FOR THIS ANALYSIS. ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATED AZIMUTH WHEN FIRST SIGHTED COMPARED TO AZIMUTH UPON DISAPPEARANCE WOULD INDICATE MOVEMENT FROM EAST TO WEST OBSERVER WAS NOT POSITIVE OF THESE FIGURES, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EXTREMELY SHORT TIME THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED. BECAUSE OF THE SHORT DURATION OF THIS SIGHTING, DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT AS INDICATED IN ITEM 3 ABOVE IS NOT CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE BY THE PREPARING OFFICER.

URGENT

CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA., MARCH 7 --(UPI)--A MYSTERIOUS FORMATION OF FLAMING, COLORED LIGHTS FLASHED ACROSS THREE SOUTHEASTERN STATES TONIGHT, TOUCHING OFF AN AIR FORCE INVESTIGATION AND SPECULATION THAT THE SOVIET SATELLITE LUNIK III HAD FALLEN TO EARTH.

THE AMAZING LIGHTS WERE SEEN OVER THE U.S. SPACEPORT AROUND 8:10 P.M., SOME 10 MINUTES AFTER THEY WERE FIRST SPOTTED OVER NORTH CAROLINA AND LATER OVER SOUTH CAROLINA.

THE WASHINGTON SPACE AGENCY CONFIRMED THAT LUNIK III, THE MASSIVE RUSSIAN ROCKET THAT TOOK PICTURES OF THE FARSIDE OF THE MOON, WAS EXPECTED TO PLUNGE INTO THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE IN MARCH.

THE SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL LABORATORY AT CAMBRIDGE, MASS., HAS BEEN THE AGENCY WHICH KEPT TRACK OF SATELLITES ONCE THEY WERE LAUNCHED.

HOWEVER, OFFICIALS AT THE SMITHSONIAN LAB SAID THEY COULD GIVE NO EXPLANATION FOR THE LIGHTS, WHICH TRIGGERED A SMALL FLURRY OF FLYING SAUCER TALK.

AN AIR FORCE SPOKESMAN HERE TOLD UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL THAT "THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE ARE INVESTIGATING."

MISSILE MEN HERE SAID THAT THE LIGHTS "DEFINITELY LOOKED LIKE A SATELLITE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO LOOK" IN FALLING BACK TO EARTH, WITH THE RED-HEAT OF AIR FRICTION TEARING IT APART.

OBSERVERS AT WINSTON-SALEM, HIGH POINT, SATTSVILLE AND CHARLOTTE, IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND AT COLUMBIA, S.C., REPORTED SEEING THE BRIGHT LIGHTS FLAME ACROSS THE SKY. ONE WITNESS SAID HE SAW FIVE SEPARATE PIECES OF LIGHT WITH AN ORANGE OR WHITE FLAME BETWEEN THEM.

THE LIGHTS, WHICH ALSO MOVED IN THE CAPE TRAVELED IN A SCATTERING GENERALLY NORTH-NORTHWEST TO SOUTH-SOUTHEAST, APPARENTLY AT HIGH ALTITUDE AND AT HIGH SPEED, CURVING GRACEFULLY TO THE HORIZON DUE EAST.

THE LIGHTS STARTED AS A CLOSELY-COLLECTED MASS OF FLAMING COLORS--RED, BLUE, GREEN, ORANGE AND YELLOW--THEN SPREAD OUT AS THEY SHOT THROUGH SPACE.

THROUGH BINOCULARS, THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE FAST-MOVING BALLS OF A MOLTEN SUBSTANCE, PERHAPS METAL, FALLING APART. THE DISPLAY LASTED ABOUT THREE MINUTES BEFORE DIMMING INTO BLACKNESS.

SIMULTANEOUSLY, ANOTHER SLOWER-MOVING OBJECT TRAVELED OVER THE CAPE IN THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION. BUT ITS LIGHT WAS A BRILLIANT WHITE, TRAILING A FAINT TAIL OF LIGHT WHICH DISAPPEARED INTO THE SOUTHEAST, THEN MADE A RETURN TRIP.

THIS OBJECT LEFT A VAPOR TRAIL FAINTLY VISIBLE THROUGH BINOCULARS AND ITS LIGHTS WERE SIMILAR TO THE STROBE LIGHTS WHICH FLASH ABOARD MANY MISSILES LAUNCHED AT CAPE CANAVERAL AT NIGHT. STROBE LIGHTS ARE USED TO ENABLE BALLISTIC CAMERAS TO TRACK MISSILES ACCURATELY.

Agencies in Disagreement
On Mystery Lights

A press release by UPI, datelined
Washington, revealed that the Air Force
was investigating reports of a mysterious flying object which appeared
centered in the 10 to 15 mile area
north to the U.S. Air Force Department.

The lights were seen in the north as
far south as New York.

The Force officials in Washington said
the lights have believed to have been
caused by a meteor. Meteormen at Cape
Canaveral however said the lights
hardly looked like a meteor at all.

The National Space Agency in Washington confirmed the fact that under 15,
the large Soviet rocket which put the
artificial satellite around the moon
was expected to fall into the earth's
atmosphere in March.

Officials at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory at Cambridge,
Massachusetts, which keeps track of satellites once they are launched, said that
the lights, which were reported by airline
pilots, Air Force pilots, state police and
civilian observers, had not been explained
by them—they simply couldn't explain
them.

Observed through binoculars, the objects appeared to be fast moving balls of
molten substance, perhaps metal, which
were falling apart and which appeared
to have descended into the atmosphere.

They were observed at Cape Canaveral
at 8:10 p.m. in midair after they were
spotted over North Carolina. The display
of luminous balls of fire continued
over supporting the blackness
of the night. Three minute observations
of these objects could not be categorized
as meteors, and more confirmation could
be needed.

UFO SIGHTING
EASTERN UNITED STATES
7 March 1960

On March 1960 between the hours of 2010 and 2027 witnesses along the east coast of the United States from Maine to Florida, and airborne witnesses as far west as Ohio, reported sighting an unidentified flying object. The object was described as a flaming, formation of bright lights having a shape like an ice cream cone. The object was reported as a very brilliant white trailing off to a bright red. Many witnesses reported that the object broke into several pieces. The lights moved generally in a broad area from the northwest to the southeast at a high altitude and at great speed. The display was reported to have lasted approximately three minutes.

This object was determined to be the decay and re-entry of satellite 1959 Lambda. (Discover VIII)

UPI A8

CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA., MARCH 8 --(UPI)-- AIR FORCE OFFICIALS TODAY INVESTIGATED REPORTS OF A MYSTERIOUS STREAM OF BRILLIANT LIGHTS THAT FLASHED ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES LAST NIGHT.

THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT SAID IN A STATEMENT THE LIGHTS WERE SEEN AS FAR NORTH AS LAKE ERIE AND AS FAR SOUTH AS KEY WEST, FLA.

AIR FORCE OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON SAID THE LIGHTS WERE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A METEOR. THE SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY AT CAPE CANAVERAL SAID THE LIGHTS "DEFINITELY LOOKED" LIKE A SATELLITE AS IT FELL BACK TO EARTH WITH THE RED-HEAT OF AIR FRICTION TEARING IT APART.

THE NATIONAL SPACE AGENCY IN WASHINGTON CONFIRMED THAT LUNIK III, THE HUGE SOVIET ROCKET THAT TOOK PICTURES OF THE FARSIDE OF THE MOON, WAS EXPECTED TO PLUNGE INTO THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE THIS MONTH.

HOWEVER, OFFICIALS AT THE SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL LABORATORY AT CAMBRIDGE, MASS., WHICH KEEPS TRACK OF SATELLITES ONCE THEY ARE LAUNCHED, SAID THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE LIGHTS, WHICH TRIGGERED A SMALL FLURRY OF FLYING SAUCER TALK.

THE FLAMING, COLORED LIGHTS WERE REPORTED BY AIRLINE PILOTS, AIR FORCE PILOTS, STATE POLICE AND CONTROL TOWERS.

THE AIR FORCE SAID AN OPERATOR IN THE AIRPORT CONTROL TOWER AT ROANOKE, VA., REPORTED WITNESSING THE OBJECT BREAK INTO THREE PIECES.

THE LIGHTS, MOVING GENERALLY IN A BROAD ARC FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST, MISSILEMEN AT CAPE CANAVERAL SAID THE LIGHTS, THROUGH BINOCULARS, APPEARED TO BE FAST-MOVING BALLS OF A MOLTEN SUBSTANCE.

PERHAPS BERLIN, FALLING APART.

A WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., MAN REPORTED SPOTTING A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY TWO SMALLER LIGHTS AND ANOTHER SMALL LIGHT SOME DISTANCE BEHIND.

AN AIR CONTROLLER AT THE RALEIGH-DURHAM, N.C., AIRPORT SAID THE LIGHTS WERE VISIBLE AT AN EXTREMELY HIGH ALTITUDE FOR ABOUT 2-1/2 MINUTES AND APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A STEADY FORMATION.

"THEY WERE LIKE A FORMATION OF JETS WITH AFTERBURNERS ON," HE SAID. "THEY LEFT A VAPOR TRAIL SIMILAR TO THAT OF JET AIRCRAFT."

THE U.S. WEATHER BUREAU IN RALEIGH SAID IT ALSO RECEIVED A NUMBER OF CALLS DESCRIBING THE LIGHTS. "IT WASN'T A COMET," A SPOKESMAN SAID, "BECAUSE A COMET DOESN'T MOVE THAT FAST."
