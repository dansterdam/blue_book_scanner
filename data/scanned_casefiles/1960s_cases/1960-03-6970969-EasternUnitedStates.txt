The text in the document is as follows:

AFOIR-H-22
SUBJECT: UFO Report

1. The objects seen on the evening of 7 March 1950, have been determined to be the remnants of disorganized VIFF satellite, its apparent higher rate of brilliancy over Florida.

2. There seems to be the possibility that we re-entry of the above satellite pattern as witnessed, since the time of sighting is very close to the computed time of disengagement of the objects reported by other witnesses.

Text extracted from the document:

Gentlemen:

This is for the purpose of reporting the sighting of what we saw on March 27, 1960, at approximately 10:00 P.M., in the vicinity of Little Silver, N.J. This is a report from myself and my wife.

On the evening of March 27, 1960, at approximately 10:00 P.M., my wife and myself were on our way home from visiting friends in Asbury Park, N.J. The object appeared midway between Polaris and Cassiopeia and appeared to be silver in nature as it moved in a circular motion for about 30 minutes. The course was generally southerly, so that we viewed it from right to left. The speed seemed very slow and seemed to be at an elevation of approximately 70 degrees from horizontal.

All appeared to be travelling exactly the same course and speed. The course was generally southerly, so that we viewed it from right to left. The speed seemed very slow and seemed to be at an elevation of approximately 70 degrees from horizontal. Whatever it was, it appeared to be climbing very slowly. They were what I would guess to be approximately 15 to 100 miles away from us and no sound relative to this at all.

Several curious after-affects of initial observation, having satisfied myself that they were not a constellation and that they were moving. I called my neighbor's attention to them. He confirmed my observation, and I then called my wife to come up and see and they were. We did not notice at this time any other aircraft in the area. The thing seemed to lower itself to the 7 and vanished after another 5 sec.

There is no photograph or image present in the provided document. The document appears to be a typed letter or report.

All the text found in the document is as follows:

"All the objects had about the same colors, a light orange-ish hue, roughly the same size, and were traveling at a high speed from North to South. Their brightness was approximately, that brightness was halfway between extremely bright and extremely dim.

I have been wondering if these might have been jet planes with afterburners on, but the formation seemed a little unusual for this, and if they were they must have been much closer than my guess and should have been more distinct. I would be most interested in knowing whether you have had any other reports of this particular incident."

Yours very truly,
[Signature redacted]

Gentleman:

This is for the purpose of getting the attention of a scientist who is interested in the cause of unidentified flying objects. In the evening of March 9, 1960 at 8:20 P.M. my wife and I observed a silver gray colored object moving in the sky at an altitude of about 1,500 to 2,000 feet. It was triangular in shape, approximately 20'-18' in size. It was moving at a high rate of speed in a straight line from the east toward the west. There was no sound emitted from the object. As it was passing overhead, it appeared to be spinning or rotating very rapidly on its own axis. The object disappeared in the western sky.

The only equipment we possess that might be of interest to G.I. Trainor would be a tape recorder and copy paper. On the tape you will find a recording of the voices of my wife and myself discussing the object immediately after the sighting. We do not claim to be experts on this subject but would be pleased to cooperate in any way that might assist in the investigation of this phenomenon.

Text extracted from the document:

This was why Downey guess to Smyrna for some, which could have been anything from 13 to 160 miles. The basis of our sound direction to site was probably erroneous.

About 2:30, my initial observation, lasting about 10 seconds, showed the object to be elongated and bright, apparently traveling very high and at great speed. In my opinion it was not a conventional aircraft, meteor or satellite. The object was not accompanied by any sound. I could see no wings, flames, or exhaust.

Mr. Brown P. Whit is now observing and advises that he can detect no visible distinguishing features. On this interval, 6:40 The T-34 had started a climb, and CFEDCA, taking control, joined on the target. Mr. Brown P. Whit observes that the object remains on the same heading but appears to be considerably lower.

All the planes had the same vector, Egon converge: his, a mighty one 9:10 descent from cloud to 5,000. And Singleton, who for B whisk was invisible, Coghill. Than Zsl then. Given consequently, that Singleton was interfering between Singleton and Shimada was more image than the former.  

Please confirm the name of the observer as "Brown P. Whit"

Washington D. C.

SITE:

At 0050 the evening, I sighted a strange object flying at about 10,000 feet. The object was moving in a southeast to northwest direction.

This object was colored a person or white, and gave off no apparent light. As it passed, either conventional or jet, would have made some sound.
This object had no apparent red or green running lights. Only the constant red or green running lights.

The circumstances for this sighting are as follows: I was walking in a northerly direction from the college when this object came into my view. It moved at a speed more than fifteen to twenty seconds.

Any additional information on this object will be sent to you or reported.

On April 3, 1960 about 2010A while eastlin in 13 Sandford st. I observed a saucer shaped object hovering about 250 ft. above the ground. The object was approximately 30 ft. in diameter, gray in color with a raised center. It appeared to be tilted at an angle. The object remained stationary for a few minutes then moved off rapidly to the east. As it moved, a blue flame seemed to come from the rear of the object and it was gone in a matter of a few seconds. The object was seen by myself and Godfrey P. Blount.

ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATED DURATION WHEN FIRST SIGHTED COMPARED TO AZIMUTH UPON DISAPPEARANCE WOULD INDICATE MOVEMENT FROM EAST TO WEST OBSERVER WAS NOT POSITIVE OF THESE FIGURES, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EXTREMELY SHORT TIME THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED.

UPI A1637 A1 
URGENT
CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA, MARCH 7 --(UPI)--A MYSTERIOUS FORMATION OF FLAMING LIGHTS, TRAVELING IN A STRANGE PATTERN, WAS SPOTTED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES TONIGHT. 
TOUCHING OFF AN AIR FORCE INVESTIGATION AND SPECULATION THAT IT MIGHT BE CONNECTED WITH A SATELLITE LAUNCHING. 
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE LIGHTS WERE FIRST SPOTTED OVER NORTH GEORGIA ABOUT 8:15 P.M. EST. 
THE NATIONAL SPACE AGENCY IN WASHINGTON CONFIRMED THAT NO SATELLITES WERE LAUNCHED FROM CAPE CANAVERAL TONIGHT.
BUT NASA AUTHORITIES SAID THAT THE INDICATIONS WERE THAT THE LIGHTS WERE OF NATURAL, NOT MAN-MADE, ORIGIN.
LABORATORIES AT CAPE CANAVERAL SAID THEY COULD OFFER NO EXPLANATION FOR THE LIGHTS, WHICH TRIGGERED A SMALL FLURRY OF TELEPHONING BETWEEN MILITARY AND CIVILIAN OFFICIALS.
THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE ARE INVESTIGATING," A SPOKESMAN SAID.
AN OFFICIAL AT CAPE CANAVERAL TOLD UPI THE LIGHTS WERE SIGHTED BY SEVERAL PERSONS AND APPARENTLY MOVED IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION AT A RAPID PACE.
IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND AT COLUMBUS, GA., WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING THE BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE SKY.
THE LIGHTS MADE NO SOUND AND LEFT NO VAPOR TRAIL, ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS. THE PIECES OF LIGHT APPEARED AS BRIGHT AS BURNING MAGNESIUM AND WERE OBSERVED CURVING GRACEFULLY TO THE HORIZON DUE EAST.
THE LIGHTS STARTED AS A CLOSELY-COLLECTED MASS OF FLAMING COLORED OBJECTS-POSSIBLY THEN SPREAD OUT AS THEY SHOT THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST. 
OF A SUDDEN, THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE FAST-MOVING BALLS SHOOTING ACROSS THE SKY, TRAILING FLAMES BEHIND THEM. AFTER ABOUT THREE MINUTES, THE DISPLAY FADED INTO BLACKNESS.
SEVERAL MINUTES LATER, THE LIGHTS REAPPEARED, TRAVELING OVER THE CAPE CANAVERAL AREA.
BUT ITS LIGHT WAS A BRILLIANT GREEN WITH A BLUISH TINGE. IT IS DESCRIBED AS RAPID AND BRILLIANT.
THIS OBJECT LEFT A VAPOR TRAIL, FAINTLY VISIBLE THROUGH BINOCULARS, AND IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY.
MANY MISSILES LAUNCHED AT CAPE CANAVERAL AT NIGHT USUALLY SPORT LIGHTS ARE ACCURATELY TRACKED BY STATIONS ON THE GROUND.

Agencies in Disagreement
On Mystery Lights
This case illustrates the disagreement that can exist between various agencies and scientific groups concerning the interpretation of unidentified flying objects or "mystery lights". 
A report was received from observers in a aircraft over the eastern United States. The observers reported seeing an intense lighted object at 30,000 feet altitude apparently hovering in the air motionless for approximately 20 minutes. The object was described as being about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and emitting a bright glowing light. After the initial 20 minute period, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight at a very high rate of speed.
The report was forwarded to the U.S. Air Force who investigated the incident. The Air Force concluded that the object was a meteor or bolide (fireball), even though the object was reported to be hovering motionless for an extended period of time. This interpretation was apparently based on the intense light and sudden acceleration and disappearance of the object.
However, certain astronomical groups disagreed with the Air Force interpretation. These groups felt that the observed behavior - a motionless hovering for 20 minutes - was not characteristic of a meteor or fireball, and that the observations indicated the presence of some type of structured, intelligently controlled aircraft.
This illustrates the type of disagreement that can arise between various agencies and scientific groups concerning the interpretation of unusual aerial phenomena. Reasonable people can disagree on the explanation of a particular sighting, especially when the reported behavior does not fit neatly into any conventional category of explanation.
March 1960

Agencies:
(At least two different agencies or scientific groups were involved in the investigation and interpretation of this sighting. The text does not provide the specific names of the agencies, only that there was disagreement between them.)

UFO SIGHTING
EASTERN UNITED STATES 
7 March 1960

On 7 March 1960 between the hours of 2010 and 2027 witnesses along the east coast of the United States from Florida to Ohioio, reported sighting an unidentified flying object. The object was described as a brilliant white light traveling from east to west as far west as Ohio, reported sighting an unidentified flying object. The object was described as a brilliant white light traveling from east to west as far west as Ohio. The object was reported to have traveled in a steady course and manner and to have bast a sharpe like an ice cream cone. The object was reported as a very brilliant white light trailing a luminous green haze or smoke, generally in a broad area. The object appeared to have a burst of speed and to move from the northwest to the southeast at a high altitude approximately 5,000 feet. The display was reported to be the decay and re-entry of satellite 1959 Lambda. (Discovery VIII).

UFO SIGHTING OVER CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA., MARCH 8 - (UNITED PRESS) - AIR FORCE OFFICIALS TODAY REPORTED A STRANGE OBJECT FLASHED ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES LAST NIGHT. 
THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED FROM CAPE CANAVERAL SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN CONTROL TOWER LIGHTS WERE SEEN AS THE OBJECT FLASHED ACROSS THE SKIES, FAR BRIGHTER THAN ANY STAR OR PLANET.
AIR FORCE OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON SAID THE LIGHTS WERE BELIEVED TO BE A METEOR WHICH BROKE UP IN MID-AIR, OFFICIALS SAY THE LIGHTS DEFINITELY DID NOT COME FROM ANY AIR FORCE MISSILES OR AIRCRAFT LAUNCHED AT CAPE CANAVERAL.
THE LIGHTS "DEFINITEL DID NOT COME" FROM A MISSILE OR AIRCRAFT BEING TESTED AT THE CAPE, OFFICIALS SAID. THEY SAID THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE MOVING VERY RAPIDLY AND THEN BROKE UP INTO SEVERAL SMALLER PARTICLES.
ONE OFFICIAL SAID THE LIGHTS LOOKED LIKE A VERY BRIGHT GAS POCKET OR ROCKET THAT TOOK PICTURES. MILITARY OFFICIALS HERE BELIEVE IT WAS MOST PROBABLY A METEOR OR PART OF A SATELLITE BREAKING UP.
HOWEVER, OFFICIALS AT THE SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY SAID THEIR CAMERAS AND INSTRUMENTS PICKED UP NO METEOR SHOWER OR ANY UNUSUAL ACTIVITY OVER CAPE CANAVERAL LAST NIGHT. 
THE MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS WHICH INTRIGUED MANY IN FLORIDA WERE SEEN BY AIR FORCE PILOTS AND CONTROL TOWERS AND THE REPORT CONTROL TOWER AT ROANOKE, VA. ALSO REPORTED SEEING SIMILAR LIGHTS ABOUT THE SAME TIME.
BINOCULARS APPEARED TO SHOW A VERY FAST-MOVING BALL OF A MOLTEN SUBSTANCE,
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.- MAN REPORTED SPOTTING A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT FOLLOWING CLOSELY BEHIND SEVERAL LIGHTS IN THE SKY. 
AN AIR CONTROLLER AT THE RALEIGH-DURHAM, N.C.AIRPORT SAID THE LIGHTS MOVED RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY AND APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A STEADY FORMATION.
THE U.S. WEATHER BUREAU IN RALEIGH SAID IT ALSO RECEIVED A NUMBER OF CALLS DESCRIBING THE LIGHTS. IT WASN'T A COMET, THE BUREAU SAID, "BECAUSE A COMET DOESN'T MOVE THAT FAST."

Following is an extract from ATIC Duty Officers Report, Captain C. L. Moore, Jr.
report dated 7 March 1960 for your information:

2110 - Read call from Cape Billy DULA, Mass Flight Services, X-31107,
giving consolidated report of 18 UFO reports. Reports ranged
from Gleemland, Ohio to Round Prairie, Missouri, with the usual
variety, i.e. 0307 to 0112. Cape DULA will submit a full
report.

2145 - Read call from Major Sisemore, AF Comd Post, requesting confirmation
of above report. Confirmation to Major Sisemore.

2250 - Major Friend advised of above condition. His initial reaction
was "IA negative".

2230 - Due to public increase in UFO reports, Majors Redbal and Sisemore
(AF Command Post) called to establish a telcon between myself, 
Captain Jewell, Jr. (ATIC) and Themselves. After all facts were
discussed, it was decided that no further action (besides reporting)
was required. Initial indications, without definite evidence of investigation, were "vehicle break-up".

All requests for information will be referred to Major Walker.
Additional info at ATIC 4-2211. Action completed at 2305 hours.
