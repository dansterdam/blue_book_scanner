SADDLE BUNCH SHORES
KEY WEST, FLA.
JULY 18 . 1963

N.A.S.A.
WASHINGTON ,D.C.

SIRS:

WHAT I AM REPORTING MAY OR MAY NOT BE OF INTEREST TO YOUR OFFICE, NEVERTHELESS I AM MAKING THIS REPORT.

ON NIGHT OF 18 JULY 1963 FROM MY HOME ON SADDLE BUNCH KEY, NEAR KEY WEST I OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A PLANE APPROACHING FROM ALMOST DUE NORTH DIRECTION, UPON CLOSER EXAMINATION I NOTICED THERE WAS NO BLINKING LIGHTS OR RUNNING LIGHTS ALTHOUGH THIS OBJECT WAS LIKE AN OBLONG OBJECT LOOKING LIKE IT WAS QUITE HOT AND A FEW SECONDS LATER IT COMPLETELY BURNED AND TURNED TO A WHITISH CLOUD OF SMOKE, PROBABLY DUE TO ALTITUDE AND THE SUNS RAYS BEING ON THE CLOUD. THIS WAS AT 8:20 PM EST ON JULY 18,1963 THIS CLOUD REMAINED VISIBLE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER THE BURNING AND ALL LIGHTS OR FIRE HAD DISAPPEARED.

THE SPEED OF THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT LIKE THE BALLOON THAT WAS VISIBLE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AND LOOKED VERY MUCH AS IT DID WHEN THE SUNS RAYS WAS ON IT AT NIGHT ON ITS WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I HAVE NO IDEA OF APPROX. DISTANCE FROM ME OR THIS OBJECT REPORTED BUT AM QUITE SURE IT WAS AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM MY LOCATION HERE 10 MILES I.E. OR YES.

ANOTHER THING I NOTICED ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE OF IMPORTANCE WHEN IT BURNED AND TURNED WHITE SMOKE, A SMOKE CURL TRAVELED BEYOND AND UPWARD FROM THE MAIN CLOUD IN SUCH MANNER AS TO SEEM TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED AND PIECES STILL SMOKING TRAVELED FORWARD AND UPWARD FROM THE MAIN CLOUD.

IT WAS DARKNESS HERE AT THE TIME AND I FEEL THAT SUNS RAYS WAS ON THE CLOUD OR OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER THE BURNING. THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT IT WAS SOMETHING NOT TOO FAR FROM THE EARTH ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE.

IF THIS WAS AS INDICATED A SATELLITE OR SOME OTHER SPACE VEHICLE AND IT WAS AT THE DISTANCE IT APPEARED TO BE I SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED OVER ALABAMA OR MISSISSIPPI IN THAT AREA.

P/S I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS TO BE A FALLING STAR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING ALMOST HORIZONTAL WITH THE EARTH THEN IT BURNED.

THANK YOU
