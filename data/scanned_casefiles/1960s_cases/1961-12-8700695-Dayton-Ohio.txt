Witnesses stated obj. was almost stationary window is on a side, this too would indicate that obj. is a star set for Dayton area at time witness reported, that obj. disappeared, Sirius star (apparent) in SW heavens, and due to this being just before it passed below horizon, star was probably distant.

11. COMMENTS was probably bright star Sirius at 220°, but this was probably closer to 270°. Witness stated how obj. appeared, due W. Base of witnesses faces E and N. Sirius is in SW sky. Comparing notes with star set for Dayton area at time witnesses reported, star (apparent) in SW heavens, and due to this being just before it passed below horizon, star was probably bright star Sirius.

THE WITNESSES PLACED THE OBJECT DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR DRAWING OF HOW THE OBJECT APPEARED, THIS WOULD TEND TO INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT WAS ALMOST DUE WEST. THE HOME OF THE WITNESSES FACES EAST AND THE BATHROOM WINDOW IS ON THE WEST SIDE, THIS TOO WOULD INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT IS WEST. THE STAR.

ASTRONOMY
Science News Letter for November 25, 1961

Impressive Stellar Display
Brilliant winter constellations shining on December evenings include Orion, Canis Major and Taurus. The planets Jupiter and Saturn are visible early, James Stokley reports.

> WITH THE ARRIVAL of December the brilliant constellations of the winter evenings are now in full view. Orion and his neighbors, which occupy a region of the sky that has more bright stars than any other area of similar size, shine in the southeast, as shown on the accompanying maps. These depict the heavens as they look about 10 p.m., your own kind of standard time, at the first of December, and earlier at the middle of the month and two hours earlier at the end.

A good place to start is with three stars in a row from the warrior's vertical that form the belt of the warrior, which is the way that Orion was pictured on the old star maps. These stars are high in the southeast. To the left, and a little higher, is Betelgeuse, while brilliant Rigel is to the right and below the belt.

Directly below Orion is Lepus, the hare, a relatively faint group, but to the left of this creature is Canis Major, the great dog, with the star called Sirius. It is also known as the dog star, and is the brightest star that we can see in the nighttime sky. Even though its present low altitude causes considerable reduction in its light on account of absorption in the atmosphere, Sirius still shines with great splendor.

Canis Minor Stands in the East
Over toward the east, a little higher than Sirius, is Procyon in Canis Minor, the little dog. And above this group is the constellation of Gemini, the twins, in which are two bright stars, Castor and Pollux. (These appear on the map of the northern sky.)

Above Orion is Taurus, the bull, with the bright star Aldebaran (red in color) marking the animal's eye. To the left of Taurus (also on the northern sky map) is Auriga, the charioteer, with Capella as the brightest star.

Low in the northwest is Vega, about all that is now visible of the constellation of Lyra, the lyre. Vega is of the first magnitude, brightest star in its own altitude, but causes a diminution of its light, as with Sirius. Similarly dimmed is Deneb, in Cygnus, the swan, which is above Vega.

Directly north, about halfway between the two stars, is Polaris, the pole star, which is part of Ursa Minor, the little bear. (Ursa Major, the big bear, is a little lower and to the right, in a poor position.)

It is always is at this time of year. But according to mythology, is above her mother. Directly overhead stands Perseus, the champion, who rescued the princess

[Continued on next column]

Southern Hemisphere it is the beginning of summer.

On Dec. 21, as seen from the U.S., the sun rises far to the south of the eastern point of the horizon. Similarly, it sets well to the south of the west. Its noon-day height is the lowest of the year. Consequently it has only a short path above the horizon, and a long one below, which means that this is the shortest day of the year, and the longest night.

Knowing this, you might suppose that on the 21st the sun would rise later than any other day, and set earlier. But it does not!

The earliest sunset comes from Nov. 30 to Dec. 13. Then, at 40 degrees north latitude, it sets at 4:35 p.m. If you are on the central meridian of your time zone. (That is, at 75 degrees west longitude for Eastern time, 90 degrees for Central, 105 degrees for Mountain) and 120 degrees for Pacific.) To the west of these meridians, by your watch, it would be later, to the east, earlier. On Dec. 21, the sun sets at 4:38 p.m., and rises at 7:13 a.m.

The latest rising, at 7:22 a.m., comes from Dec. 30 to Jan. 11, when the sun sets from 4:43 p.m. to 4:55 p.m. In other words, the earliest sunsets come several days before the solstice, while the latest sunrises come several days later. Why?

The reason lies in the fact that the sun is not entirely satisfactory as a clock. Centuries ago, the sundial was the most common timepiece. Noon came when the sun was directly south, with the shadow of the gnomon aimed due north.

The document also contains two star charts showing the night sky for December, with constellation and star positions marked.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

sometimes runs fast, sometimes slow, because of the way the earth revolves around the sun. It indicates what is called apparent time. As clocks came into use, "mean" time was introduced, which is based on an average, or mean sun, that does not run at the same rate throughout the year.

At the beginning of November, mean time is about 15 minutes slow compared to apparent time; that is, the sun is 15 minutes early. After that—during December—the clock gains rapidly on the sundial. In mid-February, the sun will be almost 15 minutes late. The difference between mean and apparent time is called the "equation of time"; it is the number of minutes and seconds that you must add to or subtract from the mean time indicated by the clock to get the corresponding point or sundial time.

On Dec. 6, approximately midway in the earliest sunset period, the equation of time is plus 9 minutes 11 seconds; on Dec. 21, plus 2 minutes 10 seconds, and on Jan. 5, approximately midway in the later sunrise period, minus 5 minutes 6 seconds. Now let us alter the times of sunrise and sunset on these dates to give it in apparent and we have:

Sunset           Sunrise
Dec. 6   4:44 p.m.   7:16 a.m.
21       4:40 p.m.   7:20 a.m.
Jan. 5   4:44 p.m.   7:17 a.m.

Now the latest sunrise and the earliest sunset do occur on the shortest day—the day with the least time between the sun's rising and setting.

In other words, the sun performs according to its own kind of time, not the arbitrary and artificial kind of time that man has found most convenient to regulate his activities.

December 27 Springfield, Ohio 10:45 p.m. Carol 3. Bennett and bar mother observed a reddish-glowing object across the sky. After the UFO stopped, they contacted Atlas Bennett with a 15-power telescope. Although still appearing red in the middle, the UFO looked like a steel gray ball through the telescope; one side was dark gray, the other light. After 4 more detailed reports were received.

3 Dec 61
Sacramento, Calif

Here's an unusual item from Sacramento, California, dated December 9th, 1961. A matter Air Force Base jet claimed a "blinding flash", believed to be a large network over northern California. A jet on the night of December 9th. The flashing object finally "apparently" dived into the Pacific Ocean. Sacramento area law enforcement officials and residents had reported a "bright ball", big as the object checked.

Missile, Contrail or UFO? NJ
From Weatherville, and Eureka, California, from Burns, Oregon and Reno, Nevada came reports on 6 December 1961, of the observation of a westerly moving craft with a "tail" twice as long as itself. The object was officially explained as (1) a Thor missile launched from Vandenburg and (2) a vapor trail from a high altitude, high performance craft known to be flying in the area.

Take your pick.
