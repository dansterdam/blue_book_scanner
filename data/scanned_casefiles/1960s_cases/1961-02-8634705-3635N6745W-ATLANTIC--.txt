Unusual radar track. Large blip as compared to regular signal returns. Speed of obj estimated about 4500 knots, 3 points of radar. Appeared 270° magnetic heading (azimuth). Disappeared 270° magnetic heading. Slight arc. Faded to W.

11. COMMENTS
Obj was observed for 1-3 min on radar, with no visual sighting made. Speed of objt was reported to be 4500 knots. Obj was apparently seen on a mag heading of 270, and it disappeared on this same heading. What elevation was upon appearing and disappearing was not reported. In view of absence of pertinent info, this report is evaluated as Insufficient Data.

Memo (AFCIN-48), 19 Apr 61, Request for Review
1st Ind (AFCIN-415a/Mr. Bryant/je/76201)                                   9 May 61

TO:   AFCIN-4M (Maj Friend)

1.   The report dated 14 Apr 61 from Anderson AFB has insufficient information with to base an evaluation. For example, "Description of flight path and maneuvers of object" is indicated as "N/A", and range of the target is not given.

2.   Report dated 17 Feb 61 has been evaluated and evaluation indicates the possibility of unidentified body (or unusual) in the area. The only possibility is that target was real. The abnormally large size of the object, its no set pattern of movement, and lack of conclusive information are other possibilities. Recommend further investigation of equipment agencies to determine if mystery body or meteorite was real.

3.   Evaluation of report from 664th AGC Sq., Tues., Aris., dated 28 Feb 61, indicates staff drop is most plausible explanation. Check of Air Force activities for possible cause could be made.
