FLYING SAUCER REVIEW

Southampton, England

Southampton again
From the Southern Evening Echo of
December 4, 1965, we read how Mrs.
Wendy Poulton, a bank clerk watched
an object from her bedroom window
on the evening of the 1st. She said:
"The first time I saw it was
when it moved across the sky from the
direction of the docks," she says.
"Now, apparently, the object has
been around for a few days. It is a
ball-shaped object with a brilliant
glowing centre. Wendy and her
father, Mr. P. J. Poulton, who runs a
hairdresser and fruiter business,
have looked at it through powerful
binoculars."
"It appears as soon as it gets dark
and is brighter than all the stars. It is
oval in shape and seems to have two
glowing ends," says Wendy.
"Mr. Poulton sees it as a brilliant,
firework sparkler. It moves around:
last night it was over the Civic
Centre."

The image does not contain a photograph, only text. I will now proceed to extract the text from the document using optical character recognition (OCR):

Near Tucuman, Argentina, a UFO landed in an alfalfa field on December 8th, and was seen by many people, including Cecilio Lopez. The former investigator of the site the morning after, according to Saucer News, described the object as "a silvery craft", and said that in Spanish it is called a "OVNIS", apparently meaning the Spanish word for "unidentified flying object". The object is estimated to be about 40 feet in diameter.

Finally, according to the English-language Buenos Aires Herald of November 5th, a father according to the article, Director of the San Miguel Observatory, has clearly visible UFOs in photographs taken of his little Echo II.
On another occasion recently, he saw a UFO closely following the little Echo II.

SUBJECT: Washington, D. C. 20390

Gentlemen:

In a recent newspaper article, I read where to write to you about U.F.O. sightings. By sightings we several months ago, and I had forgotten about it until I started reading recent reports on this.

My report goes as follows:

On the night of January 10, 1965, a Friday, I went to Beckley, West Virginia, to spend the weekend at our campsite along with my father. That night, I went to the city of Lewisburg about 22 miles from our camp.

It was about 11:00 P.M. and I was traveling in a northeast direction around Lewisburg. The Lewisburg the city of Lewisburg and Clintonville. About 1 mile out of Ronceverte, I crossed a large hill which seemed to be the main valley which I then valley which is surrounded on all sides by orange trees.

When I looked off to my left, I could see Lake Wiggins. It was many times bigger than the base of the hill where the valley meets the lake. There was a disk of a silvery color. It appeared to be driven at an altitude of 50 to 60 feet, hovering about 50 feet off the ground. I observed the same area and there was no object which has appeared before.

I know that this is a long time afterwards to report my sight, but if you could help solve my mystery, I would deeply appreciate it.

Thanking you in advance.

The text in the document is as follows:

Information Only
Sources: Saucer News, Vol 13, #1, Mar 66

On the night of December 10th, three women who would not allow papers to release their names, saw a UFO over their automobile on a road between Nazareth and Hanover Township, Pa. They described it as round and circular, with a dull glow around its base, floating about 6 to 10 yards above the vehicle. It shot upwards and went out of sight. The investigators with the car's motor. (Allentown, Pa. Sunday Call 12/25/55.)

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a document or report related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text at the top of the image indicates this is from the "Saucer News" publication, Volume 13, #1, dated March 1966.

The text in the document appears to be a report stating that three sightings of a radar target from a ship off the coast were so bright that they could be read by the observers on board the ship.

Finally, a Rautars report dated December 13th states that three sightings of a radar target from a ship off the coast of Timbuktu were so bright that they could be read by it.
