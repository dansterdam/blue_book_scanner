FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
Jan-Feb 66

1 DEC 65
Southampton, England

Southampton again
From the Southampton Evening Echo of
December 4, 1963, we read how Miss
Wendy Boulton, a bank clerk watched
an object from her bedroom window
on the evening of the 1st, 2nd, and
3rd December. The report continues: "The first time I saw it was
when it rushed across the sky from the
direction of the docks," she says.

"Now, apparently, the object has
taken up station roughly over Thornhill housing estate. Wendy and her
father, Mr. F. J. Boulton, who runs a
fishmonger and fruiterer business,
have looked at it through powerful
binoculars.

"It appears as soon as it gets dark
and is brighter than all the stars. It is
oval in shape and seems to have five
sticking out," says Wendy.

"Mr. Boulton sees it a 'rather like a
firework sparkler'. It moves around;
last night it was over the Civic
Centre."

Tucuman, Argentina
4 December 1965

Near Tucuman, Argentina, a UFO landed in an alfalfa field on the night of December 4th, and was seen by many people, including Antonio Lozano and Cecilio Lopez. The former investigated the site the next morning. He found a burned circle, and a piece of paper with the message "CHIVNROSS" on it. This apparently means a little in Spanish as does in English. The paper was left with scientists at Tucuman University for further study.

Finally, according to the English-language Buenos Aires Herald of December 5th, Father Segundo Benito Reyna, Director of the San Miguel Observatory in Argentina, has found clearly-visible UFOs in photographs taken of the moon. On another occasion recently, he saw a UFO closely following the U. S. satellite Echo 11.

Gentlemen:

In a recent newspaper article, I read where to write you about my U.F.O. sighting. My sighting was several months ago, and I had all but forgotten about it until I started reading recent reports on them.

My report goes as follows:

On the night of December 10, 1965, a Friday, I went to Ocala National Forest to spend the weekend at our campsite along with my father-in-law. That night, I went to the City of Leesburg about 22 miles from our camp to visit some friends of mine. Upon my return trip to our camp is when I saw what I would say to be an U.F.O.

It was about 11:00 P.M. and I was traveling in a northeast direction around Lake Weir between the towns of Weirsdale and Oklawaha on Alt. 441. About 1 mile out of Weirsdale, I crossed a large hill which descends into a deep valley which is surrounded on all sides by orange trees.

When I looked off to my left, I could see Lake Weir, a sight which I had seen many times before. But this time, I also saw something else. At the base of the hill where the valley meets the lake, there was a large, oval disk of a silvery color. It was driving at about 60 m.p.h., and I slowed to about 35 m.p.h. In order to get a better look. I would say the object was about ¼ of a mile from the highway, hovering about 50 to 100 feet off the ground. I observed no lights from the object but could clearly see its base come from about 100 feet. From this distance, I would say it was approximately 90 feet in diameter and nearly 20 feet thick. I did not stop my car for a closer look at the time, but the next day on another trip to Leesburg, I observed the same area and there was no object which looked like the thing I had seen the night before.

I know that this is a long time afterwards to report my sighting but if you could help solve my mystery, I could deeply appreciate it.

Thanking you in advance,

[Signature redacted]

Nazareth & Hanover Township, Pa.
10 December 1965

On the night of December 10th, three women who would not allow the newspapers to release their names, saw a UFO over their automobile on a road between Nazareth and Hanover Township, Pa. They described it as a round object with a dome about 20 lights on the rim, and with a big blinking light in the center. After hovering in a tilted position for a few seconds, just a few yards above the vehicle, it shot upward and went out of sight. There was no interference with the car's motor. (Allentown, Pa. Sunday Call-Chronicle, 12/25/55)....

Peru to Tahiti
13 December 65

Finally, a Reuters report dated December 13th states that three members of a raft expedition from Peru to Tahiti told reporters that, while they drifted alone in the open sea, a UFO approached their raft one night and gave off so much light that they could read by it.
