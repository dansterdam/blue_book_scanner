To Whom this may Concern;

In the evening of Jan 9, 1961, George Patty and myself were dining to eat dinner. In the distance I spotted a small white streak in the far distance. Realizing that we were not observing a jet trail, we stop and watched this object for 20 mins - The streak did not get smaller or move, but remained the same height.

After 10 mins, it started moving vertically and somewhat horizontally and moved in that position for few mins.

When we got to the house, which took about 3 mins.

We could still see the object
still horizontal, moving slightly
toward the West, were slightly
Southwest until it went out
of vision - this took 15 min's
and was only a speck like
a star. We showed several
people, passer-bys the object
and they also watched.
Enclosed is a rough drawing
of what we saw. I called
the newspaper later on to see if
anyone had called in, but they
didn't seem interested so as
my civic duty I thought I had
better send this information to
you. I am a registered nurse and
was away from the hosp. for
supper when we saw this (over)

I would have called the observatory at the University, but I just had 30 min off and had to report back to the Hosp. and was late.

I hope what ever information I give you my helping some way-- because it is Associate and three people can teach me up.

Thanking you,

Campbellsville, Ky.
