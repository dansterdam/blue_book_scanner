Dear Sirs:

This is what I saw the other nite while driving home. The nite was very clear. There were out only a few small clouds. When I saw this it was very low and traveling slowly. I could see something very clearly. I stopped beside of the road and watched it move around in the sky for over 15 minutes. Then it looked like it landed in a wooded area. I waited outside for it to rise into view again. But nothing happened.


- page 3 -

So I started my car and continued to drive on home. I did not see the object again that nite.

Once before I saw an object in the sky that looked like this one. But the weather was slightly misty + foggy + I was not sure. But this time I saw it very clearly.

Sincerely yours,
[Name redacted]

Contact was made with Goodyear Corp. Akron, Ohio with a Mr. [redacted]. The Goodyear blimp was in the Louisville Kentucky area on 9 Sept. 66, thus could not account for the observation. The blimp has an advertising sign that measures 100 feet long and 14 feet high attached to the side of the craft. There are four lights that comprise the sign. The blimp flies in various parts of the country from time to time and uses the sign for various advertising.

It was between 9 and 10 P.M. of 4-nology Evening. I was looking south. I had my Dog with me + had stopped (beside the Road) a moment before to let my Dog out to Relieve himself. I was just beginning to start the car into motion, when out of the Corner of Right Eye, I saw something. I turned my head of Juncal to the west and in the Distance saw Flashing Lites, at first it thought it was a plane. But as it Come Closer, and the rate of at Traveled. I knew it once it was not a Plane. There were too many lites + Colors, and except for it being low, humming around there was no other sound. Now was there on or near the sound like from a Plane after it was Passed By. That's about all I can tell you about it, & expect that it made no attempt to Bugger or out-thing, like that, etc.

altho at one time it was a large | over
head about 4 or 500 feet in the air, and the
official had reduced to one almost instantaneous
moment for a few moments then turned
down, then south west & then south and disappeared
behind some trees. I noticed all the time
see if it would appear again. But it
did not. so I started my car & drove home.
I did not see it again, that nite, nor have
I seen it since. I have not told any
one around here about it. Except for the
letter I mailed to Washington, D.C. with a
description and drawing as I have given
to you in this form. If there is any thing
else you wish to know, Please let me know
altho I do not believe I can tell you any
more than I have now.
