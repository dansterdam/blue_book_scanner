The image contains a hand-drawn illustration of a UFO or unidentified flying object. The illustration shows a cross-section view of the object, labeled with various color designations for different parts, such as "YELLOW LITE", "RED GREEN LITES", and "GREEN LITES BLACK".

Below the illustration, there is a handwritten letter that appears to be describing the UFO sighting. The text mentions that the writer is enclosing a sketch of the object they witnessed, and provides some details about its appearance and behavior.

As an OCR system, the text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sirs,
This is what I saw the other nite wile returning home. The nite was very clear and I saw this object very clearly. It was oblong in shape and seemed to remain motionless for some time at a very low level and then suddenly shot up at terrific speed. I could not determine the exact shape or whether it had any markings on it due to the rapidity of its movement. 
It seemed to have a glow that lit up the area. I wanted to take another look but it was gone. But nothing has happened since.

Text transcription:

The object made a continued noice on the house. It did not see the object again that night.

Since before I went on the step I saw a object in the sky that looked about twice our house. But the weather was slightly misty at 9:50 PM and it did not see clearly.

Sincerely yours

Oct. 66
Contact was made with Goodyear Corp., Akron, Ohio, with a Mr. Jackson. The Goodyear blimp was in the Louisville, Kentucky area on 9 Sept 66, thus could not account for the observation. The blip that was observed on the radar screen could not be accounted for. There are four lights that comprise the sign. The blimpflies in various missions of the country from time to time and were the sign for various sightings.

The image contains a diagram or sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The diagram shows the object's shape, color, and other details, as described in the text of the document.

TRANSCRIBED TEXT:
14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It flatlanded, descended gradually, then disappeared with a slight rocking motion. It was very distinctly visible at first, then very gradually faded away.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
If answered YES, then tell what.
Don't know. My eyes did not scan the horizon and sky very thoroughly. I was concentrating intently on the object. I do not recall seeing it move behind any clouds or other objects.

16. Did the object at any time change in shape or color while you were watching it?
If you answered YES, then describe the changes.
Don't know. I really don't recall noting any changes in shape or color. I was so absorbed in observing the object that I'm afraid I can't give you any details on color or shape changes.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - There was no sound that I could detect.
b. Color -  The color from a distance seemed to be yellow, orange, or gold. It had a self-luminous quality, not merely reflecting light.
c. Size - I would estimate the size at 40 to 45 feet in length.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or coin's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object's width is covered by the length of the match. If you had compared the object's size at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match stick?
If the object was 40-45 feet long, I would estimate that the match stick would have covered about 1/3 to 1/4 of the object's length.

19. Can you furnish any additional data such as drawings, diagrams or pictures of the object? If so, please enclose or describe such material. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object such as wings, protrusions, etc., and also state the exact direction the object was moving and the date and time of the incident.
The diagram I've included shows the object as I recall seeing it. It was below treetop level and seemed to be moving very slowly in a horizontal direction, but I'm not sure of the exact course or direction. This sighting occurred on September 8, 1966.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing text and a form with various questions and checkboxes.

20. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object? (Circle One) Yes No. IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate? 500 to 600 M.P.H.
21. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was? (Circle One) Yes No. IF you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was? Flying very high up, not close to me at all. 
22. Where were you located when you saw the object? (Circle One) a. Inside a building b. In a car c. Outside d. an airplane (type) e. At sea f. Other
23. Were you (Circle One) a. In the business section of a city? b. In the residential section of a city? c. In open countryside? d. Near an airport? e. Flying over a city? f. Flying over open country? g. Other

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common scene or objects which, when placed up to the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you observed.

I cannot derive or produce any clear image of what was observed based on the textual description provided. However, the report contains detailed information about the sighting, including the witness's estimates of the object's speed and distance, its location relative to the observer, whether the witness was moving at the time, and the optical aids used to observe the object. The description indicates that the object was high in the sky, flying at a high speed, and appeared to the witness to be quite distant.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows a compass and an illustration of an object in the sky, with instructions on how to use the sketch to describe the sighting.

Outputting the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

I can't say for sure what I saw. It appeared a little like a star or planet but some things seemed different, like I had never seen anything quite like it before. There were some strange movements which I felt at the time could not be accounted for by any known astronomical object or aircraft. I reported this sighting to the air force and they were very interested in it. Their investigators came to my home and interviewed me in detail about what I had observed. They told me they felt the sighting had real merit and that they would investigate it further.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?  
The reporting of this sighting was made [Redacted] to the U.S. Air Force in Washington D.C.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. government program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 9-3-66

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
Various events took place south of here that night. I saw a strange blue light, about the size of a basketball, apparently hovering or floating a few feet above the ground. It hovered for a moment, then dropped out of sight behind some trees - I couldn't see it fall or move away. It was silent, and I didn't see it again. I went back the next morning to look around for it, but couldn't find any evidence of where it had been. There were no power lines or other objects near where I saw it. The only sound was a slight humming noise that seemed to come from near where the light had been hovering. I can't explain what it was, but it didn't seem like any ordinary light or object I've ever seen before. I thought you might be interested in this additional information.

CAUSE OF OUR STRANGE ELECTRICAL PHENOMENON WAS EVIDENTLY EXAMINED THRU COMPLETE MILITARY CHANNELS AND PROCEDURES FQR INVESTIGATION AND EVALUATION. 

REPORT OF THE UNUSUAL ACTIVITY WEST OF FRANKLIN SPRINGS, N.Y.

THE TYPE OF PHENOMENON WITNESSED WAS APPARENTLY OF THE SAME GENERAL NATURE AS HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY THIS STATION BEFORE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS. THE PHENOMENON CONSISTED OF AN INTENSE LUMINOUS ACTIVITY OBSERVED OVER A SPECIFIC AREA OF THE COUNTRYSIDE, ACCOMPANIED BY MARKED ELECTRICAL DISTURBANCES. VISUAL OBSERVATIONS BY MANY WITNESSES ESTABLISH THAT THE LUMINOSITY WAS OF GREAT INTENSITY, AREA COVERAGE,AND DURATION. ELECTRICAL EFFECTS ON RADIOS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT ALSO WERE NOTED. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OCCURRENCE WAS NOT WITHIN THE NORMAL REALM OF NATURAL ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA, NOR DID IT BEAR CHARACTERISTICS OF ANY KNOWN MILITARY OR EXPERIMENTAL ACTIVITIES IN THE AREA.
