34. Date you completed this questionnaire:                16    August    1963
                                                        Day     Month     Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

After the flying object had almost descended, it floated or sailed much faster than it had when first spotted. My daughter and I seem to almost stand still that this peculiar object had lost its strength and was lither seeking energy or trying to generate some; and was soon as it had passed over power lines. We do not know, then it was able to ascend and speed up. Tall other accounts where people were close there seem metal car with a car. Perhaps this object needed such an attraction the pattern might to gain the desired height and speed. It could not have been seen by anybody other than person living along our alley, until it received about the point which allowed it to rise above the other roof level, after it left our alley. When I looked at the clock after the object was out of sight it was 9:40 five minutes had passed. I then decided to see it.

Here is the text from the document:

This vapor had caused a reaction on the surrounding things. When I looked at the moon which was bright and full that night I didn't see a moon but a beautiful ornate cross with a light extending downward. There was a blaze of light behind it, but no more.

The lines of the cross were prominently the light was behind the cross and two bright-yellow. This lasted a while and then disappeared.

The moon was seen again but it seemed to be transparent and a much paled yellow than before. It didn't affect the stars. It was about a half-hour later before we saw any airplanes and they were flying very high and at a distance. The nearby fields reported no airplanes in route at the time we are called about the mysterious vapor.

There is also a hand-drawn sketch of a cross-like shape with radiating lines on the left side of the document.
