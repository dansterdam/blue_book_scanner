UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
PROJECT BLUE BOOK

SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14

The document appears to be a data table with multiple columns and rows, containing numerical data across different dates in April 1963. The header indicates this is part of a United States Air Force Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14. The text is dense with numerical values and appears to be a scientific or technical log of some kind, with dates ranging from April 16 to April 26, 1963. Due to the small font size and complex layout, specific individual values are difficult to read in detail without zooming in.
