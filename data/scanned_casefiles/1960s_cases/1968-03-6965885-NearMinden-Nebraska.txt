Gentlemen:

At approximately 10:40 P. M., Central Standard Time, my wife and I was driving one of our cars one-fourth mile ahead of me, and I was driving at approximately the same rate, over the Interste-80 Bridge ten miles north of Minden, and we both saw a green object very clearly. My daughter and I saw it through her rear view through my front window.

We continued driving south toward Minden, Nebraska, and at 10:49 P.M., one and one-half miles north of Minden, we saw another object, which appeared to be perhaps a plane with its landing lights on. As it got closer, it was not a plane. It was some separate objects, very bright, not hot light. They were eliptical in shape and as they came toward us, they suddenly went out. The very instant a red exhaust resembling a jet engine, came from the rear. It hung suspended in the air for perhaps two and half times longer than it took to disappear. Soon they emitted some kind of a loud noise, like a sharp pocket burst, they separated and disappeared.

At no time did we feel any heat or experience any difficulty with our car, or any of the other symptoms which we have read in other reports we do seal that something unusual took place at this particular time.

We think it might be connected with the green ball seen ten miles earlier over the Platte River near the Minden Inter-Change on State 30 and Highway, Nebraska, 10.

This is merely to report the sighting of these objects.

Cordially yours,
PAW/ak

This will reply to your letter of March 19, 1968. It appears that your description of the Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) that your family observed.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Such base has an investigator who is in a better position to make an on the spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate evaluation.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature to help you identify the sightings. Thank you for reporting this to the Air Force.

The image appears to be a page from an old document, but it does not contain any photographs. The text is a letter from the University of Pennsylvania, Flower and Cook Observatory, addressed to Colonel Quintanilla. The letter discusses an annual report for the year 1967, which was sent earlier. The letter is signed by Charles P. Oliver.

UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
Flower and Cook Observatory

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

Your letters of 27 September, 1968, which refer to our letter of 29 September, 1968, have been received. I do not have any information about a UFO sighting near Minden, Nebraska on 6 March 1968.

The Annual A.A.A.S. Report for 1967, which was sent earlier, was completely routine. Several circulars were also included, but they did not refer to any UFO sightings.

Sincerely yours,
Charles P. Oliver
