SUMMARY:
Complainant reported that at approximately 2040 hrs this date, he and the witness observed a flat oval shaped object about the size of a dime at arm's length with 15 degree angle to the west of his residence. The object was bright chrome with a brilliant red stripe across the center. Observance was constant. For 15-17 minutes, then the object disappeared by a gradual descent toward the ground. The complainant used a pair of 6 x 30 binoculars in sighting the object.

A check with the MCAFD Control Tower revealed no aircraft in the area, and that personnel in the tower had observed an exceptionally bright star, that could have been the same as the object observed.
