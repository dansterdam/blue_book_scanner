SUBJECT: UFO REPORT
ANALYST: MAJ QUINTANILLA
P.S. KENNEDY DATE:
The report appears to be analyzing one filmstrip and four photographic prints. The analysis states that the processing of this photography is poor, and it is difficult to determine whether the alleged UFO were examined without result or if there were three objects. The analysis also mentions that the photograph could not be made to produce more detail or definition, and that there is a possibility the photograph is double-exposed. The report concludes with an inconclusive determination regarding the identity of the object in the photograph.
