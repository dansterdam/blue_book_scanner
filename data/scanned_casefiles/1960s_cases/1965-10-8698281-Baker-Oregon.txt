The image appears to be a low-quality, grayscale scanned document with a dark, somewhat blurry central image that is difficult to discern details from. The image looks like it might be a technical photograph or diagram, but the resolution and contrast make it hard to identify specific elements.

V66-2

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT

ANALYST: MAJ QUINTANILLA     PT: KINNEY     DATE: 12 JAN 66

This is in response to Work Order 66-3 submitted by Maj. Quintanilla, TDEV/UFO, requesting an analysis of one filmstrip and four photographic prints to possibly determine the source, identity, characteristics, etc., of an alleged unidentified flying object imaged thereon. The following analysis represents a joint effort involving TDDPA (Photo Analysis) and TDDP (Photo Processing).

The processing of this photography is poor to the point that it is difficult to determine what is and what is not an image. Several possible images similar to the alleged UFO were examined without result, except that on three occasions, these traces appear to go through telephone wires. (In other words, if a stated, the object was moving it should have produced more than one image as shown, assuming that the photography was time exposed. The lack of camera data in addition to the facts previously outlined lend credence to the possibility that the photography examined is double-exposed. A definite determination as to whether or not the object is a star could not be made; however, the probability of such being the case is strong in view of its similarity with other objects in the photograph.

The text in this image is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The page contains four photographic images arranged in a 2x2 grid, each appearing to be a slightly different version or exposure of the same scene. There are some faint circular markings visible in some of the images, but the details are too obscured to make out clearly.
