JUNE

To: USAF, Hq., Pentagon, Washington DC

Subject: Observation Report on UFO

One week ago, in the vicinity of 9 and Rhode, along in Falls Church, riding north on 29th just south of 7, I suddenly saw ahead me a relatively large 150 to 200 feet high an object moving not on a direct line, so that by the time I slowed a few steps it passed from sight over the heavy wooded area. Instantly saw building, suddenly as a slightly descending rate. In my surprise I noticed several people on the corner and asked if they saw it but none had. I was close and it just to the north of the intersection about a new listing in north of a house 1° line that seen it and we will you and he thought it was a shooting star. But I like to had appeared to be to the southward of where he was sitting, so this my view of it indicate it was quite low and about over the middle of the black top road. I and traveling north or NE. What makes it unusually interesting is that it appeared to me to be about the size of a football or a bit larger, glowing brightly with a red-green light, with a slight tail of orange color. The descending path, by my go, as much a definite angle that I would not have been surprised to have known this landed only a couple of blocks away but this was apparently illuminating—exactly as and not descending so steeply as I had thought.

I do not consider it to have been a mysterious object but something to itself.

For your records.
