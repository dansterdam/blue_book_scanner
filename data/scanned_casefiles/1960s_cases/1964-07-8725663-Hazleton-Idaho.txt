The image provided contains a diagram and instructions for a UFO sighting report. The diagram appears to depict the relative position and movement of an unidentified object in the sky. There are instructions for the observer to indicate the compass direction where the object was first seen, as well as to draw a picture showing the path and changes in the object's direction during the sighting.

The text found in the document is as follows:

27. If the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it, place a "+" on the 
show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "0" 
on the compass where you first saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at  
the start, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. 
I was traveling north at about 15 miles per hour on the highway. This object was traveling in the same direction about a mile to the west at an altitude of 300 to 500 feet. Its speed was about 500 miles per hour. It was about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, round in shape, and silver in color. It seemed to wobble and turn as it traveled and was visible for about 4 to 5 minutes.
It disappeared when it went behind some trees. I have no other information that I think would be pertinent.
