I believe that the UFO seen by these people may have been a phenomenon associated with the temperature inversion. New York State Police confirmed the sighting - 2 patrolmen saw the object.

L. Physical Evidence: Possibly one photograph which has not yet been developed. will forward same if it turns out.
