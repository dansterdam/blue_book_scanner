34. Date you complained this questionnaire: 7-29-63
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I was standing in my back yard on the night of July 29, 1963, when I observed a bright light moving across the sky. The object appeared to be round, was quite bright, and was moving slowly in an almost horizontal path. As it passed overhead, I observed it make a slight change in direction. The object was in sight for approximately two minutes. During this time, I observed that the object seemed to vary slightly in intensity and that it left no trail or exhaust.
After the object passed from view, I waited sometime hoping to see it again, but it did not reappear. I have no other details to add, but am quite sure of the accuracy of the above information.

The text appears to be a handwritten response to a questionnaire about a sighting of an unidentified flying object on July 29, 1963 in Susanville, California.

Output of the text in the document:

"Where there sighted the movemant of the object like two circular discs or looking for something appeared to be floating for a brief time. And when going by the case as it is written down the sighting occurred about 5:30 in the morning the object or disc like objct came from the north went over and stood for about 30 minutes and then took off down to the south at a very fast speed the witness stated that when the object came into view it was an brightsilver color and when it went away it was red in color. And it made no sound at all. And when it took off it just vanished out of sight. The witness felt that the object was about 1/2 the size of a standard car at arms length. And it did not appear to have windows or doors or any other thing the round shape. When it was standing still it did not wobble or seem to spin in any way. It just seemed to be floating or hovering in the sky. And when it took off it was gone in just seconds. The witness felt that this was a very unusual and strange object and is still very much convinced that what he saw was not an airplane, satellite or any other known object."
