10. LOCATION OF KNOWN AIR TRAFFIC IN AREA OF SIGHTING. FAA CENTERS AT MINNESOTA, STATED THAT THIS IS A WELL TRAVELED AIRWAYS THOUGH IT WAS NOT HEAVY AT THE TIME. THEY FEEL THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AIRCRAFT WERE IN THE AREA AT THAT TIME INTERVAL, 080502 AND 080602.

11. POSITION TITLE AND COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: CHIEF OF INTELLIGENCE, IN VIEW OF THE CHANGING WEATHER PICTURE DURING 080519Z AND 080540Z, IT BECOMES POSSIBLE THAT THE OBSERVER AND HIS MALE AND FEMALE COMPANION DID ACTUALLY SEE THE OBJECT THROUGH THE TEMPORARY BREAK IN CLOUD COVERAGE AS ALLEGED. IF AN AIRCRAFT WERE GOING NORTHWEST AT A HIGH ALTITUDE THE FLASHING RED LIGHT WOULD BE OBSERVED, AND NOTHING ELSE. THE OBSERVER FURTHER REPORTED ON A SUBSEQUENT TELEPHONE INTERVIEW THAT LATER HE SAW A SINGLE RED LIGHT WHICH WOULD BE OBSERVABLE WHEN THE AIRCRAFT TURNED AND FLEW TOWARD HIM, IN THIS CASE THE

GREEN NAVIGATION LIGHT WOULD NOT BE OBSERVED AS HE LATER REPORTED
A GREEN LIGHT WAS SEEN. IN THIS POSITION THE OBJECT WOULD
TEND TO BE MOTIONLESS, UNTIL IT TOOK UP A NEW HEADING. THE
OBSERVER IN THE LAST CONVERSATION STATED HE DID SEE A GREEN
LIGHT AND THEN SOME TIME LATER THE BLINKING RED LIGHT AGAIN.
THIS POSSIBLY COULD BE A HIGH ALTITUDE AIRCRAFT WHO WAS TAKING
A DOG LEG ON A BOX TO MAKE A CONTROL TIME OR ETA GOOD TO A
GIVEN POINT.
