UFO SIGHTING

Received a call from the Command Post Duty Officer, Major J. E. Edwards, Warner-Robbins AFB, Ga. who passed on information to us relating to an UFO sighting. His was third party information since it was passed to him by the Officer of the Day who actually interviewed the individuals reporting the sighting.

Mr. [redacted] observed the object and was corroborated by Mr. [redacted] of the same city. Observation was made at approximately 2345 EST 5 Aug 60 at Sandersville, Ga. which is 3 miles from Tennell. Object was estimated at 1000 feet altitude and observed for a period of 2 to 3 seconds. Appeared as varying pulsating white light of great intensity proceeding on a north to south course. Course was non-orbital and appeared erratic. Definitely not a rotor in the estimation of the observers. Sheed of the object was excessive however, had no definite shape.

The Officer of the Day, Captain Mitchell questioned the observers resulting in the above information and can be reached Warner-Robbins, Ga.

Edwards, is weather conditions at the time of the sighting, whether the observation was made while in a vehicle, etc., however he could not offer any more since he was not directly involved. Didn't think it was proper or result in much more information by calling Warner-Robbins and talking to Captain since he was not directly involved, nor the individuals concerned.

Here is the text from the document:

(a) Velocity: 10 miles.

(c) Cloudst 0.8; East through S.W. moving NE (occasional lightning in clouds east through southwest).

(c) Temperature: 76Â°.

h. No unusual activity or conditions which might account for the sighting.

1. No interception or identification taken locally.

4. No local information available as to air traffic or balloon releases which could possibly have accounted for the sighting in the area.

i. Due to distance from the area in question (approximately 8 miles) and the fact that no control since the initial sighting, neither vital data nor information or radar (G.C.A.) was available, nor was it possible to correlate the sighting with any known ballistic or other aerial activity, the report must be left in a suspended status.
