There is no legible text in this image. The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a UFO or flying saucer-like object hovering above a building and some bare trees in a winter or leafless landscape. The photograph seems to be from a UFO report document, with a grainy, vintage quality typical of 1960s photographic documentation.

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major Quartermiller,

I am a sixteen year old boy and have many interest. One of my interest is photography. I develop all pictures sent) I do believe in flying saucers but have never really seen any myself so I decided to make a few of my own. Of course I tell my friends that they are real and they look at them with amazement and really believe it. It's starting to get out of hand, so I thought I'd let you know about it and how I did it. I'm sure you will agree with my friends, that they look quite real.

Here are the pictures and how I faked them:
Pictures 1,2,3, and 4 are all done by double exposure. First I cut out different signs and shapes of flying saucers out of paper and pasted them on a black cloth. Then I made the first exposure, the second exposure is taken over a lens and trees which gives it the effect of a flying saucer.

Youngstown, Ohio 44512
January 20, 1968


- page 4 -

Pictures 115 and 116 are simply done by pasting a small picture of a flying saucer on a window- and taking the picture through the glass. I framed the scene on the trees and house so it gives the saucer a blurred and moving effect.

I hope these pictures will give you some idea of how easy it is to fake flying saucers. Maybe they will help you to prove some of the hoaxes that are sent in.

Yours Sincerely,

P.S. If you are to publish these could you please let me know when and where they will be published.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                     1 February 1968

Subject: Conversation with Hancock Field, regarding UFO reports

Lt Marano spoke with Captain St John and Lt Cunningham regarding the UFO reports they have been submitting to the UFO office at Wright-Patterson. Lt Cunningham gave the following report over the telephone. Sighting of 27 January at 0251, disc shape, size of an airplane (piper cub) at 4000 - 5000 ft, orange in color, dim, Was "a" form, six objects, unknown size, no sound, nothing unusual - the Fire department's radio in the Chief's car radio had static. Looked up and noticed object, no angle or azimuth, heading east slowly, disappeared like blowing a match out. Total observation was ten minutes, ground visual, with no optical aids. Time was give as 27/0230Z, night (Discrepancy here with date and time given earlier in report). Observed at Moyers Corners, Fire Department, Morgan and Buckly, Fire Department # 6268421. Observers were: Dave Morgan, 6049 Morgan Road, Liverpool New York, college, age 21 and Ken J Brand, RD #4, Rt 57, Belleville, New York.

WEATHER, SURFACE
surface         140 deg           5 knots

50,000 ft       290 deg           20 knots
80,000 ft       290 deg           30 knots

Large inversion from surface to 10,000 ft. No interceptive identification taken, no aircraft in the area at the time, nothing unusual on radar.

Reporting officer: TSgt JJ Wedge, SDT. Comments Received many calls on same sighting, all same basic area. Passed it on to the


- page 17 -

the first Air Force. Lt Marano requested that they contact the
local police and have them see if they saw anything or had any
unusual reports, and if so send copies to us. Contact the Control
Tower and see if anyone saw anything unusual and make a statement
(Hancock) that we/have radar coverage and that nothing unusual was sighted
during this time period..

Lt Marano and Capt St. John discussed the UFO reports that had
been made to us incorrectly. Captain St. John said that they realized
that they had had a slip shod program on these UFOs so Col
Sheppard set up new policies and decided to have the Intelligence
Officer investigate the reports. Now they turn the reports over
to the Intel people for investigation and they in turn send them
back to the Info Office upon completion. Lt Marano explained that
if a report was investigated/they did not have to send it to Wright-
Patterson. Lt Marano told him that we would finish up the reports
they had previously sent to us since they are so old, however, they
should investigate the report of 27 January and submit inaccord with
the regulation.

George Junior Republic
Freeville, New York 13068

1. This replies to your recent correspondence on an unidentified
Flying object (UFO) sighting of 12 January 1968.
The Air Force does not investigate second hand reports.
However, if Miss wishes to report her observation to the
Air Force, she may do so by completing the enclosed AF Form 117
and returning it to our office in the envelope provided.

2. Anyone observing what they consider to be an UFO should report
it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base since the
local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an
on-the-spot investigation.

3. As you requested, we are returning the report of 12 January.
Thank you for bringing this observation to our attention.

Addressee: George P. Freeman, Sr.
Lt. Colonel, USAF

Dear Colonel Freeman:

Enclosed is a copy of a cover letter with an attached letter of introduction and correspondence with the Colorado University UFO Study Group which I have sent to the Commanding Officer, Public Information Complex, Hqrl. Parsanna Offices of Hqrs. AFCIN, (Capt. Pena) and I hope you will be of some assistance to obtain some sort of cooperation regarding our investigation of UFO sightings in the Massachusetts area.

No doubt, my request will be brought to the attention of SAFOL local and direction. I would appreciate hearing from the SAFOL local myself as negotiating our mutual cooperation.

My own feeling is that many UFO sightings slip through the crack because of the reasons outlined in the enclosed cover letter and others. I do feel that the local aid and our unit can be of some mutual help to each other. The reports, I am certainly, are always would be forwarded PTO WPATE as well as NICAP and the CU UFO Project.

May I hear from you? Thank you very much for giving this matter your attention.

Sincerely,
Raymond E. Fowler

SUBJECT: Local AFB cooperation with Colorado UFO Study Early Warning Network

DATE:

FROM: Raymond E. Fowler
Early Warning Coordinator - CU UFO PROJECT
Chairman NICAP Mass. Group

TO: Commanding Officer *

cc: Base UFO Officer *
Base PIO
SAFOI, Washington, D.C.

* - Sent to: Hanscom Field, CEAS AFB,
Pease AFB and Westover AFB

Attached is a letter of introduction and recommendation from Dr. Robert J. Lo(x)s,
Project Coordinator, UFO Study - University of Colorado. Dr. Lee confirms my
telephone conversation with the CU UFO Study early warning network chairman
and to the Chairman of the Massachusetts Investigating Subcommittee for the
National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, Washington, D.C. which
is cooperating with the CU UFO Study. In his letter, Dr. Lee has encouraged
you to cooperate with me in any way possible. How you could help us is outlined
below.

Although local AFB's do conduct initial investigations of significant UFO
sightings as per AFR 80-17, it is apparent that all UFO sightings received
from civilians at the AFB level cannot be followed up for such reasons as
listed below:

1. The inability on the part of the Officer or Airman to clearly truly
determine which sightings might be significant on the basis of a
telephone or all brief contact.

2. The lack of sufficient personnel to personally field-check all
UFO reports in a crisis.

3. The fact that most sightings, especially by children, are due to
misidentification of natural objects or phenomena and that investigation
of such reports would be time-consuming and unproductive.

This is where the WUPP UFO Study could provide a helpful resource. If the
Base UFO Officer or PIO would relay these reports not being followed up by

Here is the text from the document:

to FTD (WEST) Wright Patterson AFB, the GU UFO Study, Boulder, Colorado and
ATIC, Washington, D.C.

Another way the local AFB through SAFOI has been and could continue to be of
help is to provide data upon request, pertaining to US/F Theo. Doege and
other type of similar data to better enable us to make a field-level correlating
of UFO sightings. This has been done to some extent but closer and more rapid
cooperation is desired in this case.

I have at my disposal a 17-man team comprised of Eng.(1), Aeronautical(3)
Chem.(2),Physicist(2); Mathematician(1); Psychol.(1); Zoology, Bacteriol.(1);
Milit. Training Director(1); Geologist(1) and a variety of special investigators
a Detective(5). A variety of pertinent equipment is available to us. Stationed
NICAP and GU UFO Study questionnaires are used.

In short, cooperation on your part in this or other ways(s) would be greatly
appreciated as well as being of great value to private and governmental
UFO research. If required, certain aspects of such cooperation would be
kept strictly confidential. Names and addresses, etc. of UFO witnesses are
always kept confidential if so requested.

UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO
BOULDER, COLORADO 80302

202 Woodbury Hall

8 December 1967

Mr. Raymond E. Fowler
NICAP Massachusetts Investigation Subcommittee
13 Friend Court
Wenham, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Fowler:

Dr. Craig has asked me to write you a letter that explains the relationship between the Massachusetts Subcommittee and the UFO Project in Colorado. I am glad to do this.

As you point out in your information sheet, NICAP has been cooperating closely with the Colorado group in its scientific study of unidentified flying objects. NICAP headquarters in Washington has provided duplicates of some of the best known cases for study by the Colorado project, and they have kept the Colorado group informed of current sightings of interest. This last function is a very important one, and you of course act as one of the members of our early-warning Network, which serves as the cornerstone of our program to develop a communication system that will give us news of sightings soon enough—for us to get out into the field before the trail gets cold and the evidence stale.

While the relationship between your subcommittee and our project is informal, and there is no direct administrative connection, nevertheless the work you are doing is of great importance to the success of our investigation. Hence, I would encourage persons having information on UFOs, whether in the government or outside, to cooperate with you in every way possible. It is certainly true that anyone who helps you is, indirectly, helping us. Our work, in turn, which is being done with Federal funds, was authorized in response to a widely expressed public need for a careful review of the entire UFO problem.

Feel free to show this letter to anyone you wish.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

On the evening of January 17th around 9:30 pm. Ted Colck, Kathy Bell, and I were riding home from Cages Back on Argilla Rd. toward the center of Ipswich. Suddenly Ted slowed the car and told us to look at the object in the sky. I got scared right away. Teddy turned the radio off and brought the car to a near stop. I noticed how large and bright the lights were. The object seemed to be standing still. Suddenly it crossed the road in front of us toward our left. I have ever seen. I think it rose a little, but I didn't want to look at it but nothing doing. Teddy so leave and being no home. Then it disappeared and I noticed how stupid it was to be scared and we turned around a little for the back again.

On the night of January 19 at 9:15, I was driving home from Conn. Bridge. About 1 mile from at 1105 in a thruway off ramp, as I was slowing, approached at being agent, I slacked off notice & looked and became of the stop. I heard us rise on a conversational line. The lines were turned towards my I caught the outline of a brightly shaped object. There while the lines faced a unit with the brightness of full mags as I could only see the outline of a figure shaped object, according to the set up of the my/car was extensively able to say the object in clearly was assisting me. Myself and my female passenger alongside the object. I continued straight in about 5 miles, then crossed the road directly in front of my lights, parked in my direction about 50 feet above ground. I then became to accelerate such of plan out the view in this version.

My reaction at the time was curiosity. I was to get a large look at it slowed my car. The yards between still and shaking and enjoy while taking on sight at my own. Kathy's reaction was just being stunned. I don't think we really if any of us. Such might was the characteristic lens was run. Total time of 45 to 60 seconds.

Lt Marano talked to M--- the head of the Short Lived Phenomena section at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Mr. --- did not think that it was very likely that the object was a meteorite on the basis of the preliminary analysis.

Subj: Physical Specimen, Cypress Gardens Florida, 2 June 1968

Lt Carmon L Marano spoke with Mr Edward Williams, AGIC, regarding a
specimen recovered at Cypress Gardens, Florida. The approximate content of
90% silicon dioxide and 10% iron oxide would not be a meteorite. Normally
a meteorite is quite heavy and this sample is light and appears to have a lot
of air holes. The specimen is probably volcanic rock (pumice) and could have
come up from the hot springs. The gases escaping would cause air holes and the
specimen could be warm to the touch when it arose to the surface of the
water.

REMARKS:
Gene:

Reference your note concerning the gray porous object found at Cypress Gardens, Florida. We have examined the object and find no reason to extend the evaluation any further. We are unable to determine if the object is martensitic in origin. Possibly Lt/Col Quintanilla's shop would be helpful in this regard.

ATTN OF: BTWT/Lt Col Williams/494-7701

SUBJECT: Evaluation of Foreign Object Recovered at Cypress
Gardens, Fla., 2 June 1968

TO: FTD (TDAM)(Mr. E. P. O'Keefe)
Wright-Patterson AFB
Ohio 45433

Dear Mr. O'Keefe:

With reference to our telephone conversation this morning at 0815, 20 June 1968, I am sending you the material found in the Lake at Cypress Gardens, Florida, on 2 June 1968. The substance was found by a Mr. Raymond Videtto. Mr. Videtto was water skiing at that time and he heard a sudden terrific "whoosh" behind him simultaneous with something strikingly the water causing geysers of steam and spray.

The noise was sufficiently loud to scare him and he turned around to go back to see what had impacted in the water and found the material contained in this package floating on the surface still warm to the touch. Mr. Videtto turned the material over to Dr. Joseph H. Purser, Polk Junior College, Winter Haven, Florida, 33880, whom I understand is head of the Department of Science there. I talked with Dr. Purser by phone and he sent the material to me after promising to do so. We obtained permission to evaluate it with the stipulation that analysis techniques used leave the object structurally undisturbed.

Dr. Purser would like to retain the object for his school laboratory and, therefore, we are asking that you return it in as good condition as possible to this office so that we can forward it to Dr. Purser when have completed your investigation. We would appreciate some feedback on your findings which would be appropriate to give to Dr. Purser in exchange for his cooperation in the matter.

Dr. Purser told me that he believes the object to be meteoric in origin, unrelated to man-made space objects. He stated his preliminary tests showed that it was about 90% silicone dioxide and 10% iron oxide. He said that he believed most of the iron content had been burned out by the heat of re-entry which was evidently sufficient to cause the silicone dioxide to melt and even boil, which would condense into an extremely light weight, very porous structure by the cooling effect of the water.
