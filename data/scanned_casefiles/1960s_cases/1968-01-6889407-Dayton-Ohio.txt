Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am writing to you about an old sighting I had many years ago. One of my contacts, a photographer, photographed it at the time. (I do not have all the pictures sent) I do believe in flying saucers but have never really seen any until this event, which I would describe as being a few of my wares. Of course, I told my friends that they are really among us and no one will believe it. They actually saw a lot of them with many some and really believe it. As for starting to get out of hand, I would like to say that they are on the best terms without us or my friends that they could make real use of.

Here are the pictures and how I have them: Pictures #1, #2, and #4 are all done by flashlight exposure. First, I cut out different sizes and shapes of things and attach them on a black cloth. Then I would take the first exposure. The second exposure is there over a few minutes, and then the last one. There are several small spots or reflections in the glass resulting from this trick.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten letter or report.

Picture us and its suddenly there. It appeared to pass on a conver- and which is the picture through the glass. I noticed the trees and house as it came the same a blurred and moving effect.
I hope these pictures will give you some idea. Maybe they do not have the same some of them.
P.S. If you are to publish this, I would appreciate if my name and where they live will not be published.

This appears to be a scanned image of a handwritten document, likely related to a UFO report. The text describes the witness's observation of an object that appeared suddenly and passed through the glass, with a blurred and moving effect. The witness hopes the pictures provided will give some idea, though they may not be the same as the witness's experience. The postscript indicates the witness prefers their name and location not be published if the content is to be published.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subject: Conversation with Hancock Field, regarding UFO reports
Lt Marano spoke with Captain St John and Lt Cunningham regarding the UFO reports they have been submitting to the UFO office at Wright-Patterson. Lt Cunningham gave the following report over the telephone:
Sighting of 27 January at 0251, disc shape, size of an airplane (piper cub) at 4,000 - 5,000 ft, orange in color, dim, "a" form, six objects, unknown size, no sound, nothing unusual - the fire department's radio in the Chief's car radio had static. Looked up and noticed object, no angle or azimuth, heading east slowly, disappeared like blowing a match out. Total observation was ten minutes, ground visual, with no optical aids. Time was give as 27/02302, night (Discrepancy here with date and time given earlier in report). Observed at Meyers Corners, Fire Department, Morgan and Buckly, Fire Department # 6528421. Observers were: Dave Morgan, 6049 Morgan Road, Liverpool New York, college, age 21 and Ken J Brand, RD #4, Rt 57, Belleville, New York.
WEATHER, SURFACE
Surface     140 deg

the first Air Force.- Lt Marano requested that they contact the local police and have them see if they saw anything or had any unusual reports, and if so send copies to us. Contact the Control Tower and see if anyone saw anything unusual and make a statement that we/have radar coverage and that nothing unusual was sighted during this time period..

Lt Marano and Capt St. John discussed the UFO reports that had been made to us incorrectly. Captain St. John said that they realized that they had had a slip shod program on these UFOs so Col Sheppard set up new policies and decided to have the Intelligence Officer investigate the reports. Now they must turn the reports over to the Intel people for investigation and they in turn send them back to the Info office upon completion. Lt Marano explained that if a report was investigated/they did not have to send it to Wright-Patterson. Lt Marano told him that we would finish up the reports they had previously sent to us since they are so old, however, they should investigate the report of 27 January and submit inaccord with the regulation.

UFO Observation, 12 January 1963

Mr. George Junior Republic
Prewville, New York 13063

1. This replies to your recent correspondence on an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting of 12 January 1963. The Air Force does not investigate sightings and reports, however, if you desire to report this observation to the Air Force, she may do so by completing the inclosed AF Form 117 and returning it to the envelope provided.

2. Anyone observing what they consider to be an UFO should report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base since the local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

3. As you requested, we are returning the report of 12 January. Thank you for bringing this observation to our attention.

My observation was on January 6, 1968 at about 6:35 P.M. while driving a light green 1964 Ford Falcon station wagon on a country road between Dayton, Ohio and Carlisle, Ohio. The object was hovering approximately 100 feet in the air and appeared to be lighted from the inside. It was circular in shape and was about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object moved slowly at first and then accelerated rapidly and went out of sight. I did not see any beams of light or exhaust from the object. I could not make out any surface details on the object due to the distance and the bright illumination from the inside. The object was visible for about 2 to 3 minutes.

GA. YOU'RE LOOKING YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS SIGHTED. ALSO PLACE A '1' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE OBJECT MOVED.

1. THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A '1' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST OBSERVED. CONNECT THE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO SHOW THE PATH OF MOVEMENT. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT. IF THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAGING, REFER TO A SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SECTION.

SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14 - CASE NO. 10285

1. About 8:00 p.m., March 29, 1958, witness saw a bright light in the sky moving rapidly in the southwest area of Dayton, Ohio.
2. The witness, Mr. Fowler, was driving his car at the time and immediately stopped and got out to observe the UFO. He described it as a very bright light moving in a straight line at high speed. It appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground and was visible for approximately 15-20 seconds before it disappeared.
3. Mr. Fowler stated that the object was much brighter than an aircraft and moved much faster than any aircraft he had ever seen before. He eliminated the possibilities of it being a meteor or a satellite.
4. No further details are available on this sighting. There were no other witnesses reported. The weather was clear at the time of the sighting.

REPORT OF CONFERENCE CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

DATE OF CONFERENCE: 8 January 1968

PLACE OF CONFERENCE: USAF Project Blue Book, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio

ATTENDEES: Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr., USAF, Director, Project Blue Book 
Lt Col Wendell T. Jones, USAF, Staff Officer, Project Blue Book
Mr. Delbert Newhouse, civilian, witness of sighting of UFO's

SUMMARY OF CONFERENCE:

Major Quintanilla and Lt Col Jones met with Mr. Newhouse to discuss his sighting of unidentified flying objects (UFO's) on 1 July 1952 near Tremonton, Utah. Mr. Newhouse provided details of his sighting and showed color motion picture film that he had taken at the time. The film was analyzed by personnel at Wright-Patterson AFB and it was determined that the objects depicted were not birds, aircraft, or other known phenomena. However, a definitive identification of the objects could not be made. The conference participants discussed the Tremonton, Utah UFO sighting in detail, but no conclusions were reached regarding the nature of the objects seen.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION - UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
(BASED ON USAF PROJECT BLUE BOOK ACTIVITY)

DATE: 29 Dec 1959

CASE - GT-3-59
FROM: Captain Ruppelt, Project Officer
THRU: SAFOI - U.S.A.F. 
TO: USAF

Dear Colonel Report:

Enclosed is the report of a case of a very strange and unexplained incident that occurred on 29 Dec 1959 near Phoenix, Arizona. Considerable investigation has been conducted by this project, and the results are presented herein. Public information is given where classified data is not involved.

No doubt, my request will be brought to the attention of SAFOI regarding our investigation of UFO sightings. Information and advice would be appreciated, as our director feels that this case warrants a very careful and thorough investigation.

My own feeling is that many UFO sightings do indicate the existence of strange aerial vehicles, the origin of which can be foreign or domestic. Their capabilities may exceed those of the best-known aircraft and often perplex professional observers of Air Force, National Guard, and civil aircraft. Every effort will be made to accumulate facts and determine the true nature of this case.

May I hear from you? Thank you very much for giving this matter your attention.

Sincerely,
RAYMOND H. FOWLER

SUBJECT: Local CPB cooperation with Colorado's UFO study group on Flying Saucer Investigation.

DATE: 

FROM: Raymond E. Fowler
Field Investigator Coordinator - CE UFO Project
Chairman: Local Mass Group

TO: * - Sent to: Gerald K. Haines, Grand Saline, Texas
Pease AFB and Westover AFB

Attached is a letter of introduction and recommendation from Dr. Robert J. Low(*), Professor of Psychology, University of Colorado, stating that the Dr. Low has informed me and requested that I cooperate with the NICAP group in Dayton, Ohio in any way possible. How you could help us do entitled cases with the CE UFO Study Group.

Although Local CPB's do conduct initial investigations of significant UFO sightings per AFR 80-17A, it is apparent that all UFO sightings received from civilian sources, civilian crews and military authorities according to the NICAP, should be carefully investigated for such extent as possible. In this connection, I would appreciate your cooperation in any way possible. How you could help us do entitled cases with the CE UFO Study Group.

1. The inability on the part of the Offices or Airmen to clearly determine which sightings might be significant on the basis of a telephonic preliminary report.

2. The lack of sufficient personnel to adequately field dispatch all UFO reports received.

3. The need that investigations be undertaken as quickly as possible while "trace" evidence remains identifiable.

8 December 1967

Mr. Raymond E. Fowler
NICAP Massachusetts Investigation Subcommittee 
13 Friend Court
Wenham, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Fowler:

Dr. Craig has asked me to write you a letter that explains the relationship between the Massachusetts Subcommittee and the UFO Project Colorado. I am glad to do this.

As you point out in your information sheet, NICAP has been cooperating closely with the Colorado group in its scientific study of unidentified flying objects. NICAP headquarters in Washington has provided duplicates of some of the Colorado group's material, and they have kept the Colorado group informed of current sightings. This last function is a very important one, for the Colorado group is part of a national information network, which serves as the cornerstone of our program to develop a communication system that will give us news of sightings soon enough for us to get out into the field before the trail gets cold and the witnesses scattered.

While the relationship between your subcommittee and our project is informal, and there is no direct administrative connection, nevertheless the work you are doing is of great importance to the success of our investigation of the UFO problem, whether in the government or outside, to cooperate with you in every way possible. If it is certainly true that anyone who helps you is, indirectly, helping us. Our work, in turn, which is being done with regard to funds, was authorized in response to a widely-expressed public need for a careful review of the entire UFO problem.

Feel free to show this letter to anyone you wish. 

Sincerely yours,

Project Coordinator

1. WITNESSES WERE DRIVING FROM CRANES BEACH, IPSWICH TO THE CENTER OF IPSWICH ON ARGILLA ROAD IN SW DIRECTION ALONG ARGILLA ROAD BETWEEN 9:15 AND 9:30 PM (5/15/68)

2. BRIGHT LIGHTS SUDDENLY APPEARED TO THEIR RIGHT AT 260° W/4.5° ELEVATION AND DROPPED TO BE ATTACHED TO A SOLID OBJECT.

3. TED CIOLELEK'S INITIAL IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE OBJECT WAS TRIANGULAR. SHAPED AND WHEN IT CAME CLOSER, IT LOOKED CIGAR-SHAPED.

4. BARBARA CAMPBELL'S FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A TRIANGLE, VERY BRIGHT, WITH A ROW (HORIZONTAL) WHEN IT CAME CLOSER.

5. IT APPROACHED THEM, THEN STOPPED ABOUT 1/2 MILE AWAY FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS BEFORE CROSSING THE ROAD DIRECTLY IN-FRONT OF THEM SLOWLY. IT THEN ACCELERATED AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT_WATCHED UNTIL OVER HORIZON.

6. WELL LAST OBSERVED TO WAS MOVING AWAY IN A 230° DIRECTION. THE 5 MINUTE LIGHTS ALWAYS FADED THE OBSERVES

7. DURING THE ENCOUNTER, TED HAD SLOWED THE CAR TO A CRAWL AND THINNED OFF THE RADIO AND HEATER TO SEE IT BETTER. THE OBJECT WAS MAKING ANY NOISE.

8. AT ITS CLOSEST, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 80-100 FEET AND A DISTANCE OF 250-400 FEET AWAY.

9. WHEN IT CROSSED THE ROAD IN-FRONT OF THE CAR, TED FLASHED HIS HEADLIGHTS AT IT BUT GOT NO RESPONSE.

10. TED'S REACTION WAS QUICK, HARDLY WAS STUNNED AND SPEECHLESS, BUT BARBARA SEEMED SHAKEN AND SAID SHE WAS STILL UPSET.

On the evening of January 17, at around 9:30 PM, the witness saw two bright lights and a car over the Ohio Beach area. The car and lights then disappeared behind the trees, and the witness then saw them reappear and fly away very rapidly. The object seemed to be hovering and then took off at a high rate of speed. The witness reported being very excited and unsettled by the incident and had a difficult time sleeping afterward.

On the night of January 12, 1968, two observers in Dayton, Ohio, reported seeing a bright light in the sky. The light was described as being larger than a star and moving at a high rate of speed. The observers tried to follow the light but lost sight of it after a short time.

The report goes on to describe the witnesses' observations in detail, including the movement and size of the light. It also mentions that the observers contacted the local authorities to report the sighting.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or memo describing a "Physical Specimen" recovered from Cypress Gardens, Florida on 2 June 1968. The memo discusses the approximate content of the specimen, which is described as 90% silicon oxide and 10% iron oxide. The document notes that the specimen is light and appears to have a lot of air holes, and that gases escaping from it could have caused air holes and made the specimen warm to the touch when it came into contact with the surface of the water.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
11 JULY 1959

SUBJ: Physical Specimen, Cypress Gardens Florida, 2 June 1968

Lt Carmen I. Marano spoke with Mr Edward Williams, ACIC, regarding a specimen recovered at Cypress Gardens, Florida. The approximate content of 90% silicon oxide and 10% iron oxide would not be a meteorite. Normally a meteorite is quite heavy and this sample is light and appears to have a lot of air holes. The specimen is probably volcanic rock (pumice) and could have come up from the hot springs. The gases escaping would cause air holes and the specimen could be warm to the touch when it arose to the surface of the water.

Dear Mr. O'Keefe:

With reference to our telephone conversation this morning, 20 June 1968, regarding the material found in the lake at Cypress Gardens, Florida, on 2 June 1968. The substance was found by Mr. Viadetto. Mr. Viadetto was water skiing at that time and he heard a sudden terrible noise, something striking the water causing geysers or steam and spray. The noise was sufficient to frighten him and he saw the material floating on the surface of the water and found the material contained in this matching flotation on the surface. Mr. Viadetto turned the material over to Dr. Joseph H. Purser, Rollins College, Winter Haven, Florida, 33880, whom I understand is head of the Department of Science there. I talked with Dr. Purser by phone and he sent the material to me after promising to do so. We obtained the material and are awaiting your instructions on what the disposition of the same shall be.

Dr. Merser would like to retain the object for his school laboratory, though, as he is anxious that you return it to us as soon as possible to avoid any damage to his office so that we can continue your investigation. Dr. Purser would appreciate some feedback on your findings which would be very helpful to him in the matter.

Dr. Merser told me that he believes the object to be meteoric in origin, unrelated to manmade space objects. He stated his preliminary tests showed that it was about 90% silicone dioxide. He said that he believed most of the iron content had been burned out by an extremely high temperature, though the structure of the material indicated definite evidence of some type of severe structural distortion which he would condemn into an extremely light weight, very porous structure by the cooling effect of the water.

TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT FROM DOCUMENT:

DAYTON, OHIO 
6 JAN 1968 

On 6 January 1968, this event was reported to have occurred at approximately 11:30 AM EST. The witness, a Mrs. A. L. Stouffer, was looking out of a window of her home when she observed a very strange cloud formation in the sky. As she watched, the cloud formation appeared to flatten out and become more disc-shaped.

The witness stated that the object remained stationary for several minutes, then slowly moved towards the northwest and disappeared from view. She estimated the object to have been approximately the size of a medium-sized aircraft. 

No sound was heard and the object did not appear to be an aircraft of any kind. The witness was quite certain that what she observed was not a normal cloud formation or any type of aircraft.

LETTER TO MAJOR HECTOR QUINTANILLA
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Sighting Report
LOCATION: Dayton, Ohio
DATE: January 6, 1968

On January 6, 1968 at approximately 7:30 p.m., Mr. Robert Riggs, a resident of Dayton, Ohio, reported sighting an unidentified aerial object in the sky over his home. According to Mr. Riggs, the object appeared to be a bright, glowing light that moved rapidly across the sky, then suddenly disappeared. Mr. Riggs stated that the object was visible for only a few seconds, but during that time it seemed to travel a considerable distance.

Mr. Riggs immediately contacted the local police department to report the sighting. The police in turn notified the United States Air Force, and an investigation was initiated by Project Blue Book, the official Air Force program for investigating unidentified aerial phenomena.

As part of the investigation, Mr. Riggs was interviewed by Air Force personnel and asked to provide a detailed description of what he had observed. Mr. Riggs stated that the object was a bright, luminous light that appeared to be disc-shaped. He estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. Mr. Riggs also reported that the object moved at a high rate of speed, estimated to be around 1,000 miles per hour.

The Air Force investigation was unable to determine the precise nature or origin of the unidentified aerial object reported by Mr. Riggs. No other witnesses to the event were identified, and no physical evidence, such as photographs or radar tracking data, was obtained.

Based on the information provided by Mr. Riggs, the case was classified as "unidentified" by Project Blue Book. The Air Force concluded that, while the sighting was a genuine and credible report, there was insufficient evidence to determine the specific nature or source of the unidentified aerial object.

The case was thoroughly investigated, but remained unresolved. It has been included in the official records of Project Blue Book as an unidentified aerial phenomenon.
