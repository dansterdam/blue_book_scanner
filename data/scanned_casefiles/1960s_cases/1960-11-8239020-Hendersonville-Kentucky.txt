PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE 17 Nov 60
3. OBSERVING GROUP UFO Sighted 5:45 a.m.
6. DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATION The observer, a man who has had military training and some experience in aerial observation, reported the following: As he was driving to work at 5:45 a.m., his attention was drawn to a bright light in the sky about 35-40 degrees above the eastern horizon. The object was first seen as a brilliant white light, approximately the size of a dime at arm's length. It appeared to be moving slowly in a southerly direction. When first observed, the light was visible for about 30 seconds, then it faded and disappeared. After a short interval, the light reappeared, brighter than before, and began moving in a zigzag pattern. The light then faded again and finally disappeared completely. The observer called the Air Force Base shortly afterwards to report the sighting.
10. OTHER DETAILS OF SIGHTING The observer stated that he was familiar with aircraft lights and that this object was definitely not an aircraft. He said the light was too large, too bright, and maneuvered in a manner inconsistent with aircraft. Weather conditions were clear with unlimited visibility. This sighting was not photographed.
