Dear Gentlemen;

On September 2, 1962 we saw an UFO in the sky north of Jackson. About 50,000 miles above the earth. For a while it hovered in the same spot. Then it came down about 10,000 ft. It stayed there 5 minutes and 23 seconds. Then it moved south a little. It came down another 10,000 ft, stopped and stayed there about 2 minutes, came down to about 15,000 ft. above the ground stopped and stayed there 10 minutes 46 seconds. Then a cloud covered it for a minute. Then it looked like something on it moved. Then it hurdled straight up and met about two stripes. Then
