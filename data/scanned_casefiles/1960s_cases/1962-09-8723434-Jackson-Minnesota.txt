Jackson, Minnesota

Dear Gentlemen,

On Sept. 23, 1962 about 7:30 p.m. I saw a UFO, approximately 50,000 miles east of the earth. For a while it hovered then came down about 10,000 feet. It stayed there for 5 minutes and 23 seconds. It then went up again 10,000 feet, stayed and then came down again 10 minutes later. The object made no sound. It was like a little white light and seemed to be round. When it came down the second time it stayed for 10 minutes and 45 seconds and then went up again. That is about all I can tell you about it. I hope this information is of some help to you.

Sincerely,
[name redacted]
