Case 261: We agree with classification, but card statement is wrong: Moody says east to west while report says west to east, as it should be. On the rest of the month the committee is in full agreement (nearly).

Here is the text I can read from the document:

[Bottom of document appears to have partial list of items, with first visible item being:]
• DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT AS CIRCULAR
• SIZE HERE OF PIX
• POSITION, LIKE STAR AG AIRCRAFT LIMITS
• [Rest of list is cut off]

Some text in the middle of the document is too blurry or cut off to read completely.

The image appears to be a data table with multiple columns and rows. However, due to the low quality and faded nature of the scan, most of the text is illegible. I can make out some header text at the top of the page, but the specific details are not clear enough to confidently transcribe. The document seems to be a structured data sheet, possibly related to astronomical or scientific observations, but the specifics cannot be determined from this image.
