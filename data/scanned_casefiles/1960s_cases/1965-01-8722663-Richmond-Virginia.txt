Ceiling: None.
Visibility: 12 miles.
Cloud cover: high, thin scattered 5/10ths (1/10th opaque).
Thunderstorms: None.
Vertical temperature gradient: surface 45°F., 200 ft. 53°F., normal lapse rate above 200 feet.

3. The only unusual meteorological condition reported is the temperature described in g (2) above.

1. No interrogative action was taken due to a time delay from the sighting time to the report time. Mr. [redacted] reported his sighting to Langley AFB Command Post at 2100 local, 25 January 1965.

2. The Richmond, Virginia FAA facility reported an inbound on an Army plane which contacted Byrd Field at 1925 local time. This aircraft was on a VFR flight plan and could have been in the area of the sighting at 2100 local.

3. This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Dockum, USAF, 4500 Air Base Wing (DWQ-12), Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The description of this UFO was given by Mr. Taylor to Lieutenant Dockum during a personal interview on 26 January 1965.

1. The most probable cause of this sighting was reflected or angled ground light due to the low altitude temperature inversion. The existence of the temperature inversion was confirmed by the Byrd Field Weather Station (g (2)).

5. Another possible cause of this sighting was an airplane. Richmond FAA confirmed the existence of one plane in the area at the time of the sighting (5 (2)).

6. A third possible cause of this sighting would be the sun reflecting from an orbiting satellite. This possibility could be confirmed or denied by NORAD headquarters, SPADATS.

7. A fourth possible cause of this sighting was intentional public city seeking on the part of the reporter. This possibility was confirmed by the observer's great desire for information on UFO's in general. He certainly stated that he and his colleagues at LIFE were doing a "spoof". This show would include an interview with retired Major Keyhoe. Several UFO's were being an Air Force "point of contact" more than this specific sighting. The investigator referred Mr. [redacted] to USAF headquarters, Office of Information.
