FROM: PROJECT BLUE BOOK
1969 JULY 6—781985—DENVER, COLORADO
ATTN: CAPT H. C. JENSEN THIS IS IN ANSWER TO YOUR LETTER DATED 
APRIL 27 REQUESTING INFORMATION.
MR. JOHN DOE, 
ATTORNEY AT LAW
615 WEST 58TH STREET
DENVER COLORADO 80216
DEAR MR. DOE:
THIS LETTER IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF YOUR LETTER DATED APRIL 23, 1969 
CONCERNING THE SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT THAT OCCURRED ON 
JULY 6, 1969 IN DENVER, COLORADO.
PROJECT BLUE BOOK HAS CAREFULLY REVIEWED THE DETAILS OF THIS SIGHTING AND
HAS DETERMINED THAT IT FALLS WITHIN THE CATEGORY OF "INADEQUATE 
INFORMATION". THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA AVAILABLE TO PERMIT 
A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED.
WHILE WE REGRET THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A MORE DEFINITIVE ANALYSIS, 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE LACK OF COMPLETE INFORMATION IS A COMMON
OCCURRENCE IN MANY UFO REPORTS. UNLESS EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS ARE 
SUPPLEMENTED BY TANGIBLE EVIDENCE SUCH AS PHYSICAL TRACES, PHOTOGRAPHS, OR
RADAR DATA, IT IS OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO ARRIVE AT A FIRM CONCLUSION.
IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT COULD ASSIST IN THE EVALUATION
OF THIS SIGHTING, PLEASE FORWARD IT TO THIS OFFICE AT YOUR EARLIEST 
CONVENIENCE.
SINCERELY,
CAPT. H. C. JENSEN
PROJECT BLUE BOOK

JULY 5, 1969  
DENVER, COLORADO
AERIAL PHENOMENON  

On the evening of July 5, 1969, at approximately 2100 hours, a round, bright light was observed in the night sky over the Denver, Colorado, area. The object was observed for approximately one hour by several witnesses. The object appeared to hover and make sudden changes in direction. No noise was heard associated with the object.

The object was observed by four separate witnesses, all of whom were located in different areas around Denver. The descriptions of the object were consistent among the witnesses. The object was described as round in shape, bright white in color, and approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length. The object appeared to hover and make sudden, erratic movements, changing direction rapidly.

No physical evidence of the object was recovered, and no other information is available regarding this incident.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

WEEKLY MAP
JULY 21-27, 1969

This is a continuation of a weekly series of maps showing the stations participating in the Surface Weather Map program, and the stations for 7-12 Mc tropospheric and VHF/UHF propagation studies. 

The stations are located across the United States and are used in these studies to provide data on tropospheric and VHF/UHF propagation conditions. The data collected is used to identify areas of best or worst propagation.

The information includes the station location and call sign, the frequency used, the type of equipment, the transmitter power, antenna type and gain, and height above ground. The time of transmission, propagation mode, and frequency bands are also indicated. 

Reports that are printed are a summary of the information collected from the stations participating in the program.
