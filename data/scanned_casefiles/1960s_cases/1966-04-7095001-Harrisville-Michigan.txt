excitement in viewing such an object he decided to turn around and go back to Harrisville, Michigan, to locate a telephone to call his father. For approximately one mile the UFO followed his vehicle and then disappeared. The observer continued on for another mile and decided he would turn around and call his father from Alpena. At approximately the same location of the original sighting he saw the object again. At this time the object dropped straight down in a rapid descent and the observer thought it would crash to the ground; however, at tree top level it suddenly stopped and remained hovering.

mentioned in item 1, above, might well have been the answer. In view of the fact that the boy saw what he thought to be three UFOs the previous week and after talking the situation over with his father, decided it must have been aircraft or a figment of his imagination, however, because of the conversation with his father, and after looking at pictures of other reported sightings in Life Magazine, I personally feel he built into his imagination the object and its actions as reported. This same area was involved in another sighting on the 5th of April. A person, unknown, reported to the County Sheriff that he had just seen a glowing object which hovered within some trees and the object kept turning. The sheriff investigated and found that someone had tied a reflector from the limb of a tree.

1. None. A personal drawing, reflecting the object seen by the observer, is attached.
