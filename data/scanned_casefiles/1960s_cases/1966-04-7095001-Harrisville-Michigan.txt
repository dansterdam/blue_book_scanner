1. The hour observer sighted the UFO - Wurtsmith Air Force Base was in the process of recovering of the same officer that reported this sighting. The sighting occurred at approximately 2200Z-2300Z, and the recovery was 0650Z. Altitude in pattern is approximately 1,500 feet above ground.
b. Base Sergeant Major. Although the observer was sincere in his report, an object was seen as described, this writer feels there is another logical explanation for this sighting - that being a combination of aurora borealis (northern lights) and swamps gas, the latter being prevalent in this area. This, coupled with a less than adequate observation, may have given the impression of a somthing unusual in the sky.

The image appears to contain a handwritten note and a signature. The note mentions a "personal drawing, reflecting the object seen by the observer". However, there is no photograph or image present in this particular page of the document.

Extracting the text from the document:

mentioned in item l, above, might well have been the answer.  In view of the fact that the boy saw what he thought to be these UFOs the previous week after talking the situation over with his father he decided it must have been a figment of his imagination.  However, because of the conversation with his father, and after looking at pictures of other reported sightings in Life Magazine, I personally feel that he is still the object of some investigation.

1. None.  A personal drawing, reflecting the object seen by the observer, is attached.
