Dear Sirs:

The following incident happened on Friday, December 9, 1966 at about 8:30 P.M. I was out in the backyard of a friend's house and sitting at something with very bright flashing lights coming from the sky. Suddenly it appeared. It was moving rather slowly toward the southwest, so I can look directly west and got out my telescope.

On the hill in the clear, I got a good look at it and it seemed to be a porter reflecting telescope. It was just a few miles from where I was sitting. At first I thought it might be a satellite, but it was too slow and too low. It was definitely not an airplane...

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Note: Some words are difficult to read precisely, so I've transcribed as accurately as possible]

[First paragraph is partially illegible, but begins with something like:]
"... thing that was ... something ... and ..."

[Middle paragraphs are more clear:]
"That night the notion it state seen anything like it. I close it and yet the sun out that help advantage through lights of jets. That was Sunday age it was just on a star just west the NCAR with some bright light about the same brightness up to the that below it it told plain and how to come and look how just at that with the just in recently carried loud.

It was been a temperature surprise or some other attitude of our reflection.

A matter happened on early August. I was at hill in history of the home. But we spent talking about the thing which we had recently gotten. I felt..."

[The last paragraph becomes less clear and partially illegible]

The document appears to be a handwritten account of a UFO or unusual sighting experience, written on lined paper in cursive script.

The text on the page is partially legible. Here's what I can make out:

[First few lines are difficult to read clearly]

... have ... in ... temporarily ... identification ... communication ...

... thought ... after ... getting ... round ... thinking ... mostly ... about ... track

... though ... some ... though ... flying ... co-power

[The rest of the text is too blurry or illegible to transcribe with confidence]

There is a black redaction/censored section in the middle of the page, and the document appears to be a handwritten report on lined paper.
