The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The document contains a questionnaire with various questions about the witness's observations of the UFO object, including where they were located, what they were doing at the time, the direction and movement of the object, as well as questions about the witness's familiarity with directional terms and estimating the number of degrees the object appeared from the horizon.

The image contains three sketches. The first sketch is of a curved line representing the horizon, with an object above it. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine the object is above the horizon and to depict how high it appears to be.

The second and third sketches depict the viewer's perspective when they first saw the object ("A") and a later position ("B") where the object appeared smaller.

As an OCR system, I will now extract all the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
