Dear Sir,

I am writing you this letter to report what I and my children saw Friday night January 20.

It was about 7:15 I had just went outside to get into my car and go shopping. I am always out looking off. I am where the time. It was a clear night and quiet and no trains etc.

I saw this huge red-orange object. It looked round like perhaps not a true sphere. It was near as ground level to about 5 to 10,000 ft. It seemed to be just sitting there to west in a difficult off speed, faster than my go that I had seen. Silen, in fact the only thing

(Note: The last line appears to be cut off and incomplete)

Here is the text from the document:

that I have ever seen that went any faster was the times when I saw a falling meteor. But of course they traveled down vertically. The thing we saw was on its straight a horizontal path as you could make with a pencil. The size of this thing seemed to be that of a small jet perhaps a small smaller. We just watched it go out of sight and I do not think it took more than 45 to 60 seconds to disappear. But in that time it did look quite far, etc.

Then I started to look back toward the point where I first saw this thing. But about half way to this point I saw what looked like a star coming close to another. 9

Here is the text from the document:

waited for it to pass the first
star, it did then reported this
missing star out to the children.
N.B. watched it disappear also.
I have seen this happen many times
because I'm sure this second
sighting was a man made satellite
the color and speed of jet was just
like the man-for-the-satellite 9
have seen. This satellite was
much higher than the 1st sighting
which was the red & right of foot,
not only that but if I was to judge
the speed of this 2nd object, that
night I must say the jet is complete
thing just to make that satellite
look like it was standing still.
N.B. watched the satellite
disappear also and I headed for
my car. Just I must tell you
that the satellite was ticking.

East to West - for perhaps not from
here east to here. Surest just not
far from here, that's John Sowa
saying we watched it disappear.
I headed toward my car. About
100 feet away. I got half way to
my car when I saw a third
object in the sky. it was
coming from the west and
heading due east. It was not as
high as the reddish object
that saw as we watched one sighting
that night. Its speed was about
like a jet perhaps slow. I would
estimate the speed about 3 to 4 or
M.P.H. met the 60-700 M.P.H. that
jets can do. I would estimate its
height to be 2000 to 5000 ft. a
height quite light seemed to
vary from it and also a height
real light. Those lights were

Here is the text from the document:

very height and they never did
blink or swish in any way.
It passed right over my back
yard and I could not make out
the true shape of it on account of
these lights. But it appeared to
be pointed or slightly egg-shaped.
There was no sound came from
it or from the red greenish
object. Not even a hum or a
faintest silence. We watched
it disappear also. I felt like I
wanted to do something like
calling some air base but I
didn't know any numbers. I felt
that if I could have called you
the base, you could have perhaps helped Pittsburgh and had
it picked out. That thing out.
So in case I miss see anything
like that again just remember.
