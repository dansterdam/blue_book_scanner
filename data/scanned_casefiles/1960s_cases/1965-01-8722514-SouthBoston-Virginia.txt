This is in reply to your letter of January 15, 1965, to Headquarters USAF, Ohio, in which you requested an observation of an aerial object which you could not identify.

The object which you sighted was a meteor. Your observation was a brief sighting associated with a meteor shower which occurred in Silver Spring, Maryland, at that time.

I am enclosing for your information a copy of the current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project in scientific flying objects. This report should give you an insight into the program conducted by the Air Force.

Gentlemen:

Sunday Night January 10, 1965 at approx 7:15 PM, I saw an object in the sky that frightened me.

A loud humming noise made me look up and I saw something that I assumed was a large falling star. The object was traveling from North to South and left a long trail of sparks. It looked like a huge white sparkle. I could only see this for a few seconds because of clouds. Often a couple of minutes, I have found objects overhead, perhaps they were the same.

South Boston, Virginia... January 10, 1965... Two men say they saw a UFO over Cherry Hill at 7:30 p.m. last Thursday night. The two men, James Strickland and Dr. George L. Wilkinson apparently saw the same object.

Strickland, a business man, and a former chairman of the South Boston planning commission, was at work when a downtown building was due any moment. Headed off was a slight glare behind it a traveled at a high rate of speed.

Dr. Wilkinson (M.D.), and his could not describe the object to him it was only the "concept of a bright light" going at a phenomenal speed. Each of the men said they were unaware of the object's identity.

Strickland notified the AF at Wright Patterson AFB, sending along a copy of the report.
