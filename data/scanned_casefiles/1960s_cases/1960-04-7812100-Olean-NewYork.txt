Mr. Lawrence J. Tacker
Major, USAF

Dept. of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Tacker:

Read article- Olean Times, Olean, New York, dated 4/21/60 about 
group sighting of U.F.O.s on 4/16/60 at about 11:20 P.M. by two
Olean men.
                                                                OHIO

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN-462

SUBJECT: UFO Letter (Mgt Tacker)

TO: SAFOI-3d (Maj Tacker)

1. The Olean, New York sighting of 16 April 1960, has been evaluated.
2. The ATIC conclusion is that birds were the probable cause of this
sighting.

REMARKS: Larry- The answer here is that there is not
sufficient information for a definite conclusion.
Preliminary analysis indicates the possibility that
it was migrating birds flying high.
You can answer the part about the $10,000 fine.
