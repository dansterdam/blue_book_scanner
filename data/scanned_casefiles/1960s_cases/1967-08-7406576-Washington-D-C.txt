THE LATEST U.S. WEATHER BUREAU BALLOON LAUNCH WAS AT 0500 ZULU 22 AUG FROM STERLING, VA. THE BALLOON WAS NOT LIGHTED AND CAME APART AT 0100 ZULU. PREVAILING WINDS WOULD HAVE CARRIED THE BALLOON WELL TO THE EAST BEFORE

0100 ZULU. OBSERVERS FROM WASHINGTON NATIONAL TOWER AND ANDREWS TOWER UNABLE TO SEE THE OBJECT. POSSIBLE CAUSE FROM OBSERVERS' ACCOUNTS INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN A LIGHTED BALLOON FROM AN UNKNOWN AGENCY OR BY PERSON OR PERSONS TRYING TO PERPETRATE A HOAX.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                   24 Aug 67

SUBJECT:  UFO Observations, Maryland, 22 Aug 67

At 0915, 24 Aug 67, Major Quintanilla spoke with Captain Jensen and
Lt. Nielson of the Public Information Office, Andrews AFB, Maryland.

Lt. Nielson had investigated the reports on this particular UFO.

Major asked Lt. Nielson if he had checked with the police department
on this sighting. He said he hadn't but he had heard that the police
department had made observations of the UFO. Major Quintanilla explained
that we also felt that the observation was a balloon but confirmations
from someone (like the police department) is needed before we can
release a statement to the public that it was a balloon. Lt. Nielson
said he would check with the police but he wasn't sure
that he could get a confirmation. Lt. Nielson commented that NICAP
was on an NBC report. The NBC film report left no doubt that it was
a balloon for evidently this person had observed one go up the night
before. Major Quintanilla asked Lt. Nielson to call the lady in the
documentary and find out where she had gotten her confirmation. Lt.
Nielson didn't understand why he should get a confirmation from her
since the film left no doubt that it was a balloon. Major Quintanilla
explained that we needed a confirmation before we can release a statement
that the observation was a balloon. Captain Jensen then asked what
Major Quintanilla's job was and who he was connected with. Captain
Jensen also wanted to know who was interested in this. Major Quintanilla
informed him that it was Public at Safol that had had the inquiries
and that we must give them a statement. Captain Jensen said they would
try to get a confirmation. Lt. Nielson said that the sky was overcast
to 12,000 ft and the air was very still. Their extension is 4511.

At 0930, Major Quintanilla spoke with Mr. Jim Newton of Public Relations, SAPDI regarding this observation. Wanted to know if Public was still getting inquiries on this sighting. Public had gotten only two press inquiries, however Community relations had several. Major Quintanilla informed Mr. Newton that he had spoken with Andrews and wanted them to get us a confirmation. Major Quintanilla also informed Mr. Newton of the statement that was given in a news report that the observation was a balloon, and that Andrews was checking this out. Mr. Newton said the only release that they gave out was that the case is currently under investigation.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                   24 Aug 67

Subject:  UFO Reports, Wash DC area, 22 Aug 67

Lt Nielson of Andrews AFB, Ohio spoke with _______ garding additional information he had been able to gather on the sightings made in the Washington DC area on 22 August 67. Lt Nielson checked with the D.C. police department and Ellington police department. They were negative, no policement observed a UFO nor did anyone turn in a balloon. Lt. Nielson also talked to a private citizen and he told Lt Nielson that he was standing in downtown Georgetown and there was a policeman on the corner who was also watching this object. Lt Nielson has been unable to get in touch with the policeman, however, he comes on duty at 1pm and he will try to reach him then.

Lt Nielson also spoke with Lt Col Builta who is with the Scientific and Technical Division of DIA. Lt Col Builta said that based on everything he has seen and heard the object was most probably a surface balloon with some kind of light tied onto it.

I also asked Lt Nielson if everyone reported that the color was red and he said yes.

Lt. Nielson said that he had previously checked National Airport, which would have been in the area, to see if any of their pilots had observed the UFO. The tower said none observed the UFO. However, Lt. Nielson said he could personally check each airline if Major Quintanilla would want him to do so. I informed Lt Nielson that would call him back in approximately 1Â½ hours.

ATTN OF: W10/Lt Nielsen/4511                                   28 August 1967
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 22 August 1967, Washington, D.C.

TO:   TDET/UFO

1.   Reference is made to the message sent from this Headquarters, 23 August 1967, concerning subject sighting.

2.   An investigation conducted by the undersigned has failed to positively identify the object sighted over the Georgetown area of Washington, D.C. at 2200 hours (local) 22 August 1967.

3.   However, I was able to locate a Washington, D.C. policeman who said the object looked like a flare (red, railroad flare). At the time of the incident, he was observed on duty in the Georgetown area on 22 August 1967. He observed an object which he described as an intense red light. He said he could not see anything above or below the light. He first saw this light after noticing other groups of people looking up into the sky. The object made no sound. He said it was almost overhead and appeared to go up and out of sight. At the time of the sighting, he was standing on the corner of Wisconsin and Q Streets in the District.

4.   Criss stated that his first reaction to the object was that it was a flare. He also stated that another policeman told him he had seen the same object three nights in a row (21, 22 and 23 August 1967). I have not been able to locate the other policeman.

5.   I discussed with [redacted] the possibility of this object being the result of a prank. He said that was what he thought it was when he saw the object.

6.   I asked [redacted] to watch for the object to appear again and let me know. He said he would, and would also advise the other policemen in the Precinct.


- page 8 -

7. It is my opinion that the object sighted over Georgetown on 22 August 1967 was either a red light or a red flare attached to a large balloon released by someone as a hoax. I plan to take no further action unless the object reappears.
