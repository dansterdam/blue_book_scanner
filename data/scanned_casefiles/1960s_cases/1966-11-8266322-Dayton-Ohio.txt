11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a fuzzy or blurred object travel to-
ward the southeast at about ten minutes intervals.
The color was like a blue glowing light, like an
electric arc. The objects was moving, like the sun but
very fast. The objects flew in an eastern direction
at a high rate of speed in a straight line. The
observer only saw one in full view, rest of them
were just a blue arc. All of them did not come in the
same direction.

When I first saw the light I thought it was a plane landing. This was because it was much brighter than any stars. After watching it for a short while my wife and I both realized that it was not getting closer to the ground but higher in the sky. By the time it faded out it was almost directly overhead at what appeared to be a good distance away.

PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE OF OBS GROUP: 14 November 66 15/0340Z

2. LOCATION: Dayton, Ohio (4 Witnesses)

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: Northward

8. PHOTOS: [ ] Yes [X] No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [ ] Yes [X] No

10. CONCLUSION: Possible (AIRCRAFT)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched a star like object but seemed elongated in the direction of travel during the time it was in brightness. The light did not seem to be moving at a constant velocity, it appeared to increase and decrease in velocity or to change direction very slightly. The nearest comparison to this behavior is the apparent motion of the Echo balloon satellite, which one of the witnesses has seen several times, after its launch date, its velocity did not appear to be constant either.

The description is consistent with that of a satellite observation.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD IT BECAME BRIGHTER (MAYBE 3 OR 4 TIMES AS BRIGHT AS IT WAS BRIGHTEST SINCE) THEN BEGAN TO DIMINISH IN BRIGHTNESS AS IT MOVED ON PAST THE OVERHEAD POSITION, UNTIL IT FADED OUT COMPLETELY AT 20°TO 30° PAST THE VERTICAL POSITION.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

REGARDING MY ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD OF TIME THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE, THE FOLLOWING DETAILS ARE PERTINENT:

I HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE SCHOOL BUILDING INTO THE PARKING LOT WHEN I LOOKED UP AND THE SKY AND NOTICED A LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO BE MOVING. I WATCHED IT JUST COME ENOUGH TO BE VERY THAT IT WAS MOVING, AND THAT IT WAS NOT BLINKING. (IF IT WERE AN AIRPLANE, I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST ONE BLINKING LIGHT)

I THEN HURRIEDLY WENT BACK INSIDE AND ASKED SEVERAL PEOPLE STANDING AROUND IF THE COULD LINE TO SEE A UFO. I RUSHED BACK OUT AND BY THAT TIME THE LIGHT HAD BECOME MUCH BRIGHTER AND HAD MOVED FROM JUST TO THE LEFT OF THE CONSTELLATION ORION (WHICH WAS ABOUT 30° ABOVE THE HORIZON) TO ABOUT 60° ABOVE THE HORIZON, THE THREE MEN NAMED ABOVE FOLLOWED ME OUT AND THE FOUR OF US WATCHED IT UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED, WHICH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 1/2 TO 1 MINUTE AFTER THEY CAME OUTSIDE.

REGARDING THE ALTITUDE AND SPEED, THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS SEEM PERTINENT:

THE LIGHT DID NOT SEEM TO BE MOVING AT A CONSTANT VELOCITY, IT APPEARED TO INCREASE AND DECREASE IN VELOCITY, OR TO CHANGE DIRECTION VERY SLIGHTLY (SORT OF JUMP ALONG). THE NEAREST COMPARISON TO THIS BEHAVIOR (OR APPARENT BEHAVIOR) IS THE APPARENT MOTION OF THE ECHO BALLOON SATELLITE, WHICH I WATCHED A COUPLE OF TIMES SOON AFTER IT WAS PLACED IN ORBIT. — ITS VELOCITY DID NOT APPEAR CONSTANT EITHER. I SUPPOSE THIS IS DUE TO TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH DEFRACT THE LIGHT DIFFERENTLY AS THE OBJECT MOVES. I WOULD JUDGE THAT THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE TO BE QUITE HIGH FOR THIS EFFECT TO BE OBSERVABLE, AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE OBSERVED AT SO MANY ALTITUDES, IN THIS TIME OBSERVED, ITS VELOCITY MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE HIGH.

Observer noted a cluster of white lights that traveled toward the east. As it traveled away the white light cluster faded then began to appear as a red steady glow then finally as a red dull pulsating light. The object was to far away to define the shape other than as a cluster of lights.

Contact was made with MP AFS operations but they had no traffic departing the base at 0400Z 18 Nov. 66

22 Nov. 66

Contact was made with WP AFB operations regarding the observence of an alleged UFO over the Dayton area on 18 Nov. 66 at approximately 2300. There were two aircraft which landed at the base shortly before the time of the sighting. There was no traffic leaving the base at the time of the sighting. Description is consistent with that of an aircraft which would be in a slowly rising after take off pattern. It is possible that the observer saw one of these two aircraft in a landing pattern. Both aircraft were of the DC-6 class.
