MEMO FOR RECORD:

At approximately 0830, had a phone call from Major Wilson, SAFLL, Lt. 5735. He stated that at a retirement party last evening for one of the L&L officers, Congressman Schwiker, 13th District of Pennsylvania, wanted to know about a UFO sighting that allegedly took place in the Congressman's home district on the evening of 28 July 1968.

Called Wright-Patterson; they had nothing on it, but called Benton AFS, the nearest base to the Congressman's home district (Worcester, Montgomery Co., Pa.). Benton had no report, but told Wright-Pat that Capt. Underwood, the local UFO investigator (Area Code 717 - H(7-5910)) would be glad to investigate if one of the eye witnesses would report it.

At 1040, called Major Wilson, SAFLL, and gave him the above information. He planned to relay it to the Congressman.

Dear Hector:

Reference the August 2, 1968, letter to you from Mr. [redacted], Editor, POTTSTOWN (Pennsylvania) MERCURY (copy attached). What was the nature of the "mickey mouse treatment" he received from McGuire Air Force Base?

Would appreciate a rundown as to whom he contacted, when, and what happened. If an official Air Force apology is called for, we will take action to have one made. We would first, however, have to have a few more details of what transpired before Mr. [redacted]'s August 2 letter.

Sincerely,

I have absolutely no proof, except [redacted]'s allegations, that he received "the mickey mouse treatment" from McGuire AFB. The memo which he received from McGuire does not indicate that he received undue or harsh treatment. However, he appears to be perturbed by the fact that the duty officer couldn't specifically identify the light to which he referred to. According to AF regulations, UFO investigators do not have to submit reports of moving lights at or near airports. It appears that the duty officer failed to satisfy [redacted] or his reporter, and evidently this too, has perturbed him to some extent. I probably used the wrong word when I said that McGuire had acted in an unprofessional manner. I probably should have said that McGuire was derelict in not being able to satisfy an inquisitive reporter, but then who can. After thinking about this at length, I'm not too sure that [redacted] really deserves an apology. However, I think it appropriate that we acknowledge his letter addressed to me, but then what do I really gain in such a report - any suggestions?

Proposed reply

Dear [redacted]

This replies to your letter of August 2, 1968. On behalf of the Air Force, let me apologize for the unprofessional manner in which your case was handled by McGuire AFB. Your letter has been forwarded to McGuire AFB for corrective and appropriate action.

POTTSTOWN MERCURY
Aug. 2, 1968

Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla
Chi., Aerial Phenomena Office
Wr. -Patterson AFB, Ohio:

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

In reference to your request for more information concerning an unidentified flying object which I observed.

I feel that if my name in transmission from Benton Air Force Station, Pa., to Wright-Patterson is changed from [redacted] to [redacted] and my newspaper's address from [redacted] and the [redacted] street that any data which I might supply to the Air Force would become foul up.

My sighting, incidentally, was not reported to the Air Force for numerous telephone calls The Mercury received.

Because of a Mickey Mouse treatment The Mercury received from the Air Force at Maguire AFB, I contacted Congressman Richard S. Schwelker who put me in touch with Capt. Jesse Underwood at Benton.

Capt. Underwood became the First Air Force Officer who showed courtesy and also investigative ability. My purpose in contacting him was not to explain my sightings, but because he was obviously capable I explained that I, too, observed a UFO and explained because of its actions I did not believe that it was a conventional craft. I explained that I was familiar with the patterns of air craft and knew that they fly in different level zones. Private planes low, passenger crafts higher and Air Force bombers, etc. at the highest level. I outlined that what I observed was nothing like any craft that I previously observed. I told him all the information he requested.


- page 9 -

POTTSTOWN MERCURY
(2)

I spent a good half hour explaining to Capt. Underwood the details of the craft I observed.

In a nutshell, what I did observe was not a conventional aircraft. If weather balloons are lighted and have lights that flare and change color and are able to change directions in a manner totally unacceptable to planes then it is possible that I observed a weather balloon. The wind at ground level was blowing toward the southwest and the craft was traveling against the wind, however, I assume that wind at a higher level could be different than that at a low level. I also assume that the craft could have been hit by a sudden frontal system which caused its erratic movements. I assume this, but don't really believe it.

I would fill out your form if I thought for a minute that it would help. But I don't.

My own philosophy is against belief in UFOs as outlined in the attached column written by me. But recently I have had doubts.

Too many people have seen too many things too suddenly for me to accept a mass hysteria theory.

I now am inclined to believe that there is something up there but I wouldn't hazard a guess to what it is.

Again, I appreciate the courtesy that Capt. Underwood showed me. I feel he was the only representative of the Air Force who acted like what an Air Force office should represent.

If you feel I can be of any concrete help, please feel free to contact me.

Cordially

STATEMENT

RE: UFO SIGHTING REPORTS DURING 1600 - 2300 SHIFT 28 JULY 1968.
WX - Clear- dry- cool. VIS 100 miles horizontal and unlimited vertically. Wind west to northwest 6 kts surface and 90 kts at 40,000 feet.

First UFO call from man in Trenton who saw a light between Trenton and Willingboro - seemed to be moving slowly and erratically. No shape - substance - sound. Said it couldn't have been Echo Satellite because he had helped build it. Told him I had no idea what it was but would call around and thanks for the call. Time 2145L

NOTE: No report made as a light doesn't constitute a UFO - AFR 80-17.

ACTION: Went to WX and asked if north Philadelphia or Willow Grove put up WX balloons. Answer - didn't think so. Called Philadelphia FSS and asked him to call WX (Grove re WX balloon). Answer, negative.

Second UFO call from man in Asbury Park - been at the beach with friends, flew B-29 during war - thought it would never happen.

Q. What did you see?
A. Lights - one going north and one going south.

Q. What did you see behind the light?
A. Nothing. Never thought it would happen.

Said I didn't know what it was but would report it and thanks for the call. Time: 2215L

Third UFO call from man in Trenton who made first call. Light is now circling near the moon. Have you found out what it is yet? My answer negative but think I will go out and look myself.

ACTION: Told dispatcher I was going to roof, took binoculars, went to roof, couldn't find moon, scanned sky, saw about 30 planes, stars were twinkling brightly various colors, climbed down. Time: 2300L

Fourth call - Lady in Willingboro not satisfied with dispatcher explanation. Her concern was that Air Force Colonel next door had said she should complete a written UFO Report of her light sighting. I assured her that her report was duly noted. Time: 2320L

Fifth call - Noticed that the dispatcher completely out of words on the telephone - took over call - do not have name of caller. Caller identified himself as a reporter for the Pottstown Mercury - said his boss wanted an answer for the light reported over Pottstown. I said I didn't have an answer. Had had many calls from New Jersey

Here is the OCR text from the document:

about the same light. He wanted to know what I did about these calls. 
I explained that we were not forwarding reports of lights, but were 
trying to concentrate on the shape or substance carrying the light. 
He asked why we didn't investigate lights. I answered that we get 
hundreds of calls about lights but seldom received useful information 
about what carried the light. He asked if he could use my name and I 
said no. Time: 234OL

COMMENTS REGARDING [REDACTED]: I do not believe I ever spoke to 
[REDACTED]. I did not state that Mr. [REDACTED] or his reporter had a little 
too much to drink causing him to see things. I have never chided a 
UFO caller in any fashion.

I believe the gentleman is rankled because I could not identify the 
light and wasn't planning to report it.

COMMENTS ON CURRENT UFO REPORTING:

The Base Operations Duty Officer at McGuire Air Force Base is helpless 
to investigate and consequently identify a light over Pottstown Penna. 
The person who should take a call and investigate a light is a man in 
Pottstown, located and appointed by the Mayor of Pottstown and equipped 
with a sighting instrument and a night camera. A citizen of Pottstown 
could call the Pottstown Police who have a list of these UFO investi-
gators by town sector. The police could then pass the phone number to 
the sighter who could then call direct to an appointed, equipped, and 
possibly trained local citizen who could meet with the sighter and pos-
sibly come up with an answer.

The current procedure of calling the nearest Air Force Base is expensive 
of time and money and useless as an investigative program.

A Different Slant
By ROBERT J. BOYLE

Dr. Gerald Feinberg
And Flying Saucers

The letter has gone from flying saucers, maybe because they're being overplayed lately, maybe it's because most men of science don't put much stock in them, or, maybe people are getting used to far-out tales.

Now you can sit down in any small town you can see old lights that go away, dim, or new lights that just stand still.

Most people have a sort of cosmic and lay probably are.

Most hard-nosed imaginative and stranger deaths to the saucer business.

The more a person reads about UFOs the more he is convinced that they exist, but are coming from outer space. They're helicopter lights, swamp gas, clouds or practical jokes.

The lights may even be the particles that Dr. Gerald Feinberg is talking about.

In 1966, when Einstein's theory of relativity was being tested, he made a conclusion that velocities greater than the speed of light have no possibility of existence.

While parts of the theory of relativity have been challenged, and most physicists follow the conclusion that velocities greater than the speed of light have no possibility of existence.

There was a disagreement, that is, little rest.

Then, Dr. Feinberg, professor of physics at Columbia University, suggested that the particles traveling faster than light is some cases almost impossible to believe.

Although a Princeton university team was unable to find any of the predicted particles, Dr. Feinberg is not discouraged. He may only mean, he said, that the particles have no electrical charge.

Ordinary matter loses energy as it increases in speed. Dr. Feinberg suggests that in space particles lose energy faster than Einstein predicted.

One of the more interesting aspects of the space problem is that if one of the basic tenets of modern physics, as taught by Einstein, is that there is no way to transmit energy from one point to another at any speed faster than the speed of light.

According to this theory, it would take quite 100,000 years for a signal on the far side of the Milky Way galaxy, to which this planet belongs, to reach observers here. It would take travelers far longer to make this trip.

But all this would be changed if the Feinberg theory is accepted. Speed, then would become unlimited.

Other physicists are working to prove the basic postulates of the theory.

If the theory is accepted, it would be the most exciting development in the world of science in the last half of the century.

One school holds that Feinberg's theory could, in some cases be responsible for the UFO sightings.

His particles, they believe, would show up as light as they lose energy surpassing the speed of light.

But then comes the puzzler, if they surpass light's speed, would they show light and if they did would the light slow down to its accepted speed of 135,000 miles per second?

If light is given off by the particles, would the light itself be traveling faster than the speed of light?

Saucer proponents see a ray of hope for their theory in Feinberg's proposal.

If the energy being lost by the particles could be harnessed as a means of propulsion, then it would be possible to reduce the time of travel in space from the accepted limits to on infinite speed.

Saucer believers like to imagine that there is an advanced civilization somewhere out there. This civilization, they hope, is able to achieve in space travel what we have just begun.

Scientists agree that in this galaxy alone there are thousands of planets which can harbor life to that of earth and would be able to support life.

And there are untold numbers of galaxies.

And, although it is likely that there are planets like ours, there is one big flaw in the flying saucer theory.

If there was a saucer civilization as far advanced as saucer believers believe, why doesn't it just pick up a super space phone and contact us?

An advanced form of life surely wouldn't go zipping around a foreign planet for 20 years or more and never make any attempt at contacting us.

That would be like Columbus coming to the new world and not landing. He would have stayed off shore licking lanterns on and off.

Some saucer believers claim that contacts have been made but they haven't been any to anyone who amounts to a pot of beans.

The first thing Jack Armstrong used to do when he met an unfriendly tribe was to seek out the chief or the medicine man.

Why would saucer occupant pilots seek out the Indians and not the chiefs?

Another debit of the saucer theory is the lack of actual contact by the military. The U.S. military is able to tell if Red China drops a type firecracker in the Peking water works. But with all its sophisticated gadgets, including cameras that can photograph a frog hair at 250 miles away, the government has yet to come up with a single incident that would prove the existence of saucers.

Some sighting reports haven't been explained but lack of an explanation doesn't constitute proof.

I'd like to believe in saucers because they would add an air of excitement and mystery to life but until something more positively comes along, I'm putting my sky watcher's badge away.

Subj: UFO Observation, 28 Jul 63, Wooster (Montgomery County) Pa

called on the morning of 30 Jul 63 and said that SAFLL had a phone call from regarding a UFO observation that occurred practically in his backyard and wanted to know what the Air Force had done about it. The only information had provided was that the sighting occurred on Sunday night, 28 Jul in Wooster, Pa, Montgomery County. Mrs then called Capt Underwood, 477-5910 (comm number) at Benton AFS, Pennsylvania to see if they had received any reports. Capt Underwood checked and they had not received any reports, however, he would be on the lookout and call us if he did receive the report. Mrs at 1045, 30 Jul 63 that Benton AFS, Pa had not received any UFO reports for the night of 28 Jul 63 and that if the witness wished to report his observation he may do so by contacting Capt Underwood at Benton AFS.

On 31 Jul 63 at approximately 1500 hours, Capt Underwood spoke with Lt Marano regarding the observation of 28 Jul 68. Capt Underwood had just received a telephone call from of Pottstown Pa who observed an UFO on Sun night, 28 Jul 63. The gentleman admitted that he had called in regards to the sighting. had originally called the Duty Officer at McGuire and when he called the Duty Officer gave a sarcastic answer that he had been drinking too much. He thought the Duty Officer's name was. He then called then called

said that we would have to submit a formal letter stating the allegations
and our fulfillment requirements. I told Col DeGore that I felt that
an informal reply would be sufficient.
