The witness who saw the object was in the home of a friend at about 2100 hours on 26 Aug 65 when he noticed an unusual light in the sky through a window. He went outside and saw a very large object, illuminated and egg-shaped, which was observed for about 30 minutes. The object did not move and remained stationary, though the witness could see that there was some activity or movement within the object, which he described as a "pulsing effect" while he was watching it. No sound was heard. The witness stated that the object was much larger than a normal aircraft and that it appeared to be hovering. He felt that this was no aircraft that he had ever seen before. He reported the incident to the Ministry of Defence.

Carlisle, Whitehafen,

13 Aug 65

Mr. R. W. Phillips, a teacher in a local school, was driving home at night when he saw a large number of lights in the sky. After watching them for some time, he estimated there were about 20-30 objects, bright white in color, and moving very fast in a north-easterly direction. They were arranged in a v-shaped formation, and then broke up into a scattered pattern. The whole incident lasted about 30-45 seconds, according to Mr. Phillips' estimate.
The case was reported to the local press, whose report stated that the objects were observed by several witnesses. The press expressed the view that the same objects had been reported in other parts of the country, and that some explanation might be found for the sighting. However, no explanation was offered by any official source.

The text of the document is as follows:

LITTLE MEN SEEN IN WASHINGTON STATE: Two girls living in Renton, Washington, on August 6, reported they had seen three non-human men, about five feet tall, who appeared to be wearing some kind of strange dress - tight-fitting white-domed heads, and protruding eyes of the individuals. The arms had no expression, the eyes were gray like stars, and the bodies had a luminous quality. The necked dresses with white shirts underneath. The girls leave from their home about fifteen feet, and when they looked back the three beings had disappeared. No sound was seen in connection with this strange incident.

The text reads as follows:

PENNSYLVANIA PILOT CHASES UFO: An interesting article dated August 13th tells of a western pilot who was flying from Kennedy International Airport when he spotted what he described as a "strange object" he was chasing. The object was said to be travelling "straight toward the object". He was within about five miles of the object when he lost sight of it. The object then suddenly disappeared from sight. Hoffman told newsmen that he was unable to close the gap between his plane and the object, which was a cut of sight within a matter of seconds. Hoffman is the owner and operator of the Shamokln Flying Service. At Shamokln, Pa.: He has been flying since 1934, and is known to be a stable and reliable person.

UFO REPORT 
UFO SIGHTING - 8/12/65

WITNESSES: Mr. Leonard R. Mitchell 
Ms. Donald R. O'Leary
Mr. Mast Lyons, Massachusetts
Ms. Jennett Mason, Massachusetts 
Ms. Margaret Johnson, Trotwood, Ohio

DATE: 13 August 1965
PLACE: Hassen Baking Corporation, 318 Brookline Street, Lexington, Massachusetts

BACKGROUND: The witnesses stated that the object was observed by them as they arrived at the Hassen Baking Corporation. 

SIGHTING ACCOUNT: 
Donald C. O'Leary was leaving the sky church at the time the object was sighted. He observed a large silver metallic object hovering in the sky. He estimated the object to be approximately 100 feet in diameter. The object did not make any sound and appeared to be motionless. After a few minutes, the object moved swiftly to the northwest at a tremendous rate of speed.

EVALUATION: It seems that the apparent size of the object was probably exaggerated but beyond that, the details given by the witnesses appear to be generally accurate. The object was seen by multiple reliable witnesses and exhibited characteristics typical of many UFO sightings. Therefore, this sighting is considered to be of significant interest.

CONCLUSION: The object was probably a legitimate UFO, though its exact nature remains uncertain.

UFO REPORTS

DATE: 7 September 1965
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler
CHAIRMAN: HICAP Massachusetts Subcommittee

TO: HICAP

Enclosed are a number of UFO Reports investigated by the HICAP Massachusetts Investigating Subcommittee. Over 40 UFO Reports were received by this subcommittee between early July and mid-August.

The majority of these reports were evaluated and found to be a local advertising plane, Echo I & II transits, aircraft seen under unusual lighting conditions and even a large kite carrying a red flare. Other reports were rejected because of insufficient data, witnesses refusing to cooperate and because of our limited resources to investigate reports at a great distance from us entailing travel. Out-of-state reports were completely ignored.

There were several good sightings during this period. Some reports have already been forwarded to HICAP, some are enclosed, and hopefully others will follow. A sample of the identified UFO reports are enclosed. Many of this type never reached the written stage as it would have been just a waste of time.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
HICAP Investigator

SCOTLAND
The following account comes from a letter to the Flying Saucer Review, dated September 6, we read of the unusual experience of a Mrs. Mears, who was on holiday in Scotland with her husband on 2 August 1965. The letter states:
"On this date, while driving along the A84 road between Stirling and Callander, my husband and I could hardly believe our eyes - at a point in the road not far from Stirling, we saw a small metallic-looking object hovering a few feet above the ground. It was shaped rather like a plate, and gleamed in the sunlight. We stopped the car and watched it for about 10 minutes or more. It appeared to rotate slowly, and all of a sudden it shot upwards at an unbelievable speed and disappeared from sight. My husband and I could hardly believe what we had seen, it was such an unusual occurrence."

The article discusses sightings of unusual objects near the Canberra Airport in Australia, and mentions that air traffic control officers and other officials were puzzled by the sighting. The article also notes that the sighting had prompted an investigation by the authorities.

Transcription of the text in the document:

MARTIANS WATCHING AUSTRALIA?
Canberra, Australia. - (AP) - Officials at Canberra's Airport reported seeing strange objects in the sky. They said the objects appeared to be saucer-shaped and were described as moving at tremendous speeds. 
Air traffic control officers and other officials at the airport said they watched the objects for some time and were puzzled by what they saw. It appeared to officials that the objects were under intelligent control. 
Canberra tracking station recorded the objects on its screens. Police were called to the airport to investigate the sightings. It is reported that some of the tracking station personnel saw the objects with the naked eye.

15 AUG 65
Windmore Green, England

Windmore Green, Appleby, near Carlisle, Cumberland. On 15 August at about 4 a.m. a strange object was seen passing over. Mrs Lorna Ellwood, who resides about 15 miles north of Appleby, states that the object was spherical in shape, emitting a bright light, and that it was travelling very fast in a westerly direction. She described it as a very strange "washing-beam" in appearance. The incident was mentioned to the local police who considered it "worth investigating," but they apparently did not visit the spot or take any official notice of the report. Later in the day Mrs. Ellwood was again watching the object, which seemed to be hovering in the sky near her home. Her daughter also saw it. Then again we have a report from the Isle of Man.

On the night of 16 August at about 10 p.m. Miss Mary Young, a resident of Douglas, saw an object which appeared to be a large balloon or an airship passing over the middle of the island from north to south. She watched it for about 3/4 hour as it drifted southwards. It appeared to be elongated in shape and to have a number of lights. Some of the lights were pulsating. 
I know about the Longshaws, and this incident but the details I gave were wrong. Firstly, it was Mrs. Lorna Ellwood who saw the object, not Miss Eltwood. Secondly, the object was seen over Windmore Green, not Appleby. The police were informed but did not visit the spot or take any official notice of the report. Mrs. Ellwood saw the object again later in the day, as did her daughter. The report from the Isle of Man was on the night of 16 August, not 15 August. The witness there was Miss Mary Young, not Mrs. Young. The object was described as being elongated in shape and having a number of pulsating lights. It drifted southwards over the middle of the island for about 3/4 hour.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

Gentlemen:

I recently visited my son, his wife and their child in-law and found the visit to be particularly interesting because it gave me a chance to meet my daughter-in-law and to observe certain phenomena which she had not seen before.

My son's wife told me that she had seen something rather strange in the sky, which she did not understand, sometime before my visit. She did not report it to anyone but friends and family. She did not know what it was.

Her name is XXXXX. XXXXX, Colorado.

The date of the sighting was between the 15th and 20th of August, 1966, sometime between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 midnight. She and her brother were in the car, she was driving, her brother was in the passenger seat, when they noticed something strange in the sky. It was about 3:30 p.m. and the night was clear with the moon. 

Joe saw the UFO first as he was gazing out the window and it appeared suddenly. It was white in color and seemed larger than a plane and lower than a plane. It was brighter than the stars and appeared to be solid. The object was cigar-shaped with a glow around it. It seemed to be hovering or very slowly moving. It was between 500 yards and 1 mile from their car. The object was stationary and was not a shadow but a glow. The object seemed to be projecting rather than part of or a shadow. This object was silent and did not have any lights such as would be on an airplane. It had no sound and did not appear to be moving in any direction. It just seemed to be hovering or sitting. After a short time, it simply disappeared.

The image contains a photograph showing a sketch or drawing of a UFO-like object. The text describes the object as being "shaped something like this" and includes a hand-drawn illustration of the object.

When they called attention to it, she stopped the car and they watched it. The car was not affected. It was in their view about a minute and a half when they became aware of it. They never reported this sighting except to friends who probably thought they were being foolish.

She went to Brighton Junior High. St. Mary of Springfield High School from whom she graduated, worked in Denver Colorado before marriage. Her brother goes to school in Brighton.
