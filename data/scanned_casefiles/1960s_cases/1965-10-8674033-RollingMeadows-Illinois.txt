Dear Sir,

I am sending my version of the sighting of the U.F.O.'s as you requested I do, in writing.

October 28, 1965

I was driving south on Joy lane at about 12:25 in the afternoon. I came to Central road and stopped. I looked to the right and as I started to look to the left I saw 2 objects in the sky straight ahead, but at approximately a 50 angle. The objects were in the southern part of the sky. They didn't appear to be moving, they looked like two minute moons (the way the moon shines at night), they were about the size of a silver dollar; they didn't move one way or another, just hyed, seem like the moon. I watched for several seconds amazed at the sight, then the objects became flat like a line in the sky. I don't remember seeing them maneuver in any way except that they just turning into that line. Then I believe they started moving. I'm not sure because when the glare turned into haze I decided to drive home to see them better from my windows which are on the golf links.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

10/28/66
page 1

When I got home I found that my window faced the wrong direction so I alone back to the place I had seen there. The sky was clear, no objects were present and although I looked for a few minutes I couldn't see anything anywhere on the sky.

So I came back home very disappointed.

When the globes turned into lines they didn't glow but looked like gray metal. There was no dome on the top like the so-called flying saucers.
on side                                                as they became lines

I wasn't going to report it but then decided that it was almost my civic duty to do so. I would rather have not gotten involved at all- but it was so unusual a sight that I guess I had to. I had no camera or telescope with me in the car. I swear that all I saw reported in this letter is the truth, and I have 20-20 vision.

(cont'd)

Note: There are also two small hand-drawn circles with "glowing" written inside them, and two elongated shapes representing the transformation of the objects from globes to lines.


- page 16 -

P.S. During the whole sighting a jet was rising shooting to the far left of the objects, the jet was moving up in the general direction of the objects that the objects turned into them below and I think started to move further south. I remember thinking that the jet had seen the objects and was going up to investigate them. While this fact is valuable to you or not, I don't know. If I can be of further help, please let me know.
