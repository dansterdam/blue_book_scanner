9. FURTHER DETAILS OF SIGHTING
Object was observed to be moving auto-
matically and disappeared into a cloud.
Object appeared as a pinpoint, then in-
creased in size and disappeared as sud-
denly as it appeared. No trail or vapor
trail was observed. The object appeared
solid. Fuzzy as blurred, irregular
shape and appeared to be observed at great
distance. The moon would have been in
the position to be reflecting light and
the possibility of refraction of the
moon.
10. CONCLUSIONS:
WERE THEY:
D Natural
D Probably Balloon
D Possibly Balloon
D Possibly Aircraft
D Insufficient Data
OTHER:
Insufficient data to evaluate. The
object could not be identified at the
time. The apparent movement, sudden
appearing and disappearing, was more
likely the result of atmospheric condi-
tions acting upon the reflected light
of the moon rather than an actual physical
object.

The image appears to contain three hand-drawn sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on it. The second and third sketches depict a road or street scene with trees and buildings in the background, and a small person figure in the foreground.

OCR output:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
