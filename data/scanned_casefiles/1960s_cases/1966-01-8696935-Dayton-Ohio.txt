Cincinnati 36, Ohio

Dear [redacted]:

On 4 January a satellite, ECHO I, passed North of Cincinnati at 52 degrees elevation heading Southeast. This placed the satellite path in the area which you observed. The description contained in the form which you turned to us today is consistent with a satellite sighting. Unfortunately, ECHO I and ECHO II were not visible during the evening hours from 25 to 31 January from Cincinnati.

ECHO II will pass South of Cincinnati on 23 January at 5:00 AM at 30 degrees elevation moving Northeast; at 06.37 at Jan 29 degrees above horizon moving NW; at 06.13 AM Jan 29 South of city, 63 degrees above horizon moving NE; at 05.13 AM Jan 30 South of city, 23 degrees above horizon moving NE; at 05.49 AM Jan 31 South of city, 57 degrees above horizon moving NE.

Your observation was extremely accurate in reporting the time motion sequence and the estimated duration. We wish to thank you for replying to our letter requesting additional information.

In the future, should you observe an object which you cannot identify, it is not necessary for you to call us on your own expense. The Duty Officer at the Foreign Technology Division is authorized to receive collect telephone calls in this regard.
