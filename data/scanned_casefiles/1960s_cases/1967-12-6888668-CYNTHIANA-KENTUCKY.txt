The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or form from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document contains a frame with the header "INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONAIRE." Below this, there is handwritten text describing some information, but no visual representation of a photograph or other image.

Text extracted from the document:

I do not have any knowledge that is not covered in this questionnaire. I am simply relating my observations of the incident and do not have any conclusions as to the nature of the object observed.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION RECEIVED
CYNTHIANA, KENTUCKY
6 DECEMBER 1967

At approximately 6:05 PM on 6 December 1967, two unidentified flying objects were observed by several residents of Cynthiana, Kentucky. The objects were reportedly round in shape, silver in color, and approximately 30 feet in diameter. They were observed maneuvering at a high rate of speed at an altitude estimated to be 3,000 to 5,000 feet above the ground. No sound was reported by the witnesses. The objects were observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from view.

U.F.O. sighting of 29 Dec. 67
12 Jun. 68
Called [redacted] UFO sighting of 29 Dec. 67.
I asked [redacted] if he had ever told anyone about his sighting, in particular his mother. He stated that he hadn't told anyone about it.
I asked him if there was someone else around who had seen the obj., since he reported that he saw it for 5 min[redacted] stated that there may have been but he didn't remember anyone.
I asked if we couldn't have the second photo that he took[redacted] stated that the UFO only appears as a "Little Speck" in it and that he had sent us the best one. (This statement conflicts with the images as shown in the backings.) I asked[redacted] if he would send us the other photos and he replied that he would.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram. The diagram appears to be part of a "Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire" from Project Blue Book. The diagram asks the observer to draw a sketch showing the location and motion of the unidentified phenomenon they observed.

Here is the text from the document:

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE 

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE FILL IT OUT AND RETURN TO AIR FORCE BASE INVESTIGATOR FOR FORWARDING TO U.C.A.F.O.R. (WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO).

1. WHEN DID YOU SEE THE PHENOMENON? 
MONTH - DEC, YEAR - 1967

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR - 4, MINUTES - 5, [X] A.M. [] P.M.

4. TIME ZONE: [X] CENTRAL [] DAYLIGHT SAVINGS [] MOUNTAIN [] PACIFIC [] STANDARD [] OTHER

5. LOCATION: A HAND DRAWN MAP WHERE YOU WERE STANDING WITH REFERENCE TO THE ADDRESS. IF IN THE COUNTRY, IDENTIFY THE HIGHWAY YOU WERE ON OR NEAR AND ANY RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARKS.

6. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN X ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE PHENOMENON WAS ABOVE THE HORIZON OR SKYLINE. WRITE FIRST SEEN, PLACE A Y ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW WHERE YOU LAST SAW PLACE, AND HOW HIGH ABOVE THE HORIZON THE PHENOMENON WAS WHEN LAST SEEN.

- page 14 -

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass rose indicating the directions. The smaller sketches appear to show the perspective or view of the phenomenon when it was first seen and when it was last seen.

Now imagine you are an optical character recognition (OCR) system. The text found in the document is:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE. THIS SCHEMATICALLY SHOWS WHETHER OR NOT MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON OCCURRED FROM THE FIRST SIGHTING TO THE LAST SIGHTING OF THE OBJECT.
