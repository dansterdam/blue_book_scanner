    SIGHTING: (HOAX)
    PHOTO: SMALL MAN MADE OBJECT

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
    The observer stated; sighted and photographed a UFO. The object appeared solid and reflected light. He also stated that his neighbors dog was howling.

    COMMENTS: The observer stated that he reads all he can about UFOs. Although the object was seen for 5 minutes during the daylight, no one else from the area reported any similar objects and the observer made no efforts to call it to the attention of anyone else. The observer stated that he has two photos of the object. As proof he submitted two polaroid backings and one polaroid print. When requested to submit the other photo he replied that the UFO appears as a "little speck" in it and he had sent us the best one. This conflicts with the images as shown in the polaroid backings.

The object went straight up at a speed I do not know - I did not tell any other white - this because they might think I'm crazy. I am only sending one photo - the other is unobtainable.

UFO sighting of 29 Dec. 67

12 Jun. 68

Called [redacted] UFO sighting of 29 Dec. 67.

I asked [redacted] if he had ever told anyone about his sighting, in particular his mother. He stated that he hadn't told anyone about it.

I asked him if there was someone else around who had seen the obj., since he reported that he saw it for 5 min[redacted]. He stated that there may have been but he didn't remember anyone.

I asked if we couldn't have the second photo that he took[redacted]. He stated that the UFO only appears as a "little Speck" in it and that he had sent us the best one. (This statement conflicts with the images as shown in the backings.) I asked [redacted] if he would send us the other photo and he replied that he would.
