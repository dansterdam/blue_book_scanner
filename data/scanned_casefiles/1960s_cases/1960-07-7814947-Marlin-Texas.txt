10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
[Text partially illegible, but appears to describe a white light/object moving in the sky]

11. COMMENTS
Winds from SE or a balloon. Probably KWTX radio flight. This conclusion is insufficient. Speed and flight pattern are consistent as are the white lights. No other lights should have been seen and it must have been a light aircraft. Case listed as insufficient date due to lack of supporting information.
