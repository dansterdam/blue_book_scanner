Dear Mr.

The object which you observed on the night of 22 July 1965 is regarded as probable aircraft observation. It is similar to other reports received at Project Blue Book of known aircraft. At this late date, it is impossible to attempt specific identification. Many aircraft are observed at night and appear only as a single light.

The attached report on Project Blue Book gives the information which you requested on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

Dear Sirs,

I am writing to you about a flying saucer report.
It was on the night of the 22d of July, the time was 9:30,
I was looking into the sky for something but I had no luck.
Later some of my pals came out and looked with me.
We looked at the Big Dipper and saw nothing, then looked
again and saw the object. It was round, disc shaped, and
a yellowish tint to it.
It did not blink like an airplane so I think that was out.
I am not sure if it was a balloon, I doubt it.
The direction it went was so east and then it went
to the north and then to the northeast where it finally
disappeared.
All of this took place in a minute or two.
I am very interested in this subject, please could you
send me a some information on it.

Sincerely Yours
