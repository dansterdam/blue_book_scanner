34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 19 Sep 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire as a narrative explanation of your sighting:
The object was brightly lit and appeared to be a perfect semicircle. There was a blinking red light on the bottom. It hovered over the trees at a tree-top level and then suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared in the distant haze. It seemed to be quite close to the observer, perhaps a quarter of a mile away, and was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object appeared to be metallic and very smooth. It made no sound at all and there was no visible exhaust or propulsion system. The sighting occurred in a mountainous, forested area with very little light or ground clutter. The weather was clear and calm at the time. The observer was quite certain that this was no known aircraft or other familiar object.
