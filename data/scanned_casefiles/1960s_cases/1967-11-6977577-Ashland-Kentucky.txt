Ramey Home Residents
Sight 'Objects In Sky'

The second sighting of "objects in the sky" was reported Monday night - this time by Miss Gertrude Ramey, founder and superintendent of the Ramey Children's Home, and about 14 of the home's residents.

The "thing," described as silver in color and much larger than a star, appeared first over the Ramey and from it came smaller objects.

Miss Ainel Effingham, a student at Ashland Community College, said she and the other youngsters - all high school college age - watched the unidentified flying objects from about 8:30 until nearly 10 p.m.

Miss Ramey said the bitter cold kept her inside most of the time but she did make several trips outside to watch the objects. Jokingly, this morning she said, "If they land and want to be taken to our leader, I'm going to send them to The Independent to see Bob McCullough," The Independent and on the Ramey Home board of directors.

Miss Effingham, who said she had "never seen anything like it," said the large object would get red, dim, disappear and then reappear. The 11 smaller objects stayed silvery in color and in formations of about three to a group and would disappear when the large one did.

The children have a large telescope and used it last night but the only thing it would pick up was white flashes of light, she said.

The ACC sophomore said she "stood there with my mouth open" as the objects would hover, move off and return. "There was no motor sound and they traveled extremely (Continued on Page 18, Column 1)

Ramey Home
(Continued From Page One)

Miss Effingham said the formations didn't take off but just dimmed and disappeared. "There may be some explanation, but I don't quite understand it," she said, adding that there was not much sleep last night for the watchers who saw the phenomena.

Several miles from the Ramey Home, and about the same time the children were watching the sky, Ashland Patrolman Roger Gusler and Clyde Trimble were stationed at the water tower with high-powered glasses.

Gusler, who reported seeing objects in the east-southeast Sunday night, said he and Trimble did not see anything except several "shooting stars" and airplanes during their 2½-hour vigil.

The patrolman said "the view is beautiful, you can see all around," but none of the objects he watched for, nearly three hours Sunday night were seen. The tower is located off Mt. 58 which joins the entrance to I-64 and he and Trimble called it off about 10 p. m., he said.

If You Have any Information on tracking UFO's send it me and I'll try to Help You Guys out 19 I can Invite a high power telescope

My friend and I was in my yard the night of Nov. 28 down sighted an UFO near flying North from the town of Ashland Ky (were live) toward a small town called Summit. We watched it till it went out of sight with a pair of Binoculars and telescope and is performing (was 11 PM) up now it came close with a small craft behind it. they were a gold ash color. We were not the only one who sighted this as you can see in the article I have enclosed. If we had internet of 1 PM we could have took films of them. I would advise you to set up a station to look for UFOs because there is always there is a UFO flying over this town seems like this is a main cross road to them.

Police Officer Sees Flying Saucers

Police officers in Ashland have for years been receiving calls about unidentified flying objects. Now, one of the police officers has reported seeing them.

A previously skeptical Patrohman Roger Gustin, who was himself "on the lookout" for flying saucers last Sunday night, saw four or five for nearly three hours Sunday night.

"And I wasn't just seeing things," he said. "I was so strikingly obvious, I'm surprised you haven't had telephone calls galore."

Gustin, who resided at 437 Gartin Ave., said the objects were generally in an easterly to southeasterly direction, not clustered, but in the same general area.

"All I could see at first," he said, "were red blinking lights, but they were going on and off slower than an aircraft warning light."

Having held a private pilot's license, Gustin has had experience in flying conventional aircraft.

He estimated the objects at an altitude of 15,000-20,000 feet, and noted that aerobic movements of some of them were "too sharp to be man-made." Their movements were extremely fast. "They were turned 90 degrees."

Gustin added, "This hardly stops a thought that a human being couldn't have been inside."

He noted that he and three other police officers will equip themselves with high-powered binoculars and stand watch tonight at the ranger tower, just in case any others turn up.

Ramey Home Residents Sight 'Objects In Sky'

The second sighting of "objects in the sky" was reported Monday night — this time by Miss Gertrude Ramey, founder and superintendent of the Ramey Children's Home, and about 14 of the home's residents.

Miss Ninel Effingham, a student at Ashland Community College, said she and the other residents saw the objects from the college area — at high school and near the home — about 8:30 until nearly 9 in p.m.

Miss Ramey said the children have been talking about seeing something in the sky last night but the only thing it would pick up was white flashes of light, she said.

The ACC sophomore said she "stood there with my mouth open" as the objects would "zip up" and "zip down."

Police Officer
Sees Flying
Saucers
Police officers in Ashland
have for years been watching
strange, unidentified flying
objects. Now, one of the police officers has reported seeing them.

Ramey Home Residents
Sight 'Objects In Sky'
The second sighting of "objects in the sky" this week
Monday night — this time by
Miss Gertrude Ramey and
superintendent of the Ramey Children's Home, and
about 14 of the home's residents.

A previously skeptical Patrolman Roger Gussler, who
"never looked for flying saucers before," told his co-workers this morning that he watched the objects for nearly three
hours Sunday night.

"And I wasn't just seeing
things," the patrolman declared. "I was watching definite
views. I'm surprised you haven't
had telephone calls galore."

The "thing," he said, was
silver in color and much bigger
than a star, appeared first over
the home and later reappeared about 11 other smaller
objects.

Gussler, who resides at 4357
Gartin Ave., said the objects
were generally in an easterly
to southeasterly direction, not
clustered, but in the same general area.

Miss Minel Effingham, a student at Ashland Community
College, said she and other
youngsters — all high school
age — watched the unidentified flying objects from
about 8:30 until nearly 10 p. m.

"All I could see at first," he
said, "were red blinking lights,
slower than an aircraft warning light."

Having held a private pilot's
license, Gussler has had experience in flying conventional
aircraft.

He estimated the objects at
an altitude of 15,000-20,000 feet,
and noted that periodic movement, some of them in an upward direction of 3,000-4,000
feet, were exceedingly fast.

He noted that he and three
other police officers still equip
themselves with high-powered
binoculars and stand watch
night after night at the ranger tower, just
in case any others turn up.

Miss Ramey said the bitter
cold kept her inside most of
the time but she did make
several trips outdoors to watch
the objects. Joining her during she said, "If I had not
want to be taken for a fool."

I'm going to send them to The
Independent to see Bob McCullough. (McCullough is editor
of The Independent and on the
Home board of directors.)

Miss Effingham, who said she
had "never seen anything like
it," said the large object would
get red, dim, disappear and
then reappear. "It is smaller
objects stayed silvery in color
and in formation of about three
to four hours, and then the large one did.

The children have a large
telescope on a tripod and used
it last night but the only thing
it would pick up was white
flashes of light, she said.

"The ACC sophomore said she
"stood there with my mouth
open" as the objects would
hover, move off and return.
"There was no motor sound
and (they) traveled extremely
(Continued on Page 12, Column 5)

Ramey Home
(Continued From Page One)

Miss Effingham said the formations didn't take off but just
dimmed and disappeared.
"There may be some explanation," she said, "but I don't
stand it," she said, adding that
there was not much sleep last
night for the youngsters who
saw the phenomena.

Several miles from the Ramey Home, and about the same
time the children were watching the sky, Ashland Patrolman Roger Gussler and Clyde
Trimble were stationed at the
ranger tower with high-powered binoculars.

Gussler, who reported seeing
the objects, said he and Trimble did not see anything
except several "shooting stars
and airplanes" during their 2½
hours of watch.

The patrolman said "the view
is beautiful, you can see all
around," but none of the objects he watched for nearly
three hours Sunday night were
seen. The tower is located off
U.S. 60 between Ashland and
I-64 and he and Trimble
called it off about 10 p. m.

"They were just hovering but they went so fast I
thought my eyes were playing tricks on me," she said. After
watching for about an hour, she said "had no trouble
seeing."

Mrs. Hand said she mentioned
the incident this morning to her
son, Stephen, 11, and was told
that he had seen objects earlier
in the night but hadn't mentioned
them until his mother did.

The mother had taken her son to
the doctor last night and had left
him in the car after they return-
ed while she went into a nearby
neighbor's home. She said that
about 9:50 Stephen told his moth-
er this morning that it was while
he was waiting in the car for her
that "he had seen the objects in
the sky." She said the objects
similar to those she later saw.

Another sighting was reported
this morning by Mrs. Helen Jus-
tice of 2908 Hackworth St., whose
son, Bobby, 22, told her of seeing
an object at 10:10 last night as
he was driving on 29th St. 15th
St. was driving home from
his parents' house and noticed an
object at the top of his windshield
as he passed Moore Street. He
said the object which was about 50
feet was hovering low ahead of
him and he followed it to 29th
and Main Streets where it "just
disappeared."

Bobby was quoted her son as
saying the first thought the ob-
ject was a reflection from a car
or other light. "It made no
sound," he said.

Dear Sir:

In checking the airport records, we find that Allegheny Flight 519 arrived 8:32 p.m., November 28th and departed shortly thereafter. It was a Convair 580 with red and white strobe lights and as you know the Convair 580 makes very little noise.

Several weeks ago we had the same request from persons along the Ohio Valley, Northeast of the airport and from investigating the area we found that it was in the flight pattern of Allegheny flights.

If we can be of any other assistance please feel free to request.

Very truly yours,
A. O. Cappadony, Manager
