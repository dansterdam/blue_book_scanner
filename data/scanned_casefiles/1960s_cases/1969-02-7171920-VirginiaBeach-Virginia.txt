PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 5/7/1930 - 2200
2. LOCATION: Virginia Beach, Virginia
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
7. W-E then N-S
8. WEATHER: Clear
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: Possible AIRCRAFT
COMMENTS: The observer sighted a craft that was shaped like a broom with colored panels that changed to olive green. At 1930 local, the object was traveling from W to E and was about 3-400 ft high. At 2200 hrs, the observer sighted the object again at about 100 ft high. No one else reported seeing any such craft despite the long duration and low altitude. It also seems that the observer sighted it twice while no one else seems to have seen it. Also the conclusion of "Possible AIRCRAFT" seems to indicate that the observer did not take pictures but apparently did not try to call anyone else's attention to the object. It is felt that if the observer did see something, it could have been an aircraft.

Dear Sir:

I would like to report a sighting of a UFO on Feb. 5, 1969 - views from my home window.

First observation: Around 7:30 p.m. sudden appearance of a bright light in southwest sky, much brighter than any star or planet, and seemed almost as bright as a small aircraft landing light. Moved slowly at first, then increased speed and disappeared to the West.

Second observation: Around 8:30 p.m. same bright light reappeared in the southwest, moved very slowly, then increased speed and disappeared to the West.

Apparent physical aspect: Much larger than any star or planet, brighter than anything in the sky. Moved with purpose, not like a star or planet.

Duration of sightings: First - around 30 seconds. Second - around 60 seconds.

Conditions: Clear sky, stars and planets visible. Exact time correct, as checked with atomic clock in living room, correct within 10:00 p.m.

Additional info: No sound from object, no trail or exhaust, no other craft in area. I have reported this to the people you requested.

The shared image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

The text reads:

"for twelve flight east, with me; subject to investigate. Witnesses about his actions were a 12 year old female observing, not to have an interest in and was said present report of the sighting incident. the closest approximation was about 1 miles, as thought; have been viewed as a flying disc of metallic like characteristics, hovering at the time & later went off at a terrific rate of speed, out of sight. This description seems to be quite different from the original one given and it is doubtful either information given is accurate, as the Witness stated that she was a good distance from the object. A detailed investigation does not seem to be justified in this case. The sighting is filed but no further action taken."

The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text and black redactions.

Transcribed text from the document:

"I felt they gave me some idea that
they had taken possession of this craft
and they were keeping them on the bottom
of the ocean and several of them as
you see for swimming under water and
take pictures of it."

Dear Sir:

Tonight at about 7:02 or 7:03 I would like to know if you picked up anything strings on your radar. If you did or didn't, I would like to report a dime-shaped flight that was seen. When I first saw it I thought it was a plane on fire because at the front of it there was a bright light. Than the evening after I saw it when I noticed a jet flying much higher, the thing seemed to move toward the jet and then veer away from the jet. It was moving from west to east at about 300 m.p.h. It had a light on each end that I first mentioned and a bright light in the center.  

I would like to have an answer from you as soon as possible. There is a drawing of what I saw along with this letter. Please answer as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Wade Bell

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram of a UFO-like object. The sketch depicts an oval-shaped craft with what looks like a structure or protrusion on the top. The text below the sketch reads "(COVER?)", suggesting this could be part of a Project Blue Book report or document.

As an OCR system, I would produce the following text output from the document:
