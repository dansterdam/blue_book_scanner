11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a craft that was shaped like a broom with the handle cut off. It had red lights in front and purple colored panels that changed to olive green. At 1930 local, the object was seen for 3 minutes. Was traveling from W - E and was about 3 - 400 ft high. At 2200 hrs, the observer sighted the object going from N - S at about 100 ft high.

COMMENTS: No one else reported seeing any such craft despite the long duration and low altitude as given by the observer. It also seems strange that the observer sighted it twice while no one else seems to have seen it at all. Also the observer stated that he had time to run into the house and come back outside and take pictures but apparently did not try to call anyone else's attention to the object. Since no one else reported any similar object, it is felt that if the observer did see something, it could have been an aircraft

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR TELEPHONE POLE. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE MATCH IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

The match would have covered about one eighth of the earth.

Louisville, Kentucky 40200

Dear Sirs:

Tonight at about 7:02 or 7:03 I would like to know if you picked up anything strange on your radar. If you did or didn't, I would like to report a disc-shaped about 56 feet in diameter and about 600 feet high. When I first saw it I thought it was a plane on fire because at the front of it there was a light brighter than the evening star itself.

After I saw it I noticed a jet flying much higher, the thing seemed to move toward the jet and then move away from the jet. It was moving from west to east at about 500 mph. It had four lights on it; the light that I first mentioned and a light on each of the sides.

I would like to have an answer from you as soon as possible. There is a drawing of what I saw along with this letter. Please answer as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Wade Bell

Dear Msgs:

The picture I am enclosing have a weird color to them. It is the same color which existed from the panels in the top of the craft.

The picture marked "C" is a color change of the panels.

I would like to have my slides sent back when you are done with them. Also, I would like to know your conclusions.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

A-B = 1ST SIGHTING
C-D = 2ND SIGHTING

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
