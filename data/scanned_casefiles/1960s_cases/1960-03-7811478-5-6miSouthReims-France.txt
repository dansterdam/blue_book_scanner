"5 MILES S. REIMS, FRANCE - VISUAL SIGHTINGS AT TIME OF UFO LANDING AREA
At approx. 9:30 P.M., 7 March 1960, several French Air Force officers observed a brilliant light in the sky near the village of Cernay, about 5 miles S. of Reims, France. The light appeared to be descending slowly towards the ground, leaving a luminous trail behind it. The light was observed for about 45 seconds, then disappeared behind a hill. The observers then drove to the spot where the light had seemed to land and found an elliptical area of scorched and flattened grass, approx. 30 yards long by 15 yards wide. The grass was found to be charred, as though by an intense heat. An analysis by French Air Force Technical Services indicated that some kind of "scorching effect" had taken place at this landing site. No trace of a craft or vehicle was found, only the burned and flattened grass area. The French Air Force officers who witnessed this incident were:
Lt. Col. J. Cicala, Capt. P. J. Nouaillier. Asst. Chief of Operations, Reims Air Base.
Capt. R. Picard, Asst. Electronics Officer, Reims Air Base.
Capt. P. Barrere, Asst. Weather Officer, Reims Air Base. 
They reported the incident to the French Air Force and Air Technical Intelligence Center."

Transcribing the text from the document:

CASE 1711-78
OBJECT TO SIGHTING AT 7:15 PM, MARCH 22, 1960
DATA SECURED INDICATING THAT PILOT OF A C-47 TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT FLYING 12,000 FEET ALTITUDE APPROXIMATELY 6.5 MILES SOUTH OF REIMS, FRANCE OBSERVED A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE AIR WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS BEING APPROXIMATELY 2 HOUR OUT OF SCAN OF THE RADAR EQUIPMENT ABOARD HIS AIRCRAFT. PILOT AND CREW STILL UNABLE TO EXPLAIN SATISFACTORILY THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED. APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A-TAN-GIBLE OBJECT OF SOME SORT WHICH DID NOT MANEUVER BUT EMITTED A TANGIBLE ORANGE GLOW FROM A SINGLE POINT. REACTION OF THE PILOT AND CREW STILL FOLLOWS SIMILAR PATTERN.

STATION ESTIMATE:

At 10:15 P.M., the object was observed to be stationary. It appeared to be cigar-shaped, about as large as a C-47 aircraft, and was very slow in moving. It appeared to be illuminated on the inside, and was as bright as magnesium flare. The object was sighted for about 10 to 15 seconds.
