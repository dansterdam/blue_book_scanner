A sundog seen from a plane can suggest a spectacular and fantastic structure, like the one reported over Rheims, France, at 2:30 p.m. local time on March 31, 1960. The pilot and crew of a C-47 plane described the unknown as like a gigantic spool of thread some twelve feet tall. The neck of the spool, about six feet in diameter, seemed to be capped at top and bottom by disks eight or ten feet in diameter. The upper disk was reddish, the lower, blue-green. The plane was flying at 6000 feet and had just passed from a storm area into a region of calm with unlimited visibility. The UFO remained in view for about sixty seconds, then suddenly vanished. From an analysis of the data, the position of the unknown relative to the sun and the observers, and the weather situation, Air Force investigators positively identified the object as a mock sun [1].

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: 5-6 Mi. S of Reims, France
Date: 31 March 1960       Hour (Z): 1537Z
WX: Good, vis and between 8th & 9th
Description: Object similar to tapered spool standing on one of its flat surfaces, 14-12 ft tall 6 ft dia in middle and ends 8-10 ft diameter. Top "beige" was red, center white and bottom "white-green". Observer was at 6000'
and gazed to right of any object, that appeared to be stationary ( over )

Direction of Motion: Stationary (?)
Satellites: (AFCIN-APS, Phone 69219)   Ruled out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): Prob Sub Sun

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-LEI):   None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc):  --------

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.:   Ruled out

Other:  

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Fairly Reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: Probably Sub Solar. Reflection from ice crystals in haze could possibly cause this. Altitude was 6,000 msl observation from 5-6 mi. Just after clearing storm, etc.

Description cont:
at at least moved very slowly. It appeared to maintain the same position and altitude.
Passed out of sight. (Who, the end or what?) Object viewed for 60 seconds.
