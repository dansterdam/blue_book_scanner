10. CONCLUSION
AIRCRAFT
Witness gives a very good description of a night time aircraft sighting. All lights are described exactly the way an aircraft would appear when moving towards the observers left and turning toward the observer with landing lights on.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
When first sighted it had a red light on the left of it that was flashing on and off. The object then seemed to be turning and the red light was no longer visible but the witness then saw a flashing green light. As the object continued to turn two very bright white lights became visible. Then the object appeared stationary. When the two white lights appeared stationary, the object then disappeared and the object began to move away rapidly. The following day when the witness was driving over a steel beamed bridge his car radio went off. Witness thought that the object that he had sighted the night before had something to do with it since it had never quit working before or after that time. Radio came back on when the auto was about 30 feet past the bridge.

Dear Sirs:-

I wish to report on a UFO that was sighted by myself on April 15, 1966 about 7:30 p.m. near the Peabody Shopping Center at Proctor Offices.

I was stopped for traffic when I saw - then brilliant object directly ahead of me. At first glance it appeared as though it was a plane with all blue lights in the cabin on, but carefully looking one could that strange things were taking place.

First observation this object looked like a disc - slightly out than below - very bright darkarea: A/c

Object was oval shaped the bottom part showing very slightly as though looking in the radiation of the sun. There was a narrow frame which was not illuminated between the bottom and the top half. The surface half was also bright but about 20% less than the bottom half. On the left was a very clear red light that was flashing on and off at about once a second rate somewhat higher on the right & from this light it was estimated that the object was quite large at mile then 2000 ft. Looking on this object seemed to be turning and the red light was not large visible but a flashing green light was seen. Slight 3/4 the distance to its right, part of it visible above the object, the other part was occulted by object shown in first diagram & marked (?) Then with object still turning and moving Northwest slowly. Two red circles of bright light - stop - much brighter than either of the

parte mentioned earlier appeared on
side left side. I held shown below.
Turning counter clockwise-

The circles have a very bright feature sing
and a larger hole as bright inner ring.
Then was a small dark area between the
two rings. The rings appeared as the
object was turning counter clock wise. At
the position shown the object appeared
stationary and the rings began as
clockwise in similar kind like the rings
were no longer visible but the object
started to move away or so rapidly!
At the time was the movement
started. The following day Saturday
April 16 I was driving toward the
Sylvania Blvd in Townes and
was listening to my cars radio.
This was in the vicinity of where
I thought I had seen this object
It was in the middle of this
afternoon with an overcast sky.

Gov. Francis a small bridge (occupy)
bottom of which is steel. the side with
just the rails on each side. the
radar station was blanked out and
sweating + static noise were heard.
After the radar broke down but
about 50 ft. passed the bridge the
radar returned to normal. just to
make sure I started to back up
to the bridge + again the loud whisting
+ static noise appeared. While stopped
on the bridge turned across the
entire broadcast band and could
not hear a single station even though
there was a station WJAG just
a quarter of a mile away. About
36 seconds later everything was
coming per normal with about the
usual amount of static heard - about
the same. the radio has not acted
up. it is the paradox as after the
incident. I know the radio was
O.K. because found it being at it
one time referring them. So that's
about the end of what was, saw
+ heard by myself. I don't

know what it was what I had
seen it opt for the fact of the
flashing deck + ground lights with the normally
are a possible with the familiar aircraft
+ there were very clear + distinct. But
it was an interesting sight. I would
have given this a further thought
still for the fact that several other
persons had reported their findings
as was made made on the morning
radar news. Note: - There is a
Possible NIKE site a couple of
miles from the vicinity of the sighting
