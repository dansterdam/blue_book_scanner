Dear Sirs:

In answer to your request for written information the sighting of an unidentified flying object, I submit the following information:

On the night of August 6, 1962 at hours 2025 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, my attention was directed to a brilliant object falling or flying through the sky. It first appeared to my unobstructed view as a prodigiously large angle from the horizon due west of Santa Cruz. Its brilliance was slightly less than the intensity of the sun at midday, but the object was much smaller. As far as I could determine, there was no

illumination of my immediate surroundings resulting from the object. As I did not see the object at the beginning of its appearance (its presence being indicated to me by another person) I cannot describe its original appearance.

The object was apparently descending in a nearly vertical path toward the western horizon. Small particles of its substance were trailing at a regular intervals, each extinguishing itself as a new one separated from the original body. My best estimate of the number of glowing particles or illumination in trail of the object is seven or eight, each spaced at intervals approximately two to three times the diameter of the original object and a straight line behind the original.

The object was in my view for about three seconds and in view of my companion about two seconds before that. Its disappearance occurred in an almost instantaneous decrease in brilliance and sudden extinction of the original object. The trailing illuminations extinguished themselves in turns. The weather at time of occurrence was a clear sky with a small amount of smoke and haze. Wind was from the northeast at about five to ten knots.
