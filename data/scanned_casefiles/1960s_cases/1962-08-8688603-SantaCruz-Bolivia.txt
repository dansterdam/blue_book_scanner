In answer to your request for written information on the sighting of an unidentified flying object:
On the night of August 6, 1962 at hours 2025 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, my attention was directed to an unobstructed view of the horizon. I observed a brilliant light in the sky travelling at an extremely high rate of speed from east to west. Its course was approximately 45 degrees from the horizon. The light, round in shape, seemed to suddenly disappear behind a cloud cover. At no time was any sound associated with the object heard. The sighting lasted approximately 5-10 seconds.

Illumination of my immediate surroundings resulting from the object. As I did not have on my person any light producing device (such as a flashlight, etc.), I cannot describe its original appearance. As I first saw it, the object appeared to be a clear sky, with a small amount of smoke and haze. Wind was from the northwest. The object was in my view for about two seconds before that. Its disappearance occurred in an almost instantaneous manner in brilliance and sharpness. The object appeared to be a clear sky with a small amount of smoke and haze.
