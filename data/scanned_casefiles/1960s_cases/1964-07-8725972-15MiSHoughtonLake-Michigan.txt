Hynek spoke with him on 13 May 65 regarding his observation of 17 Jul 64.

Flying was coming back from straits, South of Hilton Lake, heading 220 deg, at altitude of 4500 ft. Out of my eye to the left, 7 o'clock, saw four lights, coming up rapidly, about 11 mi. Thought it was another airliner, change course wasn't look like this, my speed was 150, was just about ready to make a turn. As they approached, two more lights, at first very dim, came up behind and stayed at 3 o'clock position, followed for about five minutes, along near (two top lights dimmed and faded back), saw formation of bombers and it was definitely not an airplane.

Noon and stars were out. There was a haze layer. Flying at 4500 alt. There were other people on the plane, they were sleeping, you just don't tell your passengers, that you think you're going to be hit. So busy trying to figure out what is happening, I was probably flying, thought flying maneuvers were possible but not probable. Has this subject (UFOs) come up much among the pilots he associates with? Yes, but so many people are skeptics about it that no one cares to say anything about it.

Was there a change in intensity of the lights you saw? Just the two top lights, dimmed. There was no reflection, it just wasn't an airplane, at that time. As I recall, they would have closed in, and passed me. A jet cannot slow up that fast. There was something and it wasn't an airplane, sure could like to find out. Pattern: a red formation, aerial together, they could have been attached, each light was larger than a star, quite a bit brighter than a star, no difficulty in seeing the objects, have layer with, two on top of plane, two on edge of bottom of plane and two in midaisle, like steps. They were definitely being flown by someone with intelligence. The just impossible for something to come up and then definitely something there. Didn't want my advertising about seeing this object; just curious to know what he saw. Didn't try to contact anyone. Circular object; just curious.

Too many lights, dimmed, lower lights seemed to drift back, watched them as they drifted back, when I looked back they weren't there.

SUBJECT GENERAL COMMENTS: Mr [redacted] seemed to be most impressed by the rapid approach of lights and their sudden descent. He fully expected them to pass him, and he was preparing to take evasive action to prevent collision. Instead, the lights came to about 1 to 2 o'clock position fast, and the lights came for five minutes. When he first saw them his heart fell to his feet. "Never saw anything like it". Objects were only 200-300 feet away.

Lights might have been physically attached - or they could have been craft flying in close and almost formation. Brighter than stars. You have to sort of look for the stars - these were right there to see easily. Lights seemed centered on line: 3 above wing, 2 on line and 2 below wing. Objects disappeared quickly.

Above is report by Dr J Allen Hynek regarding his conversation with [redacted].
