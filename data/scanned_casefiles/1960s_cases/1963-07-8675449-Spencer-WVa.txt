On July 4, at 8:30 a.m., Mr. and Mrs. Robert Carr of Waymnouth reported seeing "a dark object" emitting an orange glow and moving in an irregular path above the Archbishop Williams High School. The observers could not see how big it was, but there was a strong orange glow at the bottom. It was fully light, about 8:30. The object was visible for several minutes before it disappeared behind some trees and houses. The most pronounced detail was the orange hue at the bottom and a dark surface or area at its top, the report states.

Slow Moving Discs
Sometime between 6:30 and 7:00 p. m. on July 7, 1963, the Le Blanc family near Bantam, Connecticut observed several disc-shaped UFOs. These were first seen by two of Mrs. Angela Le Blanc's children as the objects floated slowly over the hills southwest of Bantam. The entire family was called to watch as the discs moved slowly from the southwest to the northeast. The estimated altitude of the discs was from 2000 to 3000 feet and the objects appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter. 
The length of the observation was longer than one minute but the exact figure was undisclosed in published reports. Police were unable to provide an explanation.

While playing outdoors, a 12-year-old girl reported seeing a bright, round and larger than any other star. She said that it was above the antenna of the house west of them at about 10°-45° elevation. All of a sudden the "object" disappeared straight down disappearing below the rooftops. Calling her mother, she also watched the object which was still visible. Her mother joined her in watching as the object proceeded in a horizontal path. After one minute it could no longer be seen. The girl said, "It was standing there for at least 10 sec when all of a sudden it dropped!" No sound.
Duration - one minute plus.

NEAR LANDING IN GEORGIA: A series of exceptional sightings of which a number occurred in Georgia during the summer of 1963.

This particular report concerned a sighting that occurred about July 8th. In the evening, the family was sitting on the porch when they noticed a strange object in the sky. It did not appear to be an airplane or any other known object. 

The object was moving slowly and noiselessly. It descended gradually until it was only about 50 feet off the ground. The object remained hovering for several minutes, illuminating the area with a bright light. 

Suddenly, the light on the bottom of the craft was turned on, apparently for the purpose of illuminating the ground below. After a short time, the object turned off the light and suddenly disappeared from the scene.

The object had no exhaust and moved silently. The green spotlight seemed to be focused upon the object itself, leaving no doubt in the minds of the witnesses that they were looking at a solid craft resting on or close to the ground. The witnesses, a family, reported a tingling sensation during the sighting and are of the opinion that the object may have had a damaging effect upon them.

It realizes that the elements contained has something to do with the flight given off. But it seems odd that a 100 lb. meteorite could have made impressions this size certainly would have illuminated the whole countryside if seen at night. ...

GLOBAL SIGHTINGS
CHARLTON - England...Charles Willshire reports in our August & September 1963 Bulletin that various residents of the Charlton, Wilshire area saw a brilliant round object over the Char tern Farm. This Farm is in a crater and craters on an English Farm. The object was under the object that papers described over the fact that a convenient solution case land been found. It was presumably a god sent down according to William Stoneham's article in the Journal ET. Other explaining instances find it cut to be meteorites. None of these explaining fit the facts. From the event neither comes near an explanation.
Bomb Disposal Unit, arrived on the scene. Also preliminary report indicated that there were no burn or scorch marks, nor debris, no radioactivity. A neighbor who saw the object said that on July 10, it was reported that Capt. Rogers had sought permission to land a craft and said his readings on his meter indicated a material on the ground. He added: "We have never caught anything like this before". One man later told reporters that his detector indicated activity-
Meanwell's counterpart in England, the historian military officer, was where the bomb disposal unit removed a piece of concrete and said it had been found buried-underground-Moore incorporated found it that very day that was a meteorite. He declared it was a meteorite-even to the recent cost of repeating this scientific demand .
Describing the phenomenon, he says: "A bright streak in the sky, which indicated that the flash also showed the shape of an egg slicer on a round glass container, about 12 feet across, was observed for ten seconds." This was witnessed by many, he says, "Southern Command commented "The cause of the phenomena is still unexplained, but it is no basis for the event was asked about it in Hurst. They said: "Dr" Randall is a very strong enemy of the belief in the disappearance and remained to be discredited, doctor. and TV stations quoted here ".
It appears that the Bomb Disposal Unit recognized him in Woorden and took a statement as fact.
A curious observation was Blanchard who owns the Farm, states of the position of the object, that on the following morning, july 11. there were no traces, no roots, no stones, no burned spots. The thing was simply vanished without a trace and there were no odors or sound. So it use produces no power or so that it ever powers that it uses produce no orders of any kind.
As shown, the Farm owner had been called in to disclose details, but except Village Constable, Anthony J. Rogers, who had to be interviewed on July 10. It vanished near the first crater was found. Warden of the incident in his daily report stated " A meteor passing in the sky-low". Mr. Reg Andrews, a dairyman (Pastor Pane) who was present in the field that morning at approx 6:00 AM.

Saucer: Flying Saucer Review - May-Dec.

Interesting feature - were four slight indentations and were 20 ft. long and started 6 ft. from the centre. The two single imprints the length of the circle were oblong, and the soil inside the field were disturbed, the centre of the potato field was in an undisturbed state. Depressions in the earth 4 ft. wide and 3 in. deep and where they had been the vegetation had disappeared, including weeds and corn.

Dowsing reactions: A circular dowsing zone of radius 35 ft. extended from the centre of the circle. The readings were intense, reactions along the four radii coincident with the slots and also along the eight spokes at 30 degree intervals. Was visited Charlton again on July 21 and found the same moving reactions.

On July 25 Dr. Read, of the BACC, planned to survey the site, but poor weather prevented him from doing so. No instruments had been written to about the hole, so it remains a mystery at the time. There is mention of stone (apparently responsible for the readings on the instruments) had been found, and Patrick Moore said it could be a meteorite.

The Charlton crate - Sir, I expect you would many reports of the alleged "flying saucer" marks at Charlton yesterday when the "saucer" was apparently reported to have landed. But perhaps this will interest you from the viewpoint of the marks made on the ground.

On July 19 - here is my description of the time with comments with Mr. Bleached and later with Patrick Moore and Mr. Binchad (a local landowner):

(1) The marks were found near the path leading to a gate, about 80 yards from the road. Newspaper reports (these were later confirmed by Mr. Binchad) gave the diameter as 60 ft. and 1 ft. deep. At the centre was a circular cone, 16 in. diameter and 6 in. deep, and four slots radiating from the central cone, each slot 6 ft. long and 1 ft. wide. 

(2) When we arrived, a square of soil, measuring 6 ft. by 6 ft. and 6 in. deep, had been removed, and in this hole there was some black, carbonised, charcoaly material. It looked as if the original earth had been there and then removed, and the hole usually would have been filled in but was not. 

(3) The vegetation all round the edges of the circle was undisturbed, and the soil within the circle was just as compacted as that outside. The only noticeable features were the slots, the cone at the centre and the hole.

Later on we discussed the hole with Patrick Moore, who said:
(1) The marks were found in the first week of July at a local people's request.
(2) The cow was found dead, with strange marks on its body, some distance from the "saucer" site and I don't know if this has anything to do with the "saucer" landing.
(3) The "saucer" left no imprint - Patrick Moore said it could have landed on landing pads and he was baffled by the phenomenon. He said it did not appear to be a hoax, as it was too extensive and the marks coherent.

'OLD BOMB MAY
BE ANSWER

Center mystery

A BOMB dropped 50 years ago could provide a clue to a mysterious wartime incident in which two Yorkshire miners were killed by an explosion. The explosion which took place on August 21, 1913, killed two miners at Bentley Colliery, near Doncaster, and there have been many attempts over the years to discover the cause. Now it is suggested that the explosion may have been caused by an unexploded wartime bomb. During the First World War, experimental bombs were sometimes dropped by aircraft for target practice, and some of them failed to explode. It is surmised that one of these may have been dropped in the area and lain undiscovered until detonated by the miners years later. There was some misunderstanding at the time about the cause of the explosion, and it was assumed to have been caused by a build-up of gas in the mine. This theory has now been discounted. There were a few other minor indications of some kind of wartime weapon being involved, but the full circumstances were never established. But we are now forced to conclude that this is the most likely explanation' says a spokesman."

The provided image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text on the page discusses a "hoaxer confess" and how the press behaves in relation to UFO reports and theories. The text covers various topics such as the Wilshire crater mystery, responses from the public, and the arrival of "exhibitionists" who suddenly appear on the UFO scene.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

THE Wilshire crater mystery not only served to bring the dying guest to the light, but also illumined the attitude of several newspapers. Not all arc now hostile to the concept and those which have found it necessary to adopt a guarded and defensive position have been erratic in their various "explanations" of the crater's origin. Telegrains were pouring in demanding to know why it was there and what was being done about it. Some of the "explanations" came from correspondents who had the reputation of being badly burnt. After having printed "Dr. Randall's theory," it then accepted the unguarded statement that it was the result of a crashed weather balloon. Of course, responsible readers of the September-October issue of the Flying Saucer Review will recall that an article was published in July 22, "The Origin of the Wilshire Crater. South invoked the principle of Occams' razor to show that it could not result from a crashed flying saucer, but from other means."

This article was written not only in ignorance of the latest developments in the crater controversy but also in ignorance of the fact that several students have in the past ignored Occam's sound advice and have considered all possible mundane explanations which the crater suggested. The hallucination and the misinterpretation of natural phenomena have been exhaustively examined and re-examined by competent, inter-planetary theory accepted as a working hypothesis and it was found that ft fitted all the observable data. Orthoreny then clinched the matter with a proof that any open-minded scientist should have accepted.

A new and recent feature is the arrival of the exhibitionists who suddenly appear on the scene. Sometimes they arrive as flying saucer experts, but more often as self-confessed hoaxers. In the Southern England incident, for example, the mention of "Dr. Randall", who would otherwise have remained in obscurity, for the entrance of the self-confessed hoaxer, has now brought him into the limelight. An example of the self-confessed hoaxer was to be found in the British incident where an airman confessed that he had made the hoax photographs, but it was packed it up. The questions that should now be put to Mr. Searl are: For what reasons did he make this confession? Is it that now he hopes to cash in on the publicity and if so, how long will it be before he recants and claims that after all he was only joking and that the story of the confessed hoax was a hoax itself? There are a number of reasons, and the press and public should be on their guard. The questions that should now be put to Mr. Searl are: For what reasons did he make this confession?

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page discusses various UFO-related events and incidents that were reported in different publications, including The Daily Mail and the Flying Saucer Review. It mentions the alleged sighting of a "strong magnetic effect at the center" of a UFO and discusses the explanations and reactions to these reported events.

Here is the text from the document:

prosecuted whenever they are caught. Finally, a growing number of people of ail kinds become interested in try to discover the truth and to produce the strong magnetic effect at the center. But for this, the Daily Mail has reported that some flying saucers have been spotted over France, the existence of which has never been explaine<3. It seems that they produce this effects. It was called Trench phenomenon" and puzzled the witnesses as it has never been explained.

Some flying saucers coming over France left rings three metres in diameter, and the wind did the rest. Some of them drawing straight lines patterns all over France, including the BA747 line and others. The Daily Mail (London, October 6, 1954) had a story they claimed it was authentic.

Mr. Southern adds that he is not going to publish his reaction, and when the editors were quite certain to know their readers do not like such rumors, the Mail said that to public (Continued on page 33).

would be open this matter for endless dis-
cussion. It was pointed out in a reply that the
public looks to papers like The Daily Mail as an authori-
tative source and that the case is left to the judgment of
that paper. However, in another letter to one
of the readers of the magazine, this Daily Mail
editorial was described, and it was claimed that
the Charlton crater had been caused by a
flying saucer. This is particularly revealed perhaps by the fact that if did. What is betrayed is a fear that the cause of flying saucers
might be advanced (as indeed it has been) to a point that the mystery cannot
be solved by any rationalisation. When the
scientists have had been exposed, the credibility will
begin to crack and the faith will wobble. This is
belief in saucers in a leading article) was left
without its truth argument that most significant
evidence had been either suppressed or dismissed.
fore rushed to print Mr. Southern's original
statement despite the fact that it was obviously
false.
If the Daily Mail is anti-saucer because it fears
ridicule, perhaps it will now realise that the tide
has turned. The public is beginning to laugh at
those who distort the truth, not at those who are
trying to establish it. This document.

CRATER RIDDLE
ON THE FELLS
Farmers' discovery

Yorkshire farmers discovered what they described as a crater, some 40 feet across and 5 feet deep, on the Fells at Warminster on Saturday. Describing their find, the farmers said they saw a circular depression with the edges of the turf being disturbed as if something heavy had dropped there, crushing the grass and vegetation. Around the rim of the crater, the grass was burnt and smoking. They could see no sign of an impact crater caused by a meteorite or aircraft, and said that tracks of up to 40 sheep were leading to the center of the depression but nowhere away from it. Though unable to account for the crater's appearance, the farmers thought it had some connection with unidentified flying objects reportedly seen in that area in recent months.

Enclosed is a photostat of a clipping I received from an English newspaper. It seems that "good looking UFO" is seen in the sky by some people. I think it is worth looking into as the thing seems to be linked with a UFO. If so, here is more tangible evidence which your group denies to exist.

Sincerely,
Wenham, Mass.

THE WILTSHIRE CRATER MYSTERY
The meteorite that never was
JULY 16, 1963, will long be remembered in British UFOlogy. It brought the sudden discovery of a large crater into a field at Wylye, Wiltshire. Immediately, the crater became the subject of widespread comment and speculation as to the cause of its sudden appearance.
Something appeared to have crashed, or landed, and left a deep conical depression in the ground approximately 40 feet across and several feet deep. Many examined the crater, and all were impressed with its size and the fact that it seemed to have been formed abruptly. Mrs. Waverley Girvan, who owns the farm on which the crater is situate, stated that she first noticed it on July 11, and a local schoolboy, Robin Westmead, claimed that he had seen strange lights in the area on the previous night.
From this point on the mystery deepened. Theories abounded as to the cause, some quite wildly speculative. Some thought it had been caused by a meteorite, others by a crashed unidentified flying object, known in the parlance of UFOlogy as a U.F.O. The press were attracted by the story, and for some days the Wiltshire crater was the subject of much attention and speculation, both in public and behind the scenes in official circles.
But something appeared to have happened which was to prove very puzzling. The crater was examined by representatives of the Ministry of Aviation, the Meteorological Office and others. They concluded that the crater could not have been caused by the impact of a meteorite. This view was reinforced by the absence of any fragments of a meteorite that could have been expected had a body of that nature hit the ground at such force.
The Ministry of Aviation representatives suggested that the cause of the crater might have been the collapse of a void in the underlying chalk. This was supported by the fact that the crater had been formed in an area of chalk subsoil. But even this theory did not quite tally with the suddenness and apparent violence with which the crater had appeared.
And now the mystery deepens still further. A few days later, the Wiltshire crater seemed to have disappeared! It was no longer there. Mrs. Girvan re-examined the site and could find no trace of it. This was confirmed by others who had seen the original crater. The deep conical depression had simply vanished, as if it had never existed.
So what was the Wiltshire Crater Mystery all about? Was it a real, physical phenomenon, or a hoax? If a real event, what caused the crater to appear so suddenly and then vanish so mysteriously? The speculation continues, and the mystery remains unsolved.

this before 'One of his men' later told suggested that his delicate behavior was wildly This is a crucial that he was 'completely out of contact with reality'

It soon becomes clear that the events now to be described by means at this call for the critical scientific attention of the Ministry of Defence and attention of the scientific community. It would appear that if Doctor R. Hunter had not subjected himself to an investigation, and had the matter remained undisclosed, the truth concerning this mysterious occurring would never have come to light.

On July 16, it was reported that Captain Roger had sighted an object and that his men had encounted something 'entirely out of the ordinary' on Salisbury Plain. Dr. Hunter, told me that a small ball of light about 18 inches in diameter had been observed for several hours on the evening of July 16. This light, he said, had behaved in a most extraordinary manner, moving rapidly up and down, darting about, and finally disappearing into the distance. The doctor, who had been nearby, had watched this light for some considerable time. He told me that it had 'danced around' in a most unusual way, and that it appeared to be intelligently controlled.

On July 19, the same Dr. Hunter told me that a further investigation, carried out on his behalf by a number of his personal friends, had revealed that a deep trench, some 40 feet long and 3 feet wide and deep, had been discovered on Salisbury Plain. This trench, which had been carefully examined, showed signs of having been recently dug. The earth around the trench was found to be heavily compressed, as though some great weight had rested there. In addition, there were clear impressions in the earth, as though made by the landing gear of some heavy object.

Dr. Hunter told me that the trench was located in a marshy area of the plain, and that the compressed earth and landing impressions strongly suggested that some kind of craft had landed there. However, he said, the trench was not deep enough to have been dug by hand, and there were no tools or other debris in the immediate vicinity. The doctor expressed the opinion that the trench had been caused by the landing of some unknown object, which had then taken off again, leaving these curious marks behind.

On July 20, the same Dr. Hunter told me that a further and more detailed investigation had been carried out, and that the trench had been subjected to careful scientific examination. The results of this examination, he said, clearly indicated that the trench had been caused by the landing of some heavy object, which had then taken off again. Dr. Hunter told me that the trench was approximately 40 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 3 feet deep, and that the compressed earth around it, together with the landing impressions, strongly suggested that it had been caused by the landing of some kind of craft.

Output of the text from the document:

On July 25, the Daily Express reported the ball landing in a barley field near Meredith, New Hampshire. Police and a local pilot inspected the field but found no evidence of a landing. Meanwhile investigations continued and the reports were being evaluated. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, scientific consultant to the Air Force on Project Blue Book, was called in to investigate.

It was not very difficult to respond satisfactorily to the questions proposed by Dr. Hynek. The day after the alleged landing, Mr. Howard Meredith, the owner of the field, showed him the site. There were no marks on the ground and no evidence that anything had landed there. The possibility that a weather balloon had come down in the field was considered unlikely by Dr. Hynek, since there was no record of any balloons being launched in that area at that time.

The Command had therefore to reject the report as being without foundation. The British Museum representatives who had investigated the matter independently came to the same conclusion.

It was investigated as suspicious in itself but was found to be probably
the fragments of a Japanese balloon, which was known to be in the area
at the time. Because of the presence of communications, Southern Command
became interested, but the people indicated that this was not a national
security matter and the public indicated the same. To prevent
unwarranted rumors and alleged testimony on the part of those who
saw the object, it was decided not to release details
of the incident to the public. No further
action was taken.

If it is significant that Dr. Clarkwell, Mineralogy Department, University Museum, conducted the investigation and pronounced the object as
being totally explicated, the public would have been extremely confused
and frustrated.

There was a number of less than satisfactory features to the sighting from
a scientific point of view. Editors of technical journals and others who had
seen the films were critical of the lack of data and the poor quality of the
films. They were also doubtful as to the value of further investigation.

Concerning explanations, project it could not havo been an aircraft because the object did not change in size as it came closer. It appeared to be over a mile in altitude as it passed over at an estimated ground speed of 300 to 600 miles per hour. It was not a weather balloon because it was not affected by the wind which was about 15 mph out of the southwest at the time. It did not have the characteristics of a satellite or meteor. I was in the military at the time and have had experience in identifying all types of aircraft, missiles, and satellites, and I am convinced that what I saw was not of this world. The behavior and characteristics of the object were such that it could only be classified as an unidentified flying object.

"Did Bomb or Saucer Put Hole in a British Potato Patch?

The small hamlet of Charlton, England (population 423) was suddenly placed in the limelight during July, 1963, when a strange 6-foot wide crater appeared in a potato field. 

Two members of parliament demanded an investigation. An Army bomb disposal squad appeared on the scene on July 24th, stating that they were tackling the "normal bomb disposal job." 

Speculation rippled around the country. Some thought it was a meteor, while others feared it was the crater of a landed "flying saucer." Hundreds of curious sightseers began to appear in the area and Australian scientists stated that they had no knowledge of the man.

On July 26th it was announced that the Army unit, which had been digging for several miles, failed to find any sign of a buried charge. The interest in the incident is yet to be satisfactorily explained. Why do several points not fit the meteor explanation. There was the fact that in a neighboring barley field, a fifty-foot wide circle of the grain had been pressed flat to the ground. Also coinciding with the advent of the crater was the fact that one of Mr. W's young pigs, sleeping under a tree nearby, had died mysteriously during the night. Was it a meteor? Probably not without killing the pig. Whatever caused the hole in the potato field, apparently unconnected to any other known phenomenon, remains a mystery.

Last issue of Saucer Album, we discussed the censorship of information regarding the crashed saucers, crashes where sometimes we feel that the information is not at all akin to truth. But here, how do we explain the vanished vegedatas, burned livestock, etc. contacted with this?"

"MYSTERIOUS HOLES

Strange happenings in July, and none were sightings of flying objects. They were, however, rather weird, to have been reported in the same general area during the same week. In the villages of Dersett and East Lulworth, in Dorset and East Somerset, respectively, peculiar holes were found in the ground, as if some object from the sky had made them and then simply disappeared, roots and all. A few in Dersett were large enough for a man to walk into. One of the farmers came across one of the holes almost 3 feet wide, near to a river. He was unable to discover what could have made such a hole.

Only one of the holes has been thoroughly examined under the fishboroughs' head order. For some unknown reason, they decided to hide their findings.

NOTES ON THE DUFTON FELL GRATE
JOHN BAINBRIDGE

The Chilton crater was reported fully in the September-October issue of FLYING SAUCER REVIEW, Vol. 8, No. 2 (which is devoted to crater reports, but the present instance is briefly reported in the World Round Up section. Here is a fuller report by a local investigator.

Location and approach.-Dufton Fell in North Westmoreland. Nearest approach by car from the south around Stanley Dymond. More than 10 miles from Appleby. From the car take the winding road past Stanley Dymond side into the fell. The actual main area is then about a mile from this point.

Description of valley and crater.- A shallow natural valley, sides averaging about 15-2o deg. The central area, about 100 yards across, is more or less level with scattered rocks and boulders. Here the gathering ground for the UFOs appears to have been. Beyond this area, on the north side, the valley suddenly deepens and becomes more steep-sided, especially in the north-east section. The two craters are clearly visible across the hillside, some 300 yards apart, rather larger than their dimensions indicate. Their separation from the buildings, presently and a half mile distant, appears very definite. The floors of the craters are approximately 10 feet deep and roughly circular, the material thrown out lies in scalloped ridges some 20 yards from the crater edges.

The craters.-There are two of them, each about 100 yards in diameter, with the nearest some 300 yards apart. All this area is gently sloping, nearly level, and the craters are more or less identical, save that one is rather deeper than the other. Their rims almost meet at the highest points but shallow troughs or gullies run down to the valley floor at the bottom of the slope. These run down to the valley floor and from which had a appearance of water drainage, very much greater in area of damage. From the actual impact to the edge of the debris could be 10-15 yards across. The gullies are at most half a mile wide.

Characteristics.--The crater floors are flat, or slightly saucer-shaped, the rims are not high, merely a low circular wall, 3-4 feet in height. The inner sides slope gently down to the crater floor, not a sheer drop. The material thrown out consists of crumbled rock, breaking down into smaller fragments and soil washed down into the gullies below. There were no signs of burning, no smell, nor any signs of radioactivity. The crater floors were damp but not wet.

Damage.--The whole area of the craters is devoid of vegetation, shrubs and grasses. This applies also to the gullies and valleys which run off from the craters themselves. Some few yards beyond the crater edges the vegetation and grass is normal and undamaged. There were no signs of any marks on the surrounding hill slopes, and no disturbance to sheep or other livestock or damage to land or buildings. The general impression given was of two shallow saucer-shaped cavities formed by some explosive force or displacement of material rather than by burning or melting.

Charlie 13 July

While on the subject of hoaxes, we must admit that the most mysterious "crater" discovered in a field at Charleston, West Virginia, England, was a hoax - except for wild "lunatic fringe" statements made by one Doctor Randall (who is an ex-RAF man and a science lecturer, on the scene). Dr. Randall is still making fantastic claims of having discovered a "600-ton spaceship" which he is in detail from his imagination. Now we learn from a credible source that the crater was made by a 600-ton spaceship, which he had in detail from his imagination. Now we learn from a credible source that the crater was made by a 1000-pound weight - the trouble is that some researchers who have never received nothing - giving confirmation to our original impression that the good doctor is a quack...

There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a typed report detailing a sighting of a strange object in the sky observed by a man named Mr. Selwood on July 14, 1963 in Parkstone, West Virginia. The report describes the object's appearance, behavior, and the witness's reactions.

Information Only - Flying Saucers, Aug 64 

On the morning of Sunday, 14th July, 1963 Mr. Frank Selwood of Albert Road, Parkstone woke at 3 a.m., and on looking out of his bedroom window saw what he believed to be a steady object in the sky. For hovering over a gasolder at the back of his house was a huge cigar-shaped object "about as big as four terraced houses."

Mr. Selwood unsuccessfully tried to wake his wife, Mrs. Selwood returned to the window to find the object still hovering about 300 feet from the ground. In the middle distance, the flickering became blue-green lights. From the object came a "humming sound, like a quiet sort of whistling."

It continued to hover for almost three minutes and then suddenly appeared to rise into the air. The motor and the flashing light began continuous along the object's entire length. It then moved off at a fantastic speed.

Friends and relatives to whom Mr. Selwood spoke about his experience did not believe him, and suggested that he had a bad dream. But he has talked about the incident so much since that they realize that he did see something, and that it was no dream or hallucination.

This sighting was made three days before the news of the Charleston crater was reported in the newspapers.

ASTRONOMY

Scorpion Shines in South

A total eclipse of the sun, visible along a path about 60 miles wide crossing Alaska, Canada and Maine, July 20, is the astronomical event of the month.

By JAMES STOKEY

WITH THE COMING of July, the evening star Scorpius, the Scorpion, shines in the south. Below the star Antares, known as the "heart of the scorpion," shines in the south, with the star Arcturus, already high in the north.

This is one of the most unusual astronomical events of the month, a total eclipse of the sun, visible in a path about 60 miles wide, which crosses Alaska, Canada and Maine. This eclipse, with the dark disk of the moon covering the face of the sun, will be visible only Part of the day in various localities.

The eclipse will begin in the northwestern Pacific, and be visible to observers in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska and northern Canada. The point of greatest eclipse, where the moon will completely cover the sun, will occur about 11:30 a.m. EDT in northern Canada, about 60 miles from the Arcris shores. The eclipse will also be visible in Maine, where the sun will be seen with a dark bite taken out of it, from about 12:34 to 2:39 p.m. EDT. This will be the last total eclipse of the sun visible from any part of the United States until 1979.

Appearances of the evening stars: About 10 p.m. Venus, our bright evening "star," is about 35 degrees above the western horizon, and about an hour earlier in the middle of the evening. Saturn is high in the southwest, as the star Antares, the "heart of the Scorpion," is low in the south. In Lyra, the lyre, which is high in the east, Vega, the brightest star in the summer sky, is the most prominent. Both these stars are shown on the map of the northern sky.

Mars and Jupiter Visible

Two planets are visible in the evening this month, though neither is very prominent. Mars is in Virgo, low in the west, and Jupiter, in the constellation of Pisces, is low in the east. This, combined with its low attitude, makes it difficult to see, especially with the haze that often at this season. There in the east is the constellation of Pegasus, and nearby the constellation of Pisces.

There in the east is the constellation of Pegasus, and nearby the constellation of Pisces.

Text extracted from the document:

"Path of Totality
To make the many scientific observations made possible by a total solar eclipse, observers are taken to various points along the path of totality. They have selected locations that offer the most favorable circumstances for their observations. This path, which will be about 140 miles wide, extends from the west coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands across Canada to Maine, and then into the Atlantic Ocean.

Along this path, the sun is completely covered by the moon for a short period of time, ranging from about 35 seconds in Northern Canada to as much as 2 minutes and 20 seconds in the ocean off the coast of West Africa. The area outside the path of totality will only experience a partial eclipse, with the moon covering only a part of the sun.

To view the total eclipse, observers must be within the path of totality. If you are in the path in Maine, and it is cloudy, you may miss the eclipse. If you are outside the path, you will not see the total eclipse, only the partial eclipse.

The sun's corona, or outer atmosphere, is visible only during a total eclipse. It is a beautiful sight, extending millions of miles into space. The corona has a ghostly, feathery appearance, with streamers of light emanating from the sun in various directions. The inner part of the corona appears bright and vapoury, gradually becoming more filamentary and diffuse with increasing distance from the sun.

Photograph of Eclipse
For a successful eclipse photograph, the camera must be precisely aimed and focused on the sun during the brief period of totality. Special filters are required to photograph the corona and prominences. The total eclipse is also an opportunity to photograph the stars and planets near the sun, which are normally obscured by the sun's light.

Numerous astronomical and scientific observations are made during a total eclipse, ranging from precise measurements of the shape and size of the moon's shadow to studies of the sun's outer atmosphere. The data collected contributes to our understanding of the sun and solar system.

The next total solar eclipse visible from the United States will occur on July 2, 1973. The path of totality will cross the northwestern states and continue across Canada. After that, the next total solar eclipse visible from the United States will be on February 26, 1979, with the path of totality crossing the northwestern states and continuing into Canada."
