Woman, 3 Girls See
Object Land, Take Off

Just what it was Mrs. Helen Tucker of 516 Young St. doesn't know, but she and three teen-agers saw something at 8:45 last night and it was like nothing they had ever seen before.

They were in West Middletown and had turned on Brown's Run Road when one of the youths said, "What in the world is that - a big bright light up there in the sky?"

"It was very bright and flashing," said Mrs. Tucker, "larger than a star, too high up to be fastened to anything."

"We drove into Poastetown as we got to the railroad tracks we saw sparks shooting from the object. We stopped and at first thought some high overhead wires were shorting out, then decided it had better be reported.

"But as we turned into a lane, one of the girls said it was moving. When I looked, I saw it moving straight ahead and very fast, and it looked like a plane. The lights weren't flashing. Then and - red and white colors were very clear. One said they saw a blush color, but I didn't."

"Occasionally we lost sight of it because it would go behind a tree."

"It was moving in the direction of Middletown and since the air field was close I thought it would circle and land."

"We followed it and I came down more rapidly than any plane I've ever seen, and when it landed, not on the airfield, but across Carmody Boulevard in the depression along the river, it looked like a Christmas tree."

"The wing, expanse was huge and appeared to be completely lit up. There were long, shooting lights like flames going up and off."

"Someone said the fuselage appeared to have a bubble on top, although I couldn't see any, but it appeared to be pointed on top the way the lights were."

"There was no activity at the airfield so we went up."

and turned around at the Firemen's Club, and as we did so someone called out that it was taking off. It looked like hot metal as it did."

"It operated like a helicopter," said Mrs. Tucker, "yet it had speed."

"We notified the police department, and they had heard of other reports of people seeing the same thing, but no one had seen it land."

"The others had seen it high in the sky."

"Now I may need my glasses changed," Mrs. Tucker commented, "but I don't need them changed that badly. We saw it!"

AF To Hear
Saucer Story
By JOY JONES

The Air Force will be in Middletown tomorrow to see Mrs. Helen Tucker, 516 Young St., and investigate the object she reported seeing last Thursday night. "I just hope they come up with some logical explanation," she said.

MRS. TUCKER, Office manager at the First Methodist Church, and three teen-age companions, first noticed the object as a bright, flashing light about 6:45 p.m. last Thursday on Brown's Run Road in West Middletown. The object was followed until it landed across Carmody Boulevard opposite the airport and then took off, they said.

Until the called Wright-Patterson Air Force Base yesterday afternoon, she thought her combination helicopter and plane which shoots out hot gases, but she was told no one ever saw one.

About 7 p.m. a woman living on Gratis on R.R. 122 heard what she thought was a plane flying over her house. The woman declined to be identified, said she was alone at the time watching television.

The TV picture was knocked off, and the lights flickered.

"I listened for awhile and it sounded more like a jet coming down," she said. "I ran to the window and saw a bright light toward the woods about a mile and a half to two miles away. It was white as could be. No one could see red spots in with the white. I got the binoculars, and then I could see red spots in the huge, great big light.

SHE EXPLAINED that she thought no more about it until she read Mrs. Tucker's report in the Journal earlier this week. Other residents in the Gratis area reportedly heard what they thought was a jet in trouble.

The object apparently had made a large circle. Mrs. Tucker reported that it landed from the northeast and headed northwest when it took off. Gratis residents reported they heard the sound approaching from the south, but the observer there said it flew over her house from the north and either landed or hovered, south east of her home.

Patrolman Jack Barnes, who was on duty the night Mrs. Tucker called, reported that police often receive UFO reports. "But none ever fit the description she gave me."

She was the only one who called that night, and it had been about two weeks since we'd gotten any other reports. No one ever said they'd seen one blinking on and off high up. No one with wings and showing fire.

It is known that an Armed Forces jet was a reported parachute drop in the area, but this could not be verified.

TDEV/UTO
UFO Sighting, Middletown, Ohio                                 DEC 10 1965

Hq USAF SAFOI0C (Mrs Hunt)

[Redacted name] has requested an evaluation of her observation which occurred on 4 November 1965. It is suggested that SAFOI relay this information to her. The following is a suggested reply:

Dear [Redacted],

The results of our investigation into your sighting on the night of 4 November leads to the conclusion that the initial phases and possibly some of the subsequent portions of the sighting were attributed to the Amoco Gulfstream 437-A which landed at approximately 1840 EST. The northeast approach path of this aircraft to Middletown was from the Northeast and the landing runway was on a azimuth of 052 degrees. Wing tip and tail flashing strobe lights are installed on the aircraft which were operating at the time, as well as top and bottom fuselage rotating beacons.

Although there is a discrepancy of about five minutes in the reported time of the sighting and landing of the aircraft, it is reasonable to assume that this small difference in time would not eliminate this as a cause of the report. Since you were parked on the highway waiting for your daughter at 5:30, and did not observe this aircraft, this gives all the more reason for us to believe that the Amoco Jet with its landing light on was the initial object sighted to the Northeast. At this time your car was moved to the railroad track, and at the same time the Amco Jet had now moved to a point near enough that the strobes and rotating beacons would give an illusion of sparks and flashing which you compared to a defective electrical transformer.

There is one point of discrepancy here in the direction reported by you as North. The aircraft was approaching from the Northeast from a heading approximately parallel with that of the railroad track. Assuming this slight error in direction, the Amco Jet could be the cause of the second phase of your sighting. During this entire phase.


- page 5 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

of your observation, the jet is making a direct approach toward the
air field. At this point you decided to move your car, and the air-
craft continued its approach following the road descending for a
landing. At this time, the wings and tail lights were clearly defined
and the speed of the aircraft would have been slowed to a point
where it would be possible for you to chase it down the road. This
third phase of your sighting consisting of the chase of the object
came to an end at 2111 consistent with an observation of the Armco
Jet.

The fourth phase consists of the lights appearing on or just
above the ground in the direction of the airport when you pulled
the car to the side of the road. This can be attributed to these
aircraft lights on the runway (invisible from that location) or
some ground lights on the opposite side of the river. The final
phase of your sighting consisting of lights rising and moving off
to the Northeast cannot be explained in terms of this aircraft.
At present we have been unable to locate any known object to account
for this portion of your sighting. A check was made with the local
radar network, and no unidentified tracks were observed on the night
of 4 November. Contact was made with all known military agencies
operating helicopter-type aircraft in Southwest Ohio, and we were
unsuccessful in placing any of these vehicles in the Middletown area
at the time of your observation. The pilot, [redacted], and the
co-pilot [redacted] of the Armco Gulfstream did not
observe any unusual lights or other aircraft during their approach
to the airport. This is particularly significant since Hook Field
has no operating control tower. The pilot in his approach to the
airport must be sure that no other aircraft are in the area in the
process of landing or taking off from the airport. Both pilots
are familiar with the local landmarks and ground lights adjacent
to the air field. No unusual lights were observed. No additional
witnesses have reported anything unusual which we can correlate with
your sightings.

Our evaluation of your observation is consistent with the above
interpretation of the sequence of events associated with your report
and the landing of the Gulfstream 3H-A-. This case will be carried
as two separate objects. The first evaluated as an aircraft, and
the second disappearing to the Northwest remains unresolved. The

Major Hector Quintanilla, USAF
Chief Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson AFB
Ohio 45433

Dear Sir:

In reply to your letter of 15 November, 1965, with reference to your investigation of an unidentified flying object, I am submitting the following information:

The pilots aboard the Armco Steel Corporation Gulfstream 4-37-A were _______ and the undersigned, who are employees of the company.

a. There were no unusual lights or other aircraft observed during the approach to the airport.

b. The time of landing was 1840 EST(23+0Z).

c. The approach path of the aircraft was from the northeast over the field after which a right turn was executed and the aircraft then proceeded westbound until entering a downwind leg on the southwesterly heading in preparation for landing to the northeast on the runway heading 052 degrees.

d. There is no afterburner used on the engines.

Insofar as there are wing tip and tail flashing strobe lights installed on the aircraft which we operated at the time, as well as top and bottom fuselage rotating beacons, we feel this might help in your investigation.

We hope that the above will be of some assistance to you.

Very truly yours,
EEM;mew                                                                 Pilot

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

10 November 1965

Mr. of West Middletown called to report a UFO.

This thing appeared to be a large round ball. It was about the size of a grapefruit in comparison to a star. It was in the Northeast, and the lights were going on and off. There long colored sparks shooting from the object. As it got closer, it appeared to be a night light with red and white and bluish lights. It started to land. It had very bright lights that went on and off very fast. The object seemed to go into a point. It had long thin wings. It appeared as though it might have had a bubble on the front. It landed to the left of the trees and had a dull deep large round red glow. Took off to the Northwest. It was less than five minutes on the ground. It took it less than 2 minutes to disappear. Next day she heard a report from a lady in West Alexandria which is near Gratis. At

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

A lady called from the Middletown Journal on 9 Oct 65 to report (the report) a UFO. The sighting was made on Thursday evening and was in the paper on Friday, Oct 5. Mrs. of , was the first witness. She is the manager of the First Methodist Church. She saw a very bright light at 6:45. Sgt Moody said that this was Venus. had been on Franklin Trent Rd. and turned on to Brownrun Rd. She was driving a car with three children in it. One of the children spotted the bright light. They next saw a very bright thing with some sparks shooting out from it. The object went behind some trees and landed. The object had wings. One of the children said that it looked pointed on top. It looked like hot metal. Had a very high speed. Lady reported it to Patrolman Barnes in West Alexandria. There was an Amco plane around 6:45, but it landed at the airport. Patrolman talked to the pilot of the plane and the pilot did not take off again after he once landed. The object did take off again.

(Another report from West Alexandria) (South of Gratia)

Another lady heard what sounded like a jet around 7 o'clock. This thing went over her house. At this time, the lights flickered in the house and the TV went off. This was a very white light.

The lady saw red in the light. She said it landed Southeast.

MIDDLETOWN, OHIO
4 NOVEMBER 1965

At 1845, 4 November 1965, observer and her three children were driving along the road when one of the children spotted a bright light, about the size of a grapefruit in comparison to a star. It was in the northeast, and the lights were going on and off. As the object got close, it appeared to be a night light with red, white and bluish lights, with sparks shooting out from it. The object had long thin wings and appeared as though it might have a bubble on the front. It landed to the left of the levee and had a dull, deep, large, round, red glow. After approximately five minutes the object took off to the northwest and disappeared in less than two minutes.

COMMENTS

The initial phases and possibly some of the subsequent portions of the sighting are attributed to the Armco 437-A which landed at approximately 1340 EST. The approach path of this aircraft to Middletown was from the northeast and the landing runway was on an azimuth of 0520. Although there is a discrepancy of approximately five minutes in the reported time of the sighting and landing of the aircraft, it is reasonable to assume that this small difference in time would not eliminate this as a cause of the report.

Observer stated that some did notice the aircraft that was landing. This offers more reason for concluding that the Armco jet with its landing lights on was the initial object sighted to the northeast. The aircraft at this time was far enough away that the landing lights would colliterate the smaller lights from the strobes and beacons. As the aircraft got closer the strobes and rotating beacons would have given the illusion of sparks and flashing as was reported.

The dull deep red glow is attributed to the aircraft lights on the runway (invisible from that location) or some ground lights on the opposite side of the river. The final phase of the sighting, consisting of lights rising and moving off to the northwest, cannot be explained in terms of this aircraft. At present the Air Force has been unable to locate any known object to account for this portion of her sighting. The pilot of the aircraft did not observe any unusual lights or other aircraft during his approach to the airport. A check was made with local radar networks and no unidentified tracks were observed on the night of 4 November. Contact was made with all known military agencies operating helicopter type aircraft in southwest Ohio, and the Air Force was unsuccessful in placing, any of these vehicles in the Middletown area at the time of her observation.

As such, the case will be carried as two separate observations. The first evaluated as an aircraft, and the second disappearing to the northwest remains unidentified.
