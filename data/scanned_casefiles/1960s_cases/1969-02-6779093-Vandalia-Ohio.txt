The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, specifically a "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE" form.

The text in the document is as follows:

5. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN X ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE PHENOMENA APPEARED ABOVE THE HORIZON WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT. PLACE A 0 ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE PHENOMENA WAS SEEN LAST. (Sketch included)

- page 4 -

The image contains three illustrations:

1. A compass rose diagram, with various directional labels such as North, East, South, and West.
2. A landscape illustration showing a road or path leading towards a horizon.
3. A smaller landscape illustration showing a road or path leading towards a horizon.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

AS NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE - PLACE AN X AT THE CENTER TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 5° ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 5° AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE X AND 5° WITH A LINE TO REPRESENT THE PATH OF THE PHENOMENON. IF THE PATH IS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
