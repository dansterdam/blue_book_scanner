Date:
Dear Sir:

31 Oct 66 McKeesRocks, Pa.

I want to write you about an object I had seen twice, on Oct. 21 1966, at about 2:50 P.M. and again at 3:30 P.M.

It was a clear, and sunny day. This occurred about 12 miles west of South Pittsburgh & Airport. I can not say of object made any sound for each time the object appeared there was no craft on the air.

It says I am going to continue to write our craft which appeared then before the object appeared, for the second time at about 10,000 - 12,000 FT.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

at about 5,000 ft having west towards
airport. When T-33 appeared to pass
under this object it became very bright
and just disappeared.

The document also contains compass direction letters (N, S, E, W) and some additional handwritten notes and diagrams with measurements like "7-10 x 1000 ft" and "5,000 ft", but the full text of those additional notes is partially illegible.
