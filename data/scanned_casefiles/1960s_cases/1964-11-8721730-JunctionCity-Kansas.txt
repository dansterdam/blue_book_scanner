Dear Sir:

My friend and I have been seeing strange objects flying over a hill near Junction City, Kansas. We see them go inside a ravine on the hill and come back out. When we got to investigate, there wasn't anything in the ravine, then we go back home and then we start doing things again. What should we do to find out where they land and where they come from.

We just have been wondering if space would send 12-14 year old kids into space. It isn't fair just letting adults to jump up that way. So we will be 2 years from now have always wanted to see what was on Venus, so we would

Like to know if you would send us if anybody into orbit or good write space.
We think you would want kids with good grades in school. We get good grades, especially in science. We get looks of science when we are in the library.
We will be writing for an answer.

Dear Messrs Whiteaker and Wolford:

This is in reply to your letter of November 5 in which you reported observing an unidentified flying object.

Attached is a copy of FTD Form 164. It is requested that you complete the Form as fully as possible and return it to this office for further evaluation.

With reference to your query on sending boys from 12 to 14 years of age into space, there are many requirements that have to be met by participants in the space program, one of the most predominant being a college education.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

Dear Sir:

We are sorry to say the last coverage we have lost the unidentified flying object form we were to fill out. We are wondering if you could spare another form to fill out. We are sorry to bother you like this but we don't think what you could read in this form.

What we would like to know is why would we need a college education, to just take a trip into space and back. We would like to know the university and we found in our town there was a lot in it with a lot of chemistry and mechanical gadget inside it. We took it, some kind of device inside.

In the corner was a type. We had a mechanical gadget inside it. We will be waiting for our answer.

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]
