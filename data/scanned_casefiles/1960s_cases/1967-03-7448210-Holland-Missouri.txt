PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT                NR 67-26                PAGE 1 OF 1     DATE OF REPORT 20 April 1967

SUBJECT    UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION   HOLLAND, MISSOURI                   DATE   10 March 1967

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF                                            IR                      QUALITY   Poor
P NRS     One roll 8 mm motion picture film (color)

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 67-14, submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, requesting an analysis of a roll of 8 mm motion picture film which allegedly contains photography of an unidentified flying object.

2. ANALYSIS: The entire roll of film was scanned and was found to be blank with the exception of approximately 11 feet, within this footage are two small, roughly circular bright spot images. A detailed photographic analysis of these images is not possible due to the lack of camera data, specifically focal length and range to the subject.

3. An examination of the film by a photo processing specialist reveals several similar circular bright spot images occurring outside of the normal frame area. On the entire roll of film there is no evidence of the frame lines which would be expected on a normally exposed 8 mm motion picture film. This raises the possibility that the film was not exposed or was run through a camera where the light path from the lens to the film was obstructed.

4. Further analysis could possibly be accomplished if more data was furnished in regard to the comments in Paragraphs 2 and 3.

SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO:    TDETR, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. Reference our message DCOI 04018 Mar 67, subject same as above.

2. Forwarded for your information and exploitation is a roll of 8mm movie film which is alleged to contain photography of the same or a similar UFO as that reported in the referenced message. The film was exposed on 10 March 1967 by Mr. [redacted] who provided the information in the original report. At the time of the original report, Mr. [redacted] advised that he would attempt to photograph the object and, if successful, would release the film to this organization. The enclosed film was obtained from Mr. [redacted] on 23 March 1967.

3. Mr. [redacted] was unable to describe the camera or to provide any information as to the type of camera or lenses, the lens opening or shutter speeds or processing method, except to say that the camera was "borrowed" and "wide open".

4. The enclosed film was reviewed on 23 March 1967 but available technical equipment does not permit further exploitation or a logical conclusion as to the cause of this sighting.

5. A brief evaluation of this film would be appreciated. Further, Mr. [redacted] requests the return of the original film when exploitation has been completed.

10 March 67

SAF-OICC/Mrs Cassel/bp/T9079/18 May 67

MAY 18 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Thank you for submitting your roll of 8 mm movie film for evaluation.

The entire roll of film was found to be blank with the exception of approximately 11 feet. Within the footage are two images. A detailed photographic analysis of these images is not possible due to the lack of camera data.

On the entire roll of film there is no evidence of the frame which would be expected on a normally exposed 8 mm motion picture film. This raises the possibility that the film was not exposed or was run through a camera where the light path from the lens to the film was obstructed.

Photographic analysis reached the conclusion the film does not contain photography of the same or similar unidentified flying object (UFO) as first believed.

Your interest in our program is appreciated. Your film is enclosed.

Sincerely,

[Signature block]
