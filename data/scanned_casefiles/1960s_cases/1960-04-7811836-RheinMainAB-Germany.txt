The text in the document reads:

The preceding article is certain to provide readers with the Seventh Air Division support group. A study of the evidence available. According to the indications given, there seem to be no conclusions that the phenomena concerned were caused by any well-known or accepted natural causes. The body of evidence indicates the existence of physical phenomena which cannot be explained by conventional methods and in which there seems to be no evidence of fraud or hoax.

There is no physical evidence, such as materials or photographs.
