AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY OF ACTIVITY REPORTING: West Germany
COUNTRY OR AREA REPORT CONCERNS: West Germany
DATE OF INFORMATION: 13 Apr 60
DATE OF COLLECTION: 14-20 Apr 60
DATE OF REPORT: 21 Apr 60

PREPARING INDIVIDUAL: Dept. F. E. GOTCH

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING REPORT

SUMMARY:
In unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported sighted from Rhein Main Air Base, Germany on 13 Apr 60. People in the vicinity from local agencies, including the primary air control organizations, reported the object was an unusual aerial phenomenon. For an unusually clear observation, this object was other than an ordinary image. The most logical explanation is that the light emanates from a descending object at a distance and was too common an occurrence to impress any other character(s).

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Subject: UFO Sighting Report.

a. The following is the description of the UFO which is the subject of this report:

(1) The shape was round, and (2) the size was that of a medium to large aircraft. (3) The color was uniform and a light yellow. (4) The speed was estimated at 100-300 knots. (5) The direction was from Southeast to Northwest. (6) The altitude would be discussed only if the UFO is confirmed.

b. (1) The observer's observation was first estimated by the sergeant of the North American Air Defense Command. (2) He observed the UFO above the horizon between 250° and 270° azimuth. (3) Observed for about 2 minutes. (4) At 21 degrees above the horizon. (5) He was using binoculars. (6) The sighting was before closing the station.

c. (1) The observation was made from the ground by individual at a building. (2) Without benefit of an optical aid.

d. (1) The time was 0325 on 13 April 1960. (2) It was a dark night, with some stars visible.

e. The observer was situated atop the civilian terminal building on the north side of Rhein Main Base (50°16'N & 50°02'E).

f. The observer was A/2c [partially redacted text].

g. (1) The witness described the weather as clear and calm with clouds to the South and Southwest. Visibility was good. (2) Rhein Main and Wiesbaden weather reports noted: [multiple weather coordinates and measurements listed]

h. There was no unusual activity or conditions, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, which might explain the sighting.

i. No interception or identification action was taken.

j. The following agencies were contacted to determine whether any air traffic could explain the sighting: [list of agencies including Air Force, Air Defense, and other military units]

Here is the OCR text from the document:

a. The preparing officer is Captain Francis R. Gotchy, the Ground Training Officer From the Operations section of the 7310th Support Group.

A study of the evidence available, including taped conversations between traffic and Approach Control (and the tower) at Rhein Main, with information to Rhein Main.

The only air traffic close to the time interval concerned was P11 at 0927, a freighter inbound to Frankfurt Airport. Then another P11 at 1130, a freighter near Wiesbaden, reported to Frankfurt approach, enroute to the Rhein Main area.

Radar reported his 20 NM north of the field. At 0037E he reported 170°. Radar placed him 11 NM Northeast. At 0032E he reported reaching 170°. Radar was working a/c 1260, then 2700, then 1260 for a landing on runway 26R. Aircraft landed at 0036E.

Captain [redacted] saw a ball about 1/10th, stated it is general practice in the Frankfurt area to better distinguish landing beacons. There was no unusual activity noted. Night conditions must be considered, with estimates of altitude and airspeed under such conditions inconsistent with even a very low altitude. The thin visual range and sound was the determining factor in operation of the azimuth and ventilation unit on the roof. The variance between the azimuth of the ball light and the bearing of the aircraft could be a partial disorientation of the observer under the night conditions.

A significant factor in the formation of the conclusion is the absence of other reports from the locally populated Frankfurt area of any unusual occurrence. Such a lack of reporting might be expected to occur quite frequently in the vicinity of a busy airport.

c. There is no physical evidence, such as materials or photographs.
