UFO Observation, 23 Sep 69

Mentor, Ohio 44060

1. Reference your UFO sighting of 23 Sep 69. The description you have provided of your sighting is consistent with past reports we have received of satellite observations. Since you indicated that the object was first seen in the south and last seen in the southwest sky, we can link the observation to probably being one of the retrograde satellites. There are approximately 20 retrograde satellites now visible to the naked eye. Unfortunately, we are unable to say which one or because satellites you probably observed.

2. Thank you for your cooperation and for reporting your sighting to the Air Force.

SUBJECT: UFO Observation

1 Oct 69, received a call from:
[Observatory name and contact details are blacked out]

Sighted satellite-like object in NW sky at 9:17 p.m. EDT(1/01172)
30Sept.

+1 minute. Object observed to travel south to north and pass within
2° of Beta Lyra. Angular velocity estimated to be 1/2 to 1 degrees/sec
and estimated visibility (naked eye) stellar magnitude +3. Object
observed through 6 inch reflecting telescope and observed to be of
4 star-like images. First was about +3 to +4 magnitude followed by
3 that were approximately +4 to +5 magnitude. Observer estimated that
from first to last would be approximately 1 degree spread. Observer
called Mr. Citron of Smithsonian. Mr. Citron reportedly stated that he
felt that observation must have been of a polar satellite launched from
Vandenberg AFB within 24 hours of sighting. Would like to be contacted
between 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. EDT this afternoon.

MEMO FOR RECORD                                                6 Oct.

SUBJECT:  UFO Observation

On 1 Oct 69, called Mr. Vealholder (spelling?)(Space Systems MTD)
and gave preceding information to him. Will call back with answer
to:

1. Was there a satellite launch from Vandenburg in
24 hours preceding sighting.

2. Identity of satellite.

Lt Toby will handle.

Beta Lyra approximately at azimuth 260°; elevation 6°.

1420 hours
1 Oct 69

Lt Toby called to say that there was a launch from Vandenburg within
the previous 24 hours of the sighting (time not given to Lt Toby) of a
multiple payload satellite that would correlate with sighting quite well
except should have been seen at 0017Z instead of 0117Z. I asked Lt Toby
if Vandenburg could have made a mistake in their calculation of the time.
He said they said they had double checked it for him.

Lt Toby called back to say that the launch from Vandenburg put 11 objects
in orbit. The first object was in a low orbit and passed over area about
1 hour before the sighting. The other 10 went into a higher orbit and would
have been visible from his area at 0117Z on the 7th orbit. They were
relatively close at that time and had a slow separation velocity. They were
in a polar orbit.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES SEPTEMBER 15-21, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those previously in Daily Weather Map. Additional copies may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Public Inquiries Section, AB-246, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may be ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, at a cost of 15 cents per 50 copies. Checks should be payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by chains of arrows, the locations of these centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are used here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analysis is based. Such additional information may be obtained from the printed station data and the analyses.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values to the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart shows, by means of shading, the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. Amounts in inches at the nearest hundredth or in total are given. The period. Isohyetal lines are under foot. * indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES SEPTEMBER 8-14, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts in the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar Chart, the Higher and Lower Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copies from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map.

Copies may be obtained by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Public Inquiries Section, AW 145, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Such copies may be mailed from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402 at a cost of 15-75 or 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the average for 700 a.m., local time, for the preceding 6 to 12 and 18 hour crosses. Areas of high and low pressure are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of snowfall are indicated by the weather reports that are plotted. Note that a fraction of these but not included in the occasional weather maps, and on which this analysis is based. Occlusal and frontal systems are shown.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and centers of the 500 millibar level, at 700 a.m., local time. The height lines are drawn at 60 meter intervals.

The height contours are shown to give an idea of the general circulation of the atmosphere.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m. local time. The names of the reporting points can be found in the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is located above the station temperature, and the minimum temperature is located below this point.

The Precipitation Area and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the total precipitation for the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are shown as a zero or less. Dashes indicate a trace, the depth of precipitation is shown in inches as 0.05 or 1/20 of the amount of the day.

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1969

The rest of the text in the image is too small or illegible to read clearly. The image appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric map with curved lines, contours, and various markings, including a "HIGH" label in the upper right area of the map.


- page 51 -

There is no readable text on this page. The image appears to contain two sections of diagrams or charts with curved lines, contour lines, and various markings. The top section shows a more scattered pattern of lines and dots, while the bottom section shows more defined curved lines and contour-like markings. The right side of the page contains what looks like scattered dots or small markings. The image is in black and white and appears to be a technical or scientific diagram.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1969

The rest of the text is too small or illegible to accurately transcribe. The image appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric map with contour lines, various markings, and what seem to be data points scattered across the map.


- page 53 -

There is no readable text on this page. The image contains three different charts or maps:

1. A top chart with curved lines and some small markings
2. A middle chart with curved contour lines and some letters (L, H)
3. A right-side chart with scattered dot-like markings

The charts appear to be meteorological or geographical in nature, possibly showing weather patterns, topographical features, or data distribution. However, no legible text is present in the image.

There is no readable text on this page. The image appears to contain several diagrams or maps with contour lines, curved lines, and scattered small markings or notations. The diagrams seem to be topographical or scientific in nature, with one section showing more dense contour lines and another section with more scattered markings.


- page 61 -

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1969

The rest of the text appears to be part of weather maps or charts with contour lines, low pressure areas marked, and various numerical annotations. Due to the technical nature of the image, most of the specific numerical details are too small or blurry to accurately transcribe.


- page 62 -

The image appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric chart with multiple layers of contour lines and annotations. Some visible text includes:

"LOW"
"100"
"200"

The chart seems to show atmospheric pressure systems or weather patterns, with curved lines representing different meteorological features. The top portion shows a broader view with "LOW" marked, while the bottom portion shows a more detailed contour map with more intricate line patterns.

The right side of the image contains what looks like a scattered set of numerical annotations or data points.

The overall image is a black and white technical diagram or chart, likely related to meteorology or atmospheric science.

TO ASSIST IN ESTIMATING ANGULAR SIZE: HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR TELEPHONE POLE. COMPARE THE WIDTH OF THE MATCH HEAD TO THE WIDTH OF THE OBJECT. IF YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE MATCH HEAD WOULD HAVE COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
