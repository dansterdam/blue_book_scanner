UFO INVESTIGATION, 23 Sep 69

EAST LAKE, OHIO 44094

1. In reference your UFO sighting of 23 Sep 69. The information you have provided is consistent with reports we have received of satellite observations. These and similar incidents are common-place and can easily be attributed to the many satellite and space vehicles now in orbit. We can limit the observation to probably being one of the many satellites currently in operation.

2. Thank you for your cooperation and for reporting your sighting to the Air Force.

MEMO FOR RECORD 
SUBJECT: UFO Observation

1 Oct 69, received a call from: [redacted] Observatory
AGCOT-587-8125

Sighted satellite-like object in NW sky at 9:17 p.m. EDT (1/10/72).
- Object observed to travel south to north and pass within 20 or Berea Spyn. Angular velocity estimated to be 1/2 to 1 degree/sec and estimated visibility (naked eye) stellar magnitude +3. Object observed through 6 inch reflecting telescope and observed to be of 4 star-like images. First was about +3 to +4 magnitude followed by 3 that were approximately +4 to +5 magnitudes. Observer estimated that from first to last would approximately 1 degree spread. Observer called Mr. Citron of Smithsonian. Mr. Citron reportedly stated that he felt that observation must have been of a polar satellite launched from Vandenberg AFB within 24 hours of sighting. Would like to be contacted between 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. EDT this afternoon.

MEMO FOR RECORD 
SUBJECT: UFO Observation

On 1 Oct 69, called Mr. Vealholler (spelling?)(Space Systems FTD) and gave preceding information to him. Will call back with answer to:

1. Was there a satellite launch from Vandenburg in 24 hours preceding sighting.
2. Identity of satellite.
It Toby will handle.
Both Lyra approximately at azimuth 260°; elevation 6°.

1425 hours 
1 Oct 69

Lt Toby called to say that there was a launch from Vandenburg within the previous 24 hours of the sighting (time not given to Lt Toby) of a multiple payload satellite that would correlate with sighting quite well. Engine should have been seen at 0117Z instead of 0117. I asked Lt Toby if Vandenburg could have made a mistake in their calculation of the time. He said that they said they had double checked it for him.

Lt Toby came back to say that the launch from Vandenburg put 11 objects in orbit. The first object was in a low orbit and passed over near about 1 hour before the sighting. The other 10 went into a higher orbit and would have been visible from his area at 0117Z on the 7th orbit. They were relatively close at that time and had a slow separation velocity. They were in a polar orbit.

OCR Text Output:
DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES SEPTEMBER 22-28, 1969

The charts in this publication are a contribution to the meteorological service of the Weather Bureau publication.

The Weather Map. They indicate the surface weather conditions at a specific time of the day, usually at 7:00 AM EST. The three Weather Maps, the 500-millibar map, the 700 millibar map, and the surface weather map provide a synoptic picture of the weather conditions over a large area.

All of the charts for one day are produced on a single sheet for convenience. They are printed in black and white. Contours or isopleths are shown as solid lines. Above sea level, the isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 700 millibar level.

The Surface Weather Map presents the actual weather conditions over the country at the time shown. The fronts of well-defined depressions or anticyclones are drawn in the conventional manner. The centers of highs and lows are labeled as to their character and minimum or maximum values as appropriate.

The 500-millibar Chart presents the contour pattern of the constant pressure surface at that level. This chart depicts the upper air flow pattern, and indicates the development and movement of major weather systems.

The 700-millibar Chart presents a similar constant pressure chart, but at a lower level in the atmosphere. It is useful in weather analysis and forecasting.

Checks should be drawn payable to the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. Single copies may be obtained from the Weather Bureau, 5200 Auth Road, Suitland, Md. 20023. Subscriptions to the Weekly Series of Daily Weather Maps are available at a cost of $8.00 for the season, or $28.00 per year, from the Superintendent of Documents.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES: SEPTEMBER 15-21, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the series of daily weather maps published during the period indicated. Surface Weather Map the 500 Millibar Chart, and the 700 and 850 Millibar Charts are included. The surface frontal positions and other surface weather details are shown on the surface weather map. The 500 Millibar Chart shows the contours of the 500-millibar surface. The 700 and 850 Millibar Charts show the contours of the 700 and 850-millibar surfaces.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis based on this data. The analyses show as a mass of arrows where the wind directions and speeds are indicated. The pressure systems are shown as closed lines, and are labeled with the pressure in millibars. The temperature field is shown by lines of constant temperature (isotherms), and the arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 850-millibar level. The stations are identified by their indices, and the temperature, dewpoint, pressure, etc. for each station are given.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the 500-millibar contour field. The contour lines are labeled in decameters (dam) above sea level. The isotherm field is shown by lines of constant temperature, and the winds are indicated by flags, barbs and pennants on the chart. The 700 and 850 Millibar Charts show similar contour fields for the 700 and 850-millibar surfaces.

The notes on the map tell how to obtain these charts and related weather products. Copies may be obtained through the Environmental Data Service, C3, NOAA, Asheville, N.C. 28801. Only a limited number of copies are available.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES: SEPTEMBER 8-14, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the weather maps published by the Weather Bureau publication, "Daily Weather Map". The purpose is to provide a historical continuity of the surface map charts from the 1500-mb (60,000-foot) constant pressure charts and to provide a surface analysis. These charts have not been reproduced from the same negatives used in the Daily Weather Map publication, but have been specially prepared from the station data available at the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce.

The Surface Weather Map presents a synoptic chart of the analyzed surface pattern over the contiguous United States and adjacent coastal waters. The tracks of well-defined pressure systems, frontal positions, and areas of precipitation are indicated by conventional symbols. The isobars are drawn at 4-mb intervals, and values of pressure at the centers of highs and lows are indicated. The Surface Weather Map also shows the 500-mb height contours, which are indicative of the upper-air pattern.

The 500-mb Height Contour Map presents a synoptic chart of the 500-mb (18,000-foot) constant pressure surface over the contiguous United States and adjacent areas. The heights of the 500-mb surface, in tens of feet, are contoured at 60-foot intervals. This chart provides a graphic representation of the major wind flow patterns in the middle troposphere.

The Surface Weather Map and the 500-mb Height Contour Map are normally published as part of the Daily Weather Map series. Copies may be obtained from the Environmental Data Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Public Information Section, C51, 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado 80302. Price: $0.30 per weekly series.
