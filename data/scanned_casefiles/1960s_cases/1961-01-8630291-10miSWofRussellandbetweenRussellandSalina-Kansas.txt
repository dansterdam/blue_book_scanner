11. COMMENTS
Witnesses were separated by approx 70 NM and all saw the same object at the same time, which indicates object must have been at very high altitude. Description and duration is characteristic of a meteor. Witnesses reported hearing an explosion. Some meteors called bolides enter the earth's atmosphere, almost reach the earth's surface and explode. The explosion is so intense that it can be heard for miles. These types of meteors are fairly rare; and when they are seen and heard, startle average observer.
