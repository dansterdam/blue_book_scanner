Dear Sirs,

I saw a saucer at Brenham High School and a student of the school, and Physics teacher Mr. Yancey, observed it also. The saucer was circular in shape and about 30 feet in diameter. It was hovering about 50 feet above the ground. I realize that nearly all can be reasonably explained. I don't want it to tongue in with my faith, but I must tell you of the incident that took place at Brenham, Texas, on Sept. 5, 1964.

As we talked suddenly, the entire area became lighted up and the object rose straight up with a light which appeared to me to be green. It hovered momentarily, then rapidly dwindled from sight. My car had just a short time before could not get over 90 miles, reasonable explanation for the incident.

Text extracted from the document:

Light,

If you have an explanation please let me know. The things that are experienced during these lights may at times seem strange but excuse me may go into theory. Theories are made to be tested and if found inaccurate should be dropped. The explosion of stars is caused by the expansions or contraction of gases. The light must travel through space and matter but we know that light enters the atmosphere is absorbed and refracted. Some of it the earth and some reflected into space. If this light, whatever it may be, goes through anything (the matter ray) and that you can see it, may the reflection here of a portion of ray. There is one of my profession and that is to give you the facts without bias. May the whole please let me know. Please let me know any information that can help.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
