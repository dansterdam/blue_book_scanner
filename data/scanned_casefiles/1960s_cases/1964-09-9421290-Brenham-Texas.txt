Route 2
Brenham Texas
Sept. 5, 1964

Dear Sirs:

I am a senior at Brenham High School and a student of Physics. I have studied various cases of U.F.Os and I realize that nearly all can be reasonably explained.

About 11:35 tonight while sitting in my car with my Girlfriend in front of her house a point ½ mile somewhat of Brenham this event occurred.

As we talked suddenly the entire area as far as I could see was as bright as day with a light which appeared to me to be green. It faded away swiftly, growing dimmer and dimmer. I stepped from my car but could see no "reasonable explanation for the

light.
-If you have an explanation
please let me know.
Now sir if you will excuse
me may I offer an theory.
"Grashers Theory"
I feel such lights could be caused
by the explosion of stars 1000s of
eight years away. The light must
travel through space and since
there are few particles or little
atmosphere and gaseous is not
seen until it hits the earths
atmosphere. My theory includes
that light will take stand, can
go through anything (the laser ray)
I think light is not visible
and that you can see only the
reflection there of
This is just one of many of my
old ideas if you have proof I
may be wrong please let me know.
Please self me any information
that will help.
Sincerely,
