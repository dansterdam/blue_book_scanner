14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The light went with distance as we watched. I could see the light near new horizon until the horizon blocked my vision. It went to the end of the sky. I watched it for quite a while. You might compare it to a height of the sky as it was fading out.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: For a short time I couldn't see it because I was driving, looking off a suitable place past the car off the highway.

If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? A very small area, the match stick would have been to small to compare a size.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A hand-drawn sketch is present with accompanying text describing the object's shape and movement]

The light was first seen at the shape of a ball, and possibly compare to the first from a roman candle fire. Woke after it in returning to the ground. I think it was very far away with tremendous speed. Some slow, suddenly tilted the drop and going down, momentarily to steady altitude, gliding toward the ground. I also think the object was light on at the beginning of the flash. Otherwise I would have noticed it before.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Part of it would be covered, but you could see the ing it all around the head of the match

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    12    April    1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Doris and I were discussing outer space objects earlier probably twenty minutes before we saw it. During the conversation Doris said, "If a girl what would anybody do if anything from outer space landed on earth." I then told her - I wouldn't be afraid, it would be fun to meet someone, or hide and watch, that I would never attempt violence, I would like to be the one to make friends with them.

From this I think the UFO came turn-in on a conversation. Otherwise why yes, and while we were walking west would be on friendly terms in such a case, but as it turned out we were both afraid and wanted to get away from it. That is why while we were watching it I turned out the lights, then for the past nights, so that it wouldn't see us, for fear it may do something to us.
