The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, but it does not contain any photographs. It is a Project 10073 Record form that provides details about a reported sighting of a SATELLITE (ECHO II) object moving 35 degrees above the horizon in Preble County, Ohio on March 26, 1966. The form captures information such as the date, time, location, source, number of objects, length of observation, type of observation (ground-visual), course, and lack of physical evidence. The form also mentions that the object appeared to be moving at a high speed.

It was a bright light, a fluorescent light, something like a hanging light, that a dim glow about it but it remained stationary and steady didn't move or blink or do anything just hung there. It was about the size of a baseball size at arm's length and had a fuzzy halo effect or fuzzy glow around it - no defined edges. It seemed to be at a high altitude, not like an aircraft or anything moving. Appeared to be over the surrounding countryside but couldn't tell exact distance or size since there were no reference points nearby.

My imagination could nct grasp whit it was—a thing that seemed ooze and pulsate and seem alive—but it did not—look like any machine or device I have ever seen or even imagined. It seems to be on the same plane as my sauoerand then suddenly disappear. I got a strange feeling—a feeling of wonder and awev—I cannot describe in words the impression it made on me. I have never seen anything like it before and I doubt if I will ever see anything like it again.
33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? 
22 Date Month March 1966 Year shortly after sighting

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document that contains a questionnaire or form to be filled out.

Text transcribed from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. It seemed to fade out.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes / No / Don't Know. If you answered yes, what did it move behind?

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes / No / Don't Know. If you answered yes, what did it move in front of?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None
b. Color: White, light like a star

18. We wish to know the angular size: Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
I can't tell how large the object was in terms of the match head

19. Draw a picture of the object or objects you saw. Label and include the following information: the shape of the object, its color, its size in relation to the known object used for angular measurement, and especially show the direction the object was moving.
This object moved without a trail and appeared and disappeared.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 12 April 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
Dusk and I were discussing when suddenly we saw an object, apparently twenty minutes later we saw it again. The conversation took place with one or two other persons. It was what we would call a night light and would move somewhat, and appear and disappear, and would at times permit a closer view. Attempts were made to find out more by telephone calls, but were unsuccessful.
From this I think the USAF can have as complete an investigation as may be possible. Otherwise why not and which may be satisfactory in this case, and may be warranted in other visits to this area. That is about all there is to be said, that is the way it was.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and sketches related to UFO observations. The diagram shows an angle measurement system, with different angles labeled from 90 degrees to 0 degrees. The sketch at the bottom shows a path with two points labeled "A" and "B", indicating the motion of an observed object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the curve to show where you first saw the object. Place a "D" on the curve where you last saw the object.

90°  A  75°
60°
45°  C 30°
15°
0° 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

A                  B

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
