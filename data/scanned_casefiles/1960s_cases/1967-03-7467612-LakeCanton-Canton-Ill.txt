Canton, Illinois
March 25, 1967

To Whom it may concern:

This is in regards to the shrouded UFO mystery that has puzzled many over the years, including my immediate family. During the past few years we have accumulated many articles, stories, books etc., describing various aspects of the UFO. To those who know nothing or very little about these things, we are extremely interested in those things out are cautious of being misled with false information and crank reports.

Our small home lies on the shores of Lake Canton about three miles due East of the City of Canton, geographically located such that we have a fairly good view of the outlying country-side in all directions.

Like many, one of our chief desires is to some day (or night) see closer up, and in full view without obstruction, a UFO. Many times we have observed very unusual objects in the sky, as we watch for them constantly. Most of our sightings have been at night, but a few have been observed during the day-light hours. Each time we have observed an object we carefully try to analyze what we saw-to be certain it is-or is not-an airplane, weather balloon, a satellite, the planet Venus, swarms of insects or some gas. None of my family have suffered from hallucinations, are healthy, quite and are not experiencing headaches.

Each of our sightings have not been recorded or reported to anyone, for very obvious reasons--we don't like being made a spectacle, or called a liar by some person called an authority on the subject. We feel we are as much an authority until proven otherwise. I could give you general description of the previous sightings, but we feel you would consider this evidence as inadequate, or useless, as you have no doubt received many such comparable reports. However, we feel this report we are now submitting may be significant and have merit as useful material toward the unveiling of the UFO mystery.

Yesterday evening March 25, 1967 at approximately 6:25 P.M. took his newly purchased glider airplane, (the type purchased at the local S and 104 store for $94) out into the yard to fly. He was throwing the plane into a gentle breeze, trying only to make it glide to a proper landing, but not trying to make it do the usual high gloss as these small planes are capable.

The weather was damp and humid with heavy overcast (extremely cloudy--temperature about 750). Earlier, it had been raining lightly. It was getting quite dark and finding his plane in the darkness. He was having difficulty finding his plane in the darkness. He decided to give his plane one last hard throw, before coming into the house. The plane made a high loop into the air and as it went up it was hard to see it and there hovering above him was a huge motionless, egg shaped object.

Frightened at what he was seeing, he immediately tried to call out to someone, but momentarily, was unable to utter a sound. Finally, he was able to scream out to me and I came running on the fly as I could tell by the urgency in his voice that something was wrong. As I quickly approached where he was standing, I frantically pointed and asked, "Do you see that?" I took the North-Westerly direction he was pointing. I immediately saw a bright red pulsating lighted object speeding rapidly low over the fields, quickly disappearing over the horizon out of sight.

Detailing this was the tie to submit an official report, I brought into the house to go over what I had observed. One of the first things I did was to look his story over.

I was very shaken, frightened and hardly able to think for a time.

I said the object made a sound like a very quiet machine-grinding and still more like a sound for quite a while. When the first looked out to see the object, he said when he first looked in to see the object, here was this noise like. He said when he first looked in to see the object, he was more or less still, but it gradually began to grow till it reached a bright red with such intensity that it was to glow in it. Also, he observed that as the intensity of the light grew, so did the motor.

With this, the motor became more small, but not louder. The motor also pulsed with the light unless. (it was the kind we know, but also, I was reading just inside the open door, and also had observed this sound, but likewise as David, gave it no thought)....

Being an Amateur Radio (ham) Operator, I have a tower that is 63 feet high in our yard. I said the object was about the same distance over his head as our tower. I said I could see a bright, sharp light, and was going to crash into some nearby tree-tops, but apparently missed them. I asked about the size of the object and his reply was "gosh Dad, it was bigger than our house". Then, I said: "At first it was light, he said it was no windows or doors, and that it was at first a solid distinct dark object against the clouds, until it began so quickly slow a solid very bright red rapidly pulsating and then away it went".

I said when the object said away it traveled toward the tree-tops and as soon as it was a little over the trees, it appeared to make a very sharp turn from its northerly direction to take up a course toward the north-east. When I observed it, it was heading in the north-easterly direction quickly going out of sight. I would estimate its elevation above the earth at about 100 and no more than 200 feet.

I asked him if he had any unusual feelings when he observed the object over his head, or whether he felt it affected him at any time, even at the line of it's brightest intensity, or if he felt any heat from it. He said he experienced nothing unusual other than the intensity of the light hurting his eyes the same as the strong headlights of an automobile.

Please consider this as the true statements of the undersigned:

This image is a detailed road map of central Illinois, showing numerous towns, highways, and geographical features. The map includes cities such as Peoria, Canton, Havana, Lincoln, and many smaller towns. There are several marked areas labeled with circles and numbers, including a "Sighting Area" near Canton and a "Restricted Area R-3301". The map shows roads, rivers (including the Illinois River), and appears to be from a vintage era, likely from the 1960s based on the context of the Project Blue Book file. The map covers a significant portion of central Illinois, with grid lines and various notations throughout.
