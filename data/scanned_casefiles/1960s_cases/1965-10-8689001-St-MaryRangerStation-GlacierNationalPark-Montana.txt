Mrs Hunt/sb/SAFOTCC/2784/13 Jan 66

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you observed on the night of October 1, 1965.

The duration, direction of flight, and general description are characteristic of a re-entry characteristic of a satellite component or space debris. A check with SPACETRACK indicated that no such object was scheduled for re-entry at that time. However, it is possible that you observed the re-entry of one of the smaller components of space debris upon which no track is maintained.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING

Reference the attached letter requesting information on unidentified flying objects. A check with SPADATS indicated that no satellite or satellite component or space debris was trackable for re-entry during the time period which would have been indicated. The duration, direction of flight, and general description in accord with a re-entry observation. It is possible that observers re-entry or one of the smaller components of space debris upon which no track is maintained.

Dear Sir,

On October 1, 1965 at approximately 9:55 p.m. a friend of mine stated we believe we saw something flying and of too long duration to be a shooting star. The observation was yellowish, almost as dark as the moon that night.

The duration of travel was from northwest to southeast. The shape of the light remained we of a glowing head of orange-some what tear shaped but leaving a white trail.

We stored this event from St. Mary Ranger Station, Glacier National Park, Montana. The speed was hard by either one of us, probably a possible, because it was very widely. Duration of observance was about 3 seconds. If this input have been receiving space vehicle component and you are interested in continuing either of the with
