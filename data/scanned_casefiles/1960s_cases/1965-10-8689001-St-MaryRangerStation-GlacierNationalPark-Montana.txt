DEAR MR. â€”

This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you sighted on or about October 1, 1965. 

The duration, direction of flight, and general description of the object were noted. A careful search of our records has failed to reveal any information which would substantiate that this particular object was man-made or artificial. It is indicated that no such object was tracked on radar or visual observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. I trust this information is helpful.

Sincerely,
JOHN L AULDING

Dear sir, 
This report is in reference to a strange phenomenon which was observed by members of the St. Mary Ranger Station at Glacier National Park, Montana. The object of the light appeared to be of a glowing nature and was described as being circular in shape. Its size was estimated to be approximately 20-30 feet in diameter. The object was observed for a period of about 3 minutes as it hovered and maneuvered in the sky. No sound was associated with the object. The object eventually accelerated and disappeared from sight. This report is being submitted for your information and further investigation as deemed necessary.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
