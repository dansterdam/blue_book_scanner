4 OBSERVATIONS OCCURRED IN A 30 MINUTE TIME PERIOD. FOUR

SEPARATE DESCRIPTIONS BY COMPETENT OBSERVERS OFFER RELATED DESCRIP

TIONS. PROBABLY EACH OBSERVATION WAS MADE OF ONE AND THE SAME OBJECT.

DECRIPTIONS VARIATIONS COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSEDSBY THE FACT THAT ALL

OBSERVATION OCCURRED AT NIGHT WITH NO VISIBLE REFERENCES TO GUAGE

THE DISTANCE AND ACTUAL SIZE CORRECTLY. NO REPORTS WERE RECEIVED

OF ANY FALLEN OBJECT OR OTHER PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO BE MEASURED AS

A WEATHER BALLOON, WHICH WAS EITHER SELF ILLUMINATED OR REFLECTED
MOON LIGHT, AN AIRCRAFT WITH LANDING LIGHTS ON OR A REFUELING TANKER
AIRCRAFT ILLUMINATING A DRONE AIRCRAFT, ALL OF THIS SEEN AT SUCH
DISTANCE IN THE DARK NIGHT TO HINDER CLEAR PERCEPTION AND IDENTIFICATION.

MOVEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO THE OBJECT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY VERY FAR
DISTANT CLOUDS PASSING BEFORE THE OBJECT. SEE THE AIR ALMANAC
1964 FOR MAY JULY WHICH OFFERS EVENING STAR DIAGRAMS FOR VENUS
MARS JUPITER AND SATURN. OBSERVATION AT SURFACE LEVEL AT 34
MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE, OR CLOVIS NMEX, LOOKING WEST
BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 1900 AND 2100 MOUNTAIN STANDARD TIME IN MAY
1964 WOULD REVEAL VENUS BUT NONE OF THE OTHER PLANETS. VENUS IS
BETWEEN 290 AND 300 DEGREES AND DISAPPEARS BELOW THE HORIZON AT
2100 TO 2300 HOURS MSG. OBSERVATIONS OF VENUS MAY HAVE BEEN MADE.

AN AIRCRAFT COULD HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT. SEE THE USAF/USN LOW ALTITUDE
HIGH SPEEDSTRAINING ROUTE CHART, WESTERN, EFFECTIVE 19 APRIL 1964
THAT DESCRIBES THE SAC LOW LEVEL ROUTE "ZERO HOUR" AT 6,000 FT MSL
FROM SANTA ROSZ, 347N 10429W TO BOISE CITY, OKL, 4649N 10235W,
USED BY WALKER AFB (SAC). SEE CANNON AFB REFUELING AREAS (AAR):
