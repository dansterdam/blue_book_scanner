The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document from the U.S. Air Force regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The document describes the sighting of a "weather balloon, which was either self illuminated or reflected MOON LIGHT, an aircraft with landing lights on or a refueling tanker aircraft illumination a drone aircraft" that was observed at a distance in the dark night, making it difficult to perceive and identify.

The text of the document is as follows:

INCOMING MESSAGE
PAGE THREE RUWGBH 111 UNCLAS AF IN 57388 (27 MAY 64) PAGE 3 OF 3
A WEATHER BALLOON, WHICH WAS EITHER SELF ILLUMINATED OR REFLECTED MOON LIGHT, AN AIRCRAFT WITH LANDING LIGHTS ON OR A REFUELING TANKER AIRCRAFT ILLUMINATION A DRONE AIRCRAFT, ALL OF THIS SEEN AT SUCH DISTANCE IN THE DARK NIGHT TO HINDER CLEAR PERCEPTION AND IDENTIFICATION. MOVEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO THE OBJECT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY VERY FAR DISTANT CLOUDS PASSING BEFORE THE OBJECT. SEE THE AIR ALMANAC 1964 FOR MAY JULT WHICH OFFERS EVENING STAR DIAGRAMS FOR VENUS MARS JUPITER AND SATURN. OBSERVATION AT SURFACE LEVEL AT 34 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE, OR CLOVIS NMEX, LOOKING WEST BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 1920 AND 2100 MOUNTAIN STANDARD TIME IN MAY 1964 WOULD REVEAL VENUS BUT NONE OF THE OTHER PLANETS. VENUS IS BETWEEN 290 AND 300 DEGREES AND DISAPPEARS BELOW THE HORIZON AT 2100 TO 2300 HOURS MSG. OBSERVATIONS OF VENUS MAY HAVE BEEN MADE. AN AIRCRAFT COULD HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT.
