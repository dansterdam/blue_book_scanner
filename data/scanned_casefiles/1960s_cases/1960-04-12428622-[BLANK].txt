was rising at about that time.

Looking at the sky, he saw a huge, silent, motionless luminous mass, apparently suspended above the north bank of the river some 300 yards away. "It looked," he said, "like a gigantic cigar standing on end. I had been watching this amazing spectacle for a couple of minutes when suddenly from the bottom of the cigar came an object like a horizontal disk, which dropped at first in free fall, then slowed, and suddenly swayed and dived horizontally across the river toward me, becoming very luminous. For a very short time I could see the disk full-face; it was surrounded by a halo of brilliant light."

A few minutes after it had disappeared behind him, going southwest at prodigious speed, a similar object came from the cigar and went through the same maneuvers. A third object, and then a fourth—and finally a fifth detached itself from the cigar which was still motionless. This last disk dropped lower than the earlier ones, to the level of the new bridge, where it remained still for an instant, swaying slightly. At that time he could see very clearly its circular form and its red luminosity—more intense at the center, fading out at the edges—and the glowing halo surrounding it. After a few second's pause, it wobbled like the first four, and took off like a flash toward the north, where it was lost in the distance as it gained altitude. During this time the luminosity of the cigar had

faded, and the gigantic object, which may have been 300 feet long, had sunk into darkness. The spectacle had lasted about 3/4 of an hour.

Unbeknown to him, this observer reportedly had witnesses.

Two policemen making their rounds at 11:00 a.m. also observed the phenomenon, as had an army engineer southwest of the town of Vernon.

The case was briefly described in the Paris newspaper, LIBERATION. Nothing more was done about it, except that Michel conducted his own investigation.

Speaking of policemen: if those same two policemen had reported that they had seen two thugs beat up a victim and take to the woods, their testimony might be sufficient to send someone to the chair; but when something violently unusual comes up, like this, or if they had seen the angel Gabriel riding along on a nine-legged octopus, no one would, of course, believe them.

Oddly enough, policemen have figured in many sightings.

I remember back in 1947, a policeman in Oregon who was feeding pigeons in back of the station house, observed some flying disks. It was 11:00 p.m. on the Fourth of July, just two weeks after Kenneth Arnold had reported the first real newspaper case in the U. S., on June 24, 1947—the classic case from whence sprang the name flying saucer. He reported having seen "saucer-like objects" flying over Mt. Rainier.

To get back to France: How does one even begin to explain the first of the remarkable series of French reports? Well, if this case stood alone it would have little significance. Science cannot deal with an individual case. There must be repetition, and pattern.

Three weeks later, September 14, there was a repetition—in broad daylight, and observed by hundreds of witnesses in a half dozen villages in the general area 250 miles S.W. of Paris. Only one newspaper mentioned it, and only by chance did it get investigated. Witnesses were mostly farmers and a few priests and schoolteachers. One witness reported:

"It was about five in the afternoon. Emerging from the thick layer of clouds that looked like a storm coming up, we saw a sort of luminous blue violet mist, of a regular shape something like a cigar or a carrot. Actually the object came out of the layer of clouds in an almost horizontal position, slightly tilted toward the ground and pointing forward, like a submerging submarine.

"This luminous cloud appeared rigid. Whenever it moved, its movements had no connection with the movement of the clouds, and it moved all of a piece, as if it were actually some gigantic machine surrounded by mists. It came down rather fast from the ceiling of clouds to an altitude which we thought was perhaps a half a mile above us. Then it stopped, and the point rose quickly until the object was in a vertical position, where it became motionless.

the lower part where it had first come out. Perhaps a minute
later the carrot leaned over as it began to move, accelerated
and disappeared into the clouds in the distance. The whole
thing lasted about a half an hour."

It would take us too long to quote from the other wit-
nesses—about a hundred in all—but their stories were about
the same.

At this point are you probably saying to yourselves, "Is
this a serious scientist in front of us telling us a tall
tale just to be entertaining? Could it be that he possible
believes this stuff?" Well, certainly, if it is a tall tale,
it is not consciously told as such. It is told, remember, as
far as we are concerned, as a report. We are all somewhat
in the fix, perhaps, of members of an aboriginal tribe
attempting to evaluate the report of a fellow member who had,
in some unaccountable way, an encounter with a helicopter, a
device totally unknown to his fellow tribesmen. A tall tale,
or did he really see something? Our only basis of judgment
would be his past record of credibility, or the records of
all those who reported having seen the helicopter. There
would certainly be no scientific way of judging their story.
The easy way out, of course, would be simply to regard it
as just that—a story. It would absolve his fellow tribesmen
from the necessity of doing any serious thinking about it.

In our own case, and in the cases shortly to be before us, we can vouch only for the fact that the reports do exist, and that whatever stimulus generated them, it generated them for a number of observers rather than a single individual.

Let us go on with a few more French saucers and then sample a few from this country and elsewhere. Let me capsulate a few:

September 7 at Amiens, 7:15 a.m.: "...my eyes were caught by a sort of mound, two hundred yards away in a field. It looked something like an unfinished haystack, with an upside down plate on top.

"That's a queer color for a haystack," I said to Yves, "look at it." All of a sudden I noticed that the haystack was moving a little, with a slight swing back and forth, like an oscillation. We both rushed toward the mysterious object. When we got close the object took off on a slant, traveled diagonally upward for about fifty feet, and then began to go straight up. We watched it for three minutes. The object was about 30 feet in diameter."

September 18: "...an object arrived at high speed over the horizon, stood still several minutes over the town, and then disappeared into the zenith."

September 19: "A circular object appeared suddenly in the north. It was flat gray and appeared to be metallic; it slowed, stopped, and remained motionless for about 30 seconds, during which time it swayed back and forth slightly. After a half minute it went off again in a northwest direction."

Same day, night: "A bright light crossed the sky, slowed down and landed. It seemed to be the size of a small bus. After staying on the ground for about 40 seconds, the light became reddish and rose vertically, and like a red ball, went off toward the southeast."

September 22: Under the clouds a huge, luminous ball hung motionless. Reddish and surrounded by a sort of moving smoke, also luminous. Watched for half an hour. Then suddenly from the lower part of the ball there emerged another, much smaller luminous ball; after a few seconds of free fall it slowed, turned obliquely and disappeared at high speed. A moment later dropped and went off—and then a third, and a fourth. Just then an airplane appeared in another part of the sky; it seemed on a collision course with the ball. The ball abruptly changed position and rose into the clouds and disappeared. The show was over.

September 26: The little dog began to bark and howl miserably. She saw it standing in front of something that looked like a scarecrow. But going closer she saw that the scarecrow was some sort of a small diving suit, made of translucent plastic material. Behind the blurred transparency of the helmet, two large eyes were staring out at her; the suit began moving toward her with a kind of quick, waddling gait.

She uttered a cry of terror and took to the fields.

Looking back she saw a big metallic object, circular and

rather flat, rise up behind nearby trees, move off nearly
level with the wheat field, and then took off toward the
northeast with considerable speed, gaining altitude as it
did so.

Neighbors gathered quickly and at the spot where the
aircraft had risen, they found a circle, ten or so feet in
diameter where the shrubs had been crushed. Trees at the
edge of this imprint had some branches broken and the bark
rubbed off, and the wheat in the direction of take-off was
flattened out in radiating lines.

In this last cited report, the original witness was found
in a state of nervous collapse. She was put to bed where she
remained for two days with a high fever.

Likewise: September 28: A tramp locomotive was running
on a railway line from Nantes to Vannes. In the marsh close
to the tracks a circular, flat machine was in rapid flight
just above the ground. Luminous, dark red, tinged with violet.
It soon reached the locomotive, flying only a few yards above
it, and then followed it. Then it accelerated and disappeared
toward the west at a terrific speed. For a few seconds the
clouds continued to be illuminated by a violet light. The
fireman, bewildered, was trembling so much that his place
had to be taken until they reached the station. He had to
be helped to his bed and for several days he suffered from
nervous shock.

The climax of the French wave came on September 30 and
October 1, 1954, a wave which was over by October 18. But

on those two days, hundreds of reports flooded in. But there was no mechanism whatever to handle them. No scientist would touch this tricky subject, and their official Air Force team began sorting reports by tossing out the "obviously incredible reports." They latched onto those cases in which they could foresee a natural explanation, a most human and understandable reaction.

This French wave of stories is reminiscent of another wave of strange stories that flooded France a century and a half ago—stories of stones that fell from heaven. Persistent stories came in, in waves, from time to time, of stones that fell from the sky. Now, how credulous can one get—stones falling from the sky, indeed!

But in due course the French Academy of Sciences appointed a committee to study the subject, and after a full examination of the stories, reported back to the Academy that there was nothing to it—the stones in question had not fallen from the sky but had been hit by lightning! This despite their much greater density and obvious difference from surrounding stones.

When a group of people don't want to admit something, there's nothing quite as hard headed as a scientific committee, on which each man has his scientific reputation to protect and going out on a limb is certainly not the way to do it.

The great irony of it—and I choose the word irony with care—came just a few years later when the little town of L'Aigle France was literally peppered with iron meteorites.

UFO's 1960

(A written version of the talk presented
to the Hypervelocity Impact Conference
Eglin Air Force Base, April 27, 1960)

I find it intriguing that at such a distinguished
gathering as this I, an astronomer, should be asked to
address you, not on the subject of satellite tracking—
my work for the past four years—nor on stellar spectroscopy, stellar evolution, nor on the expanding universe—
all topics to which I could do some manner of justice—
but on Unidentified Flying Objects. Not that I am not
qualified to speak on this topic. Perhaps, if I may be
permitted to say so without incurring the charge of
immodesty, I am uniquely qualified in all except one
way to speak to you—and that exception is simply that
I have never seen a UFO. But I have had as much experience,
I daresay, as perhaps almost anyone with UFO's on their
own plane of existence. And on that plane they are as real
as rain. That plane is that of reports—for as far as
any of us here are concerned—unless some of you in the
audience have personal experience—they exist for you
and me simply as reports.

This time the French scientist Blot alone undertook the investigation, and in the face of incontrovertible evidence he and his colleagues finally were convinced. Since the year 1803 a meteorite can land in France with the full permission of the French Academy of Sciences.

Lest you think that all the cases I have are French, I will pass on to others, after just one more which bears some resemblance to a case which was reported from Louisiana, which, of course, was originally French territory.

It is October 4 and we are at Poncey. "It was about 8:00 p.m.," Mrs. Fourneret said, "and it had already been dark for some time. About 20 yards from the house, in the meadow, a luminous body was balancing itself lightly in the air, to the right of the plum tree, as if preparing to land. As well as I was able to judge, the object was about three yards in diameter and seemed elongated, horizontal, and orange colored. I was beside myself with fright and seized the boy, running with him to Mme Boullier's house where we closed the door tight."

The neighbors armed themselves, the report continues, and went out to investigate. Nothing was there, but they said they found an area over a yard and a half long, 27-inches wide at one end, 20 at the other, where the ground appeared to have been sucked up. On the fresh soil of this hole they said white worms wriggled, and the earth that had been torn out was

scattered all around the hole in clods ten or twelve inches across over a radius of about four yards. On the inner edge of the hole similar clods hung down; the earth had been pulled out in such a way that about half way down the hole was wider than at ground level.

They reported further that the little roots and rootlets in this fertile soil were intact everywhere on the inner surface of the hole and that not one had been cut, as would have been the case if the excavation had been made in the normal way. At the center of the hole, they said, lay a plant with a long root, still attached by the end of the root to the soil at the bottom of the hole, with all its rootlets exposed to the air, completely undamaged. In short, if we are to accept this report made in concert by a small crowd and investigated by Michel, it looked just as if the mass of earth spread over the surrounding grass had been sucked out by a gigantic vacuum.

The report stated further that while the villagers still crowded around the edge of the hole, a lad arrived on his bicycle, not knowing anything of what had been going on.

"What a fright I just had," he said, "I saw some kind of a luminous object that was going toward the southeast and climbing. It was like an airplane without any wings, nothing but the fuselage. And the faster it went, the greener it was."

Time does not permit me to continue these tales. There were also a number of cases during this interval involving encounters with occupants of the craft that had landed. Descriptions from all over France were remarkably alike. Small men, in diving suit-like costumes—all non-hostile but ready to protect themselves. Frequently it was reported that automobile motors and lights went out when the object was nearby, and promptly came back into normal operation when the object had left.

This brings to mind the famous Hopkinsville case in Kentucky, investigated by a chap who was, quite inadvertently and unbeknown to me at the time of his hiring, employed by me in the satellite tracking project. As time went on I got the full story from him and indeed I could have spent the entire hour tonight telling this tale, a tale so incredible that no sober scientist would care to be caught within ten feet of it. Yet it is one of the reports—and I stress again, reports, because my friend saw nothing himself, but merely interrogated, he having been at that time the announcer at their local radio station.

I have here some drawings that my friend composed from the descriptions given to him, independently, by the highly untutored people who reported they had had this outlandish experience. This brings to mind the report of Father Gill in New Guinea in which he stated that he waved to some creatures in a flying saucer and that they waved back!

By luck I seem to have known a number of people who were directly concerned with UFO cases, though unfortunately (or perhaps I should say fortunately!) I have never had any personal experience with a UFO. There was the dozing passenger in the famous Chiles-Whitted case in Alabama about 10 years ago, and there is the balloonist, Charles Moore, who recently took the observations that established the presence of water on Venus. Speaking of balloonists, I happen also to know personally the man who launched the first Sky Hook balloon, in the days when these things were supersecret, and which particular balloon happened to cause Captain Mantell's death when on that fateful day he blacked out in attempting to identify it.

The Charles Moore case is of some interest in itself because of the high technical qualifications of the observer. He was preparing a site for the launching of a large test balloon at White Sands on April 24, 1949. He was checking on cross-winds in the valley between two mountain ranges and had launched a small weather balloon, watching it in a theodolite, keeping it on the cross-hairs. He had a new chap on the team who wanted experience in tracking balloons; and so Moore turned the theodolite to him, cautioning him to keep it on and not lose it, because Moore didn't want to waste a balloon. Shortly after, Moore looked up to check the balloon by unaided eye and thought he saw it moving off to the east. He yelled at the chap that he had lost the balloon, but the chap said,

Some years ago the Air Force did me the honor of adopting—at least semi-officially—my definition of Flying Saucers. "A Flying Saucer is any aerial sighting or phenomenon that remains unexplained long enough for someone to write a report about it."

My acquaintance with Flying Saucers, as reports, goes back twelve years when, as an astronomer at Ohio State, and hence quite close to Wright Field and the Air Technical Intelligence Center—I was asked to review some 200 reports to see how many could be explained on an astronomical basis. Most unfortunately, the really interesting ones could not be. There were many meteors and fireballs, and occasionally the planets, as in one case where Jupiter and its four bright satellites was reported as a mother space ship and its brood of small craft. But the real lulus, silver disks that sped across the sky, lights that wandered about the sky at night, luminous objects that landed and from which emerged little men, or as in the case of two FBI operatives I interviewed (quite a switch—usually they interview me) who were scared witless (the word is witless) by a large version of a child's Christmas toy top that buzzed them on a lonely road in South Carolina at 4:00 a.m.—none of these reports had, at least in my mind, a ready explanation.

"Nope--it's still on the cross-wires." Moore looked and confirmed this, and then rapidly switched the theodolite to the strange object, catching it after it had "passed through" the sun. It was elliptical, two or three times as long as it was wide, moving along its major axis, and covered the entire sky from the southwest to the northeast in 60 seconds. Five others saw it and confirmed Moore's sighting. Moore checked his refocus of the theodolite and found it had been focused for infinity. In my talks with him, he has completely ruled out the possibility of aircraft, particularly since it covered the sky in 60 seconds. It went down to an elevation of 25 degrees and then just before it disappeared, which it seemed to do quickly, it rose in elevation by 5 degrees, as checked by the theodolite.

This sighting has been classified as a mirage by some "experts" but the physics in this case certainly escapes me.

Moore then launched another balloon and tracked it throughout its course to 90,000 feet. At no level were the winds from the southwest, so a balloon is ruled out.

I like to talk with and size-up reporters of reports. I have talked with Adamski, and find him an out-and-out fraud, despite the fact that Queen Wilhelmina gave him a special audience. He is the gentleman who professes to have regular consort with saucers and their inhabitants, and even to have taken a trip in a saucer. Long years of experience with people who come to the observatory, or write in about their

theories—which I file in my file called novel ideas to avoid the possible libel implications of crackpot—have taught me how a typical fraud or crackpot chooses his words and phrases. Among other things, he cannot conduct a rational discussion, but resorts to constant repetition; he won't listen to the other person and cannot answer questions rationally or intelligently.

I have never, however, attended a saucerian convention. The Sixth Interplanetary Spacecraft Convention was held in Yucca Valley, California, on last May 31 and June 1, with 10,000 in attendance. It was here that one newsman was wandering, bewildered, trying to find someone sane to talk to, and entered into conversation with one young woman who appeared to have sense; and so he discussed with her his interest in Mars, pointing out that he had a small telescope and often observed Mars. The young lady listened intently, making an intelligent comment occasionally, but the budding friendship ended most abruptly when she said, "How interesting—and when did you last visit Mars?"

At another convention, a saucer enthusiast distributed packets of hair clipped from a 385-pound Venusian dog. It's things like this that give saucers a bad name!! Scarce wonder that the whole subject—which undoubtedly has some scientific paydirt in it—is so easily tossed aside by responsible people.

And, oh yes, at another convention one could buy a book

entitled, "My Saturnian Lover," photographs of saucers, the moon seen from an approaching saucer, moon scenery, and could buy a record of Saturnian music; and, if they stayed up late enough, the conventioneers would see mysterious blue lights at play and observe a balloon-shaped saucer that rose opportunely from behind the barn.

We have gone from the sincerely attested reports, made by people highly respected in their communities, to sheer charlatanism--but one must take care to step carefully to distinguish the daisies from the cow dung.

I have three more items to place before you, the jury.

"Last Monday night, about 10:30," Hamilton said, " we were awakened by a noise among the cattle. I arose, thinking that perhaps my bulldog was performing some of his pranks, but upon going to the door saw to my utter astonishment an airship slowly descending over my cow lot, about 40 rods from the house. Calling my tenant, Old Haslip, and my son Wall, we seized some axes and ran to the corral. Meanwhile, the ship had been gently descending until it was not more than 30 feet above the ground, and we came within 50 yards of it. It consisted of a great cigar-shaped portion, possibly 300 feet long, with a carriage underneath. The carriage was made of glass or some other transparent substance alternating with a narrow strip of some material. It was brilliantly lighted within and everything was plainly visible--it was occupied by six of the strangest beings I ever saw. They were jabbering together, but we could not understand a word

This sighting was but one of a great many that took place during the great airship episode of 1897--the ship that was sighted and its progress watched all the way from San Francisco to Virginia. A look at the newspaper files of that day will recount the events.

Let us come to more recent times: Again--let me remind you that as before we are dealing at the level of reports. These are nothing but reports I bring before you--and on their level of existence, they are real--that is--real reports.

November 2, 1957, Levelland, Texas: At 10:50 the police station received a call from a local farmhand and part-time barber, Pedro Saucedo (a symbolic name), and his companion Joe Salaz. The story: We first saw a flash of light in the field to our right, and we didn't think much about it--then it rose up out of the field and started toward us, picking up speed. When it got nearer, the lights of my truck went out and the motor died. I jumped out and hit the deck as the thing passed directly over the truck with a great sound and a rush of wind. It sounded like thunder, and my truck rocked from the blast. I felt a lot of heat. Then I got up and watched it go out of sight toward Levelland.

Saucedo said the object was torpedo shaped--like a rocket--and estimated it as 200 feet long. Afraid to return to Levelland for fear of encountering it again, the two men drove on to Whiteface, ten miles west of Levelland, where they phoned in their report. Although Saucedo sounded terrified, the

officer on duty did not at that time take the report
seriously.

But an hour later the police got another telephone report.
Jim Wheeler, about four miles east of Levelland, had seen a
blazing 200-foot egg-shaped object sitting on the road ahead
of him. At the same time, his car lights went out and his
motor died. The object rose and disappeared. A few minutes
later came a call from Witharral, ten miles north-northeast
of Levelland; Jose Alvarez reported that his lights and motor
had gone dead as he drove near a bright, egg-shaped object on
the road. At 12:15 a.m. Frank Williams of Kermit, Texas,
reported a similar encounter in the same area. While the
officials were out investigating--and, incidentally, reporting
strange lights themselves--the police station received a call
from James Long, who reported that at 1:15 a.m. he had been
driving on a farm road five miles N.W. of Levelland when he
came upon a 200-foot-long, egg-shaped mass that glowed like
a neon sign. His engine coughed and died, and his lights
went out. As he got out and approached the object, which
was less than a hundred yards away, it suddenly took off
straight upwards. After the object was gone, his engine
started easily.

These engine stoppings, we remember, also occured in the
French incidents. The next day two more witnesses reported
to the police that they had encountered a UFO. Texas Freshman
was approaching Levelland at 12:05 a.m. when he noticed his
ammeter jump to discharge and back--then his motor quit as if

it were out of gas--and the lights went out. He got out and
looked under the hood but could find nothing wrong. Turning
around he saw on the road ahead an egg-shaped object with a
flattened bottom--like a loaf of bread and glowing not as
bright as neon. No portholes or propellers were visible.
Frightened, Wright got back into his car and tried to start
it, but without success. After a few minutes, the egg rose
almost straight up, veered slightly to the north and dis-
appeared from view in a "split instant." After it was gone,
the car started normally.

And now, let us come up almost to the present. This
month (April at LaCamp, Louisiana, there was a sighting
which bears some relation to those in France. There was,
unfortunately, only one visual witness but several auditory
witnesses. The object or objects--but witness says one object--came
silently out of the north, and the attention of the witness
was first attracted by loud explosions and a bright firey
red light at ground level about two or three hundred yards
away. Witness stated that the object and light combined had
the size of a nickel held at arm's length and that it appeared
to circle, bounce, then turned and went off into space after it
had made a number of momentary contacts with the earth. The
entire phenomenon lasted only two or three seconds, but when
daylight was available again pictures were taken of the
impact points. On five of these, paint or metallic sub-
stance had scraped off but no other physical evidence

was found. The area was searched by helicopter and on foot
for a quarter of a mile radius, but no hardware was found.
Five craterlets were formed, each about 10 inches deep,
18 inches wide, and 30 inches long, which were fresh.

although the territory of impact was unimproved, the evidence
seems clear that the marks were actually made at the time of
the explosion. Close to one of the impact marks the bark had
been scraped off a tree, one branch had been broken, presumably
by the object, and leaves were torn off the top portion of the
tree.

The investigating completed so far indicates that there
was no aircraft whatever in the area and further that there
had been no sounds previous to the time of contact. No aircraft

Phenomena been noted on the night of the sighting.
Evaluation of this report must await further investigation;
but it does appear that for a space of some 120 yards some
object traveled nearly horizontally, made contact with the
earth, produced a considerable luminous phenomenon, and
then disappeared to the extent that no tangible evidence
of it other than that already mentioned was found in the
area. No radiation readings were obtained because of lack
of equipment.

One would like to wipe this case off the books, so to
speak, by proving definitely that it was a misfired rocket
from some aircraft. This is about the only logical, normal
explanation, since it was traveling far beyond terminal
velocity for a freely falling body, and its path was far
more horizontal than vertical. The lack of tangible hard-
ware is likewise hard to explain on this hypothesis.

Furthermore, as there was no indication of any land-based
or air-based rocket firing not only on that night but on
any night of that season.

One might like to explain this as a meteorite, but almost
certainly a meteorite would have been/visible long before its
actual landing and would have fallen much more vertically
than horizontally. Indeed, after terminal velocity takes
hold of a meteorite, it simply falls to the ground as though
it had been released from some high point in the vicinity of
the landing place.

If we wish to be fanciful, or perhaps we should not say
fanciful but fanciful way in the sense not that it doesn't
fit all the facts, but because our minds are completely
unused to such concepts, we might say that just as we plan

Now mind you. I'm not saying that these things happened. I'm saying that they were reported to have happened—a very, very great difference. And the central problem to which I address myself tonight, and on which I want you to be the judge and jury, is simply—what on earth (or perhaps I should say, what not on earth) could be the stimuli that gave rise to these reports.

This is the problem which concerns me—largely as a matter of curiosity—because in our times there has been no more bizarre phenomenon, that attracted the attention of so many, than that of the waves of flying saucer reports that have from time to time occurred in the U. S., in France, in Brazil, Italy and lately, I hear also, in the USSR. It chills me to think that our Russian colleagues, if they address themselves to this problem, might come up with an answer before we do—that is, an answer to the problem of report generation.

In what field of human endeavor might the answer lie?

In physics, in psychology, in meteorology, in optics, in ESP, or finally in astronomy, or in the province of astronomy? It must lie somewhere—perhaps in many of these fields. (I mean the answer to where the stimuli for the reports lie.)

The reports are real, and their cause must be real—even if the cause is mass hallucination, it is still a real cause.

In some years hence to spend send a probe to some other planet
to take a sample of the surface and return, so this might
have been an interplanetary probe from elsewhere, which
picked up its sample and went off! There is nothing in the
facts that would contradict it, but I am sure that none of
us here would accept that explanation without a great deal
more corroborative evidence.

Herein the scientific investigator must differ from the
UFO enthusiast who jumps to conclusions/largely because he
wishes a thing to be so, he automatically adopts it as being
so.

We still must address ourselves to the task of evaluating
whatever the stimuli that gave rise to the typical examples
I have outlined to you. I should say, the typical "unknown,"
since of course the most frequent stimuli for UFO reports
are indeed perfectly familiar objects or phenomena that have
been misidentified by the person making the report. We must
remind ourselves again that a UFO is nothing more than any
aerial sighting or phenomenon that remains unexplained long
enough for someone to write a report about it. We have been
dealing with the reports that continue to remain unexplained.

What can we say of such reports in general? De-they-fail
in-the-province-of science? Does the problem of the stimuli that
generated such reports fall in the province of science? We
must remind ourselves that science can progress only when
phenomena exhibit repeatability, exhibit a
pattern, and, particularly, when numbers can be assigned to

Here is the text from the document:

phenomena in the sense, for instance, of precise angular velocities precise spectroscopic analysis of the light, detailed photographic evidence, and all of the many things that we have learned to associate with the progress of science. Science cannot logically be concerned with, for instance, religious miracle or indeed with any phenomena which are heterogeneous or singular. Let us suppose, for instance, that once every 100 years the earth were indeed visited, without fanfare, by interplanetary or interstellar beings. Unless all the paraphernalia of science were around at the time of the rare visit, that is, motion picture cameras, flood lights, spectroscopes, geiger counters, tape recorders, and at least 100 scientists who could cross-check on each other, the incident would be sure to be passed off as a figment of the imagination, an hallucination—mass hallucination if you wish—a hoax, or what have you. My point is that the visitation would have to be documented as no other human experience in order to be accepted.

And this quite rightly so. If such visitations occurred much more frequently, say once a week in various parts of the earth, but occurred at random and without the presence of scientists and their apparatus, a thing like that could go on for dozens of years before a sufficient body of evidence and a sufficient pattern of behavior could be accumulated to be introduced into the court of science. We need remind ourselves only of the case of the meteorites to see that this is so. And the more "noise" in the background, the longer it would take to sift out a meaningful pattern. In the case of

- page 36 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

the whole we certainly do have our 'signal' almost entirely
submerged in 'noise'. It is well known to all how tricky it
is to get a meaningful residue out of recorded 'hash'. The
case of the radar reflections of Venus is the case in point:

a formidable series of autocorrelation checks run on electronic
computers was necessary to mathematically the fact that in the
total noise signal from Venus there was indeed very deep within
it the faint radar echo.

We are faced with a similar problem, except that of course
radar is an accepted phenomenon, Venus is known to be there,
and the people in charge of the project were all highly
reputable scientists of enviable past records. None of these
conditions obtained-ly prevail in the matter of the UFO.

We have not the slightest notion that "Venus" is there in
our case, and it seems highly unpreferable to expend that
amounts of energy and the time of scientists and engineers
who might more profitably employed otherwise, in attempting
to find an answer to the question "What was the stimuli
that gave rise to these reports?"

And yet when this "noisy signal" has been coming at
us for the past dozen years at least and occasionally there
seems to be a "blip" which rises well above the noise level,
as in the case of some of the French sightings, one does
indeed wonder whether the time has come to pay some attention
to it. The role of the Air Force in the problem of the UFO
in the past dozen years has been in line with its avowed
mission, namely that of determining the potential hostility
of any action in the air that cannot be immediately explained.

Their verdict to date has been that whatever the stimuli for

- page 37 -

Here is the text from the document:

the unknown sightings may be, there is no indication of hostility. And since the great preponderance of the reports are easily explainable as misidentifications of common objects, it seems almost justifiable to extrapolate a bit and cover the remaining two or three per cent and say that if sufficient data had been available, those cases too, would have fallen into the category of basic misidentification.

This seems a mighty safe thing to do, and might turn out to be correct; but from my own personal standpoint, as one who has had a fair amount of experience in these things, I will not be satisfied until sufficient investigation shows that this is indeed the proper explanation. I think you will agree that many of the reports would be most difficult to explain as misidentification. Yet to continue such research places one on what General Cramer, General Air Defense Co-ordinator, Allied Air Forces, Central Europe, NATO, has called "the difficult path of research that is temporarily in disrepute." He has further stated that "true, the reported sightings include observations of meteorites and balloons, and even lies and dreams; that is why rigorous and examination of reports is essential. But after all the examination and screening is finished, we still have a percentage of observations that stubbornly resist every conventional explanation we can, therefore, categorically say that serious objects have indeed appeared and continue to appear in the sky that surrounds us."

His conclusion would be correct if he were dealing with phenomena that occur in any other field of [illegible word]

human experience in law, in medicine or in the many branches
of the sciences. Evidence so well attested would certainly
be accepted in court. But it is understandable why it cannot
be as yet in the area in which we are dealing. We do need
either a breakthrough here—and a breakthrough would consist
of one or more sightings that occurred in front of a battery
of scientists and their instruments, and which sighting also
produced copious amounts of hardware—or we need a very care-
ful and devoted study to the evidence already at hand, even
reporting that the signal-to-noise ratio is extremely low
and indeed, less than unity. At least, it appears to be
that work should be done on testing some of the hypotheses
that have been put forward in cases in which numerous wit-
nesses were present and phenomenon lasted a reasonable length
of time. It is, of course, as very easy to say "mass hallucina-
tion." Under what circumstances does mass hallucination occur?
In what sort of people does it occur? Do we have well attested
well attested cases of mass hallucination in which a dozen
people, often independently, and often scattered over considerable
geographic areas, have been stimulated to make the same sort
of report? Or we certainly do know that we have strange that
an precise spectacular affects, particularly close to the
horizon. But can a mirage travel from one end of the sky to
the other and play about for an hour or so? Tremendously
careful meteorological conditions would have to be predicated.
We must at least ask whether such meteorological conditions
existed at the times of such reports before we say that a mirage
that looked like an unusual craft cavorted about the sky for a
long period of time and was seen over several hundred square

More often stated in the past that the UFO problem, however it may be, is nevertheless a problem in public relations and that it presents to us an unparalleled example opportunity to give science a boost in the popular mind by providing the opportunity for the demonstration of the application of the scientific method in action. A puzzling sighting occurs, what better service could we do to the public or to science by showing how the scientists in detective fashion, go about gathering their clues and drawing their inescapable conclusions. I would like to point out that it is not in the spirit of science for an investigator either to do a sloppy job or to, a priori, jump to a conclusion. He may be dead right, but in science conclusions are not arrived at by fast jumping; they are arrived at by a careful step-by-step analysis.

I would like to recommend, in concluding, that since the UFO problem has been with us for the past dozen years and is likely to remain for some time, (certain selected reports and at the risk of great repetition, let us remind ourselves that we are still talking solely about reports) be carefully physically examined by a panel consisting not only of qualified scientists, but of a psychologist, a psychiatrist, a lawyer, and perhaps a prosecuting attorney, plus educational, public relations people, and a man of the cloth. Such a panel, operating without stigma or implied ridicule, could address itself to the task of the problem of report generation—not in a study of flying saucers. It appears to me that this would put things in dis-

*It appears to me that this would put things in a different light. I do not believe that anyone can doubt the importance to the armed services of an understanding of how reports "wild reports" get generated. For example, someday a report may get generated which will cause an ICBM to go flying across the ocean prematurely. Likewise, space surveillance on the part of the armed services is a rapidly growing concept.

Certainly such surveillance crews must be informed on how reports of strange objects get generated, and, too, they must be aware of all types of natural phenomena—astronomical, meteorological, biological—that in themselves can give rise to such reports. I emphasize again that such a panel would not concern itself with the UFO problem in general, but only with a few selected instances, and then entirely from the standpoint of a serious and calm study of the manner in which the report was generated. Such a study might well yield valuable data not only in psychology and public relations, but in adding to our knowledge of atmospheric optics, unusual meteorological occurrences, and the many facets of physics.

What generated these reports? Here are a few things.
(At this point in the talk slides of fireballs, illuminated
cirrus clouds, balloons, artificial earth satellites were
shown along with a number of cartoons from the popular press.)

What generated the others? What others?

Let us now grant that the great majority of reports are
generated because people are simply not good observers,
because they are easily mistaken in what they see, because
they do not understand mirages, meteors, and strange
meteorological phenomena. And also let us grant that
some are generated because many people are downright
superstitious, and what is more, because a great many people
are wishful thinkers and, if the truth be known, lonesome.
It might surprise us to realize how many people desperately
want there to be other life in the universe and to be able
to communicate with it. And hence these people will swallow
any cock and bull story that by the remotest chance might
be credible.

The universe of the astronomer today is a vast and
frightening place. It was one thing when man had reason
to believe that he was the king-pin in the universe and
that he and the earth were the center of creation. But
today, in his most uncertain world, fraught with ICBM's
and the threat of annihilation, there are many of us who
would like to think that we are not alone, that we can be

friends with someone in the cold outside universe, and
that perhaps through them make rapid strides in our science
and even in our politics. There are some who believe
that if we could turn our attention to something absorbing
away from the earth perhaps our fears of nuclear warfare
among ourselves would diminish, and perhaps that this
new focus of attention might even lead to the solution
of all of our hard problems as inhabitants of this tiny
earth. For it is tiny. May I digress for a moment and
speak as an astronomer rather than as a UFO investigator,
to summarize for you the astronomical situation, for it
is a very necessary backdrop to our story.

The world's largest telescope is the 200-inch Hale
telescope on Mt. Palomar; it can see out into space several
billion light years. The light year in itself is hard to
visualize, but perhaps it can be attempted if one imagines
a string going around the earth's equator 236 million times.
The length of that string would be one light year. It is
important to remember that the nearest star to the sun is
four and one half light years away.

The distances are so vast that it is only natural
that we try to condense them and make a model of things
to aid our own thinking. Suppose we were to try to make
a model, to scale, of everything that is visible through
the world's largest telescopes. Let us give our imagination

full play and assume that we could use the entire area
of the United States on which to construct our model--
a sort of supercosmic Disneyland. If we did this we
should discover to our amazement that even in such a
stupendous model the earth would be completely invisible,
even through a microscope. Yes, indeed, even through an
electron microscope. Faced with such a universe in which
to live, it is no wonder that man as a sub submicroscopic
speck feels isolated and alone, and afraid of the Russians,
and perhaps it is understandable that he might be desirous
of seeking out and finding some understanding intelligence
elsewhere. Indeed, there are few scientists, and particu-
larly astronomers, who would not welcome bonafide evidence
that intelligent beings did exist elsewhere and that there was
a possibility of communication with them. (Think of the
increased appropriations for scientists--and for UFO inves-
tigators!) Only our military friends, justly cautious,
warn us, if this be the case, not to try to communicate
first, lest our "friends" in space prove hostile and
annihilate or at least exploit us. Perhaps we should be
content to be alone in space!

(At this point in the talk a number of representative
slides were shown depicting objects in the solar system, in
our galaxy, The Milky Way, and clusters of galaxies out to
the limit of the visible universe.)

Now we are through with our cosmic digression. I leave it for you to figure out for yourself how grossly probable it is that other life exists in the universe—somewhere in the countless other solar systems that, it would seem, statistically must exist—yet how improbable it is for such life to travel to us, and to communicate with us, unless it originates somewhere in our own solar system, or at very best, around some of the very nearest stars to us. There is, of course, always the outside possibility that other beings have invented means of extremely rapid transport, allowing them to travel with nearly the velocity of light. In this case, relativity points out that their time scale would be so short relative to ours, that to them it would appear as though they made a journey of many light years in just a few years. Although theoretically possible, this is yet too much in the realm of science fiction for us to consider seriously.

And now, with this stage setting, let us examine the report—and again I emphasize that we shall be examining just reports, reports whose generating stimuli many of us would most dearly like to discover, for there may indeed be some very good physics hidden in them. Something caused these reports to be made. What was it? Were the causes related, or did one set of things generate one set of reports, say in France, and another in Brazil? Do Italian flying saucers bear the same stamp as those of the U. S. or of France? Let us examine the evidence.

I would now like to describe for you some French flying saucers. It appears that for about two months in France, from the middle of August to the middle of October, 1954, France was peppered with a barrage of UFO reports. Like mushrooms they spouted all over France and likewise some in Italy and some in Germany. The reports of these, however, came in largely through the medium of French provincial newspapers. And it was only through the work of Aime Michel, an enthusiastic investigator in France, that these reports were collated, plotted, and compared. The compilation of these reports appears in a book by Michel, "Flying Saucers and the Straight-Line Mystery." The "Straight-Line Mystery" in the title refers to the fact that when Michel plotted the reports for any one day on a very large-scale map, the reports had a devastating way of forming straight-line patterns on the map, most difficult to explain by chance.

I would not, of course, accept anything I read in a book without knowing something of the author. It chanced that I happened to be in Paris on other business and took two days off on my own to seek out Michel and talk with him. He lives with his wife and small son in a small modest Paris suburb apartment. He is a radio engineer and, what I was particularly anxious to find out of calm, rational deportment, quite unlike the typical enthusiast or crackpot with whom it has been my lot to come in contact from time to time. I went over with Michel many of his
