10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    Appeared elliptical (football type), size of
    disc, time-white changed to red. More trail at
    either side than to rear. Trail began at nose
    and fanned out rapidly until it was 2 times as
    large as object at the tail. Very slight trail
    behind object, about 1/4 length of object.
    Appeared approx 20° declination and azimuth
    300°. No rearward sidereal from g/c at altitude of 8000 ft, heading (magnetic) 291°.

11. COMMENTS
    Object moving in wrong direction for a
    meteor. Somewhat erratic motion and description similar to meteor. The earth is passing through a number of meteor showers
    this time of year, and the object sighted
    was probably from one of these showers.
