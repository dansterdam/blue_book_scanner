Dear Sir:

Evaluation of the negative which you submitted to us for analysis on 7 DECEMBER 1964 has been completed.

Photo analysis reveals that the superimposed image was probably caused by a scratch or pin hole in the negative. The scratches or pinholes are probably caused by normal handling, such as plate loading or older removals may have been used on the film clip holder.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.

The image contains a photography analysis report related to an "Unidentified Flying Object" observed in South Charleston, Ohio on October 31, 1964. The report includes a description of the photographic evidence, which consists of one negative and three prints provided by the United States Air Force. The report provides an analysis of the photographic evidence and its potential causes, including a reflection from a housed light and a sharpness likely caused by a light bulb reflection. The report is approved by WILLIAM L. TURNER, Captain, USAF, Chief, Photo Analysis Division.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR: 64-66
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: South Charleston, Ohio
DATE: 31 October 1964
PHOTOGRAPHY: 
PHOTO NRS: One negative and three prints provided by USAF
PURPOSE: This report answers work request #64-109 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., Chief of Investigations Division, regarding an analysis of the photographic data submitted on the 'Unidentified Flying Object' observed in the South Charleston, Ohio area on 31 October 1964 by Processing personnel.
RESULTS: A careful analysis and review of the provided subject negative and prints with the following results:
a. A series of exposures prior to the film plate loading or after removing the film from a clip holder were caused by a light entry into the camera during the film loading or unloading process, which produced an area of overexposure.
b. This superimposed image was probably caused by a reflection from a housed light source.
c. The sharpest image on the negative and prints is probably caused by a light bulb reflection and a screen over the reflector, such as is commonly used for ceiling lighting.

Producing the text output from the document:

Dear Sir:
Enclosed is the negative to be checked out. The data on negative is as follows:
The picture was taken on Oct. 31st. at 5:30 P.M.
It was taken with a 2¼ x 3¼ Century Graphic on tripod at 
f 22 with an exposure time of three seconds. The film used was
ILFORD FP-3, a fine grain panchromatic film.
Three other shots were made of the same scene at same
location with slight change in the exposure time.
The other three negatives are closer of foreign objects.
Major, during our phone conversation I forgot to mention 
the fact that the strange objects on the film was not visible
to my eyes or no sound were heard at time of exposure.
Also, sir, I do not want this to be released to the news as
yet is in the process of being copyrighted.
I do hope that it will help you in some way in your work.
If this can be solved it will certainly be a relief to my mind.

P.S. The camera lens was also equipped with a K3 yellow filter.

Sincerely

South Charleston, Ohio.

The image does not contain a photograph. It is a typed letter from a "FREE LANCE PHOTOGRAPHER" located in South Charleston, Ohio. The letter discusses a conversation the photographer had with a Sergeant regarding some photography-related issue. The letter mentions that the Sergeant believes the photographer's work to be "trick photography" and requests that the photographer keep the negative until the investigation is completed. The letter does not mention or show any photographs.

Here is the full text transcribed from the document:

"FREE LANCE PHOTOGRAPHER
South Charleston, Ohio
Dec. 22, 1964

Dear Sir:

Wednesday afternoon I called your office to check with you concerning a negative containing U.F.O.s which I sent to you a few weeks ago.
A Sergeant took the call. The conversation with him gave me the opinion that it was some kind of 'trick photography'. Major, I wish this was true, there is actual reality in this incident. The Sergeant knows very little about photography. I am too busy with my work to play around with a negative just to 'trick' someone. Seriously I don't believe any photographer could do that. It would be impossible to do. 

I thought, maybe it could have been done in England where the film was made, but after checking the print again I noticed the one object going through the air seemed to vanished off on both sides allowing it to slide through. This, to me cleared the company.

Another factor that I was concerned about was at the bottom part of the negative, which has a margin. Exposure may be caused if the object recorded this the object had to penetrate the wood part of the film holder which made the margin.

You keep the negative until your investigation is completed. But keep one thing in mind that this is not 'trick photography' on my part. All I wish is you will be able to clear this thing up. If it cannot be explained please tell me so. I will then release it to news agencies.

Sincerely,"

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing a UFO sighting in South Charleston, Ohio on October 31, 1964.

SOUTH CHARLESTON, OHIO
31 OCTOBER 1964

A free lance photographer took a picture on 31 October 1964 at 5:30 pm EST. Three other shots were made of the same scene at the same location with slight changes in the exposure time. According to the photographer, the other three negatives are clear of foreign objects.

The strange objects that appear on the film were not visible to the photographer, nor were any sounds heard at time of exposure. Photo analysis personnel feel that the images were caused by a series of exposures prior to the film plate loading or after removing the film from the film clip holder.

This super-imposed image was probably caused by a reflection from a housed light source.

The sharpest image on the negative and prints is probably caused by a light with reflector and a screen over the reflector, such as is commonly used for ceiling lighting.
