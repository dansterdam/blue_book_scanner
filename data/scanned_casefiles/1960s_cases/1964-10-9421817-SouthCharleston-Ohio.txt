Dear Sir:

Evaluation of the negative which you submitted to us for analysis
on 7 Nov 64 has been completed.

Photo analysis reveals that the superimposed image was probably
caused by a reflection from a house light source. The sharpest
image on the negative and prints is probably caused by a light
bulb reflector and a screen over the reflector, used as is commonly
used for ceiling lighting. We feel the images were caused by a
series of exposures prior to the film plate loading or after removing the film from the film clip holder.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is the negative to be checked out. The data on negative is as follows:

The picture was taken on Oct. 31st at 5:30 P.M.
It was taken with a 2½ x 3¼ Century Graphic on tripod at F 32 with an exposure time of three seconds. The film used was Ilford FP3- a fine grain panchromatic film.

Three other shots were made of the same scene at same location with slight change in the exposure time.
The other three negatives are clear of foreign objects.

Major, during our phone conversation I forgot to mention the fact that the strange objects on the film was not visible to my eyes or no sounds were heard at time of exposure.

Also, Sir, I do not want this to be released to the news as yet is in the process of being copyrighted.

I do hope that it will help you in some way in your work.
If this can be solved it will certainly be a relief to my mind.

P.S. The camera lens was also equipped with a K 3 yellow filter.

Sincerely

                                    South Charleston, Ohio.

Dear Sir:

Wednesday afternoon I called your office to check with you concerning a negative containing U.F.O. which I sent to you a few weeks ago.

A Sergeant took the call. The conversation with him gave me the opinion that it was some kind of trick photography. Major, I wish this was true.

Then it could easily be cleared up. Evidently the Sergeant knows very little about photography. I am too busy with my work to play around with a negative just to trick someone. Seriously I don't believe any photographer could fix that small of a negative by trick. I think it would be impossible to do so.

I thought maybe it could have been done in England where the film was made but after checking the print again I noticed the one object going through the wire seemed to sheared off on both sides allowing it to slide through.

This, to me cleared the company.

Another factor that I was concerned about was at the bottom part of the negative, which has a margin. Exposure may be seen which means if the camera recorded this the object had to penetrate the wood part of the film holder which made the margin.

You may keep the negative until your investigation is completed. But keep one thing in mind that this is not trick photography on my part. All I wish is you will be able to clear this thing up. If it cannot be explained please tell me so.

I will then release it to news agencies.

Sincerely,
[signature redacted]

SOUTH CHARLESTON, OHIO
31 OCTOBER 1964

A free lance photographer took a picture on 31 October 1964
at 5:30 pm EST. Three other shots were made of the same scene
at the same location with slight change in the exposure time.
According to the photographer, the other three negatives are clear
of foreign objects.

The strange objects that appear on the film were not visible
to the photographer, nor were any sounds heard at time of exposure.
Photo analysis personnel feel that the images were caused by
a series of exposures prior to the film plate loading or after
removing the film from the film clip holder.

This superimposed image was probably caused by a reflection
from a housed light source.

The sharpest image on the negative and prints is probably caused
by a light bulb reflector and a screen over the reflector, such as
is commonly used for ceiling lighting.
