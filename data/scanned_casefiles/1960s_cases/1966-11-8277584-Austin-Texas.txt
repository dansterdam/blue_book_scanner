From 70 to 90 degrees above the horizon the object looked like a spinning disc, spinning clockwise until it seemed to explode and no longer visible. The object moved steadily on a northwest heading. At the first sighting the light intensity was described as "bright". The investigating official stated that the object seemed to travel very rapidly but left no trails. The conclusion is that the sighting appears ft possible.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
TAPED - 20 FEBRUARY 1964, SPECIAL AGENT JAMES M. JONES, 7503 STU-MV, PRECEDED AFTER A DEBRIEF1 NG OF THE FIVE OBSERVERS, IS THAT THEY WERE LOOKING ON OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE SHARPLY RISING FROM THE GROUND AND THEY SAY A FLYING SAUCER. THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE OBSERVING AN AIRCRAFT UNTIL THEY WERE UNABLE TO RECONCILE WHAT THEY SAW WITH NORMAL BEHAVIOR OF AIRCRAFT. NO OTHER REPORTS WERE RECEIVED ABOUT THIS INCIDENT. I BELIEVE THAT THE OBSERVERS SAY AIRCRAFT APPROACH THE AUSTIN, TEXAS AND DEPART TO THE NORTHWEST.

AGENT'S REMARK:
THE UNUSUAL APPEARANCE TO THE OBSERVER6 IS DUE TO THE LIGHTS OF NEWTON AUSTIN AND VIEWING OF THE AIRCRAFT FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE.
