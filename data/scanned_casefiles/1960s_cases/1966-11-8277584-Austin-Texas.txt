11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted what appeared to be a ball of light from 20 to 70 degrees above the horizon. From 70 to 90 degrees in the sky the observers looked like a spinning disk. The observers thought the object was an aircraft in trouble and no debris fell. The object moved steadily on a northwest heading. At one time the object appeared to hover, increase in light intensity, then move on toward the NW.

Investigating officials stated that the witnesses thought they were observing an aircraft until they were unable to reconcile what they were seeing. The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. It appears the witnesses saw an aircraft.

TRAINING. w/ PREPARING OFFICER: JAMES L. BOONE,
CAPT, USAF, OPERATIONS STAFF OFFICER, 75 T.R., NY

I PRESSED AFTER INTERVIEWING FOUR OF THE FIVE OBSERVERS
IS THAT THEY WERE REPORTING AN OBJECT THAT APPEARED
OUT OF THE ORDINARY TO THEM. AT NO TIME DID THEY SAY
IT WAS A FLYING SAUCER. THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE OB-
SERVING AN AIRCRAFT UNTIL THEY WERE UNABLE TO RECONCILE
THAT THEY WERE OBSERVING TO THE NORMAL BEHAVIOR OF
AN AIRCRAFT. NO OTHER REPORTS WERE RECEIVED ABOUT THIS
OBJECT. I BELIEVE THAT THE OBSERVERS SAW AN AIRCRAFT
APPROACH THE AUSTIN VOR AND REPORT TO THE NORTHWEST.

PAGE 5 RUNS ON 24 HOURS

THE UNUSUAL APPEARANCE TO THE OBSERVERS WAS DUE TO THE
LIGHTS OF DOWNTOWN AUSTIN AND VIEWING OF THE AIRCRAFT
LIGHTS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES.
