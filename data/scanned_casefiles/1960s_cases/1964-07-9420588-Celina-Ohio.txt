To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter because I feel that it is possible that someone else seen the same thing I seen, and it may help to confirm other reports.

I live on Rt. 197, 2 miles NE of Celina, Ohio on Wed. evening July 29, about 11:15 PM. I was sitting on my front porch relating. Now I have a habit of looking at the stars quite often, but this particular night one of them stood out from the rest. It was very bright and seemed to move ever so little. It appeared about halfway up the horizon in the South West.

At this time my attention was alerted to an airplane that was traveling towards Lima, Ohio or N.E. After the plane was

out of sight, this object started moving toward the North and a little West. It moved at a steady pace making no sound at all. When it traveled past the milky way, it got very dim as though it went through it, or over it then it came to a complete stop for about 10 seconds and then disappeared very rapidly.

I have no idea if this letter will be of any importance to you or not but by writing it I may be able to satisfy my own curiosity.

Sincerely,

[Signature is blacked out]
