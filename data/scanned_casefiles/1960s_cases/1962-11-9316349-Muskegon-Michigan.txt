ASTRONOMY

Jupiter, Saturn Still Visible

Venus, during the present evening sky, is the brightest object in the southeast a little before midnight. Jupiter, except for the moon, is the brightest object in the northern evening sky. James Stokley reports:

ALTHOUGH the planet Venus during the evening hours at present is the brightest object in the south, almost midway to the zenith, Jupiter, the giant of the planets, is still visible in the northwest, about 25 degrees above the horizon, and will be visible in the evening for several more weeks.

Saturn, in the constellation of Capricornus, is also up until about 10:30 P.M. It is of less brilliance than Venus or Jupiter, but still easily seen. About midway through November it will disappear from the evening sky, finally reappearing in the eastern morning sky.

Mars comes up in the east about 11:00 P.M., on the 17th, and later each night. By the end of November it will be up about 9:00 P.M. This is because the planet is rapidly approaching the earth and shining brighter—now 1.0 in magnitude as against 0.7 in October.

Jupiter, in the west, is now the brightest planet in the evening sky, next to the moon. When the month ends, it will be setting about 9:00 P.M. (The closest approach for this apparition occurred on November 11 when Jupiter was 368 million miles from the earth.)

And so, the two brightest planets, Venus in the east and Jupiter in the west, continue to grace the evening sky, with Saturn also visible until the last of November. The planets then will shift to the morning sky.

The image contains a map showing the location of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). There is no photograph present in this page of the document.

FIG. 1 MAP SHOWING LOCATION OF ANDROMEDA GALAXY -- M 31
(Continued from p. 274) The Andromeda Galaxy (which has the special name M31) is designated in this map as the "Great Square" near the center. The Andromeda Galaxy is considerably farther stars, and in that direction we can look beyond, and see the millions of other galaxies that can be photographed with large telescopes. This is Messier 31, or M 31, 15,000,000 light-years away, one of the nearest and largest of the extragalactic nebulae. It contains over 100,000,000,000 stars. The Milky Way is similar, but about 2,300,000 years its junior. This is avowed fact - for using the carbon 14 radio-active clock, that is the age determined to be. M 31 is a twin of our galaxy, the Milky Way. Many of the stars that appear to us to flow from the center to the edges are actually the outer portions of this gigantic spiral nebula, a grindstone about a hundred thousand light years in diameter. As we look in the direction of the center, we see condensed areas which have suffered blue-shift, indicating motion toward us, while those areas at the edges appear red-shifted, indicating motion away from us. This causes the effect of the Milky Way toward those sides of the grindstone there

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document describes an incident that occurred on November 5, 1962 in Tucuman, Argentina. The text details the witness's account of seeing a bright light that illuminated the area and then disappeared. The document does not identify any individuals involved in the incident.

No Case (Information Only)  
5 November 1962  
Tucuman, Argentina

One of the most interesting cases of all occurred on the night of November 5, 1962, and is related in a long account in the Tucumán newspaper published in Tucumán, Argentina. The witnesses were two people who stopped their car on the highway for a rest stop because of a UFO which was blocking their way only 100 yards in front of them.

The witnesses saw the ground, which had been completely covered with a bright light, become suddenly dark. Just a few instants later, the light grew dimmer, and it was only after that that they could see the form of the UFO, which was about the size of a small automobile and seemed to be resting on the ground. The light from the object was so bright that it enabled them to see for a considerable distance around, and it seemed to illumine the whole countryside. The object itself appeared to be about 80 feet in diameter and was rounded on top. It gave off a bluish light which appeared to be evenly distributed over the entire surface. On the side facing the witnesses, there appeared to be a series of rectangular windows from which glowed a soft white light. From the bottom of the object came a beam of brilliant white light that swept the ground for a distance of about 150 yards. This beam of light appeared to be directing the object, as it moved up and down and from side to side in a scanning motion. The object remained in this position for several minutes and then, without any warning, the light grew suddenly brighter for an instant and then winked out completely, leaving the witnesses in total darkness. One of the witnesses said that he believed that he had seen a window or opening on the side of the object, and that through this he had caught a glimpse of a shadowy figure moving inside, but this was not certain. The witnesses were in a state of complete shock and astonishment at what they had seen, and neither one of them was able to drink a drink to fortify themselves.

Children Frightened 
By "Sky Ghost"
LUTHER, ALBERTA, CANADA - Two children at the Fleetwood Elementary School at Lithbridge, Alberta, Canada, have reported seeing a strange, lentil-shaped object in the sky December 1. The children, J.R. Bos and W.J. Allan of Calgary, were interviewed by Mike Williams and Miles White of Lethbridge and forwarded the information to headquarters.
The object, about 70 feet in diameter, first appeared in 1959 and was sighted again on November 23, 1962. At 10:50 p.m. on November 23, 1962, the object was seen by the children and at least one adult.
It was seen again on November 24, 1962 at 6:10 p.m. by a mother and her son, and the Williams boy went to the school on Friday, November 25, 1962. The object was seen a second time on that day. 
On Saturday, December 1, the boy said he saw it hovering over the school yard about 50 feet off the ground. It appeared to be of fantastic shape. The object then shot off in the distance. This was the only sighting that day.
While the object was hovering, children were said to have run into the school's bell tower.
On October 31, the object returned at 8 p.m. and stayed until 9 p.m. and was seen by the children and at least one adult.
It was said to have been hovering over the school yard about 50 feet off the ground. It appeared to be of fantastic shape. The object then shot off in the distance. This was the only sighting that day.
While the object was hovering, children were said to have run into the school's bell tower.
On November 23, at 10:50 p.m. the object was seen again by the children and at least one adult.

Miles White and Mike Williams went to a school, during which Miles warned he would be detained. He blurred, didn't make sense and he fell asleep. He complained first of a "stinging in the head."
A story was published in the papers, but the children and the adults involved were reluctant to talk of their experiences, fearing ridicule.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
25 November 1962
NORTHAMPTON, OHIO

MR. & MRS. JOSEPH TOMASILI were in their driveway, having just arrived home. Their attention was drawn to an object in the sky. They described it as being the apparent size of 14 moons. The object was moving toward the eastern horizon and was seen for a period of about one minute. The object was roughly circular in shape and had the general shape of a shield. It had an orange-red color, except for a silvery ring around the outer edge. The center of the object seemed to be emitting a pulsating ray glow, larger than the clear outline of the object. It moved toward the east and disappeared below the horizon. It appeared to be the same object or another with a different appearance as it returned and continued on the path of the first object. As the first object came into view, it seemed larger than the initial sighting and had the general shape of a shield. It had an orange-red color and a silvery outer ring. It emitted a pulsating ray glow, larger than the clear outline of the object. The sighting lasted about one minute. The object moved toward the east and disappeared below the horizon.

Air Force Academy: 
Colorado Springs 
Colorado

Gentlemen: I have just finished watching out for some celestial program on my Colorado TV on which he interviewed a man who seems to be an authority on flying saucers.  This reminded me of an experience I had 4 or 5 years ago in late December about thanks-giving time - around 3 o'clock in the morning - I happened to be up and looked out of my upstairs window at our several bright objects moving silently and swiftly over my neighbors house - the first one was about the size of the moon - the second was smaller. Each succeeding one smaller than the one preceding it. There were 5 of them in a straight line, at intervals of roughly 5 seconds between each. It was most spectacular and to me and my family and friends who witnessed such a scene it was indeed privileged to witness such a scene. I can only wish that we had a newspaper and write the city.

A blue-and-white radar trace taken from the colour photograph and submitted to the REVIEW by David Budman.

A COLOUR PHOTOGRAPH

All witnesses remain silent and warn me that their identity must be kept secret, so I cannot give their names. At about 10.15 a.m. on 9 November 1962, three middle-aged men, who appear to be foreigners, were watching an object which seemed to be hovering over the nearby hills. Its size was estimated to be the same as a Piper Cub aircraft and it had a luminous quality. After hovering for about 15 minutes and one of the men attempting unsuccessfully to photograph it, the object began moving at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. The three men were quite excited and their hands were shaking. One of them told me that it seemed to "wobble" as it accelerated and took off, finally disappearing in about 3 seconds. After the incident one of the men said he saw a red pulsating light, perhaps an exhaust. The other two did not mention this. All three stated that their attention were drawn to the object and that they had not heard any unusual sound associated with it. Although it appeared to be quite close, it made no more noise than a distant jet aircraft would have made. They all felt that whatever it was, it moved at a speed far in excess of anything they had ever seen before.

Other report for that area shows that earlier in the day, Mrs. Flora Murray, a retired school teacher and Kodak who made a colour transparency from a Kodak Instamatic camera, of an object which she had seen over the nearby hills. The object was about the size of a golf ball at arm's length and was described as metallic-looking and flashing. From her windows, which face in the direction of the hills, she observed the object for about 30 seconds before it disappeared. Her transparency was submitted to REVIEW with the report. The names of all three gentlemen and Mrs. Murray, of course, known to me.

THE FIELDS
MEDICINE
Industrial Noise- No Cause for Illness
From the standpoint of hearing conservation, industrial noise does not require any special treatment. There is no evidence that noise produces any problem with health, unless it causes hearing loss. Exposure to continuous high energy noise can produce temporary or permanent hearing impairment depending upon the intensity and frequency of the noise and the duration of exposure. However, the levels of industrial noise are not ordinarily sufficient to produce any general effect upon the body other than that of hearing that can be lost without serious impairment of health.
SPACE RADIATION More
Than Previous Estimate
The AMOUNT of sperm, fat and other tissue in the body of astronauts present a much greater hazard from cosmic radiation than previously estimated, according to a report from the National Symposium on the Effects of Ionizing Radiation on the Reproductive System. Radiobiologists have concentrated their research on the effects of radiation on the testes, but it appears that other tissues and organs are more vulnerable to damage by cosmic radiation than the testes.
Scientists in their report stated that the metabolic activity and lower uptake was found to give a lower susceptibility to radiation damage in the testes of animals than in other organs. The injury to other tissues and organs of the animals was associated with a larger uptake.

A NEW SOURCE of fertilizer will be found in the minerals extracted when sea water is converted to drinking water. The by-product of this desalinization process will contain nitrogen and magnesium (essential for plant growth) and has been found to be more effective as a fertilizer than commercial fertilizers made from other materials. Other uses of this by-product material may be developed.
Dr. Stierley is discussing these new additions to the sea water distillation process in a paper he presented on October 27, 1962.

ELECTRICITY IN ICE
CRYSTALS CAUSES LIGHTNING
LIGHTNING can be blamed on the electrical activity in ice crystals, water drops and hailstones, L. L. Jones, an atmospheric physicist at General Electric Company, found.
In wind tunnel experiments, ice crystals under certain conditions have been observed to build up electrical charges, he states. The electrical activity and the transfer of current between the crystals causes the lightning flash.
The negative charges are concentrated in the lower, warmer regions of the storm clouds. The positive charges are in the upper, colder regions. The transfer of these opposite charges through the cloud causes the lightning. He believes this knowledge may help in understanding the details of lightning formation and possibly lead to methods of lightning control.
