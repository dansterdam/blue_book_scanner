11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted three lights that appeared to be attached to some type of solid object. The lights appear to take on different shades of color as is passing over. The lights were bright white in the distance, and as they got closer they changed to reddish and bluish. It was compared to the lights on a low flying aircraft. It appeared as would an aircraft into the horizon.

The description is consistent with the an aircraft observation.

Gentlemen:

Enclosed are some notes concerning a UFO which we believe we sighted on the evening of Aug 19, 1966 at about 10:10PM. Flying at an angle of 30 degrees south of due west.

The observers were: [redacted]

Condition of atmosphere: Very Clear
                         No breeze

Type of area: General farming with large areas of woods, somewhat sparsely settled (1/2 87 at Greene Cty)

Unusual characteristics: -Lack of any audible engine noises;
                         -Bright change in apparent direction;
                         -Non-blinking lights, bluish white to reddish; (?)

Size: If it was the size of a large jet plane, eg. Boeing 747, I would have estimated the height at 2500 ft flying at a speed of 75 mph. However it was impossible to estimate size or height because of the bright "lights".

Direction or flight characteristics: Similar to airplane except for apparent directional or altitude change.

Except for mentioning this to a few people I have not made mention of this to any scientific or other institution. I could have been maybe nothing else. At this point I had none of the flight characteristics except direction and speed of an airplane flying at night.

After the UFO disappeared into the west we sighted a typical space satellite flying in an eastward direction.

A LARGE JET AIRCRAFT FLEW TO A
NEARLY VERTICAL POSITION AFTER HE SAW IT.

AT HIS POINT
STOPPED THE

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

THE COUNTRYSIDE AT THE LOCATION OF MY FARM IS VERY QUIET. THE STATE WATER TED GOV OWN MOST OF THE LAND FOR RESERVOIR OR WILDLIFE PURPOSES. I LISTENED INTENTLY FOR SOUND - THERE WAS NONE. THE THAT BOYS HAVE OCCURRED IN HEARING - I RECENTLY ASKED THAT - DO YOU SEE ANYTHING (OTHER THEN LIGHT) "NO" SO YOU HEAR ANYTHING "NO" IT WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO BE AUDIBLE.

WHEN I FIRST SPOTTED IT - I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT FIREFLY IN THE TREES. WIDE MY LINE OF VISION CLEARED THE TREES, I REALIZED THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING UNUSUAL. IT WAS A PURE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT, AS IF APPEARED, PHASE KILLERS WERE NOTICEABLE - WHITE - BLUE - TWO OR VARIOUS SHADES. THERE WERE NO FACETS NO NOISE AND IN A DIRECTION I HADN'T NOTICED PRIOR TO BE NATURE.

Here is the text from the document:

After it passed out of sight we kept scanning the sky - we noticed a space satellite overhead going eastward, about the size of a planet. This was about 2-3 min after warp.

The house had no phone & the neighbors were asleep. Unusual features:

(1) Warrant low altitude
(2) Low speed
(3) No sound
(4) Non flickering lights
(5) Abrupt directional change
(6) Off direction of typical aircraft maneu.

OTHER:

I used to be a skeptic
My standard report was -
"Funny - I never saw one"!
