The image contains two black and white photographs, both appearing to be of a similar scene with a white rectangular object positioned at a slight angle against a dark background. The photographs look like they might be part of a scientific or investigative document, possibly from a UFO or research report. The images are grainy and low contrast, typical of mid-20th century photographic reproduction techniques. No legible text is visible in the image.
