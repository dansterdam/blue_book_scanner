January 29, 1968

SAFOI
Washington, D.C.

Honorable Sirs:

I am eleven years old and am in sixth grade. I guess now would say that I'm an amateur astronomer. I am currently reading a book named, "UFOs" edited by Bill Adler.

It is a book about letters that are in your "Project Blue Book" files.

I'm a believer in a "flying saucer" (UFO). I have seen two but the second one was the most astonishing one.

Enclosed is a summary of minutes to me in your files. The second witness is my sister. The one she describes is the second one that I pursued with my father and sister.

The signs are sightings that my friends made.

The first my sister filled in on the survey says two of them.

Here is the text from the document:

where so light of this time plane
were not overcoming free a little
careful observation I saw that
they were U S AF bombers (Note
this was seen in Denville, N.J.)
I wish you would explain to
me why these bombers were
sent after it. I must cause you
will send out one shall we say
fighter for each UFO seen. I
have now come to the conclusion
that the Air Force is more
concerned with UFO's than said
after reports

Sincerely yours,

P.S. I if you are yet get time to
send an letter or something
back, please don't tell me
that bombers just happen-
ed to be in the area.
