Conversation with Lt. Wm. B. Stoecker (29th Air Division, Duluth, Minn.) concerning alleged UFO sighting 23 August 66 at 0455z.

Lt. Stoecker stated that they get limited information from the local airport. They do not have records of aircraft flying over the area. They only have records of aircraft that take off from the airport. Aircraft that fly over Duluth are not on records at that airport.

This explains the reason why on the initial TWIX it was reported that there were no aircraft in the area. Lt. Stoecker said that he thought several of his reports were erroneous, but the airport had no record of any taking off from the Duluth Airport at the time of the particular sightings.
