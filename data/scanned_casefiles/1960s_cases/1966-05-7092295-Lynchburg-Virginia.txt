Dear sirs:

I would like to report to you a siting of an unidentified flying object that occurred on the night of March 31, 1967. On this evening, my wife and I were outside in our backyard in Roanville, Georgia, when we noticed a strange object in the sky. It was hovering silently, and appeared to be metallic or reflective in nature. It made no sound and did not flash any lights. We watched it for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a very high speed and disappeared from view. 

We were quite surprised and disturbed by this experience, as we had never seen anything like it before. I am writing to you in hopes that you may have some insight or information on what we witnessed. Please let me know if you have any other questions or would like additional details.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

P.S. Wanna goof Around sat 20!

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference: your recent letter reporting your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 15 May 67.

At this late date, it would be extremely difficult to make a comprehensive evaluation of the sighting. It is most important that we receive the reports at the earliest possible date.

The only possible explanation that I can give is that the sighting has the characteristics of an aircraft refueling mission. Such refueling operations have been responsible for numerous UFO reports.

Enclosed is the report on Project Blue Book which you requested. Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],
Reference your recent letter reporting an unidentified flying object/observation of last summer. At this late date, it would be extremely difficult to make a comprehensive evaluation of the sighting. It is most important that we receive the reports at the earliest possible date.

The only possible explanation that I can give at this time would be that the sighting has the characteristics of an aircraft refueling mission. Such refueling exercises have been responsible for numerous UFO sightings in the past.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that contains handwritten text.

Text from the document:

The car is quite early. The object observed was slightly luminous and appeared spherical. It was observed for some few minutes and moved across the sky at a relatively high speed. The object was observed across the eastern horizon and appeared to grow dimmer as it proceeded on its course. No noise was heard. The object was first observed at a relatively low elevation in the eastern sky and moved across the sky disappearing from view. No other observers were noted. However, it is possible that others may have seen the object but did not report it. The relative speed and movement of the object across the sky suggests that it was an aircraft of some kind. It is quite likely an aircraft but could also be some other high-flying object of a relatively small size. The object was not characteristic of a satellite or a meteor. It appeared to be a definite object possessing luminosity and moving purposefully across the sky. The movement and speed of the object does not suggest a balloon, as the motion was quite definite and controlled. While the object was not tracked on radar, the visual observations suggest a reasonably solid object of some kind. This object would appear to be an unidentified flying object, the nature of which cannot be positively determined from the information available. The sighting is somewhat unusual but does not appear to be a hoax or to involve any advanced technology not presently known. The report contains no photographic evidence or physical evidence of the object, and there are no other known witnesses. The description of the object is consistent with a conventional aircraft, but the speed and controlled movement are not entirely typical. Overall, this appears to be a genuine sighting of an unidentified flying object, the nature of which cannot be conclusively determined from the available information.

The image contains a hand-drawn diagram and text descriptions. The diagram appears to depict some kind of aerial phenomenon or unidentified flying object (UFO). The text provides additional details and descriptions related to the diagram.

The text found in the document is as follows:

AUTOEOGRAPHY
I was born 1 May 1933 in Columbia, S.C. , the son of Henry Titus Walker and the late Carrie Earle Walker. I am over 6 feet tall, weigh 250 pounds, and have brown eyes and black hair. I became interested in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) sometime around 1960 when I read the book "Strangers from Space" by Frank Edwards. Since that time I have done considerable research on the subject.
SKETCH: The object was cylindrical in shape, with arms or projections extending from the sides. It hovered very low over the trees just back from the road. As it hovered, the object was illuminated by a very bright light that seemed to bathe the entire surrounding area in brilliant light. I watched the object for about two minutes as it hovered, then suddenly it shot away at tremendous speed and was gone. The diagram is a rough sketch of what I saw.

I am a fifth grader. I am to give a report on the UFOs. Could you tell me where some of the UFOs were sited in Ohio and Michigan?

Also a girl in my class said she saw something in the sky one evening. All she saw were three red lights standing still. First one would blink, about 2 or 3 minutes later the next one would blink and so on. She said they were about 15 minutes it started to move it slowly then vanished. Could you give me your opinion on this object?

Thank you very much.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper article describing a sighting of a "Flying Saucer Over Belvidere" by an 8-year-old girl while playing with her dog. The article describes the sighting, including details about the "sparkling orange and green inverted saucer" that the girl observed.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

FLYING SAUCER OVER BELVIDERE
NOTICED FIRST BY GIRL, 8, 
WHILE PLAYING WITH DOG

A sparkling orange and green inverted saucer which turned completely while at a high altitude over Belvidere was first noticed by Martha Stewart of 401 Mansfield St., the object had "square windows." The girl, who was playing with her dog in the back yard, saw the odd object above her. Although, she added, it appeared to be quite a distance away.

EASTON EXPRESS, FRIDAY, MAY 6, 1966

Mrs. Stewart said her daughter told her she saw the saucer while playing with the dog. Mrs. Stewart said the object was quite close at first, then appeared to go further away. Her daughter told her the object seemed to be turning as it moved up and away. Mrs. Stewart said her daughter was quite upset, but Mrs. Stewart said she did not see the object herself.

Mrs. Stewart called her husband at his place of business and he, in turn, called a neighbor who came to the house to investigate. However, the object had disappeared by the time the neighbor arrived. A passing motorist, however, noticed the commotion at the Stewart home and stopped to see what was happening. He also looked at the sky but did not see the object.

Mrs. Stewart said her daughter was quite upset. Mrs. Stewart said she thought she noticed the object through a window, but when she looked out she could not see anything. She said her son wanted to take the little girl to a doctor because she was so disturbed by what she had seen.

Mrs. Stewart said she kept her child in the house after the incident occurring at 5:30 p.m. to put the children in bed. When her husband came home, he said he did not see anything but said he would watch for the saucer again the next day. Mrs. Stewart said that when her husband came home, her daughter told him what she had seen. Asked if she planned to keep a lookout for flying saucers, Mrs. Stewart said she would be more concerned with other matters and probably think I'm a "peeping Tom."

UFO CASE INFO ONLY 14'57-66?

Call from Battle Creek, Michigan, 17 May 66 (phone area 616 - 965-11 ext 617)17)  

I saw an aircraft, a Navy blimp. Checked with the radar boys. Have seen it enough times that may be we can identify blimp. 60 - 70 feet long, 17 - 18 feet in diameter, hydrogen fired. Because of its take off speed and the way it appears, 4.5 deg comes in between 30 - 45 deg. Comes in over the hills. When he takes off on Saturday.  

From the time he raises up and lifts his nose, gradually takes off and system up. Out of night 30 - 40 seconds. Seen this many times. Two story blimp, the engines in the bottom scary. Talked to radar people and they didn't have anything (Kustard) that's why he is disturbed. Talked to navy officers and some of the naval aviators and they said they never had anything on it. One boy said that it wasn't picked up on radar. He got this from his friend at Kustard. When saw it at them. Figures that it is an experimental aircraft. When it comes to him it scares him. Nothing about this craft that basic physics cannot build. This thing is probably firing through a torsion arc. Said that Gusard APB is going to send us a report but he would send it writing about what he saw so that we would be helped in identifying it and that maybe it will solve other cases.
