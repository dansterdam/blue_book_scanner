Dear Sirs:                                                   Mar. 31, 1967

I do not remember exactly when & might saw object, night sky or somewhere else.

My next door neighbor and I were coming out, we might have seen something like a new kind of a network, and which started as a very bright spot. It began to move across the sky, I was somehow sure that it was not a plane, we did not have my telescope out, we watched it for some time, it looked like a triangular in shape, moving over head, it looked like a triangle in shape. I could not make out the details, it was moving directly over head and this small object was so high up and speed at times 35 degrees, sometimes 5 min. 

P.S. Would you please send this and tell me what you think of it. I would also like to know if you have my sister's part of "Blue Book"

Dear Mr [redacted]

Reference your recent letter reporting your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of last summer.

At this late date, it would be extremely difficult to make a comprehensive evaluation of the sighting. It is most important that we receive the reports as early as possible.

The only possible explanation that I can give is that the sighting has the characteristics of an aircraft refueling mission. Such refueling exercises have been responsible for numerous UFO sightings in the past.

Enclosed is the report on Project Blue Book which you requested. Your interest in our program is appreciated.

HEADQUARTERS AEROSPACE DEFENSE COMMAND
Wright-Patterson AFB, OH
Dayton, Ohio

September 23, 1966

To who it may concern:

Enclosed is the material to our study of an unidentified flying object, some portion of which is a request an evaluation.

DATE: 20 Dec 65, 1st loc., 20h 15m.
PLACE: Lynchburg, Va.
WITNESSES: 1 - civilian
SUMMARY: While driving on a clear, down lite, no clouds over, discernible, except on the horizon, dark and hazy, a few miles west of Lynchburg, Va., witness saw a bright light.

Bright light was initially a bright stone - he believes, possibly a satellite, tempo a old a color, was a white or yellowish light. Witness pulled car over to side of road, approximately 15-50 degrees above NE., South (short loc.), at the time of the occurrence, I was playing ball with some friends.

Following exact location: corner public school(1) 1/2 mi., 6-7 mi. at dark approx. 15-20 mi. from Lynchburg, Va. near 3 schools: Brookville, Peakland, about 60 sec. partly left for the act. to 15-20 sec. was 1 1/2 for approx. 15-20 minutes, though 15 could be more. Witness(1): The speed was very slow, however of planes.

Witness(1): Blu "abnormal"(1) its apparent reflective light source (from the sun)(1) was so study, I concluded beyond little doubt that it had a spherical, or ellipsoidal shape. The first to obviously more difficult was it a balloon? The jack of detail was the constant reflection, mass such as hypotheses very probable. "The object was traveling about 10-15 degrees above the horizon," in the same manner which a jet does. The sketch on the following page(s) emphasize this factor.

I am an amateur meteorologist of 2 or 3 years standing, and have studied to a moderate extent unusual weather phenomena. However, I am inclined to accept the type of cases that the 1st source was of a meteorological explanation, for various reasons: (1) The steady lighting and constant movement, in the same direction, recently indicate (2) some indefinite control(3) of an intelligent nature - a balloon. Worst assumption is that it was not a "roby Dick" plant aerial research balloon.

The object was definitely a point of light, not ordinary light phenomena. No source appear to be reflective. This is not consistent of any aerial phenomena that I have seen. I never expect a meteor. I am certain that the UFO was not a balloon, the possibility I could have seen reflecting of the sun's rays ice crystals is unlikely, as no other explanation fits the conditions at the time. I have watched the skies for years and certainly am capable of identifying known phenomena. Meteorologic, the ballistic answer, if there is one by modern rational examination, is the most likely, but who can say. If wasn't an intelligently controlled vehicle, that are not the baseful side on that bright afternoon, at a good position to observe.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

I was born May 11th, 1953, in Columbus, Ga., USA. My father and the rest of my family moved to Toronto in 1956, where my father, a physician, MD, planned to do other specialties. I was born with a congenital defect of the small intestine(?) and was hospitalized. Two 1900 through 2001 attended Grades 2 and 3 in public school. I spent a year in hospital. Upon last public school, I was able to catch up with my class, and I was able to do well in my studies.

I am 13 years old.

I assure you every typewritten word you have read so far is correct, and unaltered.

[The document also contains several hand-drawn diagrams:
- A circular diagram with "sitting sun", "myself", and other annotations
- A fan-shaped diagram with angle measurements
- A sketch of what appears to be industrial buildings or structures labeled "3 factory chimneys" and "3 factory smokepipes"]

Dear Major Quintanella,

I am a sixth grader. I am to give a report on the UFOs. Could you tell me where some of the UFOs were sited in Ohio and Michigan?

Also a girl in my class said she saw something in the sky one evening. All she saw were three red lights standing still. First one would blink, about 2 or 3 minutes later the next one would blink and so on. She said she watched it about 15 minutes it started to move so slowly then vanished. Would you give me your opinion on this object?

Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Sir(s),

I suppose you have received many wild and unbelievable letters on flying saucers, but please believe mine!

I was staying at my friends at the time. I was walking west down to our soda bar after school, when we saw the odd looking object. At first we thought it was just a plane, but, there were different physical changes in the shape as the object moved closer to the tree.

TIME - 5:10 p.m - THURSDAY - MAY 4, 1966 - NIAGARA FALLS
DIRECTION - no real direction - stayed stationary
SHAPE - OVAL (egg shape) - position but soared up and down from time to time.
HEIGHT - about 50 ft. above tall poplars.
DURATION - five minutes roughly.
COLOUR - Pinkish and grey
SOUND - a continuous humming.
ANGLE - I could only see the bottom and the side.
SIZE - Little larger than moon.
CONDITION OF SKY - only a few slight wisps of clouds.

MAIN FACTOR - two claw like hands and an green beam - I am not to sure about this as it happened very quickly.

After my friend and I had seen the source for

Flying Saucer Over Belvidere
Noticed First By Girl, 8,
While Playing With Dog

A "sparkling orange and green" inverted saucer which turned completely white at times" hovered over Belvidere for more than an hour last night. According to Mrs. Bruce Stewart, of 401 Mansfield St., the object had "square, windows on the bottom--like an observation room--and actually looked quite large." Although, she added, it appeared to be quite a distance away.

The saucer was first noticed by Mrs. Stewart's daughter, Holly, 8, who was playing with her dog near their home shortly before 9 o'clock. Holly called to her mother, "Mommy, look what's coming!"

Mrs. Stewart and her other children, Robert, 10, and Kim, 5, joined Holly.

Mrs. Stewart said the object "made a circle around the house and then seemed to come closer." She said it was hovering across the street. "Mrs. Stewart noted that the saucer began to glow red and green." "I thought it would burn out, but it just stayed there," she said. Using her husband's field glasses, she said, to compare the object with the stars in the sky, "But the stars were not like the saucer at all," she added.

Mrs. Stewart called her husband at his place of business, Stewart Chevrolet Co., but was told he was at a meeting. She then called a neighbor, Joseph McDowell, who was "busy packing her husband's lunch." However, another neighbor, Joseph McDonald, responded and looked at the object. "Maybe the reports of flying saucers are true," the commented.

"Kim was quite upset," Mrs. Stewart said. "She thought Martians were landing." She said her son wanted to take pictures, but "we didn't have the film for taking night pictures."

Mrs. Stewart gave up the vigil at 9:30 p.m. to put the children to bed. When she went outside again at 10 p.m. the object was still there, she said. "But," she said "when my husband came home at quarter to 11, it was gone."

Asked if she planned to keep on the lookout for flying saucers, Mrs. Stewart commented, "When the dog walks the dog every night, I'll take the binoculars along. The neighbors will probably think I'm a Peeping Tom."

NO CASE                                                        INFO ONLY

Call from _______, Battle Creek, Michigan, 17 May 66 (phone area 616 265-11 ext 6171?)

I saw an aircraft, a Navy blimp. Checked with the radar boys. Have seen it enough times that may be we can identify blimp. 60 - 70 feet long, 17 - 18 feet in diameter, hydrogen fired. Because of its take off speed and the way it appears, 45 deg angle, comes in between 30 - 45 deg. Comes in over the hills. When he takes off on Saturday. From the time he lifts up and lifts his nose, gradually takes off and systems up. Out of sight 30 - 40 seconds. Seen this many times. Two story blimp, the engines in the bottom story. Talked to radar people and they didn't have anything (Kustard) that's why he is worried. Talked to Navy officers and some of the naval aviators and they said they never had anything on it. One boy said that it wasn't picked up on radar. He got this from his friend at Kustard. Saw it at 11am. Figures that it is an experimental aircraft. When it comes to him it scares him. Nothing about this craft that basic physics cannot built. This thing is probably firing through a tungsten arc. Said that Kustard AFB has going to send us a report but he would send his writing about what he saw so that we would be helped in identifying it and that maybe it will solve other cases.

Call to P.I.O.
