2. LOCATION: Richland, Wash.
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 31 hours

10. CONCLUSION: Astronomer(s)
An object, which began to rise at an elevation of 12 degrees and 59 minutes at approximately 2600L, was observed by three witnesses. Observers noted the object was luminous and strange and gray with the center and dark edges. The object was seen along the eastern horizon line. The object was last observed as a very high altitude observation. The observers noticed before it disappeared.
The description is consistent with that of an astronomical object, which began to rise at approximately 2600L, would have been visible during the observation time.
