10. CONCLUSION
Astro(Rigel)
621001 Rigel was at an elevation of 12 degrees and
on an azimuth of 112 degrees.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted circular-oval shaped object that looked orange with the naked eye and orange and grey with the telescope. The object was seen in the east at telephone line altitude. The object was last observed at a very high angle of elevation. The observers retired before the object disappeared.

The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Rigel, which began to rise at approximately 2000L, would have been visible during the observation time.
