August 5, 1966

UFO Office
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Gentlemen:

Yesterday, the radio news mentioned someone reporting a brilliant blue-green light travelling north to north. I myself was having where with the person saw it, but several weeks ago I saw exactly the same thing, for about 2 seconds. He was at a low angle in the sky and followed a line thus _____ & travelling north to north.

It didn't seem the right angle maybe, the right color for a falling star.

I just wanted to confirm what the individual reported seeing.

Yours truly,

Observer noted a very brilliant metallic silver object that made no sound. The object kept moving at a steady speed until it disappeared below the horizon. Object looked like two dimes glued together with the edges filled down to give the dimes a sharp edge.

The sighting took place near sunset. A high flying aircraft would have been visible since the sun would be illuminating the aircraft. Sunset was at about 1955 on the 6 July 66.

Dear [redacted]:

Our office received numerous calls concerning the observance of a suspected unidentified flying object that was over the Dayton area on the nights of 13 and 19 July 1966.

We were able to contact Mr. [redacted] of Barnes Aerial Advertising, Winchester, Kentucky. On the nights of 13 and 19 July, Mr. [redacted] was flying a 1959 Champion Aircraft with an advertising sign that had a series of lights on the bottom of the plane. From either side of the craft, in the distance, the advertising appears as a row of blinking or revolving lights. Mr. [redacted] stated that a person had to be directly under the plane in order to read the sign.

I feel sure this was what you and the others observed. There was no unusual objects reported by the local radar authorities.

I wish to thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

19 Jul 66

Conversation with Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ (19 Jul 66) of Barnes Aerial Advertising, Winchester, Kentucky was flying the night of 18 July in the Dayton area. Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ was flying a 1959 Champion Aircraft with an advertising sign that had a series of lights on the bottom of plane. The plane landed at Montgomery County Airport to refuel before circling the Dayton area. Aircraft was advertising for Borchers Ford's 1966 close out sale. Onthe bottom of the plane are a series of lights. From either side of the craft in the distance the advertising appears only as a row of blinking lights. Area representative is Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ who will call us about â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ next flight in this and the surrounding area.

Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ contacts WP RAPCON on each flight in this area. He has been flying around the Cincinnati Area since April, refuelling at the Greater Cincinnati Airport.

Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ said that a person would have to be directly underneath the plane in order to read the sign. Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ going to send the Project Office a picture of his plane.

Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ informed the project office that he would be flying over the Dayton area on the evening of 19 Jul 66, 2030 - 2230 hours.

Conversations of 19 July 1966regarding observations on the night of 18 Jul 66

Check with WHIO. The man who answered the switchboard said that he didn't have anything in his script about the UFOs last being a neon sign for a car dealer flying over Dayton. He said to listen to the 8 o'clock news.

Check with the Clinton County AFB, Ohio Weather Bureau - Negative.

Check with the Police Department - specifically Lt Rado. He observed what he assumed to be a sign being towed by a commercial plane. The object appeared to being going East to West, thought it was probably over Springborg. Looked to be at about 1000 ft, probably around 8 and 9 pm. If we want further information check with the Records people, Sgt Hanby. Rado hadn't given any further thought to the observation because it definitely appeared as a/c with banner in tow. He had been down to watch the Cincinnati Reds play ball the other week when Frisch's had a similar banner flying over the ball park for approximately one hour.

Spoke with WHIO newsroom. They had gotten their information from the newspaper and therefore didn't know who the car dealer was.

Contacted Montgomery County Airport 866-2427 Radio Room
There has been a man flying different advertising and he is from Winchester, Kentucky. She is going to have this man call us when he comes in for she didn't know if he was flying last night or not.

A citizen from he Dayton area called on 19 Jul 66. What he observed last night sounded like a piper cub towing pulsating lights, lights would go West to East. Plane was flying SE towards Cincinnati and Virginia. He had called WING radio station and they told him not to worry about it. He said he and his two friends thought it sounded like a piper cub.

NEGATIVE REPORTS FROM:
Stenger's Ford Co         Peffley Ford Co         FAA, W-P AFB
Vandalia Airport           Tower at W-P AFB        Clinton County AFS

Call from [redacted], Marysville, Pa 17053
who is visiting in the Dayton area. He saw an object traveling SW to NW. He never say anything like it and he certainly knows what an a/c looks like. This didn't have caution lights. Lights seemed to revolve slowly. It would go slow and then fast, disappeared near the Frigidaire tower. It was like twenty lights surrounding. They would be on and then off. Called the base last night, 18 Jul 66 at 257-0122 and the guy who answered said he was looking for them but couldn't see them. Ulrich thought the guy should be able to see them but really wasn't looking. Lt. Marley explained that certain portions of W-P are at quite a distance from Dayton and they might not be able to observe it. Sent a Form 164 on 19 Jul at his request.

This Morning's Briefs

That "Saucer"
You Saw Was
Only An Ad

An airplane trailing an advertisement for a local auto dealer apparently missed its mark last night, prompting a rash of reports of sightings of an unidentified flying object.
Few saw the lettering even though one man insisted the aircraft was only 200 feet above the ground.

"Apparently the pilot was flying a little too high," a spokesman for the auto dealer said, trying to explain why the advertising was not easily visible.

Callers described the aircraft as a "double-decked disk all lit up ... and rotating," and a "mass of lights, changing forms, flying high as a jet, egg-shaped, like light bulbs on a pole."

Tom Weaver, 413 Forest Park drive, said he spotted the object above North Main Street at about 9:15 p.m. seeming to hover about 200 feet above the ground.

"I'm a graduate of Purdue university with a major in civil engineering. I don't believe in this kind of thing" (UFOs) but I saw it.

143 To Be Drafted In August

There will be 143 Montgomery county men drafted into the service in August, Selective Service officials announced yesterday.

The men will be part of a state-wide draft of 5,585 men, compared with 2,783 in July. Officials said the "gross" call would lead to the induction of 3,207 men, compared with 1,671 last month.

Other area counties and their draft calls are: Miami, 83; Preble, 5; and Shelby, 8.

Musician Fined In Dope Case

A 25-year-old musician was fined $500 yesterday after he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of a narcotics violation. Robert Lee Oliver, 25, of 4001 Whitestone drive, was arrested after police confiscated marijuana at his home. He had been charged with a felony, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of maintaining a place where narcotics are kept.

Oliver was fined by common pleas Judge Cecil Edwards.
