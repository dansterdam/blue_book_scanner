11. COMMENTS
Formalhaut described in rpt for most of the period. Obj rate of motion constant w/the movement of an astro body. It is difficult to understand how this 1st mag star was maintained by the naval unit spring it is a UFO. However, since the position coincides w/that of the star case is good. Distortion due to atmospheric conditions.
