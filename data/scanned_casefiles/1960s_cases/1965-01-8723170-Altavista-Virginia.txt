11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS 
Objects observed in erratic pattern maneuvering in and around 5 A/C. Lights observed from 27/0 to 29/0. At 1st sighting lights appeared to be flashing and then reappear at a different location. This occurred on several occasions and the objects appeared to be independent of the aircraft. Only one object observed at a time.

COMMENTS: According to Capt. Rives, 1st Lieut. ARS at Dover Control, this area is in use only at 17:00 on 27th & 23:00-23:30 from Dover Control purposes. AROC search supervisor confirmed that no flights were operating in this area at the sighting time and that two refuelings were in the approximate location.
