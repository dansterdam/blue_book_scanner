Request for UFO Information on Sightings, 1 Sep 66

Hq USAF (SAFOI0C)
Attn: Mrs. Hunt

Reference the attached letter requesting information on sightings on 1 September 1966. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Mr. [redacted]

Reference your letter of 3 September 1966 concerning your observation of an unusual phenomena over the Tulsa skys on the night of 1 September 1966.

Your sighting has been studied in detail and we have found that you probably observed the satellite, ECHO 1. ECHO 1 was passing over the Tulsa area at approximately 2100 hours on 1 September, traveling in an ESE direction. The description you provided is consistent with that of satellite observations. Fluctuations in light skin to the twirling of stars can cause the illusion of zig-zag motion. Indeed, observations show that the fluctuations are closely related to meteorological conditions.

Dear Mr

SEP 22 1966

Reference is made to your letter of September 3, 1966, concerning your observation of an unusual phenomenon in the Tulsa area on the night of September 1, 1966.

Your sighting has been studied in detail, and we feel that you probably observed the satellite, ECHO I. ECHO I was passing over the Tulsa area at approximately 9:00 p.m. on September 1, traveling in an ESE direction. The description you provided is consistent with that of satellite observations. Fluctuations in light akin to the twinkling of stars can also cause the illusion of zigzag motion. Observations show that the fluctuations are closely related to meteorological conditions.

Dear Major Quintanilla,

As I write this letter I write for my brother, my mother and myself. The following phenomena as I saw it nothing but plain facts. We are of sound mind and have come to the conclusion that all three of us were not seeing things.

On the night of September first, 1966 at approximately one o'clock until standard time she three of us witnessed a very strange phenomena.

My neighbor and I were on the front porch of my home discussing unidentified fifty objects I saw they were unbelievable the speed to believe in them. As a scene I stepped him on the shoulder and said "I ask up there"; pointing to a bright star.

To our shock it was not a star. My little brother - popped up behind our truck and shouted "You stupid!"

It was an unusually bright water near object with a pulsating light that changed from a red to white. This seemed to spin brightly every ten seconds approximately then swaying in steady system.

The source where we first sighted it was, on

Here is the text from the document:

clear as we saw satellite 21 at sky west north for approach.
few seconds then stopped and came straight west till
it came almost of a bright planet or sun and minutely
went to East by west north, for about one and one half
minutes then for southeast. A few about three minutes,
it dimmed then brightened & it seemed to be flying
enter a large black object backdrop now center
and disappear.

It all lasted approximately ten five minutes. All
time and direction are approximate. We will be
waiting your reply & if it is possible would you send
some copies of your reply.

Sincerely,

P.S. Enclosed are some drawings & I made that we all
agree are fairly accurate.
