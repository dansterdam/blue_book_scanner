ASTRONOMY
SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR JANUARY 27, 1962
Winter Stars Now at Best
February Is the best month for viewing the brilliant winter constellations. The "seven sisters" of the Pleiades may be seen on a clear night, James Stokley reports.

WITH THE COMING OF FEBRUARY, the brilliant constellations of winter are at their best. The sky map on the accompanying page, which depicts the stars that are high in the sky at 9 p.m. in late February, shows the positions of some of the most prominent stars and constellations visible at that hour.
At this time of year, as in January, no planets are among the brightest objects in the sky. But the star Sirius, the brightest star visible from most of the United States, is high in the southwest. The brightest star shown on the star chart is Sirius, denoted by the largest symbol. The second brightest star shown is Capella, called Auriga or the "charioteer." The smaller it is, the brighter it is. Capella is the fifth-brightest star in the sky.

THE PLEIADES
One of the prominent winter star groups is the cluster called the Pleiades, or the "seven sisters." This is the most beautiful star cluster visible to the naked eye. The six or seven stars that can be seen with the unaided eye are really only a small part of this cluster, which contains hundreds of stars. They form a little dipper-shaped figure in the sky. Their rule is less than seven-minutes 1.45 cubic light-years in diameter, and they are some 410 light-years away from the earth. The cluster is Proceeding still at a brilliant star, though only a small part of it can be seen with the naked eye.
It is interesting to note that the stars in the Pleiades appear scattered, though they are really quite close together. This feature comes from the fact that the three stars with ones much brighter are the real members of the system, while the fainter ones around them may be either more distant members or stars that merely happen to lie in the same direction as seen from the earth. Similarly, the gap between Rigel and Betelgeuse, two brilliant winter stars, is illusory - they are really some 400 light-years apart, though they appear close together in the sky. Still further than Orion and Cassiopeia form a striking seasonal pair of stars that can be seen high in the evening northern sky, especially in late winter and early spring. But these are seldom used for navigation.
As the skies grow darker, the star Sirius, the dog star, is the one that stands out most prominently in the southwest. At lower latitudes, Canopus, the second brightest star, is also visible. But Sirius is the sky's brightest star visible to most Americans. High above, the twins, Pollux and Castor, form the famous Gemini, the Twins constellation. And near the Pleiades, the W-shaped Cassiopeia is another conspicuous winter star group.
Do not, in the east, the Lion, is the notable Regulus, the first-magnitude star that forms the end of the sickle-shaped figure of Leo, the Lion. This is dominated by the bright Arcturus, which appears in the east in late winter.
Such phenomena as these describe some features of these maps that reflect the varying appearances of the night sky from season to season as the earth orbits the sun.

Science News Letter for January 27, 1962

Winter Stars at Best

This is the time of year covered by the dark sky of the moon - will be in the sky until late Saturday - and so the stars will be most brilliantly visible, especially the winter constellations like Orion, Taurus and Auriga.

After the full moon, the sun will be totally obscured by the moon for a short time on February 5. This will be a total eclipse of the sun, taking place within the Caspian Sea area. The eclipse will last about 2 1/2 minutes. The path of totality will be fairly narrow, so the area for good observation will be restricted.

Along the eclipse track, in the direction of California, the sun will be totally obscured for a maximum of about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. On the East Coast, the eclipse will be only a partial one.

Celestial Time Table for February:

2 9:30 a.m. Total eclipse of sun, beginning
3 10:09 a.m. Total eclipse ends
8 4:17 p.m. Moon at first quarter
13 10:43 a.m. Full moon
20 9:26 a.m. Moon at last quarter 
27 10:10 a.m. New moon
MST, and three hours for PST.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:
25 Feb 66
Subj: Call from
California, phone 
He said he was interested in aerial phenomena and that last night (24 Feb 66) he and 
were talking about their sighting of 1962, in February, when they were drinking, he said you talk about this when your drinking. He knows its four years ago but he wanted to know about it. He's an ex Navy fly boy, altitude of object approximately 40 foot, 15 ft in length and diameter, no means of propulsion. Just curious about object, aqua, grayish color, sausage shape, approximately observed in February 1962 in Los Angeles area, no other witnesses other than he and his friend
phone, Los Angeles, California.  He asked Sgt Jones (Mr 
called Sgt Jones his pal) if they had anything then. Sgt Jones mentioned some reports that there were nighthings in the LA area, asked Jones if he ever got a report like this. Jones said that we have had objects of the same color nature reported, sometimes they were aircraft and others could be something else, but this couldn't say what it was without more of a description. He said that well pal, you just said it was an aircraft,  said that it couldn't be an aircraft, quite convinced that there was something there. Stunt on both ends like a sausage. expected an analysis over the telephone. Jones asked if we could send a form for him and his friend to fill out as he was only on the administrative end of typing and filing and that he couldn't tell him what it was because the evaluator was not in the office today.  
NOTE:  admitted that he had been drinking, he also sounded intoxicated.
Sent form 1624a on 23 Feb 66.

New Plymouth mystery object
The Plymouth Evening Post of 8th Jan 1962 carried an item about a strange object seen in the sky by several people in the New Plymouth area. The object was reported as being "a bright flickering light" and was observed for about an hour as it moved hither and thither in the sky. One observer is reported as saying the object was about a quarter the size of the full moon. The light would brighten and fade, sometimes disappearing and reappearing. After about an hour it suddenly blacked out and was not seen again. The observers had the impression of something controlled or intelligently directed. No other details given.

FED 20, 1962 GLENN FLIGHT (NO CASE, INFORMATION)

RECENT USAF REPORT

COLONEL GLENN SIGNED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS WHILE IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH. HE SAW ABOUT 20 OF THEM MOVING VERY RAPIDLY AS HE WAS ORBITED AROUND THE EARTH. HE TRIED TO TAKE PICTURES OF THEM BUT THEY WERE MOVING MUCH TOO FAST.

AT THE TIME OF REENTRY, SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE GLENN TOUCHED DOWN, HIS CAPSULE WAS SEEN BY A GROUND OBSERVER ON THE WEST COAST TO HAVE A BRIGHT LUMINOUS OBJECT ALONGSIDE OF IT, MUCH LARGER THAN THE CAPSULE ITSELF. THIS OBJECT CAME TO WITHIN 50 FEET OF THE CAPSULE AND THEN SHOT AWAY AT A FANTASTIC SPEED. THE GROUND OBSERVER VERIFIED THIS IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT AND WAS JUST AS SURPRISED AT THE FIRSH SIGHTING AS GLENN WAS ON HIS.

IT IS JUST AS THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN BROKE THE HORIZON THAT THESE BRIGHT OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED. AND IT WAS NOTED THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE BRIGHT, BLUISH-WHITE IN COLOR AND OF TREMENDOUS SPEED. THEY STAYED IN VIEW FOR A MATTER OF SECONDS, 4-5 SECONDS TO BE EXACT, AND THEN THEY WERE GONE. NO SOUND ACCOMPANIED THEM, AND IT WAS JUST BARELY LIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE THEM.

THIS CONDITION WOULD FAVOR THE THEORY THAT THEY WERE NOTHING MORE THAN REFLECTIONS FROM THE SUNLIGHT AND MOISTURE IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE. HOWEVER, COLONEL GLENN STATED HE COULD SEE THE OUTLINES OF THESE OBJECTS AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPACE AND THEY WERE SHARPLY DEFINED. THESE WERE NOT JUST SPARKLING LIGHTS, BUT METALLIC OBJECTS.

THE MORE LIKELY THEORY ADVANCED IS THAT THEY WERE SATELLITES OR OTHER MAN-MADE OBJECTS IN ORBIT. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS ATTRIBUTED TO THEM AND WHICH WERE PROBABLY NOTED BY BOTH GLENN AND THE GROUND OBSERVER, ARE NOT IN KEEPING WITH KNOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SATELLITES. THE FACT THAT SOME OF THEM CAME TO WITHIN 50 FEET OF THE CAPSULE, MOVED AT FANTASTIC SPEEDS, AND THEN SHOT AWAY, SEEMS TO INDICATE SOME DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE DIRECTED CONTROL.

THIS WOULD SEEM TO LEND SOME SLIGHT SUPPORT TO THE THEORY THAT THEY WERE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OF SOME KIND. OF COURSE, SINCE NO REALLY GOOD PHOTOGRAPHS WERE OBTAINED, WE MUST RELY ON THE VISUAL OBSERVATIONS OF BOTH GLENN AND THE GROUND OBSERVER. SUCH VISUAL OBSERVATIONS, WHILE CERTAINLY IMPRESSIVE, DO NOT CONSTITUTE CONCLUSIVE PROOF. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT DEFINITELY IDENTIFY WHAT GLENN AND THE GROUND OBSERVER SAW. IT IS ANOTHER VERY INTERESTING PHENOMENON FROM THE GLENN FLIGHT IS SHOWN THAT MERITS FURTHER STUDY AND INVESTIGATION.

THE ABOVE IS THE MOST CURRENT AND SUMMARY REPORT FROM THE U.S. AIR FORCE ON THIS INCIDENT. THIS WILL BE KEPT IN THE BLUE BOOK FILES FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

The image contains a photograph of a UFO sighting, as described in the text. The text discusses a camera photograph taken by a Mr. John Shaw and David Brown, who reported seeing five dark objects in the sky near Sheffield, England in February 1962. The text provides details about the sighting and the subsequent investigation.

No case (Information Only)                                      25 February 1962
                                                          Sheffield, England

WITNESS: D - SHEFFIELD: Last Feb.,1962, a Mr. John Shaw and David Brown were taking an afternoon walk near Sheffield, England, when they saw five dark objects in the sky. They were not moving and made no sound. The objects were estimated to be about 100 to 200 yards away. The time was about 1300 hours. The objects were seen for about 10 minutes. Mr. Shaw managed to take a camera photo of the objects before they disappeared. No lights or vapour trails were seen. The photo was passed on to the authorities, and it was later examined by experts. The initial assessment seemed to indicate that the objects were real and not some kind of hoax or trick photography. However, the conclusive nature of the evidence was not entirely clear and the matter remains unresolved. The photograph shows several dark, indistinct objects in the sky.
