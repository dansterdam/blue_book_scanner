SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for January 27, 1962

ASTRONOMY

Winter Stars Now at Best
February is the best month for viewing the brilliant winter constellations. The "seven sisters" of the Pleiades may be seen on a clear dark night, James Stokley reports.

> WITH THE COMING of February, the brilliant constellations of winter are at their best. The accompanying maps, which depict the skies as they look about ten p.m., your own kind of standard time, at the first of February. By the middle of the month they will have the same appearance about nine o'clock. At the end of the month, eight is the correct time.

However, as in January, no planets are shown. All of the five that reach naked eye visibility are so nearly in line with the sun that they cannot now be seen.

The brightest star now seen is Sirius, directly south. This is in the constellation of Canis Major, the great dog. Astronomers indicate the brightness of a star by the units called magnitude, the smaller it is, the brighter is the star. Sirius is so much brighter (nearly 11 times) than a typical first magnitude star that its magnitude is less than zero—minus 1.45.

Canis Major is one of two dogs among the constellations. The other is larger in the sky: Canis Minor, the little dog. In it, Procyon, still a bright star though only about a tenth as bright as Sirius.

At a tenth of a magnitude are some maps which showed the figures around the stars, the dogs accompanying Orion, the warrior. He is above and to the right of Canis Major.

The feature to look for here is a row of three stars with one much brighter above and below. The upper is called Betelgeuse and the lower Rigel. Both of these are among the first magnitude. The three stars in a row between Rigel and Betelgeuse form Orion's belt. These are second magnitude, and possess individual names: Mintaka, Alnilam and Alnitak. These are left to right—but these are seldom used.

Still higher than Orion, and farther right, you will find a brilliant and reddish star called Aldebaran, which is in Taurus, the bull. The star marks the bull's eye, a little to the right is the famous loose star cluster called the Hyades. And above that is Auriga, the charioteer. Its brightest star is Capella, shown on the map of the northern sky.

High in the south, above Canis Minor, are Gemini, the twins. Here the brightest star is Pollux. The brother, Castor, is just as bright, but since he is a little fainter (second magnitude) they evidently are not identical twins.

Over in the east, in Leo, the lion, is the star called Regulus. This is the top of the first magnitude star group. Regulus is the brightest star in the sky that is somewhat dimmed by atmospheric absorption. It is one of the features of these maps that such absorption is somewhat dimmed.

Winter Stars at Best
(Continued from page 50)

will be partly covered by the dark disk of
the moon.

However, the moon will completely cover
the sun, and a total eclipse will be visible
along a path 60 to 100 miles wide. This
starts in Borneo as the sun is rising, then
passes over the Celebes Islands, Dutch
Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and, after a
long stretch of open ocean, Palmyra Island,
which is about 1,300 miles south of Hono-
lulu. After that the path goes toward the
northeast, ending as the sun is setting
about a thousand miles west of lower
California.

At Palmyra, the sun will be totally
eclipsed for more than three minutes. At
Salamata, at the eastern end of New
Guinea, the eclipse will last about 2½ min-
utes. Further east and west of this point
and the sun will be more poorly placed in
the sky. However, many astronomers have
taken up positions along the eclipse track
to observe features of the sun that can best
be studied when the moon hides the bril-
liant solar disk.

Subtract one hour for CST, two hours for

Look for the Pleiades
If your eyesight is unusually keen, and
you have a dark, clear night, you may be
able to see two or three more of the
Pleiades. With even a small telescope you
can see over a hundred astronomical
photographs reveal thousands.

Try looking at them with binoculars or
even opera glasses. Some of the stars you
will see are shown on the special map. Find
the Pleiades in the southwestern sky in
Taurus. Face south and hold the map of
the sky at arm's length. Now move your right
to the southwest, rotating the map to the
right so that the upper left hand corner
points directly upward. The map then
matches the actual position of the Pleiades
in the sky.

The six that are usually seen with the
naked eye are Atlas (magnitude 4.5),
Alcyone (3), Merope (5), Maia (4), Tau-
geta (5.1) and Electra (4.6). Pleiades,
Sterope and Celaeno are each about 6.5
magnitude, and it is generally considered
that the fifth magnitude is about the faint-
est that can be seen without optical aid.

In plotting the motions of the stars,
astronomers have found that those in the
star cluster move together like a flock
of birds. They are moving along lines that
are really parallel but which seem to converge, on account of perspective. They are
converging toward a point in Orion, a little
to the east of Betelgeuse. Quite a number of
faint stars near the Pleiades are moving in
the same way, thus demonstrating their
membership in the cluster.

A present the Pleiades are at a distance
that their light, traveling 186,000 miles
every second, takes nearly 500 years to reach
us. Large telescopes, such as those at the
large observatory telescopes, show that the
stars are enveloped in a cloud of dust,
which shows up by starlight that it
reflects.

February brings the year's first eclipse,
but not much of it will be seen in the
United States and Canada. Along the west
coast the sun, just as it is setting on Feb. 4,

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:                                   25 Feb 66

Subj:  Call from                                  California, phone
        as taken by SSgt H Jones, at 0750, 25 Feb 66.

He said he was interested in aerial phenomena and that last night (24 Feb 66) he and
were talking about their sighting of 1962, in February, when they were
drinking, he said you talk about this when your drinking. He knows its four years
ago but he still wanted to know about it. He's an ex Navy fly boy, altitude of
Object approximately 40 foot, 15 ft in length and diameter, no means of propulsion,
Just curious about object, aqua, grayish color, sausage shape, approximately observed
in February 1962 in Los Angeles area, no other witnesses other than he and his friend
phone is                 Los Angeles, California. He asked
Sgt Jones (Mr                called Sgt Jones his pal) if they had anything then. Sgt Jones
checked file and reported that there were no sightings at that time in the LA area.
asked Jones if he ever got a report like this? Jones said that we have had
Objects of the same color nature reported,sometimes they were aircraft and others
clouds, etc. He told Jones that this couldn't have been an aircraft. Jones said that
we couldn't say what it was without more of a description. He said that well pal, you
just said it was an aircraft.        said that it couldn't be an aircraft, quite convinced
that there was something there. Blunt on both ends like a sausage.        expected an
analysis over the telephone. Jones asked if we could send a form for him and his
friend to fill out as he was only on the administrative end of typing and filling and
that he couldn't tell him what it was because the evaluator was not in the office today.

Hoggee said yes he would fill out forms.

NOTE:        admitted that he had been drinking, he also sounded intoxicated.

Sent Form 164s on 29 Feb 66.

New Plymouth mystery object

The Wellington Post on Feb- 
ruary 14 reported as follows: 
"Mysterious bright bullet-like 
object was seen in the New 
Plymouth sky last night. New 
Plymouth listeners who watched 
the object for about 10 seconds 
said it was definitely not a 
meteor."

Mr H. Edwards who was 
near the New Plymouth survey station, said the 
object searched a path from 
north-west to south.

It was a brilliant sheet and 
appeared from nowhere. It lasted 
perhaps for a fraction of a 
minute, while with a zenith large 
to travel. It was said "I have 
seen many meteors in my time, 
and this object that was possible 
meteor was quite different, and 
falling at a terrific speed."

Fed 20, 1962 GLENN FLIGHT
NO CASE, INFORMATION

RECENT NEWS STORIES

COLONEL GLENN SIGHTS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS WHILE IN ORBIT:

On his history-making flight through space last February 20th, Col. John Glenn saw a great number of small glowing objects which have been described loosely as "fireflies."

At the first light of morning - the first surprise I came to, I was still facing back toward the direction which I had come from with normal orbital attitude, and just as the first rays of the sun came over onto the capsule, I glanced back inside to check something, and when I glanced back out, my initial reaction was that I was looking into a star field. These little things that I thought (at first) to be stars were actually a bright bluish green, about the size and intensity of a firefly on a really dark night. These little particles were about 6 to 10 feet apart, and there were literally thousands of them. As far as I could look off to each side I could see them, and I could also see them back along the path. Later on I turned around and I was facing the direction from which they appeared to be coming; and although, in that direction, toward the bright sunlight of the dawn coast of them I passed, you still could see a few of these coming toward the capsule. I was very much intrigued. Through the field of view I had, which was a velocity through the field was some 5 to 5 miles per hour. The particles did not seem to be maintaining from the capsule. They appeared to be in a sort of 3½ to 5 minutes. They varied in size from about 1/2 inch to a few inches across. I observed them on all three orbits, for about the same length of time.

What did Glenn actually see? Several theories have been considered, but none has been proven. The "fireflies" could not literally be the same objects. Some people suggest that the objects were ice crystals which had broken up in five or six pieces and were drifting near the spacecraft. It has been suggested that Glenn saw "spots before his eyes," caused by coming into the bright dawn sunlight. Certainly, in his three years of intensive psychological, physical and mental training, Glenn was taught to distinguish between physical objects and visual illusions. The most likely theory advanced to date is that the astronaut may have seen small particles of frozen vapor from the spacecraft's cooling device on his spacecraft. Yet, even this explanation does not suffice. During a visit to the Pentagon last March, we were told that the objects, some of which were as large as an inch in size, still have not been identified.

Naturally, the crackpots have gotten into the act. A Fraternal Adamski supporter, who shall remain nameless, has issued a "press release" claiming that John Glenn's "fireflies" confirm George Adamski's assured claims made in his book "Inside the Space Ships." Published in 1955, in that book Adamski described saucer flights he made while conversing philosophically with extraterrestrial beings. Space have been proved wrong, but in one passage he did use the word "fireflies" to describe a phenomenon he alleged to witness. Certainly, however, the claim that Col. Glenn's claim to be the first American into outer space is not in any serious danger.

Another very interesting phenomenon from the Glenn flight is shown in the photo at the top of the next page. This picture, taken from the Los Angeles Times of February 22nd, bears the following caption: "Unusual Atmospheric Phenomenon, Unexplained Streak, apparently of light, appear on picture taken by John Glenn with hand-held camera in his orbital flight."

SHEFFIELD - SHEFFIELD: Last Feb., 1962, c. 14    Boy Snobs Photo
yrs. old schoolboy was taking snapshots           Of UAO Covey
with his box camera, he said, "I noticed 5 unidentified objects in the sky - about 500
ft. up. They were moving around and making no sound. I took a photo of 4 of them."
He said he can't get of the companions
aged 12 - 16. The pictures were not voluptuous for many weeks, although slightly out of focus, the photo showed five objects such with a central dome-wiring apparatus. These shots have been
the center of such controversy, but so far
they have held up. The pictures of the objects were the typical "flying saucer"
shape.

Air Ministry a 14-year-old schoolboy of
Moor Green, Mossbrough, Sheffield,
England, captured a panoramic photo of
a group of UAOs on or about 25 Febru-
ary 1962, in the presence of two other
boys, Steward Dixon and David Brown-
low. He and his friends were in the old
nursery garden in the back of his home
when they spotted the five dark objects
over the current hedges and trees. The
picture was taken with a simple Brownie
camera, shows five dark fan-shaped ob-
jects, slightly out of focus above the
trees.

Air Ministry experts examined the
photos but would not comment on them.
There questioned the boy for nearly two
hours. Alex's father said he was told he
would get an answer if he came to Lon-
don with the photo and negative but
after the meeting, officials said they
would have to make more inquiries.

The Yorkshire Trust and the Ministry
officials pulled when they saw the boy
and his box camera. They did not smile
when they saw the photograph. They
later returned to the agency, and UFOB
and Aerial Phenomena and said the
photo is not a hoax.

On the glossy picture and the nega-
tive, there are several clusters of white
or clear spots. One cluster is immedia-
ly above one of the objects.

[Most of the text in the body of the document is partially illegible due to poor image quality]

Visible legible text includes:
- "22x" (in top right area)
- "UNCLASSIFIED" (multiple times)
- DD FORM 173 (bottom of document)
- Date stamps and markings that appear to be 3 AT and 28 Z

The document appears to be a military communication form with multiple sections and classification markings. Large portions of the text are too blurry or faded to accurately transcribe.
