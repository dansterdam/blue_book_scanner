10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Object approx size of dime held at arm's length. Large fire dimishing in size and dropping burning debris. Loud explosion followed by smaller. Appeared 70°. Disappeared into horizon.

11. COMMENTS
There is insufficient evidence available for a valid conclusion. Object has all characteristics of a "bolide", however duration of 2-3 min rules this out. Case listed as insufficient data. There were three fragments of 1960 Epsilon that centered during the latter part of Sept or first part of October. It is possible that this observation was a reentry of one of these satellites. No color or description given.
