TWO JET AIRLINERS
ENCOUNTER UFO FLYING
DISC

AF Admits Flood of Reports

BULLETIN. The Federal Aviation
Agency has just confirmed to NICAP
the sighting of a large, round flying
object by two jet-airliner crews. Encountered over the Pacific, Sept. 21,
the mysterious device, swiftly outdistanced the Boeing 707's.

Reports were radioed to FAA towers
at Wake and Honolulu by Capt. R.F.
Griffin, commanding a British Overseas
Airways Corporation plane, and by an
American Airways captain. Details
indicating a space machine much larger
than any now possible on earth were
relayed to AF intelligence.

Capt. Griffin, in a press statement, AF
HQ admitted being flooded
with reports of "flying objects" near
Wake Island.

Capt. Griffin said the BOAC jet was
at 31,000 feet in a gray, pre-dawn sky,
when the UFO appeared.

"Suddenly we saw this bright ring in
the sky, about 50 degrees up." The
British pilot described the object as
round, with sharply defined edges and
a "very clear hole" in the center. "It
was traveling in our direction but at far
greater speed. There appeared to be
reflected light coming down from it. The
object went over the horizon in seven
minutes."

The confirming Pan-American report
also was logged at Honolulu. The FAA
has sent for both reports, to be released to NICAP if there are no official
objections.

Based on first reports, these points
seem evident:

1. The object was not an ICBM missile. Not was it a satellite re-entering
the atmosphere. These appear only as
small balls of fire, briefly visible.

2. The reflected light was from the
sun, which was an hour below the horizon. The UFO had to be very high to
catch its rays.

3. At such a high altitude, the unknown device had to be extremely large
(at least several hundred feet in diameter) for its edges and hole to be
so clearly seen by the BOAC crew.
These and description rule out all
type balloons, satellites or Echo-

The "doughnut" shape the jet crews
reported is similar to the future spacecraft base proposed by rocket expert Werner
von Braunâ€”a huge doughnut-shaped ring
containing living quarters, power plant,
equipment and rotating to create gravity.

At a distance, the connecting framework would be invisible, and from far
below the space-base would appear just
as a bright ring with a hole in center.

More advanced space engineers, experiencing on another planet, could have
evolved the same type of space-base.
It is possible that what the jet crews
saw was such a spacecraft from another
world.

Here is the text from the document:

tembar three pilots spotted a doughnut-shaped UFO at high altitude between Japan and Midway Island. The object looked like a "large smoke ring," and the sky could be seen through the center of it.
