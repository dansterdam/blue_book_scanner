TWO JET AIRLINERS ENCOUNTERING FLYING DISC
The Pan-American report confirms that on the at 2916Z AZT apparently two jet airliners encountered an Unidentified Flying Object.
The Federal Aviation Agency has just confirmed to NICAP the sighting of a strange lighted UFO by TWA and United Air Lines pilots. According to the first reports, these pilots reported that the object was not an ICBM missile. Nor was it a satellite reenterIng the atmosphere. The object was clearly visible, brightly lighted and maneuvering at a high altitude. The un- known device swiftly outdistanced their planes, the pilots reported.
The Associated Press said the BOAC jet was also a witness to the strange pre-dawn sighting.
"Suddenly, we saw this bright ring in the sky," said the co-pilot, Barney Hiller. "It was a perfect circle, a very clear hole in the center. It was traveling so fast that it was on one side of the horizon and then on the other in seven minutes."

This page does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a typed document from the Department of the Air Force discussing an unidentified flying object that was observed at 1700Z. The document describes the object as appearing as a large circular area of high intensity light with a dark center, similar to an eclipse. It also mentions the object traveling east at orbital speed, leaving a faint glow of light trail, and being sighted by aircraft at the time. The document concludes with a note about advising CIN and OOP-OP at 1605L on 21/19/12 SEP RUHRPH.

The text reads:

"Ten miles or so to the south, a doughnut-shaped UFO at high altitude appeared. The object looked like a large white smoke ring, and the glow could be seen for some minutes."
