11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS

Object at 1 PL local. However, on his 117 he reported it as 3 PM local. Confidential report that he had sighted an object came from 325, went directly overhead, however, then went straight to one of 8 sight lines, was photographed in the NNW. In his 117 the observer indicated that the object traveled from NE to the SW.

The observer sighted an photographed a dark object. The object reportedly dropped some material that was forwarded for analysis. The physical analysis showed it was of a pumice-like glass and was certainly not of extraterrestrial origin. The photo closely resembles a flight aid showing a statement made by observer conflict.

To: Dr. J. Allen Hynek       From: Arthur L. Howland
Dept: Astronomy              Dept: Geology

The sample sent to you as an unidentified
flying object is a pumice-like glass. It has an
index of refraction of about 1.51. There are a
few angular quartz grains loose in some of the
cavities.

The sample closely resembles a manufactured
product that has been marketed as a sanding block
for preparing wood surfaces. It also has the same
H2S smell released by crushing that characterizes
the sanding blocks. I do not have any of the
commercial material at hand for comparison of index
and refraction and diffractogram patterns, but it
seems probable that your sample is a fragment of
the same material.

I am returning the sample herewith.

Weather Balloon
Causes UFO Reports
LOGAN, O. - The sun's reflection off a weather balloon caused a flurry of UFO reports in this southwestern area of Ohio Thursday evening, hundreds of calls were received by sheriff's offices in Hocking, Pickaway, Fairfield, Perry and Meigs counties.

A Hocking county deputy sheriff who observed the object with high-powered binoculars said it appeared to be a clear plastic weather balloon about 12 feet in diameter and floating at a high altitude.

Gentlemen:

We have had some recent U. incidents in this area. Conforming to clippings from our newspaper relating these sightings.

It was one of those quiet days in Grafton. The mercury had climbed to a stifling 95 degrees. Many area residents were seeking relief from the heat under their own back yard swimming pools, or other favorite spots.

Weary shoppers sought refuge in the cool, air-conditioned stores. Suddenly, the unexpected happened. Fenton Harman floated through the town and reportedly had sighted a UFO - unidentified flying object.

This mysterious object was spotted as seen near the Cota Country Club Road.

The "thing" was first spotted by a worker at the plant. Herbert Ethel, was said, "It looked like a large piece of metal. I watched it for awhile then went back to work. When I looked again it had moved from its position."

Ethel, in searching the object, said it was strange, shaped bright silver or clear plastic and it was as high as an airplane.

Fred Adams, an employee of Harman Brothers, said, "It looked like it had a dome on top of it, and appeared to be half as large as a large airplane, and it looked like a bird."

Both men have stated that at the time there were any more local City Police officers were called but stated that they knew nothing about it.

It is not known just how many persons in the area saw the UFO, but it is known that several men and women did see something.

Cpt. H. L. Curley of the Grafton State Police said that he was at the scene and looked at the sides of U.S. Route 119, North, who said that she spotted a "mysterious looking" object in the sky.

Cpt. Curley said that he traveled but could find nothing.

From time to time in Taylor County & LPG has been spotted. Two French Cities have been a frequent scene of flying metal that was so hot it burned a hole in a carpet after it landed in their home. Yesterday UFO was again spotted.

When was spotted some time not only in Taylor County but in other surrounding states, people were hesitant to talk about what they had seen.

"Things from outer space" have caused inquirer among many persons.

Telephone calls have been made and the story is there was something thinking through Taylor County.

Perhaps all be summed up by Ethel's statement, "Well, it was something."

Gentlemen:

Last July 20, at about 10:00 a.m. EDT, my wife and I viewed a formation of jet aircraft Interstate 64. At the time we weren't billowed was the object was Interstate 64 later I learned the bergs are positive what the object was traveling down the middle.

Because I investigate UFO sightings on occasion and am intrigued with conventional aerial objects and tool observations, descriptive illustrations of targets would prove valuable in these investigations. I understand this would help me. I am especially you might be able to send these illustrations to me.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

DART TARGET, TYPE K-11

Size: 6' x 16'
Radar Reflective
Part Number
Spec. UTC 4040

Color
Aluminum

The K-11 dart target is 6 feet wide at the rear and 16 feet long. Its wings are constructed of aluminum material which is bonded to an aluminum foil skin. An X-band corner radar reflector is mounted at the fore part of the target, with angular fairings extending forward for streamlining.

The K-11 dart target comes in kit form. Each kit is furnished to provide 10 flights, and includes wings, 2 radar reflectors, 24 nose sections and angles, kit for repairing damaged wings, and all the necessary hardware. All instructions for assembly, balancing, and repairing the K-11 target are included in the kit.

The operational use of the K-11 dart target is the same as the MK-1 target. Its larger size makes it much easier to see, track, and hit than the smaller MK-1. It will always many times more gun or cannon fire than the MK-1 and still fly in a stable manner. When lowered by parachute, the K-11 target is usually reusable, notwithstanding gun or cannon fire damage.

DART TARGET, TYPE K-12

Size: 5' x 20'
Radar Reflective
Part Number
Spec. UTC 4140

Color
Aluminum

The K-12 dart target is similar to the K-11 target, except that it is longer, being 5 feet wide and 20 feet long. When preparing it for use, the same procedures are used as for the K-11.

Operational use of the type K-12 is the same as the K-11 dart target, except that it is easier to see, track, and hit because of its larger size. It also employs an X-band corner radar reflector mounted at the fore part of the target.

Balloon Drops In On Ohio Farmer

PORTSMOUTH, O. — (AP) — Corn farmer George L. Davis has a huge plastic balloon belonging to the French government—a balloon that appears to have been orbiting the Earth at extremely high altitudes since May of this year.

The hydrogen-filled, cylinder-shaped bag dropped on Davis' cornfield in the Scioto river bottom three miles north of here yesterday morning, where it covered an acre of Davis' cornfield and when fully inflated it might have been about 650 feet in length.

Davis said the balloon carried a card with the date of May 7, 1968, and the words "National Center of Space Vehicle Launching Center." There was also a warning on the balloon that if was not dated with hydrogen and could be dangerous.

Davis speculated that originally the balloon had carried instruments which would have been retrieved by parachute. A stray wind with a metal ring attached hung from the balloon as it collapsed over the cornfield.

Weather bureau officials told Scioto county authorities that the balloon apparently had drifted over the past few days which would have blown it directly to this country from France. Davis has not decided what he'll do with the balloon. His cornfield was damaged by the plastic bag.

Latins Seeing Saucers, And Not in Their Cups

BUENOS AIRES — (UPI) — If there really are flying saucers, they don't reenter themselves to the northern hemisphere.

From Mexico to the freezing Antarctic, "objects sometimes deficiently (OVNI) — unidentified flying objects — have been reported along with eyewitness accounts of strange beings, some of whom can even write in Spanish.

REPORTS of flying saucers and saucer-related events have touched off investigations of all kinds in Bolivia, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, Chile and other countries where a mass sighting epidemic has been under way since June.

So many sightings have been reported that Argentine Adm. Benigne Varela recently said the Navy would undertake a "statistical study of serious sightings."

The navy has not been famous from the strange visitors. Varela said that Argentinian marine, English and Chilean authorities have been "five nights in total darkness" when asked about sightings.

GABRIEL, Adm. Caseres, director of the Cosmic Radiation Center at the University of Chile, thinks that even the (OVNI) is a bit strange.

Residents like Miguel Plata and whatever they are, claimed 13 of them from one observatory perched in Little Hill mountain in the Chilean Andes.

Plata said he saw them from Rio de Janeiro, an official source reported this week, being attributed to mysterious causes like "visitors from unknown."

ONE OF the top sightseers, Miguel Vieira, was reported to have shot down a flying saucer two years ago. The pattern of such incidents follows a dozen witnesses said they saw a saucer and a glowing object above the ground shortly before the occurrence's deaths.

In Argentina, the mysterious intruders are not seen as friendly. "They're always very well armed," said Capt. Carlos Pertierra, a farmer in the vicinity of Mar Del Plata.

He claimed that he was visited briefly last month by a "metallic flying object" which follows in high-sitting green suits that had a weird glow.

"When one of them raised his arm, I became dizzy," Pertierra said, describing when they lowered their arms. "I felt all right again."

Dear Mr. Citron:

I am enclosing a copy of a report of the sighting of an unidenti-
fied object that I observed during this past summer.

This report was made the day after the sighting and I sent it in
to Sky & Telescope. They replied later saying that they had no def-
inite idea what this could have been.

At that time I was unaware of your interest in this kind of
thing, so I am sending this in the hope that you will perhaps find
this of some use to you. Since then my attention was drawn to an
article in Scientific American of November 1968 entitled "Artificial
Plasma Clouds in Space", beginning on page 80. I am enclosing a copy
of part of this where they say that there could be a visible at great
distances, and of course I believe this is a possible explanation of
what I saw.

Incidentally the friend with whom I was observing that night
saw what he thinks is the same object, or the same type of object,
about three weeks later, but it was moving then from north to south.
I was not with him then.

Naturally I am very curious as to what this object might have
been, and would appreciate it if you have the time, receiving your
comments.

Very sincerely,

REPORT OF SIGHTING OF STRANGE MOVING OBJECT IN SKY, JULY 22, 1968

TIME: Sighted at approximately 1:50 PM CDT - 2 minutes

LOCATION OF OBSERVER: Laredo, Texas, 27° 30' N., 99° 30' W.

SKY CONDITION: Clear

SEEING CONDITION: To the south, limiting magnitude about 4 to 4½ over city lights. To the north, somewhat better, limiting magnitude possibly 5.

For about 2 hours before sighting this object, I had been observing in company with a friend, in his backyard telescope from any direct ground lights, watching the sky with the naked eye and binoculars and making occasional observations with his six-inch Newtonian telescope. We usually make courses as comfortable as possible on these occasions and had two cots on which we would lie when not occupied at the telescope. It was while I was lying on a cot looking skyward and my friend, unfortunately, was occupied at the telescope that my attention was taken by a most unusual object, a description of which follows:

APPEARANCE: It seemed to be a self-luminous gaseous cloud with a central condensation. In color, it was much the same as the light seen in a small telescope of extra-galactic nebulae, having the cold bluish evanescent quality of these objects.

MOTION: It was in motion when I first glimpsed it; the point when I first observed was in the area between Lyra, Scorpi, and the southern boundary of Ophiuchus. It was moving toward the west rapidly.

FURTHER NOTES ON GENERAL APPEARANCE: To the naked eye it had the appearance of a weakly glowing diffuse ball or disc, seemingly of gaseous matter. The estimated visual magnitude was about 3 to 3½ overall. When my first assessment at this sighting subsided, and this was very quick, I grabbed for the binoculars (7x50 Zeiss) lying at my side and trained them on the object, still in apparent uniform motion across the sky. In the glass I could make out no structure, but I confirmed the naked eye observation of a central condensation suggestive of a nucleus.

In size, I estimate that it subtended an arc of about 10 to 15 minutes. The entire sighting lasted no more than 5 seconds, and as it faded from view, I got the distinct impression of a foreshortening, seeming to indicate its shape as more like than spherical. It was not sharply outlined against the sky background, but the outer parts of its definition seemed to fade into the background as if the outer parts were much more tenuous than the main part.

During the few seconds of observation, not over 5, it moved about 30° of arc when it was lost to view, with uniform motion not seeming to accelerate or slow down in any way and moving in a straight course toward the west.

The central condensation did not appear much more brilliant than the overall brightness, that is to say there was no appearance of a glowing bright chest or star-like illumination in its center, but it seemed only to be denser in this central area and no hint of structure or detail.

Here is the text from the document:

If you will imagine a photograph of a nearly spherical nebulae, project this against the sky so it occupies about 10 to 15 minutes of arc, but only a hint of structure you will have a pretty good idea of what this thing looked like. Add to that this special quality of the light seen when viewing these objects and you will be pretty close to it.

DISTANCE OF OBJECT: Here I am pretty much at a loss. From the rapid motion and the foreshortening as it moved away I would have to guess it wasn't very far away, as things go astronomically, but perhaps something within a matter of up to a few hundred miles, maybe more, but definitely I would think not too far out. And very possibly much closer than this.

SPECULATION: Naturally I was quite excited at this unexpected observation of an object that I had never observed now. To the best of knowledge, has never been reported by an observer, and I have tried to determine what it wasn't.

Before going into this, I may say that I have been an amateur observer of the heavens for over 20 years. I have 6-inch, 8-inch telescopes. I know and would recognize the appearance of moving airplanes, artificial satellites, birds, insects, and what have you. I know the appearance of planets, nebulae, galaxies, clusters, double and multiple stars, and all of these things that are so dear to the amateur astronomer.

Therefore I would eliminate all of these. A bird (and I have seen them too at night) just isn't shaped like that. With the same focus for insects, but let's say, aside from this consideration, that I could have/BREAK of these things. I had would have to be pretty dogmatic because I know as a fact as this did, and I would certainly have made out his shape in the glasses. Secondly, a bird would have to be illuminated by lights below and these lights would cast some sort of modeling, and there was none. As for insects (and I've been fooled by them before), it didn't look like an insect for a starter, and an insect to show this size would have to be quite close. My conclusions had been focused for infinity. When I raised them to this object, it was in perfect focus, not likely to result if it had been a close-up image.

I eliminate meteors mainly because this didn't behave like a meteor or appear at all like a meteor. The same for an artificial satellite breaking up (unless it could have been ECHO, but would it appear like this?). I eliminate nebulae and extra-galactic objects because this seemed strikingly impossible. But if it was a comet, which doesn't seem likely, it could have been a tailless comet. It would have been something like a nebula. It could have been a tailless comet, but if it was could a comet have this behavior? Doesn't look much else except an unknown and heretofore unwrapped type of astronomical object.

Because of my skepticism, I have left this for the last, and that is UFO's, and I hesitate to call it that. In the sense that it was something I'll grudgingly call a sighting of UFO's that I've read about. No flashing lights, etc. Could it be marsh gas, as some say? I suppose so, but I wouldn't know what marsh gas looks like, and understand that I am speaking from a great lack of knowledge.

MOVEMENT OF ARTIFICIAL CLOUDS is shown for a period of 1,500 seconds or about 17 minutes. At this point has just been rejected from a rocket. Ten seconds later (2 feet) it is in an arc position phase. About 100 seconds after the starting time it was

coupling to the neutral atmosphere be fairly weak, that is, that the frequency of creation of the barium ions be rather high compared with their frequency of collision with the neutral particles of the atmosphere. At a height of 120 miles the ratio of the two frequencies is about 100 to one, at 175 miles it is about 500 to one. Here is another reason for continuing most of our experiments in this range of altitudes. For the study of atmospheric effects it is not economical to extend the cloud's at higher levels, the ions are no longer supported by the topside of the cloud, so the study of magnetic force to levels below 200 miles will be more meaningful. The height gained by launching a bigger rocket is therefore of little value.

On the other hand, certain important effects can be obtained only if the particles are high enough to travel for several minutes without colliding. In April 1966, we were able to carry out two experiments at an altitude of 1,200 miles using French rockets launched from a site in the Sahara Desert. The two experiments showed that the barium cloud has just been rejected from a rocket. Ten seconds later (2 feet) it is in an arc position phase. About 50 grams of barium was marked at the lines of force of the earth's magnetic field over a length of 1,200 miles. They were observed from the middle of Africa to central Germany.

Five months later we released a cloud some 570 miles above the East Coast of the U.S. The ion cloud could be watched for about 50 minutes at a standard along the lines of magnetic force while falling into the lower atmosphere. Texas, visible as far away as North Dakota.

Our group has now conducted enough field work to make it possible to attack a few of the more general problems that can be approached through an analysis of the electric field in the magnetosphere. One such problem concerns the relationship of the worldwide magnetic current system for the (Distortion on opposite page) field. This electric current, which is strongest on the earth's night hemisphere, consists of two very intense currents meeting at the geomagnetic equator. There, the reason suggested with the horizontal direction of the magnetic

diurnal clouds are evident. The spherical neutral cloud, consisting of minimum particles, i.e., mostly in the wind, the outward cloud responsible mainly to the shorter field. Streamers of cloud region show large separation of cloud due to respective drift motions.

Field, the conductivity is high and the current is strong. These patterns of flow have been derived from the continuous recordings made by magnetic observatories throughout the world. Many features of the current were well known long before the era of space research, among its outstanding students have been Sabine, Chapman of British, Birkeland of Norway, Kristian Birkeland at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Oslo, and John Bartels of Germany.

As early as 1882 the British physicist Balfour Stewart suggested that electric currents in the upper atmosphere could be generated by the motion of the earth's atmosphere across the magnetic field. The situation is analogous to the dynamo effect in a type of electric generator where an electric current is generated when conducting air moves through a magnetic field. These early ideas of electric currents were small due to an electric circuit consisting of an air-earth electric potential difference. There was even a small difference between the electric field in both parts of the diurnal

to the external resistance, they are point-
ing in the same direction, whereas radial
lines drawn through the center show the
dynamo they are opposite to each
other.

Observation of the motions of the arti-
ficial plasma clouds has revealed the
existence of such electric fields in the
magnetosphere. They showed also that
the twilight zone as middle magnetic
latitudes the direction of the electric
fields corresponds to the situation inside
a dynamo. The clouds have therefore
provided what is apparently the first de-
tailed experimental verification of the
Stewart hypothesis. The observed elec-
tric fields have a strength of between
one and three volts per kilometer at
middle magnetic latitudes.

Another interesting feature of the
human-cloud experiments is the appear-
ance in the clouds of striations aligned
with the magnetic fields. The striations
range in width from a half-mile to about
six miles. They seem to indicate that the
density distribution of the ionized mat-
ter in the ionosphere (and probably also
in the higher magnetosphere) is not
smooth but rather like a bundle of fibers.
The fibers are not constant in space but
change within a few minutes. The mech-
anisms of their generation and decay
are not well understood.

A fascinating region for experiments
with ion clouds is the zone where
auroras are regularly observed. In the
auroral zone the magnetic lines of force
that are linked to the distant part of the
magnetosphere (particularly to the tail
region) meet the surface of the earth.
The motions set up in the outer mag-
netosphere by interactions with the so-
lar wind are transferred by means of
electric fields to lower altitudes.

For periods of a few hours strong cur-
rents can flow in the ionosphere. The
maximum current, called the polar elec-
trojet, flows westward along the track
in which most auroras are seen.
Such currents are normally accompanied
by auroral displays.

Since inside an aurora the density of
ionization is higher than it is outside,
the conductivity is also enhanced in that
region. The maximum conductivity is
normally located at an altitude of about
65 miles, which is the region of strong
Hall current, known as the Hall cur-
rent consists of electrons, it is regarded
as being positive in a direction oppo-
site to the flow of electrons. In other words,
a Hall current measured in moving west-
ward consists of electrons drifting east-
ward.

At higher altitudes electrons and pos-
itive ions drift with the same velocity.

CURRENT SYSTEM in the ionosphere was plotted on the basis of magnetic perturbation
recorded on the ground. The electric currents shown are in the south side of the earth. U.
highest current density at the geomagnetic equator is called the equatorial electrojet.

PATHS OF CLOUDS released over Sweden on five days in April, 1965, are placed. 11
clouds were released at the homeplare near Kiruna in the late evening or early morning
the data shown. The consecutive days on each path represent intervals of 10 minutes.

THURSDAY, JULY 24, 1968

The rest of the text is too illegible to read clearly. The image appears to be a document with multiple sections, including what looks like a weather or topographical map with contour lines and annotations of "HIGH" and "LOW" in various areas.


- page 73 -

The image appears to be a meteorological or topographical map with contour lines and labels of "HIGH" and "LOW" at various points. The map is divided into two sections, with the top section showing a less detailed representation and the bottom section showing more intricate contour lines. The map seems to be related to atmospheric or geographical data, with curved lines indicating pressure systems or terrain elevation. Some additional markings and notations are present, but they are not clearly legible in this black and white scanned document.

THE MAPS                JULY 22-28, 1968

This Southampton Weather Station provides a daily log of the surface weather observations and the tracks of cyclones and anticyclones. The map shows the surface weather charts for 500 millibars or about 18,000 feet above sea level. The preceding maps are small scale and areas of cross-hatching indicate a fraction of those that included in the operational weather maps. Occasionally the weather reports that are plotted show a fraction of those that could be included in the operational charts. This happens when the data cannot be included in the published maps. The 500 millibar chart contains the height contours and isotherm lines at 7:00 a.m. est. The height contours are on the continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are dashed lines.

WEEKLY SERIES

The charts in this publication are a station data and sea level map at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of cyclones
and fronts are shown by solid and broken lines, arrows, and other symbols. Isobars are shown in heavy lines
proceeding map units as indicated in the legend. Closed isobars indicate high and low pressure centers. Areas
of precipitation are cross-hatched. Areas of clear sky are white.

The Surface Weather Map presents
a compilation of meteorological
data from the U.S. Weather Bureau Synoptic Station Network. The
500 Millibar Chart depicts the
general circulation of the atmosphere as analyzed from upper air
observations. Isobars on this chart
are drawn at 60 meter intervals
and are labeled in tens of feet
above sea level. The isobars are

shown at sea level and at 7:00
a.m. e.s.t. This track of cyclones
and fronts are shown by solid and
broken lines, arrows, and other
symbols. Closed isobars indicate
high and low pressure centers.
Areas of precipitation are crosshatched. Areas of clear sky are
white. The chart is a fractional
representation of those that are
the operational weather map
which the analysis are typical of
the printed station climatological
data. The 500 Millibar Chart is
a tight contour chart showing the
500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m.
e.s.t.
