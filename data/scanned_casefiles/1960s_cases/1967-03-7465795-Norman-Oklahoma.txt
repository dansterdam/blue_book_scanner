ENGINEERING DIVISION, COMMENTS - WEATHER BALLOON LAUNCHED
FROM TINKER AFB IS MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF REPORTED SIGHTING.
LOW LEVEL WINDS FROM THE SOUTHEAST AND SHIFTING TO THE SOUTH-
WEST AT 6000 FT ALTITUDE WOULD CAUSE BALLOON TO DRIFT FROM
EAST TO WEST DURING PERIOD OF SIGHTING. MOON WAS BRIGHT
WHICH WOULD CAUSE REFLECTION FROM THE BALLOON. DISAPPEARANCE
OF OBJECT PROBABLY CAUSED BY BALLOON GOING INTO SCATTERED
CLOUDS AT 7000 FT. NO BRIGHT STARS OR PLANETS WERE VISIBLE
IN THIS AREA NEAR THE REPORTED ELEVATION OF THE OBJECT.

TINKER AFB CONTROL TOWER REPORTED NO OBJECTS VISIBLE AT
THIS TIME. REPORTING WITNESSES WHO GAVE NAMES WERE ALL COLLEGE
STUDENTS LIVING IN ONE APARTMENT HOUSE. ONE NORMAN POLICE
OFFICER TOLD HIS DESK SERGEANT HE SAW THE OBJECT BUT WOULD
NOT TALK ABOUT IT. ONE REPORTING WITNESS, MR. [REDACTED],
