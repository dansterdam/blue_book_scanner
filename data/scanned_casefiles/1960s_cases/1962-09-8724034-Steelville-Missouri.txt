Steelville, Missouri
September 14, 1962

Dear Mr. President:

It is very hard for me to write a great man like you because I can't spell very good. I am a green country woman. But I am going to try to do my best to tell you about objects that are landing in our world. My husband and I were riding along West on Highway 8. I shot two of them come down on top of trees next to the highway. The objects stopped on top of that tree. My husband and I got out of our car to look at the objects. The objects then started moving away from us. The objects looked light. I saw when they go back up in the sky only brighter. When the objects were on top of the trees they looked like a big balloon all lighted up. People have told me tell have seen the objects landing in to the south and the earth from here.

There is one large Object landing, now - my husband and I from the land. Where the Object is landing is on Highway 8 West, 8 miles from Steelville, Missouri. In the woods. When the big Object is landing we had trouble with the T.V. our picture goes off and some funny sound like some kind of buzzing sound. This is the picture I have picked up on T.V. when the Object is landing.

The Object moves from out of the South to the West and lands. We can see the Object from our home. At 20 minutes before 8 o'clock at night it landed. Please Mr. President if you don't know what this Object is. Please send somebody out here that would find out what it is.

And don't write me.
Because I don't want my
husband to know I write to you.
But if the Object doesn't
belong to us and you want
us to help find it, we'll-help.
When it is Cloudy the Object does
not land.

Mrs.
Steelville, Missouri
