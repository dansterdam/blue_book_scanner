VICTOR W. KILLICK
1857 - 4TH AVENUE
SACRAMENTO, CALIF. 95819
Phone 442-5227.                                                Sept. 9, 1964.

To the
Commanding Officer,
Hather Air Force Base,
Mather Field, Sacramento, Calif.

Dear Sir:

During the last 12 years the writer has had charge of the Astronomical Observatory of Sacramento City College. In the course of our operations I receive telephone calls and letters from civilians, government officials and the military seeking identification of sky objects they report having seen.

Most of the reported sightings concern astronomical objects, night flying planes, search lights etc. As yet, I have never had a hoax reported.

Last Saturday afternoon a woman, unknown to me, phoned my residence saying she had been near Rancho Cordova Union. She stated that her son-in-law had seen some strange lights in the sky the previous night while on a hunting trip in the mountains and wanted to know if any one else had made a report on it.

I replied that we had a report of a brilliant meteor having passed over Los Angeles and which was exploded in the Sierra east of Via las, but that event had occurred on Thursday night.

I questioned her for details on what her son-in-law had seen and she called him to the phone.

He told me that on Friday night Sept. 5th., he and two companions went out for a deer hunt near town and arrows into the region of the Look Laven lakes, ( Tp. 16 N. - R. 13 E.) in the vicinity south of Cisco, off Hiway 40. During the late afternoon they separated to hunt. As darkness approached he realized he was lost and rather than risk trying to find his way back to their camp in the dark over rough terrain he decided at would be safer to stay where he was until dawn. (This part of the story checks, as there was no moon that night.)

He says he found a tree in a protected location, climbed into it and fastened himself to one of its branches with his belt. Soon he noticed a glowing light moving and hovering along a nearby ridge. He describes it as moving laterally and vertically, over and beyond the ridge. It made no sound. It came closer and at an estimated distance of 1/2 mile some sort of vehicles appeared to land on the ridge.

Shortly thereafter he heard a crackling or some one approaching through the nearby shrubbery. Two human beings, about 30 feet tall, dressed in white came and stood near his tree at a distance of about 150 yards. They did not speak. Interested a going sound resembling the sound of a dove. Later, two other moving robot-like moving objects appeared. These emitted a noxious gas with an odor to gag and choke him. He sent three arrows at them, one of which hit a robot with a metallic sound and was recovered later. On Friday, Sept. 5th, at a place to recess witnesses he carried and dropped them to the ground in an effort to start a small grass fire. This would attract the forest service. Thus caused the visitors to leave him unharmed.

I ascertained he is a married man, 26 years old, employed at aero-jet plant here. His brother also employed at the same plant. He is relating party applied for a fire permit at the nearby ranger station. He stated no story was to be believed and that he did not want to let it get out in the newspapers, and did not

want to reveal his name, which I did not press him to do, but I did get him to give me his mother-in-law's telephone number. he said he thought it was his duty to notify someone in authority to have the matter investigated, I as a public security matter).

On Sept. 6th. I received another telephone call from the wife of the man. They made an appointment to meet me at my home and appeared shortly after 1:P.M. together with his brother. They brought along a Coast service map, pin-pointed the location the episode and also the arrow in question with a dented point.

I told them that the Air Force may want to investigate the incident; that I was skeptical myself, but would like to assist in helping them get to the bottom of it. They said they would welcome and give assistance to such an investigation, provided no-publicity was attained to it.

As far as my contact with them, goes, these people all appear in good health and rational. The family relates the man's story. They told me that when he got home he was "as pale as a sheet", and hardly shaken up. I did a little probing to try and find an ulterior motive without success. I have a certain degree of confidence in their veracity and sincerity.

If you desire to have the matter investigated I think I can arrange for a private meeting with the principal and his family and your investigators.

Yours very truly,

Victor W. Killick

1. Reference your message, 5200P-1 9-271, 25 Sep 64, pertaining
to an unidentified flying object reported by Mr [name illegible]

2. Request tape recording and other materials received in conjunc-
tion with the referenced UFO report be forwarded to this office.

3. Request the following questions be asked of the investigating
officers, Capt McCloud and SMSgt R Barnes:

    a. Did the interviewing Officers feel that this occurrence could
    have been attributed to an owl or other such birds or animals, coupled
    with an overactive imagination on the part of the witness?

    b. Witness stated that lights noticed were believed to be a
    helicopter looking for him. Was the reason for this statement ascer-
    tained?

    c. Regarding the loud crashing in the brush. What was the
    closest approach of the two human like figures that were crashing
    through the brush? Were the objects which reacted to the fire the
    same as those which crashed through the brush?

    d. What form did the violent reaction take when fire was thrown?
    Were the objects on the ground when fire was thrown at them?

    e. What form of harassment caused the witness to climb higher
    into the trees?

    f. Reference is made to a moveable UFO figure with a light.
    Was this described in detail?

PAGE 3 RUWHSBA 2 UNCLAS
BELIEVING THEM TO BE A HI COPTER LOOKING FOR HIM, M, LIGHTED
THREE SIGNAL FIRES ON THE RIDGE OVERLOOKING GRANITE CREEK VALLEY.
THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE THREE SILVERY OBJECTS THAT WERE ATTRACTED
TO THE LOCALITY OF MR DROPPING TWO UNKNOWN OBJECTS IN THEIR
DESCENT AND CIRCLING HIS POSITION, WITHIN A FEW MINUTES HE HEARD
LOUD CRASHING IN THE UNDERBRUSH BELOW HIS POSITION AND SINCE IT
WAS TRAVELING IN HIS DIRECTION, HE TOOK SANCTUARY IN THE LOWER
BRANCHES OF A TALL PINE TREE. HE THEREUPN WITNESSED TWO HUMAN-LIKE
INDIVIDUALS APPROACHING HIS POSITION AND THAT OF THE SIGNAL FIRES.
THEY WERE GARBED IN A SILVER-LIKE SUIT BUT USUALLY HAD THE COMPLETE
ABSENCE OF A NECK. THESE STRANGE INDIVS HAD UNUSUAL FACIAL FEATURES
ESPECIALLY IN THE REGION OF THE EYES THAT PROTRUDED EXTENSIVELY.
MR BELIEVES THAT HE WAS NOTICED BY THESE INDIVS AND THAT
THEY TRIED TO DISLODGE HIM FROM HIS TREE POSITION, AND THAT A THIRD
"ALIEN" INDIV DIFFERING FROM THE TWO PREVIOUS TYPES APPEARED ON
THE SCENE. THIS INDIV IS REFERRED TO BY MR AS A "ROBOT"
(FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION) AND THAT HE FIRED SOME ARROWS
AT THE ROBOT BUT FAILED TO DISRACT OR DIVERT ANY OF THE UNIDENTI FIED INDIVS. HE TRIED FIRE BY LIGHTING PARTS OF HIS CLOTHING AND
THROWING IT AT THE INDIVS, TO WHICH THEY HAD VIOLENT REACTIONS.

PAGE 4 RUWHSBA 2 UNCLAS
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THE ALIEN UFOBS REACTED ALSO TO THE FIRE
BY ASCENDING UPWARDS. MR EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL REACTION TO
A VUPOR EMITTED FROM THE ROBOTS AND BLACKED OUT. HIS BOW WEDGED
INTO A CROCK IN THE LIMB OF THE TREE WHICH PREVENTED HIS FALLING
AND LATER THE CONTINUAL HARASSMENT CAUSED HIM TO CLIMB HIGHER INTO
THE TREE AND USING HIS BELT HE STRAPPED HIMSELF TO THE TREE. THE
ALIEN INDIVS COMMUNICATED TOGETHER VIA AN UNINTELLIGIBLE "COOLING
NOISE" AS WELL AS THAT COMMUNICATION VECTORED FROM THE MOVABLE
LIGHT ON THE UFOB VEHICLE. REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS AT THE EARLY
DAWN, MR DISCOVERED THE UFOB ANDIOCCUPANTS HAD DISAPPEARED.
HE REJOINED HIS HUNTING COMPANIONS AND TELLING THEM HIS STORY
RECEIVED REMARKS THAT IT PROBABLY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE
METEORIC THAT GOVERNMENT WAS LOOKING FOR. HE TOLD HIS STORY
TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW WHO PROMPTED HIM TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE
AUTHORITIES. MR CONTACTED A LOCAL USTRAMETER-INSTRUCTOR
WHO SUBSEQUENTLY NOTIFIED MATHER AFB OFFICIALS, INTELLIGENCE
OFFICERS AT MATHER AFB NOTIFIED MCCLELLAN AFB AND THE INTELLIGENCE
MEMBERS OF THE 359ABWG WG ACCOMPANIED THE INTERVIEW ABOVE.
REMARKS OF THE INTERVIEWER: MR IS A LOCAL RESIDENT AND IS
APPROX 27 YRS OF AGE, MARRIED, AND PRESENTLY EMPLOYED AT A LOCAL

PAGE 5 RUWHSBA 2 UNCLAS
MISSILE PRODUCTION PLANT. HE APPEARS STABLE AND CONSISTENT IN
TELLING HIS STORY AND BELIEVES THAT THE ABOVE OCCURRED AS
DESCRIBED, AS ACTUAL TAPE RECORDING NARRATION OF HIS ENCOUNTER
IS HELD IN THIS OFFICE AS WELL AS THE ONLY ARROW FIRED DURING
THIS ENCOUNTER AND A COPY A LETTER OF THIS UFOB NARRATED TO A
LOCAL CIVILIAN EDUCATOR AND PASSED ON TO MATHER AFB OFFICIALS IS
ALSO ON FILE IN THIS OFFICE.
