K.     UPON RECEIVING THE PHONE CALL FROM AIRMAN HUYGE AT 0S10Z,
        THE FOL ACTION WAS INITIATED BY ME IN INVESTIGATING THE
        SIGHTING: INCREASED RADAR SURVEILLANCE OVER THE AREA IN QUESTION
        BY OUR SITE AS WELL AS THE TWO ADJACENT RADAR SITES; PHONE
        CALLS TO MINOT AFB, MINOT FAA, MINNEAPOLIS ARTC, WINNIPEG ARTC,
        29AIR DIVISION. IN THE MEANTIME, OBSERVERS WERE PLACED
        OUTSIDE IN AN EFFORT TO SIGHT THE OBJECT. NO CONTACTS WERE MADE
        ON THE RADAR. NO EXPLANATION FROM ANY OF THE CENTERS TO ACCOUNT
        FOR THE OBJECT; NO OTHER REPORTS WERE RECEIVED ALTHOUGH THE
        MINOT AFB SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR STATED THAT SEVERAL CALLS WERE
        RECEIVED BY HIM CONCERNING THIS SIGHTING. WITHIN MINUTES AFTER
        THE SIGHTING WAS CALLED TO ME, I WENT OUTSIDE TO OBSERVE. THE
        NIGHT WAS VERY CLEAR AND A FULL MOON LIT THE AREA; NEVERTHELESS
T       THE ONLY OBJECT IN THE VICINITY REPORTED WAS AN UNUSUALLY
        BRIGHT STAR. NO MOVEMENT OF THE STAR WAS NOTED DURING MY OBSERVATION
        LASTING TWENT OR MORE MINUTES. NO KNOWN AIRCRAFT WERE FLYING IN OUR
        AREA AT THAT TIME.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location Minot, North Dakota

Date 9 July 60                   Hour (Z) 0607

WX Clear, vis 15 mi, winds N. & SW at 0 to 15 knots

Description Round, size of pea at arms length, flickered from white to red to blue to white, circled city in clock-wise direction, seen at 75-80 deg elev, remained in sight for 3 hours and dimmed after about two hours.

Direction of Motion circled

Satellite: (AFCIN-463, Phone 69219)   Duration excessive, and flight nat. is not that of a satellite

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) from Astro (Vega)

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-461)           None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc) ---------

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. remained in the same general area too long

Other

Evaluation of Source Reliability     less reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: Apparently a large number of people saw the object, but only the impression of one individual was reported. It is doubtful that an object remaining in the midair area of a major site could remain undetected for three hours. If it was anywhere near the earth. The object observed was probably the star Vega, a 1st magnitude star, which was in the exact location reported for the UFO. The apparent movement was probably due to warm air and foreign particles in the atmosphere.
