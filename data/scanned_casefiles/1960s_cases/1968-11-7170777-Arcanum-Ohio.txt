Dear Sirs:

This letter is in answer to your communication of November 19,1968.

I am writing to inform you that I have reported what seemed to be a UFO object the 13th of November. 

On the evening of the 13th at about 5:15 P.M. my wife and I observed low hanging clouds coming from the west. These clouds were light in color and seemed to be parting or splitting as they moved from west to east. After a few minutes we noticed what appeared to be a bright light in the center of the clouds. This light seemed to pulsate and change in intensity. This series appeared twice within a period of 10-15 minutes. After that time, approximately 6 P.M. no further sighting was made.

At about 6:17 P.M. the sky was completely clear, a bright yellow bank lifted and approximately due west. Well, it continued its steady moving course from North to East. No further clouds as was first noticed on careful observation. This had to have been the reflection of the searchlight on the heavy low hanging clouds.

Very truly yours,
[Signature]
