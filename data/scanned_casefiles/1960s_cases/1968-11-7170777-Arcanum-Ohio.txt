Dear Sirs:                                                     Att: TDPT (UFO)  11/13/68
                                                                
This letter is in answer to your communication of
November 19, 1968.

I am deeply chagrined at having reported what seemed to
be a UFO object the 13th of November.

On the night in question (about 5:55 P.M.) there were
low hanging clouds coming from the West. What appeared
to be a series of floating objects would appear moving
from Northwest to Southeast and then disappear. This
series appeared twice within two to three minutes apart,
(at which time I called Wright Patterson AFB.) After
this time, approximately 6 P.M. no further sighting was
made.

At about 6:45 P.M., still observing, the heavy cloud bank
lifted and approximately due West, but well beyond the
skyline a search light was observed moving from North to
South and casting the same brilliant cone reflection on the scattered
clouds as was first noticed. On careful observation this
had to have been the reflection of the searchlight on the
heavy low hanging clouds.

Very truly yours,

[Signature is blacked out]
