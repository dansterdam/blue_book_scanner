At 1800Z MR on this date, Note I was visible in your area over Landover Hills, Md., at 190 Gross Altitude. This was the object you sighted if your report was given in Daylight Saving Time, instead of Eastern Standard Time.

Here is the text from the document:

7/12/65

Sir,

On Sunday, June 27, at approx. 10 o'clock p.m. I saw a starlike object suddenly move steadily across a small span of sky west to east over the (Landover Hills, Md. area)

I tried to figure seconds it stopped, and I could not find it again.

I dismissed it at the time and hoped to hear a report on the news on Monday since there are many radar stations in the Washington area and if it was a foreign object it would surely be detected. So I just figured it was a star or satellite.

But later on during the week I was alerted to hear about a similar object passing over (partially illegible word) Antarctica. Could the two (partially illegible word) be the same?

Sorry I didn't notify you sooner.
