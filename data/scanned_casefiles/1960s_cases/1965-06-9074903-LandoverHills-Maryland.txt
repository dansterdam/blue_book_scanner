The text in the document is as follows:

AUG - 9 1965

Dear Mrs S

This is in reply to your letter reporting an aerial object which you observed on 6 July 1965 at 10:40 pm. The object was sighted in your skies at an elevation of 70 degrees. This is the bright planet Venus known to be quite bright in the skies at this time. Instead of being a strange sight, this is a common phenomenon which is perfectly normal in our skies. I hope this clarifies the matter for you.

Sincerely,

INFORMATION REPORT 
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Lanover Hills, Maryland, 27 Jun 65

1. DATAGRAPH (see encl)
REPORT NO: 2250
OSIGINATING OFFICE: DISTRICT OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS
MARCH AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA
DATE: 22 JUL 65

2. Description: 
On the night of 27 Jun 65, at approximately 2330 hours, a married couple observed a bright light in the sky over Lanover Hills, Maryland. The object was described as circular in shape, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and hovering about 100-150 feet off the ground. The object remained motionless for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. The couple reported the incident to the DISTRICT OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS.

3. Evaluation: The USAF evaluation of this incident is that the object observed was possibly an unidentified flying object (UFO). The speed and maneuverability of the object are consistent with the characteristics of a UFO, and the visual observations by reliable witnesses lend credence to the report. No satisfactory conventional explanation for the sighting has been determined.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Here on tuesday, june 27 at about 10:30 pm a local resident reported seeing a bright light in the sky. The light was observed steadily for about 2 or 3 minutes, then it started to move and disappeared. The witness said it moved very fast and was a very bright round or ball of light. An area a foreign object it would surely be very bright. So it just figured it was a star or satellite.

But later on during the week I was told to hear about a similar object being seen in this area. An alleged could the time be the same.

sorry it didn't get you sooner.
