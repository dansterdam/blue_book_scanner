The text on this page appears to be a repeated line of text that reads:

"SOUTH OF CITY, XX DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON MOVING SE"

Where "XX" seems to be a variable number of degrees. The text is repeated multiple times vertically down the page, with slight variations in the degree number. The text appears to be describing the movement and position of something (possibly an unidentified flying object) relative to a city, moving in a southeast (SE) direction above the horizon.

The text is somewhat faded and blurry, but mostly legible. The page appears to be from a document related to UFO observations or tracking.
