SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 24 February 1967

TO: FTD (TDSI/UFO)
     Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

In reference to your letter, subject as above, dated 22 August 1967, the following is submitted:

a. The first object was observed for a few minutes. Object number two was observed for about one hour by Sergeants Vaughn, Hansen and Airman Miller.

b. The first object was viewed on radar. The second object was outside the sweep range of the radar unit in question. Therefore it did not show on radar.

c. FTD Form 164 is designed to cover sightings of only one object. These individuals observed two objects with different characteristics. Therefore the information was conflicting.

d. Tower personnel were contacted. Air activity in the area was negative at the time the objects were sighted. Tower personnel did not observe the objects in question.

e. Sergeant Hansen was the only one that heard the sound of a jet-type engine.

f. Added information: The sightings were of flashing lights and not objects.

SUBJECT: UFO Report, Glasgow AFB, Montana

TO:     TDPT/UFO(Major Quintanilla)

1.      Reference is made to the subject UFO report(attached).

2.      Although the sighting was reported to have been observed for
two hours by radar, no description of the radar sighting is included
other than the statement that it was observed on an MG-13 Fire Control
radar. Obviously, the references to red, white, and blue lights
as big as a pea, or a nickel, are visual observations. For this
reason, there is insufficient information with which to analyze
the radar sighting.

Dear Mr. Low:

Reference my telephone conversation with Miss McKelvey concerning a radar-visual observation from Glasgow AFB, Montana. Enclosed is pertinent information on the 24 February 1967 sighting.

We had requested more information on the radar portion of the case, and the return correspondence was received unfavorably by Major Quintanilla. Possibly you, or the group, would want to follow this particular case. It definitely appears to me that two different phenomena were observed; however, some as you can see are doubtful. According to the message the duration of the visual observation was only one-two minutes while the radar sighting was in excess of that.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM F. MARLEY, Jr, 1st Lt, USAF

Reference your message Unclas BC 0026k March 1967, Subject: Report of an unidentified flying object received by this office 4 March 1967. Request clarification be made with regards to UFO sighting. If radar contact was established with an alleged UFO, was any type of intercept action taken? The message implies that two groups of personnel observed the same phenomena. From the description it is highly unlikely this to be the case.

TO: Foreign Technology Division (TDET/UFO)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

Reference your letter, subject as above, dated 2 May 1967, the following
clarification is submitted:

a. Radar contact was established with a MG 13 Fire Control System.
No interceptive action was taken due to operators of the radar system failing to notify proper authorities prior to object disappearance.

b. The message implies that the two groups of personnel observed
the same phenomena for the following reasons:
    (1) Most information is identical.
    (2) Observers in vehicle possibly only observed one object due
    to their location.
    (3) Observers in vehicle only observed phenomena for approximately two minutes. During this time period the alternating red, white
    and blue colors could have assumed the white color.
    (4) Second group may not have heard engine due to their location in building.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
[Sketch includes a truck labeled "Truck" and "BLB 966"]

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

UFO Observation, 23 February 1967

AIC Larry Miller
13th Fighter Interceptor Squadron
Glasgow AFB, Montana 59231

1. Your name has been given as a witness to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting of 23 February 1967 at Glasgow AFB, Montana.

2. They reported that you observed two different sightings on the night in question and also observed one or both on radar set. Therefore, we are attaching two AF Forms 117 for your use, one for each sighting. If you would also indicate which object was also seen on radar, when you first started to paint it and how long you painted it, we would appreciate it. This could best be included as part of a narrative on the blank pages of the form.

3. Please excuse the delay in contacting you. However, the information we are requesting is needed. We would also like you to complete the forms without consulting other witnesses, in order that we receive only your impressions of the sighting.

4. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Glasgow AFB, Montana 59231

1. Reference your unidentified flying, object (UFO) observation
of 23 February 1967. We refer to the lack of time between our last
correspondence with you and our present request, however, the
case was submitted to the radar experts and was carefully
returned.

2. Portions of your sighting are confusing; at times we find it
difficult to distinguish when object you are referring to. For
instance, even though you saw two objects, you only saw time
(9:55 pm) as to when you saw the object and only list one time
period (two hours). Therefore, we are attaching two AF Form 117 for your use. We would appreciate
your completing one form for each sighting, listing the time
duration of each sighting, on their respective form. You may find
it helpful to write a narrative of the sightings on the page provided in the form.

3. You also indicated that you saw "the object" on a radar set.
Please indicate which object it was that you sighted, when you
first started to paint it, how long it was painted, speed, direction,
and height as indicated by the radar, if available. This information
could probably be best included in your narrative.

4. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Your name has been given to the Aerial Phenomena Office (Project Blue Book) as being a witness to an unidentified flying object.

If you were a witness to an UFO sighting on 23 February 1967, would you please complete the attached AF Form 117 and return it in the envelope provided. If you were not a witness to this sighting, would you please make a statement to this effect on the attached form. The information which you provide will be used in evaluating this observation.

TDEV/UFO (Maj Quintanilla)/7916/mbs/22 Aug 67)
UFO Observation, 24 February 1967

91st Combat Support Group

Reference your unclassified message, BC 00264 March 1967, subject:
"Report of UFO." After comparing the initial report from your office
with the forms completed by the observers, several confusing and
conflicting elements arose. Before reaching our final conclusions
on this particular sighting, we need to clarify these points:

a. Which of the two objects was observed for several minutes
and which object was viewed for nearly two hours?

b. Did the radar operator actually observe any of the objects
both on radar and visually? Which object actually appeared on radar?
If there were two objects, did both appear on radar?

c. According to your message, Sergeants Vaughn and Hansen observed
an object for two minutes, yet a completed FTD Form 164 indicates their
observation was nearly two hours.

d. There was no indication whether tower personnel were contacted
and if they observed the objects. If one object was visible for nearly
two hours, we would certainly have expected the tower operator to have
viewed the object. Your message did not indicate whether records were
checked for possible air activity in the area at the time of the sighting.

e. Your report also indicates that Sergeants Vaughn and Hansen
heard a sound similar to a jet engine, yet the completed Form indicates
that Sgt. Vaughn did not hear any sound. Request this discrepancy be
clarified.
