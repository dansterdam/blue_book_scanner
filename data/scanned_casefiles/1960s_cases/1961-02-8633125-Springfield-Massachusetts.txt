PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 8 Feb 61
2. LOCATION: Springfield, Massachusetts

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1830 GMT
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. PHOTOS: No
6. SOURCE: Civilian

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2-3 sec
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1

9. COURSE: Overhead at 090°. Disappeared instantaneously high and E in a straight, non-arcing path.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Bluish-white, cylindrical object with reddish, cone-like tail. Object seemed high. No sound heard. Sighted directly overhead at 090°.

11. COMMENTS: Obj was moving E, a/c which was rept to be landing at about this time toward E. Obj was last observed B-52; no sound heard. If obj was of B-52, witness should have heard it. From of obj was rept to be bluish-white, which could have been landing lights (which were turned on) shining on haze and smoke pro-sent at time. Nevertheless, absence of sound and short duration tends to rule out possibility of obj being B-52 as this a/c can be heard when landing, especially if it passes overhead. Obj was probably very low.

12. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient Data for Evaluation
