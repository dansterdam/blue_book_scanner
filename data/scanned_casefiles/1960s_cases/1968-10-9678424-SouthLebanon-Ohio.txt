Dear Sirs, I forgot this
information in the form
you sent to be filled out.
The U.F.O.'s sometime
come over the trees and
along the tops of the
trees like this before
landing.

Sometimes they will look
like they aren't anything
up there in the sky-then
light will start blinking
the (cut) then moves as
to moves other things
in the sky "think" back
as it moves along.

he manes I have you
in culture as going to
charge so as the theater

I hope the information
I give you is complete.
The H.T.O.s were there.
They seemed to go towards
an I aid barn. The roof used
to be red. At some the glance
I got through the trees it
looks as if they painted
the roof white or clean.
Within some body who owns
that was barn knows every
thing about what barns.
I just knew who owns
the barn.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                   7 OCT 1968

South Lebanon. #5065

Mrs                called on 7 October 1968. She has been seeing UFOs
every night almost for the last year. She sees them about the
same time each night (about dark) and they seem to go over and land
on the hill behind M                 house. About a year ago Mrs
                saw a UFO that was close enough to hit with a rock and
ano her time she saw one that had green and red revolving lights
on it. The one she sees every night are white with green and red
lights. I told Mrs Sampson I'd send her a reporting form and the
next time she sees one to fill it out and return it to us.
