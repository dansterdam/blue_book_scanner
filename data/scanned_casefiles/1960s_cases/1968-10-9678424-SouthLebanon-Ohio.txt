The image does not contain a photograph, but rather shows a handwritten document page. The text in the document appears to be a report or statement related to a UFO sighting or incident.

The text in the document reads:

"Dear Sir:
I have investigated the incident which occurred on the 9th of Oct. and submit the following:
The object was sighted by two adults and three children. They were in the field west of the 'Pike' when they observed the object. It seemed to be hovering or moving slowly over the field. The object was described as being 20-30 feet in diameter and a dull gray color. It made no sound. The object was observed for about 10 minutes before disappearing rapidly 'like a shot' to the west. The witnesses state that there were two other similar objects in the sky at the same time but they disappeared before this object did. The witnesses are certain that the object was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I do not feel that I can make any definite conclusion as to the identity or origin of the object. The witnesses appear to be reliable and sincere in their statements."

- page 4 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document appears to be a report or witness account related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"It seemed to me that the object was to the east of me, going to the south at a rapid rate of speed. I forgot the illumination it gave out. I could not discern any windows or doors or protrusions of any kind. The movement was too rapid for me to get the exact shape. I have to admit that the object was traveling at an unbelievable speed, much faster than any known man-made aircraft. If this sighting is not a hoax, then I must conclude that the object was an unidentified flying machine."

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
7 OCT 1963
Mrs. called on 7 October 1963. She has been seeing UFOs almost every night for the last year. She sees them about the same time each night (about dark) and they seem to go over and on the hill behind her house. About a year ago Mrs. saw a UFO that was close enough to hit with a rock and her time she saw one that had green and red revolving lights on it. The one she sees every night are white with green and red lights. I told Mrs. Sampson I'd send her a reporting form and the next time she sees one to fill it out and return it to us.

The lower diagram depicts a landscape view, with what appears to be a human figure in the foreground against a horizon landscape.
