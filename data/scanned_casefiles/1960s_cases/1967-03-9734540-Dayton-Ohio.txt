DEAR STR:

WHEN COMING TO WORK THURSDAY MORNING, AT 5:30 I SAW WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LARGE, WHITE, GLOWING CRAFT SALEM AVE TOWARD THE DOWNTOWN AREA WHERE I WORK. I SEEN THIS AIRCRAFT CIRCLING THE DOWNTOWN AREA. AS IT APPROACHED THE RED LIGHT ON RIVERVIEW DAM IT SHOT OFF A BEAM OF LIGHT TOWARD THE CITY, WHEREAS THE RED LIGHT ON THE AIRCRAFT WENT OFF, AND A WHITE LIGHT CAME ON AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE. IT SEEMED STILL FOR A MATTER OF 2 MINUTES, THEN MOVED A LITTLE SOUTH AND STOPPED AGAIN FOR A MINUTE WITH ONLY A BRIGHT RED LIGHT ON AND MOVED AGAIN GOING EAST.

Text from the document:

MRS. QUINTANILLA,
I received a call from Mrs. [redacted] phone of approximately 2:15 hrs. Shortly before they called Mrs. [redacted] was on the way home and saw a large bright object and the children saw it too. She said it appeared to be similar to the object she has reported as sighting recently. As she entered the driveway the object came closer. It then entered the house and called for. I talked to both her and Mr. [redacted] for about 15 minutes. She said the object seemed to be stationary and changing attitude in more or less strictly vertical motion for a considerable time. I asked if they had a camera with film and they said no. I then advised that they call the police and then contact me again. When I had not heard from them shortly, I called the Quintanilla residence. The Quintanillas confirmed that the Smith's had called them and they had called the police. At this time I called the Dayton PD. They confirmed that the Smith's had called and reported the incident but the police had not yet arrived. At this time I called the Quintanilla residence again and they confirmed that the police had still not arrived. I talked to the Smiths again and they reported that the object was still there, but the police had not yet arrived.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that consists of handwritten text.

According to the text:
"as we were talking the lights flipped on and off - it was the object, not the aircraft. I couldn't say what it was but it sure acted interestingly as if it was a vehicle of some kind. As we were tracking it, this other object suddenly appeared out of nowhere and headed straight at us at a fantastic speed. When it got close, it stopped dead in its tracks and hovered for several seconds, then just as suddenly as it appeared, it took off at an unbelievable rate of speed and was gone. This other object continued to maneuver in a rather erratic manner, first one way then another, apparently descending at one point until it seemed to merge with or disappear into the trees below. I called the Sheriff's office and reported the incident. Shortly thereafter Deputy Barile (he was accompanied by Sgt. Koentopp) came to the site and said we were perfectly welcome to watch the UFOs as long as we didn't interfere with law enforcement activities - there was nothing in sight and that was the end of it. When the Deputy and Sgt. left, the lights began to flicker and the object reappeared, then after a short while it too disappeared. We waited for their return but they did not come back and the conversation was terminated."

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? THE ENTIRE OBJECT WAS COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE ENTIRE OBJECT WOULD BE FROM EXACTLY THE SAME ANGULAR SIZE AS THE MATCH HEAD.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The text found in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 25 DAY MARCH 1967 YEAR

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This object, although appearing to be quite high, would have been a very short distance from the observer if it had been a hovering helicopter with the flashing lights turned on. It did not exhibit the object number of times it flashed each moment, but it was not a regularly occurring flash which one would anticipate. This is my guess that the flash occurred something like 15 to 30 times a minute. Once or just a bit it was very difficult to locate again, and it soon pretty well in a clear blue sky.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

There were 2 bright lights, like stars, but larger. They were slowly moving and seemed to change direction at times. This happened at about 7:30 PM in Feb. 1967 at Little, Missouri. They seemed to be intelligent, guided objects and not normal. I haven't seen anything like them before. I would have said they were aircraft, but they didn't have the usual running lights and their motion was very erratic, going up and down and sideways and so on. I can't really guess what they were, but they were definitely not normal. Wouldn't want to go so far as to say they were spaceships, but they were certainly very strange unexplained objects in the sky. I don't know what they were, but I know they weren't anything I had ever seen before.

If the UFO organization has any information on similar sightings in this area, I would certainly be interested in knowing about it. It would be helpful to know if others have seen things like this and what they might be. There isn't much I can add, except to say that they were most definitely not normal aircraft or phenomena, and that I am really stumped as to what they could have been. I just know that they didn't seem to be of this world, but I don't want to go so far as to say they were spaceships either. They were simply strange unexplained objects in the sky that evening.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten narrative description of a UFO sighting.

Based on the OCR output:

THIS OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AS A LARGE BRIGHT WHITE TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED ALTITUDE OVER OUR POSITION. IT APPEARED AS BEING TWO WHITE LIGHTS WITH ONE RED LIGHT BETWEEN THEM. THEY WERE REVOLVING, THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND WE COULD BARELY MAKE OUT WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS, THEN IT SLOWLY ZOOMED DOWN CONSIDERABLY AND AS IT ALMOST REACHED THE HORIZON IT STOPPED AND IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES THEN DISAPPEARED. THERE WAS NO NOISE OVER THE HORIZON. THERE WAS NOTHING STATED IN THE DOCUMENTS AS TO WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS, BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT IT WAS NOT A STAR, AN AIRPLANE, A HELICOPTER, A WEATHER BALLOON, OR ANOTHER TYPE OF AIRCRAFT. THIS SIGHTING WAS AS A CITIZEN WHO IS INTERESTED IN THE SECURITY OF MY COUNTRY, AND IS TRYING TO HELP.
IF DO NOT PERSONALLY CARE WHETHER YOU BELIEVE ME OR IF ANYONE BELIEVES ME. I KNOW WHAT I SAW AND I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WAS SOMETHING ALIEN TO ME.

There is no photograph present in this page of the UFO report document. However, the image contains two diagrams - one showing the angles at which an object appears above the horizon and the other showing a compass rose.

The text that can be extracted from this page is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Talking about it again gave me an impulse to write about it as I more intensly remember some additional details. It happened near my home outside of city limits about 3-4 miles in a remote area. The object was silent, oval in shape and appeared to be a dull silvery color. It seemed to hover about 4-500 feet abov e the ground for 3-4 minutes. Then it began moving at a rapid rate of speed and disappeared. I was amazed at the time and remember thinking I'd never seen anything like it before. It's one of those things I can still picture in my mind even after all these years. I realize there are logical explanations, but this was very real to me at the time and I still can't quite account for what I saw. I don't believe I was overly excited or imagining things. I was simply an adult observer w ith no agenda trying to report what I saw as accurately as possible. I hope this added information is of some use to you. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT:
The witnesses were returning home from a drive in the country to see the snowcover from the storm. As they were going along the road in a straight course, they suddenly noticed a bright light or object in the sky. As they approached the cemetery, the object was still in the same position. Thinking it was a star, it did not seem to be moving in any particular direction. When they got up to the cemetery, the object jumped in front of their car. It passed the car and went through the fog. Mr. * stopped the car (facing away), put it in neutral gear and pulled the car off the road where they could watch the object further. The object appeared again behind some trees then it jumped up and down. 1) The automobile lights, radio and engine ceased functioning. 2) He felt an electrical sensation. 3) The object remained motionless, then moved off rapidly to the east. After it had gone, the engine, lights and radio began functioning again. As the object began to move away, it started to glow and Mr. * began screaming for his wife to get back into the car and suggested his jacket through the car window. As the object moved further away, the electrical tension was felt by both, but it finally disappeared into the distance. REFER TO DETAILED FORMS FOR SKETCHES

REMARKS:
Mr. * was a police record and is a rough-and-ready type of individual who under normal circumstances is not afraid of anything. This is the fact that a minute mark of various impacts of this sighting shook him to such an extent that the reports indicates that the police to evaluate it. The police described this individual as the police who know UNKNOWN with Ph'M effects. See detailed USAF PPO-Type questionnaires and full report for more detail.

12 PYLAND COURT 
WENHAM, MASSACHUSETTS

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT - 3/08/67 - 1:05 AM EST - Leominster, Mass.  
DATE: 20 April 1967
FROM: R.E. Power, Chairman  
NICAP MASS SUBCOM

TO: NICAP, Washington, D.C.                 cc:(Project Bluebook 
                                            Dr. J.E. McDonald)

BACKGROUND:
I received a telephone call from a Mr. X of Leominster, Mass. The caller reported that on the night of March 8, 1967, he had observed a semi-circular object over the Leominster region on the local sighting which was overlooked by our newsclip service. The object in question had reported the incident to NICAP's regional director in the area, and phoned to inform me about the sighting.

ACCOUNT: 
The witness, a Mr. and Mrs. X, were returning to their home after a dinner party. The weather was crystal clear, except for a localized pocket of what appeared to be ground fog or mist in the Leominster region. As they approached the cemetery, they observed a large light to their left over the cemetery (approx. 1/4 mile). The object was hovering and gave off a pulsating light. The said that she had not seen anything so turned around and drove down and drove off the road towards the cemetery and the light. As they drove closer the object rose higher and went down the road broadside to the cemetery and the light.

1) The automobile lights, radio and engine ceased functioning.
2) He felt an electrical shock and his body became numb and immobilized.

3) The arm he was painting with was pulled against the roof of the car and hit the roof with such a force that it left an imprint in the door and snow.

He cried for his wife to get back into the car in order to get back into the car. When he did not respond, the wife looked and she saw this arm across the door and noticed that his arm was numb.

She touched the metal car chassis at this point and he was unhandling. He seemed not to be able to get his arm out and the arm kept going back on and the object which had been rocking back and forth emitted a humming sound and the light was a pulsating light. 

It appeared to descend for about 100 yards and then headed straight for home. They only stayed home a short time and he had another in Vermont and Mrs. Leominster locailty who was his mother informed them that he had followed there before.

AUTOMOBILE INFORMATION

8) To reach a telephone, they had to leave home and drive by the lighting area they had seen the fog and object. There were no witnesses as to where the object had been centered. (This is what the witnesses told).

9) Both witnesses claim they have not read widely on the subject of UFOs.

10) Mrs. L. is known as a rough-and-ready individual who under normal circumstances is not given to hysteria or anything. After the story was checked out thoroughly it was reported that her account was fortcoming. The witnesses appear to have much.

INVESTIGATOR NOTES AND IMPRESSIONS (Frank Pechulis)

I talked with Lt. Matteo Ciccone of the Leominster Police Dept. He showed me a card indicating that the police received a phone call on April 9th. relating to the sighting. The Lieutenant knows Wallace Pretty well, and feels the witnesses are not only rational and well-balanced, but feel they had a very unusual experience.

I went and talked to him first that he could have been influenced to some extent by the published theories concerning this particular incidence.

CHAIRMAN FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION

Since Mr. Wallace has a Police Record, I decided to check further into his background. His record contained only minor offenses, and addressed 2:15 A.M. on April 9th. Her account is as follows:

She told me that she and her husband were awakened by the telephone ringing. Their daughter who resides with them told them that the end her husband had experienced a terrifying experience and wanted to report it to the police which they did. From her home and an officer was dispatched to the address given. The officer questioned Mrs. Wallace and her husband and they told them about the experience. She was extremely shaken up and had to be consoled. I questioned Mrs. Pechulis with a few details (minor) that had not been mentioned. There was no evidence and I am sure this and her son-in-law so thoroughly shaken-up that there would be any thought of fabricating the story. I asked if she thought there was anything unusual or spectacular about the object and she said: "No, it was just strange the way it behaved as if they had just undergone a terrifying experience."

I obtained Mr. and address from the telephone company and put in a call to her immediately. Her account is as follows:

Mrs. [redacted](re-married), [redacted], Albany, Vermont

The shared image does not contain any photographs, only text. Based on the instructions, I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

UFO RPT-3/08/67-Leominster, Mass.
(name redacted), et. albans, Vermont (name redacted)
Mrs. ------ stated that her son phoned her around 1:45-2:00 AM on the morning of March 8, 1967. He was very upset and excited that he could hardly talk at first. She confirmed the essentials of the report according to which he said he had observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) for about 10-15 minutes. He told me that it must have been something to upset her son as he was 'the type that doesn't get excited about anything'. The object remained stationary and then began to move off into the distance. It was a long-distance call and that he was fortunate to have seen what he claims he saw. He is a rational young man and would not resort to anything to indicate an hallucination.
A close examination of the enclosed detailed UFO Data Sheets combined with witnesses, (name redacted) statements, and the fact that there were freshly made marks in the garage door, have convinced me that the UFO sighting is a true observation of a real phenomenon. I feel that the police record statement of his would not ordinarily approach them unless something strange has happened to him. Moreover, he also had had problems with the police and yet his observation and reporting of this incident seems to me to tend to verify it, for reasons mentioned above.
The negative analysis, paralyzing, etc., are all characteristic of other sightings throughout our area. The characteristics are the following:
1) The mist or fog seems to have been directly connected with the presence of the UFO (as it disappeared).
2) The electrical-failure and paralysis occurred simultaneously with the sighting.
3) The even that occurred afterward an effort until the UFO moved away.
My evaluation is that the sighting falls into the category of "UNKNOWN" and that although one witness has a police record, a careful check seems to indicate validity of said sighting.
Respectfully submitted,
Raymond H. Fowler, Chairman

On the night in question, my wife and I were out sighting to see the low hanging Sovi ete Satillite pass over. As we were watching it move slo wly across the sky, we saw suddenly a bright light that seemed to appear, coming from the same direction as the Satillite. It was brighter than the Satillite and was more concentrated, with no blinking or pulsing. As we watched, it went down behind a tree to our left, and we could see the glow of it descending even though it was hidden from direct view. When it came into view again, it was a very bright and very concentrated light - larger than the largest star. I watched it drop straight down, turn sharply and move at tremendous speed in a horizontal direction. It then made another sharp turn and shot away to the north at a frightening speed, disappearing from sight in a couple of seconds. I was startled to the point that I did not notice exactly what color the object was, but I was impressed with its brightness and the fantastic speed and maneuverability it displayed. I tried to recheck the area where it had gone down and see if there was any glow or sign of it, but could not see anything further. I then turned my attention back to the Satellite, and it continued on its course as before, without any indication that anything unusual had occurred.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document from the Department of the Air Force, describing an investigation of local sources related to an unidentified phenomenon. The document mentions that an interview with traffic control personnel at Sky Harbor Airport revealed that there are approximately 1200-1499 "sorties" (aircraft movements) per day, 200 of which are under positive control. It also states that this accounts for "low level maneuvers" seen in the area of the report.

Text from the document:

AN INTERVIEW WITH TRAFFIC HANDLING PERSONNEL AT SKY HARBOR AIRPORT, PHOENIX, REVEALED THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 1200 - 1499 SORTIES PER DAY, 200 OF WHICH ARE UNDER POSITIVE CONTROL.

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

This replies to your letter reporting your unidentified flying object sighting.

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will add it to our files. However, it is important that a witness report his observation as soon as possible after the sighting. This enables the Air Force to make a thorough investigation while the incident is still fresh in the observer's mind.

I do not see that you saw - but it was obviously not familiar to you -- and appears out of the ordinary to the observer.

Thank you very much for your interest in our program. A copy of the report on Project Blue Book is enclosed for your information.

Sincerely,

BARNETT E. YOUNG
