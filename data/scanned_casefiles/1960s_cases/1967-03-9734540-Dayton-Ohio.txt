The bottom portion of the page contains a large black redaction/censorship block.

The text is somewhat blurry and not entirely clear, so some words may be misinterpreted. Some lines are illegible or only partially readable.

DEAR SIR:

WHEN COMING TO WORK THURSDAY MORNING, AT 5:30, I SAW WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A U.F.O. I WAS DRIVING DOWN SALEM AVE. TOWARDS THE DOWNTOWN AREA WHERE I WORK. I SEEN THIS AIRCRAFT CIRCLING THE DOWNTOWN AREA AS IF LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LAND, WHILE I APPROACHED THE RED LIGHT ON RIVERVIEW. THE AIRCRAFT DRIFTED TO A STOP OVER THE CITY, WHEREAS THE RED LIGHT ON THE AIRCRAFT WENT OFF, AND 2 WHITE LIGHTS CAME ON AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE. IT STOOD STILL FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES THEN MOVED A LITTLE SOUTH AND STOPPED AGAIN FOR 2 MINUTES WITH ONLY A BRIGHT RED LIGHT ON, AND MOVED AGAIN GOING EAST.

CAPT. THOMAS FLIZIMO
D.O.
100 MCMARCH, OTS 17 PH.

Cord 164

MAJ. Quintanilla,

I received a call from Mrs. [redacted] phone at approximately 2115 hrs. Shortly before they called Mrs. [redacted] was on the way home and saw a large, bright, spinning object near her house (she said that she has reported a similar sighting recently). As she entered the driveway the object came closer (cat this time the car head lights went out momentarily). She then entered the house and called FTD. I talked to the wife and Mr. [redacted] for about five minutes.

At this time the object was out the level behind the house and changing altitude (more or less strictly vertical motion) frequently. I asked if they had a camera with film and they said no! I also asked if neighbors were home, Mrs. [redacted] checked and said no! I then advised that they call the police and then contact me again. When I had not heard from the [redacted] by 2130 I called them. They said the object was still there, but the police had not yet arrived. At this time I called the Centerville Police Dept. - they confirmed that the Smith's had called and that the Warren County Sheriff was reacting (with camera, and film). I called the Smith's back at 2140 and they said the object was still there. It was large, about the size of a small house, and

according to M[illegible] made an indescribably disturbing noise when it came very low]. As we were talking the sheriff's car pulled into the driveway -- I asked Mrs. [illegible] if she could still see the object, at that moment she said it had apparently gained alt. and could not now be seen from where she was standing.

I stayed on the line while there was a discussion between the [illegible] and Sheriff's representatives. Shortly thereafter Deputy Burline (he was accompanied by Sgt. Montgomery) come to the phone and said there was nothing in sight and that they had not seen anything unusual on the way over. He said that they were going to make a complete check of the area. I then thanked them for their assistance and terminated the conversation.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 25 MARCH 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This object, although appearing to be quite high, could have been a hovering helicopter with its fuselage rotating slowly. It was too high to detect any rotor blades. We did not count the exact number of times it flashed each minute, but it was not a regularly occurring flash which one would anticipate. It is my guess that the flash occurred sometime like ten to a minute. Once we lost it, it was very difficult to locate again, since it was pretty small, in a clear blue sky.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   1   April   1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

When I saw the object through telescope it was perfectly still. Even stars move a little.

I hesitate sending in report because frankly I can't say anything about these reports at the time I called the object was still in sight. It asked to have someone sent out to see. This thing I for themselves but that was end of the question. No one seems to know anything or do anything. Wouldn't it be wiser to investigate the U.F.O. itself instead of the report only? I think so. If you do investigate these sightings I'd like to know just what we're seeing and I don't know, say so. Slim sorry but this is upsetting. I'm eager to over-ride again outright a little answer to.

THIS OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AS A LARGE BRIGHT LIGHT TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED WITHOUT GIVING ANY NOISE, AS IT CAME PARALLEL TO OUR POSITION, IT APPEARED AS BEING TWO WHITE LIGHTS WITH ONE RED LIGHT BETWEEN THEM, THEY WERE REVOLVING. THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND WE COULD NOT MAKE OUT ANY OUTLINE TO THE OBJECT. BY THIS TIME THE OBJECT HAD SLOWED DOWN CONSIDERABLY AND AS IT ALMOST REACHED THE HORIZON IT STOPPED AND IT HOVERED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES THEN DISAPPEARED DOWN OVER THE HORIZON. THERE WAS NO NOISE AND NO SMOKE. THE THREE LIGHTS STAYED IN THE SAME POSITION. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS, BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT IT WAS NOT A STAR, AN AIRPLANE, A HELICOPTER, A WEATHER BALLOON, OR ANOTHER CASE OF SWAMP GAS. I AM REPORTING THIS SIGHTING AS A CITIZEN WHO IS INTERESTED IN THE SECURITY OF MY COUNTRY, AND IS TRYING TO HELP.

I DO NOT PERSONALLY CARE WHETHER YOU BELIEVE ME OR IF ANYONE BELIEVES ME. I KNOW WHAT I SAW AND I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WAS SOMETHING ALIEN TO ME.

They had come down to Plevna to bring Ray Lake to the village. While driving near McIntyre Lake, they saw strange lights near their car. When they were in the Lucky Lake region, they stopped and watched the object, and are convinced they saw a "Flying Saucer". After it remained motionless on to their camp, and one chap was quoted as saying, "Their hair was still standing straight up when they got back."

The Ducharme Party held Saturday night. It was well attended. It was in the Clark-Mill Centennial Hall. Prizes for High score went to Mrs. Stanley King for the ladies, and Manson Kellar for the men. Low prizes went to "Bobby" Purves and Mr. Jim Corr, Kingston, and Bobby Herner, Ardoch.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT
The witnesses were returning home from a drive in the country to see the snowover from the recent snowstorm. As they proceeded SE on Lancaster Street, they noticed what looked like a heavy patch of fog surrounding a local cemetery. The sky was clear everywhere else. Passing through the fog, Mr. saw a bright glow vaguely from the cemetery. Thinking it was a fire and that the fog was smoke from the fire, he turned the car around and drove back and forth. What they observed was a large bright light source hovering about 400-500 feet above the cemetery. Mr. was stopped in car (facing NW), put it in neutral gear and pulled to the emergency brake up. He got out of the car, shut the door (window open) intending to walk into the cemetery to get a closer look. He pointed at the object and simultaneously several events occurred: 1) The automobile lights, radio and engine ceased functioning. 2) He felt an electric shock 3) The arm was pointing with was pulled against the roof of the car. He was totally immobile and could not move although he could think and hear clearly. His wife began screaming for him to get back into the car and tugged at his jacket through the car window to no avail. She felt a shock and could not remember if she touched the metal chassis of the car during this time. After a lapse of perhaps a minute, the object which was rocking gently departed emitting a humming sound. His wife reflexes were sluggish and he felt "heavy" all over.

REMARKS
Mr. has a police record and is a rough-and-ready type of individual who under normal circumstances is not afraid of anything. Due to the fact that a minute check of various aspects of this sighting proved to substantiate it in-addition-to the fact that the police, who know him well will believe that he was telling the truth, NICAP MASS submits this report as a good unknown with PEM effects. See detailed USAF PID-Type questionnaires and full report for more details. Complete reports are on file at NICAP-MASS, NICAP, WASHINGTON D.C., PROJECT BLUEBOOK and Dr. J. McDonald's Files, U. of Arizona. NICAP will send this report to U. of Colorado Proj.

NICAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SUBCOMMITTEE
13 Friend Court
Wenham, Massachusetts

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT - 3/08/67 - 1:05 AM EST - Leominster, Mass.
DATE: 20 April 1967
FROM: R.E. Fowler, Chairman
NICAP MASS SUBCOM
TO: NICAP, Washington, D.C. cc: Project Bluebook
Dr. J.L. McDonald

BACKGROUND:
I received a telephone call from Mr. of Leominster, Massachusetts regarding the sighting in the "Leominster Daily Enterprise" dated Friday, March 10, 1967 carried a small item on the local sighting which was overheard by our news service. Mr. had contacted the witnesses because of his personal interest in the UFO subject and later came upon my name in the book "Incident at Exeter" and phoned to inform me about the sighting. I dispatched NICAP MJ3 Investigator Frank Pechulis to investigate.
His interviews with the witnesses and with the Police Department took place on April 1, 1967. Additional follow-up work has taken place since.

ACCOUNT:
The witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. of were out riding to see the low-hanging snow-covered trees after a snowstorm. They had been riding about an hour and a half and were returning home along Lancaster Street. When they was parallel placed or located pocket of what appeared to be fog about St. Leo's Cemetery on Lancaster Street. As they drove through this mist, Mr. Wallace noticed what appeared to be a large light to his left over the cemetery (approx. NE) out of the corner of his eye. Thinking it may have been a fire and that the fog was actually smoke he asked his wife if she had noticed the light. She said that she had not seen anything so he turned around and drove back past the cemetery. Both saw a bright light somewhere hovering over the cemetery. He turned the car around again and put his windows down and drove off the road broadside to the cemetery and the light. His car was facing NW. The object was to his right approx. NE. He got out of the car, shut the door (window open) and started to point to the object. Simultaneously several events occurred:
1) The automobile lights, radio and engine ceased functioning
2) He felt an electrical shock and his body became numb and immobilized.

3)   The arm he was pointing with was pulled against the roof of the car and hit the roof with such a force that it left an imprint in the ice and snow.

Mrs. _____ yelled for Mr. _____ to get back into the car. When he did not respond, she slid across the seat and tugged at his jacket through the open window. (She felt no shock and cannot remember if she touched the metal car chassis at this point.) Meanwhile, Mr. _____ could not move a muscle although he could hear and his mind seemed to be functioning normally. Then the lights and radio came back on and the object which had been rocking back and forth emitted a humming sound and accelerated upwards and out-of-sight above the fog patch. Mr. _____ got back into the car, turned it around and headed straight for home. They only stayed home a short time and felt that they had to tell someone about it so they left to telephone their respective mothers about what had happened. Mr. _____ phoned his mother in Vermont and Mrs. _____ phoned her mother locally who told them to come over to their home. They did and she persuaded them to phone the police which they did. Later a police officer came down to get further information. They stayed at Mrs. _____ parents home talking about it until about 4:30 AM. It was an upsetting experience for both of them.

AUTOMOBILE INFORMATION

8)     To reach a telephone, they had to leave home and drive by the sighting area. The fog and object were no where in sight as they drove by the cemetery. (This means that Fog dissipated about 10 minutes after the object had left area.)

9)     Both witnesses claim they have not read widely on the subject of UFOs except newspaper stories.

10)    Mr. [redacted] is known as a rough-and-ready individual who under normal circumstances is not afraid of anything. He has a police record and if it were not for the fact that his story was checked out thoroughly, a report would not have been forthcoming. The slightly upset both witnesses very much.

INVESTIGATOR NOTES AND IMPRESSIONS (Frank Pechulis)

I talked with Lt. Matteo Ciccone of the Leominster Police Dept. He showed me a card indicating the police record of Mr. [redacted]. He also showed me the record-card of the police officer who questioned Mr. [redacted] after the sighting. The Lieutenant knows Wallace pretty well and feels that he was telling the truth about the UFO. My own feeling is that he was telling the truth. It is possible that since Mr. [redacted] talked to him first that he could have been influenced to some extent. It appears that Mr. Wallace is a rather fearless character who does not scare easily.

CHAIRMAN FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION

Since Mr. [redacted] has a Police Record, I decided to check further into his story. I found out his wife's mother's name and address via [redacted] and called her witness's knowledge at 2:15 PM on April 9th. Her account is as follows:

Mrs. [redacted], [redacted] Street, Leominster, Mass

She told me that she and her husband were awakened by the telephone at 1:30 AM on the morning of March 5th. It was her daughter who related that she and her husband had experienced and who wanted to see her to talk about it. She said that her daughter was so upset that she told her to come right over. She urged them to call the police which they did, from her home and an officer was dispatched to her home to interview them. Her account of what they told her checked out perfectly with what the investigator Pechulis with a few details (minor) that had not been mentioned.

Mrs. [redacted] stated that neither her daughter or her daughter's husband were under the influence of liquor and that she never seen her son-in-law so thoroughly shaken-up. I asked if she thought if there were any chance they made up the story. She stated that she could not believe they would do such a thing. There was no reason and that they behaved as if they had just undergone a terrifying experience.

I obtained Mrs. [redacted] mother's name and address from Mrs. [redacted] and put in a call to her immediately. Her account is as follows:

Mrs. [redacted] (re-married), [redacted], St. Albans, Vermont


- page 156 -

UFO, RFT-3/08/67-Leominster, Mass.                                                SHEET 4

[Names redacted], St. Albans, Vermont

Mrs. [redacted] stated that her son phoned her round 1:45-2:00 AM on the morning of March 8, 1967. He was so upset and excited that he could hardly talk at first. She confirmed the essentials of the sighting account. He described the sound of the object as a high-pitched screeching sound when it moved off. She told me that it must have been something to upset her as he was "the type that isn't afraid of anything". The paralysis seemed to be a major cause of his being so upset. She finally had to remind him that it was a long-distance call and that he was fortunate to have seen such a thing. He retorted that he hoped she would never go through what he just did and ended the conversation.

A close examination of the enclosed detailed UFO Data Sheets combined with various checks such as I have mentioned above (For example, Frank checked the garage which Mr. [redacted] had hit and there were still two marks freshly made in the garage door) have convinced me that the UFO sighting is authentic. The police know the witness and feel that he behaved as if he had undergone a bad experience and that due to his police record, he would not ordinarily approach them unless something really out-of-the-ordinary did occur. (I recall that a teen-ager that shared in witnessing the classical 9/3/65 Exeter, N.H. sighting also had problems with the police and yet his observations were checked out and verified by the police. Thus, the fact of his police record does not necessarily rule out the validity of his sighting. In one way, it tends to verify it, for reasons mentioned above.)

The rocking motion, bright glow, humming sound, electrical-ignition failure, paralysis, etc. are all characteristic of other sightings throughout the world. (Apparent reference to the following possible "cause-and-effect" events: (*))

1) The mist or fog seems to have been directly connected with the presence of the UFO as it disappeared when the UFO left and was not moist like natural fog. It was clear everywhere else. (See U... Weather Report (Addendum I).)

2) The electrical-failure and paralysis occurred simultaneously with his arm pointing at the object. It was only his arm that was thrown back by some force and pinned to the roof-top of the automobile. He felt it "being pulled" to the roof.

3) The events of 2) above remained in effect until the UFO moved away.

My evaluation is that the sighting falls into the category of "UNKNOWN" and that although one witness has a police record that a careful check seems to indicate validity of said sighting.

(*) - Chemical Plants and locality of sighting could be connected.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman
NICAP Mass. Subcom.

Meteor Sighted
A bright object flashed across the sky at 9:20 this morning, leading to inquiries of area officials. Pfc. Stephen L. Lowrey, on cruiser patrol on Water Street near Krysiak Avenue, described the object as a meteor. Leominster and Lancaster had reports of "unidentified flying objects." No calls were received by Fitchburg police. The sighting was confirmed by William Wallace in the vicinity of St. Leo's Cemetery, Lancaster Street.

We were on our way home, off use Lancaster St. We have to pass the area on our way home. As we pass the cemetery I noticed what looked like a large light to my left, I asked my wife if she saw anything and she said no, I was certain I had, and decided I would look again. In the second pass my wife saw it also, I then turned our windows and came back again, I also got excited, and told my wife I think we have something here, and returned to point of light, I came to a halt, got out of my car, upon getting out I parked at object, my car stalled, lights went out & radio stopped playing, I was unable to move, my wife was in panic, my mind was not at all affected, just could not get like shock at numbers, I was there 30 or 40 seconds before object moved away, it moved quickly at increasing speed not instantly, I was able to move again and I got in the car, I turned my car around after starting it, my electrical system came on again and seemed normal, my reactions were slow & sluggish I felt my doors on the way into driveway, it is 20 min before I felt able to move light, with good coordination

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This replies to your letter reporting your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for internal purposes. At this late date, it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that a witness report his observation as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force installation. This enables Air Force personnel to verify a comprehensive investigation.

I don't know what you say -- but it was obviously not familiar to me. We do not define UFO as any aerial phenomenon or object which is unknown or appears out of the ordinary. The observer's report on Project Blue Book is enclosed for your information.

Thank you for your letter we appreciate your interest in our program. A copy of the report on Project Blue Book is enclosed for your information.

Sincerely,
