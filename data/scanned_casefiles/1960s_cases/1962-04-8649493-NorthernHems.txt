The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" on it, representing how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger sketch of the object's position when the observer last saw it, with an "A" and "B" to indicate the object's movement. The third sketch is a smaller sketch that appears to be similar to the larger one, but provides less detail.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The image contains a photograph of a comet, which appears to be Comet Seki. The text accompanying the image describes the comet as being as bright as Halley's Comet and discusses its appearance and properties.

ASTRONOMY
Promising Comet Seki 
Disappoints Astronomers
COMET SEKI---Expdted to vle with Halley's comet in brightness, Comet Seki, discovered by Japanese astronomer Seki, has instead faded so much that it can barely be seen. It was first sighted on Oct. 7, 1961, flagstaff, Ariz. photograph shows Seki when it was at its brightest, Nov. 4, 1961, when observers claimed it would eventually equal Halley's famed comet in brightness.
ASTRONOMY
Bright as Halley's Comet
NOW A FAINT OBJECT
A Comet that was expected to become as bright as the famed Halley's Comet has instead failed to live up to the predictions of astronomers and is now a faint object in the constellation Leo, the Lion.
When Comet Seki was first discovered on Oct. 7, 1961, at the Flagstaff. Ariz., observatory of the United States Naval Observatory, it was thought that it might become a spectacular sight in the night sky, even rivaling the brightness of Halley's Comet.
However, by the end of November, as the comet continued to recede from the sun, it instead faded in brightness to the point where it can barely be seen with the unaided eye under ideal observing conditions.
Dr. Bancroft W. Sitterly of the National Astronomical Observatory of the University of California at Berkeley, told Science Service that "the comet simply failed to live up to the expectations of astronomers."
"It will pass by the stars and can be seen quite easily with small telescopes and binoculars, but it will not provide the spectacular show that we were hoping for," he added.
Dr. Sitterly explained that Comet Seki was first reported on Oct. 4, 1961, by the Japanese astronomer Tsutomu Seki, who discovered the Comet while he was observing the galaxy Messier 101 near the constellation of the Hunting Dogs.
After its discovery, astronomers eagerly watched the comet's progress, and by early November it was bright enough to be easily visible in the evening sky low on the western horizon. At that time, it was so prominent that it could be seen without optical aid and was being compared to Halley's Comet.
However, by the end of November, the comet had receded from the sun and was fading rapidly, dashing the hopes of astronomers that it would put on a brilliant display.
"It is unfortunate, but this is the way it goes with comets," Dr. Sitterly remarked. "They can be unpredictable and sometimes fail to live up to expectations."

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet with a handwritten description of an observed event.

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)
In order that your information may be filled and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may report information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

[Handwritten text]
I sighted a silver colored APR C 19:40 22 Oct 62. The object was first observed in the northeast moving in a northerly direction. It appeared to be elongated in shape and was flying at a high altitude. It would appear and disappear and then reappear again at another location continuing on a northerly course. The object would reappear across the sky and the course it was taking appeared to be erratic. At times it appeared stationary, then would move rapidly, again appearing to be stationary. This continued for approximately 30 minutes. After this time, the object disappeared completely and was not observed again. The object appeared to be silver in color and was not seen to make any sound. No other objects were observed in the vicinity at the time.

The image contains a photograph that appears to be a satellite or celestial body map. The text mentions "COMET SEXTILIS" and describes it as "Computed by N.A.C.A. on the basis of the data. Observed first night Aug. 4". There does not appear to be any other image or photograph in the document.

The Editor
Sir: instead of greeting's from AT-&T Pat Knapp V.P. In line with the A.T.&T.'s policy of being courteous and helpful, "HAWKINS: "STATIC UNIVERSE"

A much abbre-'cited statement of Gerald Hawkins' SATURN THEORY appoared in the N.Y. Times, who while stating his views on the expanding universe theorty, said: l) that he considers the universe as now not expanding at ail, and consequently it may have been in a static state for billions of years.

Aloha, comments are Dr. H. has "static-universe" theory is somewhat similar to my own personal views and as subsequently published in Western Science Review. It was stated in layman terms without going into technical details, Such a theory follows the contours,as it were, of the whole universe and not merely specific Phenomena.

Up from washington 24 July were these welcome visitors - Diana Unger, Mr. Lenny Fineman and wife, Mrs. Lenny Fineman, and Marsha MacLeod, all from Washington. D.C. Michael, the young son of Leonard Kramer of the Finnish Embassy visited 22 August.

ATTENTION, PUTATIVE PAPER PUBLISHERS:

A proposal of guidelines for professional papers to be presented to meetings of national and international scientific societies - and copy sent to U.S.A. to World Health Organization -- is now in the "SAI".
