ASTRONOMY
Promising Comet Seki Disappoints Astronomers

COMET SEKI, expected to become as bright as Halley's comet, has disappointed astronomers. (See SNL, 90-304, 1961.)

Halley's famous comet appeared in 1910 and a first magnitude display, which is rare, was predicted for Comet Seki. Comet Seki has been observed as only fifth magnitude, Dr. Elizabeth Roemer of the U.S. Naval Observatory, Flagstaff, Ariz., told Science Service.

This is just visible to the naked eye under good seeing conditions. However, Dr. Roemer said, the comet has not significantly brightened to fourth magnitude by this time and could not be observed.

The astronomer has observed Seki from the time it appeared, and has photographed it with the 40-inch reflecting telescope at Flagstaff. Since the tail was not as bright as expected, Dr. Roemer said, after its discovery by a Japanese amateur astronomer, when last observed at Flagstaff on Nov. 11, Seki had become a faded blob trailing a few arcseconds, the remnant of a once promising comet.

Seki, which was expected to have reached its greatest brightness as it came closest to earth, 12,000,000 miles away, on Nov. 14, moved south rapidly and could be seen only from the Southern Hemisphere after that time.

ASTRONOMY
New Comet May Become Bright as Halley's Comet

A NEW COMET, expected to become as bright as the famed Halley's comet, is now moving across the skies and approaching the earth.

It can now be seen with the naked eye before sunrise in the constellation Leo, the lion.

The comet was named Seki, after its discoverer, a Japanese amateur astronomer. Calculations made on the comet's progress by Dr. Leland E. Cunningham of the University of California at Berkeley indicate that the Seki comet will be of almost first magnitude.

During the second week of November, it will pass by the earth and can be seen very low on the southern horizon. It will then have moved from Leo into the constellation Herta on its southward journey.

Besides Halley's comet, last seen in 1910 and expected again in 1986, there are other first magnitude comets. Arend-Roland and Mrkos, were seen in 1957.

Comet Seki was first reported on Oct. 11 in Harvard College Observatory. Calculations indicate it is the first visual information in the Western Hemisphere.

However, by the end of November it is expected to be visible from the United States again, although it will now have faded even further and be about seventh or eighth magnitude, Dr. Roemer said. At that time it can barely be seen with binocular but will be visible through small telescopes.

Dr. Roemer said comet Seki will continue to move away from the earth and by mid-January it will be difficult to observe even with very large telescopes.

HAWKINS' 'STATIC UNIVERSE'
A much abbreviated statement of Gerald Hawkins' "static universe" theory appeared in the N.Y. Times July 20. Said the Times, while the two currently "expanding universe" theories hold 1) that the universe is expanding outward toward ultimate over-complexity and 2) that, perhaps, cosmic horizons are expanding, Hawkins postulates that the universe is now not expanding at all, and consequently one may suppose that it had no beginning and will have no end.

A study, comments out Dr. H., the "static universe" theory is relatively old, having been introduced by him in 1963 and subsequently published in Nature and Venus Cinemato. It was stated in layman terms that the "static universe" in the Sky (News review) last October. Such a theory follows, he declares, from "cosmographic" iron analysis of red-white data initiated by his further, Myron, Marvell and Savage.

UP FROM WASHINGTON 24 July were those welcome receptive SI visitors James Bradley and Mrs. Dorothy Rosenberg with a few to a corner Assistant Treasurer Otis Martin, and an old Smithsonian friend, Leonard Reamer of the Firm which avails SI accounts.

Attention, Putative Paper Publishers:--
A schedule of deadlines for professional papers to be presented to meetings of national and international scientific and other groups -- everything from the Acoustical Society of America to the World Health Organization -- is now in the SAO library.

"A GOOD MAN" says Clancy, a member of our hard core staff here. "Here's what he did..." And so it is not time, as we move, that has been looking at steadily or the Pole Star that we are keeping constant and move with the motion.
