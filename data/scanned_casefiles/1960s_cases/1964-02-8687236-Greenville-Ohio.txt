REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDX
SUBJECT: Extract from Duty Officers Report                                   25 Feb 64

TO: TDEW

The following, extracted from Capt Farr's OD Report dated 24 Feb 64, is quoted for your information:

"At about 2115 hours received a call from the WAFB SDO that he had received a UFO report from a Mr. [redacted] from Greenville, Ohio. Two lights about 3 fingers above the west horizon. Observed for 30 minutes and seemed to be sinking slowly. Quite bright, non-blinking, white. Contacted Capt Quintanilla of TDEW who said he had seen them also and that they were Venus and Jupiter. Did not bother to make out a FTD Form 164, in view of Capt Quintanilla's comments."
