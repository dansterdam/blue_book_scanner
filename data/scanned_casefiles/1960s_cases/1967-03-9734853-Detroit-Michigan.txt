Commanding Officer
Information Division
Project Blue Book (ATIC-CRLD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, OHIO 45433

Sir:

We find enclosed two Police reports and your form filled out from the report of the eight person who observed three UFO's on the evening of March 6, 1967.

Our records reveal no previous contacts with the person making the report. It is noted at this time that a Lake Central Airlines plane crashed at Detroit City Airport immediately before the reported sighting.

Investigating officer's are of the opinion that the reporting person's account of what he observed was possibly influenced by the fact that the air craft crashed. The first reports were that the air craft exploded before the crash.

Assuring you of our desire to cooperate in all matters of mutual interest.

Sincerely,

Michael Brom
Sergeant
Bureau of Records

This report appears to describe an incident where the officer received a call about three unidentified flying objects. The report provides details about the sighting, including that the objects were moving and appeared to be different colors. The objects were reported to be too far away or too high for the witnesses to identify accurately. The report mentions that the objects corresponded with the brightest of the three and that the sighting was similar to previous UFO reports.
