Dear Sir:
I never thought I would ever see an object so low and nearly as long as a football field! My wife, her brother, and I were traveling east on US 40 near New Palestine, Indiana. The time was around 9:00 PM on March 17, 1966. As we approached the sighting location, we saw a very bright light and several smaller lights attached to it. It was hovering about 30-40 feet above the ground and flying in a crooked S-like formation. Since then, several people have reported seeing the same or similar objects in this area. A New Palestine, Indiana resident about 14 miles east of Indianapolis.

The text reads:

We are very interested in finding out all we can about these sightings and would appreciate any help you can offer.

P.S. Nothing that made a wonder about this low and clear but made one sound.

Thank you very much
Sincerely
[Signature redacted]
