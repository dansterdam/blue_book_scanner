Dear Sirs,

I never thought I would ever see a 'UFO' and really was never sure they existed. However; my wife, her brother, his wife and myself saw ten feet of them the night of march 17, 1966. It was about 9:00 pm and to dark to distinguish their shape. All we could see was the two red lights on each one. (only one of the lights blinked.) The lights were about 15-20 ft. apart and the craft were about 25-30 ft. apart and flying in a crooked snake like formation. Since then several people have reported seeing them. This sitting took place just north of New Palestine Indiana about 14 miles east of Indianapolis.

Send 164

We are not interested in finding out all we can about these sitings and would appreciate any help you know too after.

P.S.
Nothing that made us wander about these things was fast that they were low and close but made no sound.

Thank you very much
Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
