REF CASE - 16 JUL 1952
MARCH - FIG 1102

At 2115 hours on 14 August 1952, two persons in the city of Constantine say a luminous object flying at high speed toward Guelma. According to the observers, the apparatures which had no resemblance to a flying saucer, emitted a very bright light. At the time this happened, the local weather bureau had not launched any weather balloons.

The same day, at 1920 hours, many people at the docks of Philippeville say in the sky an enormous red disk going from north to west, leaving behind a greenish trail.

SAUCER-LIKE CRAFT SEEN IN SPAIN--TANGIER, ESPANA, 12 AUG 52

According to the Cifra news agency, on the evening of 10 August 1952, a resident of Cuenca, Spain, while walking along the Cuenca-Madrid road, saw an object similar to the so-called flying saucers. It crossed the sky at high speed and gave off two luminous trails.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document that appears to be an excerpt from a report on meteors observed by astronomers.

METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying the motion and behavior of their "shooting stars".

Mr. G. A. Linnartz, an officer aboard the American C. S. S. Norman, reports that at 1720 Greenwich, December 16, 1955, he observed a brilliant meteor. It appeared near Deneb at 30° altitude bearing 310° and moved toward the horizon and disappeared at an altitude of about 5°, at which time it became very bright and left a trail which lasted about 25 seconds. During the entire time of observation the meteor appeared to be of a greenish-blue color.

On the same night, at approximately 29.94 inches, air temperature 81° F., sea temperature 55° F., another similar meteor was seen both before and after the first, but only for a very short period of time.
