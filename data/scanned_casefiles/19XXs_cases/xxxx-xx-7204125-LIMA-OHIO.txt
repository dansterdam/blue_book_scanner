J ust had a sigheing of a UFO. Observed a bright circular light in the sky traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. Light was too bright to see any definite outline or shape. Craft disappeared in the east. Observed for about 30 seconds. No sound was heard. This is the first time I have had an experience like this and I am at a loss to explain it.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO or flying saucer-shaped object with a dark, elongated shape at the bottom. The sketch appears to be part of an old Project Blue Book report document.

LIMA, OHIO
ON or about 7, 1951, at approximately 9:15 P.M., Mr. and Mrs. XXXXX of XXXXX, Ohio, were returning home from a visit to their daughter and son-in-law, who resided in the south end of Lima, Ohio. As they were traveling northwest on U. S. Route 224, about five miles southwest of Lima, they observed a bright light in the sky. At first they thought it was an aircraft. However, as they continued to observe it, they noted that the light appeared to be hovering or stationary in the sky. After a short time, the light appeared to dart or move rapidly across the sky, at which time they noticed that it was an object or saucer-shaped craft, much larger than an ordinary aircraft.
The object appeared to be about 50 to 75 feet in diameter, and was described as being dark in color, with a slight luminous glow around the edge. It was estimated to be traveling at a speed of approximately 500 to 600 miles per hour. After traveling a short distance, the object stopped abruptly, hovered for a few seconds, and then took off at a terrific rate of speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.
The duration of the entire sighting was estimated to be approximately two or three minutes.
