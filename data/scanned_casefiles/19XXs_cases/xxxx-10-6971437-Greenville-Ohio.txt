The image shows a form with sections for date, time, group, location, source, witnesses, length of observation, type of observation, course, photos, and physical evidence. The "BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS" section indicates that the observer sent a 16mm but it was not retrieved.

October 29

I would like to inquire about an unusual sighting 15 miles north of Greenville on October 28. As you will recall, it was a very rainy, cloudy evening.

My chemistry went out to see if this object was all right as it seemed so unusual to him. He was having some trouble with the binoculars on his telescope, and no one else was near by when it suddenly disappeared. There were bright flashes that seemed impossible, like those that are produced by the sodium glows that sit at the end of the runways. These bright flashes appeared about once every second. Even though the disappearance was sudden, nothing but the flashes were visible. 

He thought that this could be an airplane flying either very low and slow or very high and fast, but he decided against this after considering that those were not conditions favorable for flying. The flashes moved steadily to the south and were not visible after three minutes, even with the use of the binoculars.

He concluded that this was one of your weather balloon, but being so sudden without proof in 00 ', I would appreciate it if you would tell me if his conclusion was correct. Thank you.
