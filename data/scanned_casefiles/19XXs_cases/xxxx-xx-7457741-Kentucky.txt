AERIAL UFO (MAJ H QUINTANILLA, JR. /70916/mha/26 SEP 67)
UFO Observation, 16 August 1957

FAA Control Tower
ATTN: Watch Supervisor
Portsmouth Municipal Airport
Portsmouth, Ohio 45662

1. The Aerial Phenomena Branch is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from the Grange Airport Group, Kentucky on 16 August 1957 at 2:30 hours, EST. The observer described the object as an orange light on the horizon under which a red light in the bottom was visible. The object was estimated to be at a height of 3 to 4 miles and 17 August, and estimated the height of the object to be at 5000 ft.

2. Since Grange Group is approximately ten miles from Portsmouth, perhaps personnel in the control tower observed a similar object. Any information or observations, especially if they observed anything unusual, would be helpful.
