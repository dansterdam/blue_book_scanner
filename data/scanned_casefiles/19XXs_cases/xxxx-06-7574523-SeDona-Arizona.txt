The image contains a sketch or diagram drawn by the witness, along with some written text describing the observed object. The sketch appears to show a cluster of around 5-6 bright star-like objects against a dark background, possibly representing a UFO sighting. The text indicates that the witness observed an "OBLONG OBJECT" with "2 STAR LIKE OBJECTS" approximately 90 degrees above the horizon.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output all the text found in the document:
