ATTN: DCS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sightings of unidentified flying objects. Attached files of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendations as to action to be taken. It is requested that any information or data which you believe will be of value to Project "SIGN" be furnished your headquarters to this office.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has the data and records to which the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on all sightings of unidentified objects on which it has conducted investigations. These checks are usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" office. IGILAX-3 - these checks are distinct from the normal monthly statistical reports submitted to the Weather Intelligence Division of the Department of Commerce. (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service. 

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed incidents are sighting the greatest probability of being balloons. This list does not necessarily eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining incidents may also be balloons.
