Text transcribed from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curve: line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

ITEM/UFO (Maj. Quintanilla/79016/mas)  
UFO Observations

Frederick, Maryland 21701

1. Reference your recent unidentified flying object sightings. The information contained in your April 13, 1967 sighting is not sufficient for a detailed investigation. Request you complete the enclosed PID Form 164 and submit the information on your April 13, 1967 sighting.

2. At this late date it would be extremely difficult to investigate your sighting. Your observations as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base for further analysis. By doing so, it enables the Air Force more thoroughly to investigate the sighting.

3. Enclosed is a brochure on the Air Force's UFO program, Project Blue Book.

The image contains a photograph, but it does not depict any human faces. The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document describes three UFO sightings made by the author, including the observation of a yellow-gold colored object, the sighting of a circular object near a mountain, and the observation of an object with a vapor trail. The document also mentions taking a picture of the object through a telescope, but the details of the photograph are not provided.

Dear Sir: 
I am writing to you about three sightings I have made and my theory of what the UFO's are. First, my sightings.
(1) I saw a yellow-gold colored object. I don't even remember the time of year. My best friend also saw it and two smaller objects of the same color were seen to come out of the thing. This object was very far away.
(2) One Tuesday in January of 1957, [redacted] and his brother and I were looking at the moon through [redacted] telescope. There were about five stars in the entire sky at that time. There were a good many clouds in the sky but it was not hazy until the sun was setting behind the mountain. From behind a cloud, Randy saw a circular object heading down to the mountain top (see drawing "A" at end of letter) at an angle. It had a vapor trail and there was no noise at all. We focused [redacted]'s telescope on it and watched it go behind the mountain. Through the telescope we could compare the object with the trees at the top of the mountain. We took a picture of it through the telescope but the object was about the size of the full moon that we had been watching. The thing that puzzles me the most is that there was a trail.
(3) I saw this object on April 13, 1957. As I was coming from a friend's house at about 8:15 P.M., I noticed a blinking red and white light about as bright as the brightest star. It was like two stars sitting side by side. It was a nice clear night.

There is no photograph present in this document. The document appears to be a handwritten letter from someone describing their UFO sightings and theories. The text of the letter is as follows:

"night and the wind was blowing just a little bit. See drawing "B".
Now that I have finished with my sightings, I will start with my UFO theory. You have heard about Jean Dixon, the Washington, D.C. woman who predicted J.F.K.'s murder? In many cases people have communicated with space beings through "mental telepathy", a type of U.S.P. I believe that clairvoyants like Jean Dixon are probably the first of people on earth to have "the gift of prophecy". I also believe that in the near future somebody will invent "nonrocket interstellar travel". I think that we aren't too far behind our space neighbors, I say about 25-30 years. I would like to have any information you have on UFOs.
I would appreciate a reply to my letter as soon as possible.
Thanking you, I am
Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]"
