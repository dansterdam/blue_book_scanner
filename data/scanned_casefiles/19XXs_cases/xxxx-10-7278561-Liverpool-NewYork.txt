The text below the photograph provides a detailed account of the observation, including the location, date, duration, and a summary of the analysis. The text states that the object appeared as a bright light and changed colors very fast, and that the witness reported the object moving rapidly from west to east.

Dear Sir, I appreciate your willingness to take such an interest in the flying saucer matter. However, I must decline to discuss the details of any particular case further, since in view of the fact that the matter was covered in the newspapers, publicity is undesirable. I hope you will accept my sincere thanks for your time and cooperation in this regard.

Sincerely yours, [Redacted]

P.S. I would like to have an answer as soon as possible.

A. Some kind of light, blue-green (brighter than normal) and round in shape looked unusual - nothing to indicate a point source but rather like a piece of the sky itself was emitting light. It appeared to be suspended in the air and remained in one place.

B. Round, very bright, white-yellowish light, larger than a star, moved at a fairly fast speed, then stopped momentarily and disappeared.

C. Feezy

D. point of light, brighter than stars, about the size of a dime held at arm's length, no noise, no trail, no apparent motion relative to the stars in the background.

This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the Air Force Project Blue Book regarding a sighting of a UFO.

Text extracted from the document:

Nov 7, 1967

Dear Torn:

This will reply to your letter, postmarked October 31, regarding your sighting of a UFO.

Many details necessary to identification of your sighting have been noted from your letter. However, we are unable to complete the attached questionnaire, and forward it in the enclosed envelope, as an examination of flight records showed no small disc-shaped UFO in the Liverpool, New York area on the date you reported. 

In the future, should you sight another UFO, please contact the UFO investigator as soon as possible, preferably by phone. By so doing, you will have a much greater chance of having your sighting adequately investigated.

In the meantime, we are sending you some material which may help you determine what you saw. We hope you will find it interesting, as well as informative.

Thank you for your interest in the Air Force project concerning unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten text. The text appears to be a description of some type of unidentified flying object observation. It mentions two objects, one larger than the other, and describes their behavior and movement. The text also includes a request at the bottom that asks the reader to "Please Answer as Soon as possible, send me some UFO and Pamphlet Free of Charge".

Extracting the text from the document:

the light seemed to explode, then contract. It changed colors it always stayed the same 5 colors. It would speed up to cover a great distance in a second, then slow down to a crawl. It was hovering with the approach of an airplane when it suddenly disappeared. When South west to south east way it could of been a ship.
There were 2 objects. one about one quater as big as the other. object appeared from the bigger one. (we think it was because it want over to look at the other one. it curved around and came down again and moved away. ) then the little one stopped the bigger one, and started up and kept going. disappearance, it was going FAST.
Please Answer as Soon as possible, send me some UFO and Pamphlet Free of Charge.
