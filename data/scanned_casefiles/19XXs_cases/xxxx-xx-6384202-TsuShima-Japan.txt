"AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. AT 1825:19, 16 JULY 1959, I OBSERVED A DEEP PENETRATION OF AIRCRAFT NEAR THE AIRFIELD, AT ABOUT 4,000 FEET ALTITUDE.

2. THE AIRCRAFT APPEARED TO BE JET AND CIRCLED THE AIRFIELD THREE TIMES. IT APPEARED TO BE WHITE IN COLOR AND MADE A SHARP CLIMB TO THE NORTH AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

3. ALTHOUGH THIS INCIDENT WAS OF SHORT DURATION, IT WAS VIEWED WITH SOME ALARM SINCE IT OCCURRED DURING TWILIGHT HOURS NEAR THE AIRFIELD. THE OBJECT WAS UNDER CONTROL AND APPEARED TO BE MANEUVERABLE. IT WAS TRACKED ON RADAR AND WITNESSED BY SEVERAL OBSERVERS.

4. WHATEVER THE NATURE OF THIS INCIDENT, IT UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR CONSTANT VIGILANCE OVER OUR AIRSPACE.

Comments of Approving Officers:
The size and the speed of the object, the azimuth of the planet "Mars" was about 255 degrees and the elevation at 1900 hours local time was about 10o. The downward movement of the object as described by observers is believed to have been due to slight refraction due to the low angle of elevation. With the sun just below the horizon, conditions would be ideal for the appearance of Mars as described.
