TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

On the occasion of the sighting of an unidentified flying object at Oakridge, Tennessee on July 26, 1947, the following report was filed:

At approximately 5:15 P.M. on July 26, 1947, an unidentified flying object was sighted over the Oakridge, Tennessee area. Witnesses reported seeing a bright, metallic, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky.

The object was observed for about 10-15 minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view. Several employees of the Oakridge facility reported the incident to local authorities.

An investigation was conducted by the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book. Photographs of the object were obtained, but the quality was poor and did not provide definitive evidence of the object's nature or origin.

The case remains classified as "unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files due to the lack of conclusive information about the observed phenomenon.
