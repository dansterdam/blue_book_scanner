AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUMMARY: Observation of Unidentified Object
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 6 September 1953
DATE OF REPORT: 28 September 1953
LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: 5 miles SW of Bakersfield, California, U.S.A.
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
The following is a summary and narrative of the observing pilot:
At approximately 11:15 AM PST on 6 September 1953, the pilot of a T-33 jet trainer aircraft observed a bright, elliptical-shaped object approximately 10 to 15 feet in diameter and a brilliant, silvery-white in color. The object appeared to be hovering at an altitude of approximately 12,000 to 15,000 feet, approximately 5 miles SW of Bakersfield, California. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, during which time the pilot took evasive action to obtain a better view, climbing to an altitude of approximately 19,000 feet. The pilot was unable to make a positive identification of the object, and it appeared to be stationary. The object then accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view.
ACTIONS TAKEN: Reported to the nearest Air Force base.
No further information available to the radar operator.

While stated in the report, I observed that a round, glowing object with red and green lights was sighted hovering and moving at a high rate of speed near Bakersfield, California on August 22, 1955 at approximately 10:30 PM. The object was observed for several minutes and was described as metallic in appearance, approximately 50-60 feet in diameter, and displayed an erratic flight pattern alternating between hovering and rapid acceleration. No sound was reported. The incident was investigated by the Air Force and the report concludes that the object's identity could not be established conclusively.

AF FORM 112â€”PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DATE Feb 12,1947 	 REPORT NO. 100-F

FROM: (Location) Bakersfield, California

SUBJECT: Unidentified aerial object observed at Bakersfield, California DATE/TIME GROUP: 12 Feb 47 / 1530L

STATEMENT OF FACTS:

The object was first observed about 3:30 p.m. on February 12, 1947. It was oval in shape and about the size of a "basket ball". The color was a brilliant silvery blue, making a gloating reflection when the sun shown on it. The object appeared to be moving at about 800 to 1000 miles per hour. The observer stated that he did not hear any sound connected with the object. He stated that the object climbed straight up into the air, and then moved from north to south at a tremendous speed. 

When the object first appeared, it seemed to be about 10 miles high, and then rapidly climbed to around 20,000 feet, where it appeared to be the size of a pin head. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes from the time it was first sighted until it disappeared from sight.

The observer stated that he had a pair of binoculars with him at the time, and that he used them to view the object, which enabled him to observe it clearly.

So far as this command is concerned, investigation indicates that the reported sighting was not duplicated by any local or military aircraft or radar installations, and, as yet, no other reliable observers have come forward with additional information concerning this incident. No photographs were obtained.

The signature is blanked out.
