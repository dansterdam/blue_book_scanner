TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

TDFR (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/mhs/6 Jun 68
UFO Observation, 14 April 1963

Greenville, Ohio 45331

1. Reference your unidentified observation of 14 April 1963. We connected the SPASE DETECTION CENTER at APL, Colorado, and they informed us that two pieces of satellite debris decayed at the time of your observation.

2. Since the exact times of the decays are not known, we can only state that it is very likely that you observed one or the fragments decaying into the earth's atmosphere. Satellite reentry appears similar to that of a fireball except that the debris is much longer than a meteor observation. Satellite decay is usually white-blueish in color and has an elongated fiery trail.

3. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

AUCTION SERVICE
GREENVILLE, OHIO 45331

April 17, 1959

Wright Field
Dayton, Ohio

Attri: UFO Dept.

Gentlemen:

On April 11, 1959, our family was about 5 mile NW of Piqua, Ohio, on old route 25. The moon was very bright and we were observing it through binoculars when our attention was arrested. 

Our entire family of 5 observed it by the naked eye and through binoculars. It was an object that moved through the sky at a tremendous speed. It was visible for several minutes. At times it displayed alternating colors of blue, green, and red. It was many times the size of a star. It would suddenly disappear and then reappear. It did many things that a conventional aircraft could not do. However, it was not high up in the sky. It appeared to be at a very low altitude. 

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
