HOMESTEAD AFB, FLA. (APR 10) -- THE AIR FORCE HAS COMPLETED AN INVESTIGATION OF THE UFO SIGHTING BY THE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS OF CREATIVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ON APRIL 7TH. 

THE MAJORITY OF THE WITNESSES DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS WHITE WITH A RED LIGHT THAT FLASHED ONCE. THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED ALONG A LINE NORTH-NORTHWEST OF THE SCHOOL. WITNESSES DIFFERED AS TO THE SIZE AND DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT.

THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER, WHITE WITH RED TRIM, WAS MANEUVERING IN THE AREA OF NORTH PERRY AIRPORT BETWEEN 9:31AM AND 11:07AM THE MORNING OF THE REPORT. THE HELICOPTER WAS PRACTICING LANDINGS AND TAKEOFFS IN EAST-WEST DIRECTION BETWEEN 9,500 AND 11,000 FEET ALTITUDE.

NORTH PERRY AIRPORT IS ALMOST DUE NORTH OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND APPROXIMATELY THREE MILES IN DISTANCE.

The Air Force concludes that given the time of the day with the sunlight, the manufactory of the white and red helicopter, the witnesses could not definitely identify it as such.

As to the number of objects sighted, the white and red objects was the only constant description given. The Air Force attributes the other objects to the high number of small aircraft activity in the vicinity of North Perry Airport.

10 CHAOTIC MINUTES
By JEROME MOFFETT
The following is a description of strange occurrences which took place in the Opa-locka, Florida area on April 23, 1952. According to the report, the witness, a retired Army sergeant and his family, observed a luminous object in the sky which hovered over their home for about 10 minutes. The object was described as "cigar-shaped" and emitting a "dull glow". It was also reported to have made sudden and radical changes in direction and altitude during the observation.

THE METEORITE 

On the evening of April 7, 1952, at approximately 8:30 p.m., various residents of Opa-locka, Florida, witnessed the appearance of an unidentified flying object. The object was described as a bright light which seemed to hover over the area for a few minutes before shooting straight up into the sky and disappearing.

According to the report, the object was first spotted by a civilian named Vernon Ledford, who was outside his home at the time. Ledford immediately alerted his neighbors, and several other people in the area also observed the strange light in the sky.

The report states that the object was estimated to be about the size of a car and was emitting a bright, glowing light. It was said to have hovered motionless for a short period before rapidly ascending and vanishing from view.

No further details or conclusions are provided in the document.

The image does not contain any photographs. The text in the document states "It Says it Was Copper, People Who Saw It Say No", and below that there is a block of text describing the alleged sighting of an unidentified flying object. At the bottom of the image, there is a heading that says "The Air Force World Admit It".

Here is the text from the document:

It Says it Was Copper, People Who Saw It Say No
According to report: On October 12, 1949, a large object was sighted over Opa-locka, Florida. The object was seen by several reliable witnesses, including a few pilots. The report states that the object was copper-colored, but the people who saw it said it was not copper, as the report claimed. The object was seen to ascend rapidly and then disappear. No further details are given about the object's size, shape, or behavior.

The Air Force World Admit It
- What has the Air Force actually admitted about UFOs?
- The Air Force has stated that some UFO reports may involve unconventional aircraft.
- However, the Air Force maintains that it has found no evidence that UFOs are extraterrestrial in origin.
- The Air Force has acknowledged that some UFO reports cannot be easily explained, but it believes these can be attributable to natural phenomena or man-made objects.
- The Air Force does not claim to have definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation.

Children Contend:
AIR FORCE WRONG
About made UFO

As a helicopter, said the past movement for several years. The Air Force report of this incident, did appear in the newspaper reports. It was frightened, and Air Force public to make it seemed like something they did not want to admit to.

One witness who was with the children at the time, saw the object as a half disc shaped, or saucer like. It was hovering about 40 to 50 feet above the ground, and then shot away at a very high rate of speed. The children were frightened, and Air Force public relations tried to change the story.

The object was seen by many others at the same time, and this should be in the official Air Force report. It was a good case, and if it's true, it shows the Air Force have covered up many UFO sightings in the past.

Many schools should look at it, it was a good case, and it shows what the Air Force is doing about UFOs.

Extracted text from the document:

EYEWITNESS REPORT
RETURN OF THE UFO

There was one object, round in shape, appeared to be hovering. This object seemed to be about five to six hundred feet in the air. It was a silvery color and appeared to have lights of some kind blinking on and off at intervals.

The object was viewed for about fifteen minutes, during which time it remained stationary. After the fifteen minutes it slowly moved off to the west and disappeared from sight.

The object was silent and no noise was heard from it whatsoever.

This object was later identified as a typical flying saucer type of UFO.

REPLY TO
ATTN OFt BPR

SUBJECT: Investigations and Findings

TO: FTO (DDETIR)
Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433

1. The following information is forwarded in accordance with AFR 80-17.

a. A report of UFO sightings was forwarded to Homestead AFB at 2207/8 Apr 67 by the Dade County (Hialeah Elementary School) located at 201 NW 17th Street, Miami. Copies of the statements received from the three teachers are attached. (See Exhibits A, B, and C)

b. Further investigation revealed that a Coast Guard helicopter was operating in the general area of the school. Instructions were to hover three miles to the north to perform a "touch and goes" from the end of the runway. The helicopters were white with red and black markings. The maneuvers began at 0931 just fourteen minutes before the sightings were first made.

c. As the color and maneuvers corresponds fairly well to those reported, the maneuvers were in conformance to those on the attached descriptions, the range and direction of sighting are the same as that of the North Perry Airport, and the sun was in such a position as to possibly have caused reflections which led to the initial observations, SAFOI has determined that no further investigation, upon query demand, issued a news release on 10 April 1967. See Exhibit D.

2. Exhibits F, G and H give an accurate portrayal of both the reactions and responses experienced which have resulted subsequent to the release of information on this incident. No derogatory information has been officially answered as no further statements have been received from Homestead AFB by any news media. The atmosphere surrounding this incident is somewhat emotional. In fact, it appears that the investigational reactions have been significantly exaggerated in the public's mind. Mass reaction to any stress situation often deviates from the norm which would be displayed had each person been isolated from those around him. Finally, once an individual unequivocally states that he saw a "flying saucer", normal psychological responses would tend to compel him to maintain his story against all attempts at refutation.

Below is the text extracted from the document:

at logical solutions which vary from his account. The answers to
such questions "Why was there no sound", "why did no one else see
it", "was the sound observed" - indicate the observers might not even
be jet engine run ups as high as one mile and propogating at high RPM are hard to distinguish at close range, let
alone at one to four miles.

. In the wake of this first report, 15 separate unrelated
reports were filed within a one week period. Many of these
are still under investigation. Information on these will be
forwarded, where applicable, as soon after investigation are
completed as possible.
