5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 minutes 
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: 
8. NPS
9. PHOTOS:
 X Yes

 X Yes
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observed an object that darted like a bird at high altitude. The object appeared to be the size of a small dog or house. The object disappeared at the top with a slight flick of motion. Several persons on the scene state that it looked similar to a bird except no wings could be seen further stating that the object was quite slow in motion and darted up and down the steps. The witness states that "I went up the steps and to the ground still watching what I thought was a new object. I thought it might be a bird under unusual conditions."

IT WAS ABOUT AS BIG AS A SILVER DOLLAR HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. IT WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO BE FLOATING. IT MOVED WITH VERY LITTLE NOISE IF ANY. I TRIED TO CALL MY NEIGHBOR BUT SHE DIDN'T HEAR ME. I WATCHED IT FOR SOME 30 MINUTES AS IT MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY GOING FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE GOING VERY FAST.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects. The text on the page is a narrative explanation provided by an individual about a sighting of an unidentified object.

THE INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS INADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE INCIDENT.

I started out of the house to look around as there was a bright light in the sky. The light was moving in a rather curious manner, It did not seem to be a plane or a star, as it was too low, about the size of a small star, and a greenish-blue color. I observed it for about 10 minutes as it moved in an erratic manner, jumping about, and then suddenly it disappeared.

It was a clear night and I could see a number of stars. I watched the light for about 10 minutes and it maintained its brightness and color the whole time. The other lights in the sky, which were undoubtedly stars, did not behave in this manner. I have no explanation for it.

I was amazed and puzzled by this phenomenon, as I have never seen anything like it before. I am at a loss to account for it in any other way than that it was some kind of an unidentified flying object. Please consider this report.

It appeared to me like a duck at right head on. It wa s like a shape like a duck but seemed ot be about twice the size of a duck. It had a grayish color and when I noticed it, it just seemed to be hovering not gaining or losing altitude. It didn't have wings or propellers or anything visible on it that I could tell. It just seemed to be hovering with no visible means of support. It appeared to be silently. 
It seemed to be directly overhead with a reddish tool.

It is estimated to have lasted about 15 minutes. As it appeared low and approached toward us, I paid close attention all the while, noting the various changes that occurred. The object appeared first as a dimly lighted four or five foot ball of light about five feet above the ground, hovering motionless. It then rose slowly and silently to a height of perhaps 80 or 100 feet, where it remained stationary for a few minutes. It then dropped straight down to within about 20 feet of the ground, hovered there for a time, then shot straight up and out of sight, leaving a luminous trail behind. Throughout its maneuvers it gave off a steady, soft white light and although it appeared quite large when close, there was no outline or definite shape visible - just the uniform glow.

YES NO UNKNOWN

What did your attention to the phenomenon?
I observed a bluish-green spherical object that seemed to be about 300 feet above the ground. The object was moving north at a moderate speed. Then suddenly it accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared from view. The entire observation lasted about 5 minutes.

How did it finally disappear?
It just disappeared as though it was shut off. It was about two miles away when it disappeared, north of town.

Did it pass behind or in front of something, like a cloud, tree, or building at any time?
It went behind some small clouds near the north horizon, then came back into view and then accelerated and disappeared.

A teardrop shaped object is sketched in the document. The text in the document describes the object as having a teardrop shape.
