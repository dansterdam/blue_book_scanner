The image contains a sketch showing a compass and instructions related to estimating the height of an object above the horizon. There is no photograph present in this image.

27: In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a handwritten response to a questionnaire related to a UFO sighting. Here is the text from the document:

As near as I can recall, an orange glowing ball was slowly toward the west. The light stopped, then started moving again toward the northeast.
The orange light was moving erratically, as it moved.
At times, it seemed at a distance, and at times, it seemed very close.
The light went out.
