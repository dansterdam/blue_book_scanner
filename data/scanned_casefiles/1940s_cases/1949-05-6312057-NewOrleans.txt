Mrs. [redacted] appeared to be a person of average intelligence and reliability. A neighborhood check revealed that Mrs. [redacted] is well liked in that neighborhood and is considered to be an average person and not very likely to exaggerate or imagine things. The description of the flying object by Mrs. [redacted] is very similar to that made by Mrs. [redacted]
dated 26 May 1949, subject, "Unidentified Flying Object." Mrs. [redacted] stated that she had told no one of her observation until a newspaper article appeared about a week later naming a "flying disc." Mrs. [redacted] then called Mrs. [redacted], and told her
that she had seen a "flying disc." The close similarity of the two descriptions, with the exception of the dates sighted, may have been partly caused by the two informants talking their observations over on the telephone prior to being interviewed.

UNCLASSIFIED

DETAILS:

1. Headquarters Fourth Army on 9 June 1949, furnished report 
of unidentified objects which had been sighted, in New Orleans, La.
Three separate reports were submitted on incidents which occurred
on 16, 19, and 23 May 1949.

2. At 1630 hours, 18 May 1949, Mrs. ████████
New Orleans, La. sighted one unusual aerial object
while sitting on the back steps of her house. Informant compared the 
object to a single engine Naval training craft, stating that it was
silver in color, but resembled an ordinary dinner plate. The object
was in sight for ten minutes and was approximately 1-1/2 miles distant,
moving in a generally east to west direction. Object flew at a level
plane and made no maneuvers, but travelled in an end-over-end fashion
at a speed comparable to the Naval training plane previously mentioned,
and which informant advises she has seen many times. New Orleans PIO
making report commented that Mrs. ████████'s report might have been in-
fluenced by a discussion with Mrs. ████████ which is set forth in the
following paragraph.

3. On 19 May 1949, at 1615 hours, Mrs. ████████,
New Orleans, La. sighted one object in the sky.
Her attention was was attracted to the object by the sun's reflection
from it. The object appeared to be a flat, round disc, comparable
in size to that of a small airplane. Mrs. ████████ saw the object for 
approximately five minutes, during which time it moved in a direction 
from east to west. Informant believed the object to be between 150
and 170 miles per hour in speed, and object travelled on a level plane
and made no maneuvers. In both of the above incidents the weather
was clear and the light conditions were good. Both interviews were
conducted on 23 May 1949, and reports were submitted directly to AWC.
Copies of original "guide to Investigation - Unidentified Aerial Objects"
on file at DO #10.

4. On 23 May 1949 at 1850 hours, Mrs. ████████,
New Orleans, La. observed on object at a distance of approximately 
1-1/2 miles. Informant's thirteen year-old son first noted the object
and attracted his mother's attention. The object appeared to be round,
compared to a weather balloon, grey in color, and was moving from south
to north-east. Object was in sight for approximately 30 seconds, and 
Informant compared the speed to that of a small observation plane. No
maneuvers were noted. Mrs. ████████'s considered to be reliable, and not
in the habit of telling falsehoods, or exaggerating. Report furnished
directly to AMC by Fourth Army. Copy is on file at DO #10.

In an interview on 25 May, Mr. 
   ██████████ of Dallas, Texas, stated substantially as follows: He is a construction
   and labor foreman, and at 2100 hours in the front yard of his home, he 
   happened to see a long irregular line of about 75 to 100 objects in
   the sky. These objects were flat, circular in shape like a smoke ring,
   were smaller than a man's fist held at arm's length. Objects appeared
   to be approximately 1-1/2 miles away and were moving from east to west.
   They were in sight for approximately three seconds, moving at a speed
   estimated to be 800 to 1,000 miles per hour. █████ stated that they
   were very dim, just enough to see, about like a 5 watt light globe. No
   maneuvers were observed and no sound or odor noted. Interrogator stated

at arm's length. In this instance a trail of white smoke with the 
persistence of approximately 15 minutes was observed emanating from
