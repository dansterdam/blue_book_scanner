(1) On 1 August 1949, the following article concerning the
sighting of unconventional aircraft was published in the Ohio State
Journal, Columbus, Ohio:

"Strange Ship Soars Over East Side"

"The sky over the east side of Columbus was full of strange
stuff last night, according to reports to police, who investigated
thoroughly but sufficiently to start investigation."

An east side call: "Police we saw a flying ship with red
striped portholes lowering over head between 7:15 and 7:25 p.m.

"Later, _____ told police ha had
seen it to[o] then hit[s] in the sky. Pretty soon one light blinked
out, then the other he said. The time? Between 7:15 and 7:30
p.m."

(2) On 1 August 1949, at another location, a garage at Fifth
Avenue, Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed, concerning a huge ship
which he saw in the sky. This informant said, and stated thus:

On 31 July 1949, at approximately 1815 hours, I saw an
object in the sky, very high, at an altitude of about five thousand
feet. It's color was dull metal - was traveling in a westerly
direction - was very round and clear cut, twice as tall
closer circles in the vicinity of the object. The object was oval-
shaped, provided with clear and about five times the size of the
United States Navy airplane, the "Constitution." I did not see an
exhaust trail, and I heard no sound. When I first saw the ob-
ject, I called to a ________ who was standing on his
property at ______________ talking, to his sister.
__________ Columbus, Ohio, and asked them if they could see the
object. As I pointed out they into the sky, they said that they
could see the object. As we stood, two strangers appeared to drop
from the object. These were circular, and their color was similar
to that of the object.

The document features three sketched images under the captions "First View," "Second View," and "Third View." 

The "First View" sketch appears to depict a classic flying saucer shape viewed from the side, somewhat elliptical in shape with a dome on top. 

The "Second View" sketch shows the same object from directly underneath or above, illustrating a circular shape with a center spot, possibly representing the dome.

The "Third View" sketch presents the object at an angle where both the circular bottom and the side with the dome can be seen, providing a three-dimensional perspective.

to the vivid heat from a blast furnace. The flares were approxi-
mately the size of an average score? or foom light, and they were
illuminated for about one minuts. The flare remaind stationary,
one near the lower right and the other near the lower left of the
object. Two thin larmed yellow and were horizontal. First they 
radiated their two foot? while the were extinguished, that the 
under the object the light had formed a hase ground thro phenomena,
making it difficult to see it clearly. When the flares were ex-

fifth the size of the setting sun. The object and sphere then
apperead to rise and both disappeared into the clouds. I can re-

without any hesitation or thought.

On 1 August 1949, [REDACTED], machinist,
Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed concerning an unidentified objects he
saw in the sky, and stated in substance:

At approximately 1915 hours, 31 Jul. 19[REDACTED], 
                 Columbus, Ohio, called to see and asked if I
could see a star,—but he and I saw two objects or lights. I came out
immediately, [REDACTED], and I got in two cycles. I calculated the remaining
judo-pro distance in a town-nova, but the objects were light. They
were round, and approximately the size of a "loomis-itty" and about
a brilliant light similar to white hot or molten metal. The sky
was generally clear, but there were some clouds in the west. The
objects or lights were traveling slowly in a southerly direction.
I heard no sound and did not see any exhaust trail or odor of
bomerol. I have no further information concerning this phenomenon.

Agent's note: Informant Walker gave his information in a
sincere straightforward manner, with no apparent exaggeration. He
stated that informant [REDACTED], who was an unidentified airman,
had called at his home at 22,00 hours to have two corroborators, for a
police report, his and [REDACTED] discovery of the objects earlier in the
evening. While waiting for red railway to arrive, [REDACTED] told [REDACTED]
that he informed his conscience to astronomy as a "hobby", was interested
in all current events, and had read nearly 300 fictional and
non-fictional books. [REDACTED] further stated to the undersigned that
[REDACTED] appeared slightly imaginative and acted peculiarly. [REDACTED] had
informed Walker that he had no sleep Saturday night because of worry
over his wife and not-yet-born baby.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY

On 1 August 1949, ________ motor oiler, _________ Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed, concerning a space ship which he saw in the sky, and stated ir substance:

On 31 July, 1949, at approximately 1915 hours, I saw an object in the sky, very high, at an altitude of about five thousand feet. The object was due west and was traveling in a westerly direction. The sky was generally clear, but there wore small fleecy clouds in the vicinity of the object. The object was oval-shaped, greyish-blue in color and about five times the size of the United States Navy airship, the "Constitution." I did not see an exaust trail and I heard no sounds when I first saw the object, I called to a ____________

takin; I called the to his sister, _________ who was also on his property at ________ and asised them if they could see the object. As I pointed duo west into the sky they sai& that they could see the object, as they spoie, two flares appeared to drop from the object. These were circular, and their color was similar to that which heat from a blast furnace. The flares wore approximately the size of an average search or floodlight, and they were illuminated for about one minute. The flares remained stationary, one near the lower right and tho other near the lower left of the object. They then rose very slow and rose extinguisha, first the right and then to the left. While the flares haj remained stationary under the object the light had forroa a haze around the phenomenon, making it difficult to see it clearly. When the flares were extinguished a sphere dropped from the object and settled directly underneath it. This sphere was a brillant white area about one-fifth the size of the setting sun. The object and sphere then appeared to rise and both disappeared into the clouds. I can call nothing further concerning this incident. (C-3)
