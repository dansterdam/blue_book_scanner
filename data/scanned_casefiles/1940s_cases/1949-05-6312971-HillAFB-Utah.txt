TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

On the afternoon of 25 May 1949, I was in the Supply and Salvage 
Yard with Colonel Petersen and Mr. Shaughnessy of the Inspector's 
Office, and Lt Gable and Mr. Van Leeuwen of Base Salvage. While we
were standing in the yard discussing the condition of the Salvage Yard,
I heard an airplane overhead, which sounded to me to be quite high. I
looked into the sky in the direction from which the sound seemed to be
coming and could not discern the plane. However, in scanning the sky,
I observed a globular object traveling slightly east of south, at what
I estimated to be approximately the same speed that a C-47 travels. I
remarked to the company in general that I saw a globular object and Lt.
Cable, after asking me the general direction, stated that he saw it
also. He also remarked that he saw one a while ago traveling in the
same general direction. I only saw the one and did not know that he
had seen one previously until I called his attention to the one I saw.
We discussed the probability of its being a weather balloon.

With no basis for my judgment other than the fact that when I first
saw it, I expected to see a plane, I estimated it to be at least 40,000
feet above sea level. The first view lasted possibly 15 seconds, after
which I lost sight of it, then some 15 to 30 seconds later I saw it the
second time for possibly 10 seconds. With north as zero, I estimate
the first sight was at 1 o'clock. Mr. Shaughnessy stated that he glanced
at his watch when I mentioned it and the time was 1407.

The object seemed to me to be over the west slope of the Wasatch
Range and slightly south of due east of Hill Field, which if my impress-
ion of the height and distance was correct would indicate that the
object was considerably larger than a weather balloon.

DETAILS                                                           UNCLASSIFIED

  1. This investigation is predicated upon request by Captain PELHAM R. DUNN, 
District Commander, 16th District OSI(T), Hill Air Force Base, Hill Field, Utah. 
Captain DUNN'S request was based upon a telephonic call from 1st Lieutenant 
_____ who reported that he saw an object flying at an altitude of 
approximately nine (9) to ten (10) thousand feet AGL, at 1100 hours, in a south easterly 
direction. A few minutes later, same saw a second object travelling on a parallel 
course to the first object, at an altitude of approximately nine (9) to ten (10) 
thousand feet AGL and going in a southeasterly direction. Lt. ____ called the atten-
tion of W/O [Warrant Officer] _______ the first object and in so doing, it is 
claimed to the object. (See signed statements of ____ and ____ attached as Inclosure #2 and #5.)
Lieutenant Colonel _____, inspector General, Hill Air Force Base, Hill Field, 
Hill Field, Utah, and W.O. _____, Administrative Inspector, Hill Air Force Base, 
Hill Field, Utah, were members of the group, but did not see either object.

  2. Special Agent ADAMS F. DEVALK assisted in this investigation.

  3. On 25 May 1949, Lieutenant _____ (pilot), Salvage 
Officer, Hill Air Force Base, Hill Field, Utah, was interviewed and stated that he, 
in the company of three other gentlemen (named in details), were in the west salvage 
Yard, Hill Air Force Base, Hill Field, Utah, at about 1105, MDT, when the sound of an 
airplane attracted his attention. When _____ located the airplane, he said it was an 
F-51, travelling in a southeasterly direction, approximately eight (8) miles away and 
about ten (10) thousand feet AGL, flying. The object _____ saw was a little below the 
airplane and behind it, travelling possibly forty (40) MPH faster because 
could see the object overtaking the airplane. _____ estimated the speed of object to 
be three hundred (300) MPH. _____ then turned to his companion, _____ 
(PICTURES and ____ were standing a short distance away.), and called his atten-
tion to the object. _____ did not see either the first object or the airplane, but did 
see a second object, similar in shape, travelling in a southeasterly direction, 
further east than the airplane turned north and he then kept watching the second object 
which he said was travelling a parallel course to the first object, but south of it, and 
lower at a speed of about three hundred (300) MPH. By this time, the first object was 
out of sight. _____ described the first object to be circular and of the first, a dull 
silver color and reflecting the sunlight. ____ described the second object to be 
circular, dark blue on one side and silver on the other, reflecting the sunlight.

  4. On 25 May 17th, Mr._____ interviewed, Assistant Air Inspector, Hill Air Force 
Base, Hill Field, Utah, was interviewed and stated that while he was working in the 
surplus in the west salvage Yard, Hill Air Force Base, Hill Field, Utah, he heard an 
airplane quite high and looked upward to see it while doing so, his attention was 
attracted to a circular object emitting cast of south at approximately fourteen 
thousand (14,000) feet AGL, travelling about the same speed a circular fore-
ward travelled. _____ watched the object for about fifteen (15) seconds, then lost sight 
of it momentarily. The second view of it lasted for possibly ten (10) seconds, 
further stated that this was not the first object which _____ saw. The time was estab-
lished as 1107 MST for the second object, which was globular in shape, dark blue and 
flashing sunlight. (See signed statement of _____ attached as Inclosure #3).

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

This is in relation to foreign objects I sighted in the air in the vicinity of Hill Air Force Base at approximately 1405 M on 25 May 1949.

I was at the West Salvage Yard of Hill Air Force Base, escorting Lt Colonel Petersen and party on an Inspection visit and Mr. ---------
of the Air Inspectors Office and I stopped for a moment to discuss some-
thing or other. While talking with Lt. ------- I was watching an F-51
cruising south of the field, approximately eight miles, when I sighted
a dull silver circular object, which at first looked as if it were follow-
ing the P-51. I thought it might be an aerial gunnery sleeve of some kind,
but the object was going approximately 400 MPH faster than the P-51 and
seemed to be much father away and higher. Then the P-51 started to turn
to the left and the object went straight ahead until it was out of sight.

I turned to Mr. -------- and asked him to look, and pointed to the
direction I had seen it and asked him if he could see anything. He said
"No, I can't see anything there, but look over there." To the north of
the path of the first object and also going southeast, was another
circular object. The side away from the sun looked dark blue and the
other side was silver colored and flashed, as if reflecting sunlight.
It looked like it was lower than the first object, traveling southeast
from the field and could be seen more clearly than the first object;
It was about the size of a full moon. Mr. -------- and I watched it for
maybe a minute until it disappeared from view and we wondered if it
might be a weather balloon at that time of day with a perfectly clear
sky except for a few scattered clouds far to the south.

We walked over to Colonel Petersen and told him what we had seen
and he advised us to call the OST and let them know so they could check
on whether they were weather balloons or what they might have been.

Occupation and hobbies:
Pilot + Salvage Officer

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s)

NARRATIVE SUMMARY
On 25 May 1949, Lt. [REDACTED] (Pilot), Salvage Officer, Hill
AFB, Hill Field, Utah, was interviewed and stated that he, in the company of three other
gentlemen (names in details), were in the West Salvage Yard, HILL AFB, Hill Fld, Utah
about 1705 MDT, when the sound of an airplane attracted his attention. When located
the airplane, he said it was an F-51 traveling in a southeasterly direction, approximately
(5) miles away and about ten (10) thousand feet MSL, high. The object [REDACTED] saw was a
little below the airplane and behind it, but traveling possibly forty (40) MPH faster
object to three hundred (300) MPH. [REDACTED] then turned to his companion, Lt
[REDACTED] (Patterson and Shaughnessy were standing a short distance away) and called his
attention to the object. [REDACTED] did not see either the first object or the airplane,
but did see a second object, globular in shape, traveling in a southeasterly direction.
[REDACTED] further stated the airplane turned north and he then kept watching the second
object which he said was traveling a parallel course to the first one, but north of it,
and later at a speed of about the same (300 MPH) to thirty (30) MPH faster, the first object
and out of sight. [REDACTED] described the first object to be circular and the first; a dull
silver color and reflecting the sunlight. [REDACTED] described the second object to be cir-
cular, dark blue on one side and silver on the other, reflecting the sunlight.
