SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

The following information is taken from an article in the SAVANNAH MORNING
NEWS, dated 24 July 1949

"Darien, July 23. - Flying saucers, rockets or whatever one may choose to
call the mysterious lights currently being noted in the evening sky, this reporter
has at last seen one.

"Driving south along the Coastal Highway near Darien Thursday night about
7:50, there were five others in the car - Mrs. _________, Mrs. 
Charles Lewis, Martha Marsh and Gale Doan. All saw the phenomenon, though it was 
in view less than a minute. It appeared first as a strong white light with an 
afterglow, streaking across the southern sky from east to west, then it became 
the color of flame and disappeared instantaneously as though it had been turned 
off with an electrical switch.

"The night was cloudy, there were no stars visible, and the light, while 
it appeared about the size and shape of one of the lights of a plane, traveled
with far greater speed than that of any aircraft ever seen in this section.

"Mr. and Mrs. _________ of South Newport, who were driving along the highway
at that hour, also reported seeing the mysterious light." (F-6)
