There are two images present in the document. Both images appear to be simple, hand-drawn illustrations of objects. The top image depicts what seems to be a horizontally elongated shape with a dark shaded area on the top portion, while the bottom one has a similar shape but is completely filled in with a dark shade. Here is the text from the document:

Incident #149 - North Jutland - 15 January 1948

There is nothing in the major description of this
incident that precludes the possibility of the objects' being
meteors. The description would also allow for their being rockets.

However, the explosion of the objects favors the meteoric
hypo-
thesis.

It might be well to note the similarity of this and
other Scandinavian reports to the "green flash" objects reported
from New Mexico.

---

Various parts of North Jutland have reported that on 19 Jan at 7:30 AM the so-called flying saucers were observed. The phenomenon has been observed in Hj√∏rring, the Scaw and Hjerp. The objects were surrounded by a bluish light and had tail of green light, moving east west. One observer thought they looked like three balls. Several observers in the Scaw say they were rocket-like objects which suddenly stopped, exploded and disappeared.

M/A COM NT. Impossible to get any verification of this from Danish officials or Danish War Ministry.
