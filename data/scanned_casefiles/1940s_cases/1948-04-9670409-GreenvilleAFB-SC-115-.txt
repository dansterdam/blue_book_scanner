Officer, Greenville, S. C. subj: Report of Sighting Flying Discs,
dtd 13 Apr 48, fm Maj to Commanding General, AMC, Wright-Patterson 
AFB, Wright-Patterson, Ohio. ATTN: TSDIH 

1. Speed: Undetermined. Stationary, then rapidly
   accelerating and climbing.
2. Heading: North.
3. Maneuverability: No display except acceleration.
4. Altitude: approximated 15,000 feet plus.
5. Sound; none audible.
6. No exhaust or condensation trail.

7. General remarks: Witnesses were attracted by the sound
of 51st fighter aircraft in the vicinity. They observed buzzing
the sky for the aircraft and sighted this object. Two firs
tall object, two witnesses thought it was a jet made weather
balloon, however, when they determined that it was under
absolutely no wind, they became less skeptical. Possibly not
a balloon. The object was in a stiff formation on a little 
North of Greenville, S. C. on a line that could be drawn 
South Lima. The objects moved so rigidly that they were out of
sight within a few seconds. From initial sighting in the 
stationary position to their disappearance, a period of approx-
imately two (2) minutes elapsed, of which the objects were in a 
a stationary position for approximately one (1) minute, & a 
great blast was thunk twice and on each occasion the local 
weather conditions substantiate same, however, the object 
had been released and no positive report is available. Conditions 
at the report made at Laurens 77*19 was 49*17, 1948, the wind at
10,000 feet was wind rose from 360 degrees at 10 knots per hour. These 
and at 20,000 feet, from 340 degrees, at 10 knots per hour. The 1830 
hour raw report indicates winds at 10,000 feet from 25 degrees 
at 15 knots per hour, at 14,000 feet from 24 degrees at 4 knots per 
hour and at 20,000 feet to 20 from 52 degrees at 13 knots per hour.
Nearest weather station releasing balloons is Spartanburg, S. C.,
one black balloon was released at 1230 EST.

S T A T E M E N T

On the 15th day of April, 1948, at approximately
1615 hours, I, with Lt. -----, was standing in front
of our squadron orderly room. As we were talking, I
heard the sound of fighter aircraft flying and I looked
in the sky in this direction of the sound. Whereupon, I
noticed one (1) white balloon object on a Northwest
heading. I then noticed that there were two (2) objects,

These objects were at an estimated 15,000 to
20,000 feet and seemed to be stationary; then these
two (2) objects seemed to accelerate very rapidly in a 
northerly direction and at the same time, seemed to be
climbing until they were lost to sight. It is estimated
that these objects were visible for not more than three 
(3) minutes.

------ and myself discussed the possibility
that the objects were weather balloons. I, personally,
checked the weather office to determine if weather
balloons had been released and it was informed that no
balloons had been sent aloft.

The image appears to be a highly degraded and poor-quality photocopy or scan of a document page. There is a very faded photograph present which is hard to discern due to the quality of the copy. It seems to show a dark elliptical or disc-like shape against a light background which could be the sky. The rest of the image consists mostly of text that is difficult to read because of the quality, along with redaction marks obscuring certain portions.

Here is as much of the text transcription as can be made out from the visible portions, though some portions are illegible and cannot be accurately transcribed:

At approximately 1415 hours Captain [REDACTED] and myself were standing 
in front of the flight surgeon's office when we happened to glance up and saw an object that was heard in the control tower to be 
a weather balloon. In the same [REDACTED] was brought to our attention.
It was a peculiar incident. One object was certainly [REDACTED]
and upon [REDACTED]. It seems that the altitude of weather balloon
upon further observation lowered, or dropped to a estimated to be roughly 5,000 to 10,000 feet that approximately one mile.
Later two [REDACTED] objects were noted to close proximity. Almost 
immediately, one object resorted rapidly to the north east apparently

Please note that due to the quality of the photocopy and the presence of redaction (black bars blocking text), this is an incomplete and partially unclear transcription. The document herself, due to the nature of these redactions and quality, leaves gaps and uncertainties in the content.

The image contains what appears to be a photo of a page with a photograph or illustration. In the photograph or illustration, there is an object that could be interpreted as a classic "flying saucer" shapeâ€”a horizontally elongated, somewhat cylindrical or disk-like object with a smaller dome on top. There are various annotations on the paper; however, the quality and resolution of the image may prevent accurate text recognition.

As for acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition), due to the quality of the scan, the text is not legible enough to accurately transcribe. Any attempt to do so would likely lead to significant errors. If you can provide a clearer image or additional context, I may be able to offer more assistance.

The image appears to be a photocopy of an old report page with two hand-drawn illustrations at the top. These are simple line drawings that appear to depict two aerial objects, one looks like a classic "flying saucer" shape, and the other is less distinct. There are arrows and notations next to these illustrations. Now, as requested, I will replicate the text from the document:

---
(4)     o    In approximately 2 minutes objects had disappeared

          o     Objects began moving in a NNE direction and rapidly accelerating
                   and climbing.

(3)     o     When first seen objects were in a semi-stationary position.

(2)     o     When first seen objects were in a semi-stationary position.

(1)     o     First one object was sighted, next, another one appeared.

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sightings of unidentified flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the files of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and reconnaissance as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routing synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except that the United States Weather Bureau's "world incidents" which are sightings made from projects in which balloons are used and on which all conclusions or sponsorship by Army, Navy or United States Air Force are ambiguous or the intelligence content of the commands. These shops are annually made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, MCIAAO-3. These shops are distant from the shops of synoptic balloon flights made by weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce. (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed incidents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining incidents are balloons.

Investigations by this headquarters reveal that a synoptic

were reported in the following incidents. In compiling this
list consideration was given to the wind directions and speed at
the surface and aloft at the scheduled time of balloon release, and
the location of the nearest weather station making balloon obser-

Witnesses were attracted by sound of fighter aircraft in vicinity.
They started searching the sky for the aircraft and sighted the
objects. From first sighting, the witnesses thought object might
be weather balloons. However, when they accelerated so rapidly in
a northerly heading, they determined the object could not be balloons.
They were in a trail formation on a north-south line and several
miles they went out of sight within a few seconds. From one 
rapid change in the southerly position to their disappearance, a period
of approximately two (2) minutes elapsed, during which time objects were
in a stationary position for approximately one (1) minute.

NOTE: Wind at 20,000 ft from 340Â° at 120 knots per hour (1230 EST Rpt)
      Wind at 20,000 ft 320Â° at 13 knots per hour at (1630 EST Rpt)

NOTE: Nearest weather station releasing balloons is Spartanburg, S. C.
