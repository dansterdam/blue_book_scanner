An unrecorded-by-RDO Ignition, 1 August 1949, while talking to Traffic Control Tower, port Columbus, Airport, --------- observed a strange small directly above the airport, which appeared to be an oval craft the size of a Ryan PT22 craft, not silver, colored, possibly as 30,000 feet and in a westerly direction. It was impossible to ascertaining, thereby eliminating a vane-type and confirming its manner distinctively for approximately two miles for ten minutes and then made a turn for approximately ten minutes to the north west and at intervals diminished in sharp and size to that it to picture and a rolled journal for ten minutes, its velocity slower, tall silhouettes experiences therefore may be following features during the time interval indicated in this report, which may him been caused by a common similar to Juno (Not assigned to Port Columbus) or air turbulence behind such a craft, assumed that the yellow two-man or one-man trail to be a "contrail" because of its density and color. This trail was described as parallel to and swooping to intersect did not obstruct the ability to see contrails had just occurred. no propeller craft could this distance concurrently and traveled through so full nor of apparently parallel to known accompli. it was noticeable that it was visible. Soon after two to three thousand horsepower, a "V" type was observed in the sky at about 30,000 to 35,000 feet, trailing over Hamilton and Norris look direct at the southwest corner of the airport, and intersection in a northwesterly direction. was expected to travel toward the horizon in a northwesterly direction.

Port Columbus Tower contacted the pilot of a Trans-world Airlines plane, en route to Dayton, the pilot advised for this observation on the 14th. it is reported that two pilots gave his position an error to start Jefferson, this relative to his evidence 90 miles away from the intersection even though more planes en route this vicinity, had a window by seconds from the ----- ---- to seconds from the ----- was transmitted the course to the intersection of the CO, to the CC, route. the course to the intersection to Shreveport to the intersection to Fort Worth, still visible aircraft at time more of a liquid type, and the light described was still visible at that time.

AGENT REPORT

On 2 August 1949, ............................, Airport Traffic Control employee, 
177 North Nelson Road, Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed concerning the sighting
of an unidentified object in the sky, and stated in substance:

At approximately 1345, 1 August 1949, at the Air Traffic Control Tower, Port Columbus Airport, Columbus, Ohio, when I received informa-
tion via the telephone call had been received from David Peel, an employee at
Port Columbus, Ohio, stating that he had observed and was still observing an
object in the sky, and asking if we at the tower could identify the object.
I proceeded to step on my fire-escapr, at the tower, to view the object.
Our visibility at our field at that time of day, was 15 to 20 miles in the 
rural horizon, however, in a westerly direction where the object was 
reported to be approximately five to seven miles, and was dissipating as 
high as the aircraft. I called the Control Tower at Lockbourne Air 
Force Base, Tessie Jogol, Governor, Ohio, to ascertain if they had a plane, 
foroign or otherwise in the air with the could be mistaken for this: and likewise
to ascertain if they had any aircraft aloft that a C-47 traveling northwest, was in
the air, and I was told by the tower man to contact our tower and aircraft in 
the sky from our C-47 to a B-29 in flight, which was currently in the air and in
our objective from us. I do not know in terms of this flight, so I contacted him 
via VHF telephone, this man was the nearest air traffic control tower 
177 North Nelson Road, Columbus, Ohio, to Columbus Tower to find out if he
had in the least, two fighters to send me to see and observe and follow
the object to ascertain the character of this object; no fighters were in the
area nor were. He told me to go to the Air Force Reserve Center to locate a 
Reserve aircraft, I did observe that what at first I thought were vortices, con-
tracool as straight lines and not curly. (See co- or serving made by 
normal). These со-like lines disappeared and at 1142, a plane; these lines was from 
my location in the tower. His direction was very bright and clearly felt toward 
the horizon in a northwesterly direction. The object disappeared on the hori-
zon at approximately 2120 hours, and as it disappeared the light turned yellow 
and then red.

4. REPORT OF FINDINGS

On 2 August '49, the following article concerning the sighting of 
unconventional aircraft was published in the Ohio State "Journal," Columbus, Ohio:

"Venus, either that or it all

"Planetary ruins & ink blinks"

"In a distorted city, seeing 'space ships' not of mysterious objects in the
sky, all probability is mistaken," the two bright objects in color in the 
for flying saucers craft. It was the considered opinion of authorities at 
the local observatory on the campus of Ohio State University last night, still
the so the Air force was sufficiently curious and investigative to send observers 
aloft.

"Telephone calls/comments at The Ohio State "Journal" and police headquarters, 
as well as the weather mission at 'port' Columbus, increased with inquiries about 
the strange spectacles.

"....those blinking, color, replicate spray in the adornment at the .. observatory, 
while Venus is the she was more or less conclusively judged a planet Venus, 
though official report said only, "what the..."... bright object the eastern 
skies, they both burst southeast, also what it the more scared the 
blinks with a silver bright brilliance, had pass about...."

"Venus was the best bet for those who saw a color-ful in the west just before 
dark, noticed a new dim tail, then a bright illumination a star." Venus is 
visible to longer far, evening brightly than most to about 0220 PM."

"Air Force observation planes took off from Lockbourne and Patterson Field 
to "travel into the 'great circle," but pilots reported "it looks like a star."

"Two "death 2200 hours ended" as objects over the city light, and noticed a 
far away time only far east as it decreased slowly; until it was obscured by the 
horizon.... calculations find a cloud could have been 10-15 more 'whmsy bird'
when it disappeared, Venus' light would shine "like a headlight."

"No western object was seen by "men in the port Columbus control tower, who 
reported last night. No air cleared moon admitted was there," the objects was seen.

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):
Agent's Note:

On 15 August 1949, the following information concerning the sighting of
unidentified aircraft was obtained from a University *****************
TC Reserve,********* student of Ohio State University, **************
Ohio ******************** Columbus, Ohio

At approximately 1900 hours, 15 August 1949, while visiting the Traffic
Control Tower, Port Columbus Airport, Campbell observed a smoke trail directly
above the airport, which appeared to be caused from an unseen object flying at
very high altitude, estimated as 30,000 to 70,000, in a westerly direction.
The trail was described as cushion; abrubtly at not maximum intensity and con-
tinuing at maximum intensity for approximately two-thirds its length and then
fading away. According to Campbell, the trail was visible for about fifteen
seconds and that the source of the smoke seemed to increase its velocity during
this time. The phenomena was described by informant as resembling a smoke trail
issuing from a high speed plane, which may have been using a device similar to
JATO (Jet Assisted Take Off) for an additional burst of speed. Informant did not
believe the vapor or smoke trail to be a "contrail" because of its density and
color. The trail was described as greyish-white, and according to informant
did not dissipate as rapidly as contrails he has observed. Informant estimated
that the object emitting the trail traveled through a angle of approximately
fifteen degrees in; ten-fifteen seconds which would be an So an earth to
smoke trail disappeared, a light was observed in the sky at about 50,000 to
60,000 feet, directly over the Outerbelt, right at the southwest corner of
the airfield. The light remained motionless for a short time and then appeared
to travel toward the horizon in a northerly direction. ************* stated
that the Port Columbus tower contacted the pilot of a Trans-world Airlines DC-3
enroute to Dayton, Ohio and asked for his observations on the light. It
reported that the pilot gave his position as over the West Jefferson, Ohio radio
ran on a - that the pilot gave his position as eight . from left to right at
an altitude estimated at 10,000 to 50,000 feet. The path of radiant the course
on the Dayton bound plane as 265 degrees at the time the report was made.
Informant left the Control Tower, Port Columbus airport at 2015 hours 1 august
1949, and the lit described was still visible at that time. (C-6)
Agent's Note:
a thoughtful, straightforward statement that he has seen flight training and
considers aircraft as a hobby. Mr. Sewood to be describing; what he had seen in
report of the incident as carried in the local press is attached to this report.

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observor(s):

On 2 August 1949, ██████████████, Airport Traffic Control employee,
                ██████, Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed concerning the sight-
ing of an unidentified object in the sky, and stated in substance: 

NARRATIVE: At approximately 1045, 1 August 1949, I was on duty at the Traffic Con-
trol Tower, Port Columbus airport, Columbus, Ohio, when I received informa-
tion from a telephonic call had been received from ██████
                  ██████ Columbus, Ohio, stating that he (██████) had sighted an unidentified
object in the sky, and asking if we at the tower could identify this object.  
I searched the sky and saw what appeared, at first, to be vapor trails at 
approximately thirty or forty thousand feet, eighty to eighty-five degrees
off the horizon, traveling in a westerly direction.  These vapor trails
appeared to be approximately five degrees long, and were so being dissipated às
fast as they appeared.  I called the Traffic Control tower at Lockbourne Air
Force Base, Hayes Road, Groveport, Ohio, to ascertain if they had a plane,
either available or in the air, which could be used to track and identify
the object.  I was told by them none had a T-6, training; aircraft, was in
the air and they would instruct the pilot to contact our tower and await in-
structions from us.  I do not know the name of this pilot; he identified him-
self only the number six when we in contact with him ,he stated that he
was over Springfield, Ohio, at ten thousand feet, and could see a bright
light in the west.  He further stated he was holding a steady course on the
light and it appeared to him to be a star.  He did not state whether he could
see vapor trails.  Prior to the time the Port Columbus Tower had contacted the
T-6 aircraft, I had observed that what at first I thought were vapor trails,
appeared as straight lines and not curly.  (See copy of drawing made by
████████).  These smoke lines disappeared and a light appeared due west from
my location in the tower.  This light was very bright and slowly fell toward
the horizon in a northeasterly direction.  The light disappeared on the hori-
zon at approximately 2100 hours, and as it disappeared the light turned yellow
and then red.                                                     (B-6)
