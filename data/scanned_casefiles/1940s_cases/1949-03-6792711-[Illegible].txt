The image provided appears to be a reproduction of a scanned document, and it does not contain any photographs. It shows a diagram or sketch possibly related to the observation of an object, perhaps in the context of the UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is quite faint and not entirely legible due to the quality of the scan. However, I will transcribe what is discernible:

- "MAR 7"
- Several instances of the date "7 MAR" are scattered near the edges of the diagram.
- The diagram includes labels such as "NO. 8", "NO. 7", and "NO. 6".
- There are annotations that seem to describe angles or directions, but most of the text is not clear enough to read accurately.

Please note that the quality of the scan makes it challenging to transcribe all the text with certainty, and parts of it may not be correct or entirely legible.

The image does not contain a photograph of any recognizable subjects; instead, it appears to be a technical drawing or diagram with annotations and measurements. The image quality is quite poor, which makes the text difficult to decipher. However, I will provide the text that can be identified to the best of the ability:

- 7 Min

- NO. OF OBS. 1 A/C [There might be more text following "A/C" but it is unreadable]
- AZ 190° ELEV 6°
- AZ 151° - 147° ELEV 6°
- [There are several annotations related to angles and elevations like "27° ELEV" and "17° ELEV", but they are incomplete and not fully legible.]

Please note that due to the low resolution and quality of the image, exact transcription is challenging, and some of the text may not have been captured accurately.

- page 18 -

Sorry, the image is not clear enough for me to accurately transcribe the text. Can you provide a clearer image or zoom in on the text you'd like transcribed?

- page 19 -

The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather it appears to be a scanned page from an old document featuring a table filled with text and numerical data. The text and details on the document are mostly illegible due to the low resolution and quality of the scan. The header contains the text "U.S. AIR FORCE" and "SURFACE", and the top right corner seems to have a page number or identifier ("92- –") and potentially some handwritten text. The rest of the document mainly consists of columns with headers that are difficult to discern, possibly including dates, times, case numbers, observations, and other categorizations relating to the logging activity of the project.

Unfortunately, because of the image's quality, transcribing the entire content accurately is not feasible. If you need detailed information from this document, you may want to consider finding a higher resolution image or referencing the physical document or an official digital repository, where a clearer version may be available.

There's also a handwritten note with an arrow pointing to the textual description of the shape in section 7b. It says "Red" and "White" with lines pointing to different parts of a sketched object, implying different colors at the leading and trailing edges of the object described.

The photograph present in the document appears to be very dark and is of low quality, making it difficult to discern specific details. There is a faint, grainy image that resembles a beam of light or an elongated object in the center, set against a dark background that might represent the night sky or space.

Regarding the text in the document, the quality of the image provided is too poor for optical character recognition, and the text is not legible. I am unable to transcribe the text from this document as requested. If you have a higher quality image or can provide more context, I'll do my best to help.

                                          REPORT OF INFORMATION

DATE: 13 March 1949

OFFICE OF THE AC OF S, G-2, Headquarters Fourth Army, Fort Sam Houston, Texas

SUBJECT: UNUSUAL LIGHTS
(152.1 ALRAD)

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

   Eight moving "lights" appeared in the atmosphere over or in the vicinity
of the "Q" area, ASTP, Camp Hood, Texas, on the evening of 17 March 1949.
At the time of these sightings, the alert guard of the 2nd Armored Division,
under the Assistant AC of S, G-2 at Camp Hood, was in the area concerned and
prepared to fire at these and record subsequent readings of elevation and azimuth.
The purpose was to check the powers of observation of "B" observation and
previously reported possible phenomena observed on 6-7-8 March 1949 and heretofore
reported in Summary of Information, this headquarters, dated 17 March 1949.
Subjects "Humanoid Lights." However, before this operation could be begun,
the series of 8 unusual "lights" appeared.

Coordinates of lights and time of sighting follows

Coordinates                              Time
1. 910d40 - 855d54                      1952
2. 910d39 - 860d13                      1958
3. 910d42 - 860d14                      1958
4. 910d38 - 860d15                      2000
5. 910d32 - 857d20                      2000
6. 910d30 - 859d17                      2008
7. 910d36 - 855d06                      2024
8. 910d37 - 855d35                      2152

Coordinates were based on dual sightings of each lights by sights on tanks
of observers. Time was clocked at instant of sighting. Captain McCullough,
the Assistant G-2, personally observed three of the lights. Physical character-
istics of these "lights" were reported as "quite different" from those reported
on 6-7-8 March 1949. One burst into a green cluster. One was reddish, another
white. One observer described some of them as similar to "Very Pistol" flares.
While this phenomena was occurring, a security detachment from the "Q" area
arrived in the vicinity of the alert crew from the 2nd Armored Division.

Investigations of whole area by ground crews is being made and additional reports will be rendered. As it the case of the 6/7 March “lights,” those of the 17th “emanated” 4500 meters One fourth of 3 lights being North of the area and One group of 5 lights just South of the area.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
Eight moving "lights" appeared in the atmosphere over or in the vicinity of the "R" area, AFSWP, Camp Hood, Texas, on the evening of 17 March 1949. At the time of these sightings, the alert guard of the 2nd Armored Division, under the Assistant AC of S, G-2 of Camp Hood, was in the area concerned and prepared to fire flares and record instrument readings of elevation and azimuth. The purpose was to check the powers of observation of observers who had previously reported the phenomena observ on 6-7 March 1949 and heretofore reported in Summary of Information, this headquarters, dated 17 March 1949, subject "Unusual Lights." However, before this attention could be begun, the series of 8 unusual "lights" appeared.

Coordinates of lights and time of sightings follow:

Coordinates                         Time
1.   910.40 - 855.11h               1952
2.   910.39 - 860.13                1956
3.   910.42 - 860.11                1956
4.   910.38 - 860.15                2000
5.   910.32 - 855.20                2020
6.   910.30 - 855.17                2010
7.   910.36 - 855.06                2020
8.   910.37 - 855.35                2152

Coordinates were based on dual sightings of each light by sights on tanks or observers. Time was clocked at instant of sighting. Captain McCullough, the Assistant G-2, personally observed three of the lights. Physical characteristics of the "lights" were recorded as "quite different" from those reported on 6-7 March 1949. No bursts nor smoke was visible. No vessels in the vicinity, no other plane-like objects in sight (at an altitude too vary pistol flares). While this phenomena was occurring, 3 security detachments from the "R" area arrived in the vicinity of the crew from the 2nd Armored Division.
