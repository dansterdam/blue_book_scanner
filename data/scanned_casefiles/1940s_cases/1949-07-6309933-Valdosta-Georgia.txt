AGENT'S NOTES.

Mrs. [redacted] is a woman of approximately 65 or 70 years old, 
residing with her daughter and caring for her daughter's home. She is 
easily led during interrogations anu has a very vague idea of exactly 
the color, position and shape of the object which she saw. Though it 
is believed that Mrs. [redacted] is trustworthy, this Agent agrees with 
other residents of that vicinity that she is excitable and has a great 
amount of imagination.
