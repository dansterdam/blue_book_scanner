SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

Reference is made to Par 2, Summary of Information, this office,
subject same as above, dated 29 October 1949. The following additional information
is furnished in regards to the interview with Mrs. Minnie Lytle: Mrs. Lytle stated
that the objects were approximately twenty-four (24) inches in circumference; that
the position of the objects in flight was in the horizontal position with the nose
forward; that there was no evidence of propellors on either of the objects, and that
both objects appeared to be perfectly straight with no tapers or curves. Mrs. Lytle
explained that her estimate of the dimensions of the objects was based on their
appearance aloft and not their actual sizes. (E-2)

On 1 November 1949, this office was informed by an official of Security 
Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that the officials of the
Weather Station of Plant “K-25”, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, report that one (1)
thirty-two (32) inch weather balloon was released at that station every hour,
approximately on the hour from 0600 to 2400, on 27 October 1949, but that no other
meteorological instruments were released on that date. (B-2)

Gentlemen

On Oct 27, about 12:30 o'clock P.M. I was in my yard when I happened
to look up and saw something in the sky coming from the North. There were
two of them—each one of them was two oval shaped objects. The ovals were
fastened together with a fastener that seemed to be flexible. They were
high and going fast. They shined brightly like net aluminum would in the
sunlight. The fastener shined like the oval objects. I could see the
fastener bag between the ovals when they changed position. They would
fly. One oval over the other one a few seconds with the fastener in a
vertical position between the crimnis. Then they would change again. The
fastener would be in a horizontal position. The ovals appeared to be
about one foot in size to me. The fastener seemed to be about one inch
wide.

I could see them plainly as it was clear and bright in the north,
east, and south that day.

They made no sound. I had been looking at them a minute or two
when one of them seemed to jar or jerb then it vanished the other one
went on south. In a minute, or a half minute something resembling
pieces of ashes came down. It was drifting lightly in the wind, it
seemed to be lighter in weight than ashes from the way it floated in
the wind. It was a whitish color. It was coming from the north towards
the south;some of the pieces were half as large as a feather. Most of
them were much smaller. I saw one piece six or seven inches long, I
started to get the large piece. It was about ten feet high it looked
like it would come on down in a minute. I was following the large
piece intending to get it when it came down. I happened to look towards
my barn which was north of where I was standing. The e was something
like spider web coming down. It was coming from the north. They
were coming down fast and think they were catching on the leaves of the
trees. Thereon Places were thick with them. There were millions of
them, the air seemed to be full of them. Single strands shining in the
sunlight. They had a Golden tint. There were some pieces that seemed
to be large pieces of spider web that had tangleed together. Some of the
pieces had a long tail of single strands with heavy pieces at one end.
Theheavy end would lift the piece up, and let it down. It seemed to be
controlling it.

The large pieces were gray-white, like common spider web. They
seemed to be much lighter in weight from the way they floated in the
wind. Some of the pieces were fairly large to stay up like they did.

In about ten minutes I saw another oval coming from the east. It
was a single oval. It was only an ovel shaped object. It was going

faster than the ovals I had seen fastened together. It seemed about a
foot in size. It would turn the end in the direction it was going. In
3 or 4 seconds the side would turn in that direction. It did not turn
all the way around. It just seemed to swing half way around. It had
passed overhead. I saw it jar, seemed like it stopped. I thought it
was going to change its course, but it did not. A small bright some-
thing shot from the oval. It went southeast. It went much faster 
than the oval. It was about the size of a large star. It was bright
like a star. It was not large enough for me to see the shape it was.

I looked from the star-like object back to where the oval was.
It had vanished. I did not see it again.

In a minute the stuff like ashes was drifting among the trees.
It seemed to be coming down. I did not see a piece come to the ground.
I thought it was landing on the leaves. Then something like spider
web came down when it came down in the open I could see it go to the
ground in the trees it caught on the leaves and shined. I could see
it hanging in the trees.

When I looked up again there was another one of the ovals; it
was going in a southwest direction. I did not see what direction it
came from. It was overhead when I saw it. It seemed to fravel about
a half way around and then back. I saw it jar and jerk like the
other one did. Then the star-like object shot from the oval. It went
in a southeast direction very fast. It was some distance from the
large oval. Bright things no larger than single strands of spider
web came from each side of the large oval. They came from the oval at a 
curve. They were so bright and so many of them it hurt my eyes to look
at them. There seemed to be millions coming from the oval. They shined
like spider web in the sun. In a moment after it has gone another
looked like flakes of ashes, were coming down. They were like the other
pieces I had seen. Then the spider web stuff came down. It looked like 
Xmas decoration on the trees where it came down in the open. I could see
it after it got to the ground. It seemed like it covered everything
as far as I could see there was as much shining web as there would be
rain in a big rain. All the afternoon the single ovals went over. I
would see one every ten or fifteen minutes. They were single ovals. I
did not see any more fastened together. They came from the east and
north.

While I was watching it a plane was coming from the west. That
the plane was not very far from the oval, I saw the oval jar or jerk
the star-like object shot from the oval, it went west. I looked at the
plane to see if it would change course or speed as it was not very high
the oval. I hoped the pilot would see the oval, but the plane did not
change speed. I looked back to where the oval was but did not see it

again, it had vanished.

At 3 o'clock I looked up again. There were two of the ovals
almost overhead. Each one of them had a tail not anything like a plane,
just a shining, something that looked to be about one inch wide to me.
It was flexible. I could see it plainly. The ovals were going over
each other, the aeround each other, then one of them would go under the
other one as they moved. I could plainly see that each one of them had a
tail. I watched them maybe 3 mintues, while I watched, I decided they
were trying to get in position to hitch together. If those tails had
been fastened together they would be exactly like the first ones I saw
coming from the North. I did not watch to see which way they went. I
had to meet the school bus. My daugter come home about 3 o'clock. We
watched for ovals and saw 3 or 4 after she got home. All of them came
from the east. They were single ovals.

The ashes and spider web stuff came drifting after each one
of them passed, it went on until about 4:30 o'clock.

We got one small piece of the web. It seems to be nothing but
common spider web. I am sending it with the letter. Not much but the
webs were gone from the trees. It was just like nothing had happened.

I told my daughter to listen at school to find out if any one
else saw the ovals. She said there was no talk of anyone seeing anything.

So far as I know my daughter and I were the only ones that say
them. On Nov 1st about 1 o'clock, I looked up and saw another one of
the ovals. It was going south a few cluds of the same ashes stuff and
spider web came drifting down from the north. It seemed like I could
taste a bitter taste in my mouth, the bitter taste seemed to go on from
in my throat. I could not get rid of the bitter taste in my mouth and throat
for 2 days.

On Oct 27th when I saw the ovals, I tasted that bitter taste in
my mouth. That day I thought perhaps I imagined the bitter taste, because
I was scared. The ovals, ashes and webs frightened me.

But after I saw that one on Nov 1st, and tasted the bitter taste
again, I knew I had not imagined it. I live in northeast Mississippi
about 25 miles northeast of Tupelo, Miss. If it will not be a lot of
bother, would you let me know if there were any rockers or something
like that still going on? It last till 9:30, until 12:30 on Oct 23rd when
I saw all I saw unitl afternoon, and please don't turn this over to the
papers. I do not wish to lead another flying saucer scare.

Yours truly

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

On 28 October 1949, THE KNOXVILLE N-E-S-S S-E-N-T-I-N-E-L carried an article which
stated that a Mrs. Winnie Lytle, Old Maryville Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, reported 
that about 1530 hours on 27 October 1949, she sighted two (2) bright looking objects
flying high and fast over her home. The newspaper quoted Mrs. Lytle as saying, that 
the objects were tube shaped, noiseless and about a yard in length, and that they
looked like airplanes when the sun shined on them.            (C-2)

On 28 October 1949, Mrs. Winnie Lytle, Housewife, Old Maryville Pike, Route
#3, Knoxville, Tennessee, was interviewed and stated that while standing in her
back yard at approximately 1530 hours, 27 October 1949, she sighted two (2) objects
which were flying toward the South (180 degrees) at approximately the same altitude
and speed as commercial type aircraft. She said that she first sighted the first object 
by coincidence while looking up at the sky. Then she first sighted the object it
was directly overhead, and was flying in a level flight. She said that the object
was shaped like a straight tube, and that no openings either in the side or rear
were visible. There was no evidence of vapor trails or exhaust, nor was there any
sound from the object. The informant said that she kept this object in sight for 
approximately one (1) minute before it disappeared from her vision in approximately 
a forty-five (45) degree angle. Mrs. Lytle continued by saying that immediately 
after the first object disappeared, she again looked overhead and sighted another 
object, which was identical to the first one in shape and size, and that it was
flying at the same altitude, in the same direction and at the same rate of speed 
as the first object. This object was also sighted for approximately one (1)
minute before it disappeared. The informant stated that from the reflection of the 
sun on these two objects, they appeared to be constructed of metal similar to that
used in airplanes. She said that the sky at the time was void of clouds. Mrs.
Lytle further stated that she was alone at the time the objects were sighted. (B-2)

AGE/SEX NEG: Mrs. Lytle is approximately fifty-five (55) years of age, and of
        about average intelligence. All her answers were made without hesitation.
        It is not believed to report the above incident to Headquarters by telephone 
        with negative results since the informant was not obtainable until about 1715, on
        28 October 1949, and no personnel were in the office at that time.

On 29 October 1949, Officials of the United States Weather Bureau, McGee-
Tyson Airport, Knoxville, Tennessee, were contacted and stated that weather balloons
were released by that Bureau on 27 October 1949, at 0405, 1000, 1602 and 2203; but
there were no other meteorological instruments were released. They said that the balloons
that no approximate velocity (30) inches in diameter, and that the color of the first 
balloon was red, the second was orange, the third was yellow and fourth was orange.
The officials furnished the following information relative to winds aloft on 27
October 1949:

again it had vanished.

At 3 o'clock I looked up again. There were two of the ovals 
almost overhead. Each one of them had a tail not anything like a plane,
just a shinning something that looked to be about one inch wide to me.
It was flexible, I could see it plainly. The ovals were going over
each other, then around each other then one of them would go under the
other one as they moved I could plainly see it each one of them had a
tail. I watched them maybe 3 minutes, while I watched, I decided they
were trying to get in position to hitch together. If those tails had
been fastened together they would be exactly like the first ones I saw
coming from the North. I did not watch to see which way they went. I 
had to meet the school bus. My duaghter [sic] come home about 3 o' clock. We
watched for ovals and saw 3 or 4 after she got home. All of them came
from the east. They were single ovals.

The ashes and spider web stuff came drifting. After each one
of them passed, it went on until about 4\30 o'clock.

We got one small piece of the web. It seems to be nothing but the
common spider web. I am sending it with the letter. Next morning the
webs were gone from the trees. It was just like nothing had happened.

I told my daughter to listen at school to find out if anyone
else saw the ovals. She said there was no talk of anyone seeing anything.

So far as I know my daughter and I were the only ones that saw
them. On Nov 1st about 1 o'clock, I looked up and saw another one of
the ovals. It was going south. A few flakes of the ashes stuff and
spider web came drifting down from the north. It seemed like I could
taste a bitter taste in my mouth, the bitter taste seemed to go on down
in my throat. I could not get rid of the bitter in my mouth and throat
for 2 days.

On Oct 27th when I saw the ovals, I tasted that bitter taste in 
my mouth. That day I thought perhaps I imagined the bitter taste, because

like that streaking over northeast Miss. that day. I was scared when
I saw all I saw that afternoon, and please don't turn this over to the
