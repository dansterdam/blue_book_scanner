altitude and directly over the Urbana, Ohio Airport, he sight what at first
appeared to be a rocket powered guided missile. However, on taking a second
look, .................. stated it appeared to be a mere like body. The object

bank which was building up to the northwest. It was generally round in shape,
a bright orange ball, with a tail of flare which was mixed orange and blue and
a pale blue at the trailing end. When first seen the object was about 150 to

Major **** has flown for approximately two thousand hours over a period of ten years. He has witnessed the firing of such rockets as the JB-2 on V-1, and the M6 CPL. The Major's hobbies are flying, photography, and sports.

4. On 29 June 1949, this agent, accompanied by Mr. ****, interviewed Mr. **** at approximately 2145 on the evening of 20 June 1949 while sitting on his lawn at the above listed address with a neighbor six facing north, he observed a large ball of orange flame which appeared to be five feet in diameter with a tail of about twenty feet. The object was first sighted just above a large tree directly north of Mr. **** home and at an angle of about 30° above the ground. Neither Mr. **** nor his neighbor detected any odor or sound other than the noise of a small plane which was flying a few seconds before he had been looking to the south. The object appeared to pass between the plane and **** and also above the plane. The object was visible for only a few seconds and disappeared behind the house next door, by the time Mr. **** could call his neighbor's attention to it.

5. On 24 June 1949, this writer, accompanied by Mr. ****, interviewed Mrs. **** at the Play Grounds of the Charles L. Loos School, Wampler Road and Columbia Place, Dayton, Ohio, where she frequently takes her children in the neighborhood to play. She stated she was here at the play grounds on the afternoon of the 26 June 1949 when at approximately 5:45 she observed an apparent ball of fire passing above the trees surrounding the play grounds. The ball appeared silver in color, round in shape and somewhat "m" shaped in front. It had a fiery tail which she stated was a mixture of all colors. The ball appeared no sounds other than that of a plane circling overhead at the time. **** stated that next school season she will be a Freshman in High School.
