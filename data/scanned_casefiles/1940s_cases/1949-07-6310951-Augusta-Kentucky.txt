Mr. █████████
Augusta, Kentucky

Dear █████████:

Receipt of your communication, dated 26 July 1949, is respectfully acknowledged by this Headquarters.

While the information submitted does not contain sufficient detail to enable a positive identification, a marked similarity exists between the appearance of a searchlight beam and the phenomenon reported. Searchlights capable of projecting a beam in the manner described are often employed at carnivals, fairs, and other public gatherings.

Your action in writing this Headquarters regarding this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

W. R. CLINGMAN
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Analysis Division
Intelligence Department

```
Augusta, Ky, July 26,

Sir: Would be glad if the
"lightning in the sky"
last evening were natural
lights; maybe it was a-
tall weeping willow
of light, the hebst kind of
bomb Wright field.
We are 45 miles
up the Ohio river from
Cincinnati.
               --
Augusta
