The text in the document reads:

---

Incident #72 -- Alaska -- 1947 (exact date not known)

From the scanty information available, it appears im-
probable that this object was astronomical, unless the report
represents a highly garbled and subjective account of a daylight
meteor. (The time of the sighting is not given, but it is assumed
from the description of the incident that it occurred during day-
light hours.)

It should be noted as a matter of general record that some
of the reports received at observatories of recognized fireballs
falls are so highly colored and garbled that if the astronomer did
not have independent evidence of the identity of the object, it
would be impossible to determine from these reports.

TO: Commanding General, Air Material Command, Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: TECIXAS

Investigations by this headquarters reveal that a synoptic
weather balloon could have been at the location where sightings
were reported in the following incidents. In compiling this
list consideration was given to the wind direction and speed at
the surface and aloft at the scheduled time of balloon release, and
the location of the nearest weather station making balloon obser-
vations.

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
Andrews Air Force Base,
Washington 25, D. C.
ATTN: DCS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investi-
gation and interpretation of data relative to sighting of unidentified
flying objects. Attached hereto are surveys to thru 12 from the files
of Project "SIGN" as forwarded for study and interpretation as to
which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine
synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological
Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached
may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that
has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except
that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on bal-
loon flights. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are
conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are
checked by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks
normally made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, MCLAKO-3. These
checks are distinct from the check of synoptic balloon flights made by
weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department
of Commerce. (U. S. Weather Bureau) requests of Air Weather Service,

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed inci-
dents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This
list does not eliminate the possibility that any of the remaining
incidents are balloons.
