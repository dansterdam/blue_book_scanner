The image contains two photographs. The first photograph appears to be a black and white image of an unidentified flying object or anomaly, with a rectangular shape and some texture or markings on the surface; it is shown against a blank background. The second photograph shows a similar or the same object, displayed with an arrow indicating a direction, possibly suggesting motion of the object.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #148 -- Springfield, Ohio -- 23 July 1948

The planet Venus seems to be the culprit in this incident.
Venus attained its greatest brilliancy in the morning sky on July 31,
and at approximately 0400 in the morning of July 23, it was a very
brilliant object slightly to the north of east. Its magnitude was -4.2,
which makes it about 100 times brighter than a first magnitude star.
Intermittent cloud coverage could easily explain the appearance and
disappearance of the object, and as to the stated size, this can be
dismissed as a purely subjective estimate. The evidence appears
convincing to this investigator that the object observed was Venus.

The photograph in the document appears to be a small, somewhat blurry black and white image situated near the top left corner. It seems to show a circular or elliptical object with a lighter center and a darker outline or border. Perhaps due to the quality and age of the image, it is not possible to make out fine details or provide a confident assessment of what the photograph depicts.

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,

Washington 25, D. C.
ATTN: DCS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sightings of unidentified flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the files of Project SIGN are forwarded for study and recommendations as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are channeled by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks are usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, MXCIAO-3. These checks are distinct from the check of synoptic balloon flights made by weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce. (S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office, that the below listed incidents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining incidents are balloons.

Investigations by this headquarters reveal that a synoptic
weather balloon could have been at the location where sightings
were reported in the following two incidents. In compiling this
list consideration was given to the wind direction and speed at
the surface and aloft at the scheduled time of balloon release, and
the location of the nearest weather station making balloon obser-
vations.
