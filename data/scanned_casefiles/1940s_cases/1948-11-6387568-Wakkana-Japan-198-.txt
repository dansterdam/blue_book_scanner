The document appears to be a military communication and mentions various control numbers, dates, and terms that would be relevant in the context of the Project Blue Book reports on unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The overlapping handwritten notes are not completely legible, but seem to reference filing and routing information like "File in" with "HQ USAF" and have a number that seems to resemble "842442."

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters; AC/IAS, dated 19 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The Incident Summaries 173 through 233 have been checked against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigations of Unidentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows:  Item 13, "Division of Flight of Objects," should be clarified so that vertical and horizontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move. "Relative to Radar Spotting" should include a statement of the type of radar set used.

...ident: 193

Target appeared in ground clutter area during entire period of observation. 
Target was not observed in station area, and was not observed visually at
any time. At times the target appeared as 2 aircraft and at other times 
as a singe aircraft. Gave impression of 2 fighter craft dog-fighting.
Evaluated as Soviet aircraft conducting electronic reconnaissance mission.
Thought to be a Soviet "ferret" since the object was computed to have held
a speed of 240 MPH and since the size of blip on radar scope was normal
for an aircraft. The unidentified aircraft circled (20 mile radius)
continuously for one hour and fifty minutes immediately above radar site
installed at Wakkana, No authorized aircraft was in the vicinity.
Weather conditions precluded visual observation.

1. Reference is made to TWX from Commanding General, Far Eastern Air Force, 8 November 1948. See attached inclosure.

2. It is requested that the reporting agency be contacted through the most expeditious channels to obtain the following additional information:

   a. At first radar reading of target aircraft, what was its altitude, azimuth, speed and heading?

   b. Did readings vary as target approached station - were radar evasion tactics employed?

   c. Size of blip on scope in comparison to that of known aircraft.

   d. Did target enter a station ground clutter area?
   
   e. After leaving station ground clutter area was target again observed? What was altitude, azimuth, speed and heading of target while departing, and at what range was target lost?

   f. Was aircraft observed visually or heard at any time? If so, what were details, (configurations) of aircraft.

   g. Type sequences of local weather and winds aloft report at time of radar detection.

   h. List of known aircraft or testing devices aloft in the vicinity at the time. Check of all local military installations.

   i. Any further information that may seem helpful in determining type of aircraft, its mission and whether its origin is foreign or domestic.
