The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object appears to be an elongated shape with blurred edges, possibly due to motion or camera shake. It stands out against a blank sky, and there are no other distinguishable features or reference points to determine its size or distance.

'SAUCER' VIEWED NEAR TILLAMOOK

TILLAMOOK, Jan. 24 (Special - The flying saucers are back.

Mr. and Mrs. Burt Leedington, driving south on hiway 101 at 11:05
a.m. Sunday, saw a silvery object in the sky above them at an
elevation of about 2000 feet, they reported.

Mrs. Leedington first discovered the object, about one quarter mile
southeast of Pleasant Valley. She called her husband's attention to
it and they watched it as they drove slowly to the store at Pleasant
Valley.

There the store operator, Allen Hughes, went with Leedington to ob-
serve it, but by that time it had disappeared. A check of the airport
here indicated that a yellow plane was the only one in the air at the
time.

Mrs. Leedington described the object as round and silvery. She said she
could not tell whether it was moving.

Case #24-20

DETAILS:

1. Investigation predicated upon request of 20 #5, Wright-
Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.

TILLAMOOK, OREGON

2. On 11 April 1949, Mr. ------------------------, occupation mecha-
nic, was interviewed at his repair shop beside Hughes Grocery and Filling
Station, Pleasant Valley, Oregon; and at his home at Rt. 2, Box 188,
Tillamook, Oregon. ------- stated that at about 1100 hours, 24 January
1949, while driving south on Highway 101 below the Naval Air Station,
which is approximately 7 or more miles south of Tillamook, Oregon, his atten-
tion was attracted to a shiny object glinting in the sun. The object
seemed to be stationary, was a silver color, and seemed to have no distinct
shape. The map coordinates show the place of observation as latitude 45°
22' 17", and the longitude as 123° 41' 12". His statement may be 2 to 4
degrees in error. The object was approximately NW to the object
through the windshield (which was clean) at a 30 degree angle
from the ground. It seemed to be about 1/2 to 3/4 inch in size from his
view point, and the elapsed time that he was able to observe was 2 to
3 or possibly 4 or 5 minutes, during which time the object seemed to be
stationary. About 1 mile forward, his view was obstructed by trees
Pleasant Valley, about 7 miles away, and when last seen it appeared to
disappear over the hills to the southwest, but did not drop suddenly. The
object, when first seen, was estimated to be about 1 or 1 1/2 miles
away from the observer, and his eyesight was stated to be about 20/20.
It did not seem to move its entire size of observation, had no sound or
odor (F5 questionnaire asks this ruling), and could not have been dis-
tinguished from its motor, and had its side exposed to the sun, the effect
on him rather awe inspiring from its brilliance compared to that of his
cab light he had on. The size from the way he saw it, about 1/8 or less
of an inch in diameter, and that it resembled a balloon or soap bubble.
The weather was pleasant, no ground haze, clear, very good light;
there was not seen any clouds in the sky, the sun was setting; the
witness, wife ROSE, later confirmed that their home at Rt. 2, Box
188, Tillamook, Oregon, was about a half mile from their

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

Appears quiet and reliable

___[redacted]___ SHOP, Mr. __[redacted]___, occupation machinist, was interviewed at his repair shop beside ___[redacted]___ Grocery and Filling Station, Pleasant Valley, Oregon, and at his home at __[redacted]___, Box 1684, Tillamook, Oregon. ___[redacted]___ stated that's about 1100 hours, 23 January 1949, while driving south on Highway 101 below the old Naval Air station, which is approximately four miles south of Tillamook, Oregon, his attention was attracted to a shiny object glinting in the sun. The object seemed to be stationary, was a silver color, and seemed to have no distinct shape. The map coordinate shown the place of observation as Latitude 45° 22' 17", and the longitude as 123° 55' 12". He observed the object through the windshield (which was clean) of his car at about a 35° angle from the ground. It seemed to be about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile from him to the southeast, and the altitude seemed to be about 500 feet. It was in view for about 2 1/2 or 3 minutes, during which time his observations to Pleasant Valley about 1/2 miles away, and when into his shop to get his binoculars. By the time he returned outside three to five minutes more, it did not return to nor was the noise heard of. He could not have seen or did (His automobile motor was running, and some- would not, had it been distinguished from the motor), and it also seemed to be about 12 or 15 feet in diameter. ___[redacted]___ states that the object was about the size of his open hand at arm's length from his eyes from where he saw it. It left no trail and did not maneuver, ___[redacted]___ compared its brilliance with the effect of the sun shining on a sheet of aluminum alloy and "not 1/2 and 1/2 the moon." The weather was pleasant, no sound haze, clear, very good light; no precipitation was not any clouds in the sky. The only witness with ___[redacted]___, was Mrs. __[redacted]___, who also viewed it from home as __[redacted]___, Box 1684, Tillamook, Oregon. She accounts date ___[redacted]___ their ___[redacted]___. It was noted by ___[redacted]___ those about ___[redacted]___ airplane maneuvers because of the map ____[redacted]___ with ___[redacted]___ was not in the area in question at that time, and it was ascertained because ___[redacted]___ had ___[redacted]___ at ___[redacted]___ air cadet base ___[redacted]___.

AGENT'S NOTE:
___[redacted]___ is believed by this agent that ___[redacted]___ and his wife did some objects in the sky, ___[redacted]___ airplanes that fly over, and the lack of any shape to the object, ___[redacted]___ saw, it could easily have been the plane shining in the sun. The plane drawing away from ___[redacted]___ would not seem to move, and the sound of the ___[redacted]___ automobile motor would drown out any sound of the plane.

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

Mr. ███████ is about 65 years old or over, wears thick spectacles, and is a 
little deaf. It is believed that he might have prepared the story so as to
regaling his daughter and her husband's feelings when people in the area
ridiculed the story in the newspaper.

On 11 April 1949, Mr. ██████ home of father of Mrs. █████████, Tillamook,
Oregon; where, with his wife, he lives in a small house to the rear of the
█████████ home, █████████ stated that at about 1100 hours on 21 January 1949
he was hanging his wife’s wash on the line behind his home. While putting
an article of clothing on the line, his attention was attracted to a silvery
disc the shape of a saucer and about the size of the full moon going directly
over his head in a definite northeast direction at an altitude of about 1000
to 2000 feet. █████████ says he saw this object at a 45° angle, however, he also
states it flew directly over his head). The object was going at approximately
30 to 35 miles per hour (in a direct northeast path. It only flew over for a minute,
but seemed to float without motion through the air. The disc was so brilliant,
the object looked like polished silvery, and █████████████████ the object for about
one minute, during which time it went approximately 500 feet; then, because of
the distance involved, it was lost to his sight. There was no sound nor odor,
no trail, and █████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
clear, bright, no clouds, and no ground haze. The object went in a straight
line to the northeast, and did not vary from this line ██████████████████████████
