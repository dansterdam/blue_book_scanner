Due to the poor state of the image, I am unable to accurately transcribe the entire content. The text is mostly illegible in this resolution. For a precise transcription, a clearer image or the original document would be necessary.

Here is the text from the document:

```
I said we ought to try to see if the entire barrel would burn, and
I put my gun over my head, holding it by the stock, and then every-
thing iron on it began to burn normally with a small blue flame
about 1 cm or 1/2 cm blowing off in the direction of the wind and
it was driven up a little along the iron in the wind direction.

At this point my companion said we should go to the FS barracks
so nothings would happen to us. I do say that at that time there was
a strong northwest wind, and after 4 minutes it stopped, or we went
down a slope, and the wind passed us, turning upward to an adjacent slope.

We have not written anything about this entire matter so that no one
would think we were seeing ghosts or something similar.
I'm glad for one thing about this true 1000% experience, that is
will not be considered as a joke or sensationalism.

With greetings only for peace!

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION
     The following information has been received from the Fourth Army Intelligence Liaison Officer, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, dated 6 December 1948:

"Colonel [REDACTED] Inf., U.S. Army, New Mexico Military District reports as follows:
     "On 3 or 4 November 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, I observed a ball
of light, reddish tint in color, I put it in disappear, rolling vertically. The
ball burst 1000-2000 feet from the ground in a spray of golden color which
extinguished before reaching the ground. This occurred at 12-1500 yards north
of the road on which I was driving. The location was approximately two miles
east of Vaughn, New Mexico, on a highway to (B-2)

     "On 23 November 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, I was driving west
of Highway 60, about 10 miles west of Vaughn, New Mexico. I observed a ball
of light, descending vertically, which burst 1000-2000 feet from the ground.
The conditions and appearance were the same as occurred on 3 or 4 November." (B-2)

"Colonel [REDACTED] stated that he did not report these incidents as he thought
they might have been connected with some Air Force exercises. He further
states that he heard no sound or saw no streaks during either incident,
which is understandable as he was travelling in a closed automobile, weather
conditions were clear." (B-2)

The image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it appears to be a page with handwritten text. However, the quality of the image and the legibility of the handwriting makes it difficult to act as an OCR system and accurately transcribe the text. The handwriting is not clear enough to produce a reliable transcription. If you require a transcription from documents like these, it would be highly recommended to obtain a clearer image or refer to any typed transcripts that may be available from the original source.

The document appears to be quite challenging to transcribe due to handwriting that is difficult to decipher, frequent indiscernible words, and possible language mixing or nonstandard spelling.
