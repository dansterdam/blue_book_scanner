Name and address of observer: Dr. [Redacted] and Wife
[Redacted] Mission, Arizona
Occupation and hobbies: [Redacted]

Comments of Interrorgator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

WHAT IS THE JUICE? 

At [Redacted] Mission Dr. [Redacted] was inter-
viewed on 16 February 1949. He said that at about 1940 on
14 February 1949, as he and his wife, [Redacted], were returning to Gallup,
they crossed the long bridge about two miles this east of Ganado. As
as they came up the hill west of the bridge, where the road heads
south, a brilliant white light was observed in the sky directly in front
of the car, and somewhat above the horizon. This object appeared to hang
stationary, then fall in a long curve to the desert floor. Both agreed
that the object has a slightly greenish color. Both agreed that the object
was an orange red as it fell, and that sparks appeared to trail off
the object, both while stationary and as it fell. Dr. [Redacted] said
this is his first mention was that it was and airplane and Army target, that
he had so reported to the Arizona State Police.
