UNITED STATES AIR FORCE

1 January 1949

SUBJECT: Sighting of unfamiliar object over Andrews Air 
Base by Cpl. ██████, 113th Control Squadron,
District of Columbia Air National Guard.

TO Headquarters
   Air Material Command
   The Pentagon
   Washington, D. C.

1. On December 31, 1949 I was at Andrews Field 
observing Colonel ██████ make preparations to take off
in a jet plane. I happened to look directly overhead and
saw an object floating—it seemed—leisurely in and out among
the clouds. When it tilted toward the sun it appeared to be
a huge sheet of tinfoil. I kept my eye on it and suddenly
realized that it was travelling at a terrific rate of speed
in a southeasterly direction. I am certain that had the object
been grounded it would have been the size of the National
(Guard hangar).

2. I have hesitated to divulge this incident.
However, I can assure you that it is absolutely true; I have
never had hallucinations. I dismissed the incident from my
mind at first, thinking that it was probably an object sent up by
meteorologists. The more I thought of its size and the 
height it was from the ground, however, the more significance
I attached to it.

Very █████████ yours,
█████

f. Object sighted:

(1) Number one (1)

(2) Shape: Rounded, with no fins or flat surfaces, about 20
to 30 feet wide and 80 to 100 feet long or cigar-shaped.

(3) Size: about 6 the size of a B-29 and at a distance of that
time.

(4) Color: silver

(5) Speed: two (2) times the speed of a B-29 aircraft, estimated
(estimated speed 500 mph)

(6) Heading: hovered for 5 - 10 minutes then turned into
north-northeast.

(7) Maneuverability: appeared to circle slowly with a 2
mile radius, object seemed to be under full control
while hovering.

(8) Altitude: 4,000 - 15,000 feet. Object climbed in area (sic)
circle 15,000 feet altitude.

(9) Sound: none heard

(10) Exhaust trail or mist: none

3. General Comments:

A. Summary of the investigation of witnesses [illegible]
tion that this object was first seen it appeared to be hovering in mid air
about 15 nautical miles north of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, &
stayed in this position for approximately 10 minutes. Then it took up a
approach of a formation of three J-29 aircraft & moved rapidly
toward the northeast and disappeared. In moving, at this time however,
it had an estimated speed of 500 miles per hour. It appeared to be
in a dive at an angle of approximately 10° to the horizontal. Sun-
light glistening off the object led the witnesses to believe it was
spinning.

B. Interrogation of the crews of the three J-29's which were
seen flying toward the object revealed not a single one of their
crew members having seen the object. Further, a check with the Davis-
Monthan Weather Office revealed that no weather balloons had been sent

alot on 31 December 1949 prior to the time the object was observed.

4. It can reasonably be concluded that some object was actually seen by the above witnesses. However, it is considered entirely possible that the object observed was a small kite, kite balloon, paper carried aloft by the wind, a wandering weather balloon, or other such object. Recent newspaper reports concerning "flying saucers" could have pre-conditioned the imagination of the witnesses resulting in their over estimating the speed and nature of the object.

1. On 30 November 1949, this office received a letter from the
Los Angeles Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation which reads
as follows:

On November 24, 1949, ████ ██████ motion picture actor, tele-
phonically advised this office that on the previous afternoon he had been
playing golf at the Lakeside Country Club with ████████. CABOT over-
heard █████ talking about a magnetic radio the latter had in his poss-
ession and which he claimed had come from a flying disc which had
crashed in New Mexico. █████, who claimed to be in the oil business,
had the radio with him at the golf course. █████ described the radio 
as being about 7x2x2 inches.

█████ further advised ████ that he and an unnamed scientist 
were using the radio as a "doodle-bug" to find oil deposits in the
ground. █████ stated that several of the flying discs had recently
crashed in New Mexico, Arizona, and Maine. He also told █████ that
the discs had contained men and that he had bits of cloth at home from
the clothing of these men. In addition, █████ claimed to have pieces
of metal from the gears of the discs.

███████ told ████ that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio is making a
"hush-hush" picture which could very well concern the matter of flying
discs inasmuch as the whole story would break soon any way.

█████ states that he has ascertained through a friend at Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer that they are now making a picture called "Project No.
█-██" (the actual number not known). █████ said he was unable to
Find out what this picture is about.

SUMMARY (ENTER CONCISE SUMMARY OF REPORT. GIVE SIGNIFICANCE IN FINAL ONE-
SEN LINE OR PARAGRAPH. LIST INCLUSUS AT LOWER LEFT. BEGIN TEXT OF
REPORT ON AN/ FORM 112-PART III.)
Technical Sergeant _______ observed an unidentified flying object at
120 hours, 30 December 1949 near Langley Air Force Base, Va.
The white, vertical, cone-shaped object appeared to be eight feet in diameter
at the base by twenty (20) feet in height. It was estimated to be at 5,000 feet
altitude 10,000 feet from the observer and moving slowly in a south-easterly direc-
tion. The base of the cone remained steady and the top slowly oscillated.

The report parallels press releases concerning unidentified flying objects re-
cently observed over the Carolinas and, in one case, identified in the Charleston
Observer newspaper by airport officials as being a mass of ice crystals formed in
the wake of an Air Force B-36 flying at 40,000 feet altitude.
