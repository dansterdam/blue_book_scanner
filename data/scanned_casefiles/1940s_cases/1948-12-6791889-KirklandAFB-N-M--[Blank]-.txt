To: Colonel Doyle Rees UNCLASSIFIED December 20, 1948

3.5 In the case of genuine meteors the paths are directed towards all points of the compass with equal frequency. On the contrary in the case of the green fireballs, plus by air audible symptoms seem to show that there is a very pronounced tendency for the paths to come in from the north half of the sky.

3.7 The three groups of anomalous greenish light phenomena show a curious association with well known, meteor showers, although none of these meteors known normally reach an intensity such as that seen in sights She has recently observed. For example, the observational ionized by Mr. Johnson appeared near the radius of the quadrantid shower of early January, Mr. LaPaz's observations of August tall near the radius of the Persid shower and the December observations also tall in a tentative curved by the Geminid shower. This relationship might indicate an attempt to render the green fireballs less conspicuous by causing them to appear only when there is coincidental meteoric activity.

3.8 As noted in an earlier communication, the spectroscopic visual green color reported for most of the December fireballs is peculiarly bright in the case of genuine meteors. By laboratory tests this peculiar color seems to be identical with that given off by copper salts in the blowpipe flame. If this identification is correct, the wavelength of the radiation from the green fireballs is near λ=5218Å .

3.9 The duration estimates of between 2 and 3 seconds reported for the green fireballs are considerably longer than those (0.4 — 0.5 seconds) for the ordinary visual meteors, but shorter than the duration (5 to 30 seconds or even longer).

3.10 For none of the green fireballs has a train of sparks or a dust cloud been reported. This contrasts sharply with the behaviour noted in cases of meteoric fireball—particularly those that penetrate to the very low levels when the green fireball of December 12 was observed.

4. On the basis of the various differences to which attention is called in section 3, the writer remains of the opinion that the fireball of December 12 was definitely non-meteoric and that a full possibility the same is true of most, if not all, the other bright green fireballs, which the OSI has had under investigation.

AT LAS VEGAS, NEW MEXICO                                      UNCLASSIFIED

1. On 8 December 1948, Lt. Tom GUTIEREZ, Chief of Police, Sixth
and University, Las Vegas, New Mexico, was interviewed reference reports
of unusual aerial phenomena. Chief GUTIEREZ stated that he had received
no reports of this nature and added that he was the chief's aide and record-
keeper of such items in the vicinity of Las Vegas. It is to be remembered
that MONTIE LEE, State Police, on duty in Las Vegas, on contacted.

2. On 8 December 1948, Patrolman FLOYD LEE, New Mexico State
Police, San Miguel County Court House (Phone), Las Vegas, New Mexico, was
interviewed reference reports of unusual aerial phenomena. LEE stated
he had received no reports of this nature and added that only on one
occasion last he overheard a conversation about seeing saucers in the neighbor-
hood of Las Vegas. This conversation occurred during a lull in otherwise
bad radio reception and it is questionable as to how much merit should be
subject to the UFO's stated if he received reports of this type he would report
same to the proper Federal Agency. LEE said that possibly a man answers
process he means flying a plane locally and doing advertising in a loud
manner with sound to the plane sound and (some light on the) Aerotec Airways
to have been seen in the vicinity of Las Vegas.

3. On 8 December 1948, Joe JOSEPHSALT, office manager, Las
Vegas Flying Service, Tacon Airport, East County Road, Las Vegas, is con-
tacted, was interviewed reference reports of Las Vegas this air incident in
the vicinity of Las Vegas. Las Vegas FLYING stated that she was the wife of
JOSEPH SALT, manager of the Las Vegas Airways. She MONTIE also stated
that business was unusually slow at the Western Airways, due to the airline
establishment of training of student pilots under the G.I. Bill. To Flying
Air Line and in which case this phase to be acceptable announcements this
that information could be obtained from the local newspaper office and ticket
sales should have more reports of pilots in the Las Vegas area.

No contact was not made with the local newspaper due to a desire of
keeping publicity about this investigation to a minimum.

4. On 8 December 1948, Mr. E. D. MILLER, Chief Aircraft Compliancy-
tor, Department of Commerce, Civil Aeronautics Administration (hereinafter
referred to as CAA), Box 1029, Municipal Airport, Las Vegas, is con-
tacted, was interviewed separately several reports of unusual aerial
phenomena. Mr. MILLER asserted he had heard of no incidents prior to this
interview and added that he was very much interested in events of this
nature. Mr. MILLER stated he had received no information about any aircraft
on 5 December 1948. A check of the CAA records for this date verified
his statements. Mr. MILLER stated that beginning immediately he would allow
the nearest Communication to report promptly incidents of this nature to
his attention. Air traffic 473, Page 1 provided to the Office of Special
Investigations, Kirkland AFB, will be "on alert" for the CAA to the proper
chaper to necessitate immediate investigative action, a report will be made
to a Federal agent residing in Las Vegas. Mr. MILLER requested that none of

2. W/S R. Q. Walton, # 6297936, Randolph Air Force Base, interviewed 2 January 49 stated that he did not see a flare or light on the night of 5 December 1948.

3. Major Roger R. Carter, A0-1o7677, A-3, Air Training Command, Randolph Air Force Base, interviewed 3 January 49 by Special Agents Hiram F. Johnson, Reuben Strickland and the writer stated in substance: That on 5 December 1948, at approximately 2200 hours, C.S.T., while flying a C-47 aircraft at 10,000 feet on a magnetic heading of 270°, indicating 189 m.p.h. about twenty-five miles North East of Albuquerque he observed an intense green light. This light was approximately 5000 feet above the plane and 5° to 10° to the right to the right. It appeared to be slightly east of Sandia Peak, 356°, north, 106° 27' west. Carter stated that he was looking at the peak lit up with a violet light noticed the light. The impression gained was that of an intense flash like a light being turned on. The light seemed to grow in intensity and then die out. The color was more green than blue. Estimated length of observation was from one to two seconds. No movement pertaining to the light was noted. The weather at the time was described as being a clear, cold end dark night.

Carter further stated that he was listening to the radio beam at the time and did not notice any radio interference.

4. Captain A. Goode, AO 551583, A-3, Flying Division, Air Training Command, Randolph Air Force Base was interviewed by Special Agents Hiram F. Johnson, Reuben Strickland and the writer on 30 December 48. Goode stated in substance that at approximately 2155 hours on December 5, 1948 while flying a heading of 230° magnetic, 115 miles North East of Alburquerque, he observed an intense greenish light forward to 2 miles off the right wing of the airplane. The estimated location of the light would be 350° 09' north, 106° 27 west.

At the time of the observation Goode was flying co-pilot in the right seat of a C-47 aircraft, altitude 10, 500 feet. The light appeared to be 500 to a 1000 feet higher than the aircraft. Visibility was estimated at 30 to 40 miles, no overcast, no moon. Speed of the aircraft was 155-160 indicated.

Goode stated that the length of the observation was from 5-15 seconds and he gained the impression of a round green light, accompanied by sparks and a fading tail. The object seemed to describe a parabolic curve rising behind the earth.

UNCLASSIFIED

Captain Coade is a veteran of combat flying in the ETO and
when pressed for a comparison to the intensity of the light ascribed
it as being more intense than the flare normally used in night photo-
graphy or bombing. Coade stated that he had never seen anything similar
to the phenomena noted and could offer no comparison.

5. On 3 January 1949 the files or the G-2 Section, Fourth Army,
were checked. It was revealed that Madeline G. Merchants is the subject
of an extensive file. The essence of the file is that Merchants has
been active over a period of two years compiling facts on all reported
aerial phenomena and writing letters to various Army area commanders
regarding same. Further Merchants is known to correspond with Communist 
front organizations and is considered dangerous.

6. Captain James G. Biddle, Executive Officer, Fourth Army GIC
Detachment, Fort Sam Houston, Texas informed 3 January 1949 stated
in substance that the Fourth Army is in receipt of a letter from the
Director of Intelligence, Headquarters General Staff, Washington, D.C.
advising them to expect reports of aerial phenomena during this period
of the year and to report same to AIO, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

DETAILS:

AT KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE UNCLASSIFIED

On 18 January 1949 Dr. LINCOLN LA PAZ provided a letter from one
******* **********, a student at the University of *** *****, relevant to
an observation of 5 December 1948. The information contained in this letter
is summarized below:

At about 2000 hours, 5 December 1948, while walking along the west
side of Varsity Village, a University housing area, ****** saw a bright
green "meteorite". The color was a brilliant green, as in a traffic signal
or a neon tube. There was a definite area to the object; i.e., it was not
merely a point of light. The size was very hard to determine, but was esti-
mated at one third that of Venus when that planet is visible in the sky.
****** did notice any claim of accuracy as to the size, however, stating
that he could not definitely say. The object appeared in the western sky,
vertically to about five degrees. There was a definite corona or halo effect,
but no sparks or trail were produced. The sky was hazy and there was some
cloud cover at the time of the sighting, but ****** did not recall the
extent of the cloudiness. No stars were visible in the part of the sky where
the "meteor" was observed.

No other report or observation for 5 December gives a time element of
2000 hours. ********* will be contacted by Dr. LA PAZ in an effort to obtain
precise measurement of his observation angle.

2. A report of observation by Inspector EARL WILLIS, AESS, was provided
by Lt. Col. JOHN A. CARROLL, Chief Inspector, AESS, Los Alamos, New Mexico on
17 January 1949. This report provided the following data:

Date: 6 January 1949 Color: Brilliant green
Time: .0310 Elevation: 3 to 5 degrees
Direction: Azimuth 30 degrees Trajectory: Flat
Speed: Slower than a meteor OP: Station 101

The object was visible for about two seconds, low in the sky to the
northwest. It moved in a straight line at a high speed. It looked like a
bright green meteor with trails. Its elevation of course did not vary. Direction
of movement was east to west, low on a level course, disappearing behind the
mountainous horizon to the west. (Inclosure 1)

3. On 7 January 1949 the Chief, Physical Security Branch, Sandia Base,
New Mexico, (CHRIST J. DOYLE), Forwarded a report of observation by PFC.
******** ********, ASN # 55 952 954, 8450th H.P. Group. ******** reported
that on 6 January 1949, while guarding an aircraft near the Ordnance Area,
Kirtland Air Force Base, he had observed a bright object traveling across
the sky. The time was approximately 1720, and the sky was clear, providing
a light blue background. The object was diamond shaped, about two feet long,
bright white in color, and moving at a high rate of speed. Altitude was
estiimated at 1500 to 2000 feet, and distance travelled was estimated at 500
feet. There was no noise or trail. Two other persons with ******** did not
see the object. (Enclosure 2)

4. Dr LA EAV transmitted a report to the District Commander, 17th District Office of Special Investigations, on 5 January 1949 relative to certain unexplained sound phenomena observed at Los Alamos. Pertinent summary of this report follows:

Anomalous sounds were heard at four different Security Stations at Los Alamos on the night of 30 December 1948. Three of these stations were visited in company with the AFSJ Inspectors who had heard the sounds. At Station 340 Inspectors ----------, etc said there were ghosts involved.

It said that approximately 2010, 30 Decmb [sic] 48 they heard a sound as of a train laboring up hill, although no trains or anything that they went out to find that the track, but found the roadway empty. Filing of their movements indicates that the duration of this sound was some seven seconds. The at about 2020, the sound was heard again and they drove out to check with the same results. Timing of the onset of movements they a potential of origin and obtaining readings they disclosed the occurrence made quite an impression on the inspectors and they discussed this matter from the standpoint of a "Hushh [sic] alarm was given over the communications net by headquarters. The Bogey was bearing at approximately in his plot which taken by two fine noise.
was filed to HQ at ORD in an aircraft repeatedly four times, it was definitely an airplane noise. Both men said that an airplane into one close to being the same type of sound, but not the sound was definitely that the sound was wholly similar to that of an airplane. Timing of movements showed a probable duration of 10 to 15 seconds for the brief sounds. Azimuth and elevation readings were taken for each estimated position of the sound.

At Station 350, ----------- and ----------- was interviewed relative to the sounds reported by him. They said that to and noted how the sounds reported at 2010, 2020, or 2050, but that about ten or fifteen minutes after the "Bogey" warning, he and the reported they had heard a sound like heavy wagons on this roadway and heard a sound like the whistle also made by some airplanes at Los Alamos, this likewise estimate to within directions to azimuth and elevation readings were taken of the estimated position of the sound.

Inspectors -------------- and ----------- were interrogated at Station 350. According to -----------, at approximately 2010 on 30 December he heard a noise which he believed to be the motor of a 110 horsepower Cub airplane. The sound lasted about 6 minutes. At about 2020 he heard the same noise again, this time for about two or three minutes. At about 2050 the same noise was heard. The "Bogey" alarm was then sounded by headquarters, and noise. The otherwise its reports of the sounds were responsible for the -------------- the plane noises, as the origin of the sounds was timing -------------- and azimuth and elevation readings were taken of the positions as indicated by -----------.

Inspector ----------- who had been at Station 350 at 2010 was interviewed by ----------- and said that the noise sounded like a high flying aircraft exhibiting display overflights, service to the northeast and ranging as far as 25 to 30 miles.

3. In this summary of the above interview, Dr. La Paz finds that the 
sounds were unlike normal aircraft sounds, that a B-29 could not have produced 
it, that the two associated round white had luminosities, which might indicate road-
lights, altho no road machinery of trucks had been operating, and two other 
investigators had heard similar sounds on the morning of 31 December at about 
0540.

Calculations based on the transit readings indicate that the sound 
originated on a point with coordinates 106 degrees 17 minutes, 35 degrees 52 
minutes.

5. AACS at Kirtland Air Force base was checked by the writer and so far
as their records show no aircraft were near Los Alamos during the times of 
the sound observations.

AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUND:

6. AACS at Walker Air Force Base was checked by Special Agent SHERIDAN 
W. CAVITT, and reported that no aircraft were shown near Los Alamos by their 
log during the critical times.

2. Pfc. Everitts advised that on 5 January 1949 he was guarding
C-97 airplanes at the landing strip, located adjacent to the
Ordinance Area, when at approximately 1730 hours he noticed a bright
orange travelling across the sky, from the Northeast towards the
Northwest. He related that the object was diamond shaped, approxi-
mately two feet long, and appeared to be much brighter in its center
than at both edges. In its train, that the object was approximately
1500 to 2000 feet in the air and travelling approximately 500 ft.,
horizontal to the earth’s surface, and was not a blink of time. 
Everitts was unable to estimate the speed of the object but stated
that he has seen low flying jets planes, and that this object travelled
much faster than the jets that he has observed. There was no smoke
or other vaporous material visible to Pfc. Everitts around or follow-
ing the object.

3. At this time Pfc. Everitts witnessed the object, he stated
that the sky was clear, furnishing a light blue background, and that
the object appeared to be a bright white light, with no other appear-
ent visible source.

4. Standing guard with Pfc. Everitt were Sgt. Richard Holeslogle
and Cpl. Wilson, and according to Pfc. Everitts, neither of which
men saw the object. Everitts explained that he called to Sgt. Holes-
logle, who was standing at the other end of the plane, and told him

LAS VEGAS, NEW MEXICO

This is a joint investigation conducted by Special Agents JOHN 
J. SMITH, Jr., and LEWIS E. JONES.

At 1715 on 3 December 1948, an AMC MAN, 40th
Air Force Base, and LEWIS E. JONES, both 
linked pilots, took off from Kirkland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico,
in a F-80 type aircraft. As LAM from flying an an [inverted altitude of
25,000 feet, 3000 feet level, approximately 2500 feet above terrain at a
speed of 550 miles per hour, the former reported seeing directly the 
plane a formation resembling a V with very brilliant intensity. As 
many phenomenon was observed. The object, position of the aircraft at the
time (20) miles west of the Las Vegas, New Mexico, radio range station.
At the time of the observation the aircraft was flying a compass course of
340°, the indicated airspeed was one hundred ninety (190) miles per hour and
the ground speed was approximately one hundred ninety miles per hour.

       Hying Flying as Co-pilot heard the pilot's side the side the directive
was received. The phenomenon was observed on the right side of the cockpit,
approximately 30° up angle from level. A dot was formed at latitude of 2,000
feet higher than the airplane of 15,000 feet above sea level. the aircraft's
position was observed covering a speed approximately 250 mph relative speed.
no abrupt turns nor up and down towards to the, angle of ascent of
the object was similar to the trajectory of course from flare of common
in the Air Force. However, the light was much more intense and has subject
appeared to be considerably larger than a normal flare. No smoke was observed
ride on the distance nor the size of the object was to other objects not vis-
able upon which to base a comparison. The object immediately larger and 
more brilliant than a shooting star, meteor or flare. In trajectory of the
object was almost short fast as down and was lost to the eye after climb-
ing towards Earth approximately two (2) seconds after the original sight. the
object in down state. its trajectory then dropped abruptly and a trail of
blazing fragments reddish orange in color was received falling toward the
ground. The fragments were visible for less than a second before disappear-
ing. The phenomenon was of such intensity as to be visible from the very
moment it ignited and was observed a split second later. It was not possible
to the comparison to known flares for longer than a split second before
disappearance.

The weather at flight altitudes was as follows; ceiling unlimited, visib-
ility a minimum of seventy-five (75) miles, no wind, 30 miles per hour 
below 30 thousand, the moon in the first half, stars approximately half way to its
zenith and south, or to the right of course. The 1855 weather observation
at Las Vegas, New Mexico, was clear, 30 miles visibility, temperature 30°,
down point 17°, the wind from the NW at 6 miles per hour, the altitude
was 20-24 inches of mercury. At 2012 the temperature the station remained
the same vicinity was approximately one and one-half hours just as another
phenomenon was observed.

On 3 December 1948, was at 1545 and accompanied by a crew chief 
took off from Kirkland Air Force Base at 1545 and flew to the area where the 
phenomenon had been observed the previous evening. A careful search of the
area, at no where phenomenon occurred in the investigation there.

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of
observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUM:  At about 2000 hours, 5 Dec 1948 while walking
along the west side of Varsity Village, ******* saw a bright green
"meteorite". The color was a brilliant green as in a traffic signal
or neon tube.  The size of visible area was very bright; i.e., it was
not merely a point of light, but the size to the object is doubtful.  It was
was estimated at 1/3 **** of Venus when that planet is visible in the
daytime. However, ******* discounted any claim of accuracy to size.
The object appeared in the western sky vertically to about 5°. There was
a definite corona or halo effect but no sparks or trail were produced.
The sky was hazy and there was some cloud cover at the time of the sighting
******* did not recall the extent of the cloudiness. No stars were
visible in the part of the sky where the "meteor" was observed.

NOTE:  No other report of observation for 5 Dec gives a time element of
2000 hours. ******* will be contacted by Dr LA PAZ in an effort
to obtain precise measurement of his observational angles.

Incident 223

At 2130 hours 5 Dec 1948, Capt -------- flying a C-47 AF #9921 enroute
from Lowry AF Base, Denver, Colorado, to Williams AF Base, Chandler,
Arizona, reported his position to the Control Tower, Kirtland AF Base,
as being approximately 10 miles east of Albuquerque. Capt -------- stated
he had seen a green flare arise from the ground to an altitude of approx-
imately 500 ft on the east slope of the Sandia Mountains at about 2127
hours. He was flying at 18,000 ft. Stated he had just seen the same
type flares at approximately 2105 hours just west of Las Vegas, New Mexico.

Other sightings of this or similar flare are as follows:

Separate Stations. Among the numerous observations so far made, there is
only one pair of corresponding observations, i.e., those made simultaneously
by different groups of observers at widely separated stations. The only
such observations are those mentioned by this writer on the reverse -
that of 79 Army engineers near Sandia Peak (Central, New Mexico - see report
on incident of 1948, December 12, 9h 2m plus or minus 30s), and a second
pair of observers station within the Los Alamos reservation. By graphic
reduction of the simultaneously made observations, the following facts have
been determined: The green fireball of December 12, 9h 2m plus or minus
30" appeared very near a point with the geodetic latitude 35° 50', longi-
tude 106° 39' and disappeared near a point with the coordinates latitude

It should be observed that the above figures are computed under the assumption that the periods of appearance and disappearance of the fireball were seen simultaneously by both the Zuni and Los Alamos groups. In case this assumption is not fulfilled, the real path could very easily be no more than 10 to 12 miles long, the velocity with respect to the earth no more than 10 to 12 miles a second, and the altitude of the sighting conditions out of between 3 and 6 miles lack of modifying information from a third station, the conclusions in the five (5) and etc) sheets range from an angular elevation a little less unlikely than the linear alts of the fireball was much less than 3 to 5 miles and more than 110 miles. It is interesting to observe the time lengthwise extension of the 25-mile path first given passes centrally over the Los Alamos reservation.

3. Significant Differences Between the Fireballs Observed in The Texas Arrwa December 2121 and Typical Meteors.

3.1 The horizontal motion of the path of most of the December fireballs is most unusual. Genuine meteors are rarely observed to move in horizontal paths.

3.2 Again the very low height of the December fireballs mentioned in section 2 above the velocity in sharp contrast from the minimum velocity for which height as is of the order or 40 or 50 miles are generally observed.

3.3 The velocity determined for the fireball of December 12 is considerably less than the yield of it is determined from typical meteors (and yet is considerably greater than the speeds of the V-2 rockets or jet planes or conventional flares).

3.4 In the case of meteorites that penetrate to as low levels as that determined for the fireball of December 12, the observed luminous phenomena are always accompanied by very violent noises. No noises whatever have been observed in connection with the various December fireballs so far investigated.

3.5 Genuine meteors normally show remarkable variations in brightness, beginning as fine thin hair lines, which are scarcely visible in the dark, and end on descending to the most vast mass of hot metal. It is, however, one of the 3rd and 1st implication of the theory advanced [text cut off]

Incident: 227

Dr. ******** attention was direction to an area about 15° west of Cygni
when by indirect vision he became aware of a very bright green ball
(apparent angular diameter 5') to the right of the area in his center
field of view which was moving from east to west very low on the horizon.
Shouting "Look" to his companions (Maj ***************, Kirtland Fld., Lt Allan Clark, Intel Officer, N. Mex. Wing CAP, snd
Inspectors ********* and ********* of the area in (Los Alamos, N. M.),
who then timed duration of fireball which ranged from 2.1 seconds to 2.3 sec.
The path of the green ball was almost exactly horizontal (altitude estimated
as only 3 or 4 degrees) until just a tenth of a second or so before it
disappeared. During the last one or two tenths of a second of its visi-
bility a slight but definite curvature downward developed in its path.
From the very beginning the ball was very bright, ********* comparison
with Sirius (at a much greater altitude than the green fireball) indicates
that during all but the last one or two tenths of a second of the fireball's
visibility it was at least of apparent magnitude -4 (minus four). Just as
curvature in its path developed, the magnitude of the fireball rose
slightly and it broke up into three or four smaller but still bright green
fragments which disappeared almost instantly. Although Lt ******** stopped
the car the moment the fireball disappeared and the occupants then stood
outside the car and listened for meteoritic detonations or rumblings,
nothing was heard. Two night guards at Los Alamos had also witnessed
the phenomena simultaneously. The green fireball of December 12th,
9 h 27 plus or minus 30s Zulu occurred very near a point with the coordinates
latitude 35° 50' longitude 106° 10' and disappeared near a point with
the coordinates latitude 35° 45', longitude 107° 5', traversing a nearly
exactly horizontal path with a length of very nearly twenty-five (25)
miles at an altitude above the surface of the earth of approximately 3
to 10 miles, depending on the estimate of angular altitude employed in the
reduction. The velocity with respect to the earth works out at between
8 to 12 miles a second - depending on the duration estimate used.
It should be observed that the above results are obtained under the
assumption that the points of appearance and disappearance of the fireball
were seen simultaneously by both the ****** and Los Alamos groups. In
case this assumption is not fulfilled, the real path could very easily be
no more than 10 to 12 miles long, the velocity with respect to the earth
then working out at between 3 and 6 miles a second. While there is thus
considerable uncertainty because of the lack of confirining azimuth observa-
tions from a third station, the concordance in the flying (5) different
estimates of angular elevation make it most unlikely that the linear
height of the fireball was much less than 8 miles and much more than 10
miles. It is interesting to observe that the backward extension of the
***inia path f;::-;: given passes almost centrally across the Los Alamos
reservation.

During the entire night of the 12th, meteors of all magnitudes from the
first to the fifth and of various colors (with white and yellow pre-
dominating and with no evidence of green) were occasionally seen emanating
from the Geminid radiant, ***** radiant was well above the horizon from

luminous arcs of great circles diverging from the radiant point and passing
downward to intersect the horizon under angles always large and for the
most part approaching 90° in value. In several cases the radiant point of the
bright green fireball seen from near Starvation Peak was very nearly, if
not exactly, parallel to the horizon. This green fireball certainly did not 
emanate from the Geminid radiant. 

Subject to discovery that a new (non-Geminid) meteoric radiant emitting 
numerous very bright fireballs of a vivid green color (deeper and richer
than the green or the beacon at the Municipal Airport south of Santa 
Fe, New Mexico) has suddenly become active during the first half of December, 
I am now convinced the various "green Fire" incidents reported to the O.S. 
are not meteoric in nature. See Incidents: 225, 226, 223, 224, 230

Significant Differences Between the Fireballs Observed in the Interval 
December 11 and Typical Meteors: 

a. The horizontal nature of the paths of most of the December fireballs
is most unusual. Genuine meteors are rarely observed to move in horizontal 
paths.

b. The very low height of the December fireball discussed in Section 
2 above sets it off in sharp contrast from the genuine meteors for which 
heights of the order of 40 or more miles are normally observed. 

c. The velocity determined for the fireball of December 12 is much 
less than the velocities determined from typical meteors (and yet is con-
siderably greater than the speeds of the V-2 Rockets or jet planes or 
conventional flares).

d. In the case of meteorites that penetrate to as low levels as that
determined for the fireball of December 12, the observed luminous phenomena
are always accompanied by very violent noises. No noises whatever have been 
observed in connection with the various December fireballs so far investigated. 

e. Genuine meteors normally show remarkable variation in brightness
beginning as fine thin hair lines, which are scarcely visible to the observers 
and then brightening up to flash out near the end of their paths. In the 
case of the December fireballs, most of the observers have reported that 
sine green balls appeared almost instantly at their full brightness.

f. In the case of genuine meteors the paths are directed toward all 
points of the compass with equal frequency. On the contrary in the case 
of the green fireballs, plots of admissible approach sections show that there 
is a very pronounced tendency for the paths to come in from the north half 
of the sky.

g. The large groups of anomalous green luminous phenomena show 
a curious association with well known meteor showers, although none

Incident: 227
such as meteor showers normally produce extremely bright green fireballs
of this type so recently observed. For example, the observation mentioned by
Mr Manley (Incident 231) occurred near the maximum of the Quadrantid shower
of early January. Similarly, the observation of August was near the time
of the Perseid shower (Incident 230) and the December observations (223, 223a
224, 226, 227, all fell in the interval covered by the Gemini shower.
This relationship might indicate an attempt to render the green fireballs less
conspicuous by causing them to appear only when there is considerable meteoric
activity.

h. As noted in an earlier communication the remarkably vivid green
color reported for most of the December fireballs is rarely observed in the
case of genuine meteors. By laboratory test, this peculiar color seems to be
identical with that given off by copper salts in the bivouac flame. If this
identification is correct, the wavelength of the radiation from the green
fireballs is near λ = 5218 A.

i. The duration estimates of between 2 and 3 seconds reported for the
green fireballs are considerably longer than those (0.1 to 0.5 seconds) for
the ordinary visual meteors, but shorter than the duration estimates invari-
ably reported in the case of a genuine meteorite fall (5 to 30 seconds or
longer).

j. None of the green fireballs seem to have a train of sparks or a
dust cloud following. This contrasts sharply with the behavior noted in
case of meteorite fireballs - particularly those that penetrate to the very
low levels where the green fireball of December 12 was observed.

NOTE: Inquiry at Holloman AF Base, Almazgordo, N.M., revealed that
research work at night and on Sundays does not involve the use of
any lighting device or flares such as described in the various
reports submitted.

FROM: Inspector
SUBJECT: Observations

1. This report is being made in writing at the request of

It will be divided into three parts: 1. Observations,
2. Recommendations, 3. A map indicating the point of my observations.
The third part of this report will not be submitted now, but will be
given later when a map is available to make this map accurate.

Inspectors ______ and myself, being on patrol for
the Reconnaissance Section A3335, arrived at Point Eagla 2050, December
20, 1948. We had driven up the road as far as it extended and was safe
under the circumstances and were sitting in the jeep with it headed
in the general direction of the road at this point. The direction in
which we were headed as well as all directions in this report will be
referred to with some degree of accuracy from the map which will be
submitted later to make this report complete.

As I was sitting in the jeep I observed a falling light in
the sky at approximately 2054. At first it appeared to be a white light
moving at about 45 degree cutch. As it continued to descent at [sic] angle
of sink rate was decreasing to the earth, it seem sinking to be an angle
until it went out of my vision at about a twenty degree angle behind
Point Eagla. I called the attention of Inspector ______ to this falling
light and he too observed it and has also been requested to make a report
on his observations. I continued to observe this phenomenon.
According to my first observations it appeared to be a white light,
clear and unbroken, falling very visibly through the night. However,
as I observed this light more closely it changed in appearance. It seemed
now to be broken instead of a clear stream. Its color was goldy [sic] and also
its nose seemed to have a red color, its back portion there changed.
Its stream of light left seemed [sic] however to be white. Its form seemed
to grow more concrete and seemed to be something besides just a white,
unbroken moving light. It seemed to have a Flat base, leaving a broken
red trail on each side. There it had appeared at a great height it was
now near the earth. Where its angle of glide had been 15 degrees, it
now appeared to have an angle of twenty degrees glide, and reminded me
very much of an airplane in flight. It seemed to fly through the air
object normally and not to fall straight to the earth as an uncontrolled
object controlled would. It was moving very very swiftly. It finally
disappeared behind Point Eagla.

The Headquarters was notified of our observations
and the angle movements. Upon this report I called ______ of the
laleer [sic] to 1-22 Headquarters and returned to Station 20 to make the
call, Found there ______ of the Armed Forces Physical Security
who had also observed the same things we did from a different point.
He observed there also. We made a report to them as well as
to you. We returned to Headquarters to find a suitable map to make
this report.

our observations more accurate from a descriptive point and to make a
written report of our observations.

   These are my recommendations. It is my understanding and
has been my observation that this light is of concern to the
Security Service. Attempts have been made to observe it more closely.
As a meas of observing this more closely, of finding out what it is,
and what happens to it, I would suggest that attempts be made to
observe it from the air and from the land. To observe it from the
would suggest these means. These suggestions are made with the
impressions that this thing has been observed before about the same times
and probably can be observed again. First the Air Forces of this
Department of Defense have excellent Photographic Planes. These are
fast and make good photographs. These could operate safely at night.
This thing if of any importance to the defense of our country would
necessitate no small means or daction but should entail all our
resources for its proper observation and understanding. Also
the Air Forces have small observing planes that might be used. The
Civil Air Patrol might be used. Certainly some attempts should be used
to observe and find out about this thing from the air. It appears in
the air. It disappears in the air. It might damage some of our Atomic
Installations eventually if it is not a natural thing and ran controlled.
Also attempts should be made by our own personnel to observe this thing.
Patrol 1/50 of the Booninance Service might be put on this Point Eagle
about the expected time of appearance each night. It might even be
important enough to place other patrols at points of observations
until this thing is understood and known about. Also in future attempts
to observe this thing radio silence should be observed under all conditions
by participating personnel until the thing is sighted. However, it
might be better if nothing is said over the radio in the future about it.
Radio conversation, if this thing is man controlled, may give a clue
to those controlling it that attempts are being made to observe it,
and may make difficult a discovery or an understanding of its nature.
The use of radar may also aid in its discovery.

OFFICE MEMORANDUM                                         UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

Date:  20 December 1948

TO:       Captain Shea

FROM:  Inspector [REDACTED]

SUBJECT: Object seen on I05 Patrol

From 2050 to 2100 this date Inspector [REDACTED] and myself were at Pt. Eagle in the regular performance of the I05 patrol.

At 2058 we saw the object described below making a path thru the sky. The direction of travel was from West to East, possibly a trifle Southerly. The object was travelling in an almost flat trajectory and its decline formed an angle with the horizon of approximately twenty degrees. The angle of elevation from our point of observation was approximately thirty degrees. The object was moving at a very fast rate of speed and disappeared behind the mountains directly to the northeast of Pt. Eagle. Total time of visibility was about one and one-half seconds.

Description:

An intense blue-white light about the size of a basketball. As the object traversed the sky, there was a faint trail of lights behind it, and two objects the size of a baseball separated from the main body. These objects were of the same color and intensity as the main body, and trailed behind it directly in its path at even intervals of distance equal to approximately three times the diameter of the main body. The size of the main body was approximately one quarter the size of the moon.

B. O. Wells, Director of Security December 30, 1948

TIME: 2053
DATE: December 20, 1948
DIRECTION: Approximately southwest to northeast
SPEED: Slower than a meteorite (approximately 1500 m.p.h.)
COLOR: White, with a pale greenish tail
ALTITUDE: Questionable
POINT OF OBSERVATION: Route 4 - north of Bandelier cut-off
OBSERVER:

STATEMENT OF OBSERVER:

At approximately 2053, December 20, 1948, while driving over State
Route #4 toward the South Gate (Station 390), I observed what 
appeared to be, at first glance, a meteorite traveling from left 
to right, i.e., at right angles to the direction I was moving. The 
object stopped almost the size of a tennis ball and was covered 
by a glaring white, similar to the color of whitehot steel in a 
steeling furnace. The ball had a small, conical shaped tail that 
appeared to be pale greenish in color, and this tail was not as 
clearly defined as the ball itself, seeming to be of a gaseous 
nature.

The object appeared to be travelling on a controlled, level course 
and was visible approximately a second and a half, disappearing 
from view behind the trees that bordered the road. It is made 
a sharp right turn on the road, the object was again visible for 
approximately a second, and this time it was considerably farther 
away. However, during this short second period I observed a small 
light to the right of the object, which appeared to be travelling 
with it. This smaller light was similar in appearance to a 
running light on an airplane, and it seemed to be reddish in color.
The object and accompanying light disappeared from view behind the 
tops of more trees, and I was unable to catch another glimpse of it.

Inasmuch as this event occurred at night, and due to the terrain I 
was travelling over, it is difficult to state the exact direction 
or mean the object was travelling. In addition, due to the source 
light intensity around me, as well as carrying no idea as to the size 
of the object itself, it is equally difficult to judge the altitude 
of the object.

Subject: Anomalous luminous phenomenon (Third Report)

In the second report of this series, a description was given of the path path
through the atmosphere of the green fireball of 1948, December 12, 17^8 MST
(plus or minus 30"). On the basis of considerable observations made from one
station near Sandia Peak, New Mexico, and a determination made at Los Alamos,
New Mexico, this fireball was found to have crossed over a point with the
coordinates: latitude 35° 30' N., longitude 106° 30' W., and to have disappeared
at a point with latitude coordinates: latitude 35° 30' N., longitude 106° 30' W.,
traversing an almost horizontal path at an elevation of about 10 miles above
sea level, with a length of about 25 miles, at a velocity of approximately
10 miles per second. (The minimum range becomes consistent with the observations
alluded to above that made subsequently indirectly by [Name redacted] which

3.6 In the case of genuine meteors, the paths are directed towards
all points of the compass with equal frequency. On the contrary in the
case of these green fireballs, a total of seven cases are on record in which
there is a very pronounced tendency for the paths to come in from the north
half of the sky.

3.7 The three groups of anomalous greenish luminous phenomena
show a curious association with well known meteor showers, although none
of these meteor showers normally produce extremely bright green fireballs,
such as those recently observed. For example, the observation mentioned
by Mr. KOHLMAYER on the morning of August 5, 1948 was at the time of the
Perseid shower and the December observations all fall in the interval covered
by the Geminid shower. This relationship might indicate an attempt to render
the green fireballs less conspicuous by causing them to appear only when
there is considerable meteoritic activity.

3.8 As noted in an earlier communication, the remarkably vivid 
green color reported for most of these new meteor falls is really abnormal 
in the sense of genuine meteors. Every laboratory test of peculiar colored 
flames, so to be identical with that fire ball copper salts in the blowpipe
flame. If this identification is correct, the wavelength of the radiation 
from the green fireballs is near 0.5252\.mu.

3.9 The duration estimates of between two and five seconds reported 
for the green fireballs are occasionally longer than those (i.e., 0.5 to 
3.0 seconds) for the ordinary visual meteors, but shorter than the duration 
estimates invariably reported in the case of a genuine meteorite fall 
(5 to 30 seconds or even longer).

3.10 For some of the green fireballs has a train of sparks or a 
dust cloud has been reported. This contrasts sharply with the behavior noted
in case of meteoritic fireball-particularly those that pertain to the
lower levels where the green fireball of December 12 was observed.

4. On the basis of the various differences to which attention is 
called in section 3, the writer remains of the opinion that the fireball
of December 12 was definitely non-meteoritic and that in all probability
the same is true of most, if not all, the other bright green fireballs, 
which the OSS has had under investigation.

It is found that the fireball doubly observed by Messrs.V and M, at ----, and ---- appeared at a height of at least 10 miles and descended at an angle of about 45º to the vertical (90º being to horizontal) and disappeared at a point C at an elevation of only 23½ miles above the horizontal plane through the point C from which it leveled off and dived (C to its point of disappearance, E), the fireball followed a nearly horizontal path approximately 7.5 miles long moving with a velocity of between 3.75 and 7.5 miles per second, depending on the duration estimate adopted. The coordinates of the projection of C on the earth are 35º 55' N, 106º 30' W, and those of the projection of E are 35º 51' N, 106º 23' W. The forward extension of this fireball's path on the earth, if dotscribed by the above parabolic passage would bring it to the vicinity of the town of Los Alamos.

It should be noted that the ascending branch of the path of the fireball was observed by Inspector ---- at ----, but was considerably curved, the maximum elevation of this portion of its path was estimated. It should also be noted th and no sound was heard, although the distance from the observers to the fireball and E from the fragment to the observers should have been only a few miles at most. I have no hesitation in believing that an object possessing the real path and the other peculiar characteristics of by --------, and ----
was not a falling meteorite.

Incident #243 -- Los Alamos, New Mexico -- 28 December 1948

The object described here seems to belong to the mysterious family of "New Mexico green flashes." See report on Incident #223 for detailed discussion.

It can be said, however, that it this is regarded as an isolated incident, the description is not very different from that of a fireball. It is the occurrence of these incidents in a seemingly definite pattern that argues very strongly against the meteoric hypothesis.

SUBJECT:  Unknown Object

At approximately 0431, this date, while looking east from Station 108
towards Station 101 I noticed high in the sky what appeared to be a falling
star, white in color, descending in a vertical path. My attention remained
with the object when I noticed the rate of descent seemed to be slower than
that of a falling star. After watching it lose altitude for several seconds,
I saw it suddenly disappear with a greenish-tinged flash which momentarily
illuminated a small cloud between the object and myself.

The object may also have been traveling east or west to some extent
since I could not estimate that angle; however the object descended in a
perfectly straight line with reference to North and South. At the time of the
flash the object was a good distance east of Station 101 and at an estimated
altitude of six thousand feet.

civilian, Plummer Night Jr., was interviewed by A N N R T T W, Field 
Investigator. He related that he and one Tyrone Timms, civilian, were on 
the easterly end of Sandia Field, Albuquerque, New Mexico. They heard an 
aircraft at 2315 hours, 5 December 1948, but saw no aircraft until 2320 hours. 
Nine M-25's, in a C-47 type airplane at an altitude of 9,000 feet, with a 
compass heading of 272 degrees, on a 5? descent, and traveling at a slightly 
faster speed than normal, saw a bright object which did not reflect any light 
from their aircraft, and in the midst of the Montanas has acted as a change 
course with a sharp approach and with a violent flash, at 400 feet from the 
planes when which was described as being disc-shaped, cream colored. This 
object at first appeared to be soundless but when within approximately, a 
thousand feet distance from the observers it emitted a shrill whistle type hum. 
The aircraft observers succeeded in turning their craft around, the object 
then suddenly soared and its maneuver outmaneuvered the experienced pilot, 
it then for only a few seconds zoomed to 10000 feet and could not be sighted or 
tracked by the observers. Both VAN LLOYD and SMITH were of the opinion 
than it would have been impossible for anyone in the passenger compartment 
to have observed this phenomenon. Mr. GEYER stated that as far as he 
could observe this object and added that to the best of his knowledge all 
of the passengers were asleep.

NOTE: It is to be noted that there is a discrepancy in the color of the 
UFO observed that was reported from the cited interview.

5. On 9 December 1948, Colonel WILLIAM E. BATES, Infstaffr, 
Civilian Components Affairs Officer, HQ Fourth Military District, was 
interviewed in his office, by Carl Harges, 4125th AAF Base Unit, 
Kirtland field, in New Mexico. This interview was conducted by 1st Lt
J.V. BAAL, Inf., AGf Corps, and the result was, Colonel Bates had 
seen the phenomenon himself a year and half before on July 1947. 
He states he had just relieved the previous sentry of Tinninin Inn, 
(over)
sandia base park itself. This occurred in the early hours of Thanksgiving 
evening. The phenomenon appeared to be approximately 7000 or 8000 feet 
feet above the ground when at first observed and descended slowly and 
finally hit a lower than suggested speed, the altitude, the object, then acted
totally like a typical and a man-made aircraft only it is silver, flat and more 
than mile long. Upon reaching a point exactly two hundred feet above 
the surface of the terrain, the object stopped to an episode although no 
marks were apparent Colonel BATES jumped onto his automobile and went to 
pursue the object, at the same time considering an identification, this 
was said to his taking place in the area when aircraft activity, was still 
not yet permitted, at this time the phenomenon assumed a fiery red, 
color and descended low and with little warning spark by bolic of extinguished 
before touching the ground, Colonel BATES stated that he was on this 
job 22 years the army and 10 years and never had witnessed anything 
that he admits was planted by a hoax. Colonel BATES did not express the 
cause or investigate further.

Colonel BATES advised that on or about 3:37 on 5 November 1948, 
at again on 23 November 1948, he observed similar phenomena as date
cited previously. These observations were in the same vicinity of the 
original phenomenon in January 1946, maps attach, in New Mexico. All three of these incidents occurred as approximately 2200 hours. Col. BATES

Subject: Report of Anomalous Sounds Observed by AECIS personnel at Los Alamos
on 1948, December 30

1. On 1948, January 5, Major C. L. Pailthorp, USAF, and the undersigned
under the guidance of Lt. Earl D. Hedgcock, AECIS, visited three of the four
stations at which anomalous sounds were heard during the night of 1948,
December 30. In this present preliminary report, a summary of the pertinent
facts is given and, on the basis of azimuth and elevation readings taken at
the three stations where sounds were heard simultaneously, an approximate
determination is made of the location of the sound sources in space.

2. At Station 1400 statements were obtained from AECIS Inspectors —————
and ———— According to ———— and ————, at approximately 2010 on
December 30 they both heard what they at first thought was a truck laboring up
the hill near X below their station. ———— then ———— to ———— that they nee-
sarily went to the door to make the customary inspection, only to find that the
roadway was empty. The sound terminated within a second or two after they open-
ed the door and stepped outside. Repetition of their notations and conversation
timed with a stop-watch showed that the sound occurred approximately 7 seconds.
About 10 minutes later, at approximately 2020, the same incident occurred
again, only then it sang from the other way, seeming to move toward
outside both men racing each other from chairs by a stove, a stop-watch
determination for this case gave a duration for the sound of 3.5 seconds.
This second repetition of the unusual sound made a considerable impression
on the inspectors involved and the matter was under discussion during the
half hour that elapsed before a bogey alarm came in over commutations at
approximately 2050. By this time, ———— had left Station 1400 and the third
observation was made by ———— and ————. According to the inspectors,
the noise heard at approximately 2010 was definitely an aerial noise in
contrast to the noises heard after 2010 and 2020. It is their firm opinion
on the basis not altogether articulate stirrings ———— ———— although both
agreed that the sound of a plane motor probably came closest to representing
what they heard. A stopwatch determination indicated a duration on 10-15
seconds for the aerial noise. Because the inspectors felt that they made
mre accurate determinations of position for the second and third incidents
than for the first, azimuth and elevation ro?dings were taken only for the
occurrences at 2020 and 2050. According to ————, the azimuth of the sound
heard at 2020 was ———— and the elevation ————. According to ————,

these quantities were 750 340 90 and 430. According to the azimuth to the sound heard at 2050 was 990 430, and the elevation 430 30; according to 430, these quantities were 1010 450 and 450 30.

At Station 590 a statement was obtained from AEBB Inspector 430. also
430 (his companion on the night of December 50). Inspector 430 was not available for interrogation on January 5). According to Inspector 430, none of the sounds observed at Station 450 at 2010, 2050 and 2050 were heard at Station 390, but some 10 to 15 minutes after the boggy warning at 2050, both he and Patton heard what first sounded like the rumbling of heavy wagons on a roadway and what later sounded like a whistling noise made by some airplanes while in flight. The duration of the sound as determined by a stop-watch measurement of main actions in going outside, returning to the communications set, and again going outside, was 45 seconds. However, after reports that he listened to the sound probably for a minute or more after he went outdoors the second time; and according to 430, the azimuth of the sound heard at 2100-2105 was 400 30' and the elevation 450 15'.

At Station 330 statements were obtained from AECB Inspectors 430 and 430
430 on December 30, he heard a noise in the sky which he believed to be the motor noise of a 140 h.p. Cub. The duration of his 2100 hrs observation of this noise was estimated at about 5 minutes; about 2010 he made a second observation of the same noise, the duration this time being only about 2-3 minutes. (So faint was the impression that the observed noise originated in an airplane flying over the prohibited area that a complete blackout was in effect both during the first observation and the second in the hope that actual lights on the planes would be observable. However, no visual contact whatsoever was established with the source of the noise.) At 2050 a third observation of the same noise was made and no correction was possible that an airplane was responsible that on this occasion a boggy warning was transmitted to all stations. It is the understanding of both 430 and 430 that information transmitted by them to headquarters was responsible for issuance of the boggy warning. The duration of the third sound was estimated to have been approximately 2-3 minutes. Inspector 430 confirmed all of the statements made by Inspector 430 as to the qualification. That the first interpretation of the noise heard at 2010 was that it came from a light tank cruising on the high road coming into Station 350 from the north. The incongruity of confusing the noises of the heavier (225 h.p.) motor of a tank and the lighter (75-100 h.p.) motor of a
Camp type plane had been the subject of discussions between Inspectors 430 and 430, and they had resolved the issue by noting that even the light motor of a Cub would be laboring heavily in the high altitude carrying the bomb load. December 10 is believed to have taken place. According to Inspector 430, the azimuth of the sound heard at 2010 was 230 20'
and the elevation 230 15'; at 2050 a azimuth of the sound heard at 2050 was 330 30' and the elevation 220 50', and no azimuth or elevation was 2050 was 330 40' and the elevation 220 50'. Since Inspectors 430 and 330 performance in this type of strain, it is believed that 430 unusually keen 430 discrimination. Since it would not have been feasible to 430 bomb by 430, 430 would be deployed under 430 The sound 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 ALLOWED DATA GAP

5. In addition to the men personally interviewed at Stations 340, 350, and 
360, a telephone conversation was held with in response to , who 
had also heard the sonorous noises at Station 350. According to , the 
first heard the noise (identified as the airplane motor of a Cub) at approxi-
mately 2010, at which time the noise to him seemed to be almost directly over-
head at Station 350. The plane (noise) seemed to orbit this position for 
approximately 2 minutes, and then the plane (noise) slowly receded toward the 
northeast and continued to orbit at very low elevation in this direction for 
approximately another 33 minutes.

6. On the basis of all the interviews held, the following summarizing 
statements can be made;

6.1. Each man interrogated was asked if any other time during 
his experience he had heard such noises as were heard on the night of 
December 30. Without exception, all answers to this question were in the 
negative.

6.2. Although six of the seven observers interposed, in one way 
or another, associated the actual sounds with airplane noises, under 
questioning each man admitted that in certain respects the noises heard 
were unlike any plane noises he had ever heard. It was quite apparent that 
the men were attempting to describe very unusual sounds in terms of those 
familiar noises with which, as former Air Force flyers, they were best 
acquainted.

6.3. Since Weather Bureau reports indicate that the under surface of 
the overcast blanketing the Los Alamos area was at an elevation of appro-
ximately 13,000 feet, the identification of the noises observed with motor 
noises of a Cub type plane is obviously impossible. This improbability 
had already occurred to all of the men interviewed, all though they had 
estimated the under surface of the overcast to lie at a height of not more 
than 10,000 - 12,000 feet.

6.4. The existence of the overcast at once suggests the possibility 
that the noises observed were really surface noises originating in the 
operation of heavy machinery and reflected from the overlying cloud layer 
in such fashion as to similitude sounds of aerial origin. It is this and other 
evidence that this possibility has been exhaustively investigated and is 
definitely ruled out. No heavy machines and none of the tanks stationed 
in the Los Alamos area were in operation during the interval when the 
noises were heard.

6.5. Another possibility which occurred to nearly everyone who heard 
the noises was that instead of originating in a low-flying Cub type plane,
the sounds had their origin in heavier motor-ed planes flying across the 
overcast, and presumably lost. This hypothesis is regarded as inacceptable 
for several reasons. In the first place, all 3937314 in that vicinity 
to patrol than very plane of its own, there was virtually certain "Padding 
the Los Alamos area. In the second place, no radio distress signals or

other attempts by the crew of this hypothetical lost plane to make a
position known wer observed. And finally, two AACS Operators
(who had no financial o [?] responsibilities) observed slight variations
the night of December 30 reported loud thumps the same sort or anoma-
lous sounds as heard at Station 370 at 0540 on the early morning of
December 31. These sounds were heard for several minutes and were
reported to have receded slowly toward the southeast.

7. If we assume that Stations 540 and 350 observed the same sound
sources at 2010 and 2020, that these sources are found to project into
point lying near the road leading west out of Vaughn, into joint
Station 340. On the basis of the elevation determinations made at Station
350, it is furthermore found that the first source would be about 700 feet
lower in elevation than Station 340 and the second source approximately 1350
feet lower than this station. These differences in elevation would again
seem to suggest that the sound sources may have been situated on or near the
paved highway. However, the very careful observation made by our experienced
transit man, Inspector Aukutt, at Station 350, 2020 approximately 1350 feet
lower than Station 340 should surely make us entirely incompatible with
car than station 350. Actually, hes heard a DC3 airplane. In this
his sound source was at an elevation of not more than 11,000 feet above the
horizontal plane to which Station 350. It might therefore, vary seem approxi-
mately 10,000 feet above not below, Station 340. This incompatibility larg-
discrepancy shows that our intial assumption - the inaccepable and there-
fore seems impossible to establish a concordance between observation made
at Stations 340 and 350 PR so it to be a bogey warning, i.e. during the time
when the observers at Station 350 heard the sound only from inside their
observations in a control to hide observers and Station 350, to make their
observations in the open air. The observers at Station 340, on the other
Station 340 to audibly heard a sound emnating from a lighted aircraft
above them, in accordance with the condition imposed on them by observ-
observations, what they heard might well hayve been so distorted by the aetherial
tonalities surrounding them that their perception led to all sorts of noise.
to harshly traffic a rumens and by their mis observation to employ all naga-
tive observations were measured for them at Station 350 on January 5.

8. In sharp contrast to the discordane noted in the observations pre-
ceding the bogey warming at 2010, the open-air observations made at and
immediately following the warning show a quite satisfactory concordance.
In fact, if we assume that all three stations, 340, 350, and 390 were listen-
ing to the same sound source at 2050 and shortly thereafter, then the actual
location the even was several 100's of miles from the actual
observation observed at Station 340 would, 230 degrees, as computed from the angular
and at Station 390 is 10,136 feet. If we pair Station 340 and 350, the
projection of the sound source on the surface of the earth lies approximately
the coordinates 106° 17' 55° 32', while if we pair stations 390 and 350,
the coordinates of the projection of the sound source on the earth differ
from the above by less than one-half minute in longitude and by less than

and the delay between the time of observation and the time when transit 
measurements were made, it is felt that such a discrepancy in the projections
is not surprising.

9.  Unless some as yet undiscovered surface source of sound, which might 
have produced by reflection from the overcast such apparently aerial noises
as were observed at Stations 340, 350, and 390 is uncovered, the facts set
forth above would seem to prove that on December 30 between the hours of 2000
and 2100 some sound producing source was in motion in or possibly beyond the
overcast above the Los Alamos area. Whether this could have been a conven-
tional airplane or not must be decided by those who have access to experience
and information not at the command of the undersigned.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

UNCONVENTIAL AIRCRAFT
(NEAR KIRTLAND AFB-ALBUQUERQUE)

(Unconventional aircraft reported in a supplement to report titled "Experimental Activity, date 3 January 1949.)

1. Personnel of this office, in checking on incident of unidentified aircraft appearing southwest of zone B at 1248 hours on 7 DEC 48 noted that:

a. At 1236 CST, 7 Dec 48, a MWO, Kirtland Field, noted a strange flying object heading SE. This object seen for approximately 2 or 3 minutes by MWO and others in tower. No photograph made.

b. This object was odd in shape, (estimated 20' from tip to tip), no sound or exhaust fumes from it. Disappeared in a cloudless sky. Rate of climb and speed unknown.

c. Safety of this aircraft definitely determined as not being a Navy drone (report attached). Checking with CAA and AF bases as well as aeronautical schools revealed none knew of the object--that it was anomalous in aeronautical characteristics.

d. Another flying object flying 1700 hours, 7 Dec, sighted and chased by a pilot near same place. His description of object and actions parallel those of the MWO, above. See TWX that follows. No details available from very wild claims appearing in newspaper misapprehensions.

2. Gen. TAYLOR, conclusively, at this time directed, on account of need for security, that all engineers who have sighted this flying unknown to be given a re-direct their complaint into this office. It will be his decision as to use of this information after considering the possibility of the necessity to check the stability of their mental health and other pertinent data concerning the character of informant himself.

District No. 17
Office of Special Investigations

Institute of Meteoritics

Subject: Report of Anomalous Sounds Observed by AFSB personnel at Los Alamos
on 1948, December 30

1. On 1949, January 5, Major E. L. Phillips, USAF, and the undersigned
under the guidance of Lt. Earl R. Rigthower, AUSA, visited three of the four
stations at which anomalous sounds were heard during the night of 1948,
December 30. In the prints preliminary report, a similar one of Sergeant
Booth is given and, on the basis of azimuth and elevation readings between the
three stations where sounds were heard simultaneously, an approximate
determination is made of the location of the sound sources in space.

2. At Station 340 statements were obtained from AFSB Inspectors *******
and ****** according to ****** told ****** that is was approximately 2010 on
the night of 1948 when he told "Boy First Class" to take their airforce car
and went to the door to make the customary inspection, only to find that the
roadway was empty. The sound terminated within a second of two after they opened
the door and stepped outside. Repetition of their motions and seven seconds
timed with a stopwatch show that the sound endured approximately 7 seconds.
About 10 minutes later, at approximately 2020, this same incident occurred
again, both men raising from their chairs, opening the door, and stepping
outside only to discover that the roadway was again empty. A stop-watch
determination for this case gave a duration for the sound of 5.5 seconds.
The second repetition of the unusual sound gave a considerably longer duration
on the inspectors involved and the matter was under discussion during the
half hour that elapsed before a bogey alarm came in over communications at
approximately 2050. By this time, ****** and ****** station 340 and the third
observation was made by ****** and ******. According to these inspectors,
the noise lasted approximately 2010 - 2020 ****** a small milling in
this respect to ****** has at 2010 and 2020, neither man was willing to
identify the noise as characteristically engine airplane, while both
suggested that this sound or plane motor probably came closest to representing
what they heard. A stopwatch determination indicated a duration of 10-15
seconds for the aerial noise. Persons to Inspectors felt that they made
noise assuring determinations or scaling the sound and find clear to them

advised that as far as he knew no interviews were being held by the
FBI, OSI, Office of the Surgeon General, or any other office.

9. Colonel RATCH did not know any of these incidents, but when the
existing information of similar occurrences having been observed, did
to furnish the information contained in this report.

9 December 1948, Dr. LINCOLN La PAZ, Director, Institute
of Meteoritical Study, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, N. Mex., was
interviewed in his office by Special Agent JAMES M. SLAY, F.B.I. Dr. La PAZ
provided his estimate which indicated that object that landed Noviok on
23 was technical Director, Operations Analysts Section, Hq. 4th Air F.
Force, and is duly recognized as an official authority in the A.F. in
Meteoristics. Everyone referred to pattern on Geophysics and Astronomy,
he was available at the time. Conferenced with Officers, U. O. Cox on the
in in the capacity of same at secret's 1987-1947, on estimates by
the Air Material Command, Wright-Patterson AFB Force Basis, Oh.

8. The La Paz analyzed the behavior of the records and stated
that these aerodynamic bodies have not yet been explained. He is
considered as active. He advised, in view of the unexplained Aerodynamics
incident, that the conference on that subject, which is classified, be
to classify meteoritic salt in Arizona, that has not been localized, that
the present phenomenon could be investigated and an attempt be made to
identify them.

9. On 13 December 1948, Dr. La Paz gave a statement concerning
an incident, which he had recorded on 9/03 p.m. on 12 December 1948. Dr.
La Paz's statement is included as Tab D, Inc.

10. On 11 December 1948, Major WILLIAM P. GODSOE, 4th Army Liaison
Intelligence Officer, Sandia Base, Hq 4th Army, advised S/A A.C. Irving,
that there were no measures in this area, and no experiments involving
the use of rockets or flares.

11. On 12 December 1948, Col. HAROLD G. CUM, Base Coordinator,
Kirtland Air Force Base, Kirtland Field, New Mexico, was interviewed and
Col. W --kins, Jr., we --ontacted at the home of Col -stice's
supervisor, and feels that in the event that there were, he would be so
advisable.

12. On 7 December 1948, S/A HERMAN E. TUNNY, reported from
Williams Airforce Base, Chandler, A, Arizona, that A/F PT-80-17, number
AD-9921, was piloted by Ca[--]E. (--], 55983. The copilot was
interviewed by Mr. Major H. M. CARTER, AL--]7557, and the Flight Instructor
was Hq Sq. 3c C. HANSH, AC2--]175 (somewhere in this category). All of

these quantities were 390 40' and -90. According to Figeroa, the azimuth of
the sound heard at 2050 was 390 40' and the elevation 490 30'; according to
******, these quantities were 1010 45' and 1140 30'.

3. At Station 390 a statement was obtained from Army Inspector ******, also
heard the continuous sounds, but Inspector ****** was not available for inter-
rogation on January 5). According to Inspector ******  none of the sounds ob-
served at station 540 as 2010, 2020, and 2050 were heard at Station 390, but
some 10 to 15 minutes after the hoovering act at 2050, both he and ****** heard what first sounded like the straining noise of heavy engines on a roadway and
which later sounded like a whistle rising rapidly to great sharpness and very loud in
flight. The duration of the sounds as determined by stop-watch measurement
of aircraft acting in or in association, according to the continuous burst,
and irregular gusting, was 45-63 rpm. Furthermore, ****** reported that he
was lead to the sounds probably for a minute or more after he went outdoors
the second time. According the places, the azimuth of the sound heard at 2100-
2105 was 420 00' and the elevation 450 15'.

4. At Station 530 statements were obtained from four inspectors, all approxi-
mately 240 feet apart in a North-South line pointing directly at ******. 
no real or necessary tie to the incident was present, which he believed
by the noise heard at 140 ft. out. The duration of his first observation
of the motor noise if it really was a noise at this time-being only about 2-3 seconds
in length. (So definite was the impression the observed noises originated
in an airplane flying over the field that ***** to complete blackout was
executed both during the first observation, and the second in the hope that
the lights on the alleged would be observable. However, no visual contact
whatever was established with the source of the noise.) At approximately
2045 a third observation of the same noises was made and according to the
impression that an airplane was going into a nose dive as he was
warning was transmitted to all stations. It is by understanding or both
****** and ****** that the information stated to the inspector's was
responsible for issuance of the bogey warning. The duration of the third
sound was estimated to have been approximately 2-3 minutes. Inspector ****** confirmed all of the statements made by Inspector ****** with this qualification: that ****** first interpretation of the noises reported at 2010 was that it came from a jet tank cruising on the high road into Station 530
(225 s.f). The noise grew out or other ... Coming ... the above on
(225 s.f.), more of a bank and the flight (76 l.p.m.-144 l.p.m.) motor or
Club type planes had been the subject of discussion between Inspectors ****** 
****** until they had rejected the flying by intuition, since the
motor Club would be laboring heavily in the high altitude where the
noises on the night of December 20 to be believed to have taken place.
Inspector ****** the azimuth of the sound heard at 2010 was 390 20'
****** the duration of the noises heard on December 30 and January 5
except 390 2' and the elevation 250 30'. Inspector ****** used and
time on the tape of a transit, it being felt that was able to achieve
accurate azimuth determinations. Since it would not have been possible to
have set up the transit in the positions occupied by ****** ****** at the
time he observed the sounds on December 30, no azimuth-elevation reading

2. The Best Photo of the Only Green Fireball. So Far Observed at Two
Separate Stations. Among the numerous observations so far made, there is
only one pair of corresponding observations, i.e., those made simultaneously
by different groups of observers at widely separated stations. The only
such observations are those obtained on the night of December 12 by one
group of observers near Hanover Peak (Jornal), New Mexico - see separate
radiation of 1948, December 12, 9h 2m p.m. or mms 30s), and a second
pair of observers stationed within the Los Alamos reservation. By graphic
reconstruction of the trajectories of observations, the following estimates
both observers seem generally reliable: December 12, 21h 02m or mms
30s appeared very near a point with the coordinates latitude 35° 50', longi-
tude 106° 00' and disappeared near a point with the coordinates latitude

Its normal velocity as the above results are obtained under the assumption that the points of appearance and disappearance of the fireball were seen simultaneously by both the Barney and Los Alamos groups. In one series assumption this is so fulfilled, the real path could very quality be non more than 10 to 12 miles long, the velocity to with respect to the earth perhaps winding out to between 3 and 5 miles a second, while there is thus considerable uncertainty because of the lack on a verified time, data observations from a third station, one or distance in the ETTR (25 different azimuths of angular moltion means a possible local maximum 20 miles, a time of arrival at each that is to and much more than 11 seconds, or 21 miles/sec; leaving no observes the backward extension of the 25-mile path it first from passes almost centrally none the Los Alamos reservation.

3. Significant Differences Between the Fireballs Observed in the Interval December 2-21 and Typical Meteors.

3.1 The horizontal, and not extra of the north of the December Fireball is most unusual. Cumulove meteors are rarely observed to move in horizontal paths.

3.2 Again the very low height of the December Fireball as discussed in section 2 above sets it's off in sharp contrast of the resulting meteors, for which heights of the order of 40 or to 70 miles are normally observed.

3.3 The velocity determined for the Fireball of December 12 is much less than the wouldd be speeds of type meteors (and it is consequently greater than the speeds of the V-2 Rockets or Jet planes or of conventional Planes.

3.4 In the case of meteorites that penetrate to as low levels as that determined for the Fireball of December 12, the observed luminous phenomena are always accompanied by very violent noises. No noises whatever have been observed in connection with the various December Fireballs so far investigated.

3.5 Daytime meteors normally show remarkable variations in brightness, beginning as faint thin hair lines, which are scarcely visible to the observer, and then brightening up to flash out near the end of their paths, in the case of the December Fireballs most of the observers have reported that the green balls appeared almost instantly at their full brightness.
