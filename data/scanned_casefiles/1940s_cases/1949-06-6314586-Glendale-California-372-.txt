June 17, 1949

SUBJECT: ALLEGED FLYING DISC

TO: Commanding Officer 18th Dist. OSI (IG) USAF
Heywood, California

At 1130 17 June 1949 this officer received a telephone call from the
executive officer (Mr. Charles Moorehead) 11 Naval District Intelligence Office,
San Diego, California, regarding a flying disc.

Mr. Moorehead stated that Commander ___________ Submarine Commander 11 Naval
District, living at 369 Belvedere Street, La Jolla, California, had called
Moorehead's office to report that his wife ___________ had telephonically reported
that she had just seen what she thought was a flying disc at 1110 hours flying
over her home at _________Street, La Jolla, California. The 11th Naval
District was forwarding the information on to this office for our information and
any action we wished to take. This Agent, in company with Special Agent Leo
Klickler, interviewed Mrs. _______ residing at _______Street, La Jolla, California,
at approximately 1505 17 June 1949. Mrs. _______ stated that at approximately
1110 hours 17 June 1949 while standing in her back yard she saw a large (about
size of a Douglas DC-4 Aircraft) round object in the air approximately four miles
southeast of her home in the direction of San Diego, California. Mrs. ______
judged it was about four thousand feet in the air and moving rapidly away from her.
Mrs. Selby stated "It was definitely not a jet aircraft although it's speed was
more in keeping with a jet than the more conventional aircraft". The description
was, according to Mrs. _______ "brChrome plated and it threw much brighter 
than the ordinary aircraft". Mrs. _______ further stated there was definitely no
protrusions (such as wings or visible stabilizers) as the object turned in a wide
arc away from her. When queried regarding smoke or vapor trails Mrs. _______
stated she did not notice any. The object was visible for approximately 30 seconds.

Mrs. ________ is approximately thirty years of age, intelligent and
stable.

Mrs. _________ will contact this office if any further incidents of this nature
occur. Forwarded for your information.

SUBJECT


A week or so ago a Lockheed employee called ███████ to de-
scribe to him his observations of two flying discs over the San 
Fernando Valley, which he swears he saw June 17th of this year.

As you know, I have been very interested in the probability of
such things existing, and my discussions with certain people
in the Air Force, as well as late newspaper reports indicate there
is something to flying discs.

This individual, Mr. ███████, ███████ Avenue,
Los Angeles 26, California, was very anxious that no publicity be 
given his remarks. ███████ knows of my interest in flying discs and 
went down to see Mr. ███████ who was formerly an animator at one 
of the studios. He prepared the enclosed sketch.

I wonder if you would check around at Wright Field and see whether
the Air Force is interested in checking up on reports of this
nature. This man is definitely not a crack-pot, and he has offered 
to anime exactly what he saw if he is given the facilities by 
Lockheed. He is not asking anything for the job; and I don't know
quite what to do about it.

How about seeing if AMC wants to have one of their local repre-
sentatives interview Whitton.

The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch consists of lined patterns that seem to depict a landscape with hills or mountains, and a series of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or dots are scattered across the sky. There are also what appear to be structures or poles drawn vertically on the left-hand side.
