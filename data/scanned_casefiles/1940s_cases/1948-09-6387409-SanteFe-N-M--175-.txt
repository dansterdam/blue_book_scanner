UNCLASSIFIED

Incident 175aa - Santa Fe, New Mexico -- 22 September 1948

The evidence here is so contradictory that it is very
difficult or not to attempt any identification. For example, one
observer states that the object was stationary; the observer that
it was moving at a speed of 700-800 mph. One says the elevation
was 45°; the other says 70°. It is hard to imagine that the;
were looking at the same object, even though it is so stated.

Considering all the statements) alone, it is
possible that the object observed was a planet; Venus. The
location is is given as southwest and the elevation as 70°, which
correspond approximately with the position of Venus at the time.
The magnitude of the planet was -3.3; it could have been visible
in the daylight sky. It would have appeared, however, more like a
pinpoint of light rather than like a "disc in the sky." It seems
unlikely that it would have been noticed at all, but since the ob-
server was looking closely at the sky ("watching" a government plane
come in), he might have chanced upon it.

Considering the vast discrepancies in the two reports, it
may not be amiss to suggest another, far fetched, explanation or
one or both. The moon at that time was in the odious phase, and was a
little of the horizon north of west. It is possible that he would be
thinking of the moon in that position as the object that he saw.

2. REPORT OF FINDINGS

The following information concerning Waco, Texas on 8 October 1948
at Santa Fe, New Mexico on 23 September 1948;

a. Weather at time object was sighted was ceiling and visibility un-
limited. object was first seen at 0945.

b. The only drawing of the object that could be furnished would be a
perfect circle. Therefore, it was deemed unnecessary to obtain a sketch.

c. The object appeared to be a perfect circle, approximately 100 to
150 feet in diameter and white in color. At first the object seemed to move in 
a semi-circle, from South to East and finally to North East. This may have been
an optical illusion. The estimated altitude was 30,000 feet, and because of this
great height, the speed and maneuverability could not be ascertained. During the
period of observation this object made no sound and did not crash in an exhaust
trail. After this observed movement, the object remained stationary.

d. I. Anglar has been a pilot since 1922 and is familiar with all types
of conventional aircraft. He observed this object from 0945 until 0950 and then
again at 1000. These observations were also made by **** and **** in the vicinity
of Santa Fe, New Mexico.

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAAX,
dated 29 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents' summaries 173 through 233 was been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are enclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 15, "Discussion
of Flight or Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion in a
specified area direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Planting to said Agency," should include a statement of the type of 
radar set used.

"""
No. 175; Pilot balloon sounding released from Albuquerque at same
time as observation. Upper winds show WNW flow hence could not have been
the AB balloon. Great differences of opinion exist as to speed and shape
of the object. One observer states that the object was not a weather
balloon. All evidence indicates that this is true. Conclusion: Not a
balloon.

Name and address of observer: -------------- El Paso, Texas

Occupation and hobbies:
Neon Sign Manufacturer - own employer. A pilot
since 1925.

Comments of Interviewer relative to reliability and character of
observer: ---------- is approx 50 yrs of age, well settled and conducts
his own business. He is an experienced pilot, comes from a middle-class family, 
is a little above average in intelligence and is a good conversationalist.
He told a straight forward story and did not contradict himself. He appeared
sincere in his conviction that he saw an unconventional aircraft. He was can-
vinced the object was not a weather balloon since he is familiar with weather
balloons.

1427 MST 25 Jul. 47:
While watching a government plane come in for a landing
at Los Alamos at Oglio hours 23 Sept 1946, ----------- noticed something glint
in the sun. Focusing his attention on the object he perceived that it was
metallic white, neither transparent nor translucent and that it had no
particular sheen. It was particular observed from a distance which appeared
low as a coin would appear when dropped, the side visible. It bore being 
larger than a dime. Moving it up in relation to the tip of the radio tower
he back od off to the north. The object appeared clear out of the picture in 
relation to the tower. Using this perspective he judged the altitude to be
approximately 30,000 ft. At that altitude the object would necessarily be
some 100 to 150 feet in size in order to be visible at all. There were no
projections, aerials, or exhaust of any kind. -------- then led the object
to the attainment of maximum his monocular, both men leaned on into a
building, transacted their business, and at the end of eight minutes, went
outside and again perceived the object in approximately the same position. 
Within the same limits saw the object; to his last observation was approx-
imately 15 to 20 minutes. ------- also corroborates the statement
with that of Mr. ---------- (175A) reveals discrepancies in that Mr
-------- places the date of sighting as 23 Sept whereas Mr. ----------- states the
date to be 25 Sept 46. Mr. -------- thought the object appeared to be moving
in a semicircle. He also stated that it was visible for approximately 15 to 20
minutes; that it left no air trail or exhaust and that it moved from South to 
North and finally to Northeast. Mr ---------- stated that the object was 
moving at an estimated speed of from 700 to 800 MPH and that it emitted a blue
glare to the rear. Mr. ---------- stated the object was moving in a direction
from northeast to southwest.

Page 2 Incident: 175A

Name and address of observer: Mr. ████████████

Occupation and hobbies: Building Superintendant, drawing, mechanical
inclinations, also woodworking & photography

Comments of Investigator relative to intelligence and character of
observer(s): A check of the criminal and subversive files of the local
field office of the FBI revealed no information pertaining to █████████

NARRATIVE SUMMARY

████████ saw a bright silvery oblong or egg-shaped object which
appeared to have a speed of 700 to 800 MPH and which seemed to have a
sort of sunflower shape at the end of it but apart from it and close on
its tail. He perceived a bluish appearance to rear of the object which
could have been exhaust. To him the object appeared silvery instead of
white and oblong rather than round. It appeared though the object remained
stationary or that it moved to move in a semi-circle from south to east
and finally to northeast. Mr. ████████████ stated that the direction of flight
was from northeast to southwest.
