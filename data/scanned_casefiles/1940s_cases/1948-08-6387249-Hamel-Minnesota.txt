Dear Captain Wotter

On August 11, 1948, this office received a
letter from Mr. E. W. Sheridan, Postmaster, Hamel, Minnesota,
which reads as follows:

"A farmer, who lives a short distance from this vil-
lage, reported to this office that his two sons, aged 8
& 10, had been playing near their dad's job, which
looked like two plates inverted piled to the ground
about eight feet from one of the boys. When it hit the
ground it pounded very rapidly and disappeared.

"This object came in from the northwest & disappeared to
the northeast. It was a silver colored object. Evident-
ly this farmer believes what his sons saw some object and
I have no reason to doubt his word. For your information."

This matter is being referred to you for what-
ever action you deem advisable. No investigation is being conducted
by this office.

Very truly yours,

/s/ M. B. Rhodes

ACTION TAKEN ON HAMEL, MINN, INCIDENT

Reference letter 17 Aug 1948 from Eq 5th Army, received MCIA(X)2-3 on
20 August 1948, pertaining to incident in Hamel, Minnesota, the following
action has been taken:

On 20 Aug 48 a call was placed to Hq, 5th Army, contacting Lt Col
William B. Allison, Executive Officer, G-2. Colonel Allison informed
this Headquarters that action would be taken to resurvey the incident
and to accomplish photographic and earth-sample investigations of
the area in which the incident occurred.

On 21 August (Saturday) a call was received by Capt Gordon from a
Major Morgan of Gq, 5th Army, informing Capt Gordon (MCIA(X)-3) that
the incident occasioned by the missile had been covered since the
indication. Unfortunately, however, since the occurrence there had been
two or three heavy rainfalls and the depression in the ground previously
ly noted was found to be 1/3 full of water. Photographic coverage was
made, however, and samples of rocks and earth in the depression were
extracted. This evidence was being forwarded to 5th Army HQ Area as
of Tuesday the 24th and will be forwarded this office (MCIA(X)-3)
immediately upon receipt, and should arrive t/is Hq by the end of the 
week.

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

Gentlemen:

Accompanying this letter is a small sample of soil. The soil was taken from a depression reported to have been caused by a "flying saucer" described as being approximately two feet in diameter and one foot thick which reportedly settled gently to the ground, resounded to a height of about twenty feet and then continued on its journey. Although the density was immediately covered by a large rainfall a heavy rain subsequently filled the depression about one/half full of water before any sample of dirt could be taken.

In an effort to approach this incident objectively to determine every possible clue, it has been deemed advisable to have this soil sample analyzed and tested. In inquiry, your Dayton representative stated that the FBI Laboratory would accomplish the required tests.

It is the desire of this headquarters to ascertain, in particular, if there are traces of unusual elements or alloys adhering to the surface of the particles, or if any abnormality in structure exists showing that the soil was subjected to intense heat, gases or radioactive substances, etc. Unfortunately, in this regard, no one thought to forward a sample of the soil surrounding the depression so no comparison of soils can be made at this time. Should the subsequent tests show anything unusual some arrangement along this to obtaining some of the surrounding soil so that a comparative analysis could be made. The accompanying sample has not been tested by any other agency, nor will it be.

---

Incident No. 162 -- 11 August 1945, 1200 Hours, Hamel, Minnesota,
Two children, ages ten and eight, described a dull gray object two
feet in diameter and one foot thick, shaped like two platters face to face
which settled gently to the ground. It emitted no sound when it hovered. 
On the ground it emitted a whistling noise when it "swiftly flew"
where it hesitated, whistled once more, "shot" up to thirty feet, then 
"shot" off in a northeast direction.

ATIC Opinion: This apparent bit of fantasy is hardly worth further
consideration.
