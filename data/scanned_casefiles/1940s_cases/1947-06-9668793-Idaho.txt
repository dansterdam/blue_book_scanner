Incident #28 -- Idaho -- 24 June 1947

    Any probable astronomical explanation for this incident
is dependent upon the hour of observation, which is not stated in
the information given with the summary.

    An unconfirmed statement (by Mr. [REDACTED], quoted in material
submitted relative to incident #1) that the observation was made
at 3:30 P.M. allows for no possible astronomical explanation other
than that a persistent meteor train might have been observed. Such a 
phenomonon might have given the general impression suggested by the
limited description of the incident.

    If, however, the observation occurred during the early
evening hours, shortly after sunset, which occurred that day at
about 8:00 P.M. local time, then it is extremely likely that the ob-
server saw either the planet Saturn or Mercury. Mercury set al-
most exactly an hour after the sun and was of stellar magnitude +1.
Saturn, of magnitude +0.6 and hence about once again as bright as
Mercury, set two hours after the sun. A bright planet, shining through
thin cirrus clouds could give the impression of a "comet-like object."

There is no discernible photograph present in the provided image. The document image is highly faded and the text is nearly illegible. Despite this, I can attempt to transcribe the partially readable text as best as I can:

"... he observed the four-like object through the [...]
Telescope for roughly [...] 45 seconds to 1 minute. He stated that the object didn't leave any vapor [...]
however, and that he [...] observed in the vicinity of the object [...]
tended to indicate the location of the air motion of the earth [...]"

The poor quality and low contrast of the image prevent an accurate and complete transcription of the text. It appears there are also three holes punched into the paper â€“ two on the left side and one at the bottom, indicating it was stored in a binder or similar filing system. The text and context suggest it is a portion of an observation or a report from Project Blue Book regarding an object observed through a telescope.

Investigations by this headquarters reveal that a synoptic weather balloon could have been at the location where sightings were reported in the following incidents. In compiling this list consideration was given to the wind direction and speed at the surface and aloft at the scheduled time of balloon release, and the location of the nearest weather station taking balloon observations.

          Washington 25, D. C.
          ATTN: DCS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investi-
gation and interpretation of data relative to sightings of unidentified
flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the file
of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendations as to those
which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine
synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological
Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached
may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that
has been asked to assist in the accomplishments of Project "SIGN" except
that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball-
lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are
conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are
coordinated by the Intelligence Department of the Command. These coorg-
eneously made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, MCIAO-3. These
checks are made direct from the cook of synoptic balloon flights made by
weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department
of Commerce (U.S. Weather Bureau), regulated to Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed inci-
dents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This
list does not eliminate the possibility that any of the remaining
incidents are balloons.
