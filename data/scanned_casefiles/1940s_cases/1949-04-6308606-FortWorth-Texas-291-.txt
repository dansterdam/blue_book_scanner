Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Re radars now operating on ground

    a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size of target:

    b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180°), etc., and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observable, how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed?

    c. Note particularly any separation of distant targets into several targets upon approach:

    d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent with size of object; faint; fading; pulsating at regular rate:

    e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted

    a. Were there any radar indications or extra noises on radio circuits:

    b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.:

CARSWELL FLIGHT SERVICE CENTER

Fort Worth, Texas

AFD-1c1yb

14 April 1949

FTD 319.1

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Objects

TO: Commanding General
Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson AFB Base, Ohio

Attention: MCIAO-X

1. In compliance with FB Regulation 200-2, subject "Unidentified
Flying Objects" dated 2 November 1948, in reference to letter, Headquarters,
UAF, subject "Reporting of Information on 'Flying Discs,' " dated
6 February 1949, the following report is submitted.

2. An unidentified flying object was seen over Fort Worth, Texas,
on 13 April 1949, at approximately 2105C, by 1st lt Robert A. Franus, who called it to the attention of Captain Stanley Borowski. Both
officers are assigned to the Carswell Flight Service Center, Carswell
Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas.

3. Subject officers had just returned from a local flight and
were standing by their aircraft on the flight line. The weather at that
time was bright daylight reported by Carswell Air Force Base was clear
and visibility of eight miles.; No photograph ers available. One object
was round and in the shape of a bell, very silver in color. It was
traveling at a tremendous rate of pseudo, estimated to be over 1000
miles per hour, altitude was very hard to judge and cannot be estimated
correctly; however, object seemed to be clearly visible. Northwest
Airlines Sam co-pilot used were on the ramp in the Main Maintenance
direction, it seemed to fly horizontally in the direction of south-
south-east. It did not appear to burn out, but suddenly disappeared.
No sound was heard. The exhaust trail seemed to be approximately three
times the size of the object and also was silver in color. The exhaust
consisted of silver streaks and star shaped figures. The object definitely
did not appear to be a jet or meteor. Its speed was far in excess of
an jet saw or witnessed by observers at the time who took part
in any number of new aerodynamics. A check of Carswell Flight Service
Flight following rocks showed no jet aircraft flying in this area at
Time object was sighted.

Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Re radars now operating on ground

   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size
      of target:

   b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180°), etc.,
      and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observa-
      ble, how long did the target stay in the turn and what was
      its speed?

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into
      several targets upon approach:

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consis-
      tent with size of object; faint; fading; pulsating at regu-
      lar rate:

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted

   a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio cir-
      cuits:

   b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.

GENERAL

craft flying in vicinity at the time:
(Check Canadian activity if close to border)

No aircraft known to be in the vicinity.

4. Possible releases of testing devices in vicinity sent aloft by
Ordnance, NAVY, Air Force, Army, Weather Units, Research organizations
or any other; obtain computed or observed data not of own (the-
odolite, radar, photographs, etc.). Carswell AFB Weather Station released one 
350 or 500 gram weather balloon with a T-69 type transmitter attached by
approx 1600' of cord. The original computation sheet, S.C. 425, which was submitted 
to CO, 2059th Air Weather Wing, Tinker AFB, indicates route of T-69 transmitter.

5. If object contacted earth, obtain soil samples within and without 
depression or spot where object landed for purposes of making com-
parison of soils.

6. Obtain photographs (or original negatives) when available; if
not, secure sketches of:
   a. Object
   b. Surrounding terrain where object was observed
   c. Place where object contacted earth (if this happened)
   d. Maneuvers
   e. Formation (if more than two)

7. Secure signed statements.

8. Obtain fragments or physical evidence where possible.
