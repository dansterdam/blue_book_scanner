________________    UNCLASSIFIED

The document is labeled as "UNCLASSIFIED" at both the top and the bottom. It appears to be a standardized form used for reporting an incident, specifically marked as "Incident #234", with fields for various details of the observation, including the location, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the date of information being July of 1947. There is a note in the "SKETCHES" field indicating that photographs associated with this incident were not actual images of an object but were due to faulty development.

- page 1 -

The photograph appears to show an outdoor scene with a very faded image quality. There are buildings visible, and it seems to be daylight. There is a bright spot that could be an artifact of the photo development process or lens flare. The contrast is very low, making details hard to distinguish.

Unfortunately, due to the poor quality and low resolution of the provided image, I am unable to accurately transcribe any text or offer a clear description of details within the photograph. If the text within the document is necessary, a clearer image or scan would be required for accurate optical character recognition (OCR).

- page 2 -

The image contains a sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch appears to be an interpretation of a reported unidentified flying object (UFO). The image features a series of vertical lines or shapes with a horizontal base, suggesting a structured object with a flat bottom and protruding elements.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I'll transcribe the handwritten text found in the document:

---

Oak Ridge Tennessee Submit july 1947

actually
a development
plan, but
Submitted as
genuine UFO
sighting

Oak Ridge

---

Please note that handwriting recognition can be less accurate than printed text recognition. The transcription provided is my best attempt at interpreting the handwritten text in the image.

- page 3 -

The image appears to be a poorly preserved or reproduced photograph or document, with much of its detail lost due to overexposure, low resolution, or degradation. It seems to contain areas of lighter and darker patches, but specific details cannot be made outâ€”it is not possible to discern any clear objects or text within the photograph with confidence.

The text in the document at the bottom reads:
"UNCLASSIFIED"

- page 4 -

The image appears to be a faded black-and-white photograph of an outdoor scene. There are utility poles with wires running across the top portion of the image, and what seem to be buildings visible in the background, possibly houses or other small structures. The photo quality is poor, with low contrast, and parts of the image are difficult to discern. There is considerable noise, smudges, or grain throughout, which may be due to the age or condition of the original document or the scanning process. There's no distinct representation of any object that might be identified as a UFO visible in this image. In the lower part of the image, there seems to be some kind of field or open land, but no details can be made out clearly. Some markings appear at the bottom right of the image, maybe writing or numbering, but they are illegible.

There is no text present within the body of the image, so there is nothing to reproduce as if I were an OCR system for this specific visual content.

- page 5 -

The photograph present on the document appears to be very faded and unclear. It seems there might be a central object that could be a saucer or disk-shaped anomaly in the sky with a very faint outline. However, due to the poor quality and washed-out nature of the photograph, it's difficult to discern precise details. The rest of the photograph is mostly obscured by graininess and lacks clear features.

As for the text, there does not appear to be any text within the image frame that is provided. If there is text outside of the photograph's border within the document, it is not visible in the image you've shared. Therefore, I'm unable to provide an OCR output for any text outside of the photograph.

- page 6 -

The photograph shows a suburban landscape with houses and utility poles. The image quality is very poor, with low contrast and a significant amount of noise or grain, making it difficult to discern details. There appears to be a light or washed-out area in the sky portion that could be construed as an anomaly, but the image quality makes it impossible to determine the nature and cause of this washed-out area definitively. There is a word "UNCLASSIFIED" at the bottom edge of the photograph.

Given the quality of the image, optical character recognition (OCR) will be extremely challenging, and no legible text can be produced from the photograph as presented.

- page 7 -

The image appears to be a black and white photograph. It shows a rectangular area dominated by various shades of gray with some patterns that could be artifacts or damage. The photograph is very grainy and it does not have clear details that discern specific objects or shapes.

In the lower right corner of the image, there is the word "UNCLASSIFIED."

As per the request, I'll now act as an OCR system and output the text found in the document:

```
UNCLASSIFIED
```

- page 8 -

The image shows a photograph that is quite faded and unclear. The photograph predominantly features grayscale tones with no distinguishable features or objects due to its poor quality or degradation over time. It is difficult to make out any specific details within the photograph.

Below the photograph, there appears to be the word "UNCLASSIFIED" indicating the classification status of the document or image. 

The text content as requested using OCR output format:

UNCLASSIFIED

- page 9 -

The photograph appears to be a black and white image with significant degradation or poor quality, making details hard to discern. There seem to be some vertical structures that could be buildings or towers on the left side, and a blend of darker areas and lighter areas throughout the image, but specific details are not clear due to the quality.

Here is the text from the document:

OAK RIDGE, TENN.
JULY '47

- page 10 -

The photograph in the document appears to show an outdoor scene with structures and a utility pole. In the sky above, there appears to be a blurred, elongated object flying overhead that could align with the context of a UFO report.

1. The negatives forwarded with basic communication are returned herewith.

2. Analysis of the negatives revealed the following information:

   a. When the negative, containing the sphere, is examined by
strong incident light, it is noted that the emulsion is raised at that 
point above the normal level of the remaining emulsion. This indicates
that either a drop of warm water or a drop of developer struck the film
at this point and rolled down this negative and the succeeding negative.

   b. To further substantiate this, it will be noted that when
the two (2) negatives are placed side by side with the edges of the film
aligned, the so-called "trail" is continuous, that is the two sections
match, indicating the drop rolled on from one negative to the next.

   c. Still further proof is shown on the fogged edge of the
negative containing only the trail. This is proven by the fact that the
trail extends beyond the normal format of the negative. In other words
there is a trail of that section of the negative which was not exposed in
the camera. This effect shows up in one negative and not in the other
because the negative in question is fogged; therefore, this irregularity
was developed.

   d. Still further proof of there defects lies in the number
of unevenly developed sections of the negative.

3. It is suggested that the be advised of the nature of
the images when the negatives are returned to him.

4. In view of the positive conclusions stated above it is recommend-
ed that this correspondence be declassified by the originator.

Subject: PHOTOGRAPHS

Dear Sir:

In compliance with your recent request, there are enclosed eight photographs and two negatives received from [redacted]. Also enclosed are four enlarged copies of the photograph and four copies of the News-Sentinel news item published in a July 1947 issue.

[redacted] when interviewed, stated that he photographed the unknown object from his home during the month of July 1947. He stated further that he forwarded a copy of the photograph to the Knoxville News Sentinel, Knoxville, Tennessee, for publication. [redacted] said he did not believe a photograph of the object to be of any interest to Security; therefore, he did make prints of the photographs a few months later, at which time he presented a number of them to his friends. [redacted] promised to recover as many prints as possible and forward them to this office. He did mention, however, that he would like, if at all possible, to have the negatives returned to him when available.

All photographs, when made available by [redacted] will be forwarded to your office.

If this office can be of any further assistance in this matter, please do not hesitate to call upon us.

Very truly yours,

In reply to paragraph 1, comment No. 2, it is the opinion of this office that the enclosed negatives reveal the following information: When the negative, containing the apparent "trails" was not level when it was taken, it is much more normal that emulsions rise at there is extreme unfavorable incident light, it is enough to state that the emulsion is raised either a drop of warm water or a drop of developer struck the film at this point and rolled down this negative and the succeeding negative.

2. To further substantiate this, it will be noted that when the two (2) negatives are placed side by side with the edges of the film aligned, the so called "trail" is continuous, that is the two sections match, indicating the drop rolled on from one negative to the next.

3. Still further proof is shown on the fogged edge of the negative containing only the trail. This is proven by the fact that the trail extends beyond the normal foreat of the negative. In other words there is a trail of that section of the negative which was not exposed in the camera. This effect shows up in one negative and not the other because the negative in question is fogged, therefore, this irregularity was developed.

4. Still further proof of these effects lies in the number of unevenly developed sections of the negative.

5. Conclusion: These negatives contain no information pertinent to Project "Sign".
