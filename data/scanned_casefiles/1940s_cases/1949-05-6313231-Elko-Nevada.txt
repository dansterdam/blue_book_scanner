DETAILS:

1. This investigation was requested by District Commander, 16th District OSI (IG), USAF, Hill Air Force Base, Ogden, Utah, and was predicated upon a report that Mr. ***** Communications Chief, Elko Airport, Nevada, had observed five (5) vee shaped objects flying in the vicinity of Elko, Nevada.

AT ELKO, NEVADA

2. Investigation conducted at Civil Aeronautics Administration, U. S. Department of Commerce, Elko, Nevada, on 7 June 1949, revealed that Mr. HASKINS is not employed at the Elko Airport, but is a Yard Clerk for the Western Pacific Railroad Company, Elko, Nevada. Mr. YALE D. HASKINS, Aircraft Communicator, CAA, stated he had received the report from HASKINS by telephone and produced a file copy of the message which he (HASKINS) forwarded to Salt Lake (Exhibit A) and which read as follows:

Report from Western Pacific Cfc.

Mr. ***** Yard Clerk reports sighting a series of five objects in V-shaped formation at about 1,000 feet traveling west bound at a high rate of speed. No sound accompanied them. Sighted over Elko. Time of sighting 0200P. He adw could have been large plane with swept wings or five objects. Objects were lighted.

The copy of the message on file at the CAA office bears a time stamp indicating it was sent at 0245 FST on 29 May 1949. HASKINS stated he was not sure of the exact time he received the telephonic report from HENRICH, but it had been between 0200 hours and 0230 hours on 29 may 1949.

3. Review of the communication files maintained at the Civil Aeronautics Administration, Elko, Nevada, revealed that the following aircraft were in the vicinity of Elko, Nevada at times indicated on 29 May 1949:

4. Review of the files maintained at the Weather Bureau, U. S. Department of Commerce, Elko, Nevada: Latitude 40°50'N; Longitude 115° 47'W revealed the following information relative to weather conditions on 29 May 1949:

   a. 0132 PST; broken clouds at 7000 feet; visibility 15 miles; wind west at 3 miles per hour; temperature 52°F; Dewpoint 42°F.

   b. 0207 PST; broken clouds at 7000 feet; visibility 15 miles; wind southwest at 8 miles per hour.

   c. 0230 PST; broken clouds at 7000 feet; visibility 15 miles; wind southwest at 8 miles per hour; temperature 47°F; Dewpoint 41°F; occasional lightning west of Elko.

   d. 0306 PST; scattered clouds at 7000 feet; visibility 30 miles; wind southwest at 11 miles per hour; occasional lightning west of Elko.

5. On 8 June 1949, Mr. [redacted], Yard Clerk, Western Pacific Railroad Company, Elko, Nevada, was interviewed at his home, near Elko, Nevada, and the following statement (Exhibit B) was obtained:

   At approximately two A.M., on the morning of May 29, 1949, while attending to routine duties in the freight yard of the Western Pacific Railroad Company in Elko, I noticed five ember colored lights approximately five miles distant and at an altitude of 10000 feet. The lights were in a vee formation about 150 feet apart and heading West at a speed of over 500 miles per hour. I could hear no sound and there were no visible signs of exhaust. The lights were steady, giving the appearance of being seen through a window, rather than that of a ray beam. When they disappeared it was as if an obstruction or projection on an aircraft had come into my line of vision.

   I do not know how long the lights were within my sight or the distance they covered during that period. I could not distinguish any outline around them and do not know whether they came from very large aircraft or five smaller ones flying in formation.

The only portion of [redacted]'s statement made with assurance was that he had seen five (5) lights traveling West in vee-formation and had heard no sound.

At approximately two A.M. on the morning of May 29, 1949, while attending to routine duties in the freight yard of the Western Pacific Railroad Company in Elko, I noticed five amber colored lights approximately five miles distant and at an altitude of 10,000 feet. The lights were in a very formation about 150 feet apart and heading West at a speed of over 500 miles per hour. I could hear no sound and there were no visible signs of exhaust. The lights were steady, giving the appearance of being seen through a window, rather than of a ray or beam. When they disappeared it was as if an obstruction or projection on an aircraft had come into my line of vision.

I do not know how long the lights were within my sight or the distance they covered during that period. I could not distinguish any outline around them and do not know whether they came from one very large aircraft or five smaller ones flying in formation.

The foregoing statement is true to the best of my knowledge and recollection.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

At approximately two A.M. on the morning of May 29, 19.., while attending to routine duties in the freight yard of the Western Pacific Railroad Company in Elko, I noticed five amber colored lights approximately five miles distant and at an altitude of 10000 feet. The lights were in a Vee formation about 150 feet apart and heading west at a speed of over 500 miles per hour. I could hear no sound and there were no visible signs of exhaust. The lights were steady, giving the appearance of being seen through a window, rather than that of a ray or beam. When they disappeared it was as if an obstruction or projection on an aircraft had come into my line of vision.

I do not know how long the lights were within my sight or the distance they covered during that period. I could not distinguish any outline around them and do not know whether they came from one very large aircraft or five smaller ones flying in formation.
