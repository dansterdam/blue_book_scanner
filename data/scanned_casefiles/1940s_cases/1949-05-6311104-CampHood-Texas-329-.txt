DETAILS:

1. On 7 May 1949, Captain DUROAL C. PERKINS, Asst. G-3, 2nd
Armored Division, observed an unusual light at Camp Hood, Texas.
Captain PERKINS, at approximately 2130 hours, was validating a map coordi-
nate 913.5 - 854.5 and saw an object brighter than the stars. Object
remained stationary for approximately thirty-five (35) minutes, was
round and twice the size of the brightest star visible. Color varied,
being predominantly white, varying to blue with flashes of red. No
maneuvers were observed, and the weather was generally fair with
scattered clouds and a wind from the south, velocity of abut 15 miles
per hour. Observer followed object both with the naked eye and through
field glasses. The standard form "Guide to Investigation, Unidentified
Aerial Objects" has been furnished AIC and copy is retained in files of
District Office No. 10.

2. On 23 May 1949, Lieut. TOHI S. GROSSCLOSS, 1st Company G, 6th
Tank Battalion, 2nd Armored Division, Camp Hood, Texas, observed an
unusual light. Observation was made at 2210 hours from Observation
Post No. 1, map coordinates 913.5-854.5. GROSSCLOSS saw one light about
three feet in diameter, round in shape, and changing from amber to
greenish yellow in color. The object was in sight for approximately
two to three minutes, and was about 1,500 yards from the Observer.
Speed was slow and object appeared to grow. No measurements were made.
Observation was made without assistance of optical instruments. Object
was north of the observer and traveled from east to west, then from
west to east. Pvt. V.E. HAFFORD, Company "H", 14th AIB, 2nd Armored
Division, Camp Hood, Texas, made observation at the same point and at
the same time, and described the object as being two or three feet in
diameter, smaller than the moon, was round and was red when first seen,
then changed to a greenish color. Object was in sight for two to three
minutes, travelied from east to west, then from west to east, disappearing, 
then re-appearing, moving slowly when first sighted, travelling some-
what faster on second observation. Flight was level and the object
appeared to glow like a "light through a window". No optical instru-
ments were used in the observation.

3. On 23 May Pvt. JAMES F. GEBDER, Company "H", 424 AIB, 2nd
Armored Division, Camp Hood, Texas, while on guard at Observation
Post no. 1, map coordinates 913.5-854.5, observed unusual lights. Time
of observation was 2330 hours, and this object seen was one light which
re-appeared approximately twenty times, described as being round, about
the size of a half dollar. Color was similar to that of a light bulb.
Object was in sight for several seconds and moved straight up and down.

4. On 23 May 1949, at approximately 1000 hours, Sgt. JACKIE E. PARKER, 66th Medium Tank Battalion, 6th Company, Camp Hood, Texas, and PFC JOHN T. OWENS, "B" Company, 66th Medium Tank Battalion, Camp Hood, Texas, were on duty at Observation Post No. 1, map coordinates 910-95650, and observed an object at about 45Â° an angle between the size of a star and the moon, described as being mobile and light. It was round with blurred edges and had a yellowish tinge to its color. Object was more than a mile away and was north-east of the observers; remained in sight for one or two minutes and moved from left to right at a slow speed. Obs object was dull like a flashflight covered by yellow paper". weather was clear with a light wind from the south, with a small amount of haze. No optical instruments were used. Object moved in level flight, top middle directly to ADC by Fourth Army, and copy retained in files of O. O. No. 10.

5. On 23 May 1949, between the hours 2330 and 0030, three observers saw a revolving light, colors were white red, orange, blue. BERNARD, Jr. Hq & Sv Co., 142 AIC, Camp Hood, Texas; Pvt. MILTON SHUBIN, Company I, 7 ARB, Camp Hood, Texas; and Pvt. IVAN E. FISCHER, 111th M. D., Company, 12 ARB, Camp Hood, Texas, and upon re-appeared several times. Described as being the size of a light bulb when held at arm's length, revolved in shape, and with a color of that of a light bulb at a distance. Time of sighting was approximately one minute, and movement was straight up and down at slow speed, weather was clear with southerly winds and a slight haze. No sound or odor was observed, no trail noted, and no projections seen on object by observers. Individual reports from each of the three observers furnished ADC by Fourth Army with copy being retained in the files of D. O. No. 10.

6. On the night of 3 June,1949, at 2200 hours, a civilian type aircraft circled Camp Hood at an altitude of from 200 to 300 feet. At completion of second circling, airplane was headed due east. Pilot in attempting to land on patrol road which he had mistaken for an air strip, struck the No. 1 fence of the restricted area and caused the plane to crash, but did not burn. Pilot stated he was enroute from Paris to Taylor, Texas, when his plane developed engine trouble requiring him to make an emergency landing. The plane was searched thoroughly and no evidence of cameras or explosives determined.

As the result of the emergency landing, four fence posts bent completely
out of shape, and forty-five feet of fencing badly mangled, torn loose
and stretched.  As the pilot was a civilian, the matter was referred
to the F. B. I., and a report submitted from San Antonio Field Office
of that organization indicates the pilot to have been CHARLES DEVINE
CARLOT, residing at 1316 Wallace Street, Taylor Texas.  The aircraft
was a Bellanca Monowing, red in color, No. 1403.  Investigation by
the F. B. I. indicated nothing unfavorable regarding subject's loyalty
to the United States.

7. On 6 June 1949, 1st Lieut. VIRGIL M. WILLIAMS, l3####th Balcony,
AAFBA BN, and 2nd Lieut. MARTIN L. JONES, HQ Battery, 4th AAA Bn,
Camp Hood, Texas, observed aerial light.  The observers were at Artillery
OP No. 2, Camp Hood, Texas, map coordinates 9133-6955-7530.  Time of ob-
servation was approximately 2107 hours.  Object was in sight for two
minutes and forty seconds.  Object was described as being initially one,
disintegrating into smaller particles and last slightly.  The size was
2 to 3 inches in 50C scope.  Object was approximately one mile above
the surface, described as being yellow emitting dual or orange glow
color, similar to a ball of fire.  Object observed through BC Scope,
and initially appeared stationary, then moved in low flight, being
tracked with constant turns on BC Scope.  The object seemed to disinte-
grate into smaller objects which disappeared in a fraction of a second.
The sky was overcast, but the object was described as being dull as a
flashlight with black-out disk.  No sound or odor was observed.

8. Same date object was observed by Lieut. EDWARD G. RAYNERT, ****

Bn., Camp Hood, Texas, from Artillery OP Post 10, Camp Hood,
Texas, map cordinates 915.390 - 657.700.  The second set of observers
indicated the object to have been one, perhaps two side by side, round
in shape and yellow or orange in color.  Size was about that of a dime
held at arms length.  Observers stated object was fairly dull until
it burst, and upon bursting parts went up and down and faded out.  No. 1 observed object on an azimuth of 20 mils, and No. 2 observed
on an azimuth 2771 mils.  Report on form "Guide to Investigation,

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION                                          DATE: 2 July 1949

PREPARING OFFICE: Office of the AC of S, G-2, Hq Fourth Array, Fort Sam
Houston, Texas

SUBJECT: Summary of Observations of
Aerial Phenomena, Camp Hood, Texas

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

Beginning 6 March 1949, a series of aerial phenomena has been observed
in the vicinity of the Restricted area at Camp Hood, Texas. For want of a
better application, this phenomena has by common consent been tagged "Balls
of Fire." The phenomena has occurred at Camp Hood on the average of every
nine days since it began. Complete reports of each incident have been
reported in detail to the Commanding General Air Material Command, by direc-
tion of the Director of Intelligence, (25 March 1949). Detailed reports of
numerous similar phenomena at Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and
Los Alamos, New Mexico, have already been made direct to the Director of
Intelligence.

Observations made at Camp Hood indicates

The "Fire balls" are highly luminous "lights" usually greenish-white
but sometimes orange-red in color.

They are usually round but are sometimes diamond or oblong shape.

Some move and some appear to be fixed "stars" disappearing as
the terrain; on and off of an electric switch. The movement has been reported
as in an arc, vertical, and zig-zag.

Observations always occur on the same or consecutive nights--the
shortest observation period is two nights and the longest three. The
smallest number of individual phenomenons reported during any period of
manifestations has been 4 and the largest 50.

When artillery observation and plotting methods were used, the
following data was obtained by triangulation: On 7 May 1949, from 1910 hours
to 2105 hours. Weather was clear and a bright moonlight night.

Diamond shaped fireball, red to greenish white, 15 yards in
diameter and 1,000 feet high, moved approximately 100 yards
horizontally in 57 seconds and appeared to "go out."

Diamond shaped fire ball, 24 yards in diameter and 1,300 feet
high, moved approximately 120 yards horizontally in 140 minutes
and then appeared to "go out."

Diamond shaped fire ball, 16 yards in diameter and 1,600 feet
high, moved horizontally in 9 minutes and then appeared to
"go out."

It was in sight for approximately two to three seconds, moving very
fast, faster than a jet plane. Guide to Investigation of Unidentified
Copy of report on standard form "Critics" was in; downward, direction filed
Aerial Objects", furnished directly to ATIC and copy retained in files
of D.O. No. 10.

10. On 13 June, Captain EDWARD J. RUPPELT, Hq. 92d AI^R Bn, Camp
Hood, Texas, at approximately 2100 hours observed a brilliant light
in the sky. Observer was sitting in the patio in the rear of the
Camp Hood Officers Club and saw no brilliance light similar to a
meteorite. Estimated size 100 to 700 feet, with a tail extending to
150 rear 1000 yards. The object was green in color, while the tail was
colour yellow and green. "Observer estimated object to be 10 to 15
miles distant, moving at a speeds of 5,000 feet per second. Direction
of flight was west to southwest. Object was in sight from 5 to 10
seconds. Object was described as being three times the brilliancy
of a meteorite. Weather was clear, ceiling and visibility unlimited,
Complete report on form Hq 93720 "Critics" is on file and identified
Objects" furnished to ATIC by Fourth Army and a copy is retained in
in the files of D.O. No. 10.

11. This same object was also observed by Major ALEXANDER B.
McCORMICK, Hq. 749th AFA Bn, Camp Hood, Texas, from the patio in the
rear of the Camp Hood Officers' Club. Observer could not estimate
the size of the object, but stated it was round with a tail. Color
described from front to rear as being green, red, dark red, purple,
with dark out it end. Object was in sight approximately 30 seconds,
during which time it covered one-half and in its total an a meteoritical
bearc, arced 80 miles of sky overhead. Size is as resolved along metal
subjects at University of Oklahoma, and stated he definitely believed
object sighted was not a meteorite, and riding by the color of its
trail, observer believed object was burning a fuel of hydro-carbon
base. Copy of report has been furnished to ATIC, and a copy is re-
tained in the files of D. O. No. 10.

12. On 7 July 1949, l0th District OSl was advised by Major
PERRY C. WINN, "G-2" Section, Headquarters Fourth Army, that a request
had been directed through channels for the assistance of a 'Technical
Intelligence Team from Air Material Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, in

UNCLASSIFIED

S/I, Office of the AC of S, G-2, Headquarters Fourth Army, Fort Sam Houston,
Texas, 2 July 1949, subj. "Summary of Observations of Aerial Phenomena, Camp
Hood, Texas"

No sound or odor has ever accompanied the phenomena.

All observed groups of phenomena have "bracketed" the restricted area.

Over 100 men and officers have observed and reported the phenomena
(including field rates and college graduates).

Flights of aircraft and all firing and training schedules have been
checked and rechecked without a single such incident having been found 
that coincides in time and place with any of the observed phenomena.

No explanation of this phenomena is known to nor has any been
presented to this headquarters. In the absence of scientific equipment
and observers, it appears that no explanation is foreseeable.
