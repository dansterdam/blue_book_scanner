"CHARLOTTE OBSERVER - 30 December 1949

200-Mile Straight Line Marks Mystery Trail Of Strange Craft Over Carolinas

TINKERTY, Dec. 29—(AP)—A straight line on a map, extending 200 miles across the Carolinas, today marked the mystery-ridden trail of a strange flying object.

The object first was seen for 'approxiately' the time of an aircraft base at about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday. Within a half-hour, scores of residents in Hamlet, Chesterfield, S. C., and Greensboro, S. C., reported sighting it on its eerie flight through the western sky.

NO EXPLANATION
There was no explanation today of what the thing could have been, but observers attached significance to the fact that its path was straight for 200 miles. They noted also that after its 4:30 p.m. appearance at Fayetteville, it was seen at Hamlet 35 miles away, a few minutes later, and at Greensboro, more than 150 miles away, shortly after 5 p.m.

Descriptions of the flying object varied. At Fayetteville, it looked like a very fast moving light. At Hamlet it appeared to be a dirigible standing on end. And at Greensboro, a pilot who "chased" it in a light plane said it looked like a smoke trail coming from an unseen plane.

Ground observers at all four cities spoke of it "drifting" into the di-
rection of the setting sun. They said they were able to follow its southwestward flight for 10 minutes or more. But four pilots who rose in light planes at Hamlet and at Greenwood were unable to catch up with it.

Witnesses who saw the strange object included business and professional men, housewives, a city policeman, trained air pilots and a mayor.

One of the pilots, Philip A. Gribble of Greenwood, S. C., however, Mrs Alice Poteat, said that when it moved into the glare of the setting sun and approached the Seven Dolars he was unable to make out any of its features.

DISCOUNT REPORTS
Some observers discounted reports that it could have been reflection from the sun. They said for that deuce has been any rain for the sun.

And active aeronautic it could not have been a weather observation balloon. But the Charlotte weather station, noting that most reports said the object appeared to be silver colored, said that the weather bureau does not use balloons of that color.

Mystery Object Seen Streaking Through Two Carolinas’ Skies; Columbian Is One of Observers

Hamlet, N. C., Dec. 29—(AP)—A strange line on a map, extending 200 miles across the Carolinas, to- day marked the mysterious travel of a strange flying object.
The object first was seen at Fayetteville, the site of an air force base, at about 4:30 p. m. (CST) yes- terday. Within a half-hour, scores of residents in Hamlet, Cheraw, Field, S. C, and Greenwood, S. C., reported sighting it on its eerie flight through the Western sky.
There was no explanation today of what the thing could have been. But observers attached significance to the fact that its path was straight for 200 miles. They noted also that after its 4:30 p. m. appearance at Fayetteville it was seen at Hamlet, 45 miles away, a few minutes later and at Greenwood, more than 150 miles away, shortly after 5 p. m.
William ("Billy") Shields, di- rector of the city tree depart- ment in Columbia, representing the object while hunting near Greenwood Wednesday at about 5:30 p. m. Mr. Shields re- ported the object looked like a "fluorescent light bulb." He said he watched it for at least 10 minutes while it hovered in one spot and then shot off through the sky at a terrific rate of speed.
"I thought I heard something this until I. I was that other people had seen the object also," Shields said. He said others were with him on the hunt and saw the object with him.
Descriptions of the flying object varied. At Fayetteville, it looked like a vertical neon light tube. At Hamlet it appeared to be a "Greenwood, a pilot who chased it in a light plane said it looked like a smoke trail coming from an unseen plane.
Ground observers at all four cities spoke of it "drifting in the direction of the setting sun. They said they were able to follow its southwest flight for ten min- utes or more. But for pilots who rose in light planes at Hamlet and Greenwood were unable to catch up with it.
Witnesses who saw the strange object included business and pro- fessional men, housewives, a city (object] turned up its end the mayor of Greenwood, A. H. Woodle.
One of the pilots, Philip Gibbons, a former air force pilot, said that when his plane approached the ob- ject, it moved into the glare of the evening sun. He was unable to re- gain sight of it.
Reports of the strange flight re- counted the numerous stories flying saucers since the war. Gibbons, the Hamlet pilot, said that the object definitely was not shaped like a saucer. The air force reported only this week that there are not nay "flying saucers” and that it has ended its special, two- year investigation of reports of them.

6. Mrs. Myrtis DICKENS, RD #5, Trumansburg, New York was interviewed and
stated that on 28 December 1949 she was at her home all day and did not see the
objects described by Mrs. [REDACTED] and her children, nor did she hear any airplanes
flying overhead that day. She further states that later that evening, Mrs. [REDACTED]
called her and asked whether or not she had seen the objects which were seen near
her home. She stated that she did not know of anyone in that vicinity who had seen
the objects except Mrs. [REDACTED] and her children.

7. Mrs. [REDACTED] Trumansburg, stated upon interview, that
on 28 December 1949 she was at home doing her housework and did not see the objects
described by Mrs. [REDACTED] although she had read about it in the newspaper. It had
been determined by Mrs. [REDACTED] that the object was the closest to the
spot in the road where they stopped to observe the objects in the sky. Mrs. [REDACTED]
stated that she did not see or hear anything unusual and did not know anything
about it until she read about it in the newspaper.

8. Mr. [REDACTED] whose farm borders the strip of woods over which Mrs.
[REDACTED] saw the objects flying, stated that on 28 December 1949 he was at home and
had been out on the farm with his tractor and had been out in the car also but that
he had not seen the objects described by Mrs. [REDACTED]. He stated that he was well
acquainted with Mrs. [REDACTED] and remembered her calling him on the phone the evening
after she had observed the flying objects, to inquire whether he had seen these
objects in the sky.

9. This Agent interviewed Mrs. [REDACTED] school teacher, Trumansburg,
New York and she stated that she was at home on 28 December 1949 as this was during
the Christmas vacation period. She stated that she had been going in and out of
the house a great deal that afternoon as she was helping her mother and father to
pack their trailer prior to their leaving for Florida. She stated that she did
not see any objects in the sky nor did she hear any airplanes. She stated further
that since the Christmas vacation she had talked to a great number of her students
and fellow teachers but no one had seen the objects described by Mrs. [REDACTED]. Most
of the students and teachers live in the vicinity of the location where Mrs. [REDACTED]
and her children saw the objects in the sky.

AT ITHACA, NEW YORK

10. This agent interviewed the Chief of Police, MARSHALL, and he stated that
he had seen the article in the Ithaca Journal relative to the [REDACTED] who live in
the Perry City section and who had seen the objects in the sky. A check of the
records revealed that there were no complaints received on 28 December 1949 nor had
any information other than that which was in the newspaper relative to the flying
objects, been heard of in that locality.

11. Professor Richard Parmenter, Assistant Professor of Research at Cornell
University, was interviewed by the Writer and he stated that he had seen the article
in the Ithaca newspaper and was quite interested, having read considerable publicity
about various people in the different parts of the country who had observed flying
saucers. He further stated that there were no experiments being conducted at the
University at this date and that there was no weather apparatus sent up to register
the weather that day. He added that to the best of his knowledge, 28 December 1949
was a warm, clear December day with no snow and excellent visibility.

He further states that it is possible that Mrs. _________ may have seen one of the Robinson Airliners, which is a DC-3, which landed at the Ithaca Airport at 1535, coming in from a Buffalo to Rochester to Ithaca, New York flight. He stated further that this would place the aircraft in the vicinity described by Mrs. ___________ approximately 1530, the time she states she saw the object. Another DC-3 landed at the Ithaca Airport at approximately 1522 from a Syracuse to Ithaca, New York flight. He stated further that upon checking the maps in the Operations Room at the Robinson Airliners, he determined that both flights, the one from Buffalo and the one from Syracuse, New York, would circle for a landing near the vicinity where Mrs. ___________ observed the objects on 26 December 1949.

`SUMMARY OF INFORMATION`

`Confirming telephoned report on this date, information is furnished that according to an Associated Press dispatch from Hamlet, N.C. dated 28 December 1949 which was published in the Charlotte Observer on 29 December 1949, a strange unidentified aircraft, resembling a balloon or blimp, was reported flying erratically over Hamlet, at approximately 1645 on 28 December 1949, apparently "out of control". According to the above dispatch several residents, including two pilots, gave various reports of the craft as "heading straight down" and "levelling off" and "turning over". One observer stated that he thought he saw something resembling a man drop from the craft and one pilot, who chased it in an airplane, said it appeared to be from 20 to 30 feet in diameter. (F-3)`

`It was first reported flying West over town at about 1645 by Dr. _, the local drapper, N.C. and overseas news correspondent, They reported the ship off the Hamlet airport where an overseas news correspondent, Air Force pilots, took to in a light plane to chase the craft. It definitely was not saucer shaped. The craft only once from the air and that it a former Air Force pilot, said he saw the craft was without any external fittings such as are ordinarily carried by free balloons. All these observers said the craft did not seem to have much speed from the ground, but the newsman reported it quickly disappeared in the sun when he drew near. The newsman said he last saw it about 12 miles Southwest of here." (F-3)`

`The weather station at Charlotte said there was some possibility that the object was a radiosonde balloon such as are released by weather stations at Greensboro and Fort Bragg, N.C. each morning about 1000. The balloons are used to transmit weather data from the atmosphere, and ordinarily burst at high altitude, the radio parachuting back to earth. However, the weather station said that the fact that it was seen over Hamlet, N.C. so late in the afternoon tended to discount this theory. _ said that he had chance from his Air Force service he was familiar with these balloons and that the strange craft did not resemble one. It was much bigger, he stated. He added that the fact that it did not change altitude for a long period of time also tended to disprove it was a balloon." (F-3)`

`According to another article in the above newspaper on 29 December 1949 several residents of Pageland, S.C. reported seeing a strange object in the sky moving westward on the afternoon of 28 December 1949. "The object, according to the reports, was not moving at a very fast rate, but persons who attempted to follow it in an automobile soon lost it in the evening sun, they reported.” (F-3)`

Charlotte Observer - 31 December 1949.

Cigar-Shaped ‘Thing’ Over City Identified As B-36 Vapor Trail

A ghostly silver tube suspended in cloudless skies brought new visions of air-borne cigars to mystified Charlottians yesterday.

But the strange, oblong object that has been reported streaking over the Carolina since Wednesday had been shorn of its mystery last night.

The control tower at Municipal airport identified "the thing" conclusively as the vapor trail of an Air Force B-36 flying high and fast 40,000 feet over the city.

The tubular-like object, visible over Charlotte for 15 minutes in midafternoon yesterday, was nothing more than a mass of ice crystals formed when the plane's hot engines came into contact with frigid air nearly eight miles up, airport observers said.

Earlier this week, the Carolinas became the center of excited talk all over the country when the mysterious object, described as resembling a neon tube standing on end, was reported seen in Hamlet, Fayetteville, and Greenwood, S.C.

The tubular white mass that appeared over Charlotte at 3:45 p.m. yesterday fitted the same description. There was some speculation that this explanation might also "lay away the mystery from the flying cigars" that were popping up north as New York.

While Charlottians excitedly telephoned the newspapers and the airport for explanations, a silvery streak appeared to hang suspended for a few minutes before drifting slowly out of sight.

Strange Craft
Is Reported
Seen in NC

Hamlet, N. C., Dec. 28—(AP)—A strange unidentified aircraft, resembling a balloon or a blimp, was reported flying “erratically over Hamlet today, apparently out of control.

Several residents, including two pilots, gave various reports of the craft, as “heading straight down and leveling off,” and “turning over.” One observer said he thought he saw something resembling a man drop from the craft and one pilot, who chased it in a plane, said it appeared to be from 20 to 30 feet in diameter.

It was first reported flying west over town at about 4:45 p. m. by Dr. W. D. James of Hamlet and Fire Chief J. W. Worley. They reported the object to the local airport where observers mess cook respondent Philip Gibbs has, took off in a light plane to give chase.

Pilot Gibbs, an ex-Navy flier, said he saw the craft only once from the air and that it definitely was not “a standard ship.”

He said he was unable to overtake it but that from a distance it appeared to be a large metal ball, without any external fittings such as are ordinarily carried by free balloons. Although observers said the craft did not seem to have much speed from the ground, Gibbs reported it quickly disappeared in the sun when he drew near.

The newsman said he last saw it about 32 miles southwest of here.

The weather station at Charlotte said there was some possibility that the object might have been a radio sonde balloon such as are released by weather stations. The balloons are used to transmit weather data from the atmosphere, and ordinarily burst at high altitude, the radio parachuting back to earth. However, the weather station said the time that it was seen over Hamlet—in late afternoon—tended to discount this theory.

Gibbs said that from his air force service he was familiar with these balloons and that the “strange craft did not resemble one. “it was much bigger,” he said, “it was much bigger.”

Odd Object Puzzles Hamlet

Hamlet, Dec. 28.—(AP)—A strange unidentified aircraft, resembling a balloon or a blimp, was reported flying "erratically" over Hamlet the day, apparently out of control.

Several residents, including two pilots, gave various reports of the craft as "heading straight down and leveling off," and "turning over."

One observer said he thought he saw something resembling a man drop from the craft and one pilot, who chased it in an airplane, said it appeared to be from 20 to 30 feet in diameter.

Gibbons, a former Air Force pilot, said he saw the craft only once from the air and that its definitely was not "saucer shaped."

He said he was unable to overtake it but that from a distance it appeared to be a large metal ball with loudy external fittings such as are ordinarily carried by free balloons. Although observers said the craft did not seem to have much speed from the ground, Gibbons reported it quickly disappeared in the south when he drew near.

The newsman said he last saw the 'blimp' 12 miles southwest of here. The weather station at Charlotte said there was some possibility that the object might have been a radio sonde balloon such as are released

However, the weather station said the fact that it was seen over Hamlet so late in the afternoon, tended to discount this theory.

And Gibbons said that from his air force service he was familiar with these balloons and that the strange craft did not resemble one. "It was much bigger," he said.

He added that the fact it did not change altitude for a long period of time also tended to disparage it was.
