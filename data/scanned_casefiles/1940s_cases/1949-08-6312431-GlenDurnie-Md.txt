DETAILS                                                 UNCLASSIFIED

This investigation was predicated upon information received during the investigation of 4th District Case lo. 35-144, "UNK?N?N SUBJECT." Case No. 35-144 was predicated upon a letter from Headquarters, OSI, file No. 35-Q, dated 19 May 1949, inclosing a letter from Mr. -------- of -----------, Baltimore 18, Maryland. Mr. -------- expressed a desire to give certain information to a high-ranking official of the Air Force. On 7 June 1949, T?Sgt. -------- advised Special Agent ADELS.KC of von HAucER that in approximately 1934 he purchased one-hundred (100) shares of stock from a Mr. JOHATHAI F. CALDWELL, who alleged to be a representative of the Gray Goose Corporation. Specifications of the aircraft to be built by the Gray Goose Corporation strongly resembled objects reported as flying disks in the newspapers in recent months, and Mr. -------- felt it his duty to report the incident to the proper authorities. All attempts to obtain documentive evidence from Mr. ---------- have proved futile. A trip to Baltimore, Maryland, to Salisbury, Maryland, was involved, and Mr. --------- continually fails to keep appointments for the trip to Salisbury.

Mr. -------- contacted the Baltimore Field Office of the FBI at approximately the same time this matter was reported to Headquarters, USAF. The Baltimore Field Office is not conducting an investigation and has authorized the detachment commander, Baltimore Detachment, 4th District, OSI, to proceed as he sees fit in this investigation. A check of the ED files of the Baltimore Field Office revealed that one JOHATHAI F. CALDWELL, of the said no more type in these files. Large numbers of citizens in Glen Burnie and Anne Arundel County are known to have purchased sizeable quantities of the stock. No record of __________'s activities is available in the FBI Field Office.

On 17 August 1949, Mr. HERBERT C. ESPEY, Postmaster, and Mr. George ROGERS, Assistant Postmaster, Glen Burnie, Maryland, were interviewed in their office. They revealed that the last known address of CALDWELL was c/o General Delivery, Washington, D. C., and in approximately 1940 he moved from that address and left no forwarding address. It was further revealed that CALDWELL rented P.O. Box 998, Glen Burnie, Maryland, in the name of "RotoPlane Company." Mail forwarded to the Washington address has been returned stamped "Moved left no forwarding address."

On 17 August 1943, Special Agent von HAUCKER contacted Trooper JIM J. FARABAUGH, Tad?-105, Car 13, Maryland State Pol0ce, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, concerning any information which he might have in reference to JONATHAI F. CALDWELL and the building of the Gray Goose in the Glen Burnie area. Trooper FARABAUGH advised that CALDWELL had resided on the old Lupton Farm, now owned by Mr. LEWIS FURNIVAL, real estate dealer, in Glen Burnie,

Maryland. Trooper HARBAUGH described HUFFREY as a "shrewd operator,"
and advised that the contact with this individual be withheld from
FURRFREY, and that all account nature of the Investigation be maintained on a
local plain. Trooper HARBAUGH explained that, due to the economic factor
involved in the Gray Goose Corporation, any interest shown by headquarters,
Air Force, in the matter might jeopardize the actual recovery of existing
models.

Mr. HUFFREY stated, in substance, that CALVINL lived on the old
Upton Farm in 1935, and used several outbuildings on the farm as work
shops for the building of some type of flying disks. CALVINL sold stock
to numerous people in the Glen Burnie area in his project. CALVINL de-
parted hurriedly during the night, leaving several pieces of aircraft equipment in the outhouses on the farm CALVINL owned FUFFREY about $6,000.00 rent. FUFREY sued for and obtained possession of furniture which CALVNLL
left. This furniture was sold to settle the debt. HUFFREY stated that he
was not interested in any of the "junk" which CALVINL left behind and that
Trooper HARBAUGH was welcome to it if he would remove it from his property.

Special Agent von HAUCHER, aocomoanied by Trooper FARBAUGH, located
two models in a tobacco shed on the Upton Farm. Both of these models were
in bad state of repair, but it was obvious from examination that these ob-
jects had been used in some type of aeronautical experiment. Due to the
lateness of the hour and the circumstances surrounding the situation, no
effort was made to protect these items at this time.

On 18 August 1949, Trooper HARBAUGH was contacted and arrangements
were made to photograph and sketch both aerial models on the Upton Farm.
The old Upton Farm is located 200 yards north of the old Annapolis Road,
near Layte Park, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Mr. ------,
lives on the farm. Mr. ------, was interviewed concerning the plane
models in the tobacco shed, and stated, in substance, that the objects had
been there during the five years that he had lived on the farm that they
were no concern of his and he had paid no attention to them. He knew noth-
ing about the models that would contribute to this investigation.

Two models were found in the tobacco shed on the Upton Farm. One
model, an auto-giro type plane, had been manufactured by the Gray Gooe
Company. CALVINL sold stock in this model, completed the experimental
model and is reported to have flown the model for from five to ten minutes
and reached an altitude of approximately 50 ft. The other model was built
by the Rotor-plane Company and did not reach the flying stage in its development before CALVINL mysteriously vanished. It is believed that the Gray
Gooe was concerned under CAA Experimental lic. ####. The following is a
physical description of the Gray Goose:

UNCLASSIFIED
CALDWELL, et al - 24-95

The Gray Goose had an overall length of approximately 14 ft., with a rather conventional-type fuselage. A 9-cylinder, 45-horsepower French engine (Somer(?)) was mounted on a conventional front fuselage engine mount, driving a conventional two-blade wooden propeller. The model had no wings, but possibly had stabilizing airfoils located in the general wing position. The fuselage was a single cockpit, tricycle land-ing gear affair, with a high square vertical stabilizer and broad rudder. A spring steel tail skid was mounted to the rear bottom of the fuselage, and some type of horizontal sta-bilizers were attached to the fuselage near the conventional position. These horizontal stabilizers appeared to be mounted away from the fuselage on an "A"-type frame, and one informant stated that the inventor had "some type of orary ring as far as ailerons were concerned." The cockpit contained an alti-meter, a tachometer, an oil pressure gauge, a fuel pressure gauge and three blank instrument spaces. The plane was con-trolled by means of a stick and rudder pedals. The fuselage construction consisted of three-quarter inch welded steel tub-ing, covered with a tarpaper-type material on top and above the fuselage was a disc, approximately 14 ft. in diameter. This disc resembled two dinner plates face to face, with a winder of reinforced plywood, covered with aluminum on the edges and covered with aircraft fabric. A center revolving axle was controlled by an expander-type brake. Four airfoil blades, approximately 3 ft. in length and 12" in width were attached to the cardinal points of the disc. Present con-dition indicates that these blades could be controlled, there-fore making it possible to change the pitch. The blades were of reinforced-type construction with a cord of 3" on the leading edge and 3 1/2" on the trailing edge. The leading edge was stripped with copper and the blade was constructed of polished hardwood. From present appearances, the disk was free rotating and was given its momentum by prop blast and forward thrust. The engine had been removed from the fuselage and was no longer on the premises.

The rotor-plane was in a bad condition and was not immediately identi-fied as being a second model. Very little of this model is now available for study. The model, as it exists today, consists of a plywood and steel reinforced cylinder, approximately 14 ft. in diameter and 3 ft. in depth. Six airfoil blades of the same type as were used on the Gray Goose were also found. These blades are approximately 8 ft. in length. Two bands, 10" in width with a roller door attached, were also found.

On 18 August 1949, Mr.  --------- and Mrs. --------- Glen Burnie, Maryland, were interviewed concerning CALDWELL. The Glen Burnie Airport

CALDXELL, et al - 24-98 UNCLASSIFIED

is located about two miles from the old Upton Farm, where CALDWELL developed the aircraft models. [redacted] stated that he had been approached by [redacted] sometime about 1939 concerning hanger space and the use of his shops in the development of the models. [redacted] stated that he was interested in the idea until 17. CALDWELL stated that he desired to pay for the services with stock in the company. [redacted] stated that he took one look at the model that CALDWELL was building on the Upton Farm, and told him that he did not want to have anything to do with it. [redacted] stated that he knew nothing else about the matter, but he believed that one of his mechanics, a Mr. John H [redacted], had worked for CALDWELL during the building of the model on the Upton Farm.

On 18 August 1949, Mr. [redacted], a mechanic employed by The Standard Air Service Corporation, was interviewed at the Glen Burnie Air port, and stated in substance that he had worked with Mr. CALDWELL for several months on the rotorplane and the Gray Goose. [redacted] stated that he was told by CALDWELL that the Grey Goose flew in the Washington, D.C. area for about 15 minutes and reached a height of about 50 feet.
Mr. GAZZIL said that most of his work had been done on the rotorplane, which he attempted to test by because "everyone else was afraid to". The rotor-plane was powered by a 1938 (?) Chrysler aitcraft engina and failed lift itsolf off of the ground during thes tests. [redacted] stated that the aircraft was small and he expected the thing to fly apart at any time. CALDWELL had a small model of the rotroplane powered by a 1/4 h.p. electric motor that would lift 14 pounds several feet off of a table. [redacted] described the model as a beautiful job of construction. [redacted] stated that CALDWELL left in a hurry during the night, leaving the models behind, but the small working model of the rotorplane has not been seen since CALDWELL disappeared.

[redacted] and Mrs. [redacted] were cautioned by Special Agents BELK and von HAUCH, as well as Trooper HARDRAUGH, who was present during the interview, that the investigation was of a classified nature and they were not to talk about the investigation to anyone.

Mr. [redacted], residing on the Upton Farm, was interviewed on 19 August 1949 and stated that an aircraft engine had been attached to the Gray Goose until about a year ago. At that time two white men, about twenty years of age, came to the Upton Farm in a 1933 Chevrolet and removed the engine, fuel and oil tanks and all of the fuel lines and wiring from the Gray Goose. He knew nothing else that would contribute to this investigation.

On 18 August 1949, Mr. [redacted], caretaker on the Upton Farm, was interviewed for the second time, and stated that he had no knowledge of the removal of the engine, but two young men had come to his house about a year ago and said that they were interested in removing the fuselage of the Gray Goose. After examining it, they decided that it

was not worth taking away, and left empty-handed. ------ remembered that
the engine was missing at this time, but stated that he knew nothing about
it.

AGENT'S NOTES: ------- was very reluctant 
to talk to this Agent. He continually made the statement, "I don't know 
nothing, I always mind my own business, and this thing is no business of 
mine, or my ideas."

On 18 August 1949, Mr. ------- was confronted with the al-
leged information that the engine to the Gray Goose had been repaired in
the shop of his Glen Burnie Airport within the past year by Trooper HARDUIGH.
Although ------- had denied in a previous interview any knowledge of the
engine, he suddenly remembered that an IRA LOUIS S. CRISWELL, a student of
------, had approached him to buy a Mercury engine. Mr. ------- stated
that CRISWELL was employed by the Glen Burnie Post Office.

AGENT'S NOTES: During this entire investigation, Mr. --------

On 18 August 1949, Mr. --------, Carrier, was interviewed
at the Glen Burnie Post Office, and stated that he had removed the engine,
fuel tanks and wiring from the Gray Goose about a year ago, with the per-
mission of ------- and now had the engine in his basement. The engine
was completely disassembled. Trooper HARDUIGH instructed ------- to re-
assemble the engine and bring it to his house as soon as possible.

On 18 August 1949, Mr. -------, 924 Wilmont Court, Baltimore
2, Maryland, was contacted concerning an artist's conception of flying
discs reported seen by him on 29 June 1949. The 4th District, OSI, con-
ducted an investigation of this incident and rendered a Finding, report,
dated 18 July 1949, under Case #24-786. Special Agent BULK described the
Glenn Lourcle models to ------- and he made a drawing of both models from this
description. A photograph of this drawing is enclosed as an exhibit.

On 19 August 1949, a detail of Five (5) men and driver, accompanied
by Special Agent VON MACHLER, proceeded from Camp Holabird, Baltimore,
Maryland, to Aviatron Crossing, Maryland, and an Army truck, 1-1/2 ton,
2 x 4, loaned to the Baltimore Detachment, 4th OSI District by the Camp
Holabird Motor Pool. The truck departed from Camp Holabird at approxi-
mately 1250 and arrived at the home of State Trooper JESSE J. HARDUIGH,
Maryland State Police, near Glenn burnie, Maryland, at 1350 hours.
Details, accompanied by Trooper HARDUIGH, went to the tobacco shed on the 
property Farm and loaded and removed the "Gray Goose" to a place in the rear
of the garage at the home of Trooper HARDUIGH. HARDUIGH had received per-
mission to remove the objects from the property by the tenant, owner.

The detail consisted of the following EM; Sgt. [redacted] [redacted], Sgt. [redacted] [redacted], [redacted]
[redacted], Pfc. [redacted] [redacted], and Pfc. [redacted]
[redacted]. The driver was Pvt. [redacted] [redacted].

After the truck was unloaded a reporter from the Baltimore Eveni[ng]
Sun approached Special Agent [redacted] and attempted to obtain a state-
ment concerning the objects. Von [redacted] explained to the reporter, who
identified himself as one [redacted] that he had no statement
to make and referred the reporter to Captain B[redacted], at the 4th OSI District
Office. Trooper HARBAUGH made a similar statement.

On 19 August 1949, Special Agent von [redacted] interviewed one [redacted]
and [redacted] [redacted] residents of [redacted] who live on the [redacted] 
Farm, and these individuals stated in substance that they had known [redacted]
reported in the tobacco field on the [redacted] on which they play living for the
past number of years. The [redacted] were living in the area in 1940 when
[redacted], was at the [redacted] Farm. [redacted] was driving a 1931 Chrysler,
with District of Columbia license. The [redacted] stated that [redacted] re-
mained on the [redacted] Farm for about eight (8) months, and then left very
suddenly. [redacted], son was in his early twenty's, tall, brown curly
hair, dressed well, and was called "Junior" by his parents. A mechanic
who is believed to have worked with [redacted] during the entire project
was known as [redacted].

On 19 August 1949, Maryland State Trooper JOHN J. HARBAUGH stated
that he had received information that a mechanic called
ported to have worked with [redacted], may be one [redacted] now believed
to be residing in Herald Harbor, Silver Spring, Maryland.

On 19 August 1949, at 0930, a telephone report of this entire in-
vestigation was made by Major JCSHEH J. DERADO, executive officer, 4th OSI
District, to Colonel CARPSHEIR, Deputy Director, Headquarters, OSI.

The photograph in the document depicts two individuals inspecting an object, which appears to be the mysterious aircraft mentioned in the article. The image is rather grainy, but one can make out the rough shape of the object they're examining, along with some other unidentifiable pieces of equipment or debris scattered around it. The two individuals are focused on the object, with one squatting down beside it and the other leaning over it.

Here's the text from the document:

```plaintext
Not a Ghost Rider of the Sky

State police inspect a mysterious aircraft found in an abandoned tobacco shed at Marley Park, Md. At first, an Air Force spokesman said the big gadget, made of tubular steel and fabric and named the Gray Goose, was “a definite prototype” of the flying saucer. Later, however, the Air Force announced that the Maryland craft had no connection with the saucer.

Rusting Skeletons
No Flying Saucers

Air Force Rejects
Find in Maryland

By United Press.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 20.—After hushing it over for a day, the Air Force decided today the two strange old crafts found in a Maryland barn have absolutely no connection with the purported phenomena of flying saucers.

Several official spokesmen for the Air Force had hemmed and hawed about the discovery since the experimental craft were found. One had said they were definite prototypes (ancestors) of the flying saucer. Another later toned that down considerably.

The Air Force after noon today rather shortly released this bare statement:

"The Air Force states that the two experimental craft, found near Elkridge, Md., yesterday bear absolutely no connection with the reported phenomenon of flying saucers."

Thus the Air Force again stated its skeptical attitude as to whether there really ever had been any such things.

The eccentric inventor of the rotting, rusting abandoned experimental aircraft discovered yesterday was Jonathan E. Caldwell. He disappeared from Maryland nine years ago. No one has been able to discover where he went.

The provided image contains two black-and-white photographs:

1. The top photograph appears to be an underexposed scene featuring an open space under a structure, possibly a shed or a deck. The area seems partially cluttered and there is an object that resembles a small boat or a canoe resting on what looks like a wooden support or railing. The background is dark, making it difficult to discern additional details.

2. The bottom photograph is also quite dark and shows a patterned circular area on the ground that might suggest a symbol or a marking. This marking appears to be segmented with alternating dark and light sections, and it is located underneath a structure with visible support poles.

Unfortunately, due to the poor quality and darkness of the photographs, specific details are challenging to make out. There is no text in the images; therefore, there's no additional information to provide from this photo.

The image in the document appears to be a black and white photo depicting an object with a disk-like shape. There is a clear frame around the photograph, and the image seems quite grainy and lacks detail, making it difficult to describe with accuracy. To the right of the image, there seems to be a structure that could be interpreted as part of a fuselage and cockpit, as mentioned in the caption provided in the document. The surroundings are indistinct but suggest a flat surface that might be the ground.

CALDWELL, et al - 24-95

UNCLASSIFIED

DETAILS

On 20 August 1949, Mr. ****** ****** contacted Special Agent von *****ER and offered to make the trip to Salisbury, Maryland, on 22 August 1949, and make available all information in his possession concerning Gray Goose Airways. Mr. ****** was the original informant in this case, but he refused to cooperate with agents of the Baltimore Detachment, 4th OSI District, until newspaper publicity was given the story.

On 22 August 1949, Mr. ****** ******* was accompanied to Salisbury, Maryland, by Special Agent MARCEL D'FUOGE. Mr. **** turned over about twenty-five (25) items of data, including newspaper accounts, stock certificates, photographs, personal correspondence between **** and his father, and program brochures. Photostatic copies of items of data pertinent to this investigation will be forwarded at a later date.

Mr. ***** stated in substance that he felt quite certain that Mr. ***, had no intention of defrauding any of the individuals concerned in the Gray Goose Corporation, and expressed the thought that Mr. **** actually "had something" in his ideas and just the bad luck and lack of funds had caused the failure of his project. Mr. **** expressed complete confidence in ****'s ability and expressed the hope that some day **** would perfect one of his experimental-type airplanes and be able to fly off all of his contracted debts.

Information developed previously in this investigation indicated that fabrication of the rotor-plane took place in a carpenter shop somewhere on Barre Street, Baltimore, Maryland. On 22 August 1949, Special Agent OTTO D. SUNDSTAD interviewed MR. ******** ************, 510 W. Barre Street. Mr. ********* revealed that a carpenter by the name of WALTER DOWLING had resided at 506 Barre Street. Mr. ********* stated that DOWLING had an office in the basement of his home and a work-shop in the garage at the rear of the building. Mr. ********* believes that DOWLING is dead, and further stated that DOWLING moved from 510 W. Barre Street about ten years ago to a location at Edmonston Avenue and Rolling Road, Baltimore, Maryland. DOWLING had a son who assisted him in his work, and
it is believed that the son now resides in Edmonston Village, Baltimore, Maryland.

On 22 August 1949, Sgt. HENRY T. COCHRANE and Pvt. ANTHONY DUMMER, Baltimore Police Department, Southern District, were interviewed by Special Agent SUNDSTAD in reference to a carpenter shop located on S. Barre Street. Both officers stated that they had been working in the area a number of years and had never heard of a carpenter shop in that area.

UNCLASSIFIED 

On 22 August 1949, Mr. H. CLEVELAND LOGUE, 301 American Building, 
East Baltimore Street, Baltimore, Maryland, was interviewed by Special 
Agent SUNDSTAD in his office, and stated that he purchased fifty (50) 
shares of stock in the Gray Goose Airways, Inc. on 6 March 1936 from 
Mr. JONATHAN E. CALDWELL for the sum of $5.00. Mr. LOGUE stated that 
he purchased the stock directly from CALDWELL and that CALDWELL im- 
pressed him as having a genuine interest in his invention. In his op- 
inion CALDWELL was definitely not a "con" man.

On 22 August, Special Agent EDWARD S. LEONARD interviewed Mr. 
EDWARD F. DODD, Chief of the Aircraft Record Branch, Civil Aeronautics 
Authority, Washington, D. C. Mr. DODD made available to this agent three 
files of the CAA dealing with the Gray Goose Airways, Inc. A check of 
the first file revealed that on 12 January 1936 the Gray Goose Airways, 
Inc., 1103 Vermont Ave., Room 305, Washington, D. C., filed claim for 
license for a glider-type aircraft, powered by a Harley Davidson motor- 
cycle engine no propeller was utilized on this glider. The idea was to 
use the engine merely as a motivating device on the ground. CAA granted 
License No. 4308 to JONATHAN E. CALDWELL, President, Gray Goose Airways, 
Inc. for experimental purposes on this model. The file further revealed 
that MR JERRY J. KOFCZYK, 49 Collins Ave., Spring Valley, New York, 
purchased 150 shares of stock, at 10¢ per share, on 29 December 1932. 
The device was housed in a barn on Bell-Ans property at Orangeburg, New 
York. Photos News took pictures of the flight in 1933. Mr. KOFCZYK 
stated in a letter to the CAA that he believed CALDWELL was residing in 
Pearl River, New York, in 1934-1935.

CAA License No. 355V was granted to the Gray Goose, Inc., 3201 S. 
Columbine Street, P.O. Box 192, Denver, Colorado, for the construction 
of a single-place monoplane, powered by water cooled, 60 hp, Ford 
Model A engine. This plane was built in 1930. Mr. WILLIAM S. TUTTLE, 
former auditor for the Denver-Rio Grande Railroad, was listed as presi- 
dent of Gray Goose, Inc., JONATHAN E. CALDWELL, Secretary, and OLIVE 
CALDWELL, Vice-President.

License No. 99V was issued to Gray Goose Airways, Inc., 1225 New 
York Ave., Washington, D. C., for the manufacture of a disk rotor-plane, 
powered by a Model 9-AD, Specification No. 105040, 40 horsepower engine, 
manufactured by the Societe de Moteurs, System Canton-Unne, Billancourt, 
France. Propeller blades for the aircraft were fixed-wood type ALK-25, 
manufactured by the Aero-LATIN Klemm Company. A letter in this file 
indicated that a SARA McGILL, 925 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania, had purchased 428 shares of stock in the airplane at 10¢ 
per share. This rifle also contained a letter dated 3 September 1947 
from Mr. E. G. VANDERLIP, Patent Engineer, Fiesocki Helicopter Company, 
requesting information from the CAA as to who now had control and had 
invented the disk rotor-helicopter.

CALDWELL, ot al - 24-93

Mr. A. A. Vollmecke, Chief of Air UNCLASSIFIED Branch, Civil Aeronautics Authority, suggested that this office contact a Professor CROOKS, Catholic University, Washington, D. C., who is an aero-dynamic engineer and is very interested in peculiar type aircraft. He is also suggested that this office contact a Mr. DRIGGERS, Hanger No. 5, Washington National Airport, CAA Maintenance Group. Mr. VOLLMERKE believes that Mr. DRIGGERS, a mechanical engineer, worked with CALDWELL during the experimental stages of the No. 99Y.

On 22 August 1949, the files of the Office of the Attorney General, State of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, were examined by Special Agent A. VON HAUCHER. The following is a list of items contained in this file:

Stenographic Record in the Matter: Rotor-Planes, Inc. and Gray Goose Airways, Inc., before the Attorney General of Maryland, Thursday, February 8, 1940 (this stenographic record contains 120 pages of testimony);

CALDWELL, et al - 24-93

UNCLASSIFIED

On 22 August 1949, Special Agent V.A. VAUCED interviewed 
Mr. ROBERT E. CLAPP, JR., Attorney, in his office, 117 Court Street,
Frederick, Maryland, with reference to CALDWELL. Mr. CLAPP stated
that during his tenure of office as Assistant Attorney General, opns 
CALDWELL & CALDWELL, Glen Surlno, Maryland, was subpoenaed to appear
in CLAPP's office in connection with activities of Gray Goose Airways,
Inc. and Rotor-Planes, Inc., to determine whether fraudulent stock 
sales of these corporations were being made in violation of the Blue
Sky Laws (Art. 32A of the Annotated Code of Maryland). The result of
this hearing was the issuance of a restraining against both corporations
and CALDWELL, forbidding, sale of stock in Maryland. Personally, CLAPP
stated that CALDWELL impressed him as "a sincere individual who had 
knowledge of corporate finance, and no particular knowledge of corporation law." "I felt then that CALDWELL was sincere in his conviction
that he had something to offer the aviation industry, and he was not
in any way a 'confidence man' or a 'slick operator,' but rather a 'babe-
in the woods' type, whose only interest, was in the development and pro-
duction of his aircraft," CLAPP continued, "and could see nothing wrong
in just selling more stock when he needed more money. I don't believe
that there was any criminal intent or intent to defraud, but his methods
of operation were irregular." CLAPP was shown a picture of CALDWELL,
and asked if he could identify him. In reply, he stated that "If I had 
read nothing in the newspapers I could only say that I had seen him
somewhere before, but in view of what has happened I can state that it
resembles the individual I saw as CALDWELL in 1940".

On 22 August 1949, Special Agents C. E. BELK and EDWARD S. LEONARD
interviewed Mr. WILLIAM E. DRIGGERS, 1530 Olive Street, n.e., Washington,
D. C. MR. DRIGGERS is presently employed by the CAA Maintenance group,
hanger 5, Washington National Airport. MR. DRIGGERS stated that his
First contact with CALDWELL was brought about by a recommendation from
Fairchild Aircraft Corporation, Hagerstown, Maryland. CALDWELL had re-
quested information from Fairchild concerning a mechanical engineer in
the Washington area that could give him assistance in the development
of an airplane. In 1937, DRIGGERS began working for CALDWELL on a
gyro-gyro. CALDWELL built two incomplete models of this airplane and
gave it a great deal of publicity. Stock to finance this aircraft was
sold in the name of the Gray Goose Airways. DRIGGERS stated that
CALDWELL told him that he had sold over a quarter of a million dollars
of the stock in this company. CALDWELL had previously carried on his
experiments in New York and New Jersey, but had been forced to move to
Maryland due to an enjoinder issued by the Attorney General's of those
states. CALDWELL suddenly lost interest in the cyclo-gyro and stopped
all construction on this plane. The cyclo-gyro was being constructed
in a barn near Brown's Corner, Takoma Park, Maryland. CALDWELL opened
a shop at 923 Kenilworth Avenue, for the construction of the Gray

WASHINGTON POST, 20 AUGUST 1949

First 'Saucer' Is Located By Air Force
The battered remnants of what may have been the original "flying saucer" and possibly the first successful helicopter were uncovered in a Maryland tobacco shed yesterday.

Attached to their discovery by state police is the story of a 60-year-old inventor who was en- 
Gined from selling work for the 
Jersey Cose Airways and disappeared some 10 years ago.

Air Force investigators were astated by Maryland police in locating the rickety craft on the Lewis Pump hokey farm about 11 miles south of Baltimore near Glen Burnie.

The Associated Press quoted the Air Force last night as saying there is "a good chance" that the craft "are prototypes" of mysterious "flying saucers" that pilots have reported seeing from time to time.

The Air Force said Bolling Field had been advised that "some flying lenses have been located in Maryland," and that Army detachments made an investation.

The first plane was described as looking like a helicopter. It had a device on the resembling two huge saucers, 16 feet in diameter, covered with airplane cloth. It had 1450 holes in its lower surface, no engine was found, and no license had been required by the nine-cylinder radial engine.

The other craft resembled the Mars Volta in its outer shell of plywood and with an engine and cockpit inside.

It had the four blades extending around its top rotor in the position. They rotated around the bottom, according to the Air Air directions

John W. Gann of the GlenBurnie Airport, wasn't surprised to hear the two machines had been found. He felt he helped inventor Jonathan E. Caldwell built them, he said.

Gann said he couldn't enlighten Air Force investigators on the whereabouts of Caldwell. He said he understood the securities and exchange camession was interested in Caldwell's stock sales about 1930. Gann said he last saw Caldwell about 1939, when the inventor disappeared.

The 1939 or 1937, Caldwell staked.

Goose Floaticopter immediately. When this plane was nearing flight tests, it was discovered that Patent No. 2103839, owned by Mr. EDWARD B. TILFORD, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, covered the circular disk type helicopter. CALDWELL made a trip to Philadelphia and took the matter up with WILFORD. WILFORD granted permission for CALDWELL to continue building the plane. CALDWELL owns U. S. Patent Nos.
1,640,645 and 1,747,535, dealing with construction of this airplane.
Mr. DRIGGERS stated that CALDWELL had no engineering or mechanical ability, but possessed an inventive genius for thinking up new ideas, and it was only after a great deal of persuasion on the part of
DRIGGERS that CALDWELL engaged the help of Professor LEWIS CROOKS, Engineering Department of Aeronautics, Catholic University, Washington, D.C.
Dr. CROOKS tested the circular airfoil for the Gray Goose Corporation and reported that the airfoil possessed an exceptionally large lift coefficient. Mr. DRIGGERS further stated that he was the pilot that tested this airplane on 8 March 1939 on the old Benning Race Track.
The test resulted in damage to one of the landing gears after a flight of about one minute, during which time the plane rose to a height of approximately forty (40) ft. above the ground. The test report of DRIGGERS is attached as an exhibit hereto. DRIGGERS further stated that immediately after the first test, CALDWELL's interest in the disk rotor cooled considerably. He allowed the rent to lapse on the warehouse where the plane was being built and failed to pay him (DRIGGERS) for contracted wages. On 12 May 1939, U. S. Marshal JOHN D. COTTS has sold the entire contents of CALDWELL's shop at public auction.
Mr. H. C. WALKER, owner of the warehouse, purchased the equipment, which included the disk rotor model. Mr. DRIGGERS further stated that CALDWELL owed WALKER approximately $1,000.00 back rent. Several months later, CALDWELL purchased the plane model and all of his tools from WALKER for $500.00. It was necessary for DRIGGERS to institute suit against CALDWELL in order to collect his wages. In the meantime, CALDWELL had moved to Glen Burnie, Maryland, and resumed his activities. About this time, the Gray Goose Company was declared bankrupt and stocks was re-issued in the name of Rotor-Plane, Inc. Mr. DRIGGERS made available to the agents of the 4th OSI District all data and written material which he possessed. Photostats of pertinent data will be forwarded with a later report.

On 23 August 1949, the records of the University of Maryland were checked by Special Agent EDWARD S. LEONARD, and revealed that CARL DAVIS CALDWELL attended the University of Maryland from 20 September 1937 to 28 January 1938. Reason for voluntary withdrawal was stated as ill health and financial trouble. The birth date of CARL CALDWELL was listed as 17 July 1917, Lewiston, Montana. CALDWELL previously attended Roosevelt High School, Washington, D.C., and graduated from that institution in January 1937. Address at time of matriculation from tho College of Engineering, University of Maryland, was

On 23 August 1949, copies of newspaper articles appearing in the 15 March 1940 issue of the "Baltimore Sun" and photostatic slicks of newspaper pictures were obtained from the City Editor, "Baltimore Evening Sun", Baltimore, Maryland, by Special Agent A. von TACCHERE. The following description of the CALDWELL helicopter was obtained from the files of the "Baltimore Sun":

"THE CALDWELL HELICOPTER"

"The Caldwell helicopter is the product of many years of research and experiment, to introduce a cheap safe and convenient general utility aircraft of rotating wing type, capable of taking off and landing in a small yard on the flat roof of a building.

"A laboratory model was first constructed and equipped with an electric motor. It lifts more than 52 lbs. vertically, per horse power. Using this as basis for formula, a Ford V8 motor should lift approximately two tons.

"Its great simplicity of structure and design, mechanical movements and controls, sets it entirely apart from either German or French machines already flying. Mass production should make it much cheaper to build than an automobile.

"Two sets of rotors revolve in opposite directions around the body of the ship. They are power driven in ascent and aerodynamically driven in descent. Natural forces alone will drive the rotors fast enough to lower the ship slower than a parachute. When natural forces can be relied upon for safe landing power, flying then will become the safest of all forms of transportation.

"Directional control is attained by changing the angle of the blades of one set of rotors with respect to the other set. Forward and reverse motion is accomplished with a tilting mechanism. Slippage takes place toward the lower side. By this method the advancing blades are riding down grade and the retreating blades are gaining altitude. Birds have always used this principle of flight. It is nature's swiftest and cheapest transportation method.

"The bottom of the helicopter is water tight. It is designed to take off and land on both land and water. The believe it will be as easy and safe to operate as an automobile and that anyone accustomed to driving a car should land it in a few hours.

"By using a V8 Ford Motor or its equivalent for a power plant, it
should have a speed around one hundred miles per hour and a four
or five passenger ship should sell for less than the lower priced
automobiles."

On 24 August 1949, Special Agent BEZL interviewed Dr. LOUIS
E. CROOKS, head of the Department of Aeronautics, Catholic University.
Professor CROOKS stated that a complete report of disk airfoils was
on file in a NACA article published in 1929 under the title "Low
Aspect Ratio Wing." An airplane very similar to CALDWELL's disk rotor
helicopter had been built in 1931 by a Mr. NEMETH, Chicago, Illinois.
This plane, powered by 125 horsepower engine, has made many successful
flights and is still flying. Professor CROOKS stated that CALDWELL's
idea was not new, that he was not an engineer in the true sense of
the word, and that he possessed no inventing knowledge. CROOKS also
further stated that he explained the above information to CALDWELL and
told him that he was working on an old idea. Professor CROOKS stated
that in exhaustive wind tunnel tests that have been conducted during
the past twenty years the lift ratio of the circular airfoil has al-
ways proved very high. However, aircraft models utilizing this type
of wing have not been able to overcome the problem of lateral control.

    Mr. JONATHAN E. CALDWELL is located at 1456 9th Street,
Manhattan Beach, California, and is believed to be actively engaged
in stock selling for aircraft building in the vicinity of Las Vegas,
Nevada. CALDWELL is not being contacted unless instructions are re-
ceived from Air Materiel Command to do so.

gentlemen were in his office this morning,

RE. GRAY GOOSE AIR WAYS, INC.

March 20, 1956: William Curry, Chief of Police, Annapolis,
Maryland, apprehended OLIVE E. CALDWELL, whose address
is given as 1101 Vermont Avenue, N.W., Washington, D. C.,
for selling shares of stock in the above corporation to
CHARLES ABRAMOS and GEORGE PAPFAS (Main Street, Annapolis,
Md.)

The following appears from memoranda of an interview
with JONATHAN E. CALDWELL and CARL H. DAVIS had in Room
631 (or 621-?) of the Securities and Exchange Commission on
April 13, 1956, by Mr. W. L. Iaianno, Attorney in Charge
Washington Field Section:-

Caldwell stated that he had been enjoined in the
State of New York - February, 1954, from sale of this stock;
and, previous to that action, in New Jersey during 1932 he
was called before the Attorney General and agreed to stop
selling the securities in the Gray Goose Airways, Inc. During
the years 1928 --- 1950 he was in Denver, Colorado, and was
a licensed dealer in that State.

Since leaving New York in 1952, he has been making
sales in Virginia, Maryland and West Virginia, - some sales
having been made in West Virginia during 1956. These securities

were not qualified in Virginia or West Virginia and, during the early part of 1936, while selling in Annapolis, Maryland, he was informed by the Chief of Police that he could make no further sales in that city without complying with the provisions of the City Ordinance.

Since 1933 he has sold to approximately 500 or 600 people, which sales netted the corporation between $3,000. and $4,000.

The majority of his sales were made by personal contact, and there was no mail campaign used in the distribution.

CARL H. DAVIS, salesman for the Corporation, began selling approximately six months ago and has sold to seven or eight friends who live in the District of Columbia. Mr. Davis lived in Los Angeles, Calif., from 1910 until 1935 and was in the publishing business in that city, connected wth [sic] the National Publishing Co., Ltd., a California corporation, of which he was Secretary and Treasurer. During 1928 and 1929 he was connected with the Interstate Publishing and Manufacturing Co. of Pasadena, Calif.

The stock is also being sold by JUDGE KENNAN, a retired lawyer, living at 1508 Rhode Island Ave., N.W., who has made six or seven sales.

Mr. Caldwell stated that, if any further information was desired by the Commission, it could be secured from his office.

UNCLASSIFIED

In another interview with Mr. J. E. CALDWELL had by
Mr. Malone on April 6, 1936, Caldwell stated that 51% of
the capital stock of the GRAY GOOSE AIRWAYS, INC. had been
voted to him in consideration of two mechanical patents,
for which patent applications were granted in 1928 and 1930.
Since that time he has been engaged in the sale of corporate
stock and has sold approximately 2,000,000 shares.

This stock is of the par value of 10¢ and the Corporation
is capitalized for 10,000,000 shares. The entire proceeds
of the sales go to the corporation and are used to pay
expenses in the development of an air-plane. Although
he has been working on this air-plane for the past six or
seven years, he has not met with much success and up the
present time has only succeeded in getting the rear wheel
a few inches off the ground.

Mr. Caldwell's wife, OLIVE E. CALDWELL, is President
and receives $1,000. per year. Mr. J. E. Caldwell is
Secretary and Treasurer, and receives $1,200. per year. He
says he makes the following representations to prospective
purchasers -

That the stock is based on an invention, which in-
vention is used in the development of an air-plane designed
to fly on the Byrd principle of flight, and that the stock
is worth nothing or from $10. to $1,000. per share, depending 
upon his success in developing the air-plane.

Caldwell's technical experience and schooling consists
of a high-school education and two years study in the School
of Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State College, Corvallis,
Oregon.

Real Flying Saucers Found
At Last--Inventor Missing

DADDY OF DISKS—This tattered contraption, found by Maryland state police Friday in a copse near Westminster, is all that's left of a 10-year-old flying experiment. The big disk was round and was designed to lift the flying saucers inventor likened to the hummingbird at two years of age. The inventor, Jonathan Caldwell, dropped out of sight eight years ago.

Air Force Official Says Improved Models
Are Now Being Sent Up Into Sky

BY THE BALTIMORE SUN
BALTIMORE, Aug. 19.—(AP)—The Baltimore Sun tonight quoted an air force officer as saying that two battered old aircraft found near here are—
"definitely the prototype of the flying saucer."
The Sun quoted the air force official as saying that he believed greatly improved models of the two planes found in an abandoned barn are flying now, and are the source of the flying saucer reports of the past years.
State police found the old machines, two largely a collection of junk, in the barn near Glen Burnie, about 11 miles south of Baltimore.
Their inventor, Jonathan E. Caldwell, dropped out of sight eight years ago.

NEW PLANES — 
The official declined the use of his name, the Sun said, but he claimed air force authorities had given him permission to make a statement confirming the Glen Burnie discovery.
The officer explained that air force uses the term "prototype" to denote the first model from which an airplane develops.

The Sun went on to quote him as saying:
"I personally think the inventor went to some other part of the country and developed newer more — that he has new saucers among us now."
Dr. Kinzel, a fiber mechanic who worked with Caldwell on the string of craft back in 1936 and '37—-riding Caldwell's 104 and 105 years ahead of his time in developing the planes.

STOCK TROUBLE—
Caldwell had a hard time with them back in 1939 and 1940. The crate with the disc inside them, buttonholed to make a dangerous crash landing.
Caldwell got into legal difficulties in Maryland, New Jersey and New York about the same time for selling stock in two corporations he set up to develop his inventions.
Two officers from the air force inspector general's special investigations staff brought about discovery of the old planes, now falling apart.

Dear Judge:

Re: Gray Goose Airways

Mr. William A. Driggers, of 1530 Olive St., N.E., Wash.,
D. C., was in my office on April 3, and informed that J. E.
Caldwell, the prime mover and secretary-treasurer, and general
manager of the subject is located at Old Frederick Road and Ingleside
Avenue, lately from which place he is attempting to sell stock to
the citizens of Maryland. According to Mr. Driggers' statement, he
has already sold some shares to Sergt. Johnson, initials not given,
who is stationed at the Aviation Base at Aberdeen, Md.

He also stated that a Carl H. Davis, who is a brother of
Mrs. Caldwell, is selling stock. As we understand it, this has been
a stock jobbing proposition for a number of years, and I find in my
files on November 25, 1936, we wrote to Mr. O'Conor, the then Attorney-
General, copy of which letter is probably in your file; but received
no reply.

We find from our records that this matter might bear a
little investigation under our Blue Sky Act.

The writer will be glad to assist in any way.

                                                ODD PLANE TEST NEARS

FORT CHESTER, N. Y. -- A new type airplane, designed to rise ver-
tically from the ground and remain virtually motionless at any place
the pilot chooses, he3 been built by two inventors from France work-
ing secretly in a secluded barn near Ridge Street here. Work on the
odd craft, which has no wings, has been completed and a test flight
is planned soon.

The plane looks like six ferris wheels clustered around an
engine and mounted on a lightweight automobile chassis. In a preview
to visitors who hurdled a high barbed wire fence on which were
posted signs to keep away, the inventors reluctantly demonstrated
how the.huge wheels would turn at a speed of 200 revolutions a minute
and perhaps lift the plane skyward. By shifting a lever, the plane
would move forward, backward or sideways, the inventors said.

The "ferris wheels" extended from the engine in every direction
and attached to each are three blades to serve as dippers in the air.
With each downward thrust they are expected to lift the plane. As the
blades pass upward their pitch is changed to cause them to slip through
the air. Bicycle chains serve to transmit power. In a brief test, the
inventors said, they had to struggle to hold the plane on the ground.

The craft is about 20 feet high and 25 feet wide and long. It is
made of wood, steel, aluminum and canvas. The power plant is a 98-
horsepower Wright engine.

Mr. Ivan Zandt, one of the inventors, said he received the in-
spiration 12 years ago while watching a ferris wheel in Paris, where he
was a manufacturer. Louis Chequet, the other inventor, became inter-
ested later.

Mr. Van Zandt said a miniature model of the plane was demonstrated
in Washington. The advantages of his craft would be many, he contended.
Farmers could fly at low levels and spray their crops, he explained.
Motion picture camera men could remain motionless over a scene and
ordinary citizens could go on Sunday jaunts at altitudes of 10 to 100
feet.

Mr. Chequet was born in France and Mr. Van Zandt has lived there
most of his life although he is an American citizen. They came to this
country about four years ago to file patents on their inventions and
to build the plane. The work was begun at Richmond Hill, Queens, and
was transferred to Port Chester six months ago.

Report concerning Diso-rotor airplane
bearing G.A.A.A. registration IX-991.
Gray Goose Airways, Inc.,
Washington, D. C.

UNCLASSIFIED

Date: March 8, 1959. Time: 3:00-5:30 P.M. Place: Old Beming Race Track.

On Wednesday afternoon from 3 to 5:30, a series of taxiing tests were undertaken with a view to determining the directional stability of the new tricycle landing gear which had just been installed, and other handling characteristics of the airplane on the ground. The afternoon was bright and sunny with a gentle breeze from the ligh[t]west, and conditions favorable.

A series of runs was made both up and down wind, at various speeds. The nose-wheel proved to be stable at speeds approaching 20 miles per hour, but at low speeds was less stable. A pair of cables and springs were then attached to the nose-wheel fork in such a manner as to tend to hold the wheel in a fore-and-aft line, and the taxiing tests were continued with the following results:

There was a noticeable improvement in the directional stability of the nose-wheel at the lower speeds, and no discernible difference in stability at the higher speeds. A run was then made at a speed assumed to be near that necessary for take-off, and the pilot and undertook witnesses still agree that the airplane left the ground at least a foot and a half and flew for some distance. It settled back to the ground easily as the throttle was closed, and gave no indication of the lack of control which was discovered on the next attempt.

In the meanwhile the breeze had shifted to the Southwest, and the next run was made in an opposite direction to those previous. The pilot had no thought of taking his airplane into the air more than 5 feet or two and did not even fasten the belt. While taxiing at about 25 miles an hour the airplane suddenly left the ground, ascended at a very steep angle to a height of approximately 25 feet, fell off in a left turn and struck the ground. The left side landing gear leg received the full force of the fall, and collapsed. One rotor vane also struck the grown, and there was minor damage.

In this involuntary take-off the airplane ballooned upward with startling rapidity, and efforts to correct its attitude by visual disposition of the controls were unavailing. The diso-rotor which was unlocked during these tests, began to rotate during the fall, according to the witnesses. The pilot was impressed by the slowness of the fall and the not-too-violent impact with the ground.

Conclusions.
1. The airplane has an abundance of lift.
2. The airplane has ample horsepower.
3. The airplane lacks both lateral and longitudinal control and is therefore unsafe until these faults are corrected.

Recommendations
1. An accurate model of the present airplane should be put through complete and comprehensive tests in a reputable wind-tunnel to ascertain the travel of the center of pressure, the direction and magnitude of lift and drag forces and vectors, the necessary area and placing of the elevators, and a more practical means of lateral control.

509 Calvert Building,
Baltimore, Maryland.

Dear Mr. Loebner:

With further reference to the whereabouts of Gray Goose Airways, I have uncovered the following information.

From a stockholder in Aberdeen, Maryland, I learned that Caldwells are now operating under the name "Rotor Planes, Inc." The new set-up is supposed to be incorporated under the laws of Maryland, and is supposed to be taking over the assets of Gray Goose Airways, Inc. Stockholders in the latter are being asked to forward money to have their stock transferred into the new company. The details of this transition are set forth in a 3-page circular letter, accompanied by an artist's conception of Mr. Caldwell's most revolutionary flying machine, and a paper to be signed and returned with money if the victim wishes his stock registered in the new company. It would seem that Caldwells are carefully selecting the stockholders whom they wish to know of the change; I am a stockholder but have not received any such notice.

"Rotor Planes, Inc." have taken box 98 at the Post Office at Glen Burnie, Maryland. I made extensive investigations at Glen Burnie this date and find that Caldwells have taken a farm house and barn for their headquarters, about three miles south of Glen Burnie on the old Annapolis Road, State Route #2.

I trust this information will enable you to proceed.

Very truly yours,

Mr. John W. Loeber, Atty. at Law,
809 Calvert Building,
Baltimore, Maryland.

Dear Mr. Loeber:

This is to acknowledge your letter of May 10 stating that Gray Goose Airways had departed from their location in Catonsville. I made the same discovery the day before your letter was received, and a large portion of my time since then has been spent in endeavoring to locate them.

The house which Caldwell rented at 4205 Military Road N.W. is now vacant. I contacted the owner (at 3615 Cumberland Street, N.W.) and was informed that the Caldwells moved out May last. and left no forwarding address. This party (name not ascertained) stated that a letter had since been received from Mrs. Caldwell promising a meeting in the near future. I gathered that Caldwells skipped, owing some rent.

I went to the City Post Office and tried to ascertain if a forwarding address had been left, either for the company lock-box (#652) or their personal mail, but this information was denied me. I then went to the office of the Postal Inspector and related the whole story. An assistant to the Chief Clerk there stated that if you would write in as my attorney requesting this information, there is a possibility it would be made available to you.

I also went to the Securities and Exchange Commission and acquainted them with the latest developments.

The office of the company at 1225 New York Avenue N.W. has been moved from the fifth to the third floor, but I believe this is maintained only as a "front". There are no signs of life about.

Some time ago I traced the identity of their mechanic, one Marcus Armistead, through auto tag numbers, finding that he resided at 1435 Morse Street N.E. I called at this address, but the mother-in-law professed ignorance of the whereabouts of Gray Goose Airways. Knowing that Armistead spent the week-ends in Washington, I shadowed this man Sunday night and Monday mornings as he left for work. I followed him nearly to Baltimore when he turned off to the right going down thru Glen Burnie and finally into Annapolis. I lost him at a traffic light in Annapolis at the intersection of King George, East, and Randell

The building they occupied in Catonsville is rented thru Chas. H. Steffey, 336 North Charles Street, Baltimore. There is a possibility Steffey knows where his late tenants have gone.

None of the stockholders in this area have any knowledge of their whereabouts. Every act of this outfit indicates that they are out to beat the public; if we catch up with them again would suggest that no leniency be shown.

The airplanes, engines, tools, materials, etc. which they abandoned in the old shop at 923 Kenilworth Ave., N.E., was sold at public auction last Friday under orders of the U. S.

Air Force Does 'Saucer' Story
WASHINGTON, Aug. 20.—(INS)—The Air force today ex-pressed the theory that a New Mexico plane found in a "dis- mantled state" may have been mis- took for a flying saucer where pi-loted tobacco tin men are employed to have been seen.' The revelation of the "flying saucer" story is a gag, or originating somewhere in the realm of lore.

Latest 'Flying Saucer' Mystery Clue Dissolved
LAS VEGAS, Nev., Aug. 25 (AP) He said he dropped the project and left Maryland years ago because it couldn't obtain financing. His current interest? It's the "auto-swing," a new invention that looks something like a flying har- vesting machine.

Caldwell, bald but alert as a cricket, had nothing to do with the thing.

Caldwell had been identified as the inventor of two disk-like aircraft models found last week in a tool shed near Mays. Md. He's out of town right now, but his attorney, Emile Wanderer,

Air Force Finds Odd Planes Hint "Flying Saucers" Type
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.—(UP)—The United States air force, in cooperation with Maryland state police, tonight revealed in an "flying saucer" type aircraft in an abandoned tool-shed at Marriottsville, Md., and is described in unusual.

The contraptions, which an air force spokesman said gave the appearance of "flying discs" and one of which is reported to have flown were discovered by the force of its rapid investigation which for years has been probing into the "flying saucer" mystery, which few tangible results.

Capt. Marious Belt, head of the Baltimore, Md., detachment of the air force office of special investigation, said the investigation had disclosed the two machines, since he built the unique machines. They he had not personally viewed them himself. They appear to be improved model now under construction. Capt. Belt has said and one was found in the craft. He said the craft looks somewhat like a helicopter. It has two thin shells which are past together by "tacks" the remains suggested the engineers devised a machine, as yet uncompleted, which he said he had found out the amount of about had located some sections "as neat have a diameter of a shaft that Caldwell would like very much of the greater.

The air force conceded that some of them may have "gone aloft" but added that they said not all of their touted be "that one that made "craft could possibly have made a successful flight.

It near the end that were in such stipulated condition they neither could have flown "recent enough" to have been the rise in saucer clippings recently. States this regional over the saucer belief.

FLYING DISC
Model Flown
Successfully

A prototype model of a "flying disk aircraft" has been developed in Glendale and flown successfully with wire controls, it was learned yesterday.

Dr. E. W. Kay, 228 S Kenwood St., said the flying model is about five feet in diameter and weighs 11 pounds 3 ounces.

The prototype will rise and descend vertically and also hover, he claims. Of all-metal construction, it utilizes a small model engine and propeller for horizontal thrust and an ordinary flin...

Stationary Cockpit
The larger portion of the disk spins about the stationary cockpit section, the inventor explained, adding:
"For security reasons, details of construction cannot be revealed at present, but there are special automatic devices for auxiliary lifts."
Kay emphasized that his prototype disk has not been tried in flightable and can not have been responsible for any report of flying saucers.

Shucks! Flying Saucer Ideas
Ridiculed By Plane Inventor

---

LAS VEGAS, Nev., Sept. 2 – (AP) – The man who invented and built the man-powered flound wrecked and abandoned in a Glendale hauling site also says it has "absolutely no relation whatsoever" to any flying saucers that may have been seen in this country or any other.

"I'm from time to time looked at the Glen Burnie "what-is-it" he expressed belief it is definitely the prototype of the flying saucer.

"Shucks, I have that thing up in 1939," Jonathan E. Caldwell, 68-year-old Manhattan Beach, Calif., building contractor and inventor who formerly lived in Glendale, told a newsman here. "If the Air Force wants to know anything about it they're welcome to what ever I know."

Caldwell said the plane was tested by Winton by Digre in 1939-1940, that it was granted an experimental license by the Commerce Department. He said it was powered by a seven-cylinder engine in the nose, was propeller-driven and the disk was a safety factor.

Caldwell is working in a small shop here, trying to perfect another radical plane that involves a wide wing and a safety factor described as the "cyclo-dia," his other 17 years ago by Dr. Adolph Rohrback of Berlin.

Caldwell says his plane has been tested at the Ontario, Calif., but the conventional type fuselage has the wings look like glider wings. They are 8 feet in diameter, above the longitudinal axis of the fuselage are the two rotor wings, 20 feet long.

AIR FORCE DISOWNS 'FLYING DISK' FINDS

Says Old Maryland Machines Have No Relation At All to 'Saucer' Phenomena

NEW YORK TIMES 20 AUGUST 1949

WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (AP) - The Air Force today said that two old machines found in a Maryland tobacco shed yesterday "have absolutely no connection with the reported phenomena of flying saucers."

The announcement ended speculation that the contraptions may have been the early experimental models of today's objects that have been reported whizzing through the air from time to time. Several sightings unknown to its was after Bottling Field here divaliations had been located in Mary[land]. A shed near Green Burr[ie], Md," State Police found the real[ics] about 18 miles south of Balti[imore].
Air Force officials at first ex[pressed belief they may have been] "prototypes" of early models of flying saucers.

Today, however, the Air Force officially disclaimed any such view. It took the position unequivocally that it could "not recognize anything as a 'prototype' of something that has not been proven to exist."

Some "flying saucer" reports --- which have come in from coast to coast --- have been traced to weather balloons and natural pheonmena, and others have remained unexplained.

One of the machines found in Maryland looked like a rude helicopter, with two big circular devices on top. The other resembled a large woodwork tub, with an engine and cockpit inside.

Their inventor, Jonathan E[dwell], has long disappeared, but his strange devices hung dust and decay for a decade.
