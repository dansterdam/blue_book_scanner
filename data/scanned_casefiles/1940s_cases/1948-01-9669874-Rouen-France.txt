****************************************************
FEB. 1,1948 CIRCLEVILLE, OHIO
IN THE EARLY HOURS OF FEBRUARY 1, THE OWNER OF A BIG MODERN FARM; MR.
[KEYHOE-1960 P. 144] WITNESS
HE LEFT HIS HOUSE HE SAW A SAUCER-SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING ABOVE THE
BUILDINGS. IT WAS ABOUT SIXTY FEET IN DIAMETER, TEN TO TWELVE FEET THICK, AND
IT LOOKED METALLIC. IN THE CENTER WAS A DOME THROUGH WHICH SHONE A BLINDING
ORANGE LIGHT.
FROM THE OBJECT'S TILTED POSITION, IT APPEARED THAT SOMEONE INSIDE THE DOME
WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE BLUISH-GREEN GLOW FROM THE FARROWING-HOUSE WINDOWS.
AFTER A MOMENT, THE OBJECT MOVED INTO A LEVEL POSITION, THEN IT PASSED OVER
ANOTHER FARM BUILDING AND WAS HIDDEN FROM VIEW. BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED, THE
LIGHT IN THE DOME CHANGED TO A DIM AMBER, BUT THE MAN WAS UNABLE TO SEE
INSIDE.
