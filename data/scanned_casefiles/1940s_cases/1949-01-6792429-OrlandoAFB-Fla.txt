Aerial Mystery Baffles Chief 1 February 1949

'Flying Disc' Visits Pinellas

By C. WYNN LENCHUCK
Those "Men from Mars" might be going between 400 and 500 miles per hour. It was perfectly round and appeared to be as large as four of the big planes. The object towered over the city in army planes. The object formed a complete circle and threw out a strange greenish light with four strange greenish lights."

Previous, on the odd whim, witnesses, Kramer Thomas, Previously,
Among the first to report the Palmetto, reported to fishermen of the Aloma encountered the Flying object was E. Sensenbrenner, an auto mechanic at the plant. The pattern is always whirling disc. . . along about
Wilson's Hi Hat Body and Fender the coast. MacDill Field about 300 miles per hour . . throwing
Palmetto, reported to fishermen of out a strange greenish light with
W.E. Taylor that he saw a "plane" fishing near four white streaks."

Never as the "whirling discs". Recently during day-
light observation point of. Aloma. Alabama saw the heads of the passengers
showing through the windows
of the monster which was as big as a freight car, re-
ported, and which whizzed by
his plane which was flying
along at a 150 mile clip.

The apparition (or is it?) has
been attributed to:

1. Men from Mars.
2. Russian spies.
3. Secret army planes.
4. Low moth fog.

City Publicity Director, Press Phillips takes a saner view: "Uh, doubtedly," Phillips stated, passing briefly from his daily chores of mailing pictures of girls in swim suits to Northern news-
papers, "undoubtedly, what these people saw yesterday was ac-
tually men from Mars who had heard about the wonders of St. Petersburg and the Gulf Beaches. Thus far none of these visitors from another planet have regis-
tered at the chamber of com-
merce but I shall certainly notify The Evening Independent just
as soon as they do. I understand
people from Mars have little
green cards and I fear their
tropedoes and I believe I will
conquer them".

NOTE: Shame a
"L.J.U.", and you too, Press
Phillips for not recognizing as
winter visitor in a hurry to get
away from it all. The "hall"
shape? Merely snow and ice
pilled in a fast trip from the
Mid-west.

The image shows a page that looks like a newspaper clipping with text and two illustrations. The first illustration appears to be a header with the text "CITY DESK", and it features a drawing of a man sitting at a desk with his feet up, talking on the telephone. The second illustration is a comic strip-like drawing located at the bottom left of the page. It depicts a figure looking up at an object in the sky with the captions "IT'S A BIRD! IT'S A PLANE..." implying surprise or confusion about the unidentified flying object.

SYNOPSIS
Investigation requested by Commanding General, Air Material Command,
Wright-Patherson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. An unidentified airborne lighted
object with pulsating light, bluish-green in color, round and the approximate
size of an automobile wheel was sighted in the vicinity of Orlando Air Force Base,
Orlando and Winter Park, Florida, by 5 Air Policemen and 3 Civilian Policemen
sometime between the hours of 0115 and 0200, 31 January 1949. A total of 8 points
of observation located within a radius of 7 miles report this object to be
between 2000 and 4575 above the horizon and the line of general Southwesterly direction
all aircraft departing this area, begin thier flights. On observer stated
this object was "crazy", spanking along-spanking in a manner that a boat makes bailing
in calm water. Speed of the object was reported to be less than the expected plane
aircraft approaching land, too "Extraneously fast". All observers reported that
no fire or smoke trailed the object. The color of this object was basi-
whally green in color. Two of the observers reported the object as leaving a slight
halo in approximating its end, no "Extraneously fast". All observers reported that
no fire or smoke trailed the object. The color of this object was basi-
whally green in color. Two of the observers reported the object as leaving a slight
halo in approximating its end, no "Jet Was reported to be from that of a light
aircraft. One source of the object was really fast". All observers reported that
there was no sound, odor, projectiles or trail to the object. However, one person
who did not observe this object, advised that shortly after the approximate times
the observation he smelled a peculiar odor similar to that of garbage burning in
an incinerator in the vicinity of Orlando Municipal Airport. All observers
reported that object did not appear to go below the horizon but was lost to sight
when it went behind buildings or trees in line of vision. The flight path was
described by most of the observers as generally straight and level with a slight
angle of assent. One observer reported a slight dip and curry in the flight
path and another reported an s motion. Periods of observation varied from 3 to 90
seconds. During the reported flight of this object over Orlando and vicinity the
weather was clear, stars were out, there was no moon or clouds and all observers
had good visibility. All observers are regarded as reliable, did not wear eye
glasses, and with the exception of 2, who viewed the object through automobile
windshields

in or around this object. The color of this object appeared to be very dull and
it appearing "like a lighted weather balloon", then wavered and then moved off, finally
disappearing "as it started as a rather stag descent and clouded over down the sky.
the stars were out and it was turned off. There were no visual underneaths. Cheek did not wear glasses, is not color-blind and did not view this object through any material.

earnance to navigation lights on aircraft and about the si4e of a Fiat at an arms
length as a position approximately 20° above the horizon and over a point
approximately 1 1/4 miles at 225° from his position. This object was in sight for
approximately 50 seconds. It was traveling in a slightly South-southwesterly dir-
ection at a slight angle of descent and at a speed approximating that of an air-
craft approaching Orlando Air Field. There was no sound, odor, trail or projections
in or around this object. It appeared to be very dull in color, similar to a weak
incandescent lamp and disappeared from view behind trees which were in his

FIREBALL REPORT

1949 JAN. 13-14 FIREBALL
A.M.S. No. 2351

On this date at 5:20 p.m., E.S.T., a bright fireball was observed by 7 persons who reported, one living in New York, one in New Jersey, and 5 in Pennsylvania. Two gave complete reports, one fairly complete, two were more or less reference points, one was quite incomplete. Thanks mostly to Z. A. Hill, then at Princeton, N.J., Co., Pa., who saw the object full vertically, a fair solution was derived. The object seems to have broken over Philadelphia and all the material was carried off below Philadelphia. Org. N.J. was 5o E., New Jersey green, he did not have a long enduring train and its duration was 4±2 seconds (no observer). Two initial data follow so orbit is computed due to uncertainty in altitude of the radiant.

"Flying Saucers—There Aren't Any, AF Decides

WASHINGTON, Dec. 30—After chewing up on 35 rush orders over the holiday weekend, the Air Force has concluded there aren't any flying saucers. 
"It took just three special agents from the USAF’s air materiel command, nine top rank university consultants to track down the rumors of strange disks whizzing through the air. 
"Last night the Air Force said through military spokesmen The "investigation started by the Air Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson on June 24. 1947, has come to a definite conclusion—there is nothing and never has been, proved nor indicated. There were not the results of anything man-made, experimental devices or natural phenomena. 
"Rather, the investigation of various conventional phenomena made from -as far as the service can ascertain—the flying saucer mystery was the figment of a vivid or inexperienced imagination of those seeing them, or various conventional objects.
