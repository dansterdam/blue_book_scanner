The image appears to be a photocopy of an official document with text and a single black and white image. The image is quite small and shows a curved, elongated object that looks somewhat cylindrical with frayed edges or ends, similar to a piece of debris or material. It's difficult to definitively describe the object as the details are not clear.

MEMORANDUM REPORT ON                                     Date: 15 December 1948
 
SUBJECT: Unidentified Metal and Earth Samples

OFFICE: MATERIALS LABORATORY                           Contract or Order No.

SERIAL NO. IR-4-AC-206-71                              Expenditure Order No. 720-73

A. PURPOSE:

1. To analyze the metal and earth samples submitted by the
Technical Intelligence Division of the Intelligence Department in
connection with Project Sign.

B. FACTUAL DATA:

2. The samples were contained in an envelope with the return
address, L. D. Paden, Chief of Police, Bellefontaine, Ohio, written in the
upper left hand corner. These exhibits were delivered by the Project Sign
Officer, to whom the residues were returned. The first sample, Physics
Branch Serial No. 1713J consisted of several pieces of metal and some
dirty white material mixed in with some soil-like material. Figure 1
shows this exhibit, the arrangement of the metal pieces as suggested by
the Project Sign. officer. The second sample, Physics Branch Serial
No. 1714J is reported to be soil from the area sample P. B. 1713J
was picked up. It is shown in Figure 2.

3. Spectrographic analysis of the metal in P. B. 1713J indicated
it to be zinc with minor amounts of lead, sodium, and calcium present
with traces of magnesium, copper, iron, and silicon. The dirty white
clinks in P. B. 1713J contained magnesium as the principal metallic con-
stituent with a major amount of sodium present. Zinc was present in a
minor amount with traces of titanium, manganese, iron and calcium. The
fine material of P. B. 1713J was found to have major amounts of magnesium,
zinc, silicon, aluminum, and sodium with minor amounts of iron and lead,
and traces of titanium, chromium, boron, and calcium.

4. The brown earth-like material in P. D. 1714J contained
major amounts of silicon, aluminum, and iron with minor amounts of sodium,
magnesium, and titanium, and traces of boron, calcium, manganese copper,
and chromium. The white material in sample P. B. 1714J contained major
amounts of silicon, magnesium, aluminum, zinc, iron, and sodium with a
minor amount of titanium and traces of boron, manganese, calcium, and
copper.

5. Comparison of the spectrographic data obtained for the soil and the various portions of the residue was made. On the basis of the relative amounts present, zinc, magnesium, sodium, led., and cadmium are the elements which appear to be most significant.

6. None of the submitted exhibits gave any indication of the presence of radioactive materials when tested by means of a Geiger counter (Cyclotron Specialties Model 310A) or ionization chamber type radiation survey meter (Technical Lab SL-1).

C. CONCLUSIONS:

7. The exhibits contained zinc, magnesium, sodium, and lead which are typical constituents of flares and other exploding devices.

D. RECOMMENDATIONS:

None - data merely submitted.

Fiery Wheel
Now Believed
War Souvenir

The mysterious "flaming wheel" which crashed to earth near Bellefontaine, O., Friday night amid a shower of flame and smoke was made in the U. S. A., "Wright-Field" authorities believed today.

Probability is over a souveniring an Air Materiel Command (AMC) spokesman commented this morning. Investigation through the investigation is not yet completed.

It indicates also that the fragments are those of a wartime Navy and Air Force type used by the flame rate, of the crews. It was of the type customarily fired by a Very pistol, it is understood.

City of the "flaming wheel" at East Liberty Friday night caused Considerable excitement.

Witnesses said the "wheel" continued to burn after striking the ground. Patrolmen Murray Reiner investigated and tried to pick up the object. His hands, his badge, found in them, the material. [Text cuts off]

Indications are that the war souvenir had been fired by a private citizen, probably a veteran.

IT LIGHTED the entire area and smoked out 50-by-fifty tents. It also scared most pedestrians back.

Police Chief A. D. Paden said the remains of the object looked like a tire rim of an airplane or automobible. He said the insides of the tire rim were incised in what “appears to be mysterious handwork.”

He said the condition of the salvaged bits of metal indicated one object had been subjected to exceptionally high heat.

At Wright Field, meanwhile, Col. C. W. Welch, public relations officer, said field officials were anxious to examine the remains of the object.

He said he knew of no experiments being conducted at the field that could supply an answer to the mystery.

Police Chief E.W. Paisley said it looked outwardly hardened plastic-like remains of the object looked like a rim like of an airplane tire about the size of this mysterious wheel disintegrated in the hands of a patrolman who sought to salvage the remains.
The wheel's remnants, the chief added, were bent on the Wright Field, some 45 miles south of here, for a study.
