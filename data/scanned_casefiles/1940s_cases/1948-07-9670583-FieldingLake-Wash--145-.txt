UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #145 -- Fielding Lake -- 9 July 1948

The lack of any exhaust trail and luminosity eliminates
an astronomical explanation for the objects reported here.
It seems more probable that they were distant aircraft
flying in formation, or migrating birds.

The image contains a document with text and a formation of circles arranged above the text, which seems to be a representation of the objects in question from the report. The circles seem to be arranged in a specific pattern, possibly to depict the movement or formation of the UFOs described. Below is the text contained in the document as requested:

---
color and numbering about 20. They were plainly visible and either
spheroid or disc shaped. They appeared to be jockeying back and forth
in the group formation which gave the overall impression of a squadron
blast pattern. The objects were thought to be moving in excess of 500 MPH
at approximately 5,000 ft (immediately below the clouds) from NW to SE
and were definitely flying a straight course. Just before they were
sighted a loud roaring sound was heard which was attributed to a strong
wind blowing through the surrounding woods. However, as the object
approached and passed, the sound sharpened into a buzz much like that made
by a group of jet aircraft. No exhaust trails were visible. There were no
photographs available.
