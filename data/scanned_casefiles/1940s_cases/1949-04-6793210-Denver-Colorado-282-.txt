    On 7 April 1949, the District Commander, 4601st AI[S] Depot, Lowry AF
Base, revealed to English/Baker report forms while making a personal visit at 
the 393d Aerial Port Squadron Offices when he and his wife had sighted a mysterious
ill-defined "an object" that they could not name while parked at the parking area
of the Stapleton Airports, Denver, Colorado. An above FS3 Agent avowd that he did know
believe this object he observed was any known aircraft as it traveled horizontally
and was invisible. FS3 Agent made crude chalk marks in mud and snow at locations
to take the approximate bearings and landing points where the phenomen 
was seen and observed. 

    Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Sullivan, who saw this phenomena in Avondale Ranch
Lane, had observed the same aerial object or phenomenon traveling first downhill much
faster than a 100. weather balloon, aither stations at Stapleton Fields, Denver, had
relased a 100 inch weather balloon that was lit, a standard, at approximately second 
time mark thereof. Agents made mud and snow marks and sighted this above-
mentioned object.

    On 8 April 1949 at 2000 hours, Agent made the aforementioned 
the writer to the U. S. Weather Station at Stapleton Airports and was accompanied 
another weather balloon, with light, released. It was then cuiciosly 
identified the weather balloon as the objects he had seen the previous night

2. Additional information which is authentic in nature but doubt-
ful as to value follows:

radio from 2230 to 2240Z hours 6 April 1949. Also there was unusual
high noise level noticed on low frequency receivers at approximately
the same time.

hours, 6 April 1949, due to high noise level on "I" "Charlie" channel-
of Very High Frequency equipment.

of the equipment involved and could not necessarily be construed to
be an unusual occurrence of any particular nature.
