Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

At 2015 p.m., at Olney, Maryland, I glanced at the sky and noticed a fairly
wide streak of ribbon or luminosity, perhaps a degree in width, which seemed to be
extending itself irregularly downward as I watched. I focused my 7 x 50 binoculars on
this light, and saw what was reported as a long cloud of luminosity, with no sharp 
boundaries. The first few minutes, I saw that the cloud extended no nearly
and seemed to glow or scintillate about as much as the zenith to about 15 degrees of the
southern horizon. The ends were thin, evenly toward across the entire band, but the
central portion assumed the feature of two parallel lines of light, marking the edges
of the ribbon, then became increasingly bright.

The whole mass in motion, for in about a minute it turned toward the east,
and the bright portion in mashed up, with a distinct curl of light rising from its
while the edge of the fainter part of the ribbon broke into two arms, one upward to
the east, the other downward to the south. Finally, about two minutes later, the 
brighter portion, moving fairly rapidly eastward, but at about a constant altitude,
had ceased to form a broad, bluntly pointed head (somewhat like a large comet), 
with two dimmer tails curving upward and downward. In another minute, the whole had
faded, but did not entirely die out for perhaps three minutes more.

I am sufficiently familiar with astronomical occurrences to be sure this was
not a meteoritic phenomenon nor a display of aurora borealis, and it certainly was not
a comet. It may well be something quite normal of occurrence, and if so, I should 
appreciate your kindness in laying one of the staff of the observatory subject to me
what it may have been.

Dear ██████:

Receipt of your letter, dated 13 May 1949, is acknowledged by 
this headquarters.

Your reported sighting of an unidentified aerial phenomenon
has been made a matter of record and is being incorporated into our
present study of this subject. It is unfortunate the exact date of
observation was not remembered as this factor is of considerable
importance if comparison with known aerial objects is to be made.
It is hoped your memory refreshed through the enclosed Air Force
information form will reveal the date of this incident.

The enclosed questionnaires may be used as an outline in recording
pertinent information to the sighting mentioned in your letter.
It is desired that the completed forms be directed to:

Commanding General

Washington 5, D.C.
May 13, 1949

Technical Intelligence Division

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

Last month I observed a phenomenon in the sky that I
assumed to be astronomical, and as I could not identify it, I wrote
to the Harvard Observatory in this; The Observatory answered that
it was not astronomical, and as a phenomenal not strictly [?]
writes in the Saturday Evening Post that you wish to be informed
of such observations, so I am addressing you on the subject.
My reason for writing is partly that someone else may have reported
the same event to you, and my notes will serve as verification.

Unfortunately, I do not recall the exact date. I you
wish, you can obtain it by procuring my letter from the Harvard
Observatory, which was written half an hour after the occurrence.
I believe it was on April 13 or 23.

At 10:15, P.M., I returned to my home at Unity, Maryland,
about 25 miles north of Washington, D.C., five miles north of
Olney, Md. It was a dark, moonless night, with fair horizon-to-
starlight, and --I had no lights in the air, sky, and mist.
There was no wind; a damp made up the weather pattern and looked
a rather faint broad streak of luminosity about 50 degrees above
the horizon. The lower end appeared to be dropping toward the
southern horizon.

I carry 7 x 50 binoculars in the car, so I immediately
got them out and focussed them on this light. It appeared brighter
through the glasses, and could be seen to be a ribbon of light,
perhaps one or two degrees wide, elongating radially toward the
ground. The upper and lower end of this band were rather faint,
but the central portion was much brighter. This central portion
formed two very bright parallel streaks, with fainter luminosity
between them. I could see nothing that appeared to be solid,
and there were no sparks or other lights evident. This condition
is shown in sketch #1.

About 20 degrees above the horizon, the lower end
stopped descending, and turned suddenly eastward. I went into
the house and asked ***, Seth E., Low to come out to see the light.
When we again focused the glasses on the object, perhaps a minute 
or two after I left the yard, the luminous tail had become much
shorter in stock to about the upper end was fading slowly, and another
band of light of about the same intensity now extended eastward to the
north; the bright portion was a little east of the junction of the
two, and had bunched up, with a small wave or bright light curling
up from it; this merged into a fairly luminous portion still
moving eastward.

Rather rapidly, the brighter portion seemed to absorb
the eastward prolongation, until the whole had somewhat the shape
of a comet with two tails. The "gast" was a bright, swirling cloud
of light, and looked a bit like an astronomical nebula down through
a telescope. Soon the entire light began to fade, and was gone
by 1030.

I am familiar with the appearance of northern lights,
comets and meteor tray, and in my this was none of those phenomena;
it was the same time am not convinced that it was not astronomical.
It was impossible to think of mete alike, when they displayed west in
distant space, Or objects to the earth, even though try glass which
mentioned in the other portion. Can see relatively few objects
illuminations is clearly too great. The observed too of the eastern's
lights on the southern horizon, and a collapsing balloon might
account for the highest step except that I had though explain the
long-lingering glow of the upper end of on the light on that basis, and
the actions of the light were on what ones might expect of a
collapsing balloon, even if wind were blowing in the higher altitudes.

I hope this rather sketchy account may be of some
interest to you. I presume that whatever I saw, it was some
perfectly normal occurrence, and nothing extraordinary.

Yours sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

The image contains three separate sketches labeled #1, #2, and #3. The sketches appear to depict unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

#1 shows a long, curved object with a shape somewhat reminiscent of a boomerang or a crescent.
#2 is a sketch of an object with a central bulge and blurred or fuzzy edges, giving an impression of motion.
#3 is a more detailed sketch of an oval-shaped object with what appears to be several portholes or lights, and lines suggesting movement or a trail behind it.
