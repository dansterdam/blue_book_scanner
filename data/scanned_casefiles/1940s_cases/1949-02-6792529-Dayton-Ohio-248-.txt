Incident No. 2 UU

Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Radars now operating on ground:

   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude, and size
      of target:

   b. Did targets execute any turns? If so, what angle (>90°), etc.,
      and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observable,
      how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed:

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into several
      targets upon approach:

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent with
      size of object; faint; fading, pulsating at regular rate:

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted

   a. Were there any radar indications or erraticness on radio circuits:

   b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.

ATMOSPHERE

1. Give sequence of local weather conditions.

2. Winds aloft report:

3.  Local flight schedules of commercial, private and military aircraft
    flying in vicinity at the time.
    (Check Canadian activity if close to border.)

4.  Possible sources of testing devices in vicinity such aloft by Ordnance
    Navy, Air Force, Army, Weather Units, Research Organizations or any
    other.

5.  If object contacted earth, obtain soil samples within and without de-
    pression or spot where object landed for purposes of making comparison
    of soils.

6.  Obtain photographs (or original negatives) where available; if not,
    secure sketches of:
    a.  Object
    b.  Surroundings as when object was observed
    c.  Place where object contacted earth (if this happened)
    d.  Mannerism
    e.  Formation (if more than two)

7.  Secure signed statements.

8.  Obtain fragments or physical evidence where possible.
