Ball Of Fire
In Night Sky
Awes Florida

MIAMI, Fla., June 6.—(UP)—
Thousands of Floridians wound-
ered today whether the explosive
ball of fire and trail of light
they saw in the sky last night
was a meteor, a bomb, or some-
thing even more mysterious.
Residents in every section of
the state saw the aerial explo-
sion, according to the highway patrol, which was swamped
with telephone calls from citi-
zens demanding to know what
had happened.
Police and authorities at mili-
tary installations also reported
seeing the “ball of fire” that
streaked across the sky.
At MacDill Field in Tampa,
the Army Flight Service ac-
knowledged having seen the phe-
nomenon but clamped a “re-
stricted” label on whatever fur-
ther information it had concern-
ing the flash.
Officers at MacDill Field said
that since the “flying saucer
scare” they had a practice of
withholding statements until
they could thoroughly explain
the cause of such phenomena.
Officials at the Naval airport
and Coast Guard here reported
that an explosion occurred with
a tremendous burst of light
across the sky at 7:50 p. m.
(EST). A trail of luminous
gases and particles streaked
across the sky for 50 to 60 miles,
they said, and was visible for
25 minutes.
Two forecasters at the Miami
weather bureau were outside
working with their instruments
and described the phenomenon.
T. L. Mcee said the sighted
object “appeared somewhat
smaller than a full moon. It lit
up the sky to the northwest and

fell vertically, leaving a lumin-
ous, weaving trail.”
W. R. Davis said he had never
seen anything like it before. “A
meteor usually flashes and is
gone,” he said, “but this was a
larger explosion than that of an
ordinary meteor and the tail re-
mained visible for at least 25
minutes.”

REFERENCE Report of S/A R. R. LUTTENT1, 10th District OSI, 21-39, 27 May 1949

OPNIS On 17 May 1949, multicolored light observed at 2130 hours, was visible for 
approximately 35 minutes. Light was stationary, color varied from white 
to blue with flashes of red.

On 23 May, four separate observations were made of six aerial phenomena. 
Observations were made at 1000, 0210, 0250, and period 2330 to 0900 hours.

On 3 June, civilian type aircraft made sharp turn, landing near res-
tricted area, damaging fence. Investigation by F. B. I. indicated no 
criminal motive.

On 6 June, unusual light observed at 2105 hours by two observers, and 
was in sight for two minutes and forty seconds. Same object was also 
observed by two other observers from a different azimuth.

On 13 June, unusual light observed at 2015 hours, in sight for approxi-
mately two to three seconds, moving very fast. On 13 June, unusual 
light was observed at 2300 hours by two officer observers for a period 
of from five to thirty seconds.

On 7 July, informal information received indicating Fourth Army made 
request for assistance of air Technical Intelligence Team from Head-
quarters Air Materiel Command.

1. On 7 May 1949, ***************** ast. [-?-], 2d
   Armored Division, observed an unusual light a CMP 100 yards.
   remained stationary for approximately 1-1/2 hours, was within, at map coordi-
   nate 915.5 - 564.5 and saw an object, brighter than stars. Object
   remained stationary for approximately thirty-five (35) minutes, was
   round and twice the size of the brightest star visible. Color varied,
   being predominantly white, with flashes of red. No
   maneuvers were observed, and the weather was generally fair with
   scattered clouds and a wind from the south, Velocity of about 15 miles
   per hour. Observer followed object both with the naked eye and through
   field glasses. The standard form "Guide to Investigation, Unidentified
   Aerial Objects" has been furnished. One copy is retained in files of
   District Office No. 19.

2. On 23 July 1949, ********************, I&T Company, 6th
   Tank Battalion, 2nd Armored Division, Camp Hood, Texas, observed an
   unusual Light. Observation was made at 2210 hours from Observation
   Post No. 1, map coordinate 901.0-650.0, saw an light about
   three feet in diameter, round in shape, and changing from blue to
   greenish yellow in color. The object was in sight for approximately
   two or three minutes, and was about 1,500 yards from the observer.
   Speed was slow and object appeared to grow. No maneuvers were noted.
   Observation was made without assistance of optical instruments. Object
   was north of the observer and traveled from east to west, then from
   west to east. 

   Division, Camp Hood, Texas, made observation at the same point and at
   the same time, and described the object as being two or three feet in
   diameter, smaller than the moon, was round and was red when first seen,
   then changed to a greenish color. Object was in sight for two to three
   minutes, traveled from east to west, then from west to east, disappear-
   ing, then re-appearing, moving slowly when first sighted, travelling some-
   what faster on second observation. Flight was level and the object
   appeared to glow like a "light through a window". No optical instru-
   ments were used in the observation.

of a star and the moon, or alj-t thi- siz- of 'ai automobile headlight. It was round with blurred edges and had a yellowish tinge to its color. Object was more than a mile away and was northeast of the observers; remained in sight for one or two minutes and moved from left to right at a slow speed. Its color was dull like a "flashlight covered by yellow paper". eather was clear with a light wind from the south, with a small amount of haze. Po optical instruments were used. Object moved in Level Flight, enroute mile directly to A.C by Fourth Army, and copy retained in files of o. O. No. 10.

5. On 23 l&y 19L9, between the hours 2330 and 00∠0, three observers saw a recurring light. Observers were______
_______"D" Company, l& 2 ARB, Camp Hood, Texas______
42nd AIB, Camp Hood, Texas. Object appeared and then re-appeared several times. Described as being the size of a light bulb when held at arm's length, round in shape, and with a color of that of a light bulb at a distance. Time of sighting was approximately one minute, and movement was straight up and down at slow speed. Weather was clear with southerly winds, and a slight haze. No sound or odor was observed. No trail noted and no projections seen on object by observers. Individual reports from each of the three observers furnished A/C by Fourth Army with copy being retained in the files of D. O. No. 10.

6. On the night of 3 June,...9., at 2020 hours, a civilian type aircraft circled Camp Hood at an altitude of from 200 to 300 feet. At completion of second circling, airplane was headed due east.

as the result of the emergency landing, in two loose posts from cornfield, out of shape, and forty-five feet of concealed wire material, torn loose and streached. As the pilot lost altitude rapidly, the interior was subjected to the F. B. I., and a report couldn't be had from San Antonio Field Office of that organization indicates that this pilot has since been under observation while residing at 1515 Wallace St., Taylor, Texas. The aircraft was a Ballanca, known; red in color, No. NC 14105. Investigation by the F. B. I. indicated nothing unfavorable regarding subject's loyalty to the United States.

7. On 6 June 1949, "C" Battery, 740th AAA Bn., 4th AFA Bn, and HQ Battery, "C" Battery, 740th AAA Bn., Camp Hood, Texas, observed aerial light. The observers were at Artillery OP No. 2, Camp Hood, Texas, map coordinate 913-CCF-755.350. Time of observations was approximately 2155 hours. The object was in sight for two minutes and forty seconds. Object was described as being initially one, distintegrating into smaller particles as it lost sight. The size was 2 to 3 miles, in a BC Scope. Object was approximately one mile above the surface as described as being round emitting a dull orange in color, similar to a ball of fire. Object observed through BC Scope, and initially appeared stationary, then moved in level flight, being tracked with constant turn on BC Scope. The object seemed to disintegrate into smaller objects which disappeared in a fraction of a second. The sky was overcast, but the object was described as being dull as a flashlight with black-out disk. No sound or odor was observed.

8. Same object was observed by:

Batter, 92d AFA Bn, and Lieut. A. McD. JONES, "C" Battery, 92d AFA Bn., Camp Hood, Texas from Artillery Observation Post No. 1, Camp Hood, Texas, map coordinates 913-CCC 577.700. The second set of observers indicated the object to have been on or perhaps two side by side, round in shape and yellow or orange in color. Size was about that of a dime held at arms length. Observers stated object was fairly dull until it burst, and upon bursting parts went up and down and faded out. OP No. 1 observed object on an azimuth of ≈210 mils, and OP No. 2 observed on an azimuth 2771 mils. Report on form "Guide to Investigation, Unidentified Aerial Objects" furnished by both sets of observers to AA/C through Fourth Army. Copies of these reports are on file in D.O. No. 10.

9. On 13 June 1949, Hq. 92d AFA Bn., Camp Hood, Texas, observed aerial light at approximately 2015 hours. Observer was walking south on 162nd Street, near intersection of Hq. Avenue, Camp Hood, Texas, and saw one bright light in the sky, the size of a flare; described as being round, white in color with a pink trail.

10. On 13 June, **** at Camp
Hood, Texas, at approximately 2000 hours, observed a brilliant litt;
in the sky. Observer was studying in his room in the rear of the
Camp Hood Officers' Club and saw this brilliant light similar to a
meteorite. Estimated size 300 to 700 feet in width, extension to
the rear 1000 yards. The object was glowing with color, white to a
solidus-yellow and green. Observed object for 5 to 10 minutes
miles distant, moving at a tremendous speed from east to west. Direction
of flight was west to southwest. Object was in sight from 5 to 10
seconds. Object was described as being three times the brilliance
of a meteorite. Weather was clear, ceiling and visibility unlimited.
Complete report on certain data due to unwarranted, then official
Objects furnished to I.O. by Fourth Army and a copy is retained in
the files of D. O. No. 10.

11. This same object was also observed from the rear of the
the size of the Camp Hood Officers' Club. Observer could not estimate
rear of the Camp Hood, but stated it was round with a tail. Color
described from front to rear as brilliant green, red, dark red, purple,
with dark outline. Object was in sky approximately 30 seconds,
during which time it covered one-half mile in east to west direction
being rounded. This observer majored in Petrol and Geological
subjects at University of Oklahoma, and stated he definitely believed
object sighted was not a meteorite, and judging by the color of its
trail, observer believed object was consuming a fuel of hydro-carbon
base. Copy of report has been furnished to AMC, and a copy is re-
tained in the files of D. O. No. 10.

12. On 7 July 1949, 106th District OSIT was advised by ****
****2-Section, Headquarters Fourth Army, that a request
had been directed through channels for the assistance of a Technical
Intelligence Team from Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, in
determining the nature of the aerial phenomena in the vicinity of Camp
Hood, Texas.
