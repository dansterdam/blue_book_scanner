The image shows a blurry, grainy black and white photograph that appears to be of a cloudy or hazy sky, possibly during nighttime due to the darkness of the scene. It's difficult to discern details, but there seem to be lighter patches or possibly illuminated areas in the cloud cover. No distinct shapes or objects are clearly identifiable as UFOs or other specific phenomena. The quality of the photograph is poor, which adds to the ambiguity of the content.

As for the text above the photograph, it's very faint and not all is legible, but here's what can be made out:

To the right, there seems to be some handwriting that reads "Astro (Meteor?)" suggesting that someone might have speculated that the phenomenon might be astronomical in nature, potentially a meteor. Please note that due to the poor quality of the document, many details cannot be confidently made out, and the text provided is to the best of my ability to decipher what's visible.

Santa Fe New Mexican Tuesday, February 22, 1949

FRANKFURT, Feb. 22

Four mysterious projectiles—apparently rocket or jet-propelled—have
landed in the U. S. zone of Germany since October, 1946, American authorities reported today.

The last one shot over the northeastern corner of the State of Bavaria
last Jan. 31 and American technical experts have obtained fragments of it
but their investigations have left them mystified as to the origin of
the missiles.

American officials explained that all four landed in the same general
area, just east of Schweinfurt, some 35 miles from the Russian zone.

The experts said they were mystified because if the projectiles were
fired from the Russian zone they possessed almost uncanny accuracy since
all four landed in so small an area.

They also explained that a missile traveling 35 miles from eastern Germany should have dug a larger crater, even if loaded with only ordinary
charges.

The first missile was reported in October, 1946, according to German
police records quoted by American authorities.

Two others followed in May and July, 1947.

The fourth arrived between 4 and 5 a.m. last Jan. 31.

A German policeman who saw its flaming tail streak through the early
morning sky and then plunge into the earth said it traveled from northeast to southwest, coming from the direction of Russian-occupied territory.

It tore a hole seven feet wide and 10 inches deep in the ground and had
a flaming tail 20 feet long, authorities said.

Officials said they doubted it could have been released from an airplane
because the eyewitness said that he had heard no sound from a plane before the missile landed.

Thus far the experts have not been able to reconstruct the missile because they possess only a few fragments. They have not been able to determine what powered it because the fragments were rainsodden when picked up.

SOVIET ROCKET
Found In U. S. Zone.

Army Makes Little Of Incident,
Saying Nothing Unusual Is
Found In Construction

      Berline, Feb. 12--(AP)--A Russian
rocket, fired into a sparsely inhabited
part in the American Zone of Germany
sometime ago, but caused no dam-
age or casualties, U.S.' authorities
disclosed today.

  The incident was kept secret until
now, and details will remain secret
and the incident would be explained
the officials said. They expressed be-
lief they felt no purpose would have
been served by an earlier annouce-
ment.

  A high army official said there
was nothing unusual in construc-
tion of the rocket. It carried a lot
similar-than-usual charge of ex-
plosive, as customary in maneu-
vers. It dug a crater about a foot
deep in an isolated area near the
boundary of the Soviet Zone.

  The Soviet Army engaged in ma-
neuvers last fall, and possibly the
rocket was fired then. An airlift
pilot said in November he had seen
Russian tanks firing guns that
seemed of an unusual type, and
which he thought were anti-aircraft
weapons,.

  This is the only known instance
of a Russian rocket falling into the
American zone, German reports of
other instances never have been
substantiated.

The text is an article discussing a Soviet rocket found in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany after World War II. The details are incomplete as parts of the text are cut off from the view. The date at the top suggests the article is from February 15, 1949. The word "Dubonnet" can also be seen at the bottom. It appears to be an advertisement unrelated to the article above.
