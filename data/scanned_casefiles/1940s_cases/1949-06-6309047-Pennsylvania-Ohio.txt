1125 Cornwall Ave  
Bethlehem,  
June 22, 1950  

Dr. L. Levitt 
Fels Planetarium 
20th; Parkway 
Philadelphia 5, Pa.

Dear Dr. Levitt:

Mrs. Esther E. King of Aldin Farms [unclear] tells me that
she has been in touch with the Planetarium and that you 
would like to have a report of what I saw in the heavens 
shortly after midnight Saturday, June 25.  

As I were sitting on the steps in front of my home at 
1125 Cornwall Ave (Leban) and facing northwest, I 
saw the brilliant object--so brilliantly brilliant and so west, 
as we gazed, my attention was suddenly caught by a halo or 
flare, sweeping across the western sky. It moved from the 
north, then a south, in a line slanting earthward, not so 
rapidly as a shooting star, but at a speed that gave me 4 or 
5 or 6 seconds to observe it before it dropped behind a tree. 
It looked to me a very bright flaming ball, red-gold in color, 
turning in its own-made A ray path which gradually 
dimpled and smoothed until it ignored away. The ball of 
fire did not appear to be as high in the sky as was the 
lights of a plane that shortly, afterwards passed overhead. 
The exact occurrence and the display which took place less than 
10 minutes after midnight.

Sincerely yours,

A TRUE COPY:

'File 21-25
of 26 October 1949, he stated that he and his wife were present with Mr.
and Mrs. _____________________ at their home in Media, Pa., sitting outdoors when the
fireball appeared. Although not familiar with astronomical phenomena,
______________________ classified the object as a fireball. It was seen for
approximately four (4) to five (5) seconds and appeared to be, in size,
about equal to a full moon seen at the Zenith and not at the horizon. It
was very bright being slightly green in color; moving very fast; appearing
to follow a curved course; giving off smaller pieces of light in the same
manner as a sky rocket. The ridge of the house obstructed the view making
it impossible to see whether or not the object retained its brilliancy
until it struck the earth. The object distinctly lit up the country side
and _____________________ recalled that there was any sound whatsoever. Mr.____________________
stated he would guess the object was probably fifty (50) miles away. This
letter is being retained in files of 3d District CSI.

I,
                                    October 2l, 1949

----------------------- of ----, Pennsylvania, prior to malking th-
affidavit contained in the following paragraphs, has been aavised b,., an
Z. TOWNSTRP. who has identified himself to mo as a special agent. Office of
Special Investigations, USAF, that I do not have to make any statement and that
any statement I may male mzy be used against me in a court of law. I have
also been informed of my right to have an attorney. All such understandings.
I make the following statement of my own free will and accord, and no threat
or fear of punishment and without inducement and promist or hint of reward.

On the night of 26 June, 1949, at approximatel-y 2000 hours, I sighted what
appeared to be a "brilliant and exceptionally large meteor". I was seated on
the lawn of my friends, Mr. ---- whose home my wife and I
were visiting, and was looking toward the northeastern sky. There was no
clouds and visibility was goed. This item is within 20 feet of the Tioga
Reservoir belonging to the Philadelphia Suburban Water Company, and southeast
of the Puchess House. It isi about 20 feet above the reservoir.

The object appeared as a blue-green "moon" and was, I would etimate, between
1/2 and 2/3 of the size of the, diameter of the moon. It appeard 2 degrees
below the star Altair in the head of the handle of the Rig Dipper, facing
the usual fireball, it did soim to streak, or light steadily growin
brighter, but at the full size. There was no question of any confusion with
the moon or a planet, as it was many times larger than any planet, and as,
of course, the moon or a planet could not be in this direction.

The object moved in a southerly direction through about 20 degree of arch in 
3 to 3 1/2 seconds, and disappeared behind the roof of the Furges house. It
was also seen by Mrs. ---- who locked arount, on
to a bluish green glow above the hill, but my wife, who locked the othr way,
saw no such trail.

Unlike the usual fireball, the appearance was not accompanied by a hissing
sound nor was it followed by any thunder sounds. It was not folloved by any
lighted trail.

As to its acutal size, height or speed, I can make no statement, as of couve,
any one of these factors would be dependent on the other. As noted aove,
its diameter was about 1/2" of arc and it moth through aboit 20 degrees of
arc in 3 to 3 1/2 seconds. Calculating very roughly, if it was 50 miles
away, the altitude would be about 20 miles and the speed aobur 7 miles a second;
if the distance was greater, both altitude and speed would also be greater,
and the revernse would apply if it was neaner. It was about 30 degrees above
the horizon when it appered and about 15 degrees when it disapeared behind
the house.

As noted above, it was a circular disc and there was no sian of any exhaust.
I have never previouly seen a large fireball and was somewhat surprised that
it was not blinding, but gave out a little less light than the full moon.

                                                [Signature block redacted]

Its path was entirely regular, with no chance of course or speed. There was
no variation in the amount of light or any "blinking", no rotation could
have been observed as no features of the disc were visible.

Mr.P. thought he saw it leave behind some red sparks, but neither Mrs.
Purves or I saw these.

My friend, Mrs. A and some guests, from their lawn at
Conshohocken, ten miles north of Media, at about the same time of the night,
saw what "was undoubtedly the same object, traveling, they think, from northwest
to southeast. They at first thought it was a rocket and then realized that it
was a meteor.

I reported the sighting promptly to The Franklin Institute, who furnished an
account which was published in three late edition of the Sunday Bulletin on 26 
June, 1949. The following day I wrote to Dr. of the University of
Pennsylvania Flower Observatory at Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, and gave them a
detailed account of the phenomenon. I sent copies of this letter to Dr.
Lincoln LaPaz, Director of the Institute of Meteoritics, University of New
Mexico, Los Alamos, New Mexico, and also to Dr. Frederick C. Leonard, Astronomer,
University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.

Dr. Oliver is President of the American Meteor Society and as such collects
accounts of all meteors. He tells me that he has not obtained enough other
accounts to enable him to trace the actual course of the object by triangulation.
Dr. LaPaz wrote me a series of questions about the phenomenon, which I have
answered, and I understand that the Office of Special Investigations, USAF, has
a copy of this answer.

I have read this statement, which consists of two pages. I have signed this
statement and initialed all corrections. This statement is the truth to the
best of my knowledge and belief, and I have given it freely and voluntarily.

Dear Sir:

I am sending you my observations of what appeared to be a 
meteor of a very bright intensity which I observed while sitting
in my back yard on Sat. night. The time was approximately
midnight. The duration of visibility for me was very short,
probably no more than 2 to 3 seconds as it disappeared from view
behind a house to the west of me. The color was a bright blue
and the intensity was enough to light up the area around us
as if a Fourth of July rocket had gone off several hundred feet
in the air. The duration of fall - it seemed to come from the
area in the vicinity of the handle of the Big Dipper and fall
to the southwest. I was facing north and when it disappeared
from my view it was almost straight northwest of me. The
angle seemed to be a perfect circle.

                                   N

                                   [----ed out text---]

I hope my very amateur observations may be of some help
to you.

                                               Respectfully yours,

Dear Dr. Hynek:

Confirming our phone conversation, here is my impression
of the meteors seen on the night of June 27.

I am not sure of the time, but it was around 12:30. The
meteors looked unusually large and unusually bright - at
least as bright as the full moon. I saw it in the western sky -
perhaps a little south of the west. There were times at intervals,
its horizontal direction was not from sight to left but from
northwest to northeast.

I saw it through trees and can not tell the length of
its visible travel. It was visible to me for perhaps a second
to a half.

Physically it was large primarily, while with a rather
short thick tail that had distinct blue color. A sort of
parallel tail, thinner, was definitely red and yellow.

I would say that its angle with the horizon was about 15°.

I would be interested in hearing if it landed and has been
discovered.

                              Sincerely,
