SUMMARY: (Under each numbered report. Give significant facts in sequence paragraph. List enclosures at lower left. Build this report of AF Form 112—Part III)

At 2000 hours on 8 Aug 49, at Biloxi, Mississippi, an unidentified object was
sighted in the sky by 1st Lt [name redacted] of Keesler AFB, Miss. The object
sighted appeared to be in the shape of a large beach ball about two (2) feet in di-
ameter. The object was a bright yellow in color with a faint glow around it as though
seen through a mist, as the moon appears when seen through a thin fog. It was trav-
eling at a speed estimated at from 600 to 800 mph. The object was at an altitude of
approximately 1,000 feet and was below the clouds and in the clear (VFR). The obser-
ver could distinguish no definite sounds coming from the object because of the sounds
of local traffic and aircraft flying local in from Keesler AFB (Four B-25s and one C-47).
The object disappeared after being in sight for only about twenty (20) seconds, 
it just seemed to blink out and was gone. There was no exhaust visible. No distin-
guishing features were noted.

The sighting of this object took place only seventeen (17) hours after a similar
object was reported being seen hurtling across New Orleans, Louisiana.

SYNOPSIS On 8 August 1949, at 2030 hours, Mr. [blank], of Hattiesburg, Missippi[sic], observed from the front porch of his home at [blank] Street, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, an unidentified object traveling through the sky at a great rate of speed. Mr. [blank] described the object as sphere shaped with a very soft yellowish glowing light approximately the size of a common soft ball. This object remained in sight for approximately one second and moved from sight by passing behind trees.

On 8 August 1949, 2030 hours, Mr. [blank] observed an object traveling across the sky at a speed which Mr. [blank] described as being "faster than any jet plane that I have ever seen." This object was circular in shape and tapered to an almost fine point. The entire object was luminous. The foremost portion gave off an extremely yellowish glow and the tapering end faded into a bluish color. This object remained in sight for approximately one second.
