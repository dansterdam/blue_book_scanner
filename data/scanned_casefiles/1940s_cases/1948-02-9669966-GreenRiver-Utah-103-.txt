7 SCIENTIFIC value of meteorite pieces caused residents of Norton County to submit even ordinary rocks for examination.

In Jennings, tiny Crest, midway between those two towns and northwest of the farm, a small station that until recently was listed in the official railroad guidebooks as the geographical center of the United States, the excitement was more subdued. Farmers living in the vicinity of the places where the stones fell had the experience of being able to get into the act without going any great distance from their own back door.
There was little or nada of the treasure hunting spirit that characterized past spectacular meteorite showers—the famed golden meteor of 100 years ago that produced a near riot in a Connecticut village, or the stony rain that struck Iowa in the early '90s. That was the old days, of course, but there seems to have been a rather unique limiting factor in the case

Incident #101 — Norton, Kansas — 18 February 1948

     This now-celebrated case of an unusual fireball has
been adequately reported in astronomical literature; (for de-
tails, see Sky and Telescope, April, 1948, page 154, and Octo-
ber, 1948, page 293). Positive identification has been made
by the recovery of fragments. The origin of this object is,
therefore, definitively astronomical, and the incident need not
be considered further.

NORTON METEORITE
(Continued from page 21)

Shortly before 6:00 P. M., on February 18, an account of the Norton Incident reached the Institute of Meteoritics of the University of New Mexico through Lt. R. E. Young of the Kirtland Field Civil Air Patrol office. In the next few hours additional information was secured through C.A.P. channels and long-distance calls. Then, a huge volume of correspondence was carried on with observatories over the farrier variances and rural areas. Extensiveness well into Kansas by Institute of Meteoritics representatives, to obtain transit measurements of the position of various points on the meteor path as seen by them.

Fragment of Meteorite Found
As soon as decent weather permitted full-scale field search, an Institute of Meteoritics party entered the area in which observers' lines of sight into the end point of the meteor's path intersected. On April 28, they found fragments of the meteorite seen in the party's path, George W. Tatsell, almost the first farrier investigating in the intersection area, Mr. Tansill had picked up this fragment on April 6 and being familiar with the rocks of the area, knew at once that it was foreign to the region. However, he had to wait until the arrival of the Institute of Meteoritics party to have his surmise that it was a meteorite confirmed. Further search resulted in the discovery... several hundred additional meteorites of very... size. Still later, a mass weighing over 100 pounds was found by Ralph Dewey Bestert and Mr. Haskell Miklich, developer and in areas already searched by the Institute of Meteoritics party.

These discoveries and the laboratory examination of the materials recovered showed that the "Norton Incident" resulted not from the explosion of a rocket, guided missile, or satellite vehicle, but solely from the fall of a meteorite. Further, the Norton County meteorite, as scientists labeled it, was of an extremely rare and interesting type.

Three Main Groups
Meteorites, the very occurrence of which was denied even by scientists only a little over a century ago, are now known to be classifiable into three main groups. Science has been recognized as irons. These resemble closely fragments of a nickel-iron core such as the earth is believed to possess; Another group is the irons of the intermediate zone of... hardened rock. Presumed solids silicates mixed with nickel-iron, thought to resemble the core of the earth...

Later, they crystallize in numerous small structure fragments of that portion of...

theory of the origin of the solar system, like all such theories that have gained any measure of acceptance, one visits birth to planets swung in the same direction around the sun! Considering the kinetic energies involved in the impact between a meteorite-planet moving in a nearly circular orbit and another planet traveling in the same direction about the sun but following a more eccentric orbit intersecting the first. It is easy to see that a head-on collision of these bodies is not required in order to bring about their fragmentation or even their partial vaporization.

Granting that some sort of collision between planets resulted in the Norton County meteorite "parent," the disruption of the parentive planet, one-time within the last billion years or so since therein free hitting of each evolved between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

18 March 19U8

INTERVIEWS WITH MR. OSCAR E. MONNIG
Secretary, National Meteoritical Society

1. On 13 March 19U9, while on a navigational training flight to Ft. 
Worth, Texas, Major Edwin W. Foulk interviewed Mr. Oscar E. Monnig. Mr.
Monnig is Secretary of the National Meteoritical Society. He has been ac-
tively engaged, as an amateur, in research on and the collection of meteorites
since 1YU3, and hence is regarded as an expert on the subject.

2. Mr. Monnig quoted two other authorities on the subject. Their names
and addresses are:

a. Professor H. H. Nininger
Box 11171
Winslow, Arizona

b. Dr. F. A. Whipple
University of Iowa
Iowa City, Iowa

3. Major Foulk queried Mr. Monnig specifically on the explosion of a
supposed meteoroid at 1705 CST, 13 February 19U9. It was stated that this
phenomenon was definitely that of a meteoroid, or daytime fireball. The
most convincing evidence of this is a photograph taken of the dust cloud
left by this fireball. The photograph was taken from a point 5 miles north
of Morton, Texas by Duane E. Grey of Norton, Kansas. Mr. Grey has sold the
copyright to this photograph to Nesmith Service, Inc., 12606 Third Street,
Cleveland 13, Ohio. Mr. Monnig said during the flight of a meteorite outside
the atmosphere of the earth, it is believed that, as a black body, it achieves
a temperature of about 40C0. Upon reaching the air layer of the earth, it be-
comes friction-heated and is subjected to increasing pressure; this causes a
release of a trail of gases which usually explode at an altitude of about
20 miles above the earth. After the explosion, a visible dust cloud remains
in the atmosphere. The meteorite now usually consists of a cluster of small
stones which continue on to strike the earth. Their pattern of impact de-
pends upon the inclination of their flight path with the earth's surface, and
varies from slightly oval to an elongated ellipse. If this flight path is
observed, the point of impact is calculated, and interested parties, such as
Mr. Monnig, make a search for the particles. The particles, when found, usu-
ally resemble small stones and are composed chiefly of silicate mass. There may 
be a burned shell surrounding the particles, usually about 2 to 1U mm. thick.
Weights are ordinarily of the order of a few ounces.

4. Final evidence that this 13 February incident was a fireball will by
the discovery of meteoritic particles. The discovery will probably be re-
ported by Professor Nininger, since the meteorite is calculated to have fallen
in his "territory". It is a matter of chance among meteoritical enthusiasts.. 
that they do not poach on areas already canvassed by another collector. Dis-
covery may occur very soon, or it may he as long as 12 months before any par-
ticles are found.

5. Mr. Morning exhibited a series of four photographs taken of a meteorite 
dust cloud or "train" taken on 20 May 1944 by Cpl. A. L. Aenis, ASN 37307171,
c/o Photo Section, PAAF, Pampa, Texas. The present address of the corporal is 
unknown, but his photographs are copyrighted. A portion of them and other 
photographs of similar nature would be valuable for slide or other 
comparative purposes. Mr. Morning requested that if the copyright owner of these
photographs is located, he be informed so that he may obtain additional copies.

6. Mr. Morning quoted the book, "The Book of the Damned" by Charles Fort 
as an interesting collection of unexplained aerial phenomena. He said that 
these incidents are authentic, but Mr. Fort's conclusions and interpretations 
are fantastic.

7. Mr. Morning said that he will keep this office informed or his opinions 
on any future sightings of aerial phenomena that come to his knowledge.

The text appears to be part of an official report or correspondence, discussing the exhibition of certain photographs, reference to copyrighted material, and a mention of "The Book of the Damned" by Charles Fort. The signature and name of Major Marvin W. McCard, USAF, are also included at the bottom of the document.

The photograph present in the document appears to show a series of trails or lines in the sky, which may be consistent with a meteor's vapor trail as described in the text. The image is monochrome and rather faint. It seems to depict several nearly vertical lines diverging from a common point at the bottom of the image, suggesting an explosion or burst in the sky.

Now, as per your request, I will transcribe the text from the document:

of February 12 over Northern Kansas was just that, a meteor. No fragments
have been recovered from it. There were found, beginning April 21, over
several small fragments up to one of 4 1/2 pounds. Then a buried
spot in a clover field led to the digging up of a piece of some 100 pounds
embedded about two feet in the soil. The stone is what is termed as an
"achondrite", a technical name for an unusual type of stony meteorite.
It is reported to be of a type which will deteriorate rapidly.

A photograph of the trail of the meteor, made by amateur photographer
Duane E. Korey of Norton, shows the vapor trail left in the sky by the
explosion of a meteor which was seen in Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado,
Kansas, and Nebraska. It was made at Korey's home, nine miles north of
Norton, just four minutes after the meteor exploded. A smudge of blue-
white smoke remained in the sky for an hour February 18th. This photo-
graph is in file under Incident #101.

Further remarks are contained in supplement.

INTERVIEW WITH MR. OSCAR E. MONNIG
Secretary, National Meteoritical Society

1. On 13 March 1948, while on a navigational training flight to Ft. Worth, Texas, Major Melvin W. Faulk interviewed Mr. Oscar E. Monnig. Mr. Monnig is Secretary of the National Meteoritical Society. He has been actively engaged, as an amateur, in research on and the collection of meteorites since 1930, and hence is regarded as an expert on the subject.

2. Mr. Monnig quoted two other authorities on the subject. Their names and addresses are:

    a. Professor H. H. Nininger
       P.O. Box 1171
       Winslow, Arizona

    b. Dr. C. C. Wylie
       University of Iowa
       Iowa City, Iowa

3. Major Faulk queried Mr. Monnig specifically on the explosion of a supposed meteorite at 1705 CST, 13 February 1948. It was stated that this phenomenon was definitely that of a meteorite, or daylight fireball. The most conclusive evidence of this is a photograph taken of the dust cloud left by the fireball. This photograph was taken from a point 3 miles north of Moran, Kansas by Duane E. Priebe of Norton, Kansas. Mr. Priebe said that, the daylight to this photograph is deliberate, right at 1700. It is advised to contact this photographer to it said during the explosion of a meteorite outside the atmosphere of the earth, that is between say, that is, at a black body, at achieving a temperature of about 450C. Upon reaching the air layer of this earth, it becomes a triple-heated and is subjected to increasing pressure; this causes a release of a trail of gases which usually explode at an altitude of about 20 miles above the earth. After the explosion, a visible dust cloud remains in the atmosphere. The meteorite now usually consists of a cluster of small stones which continue on to strike the earth. Their pattern of impact de-pends upon the inclination of their flight path with the earth's surface, and varies from a slightly oval to an elongated ellipse. It is felt that the path is observed, the point of impact is calculated, and interested parties, such as planetarians, make a search for the particles. The particles, when found, usually resemble small stones and are composed chiefly of silicates, some may be a fused shell surrounding the particles, usually about a 1 to 3 mm. thick, which is an ordinary of chiding or a few ounces.

Final evidence that the 13 February incident was a fireball will be the discovery of meteoritic particles. The discovery will probably will be confirmed by Professor Nininger, since the trail it was calculated to have fallen generally near soap-spring, Arizona an advantageous local. The particles may not occur very soon, or it may be as long as 12 months before any particles are found.

Commanding General

Attn: Maj. M. W. Faulk (WIAA)

Dear Sir:

While there was never any doubt in my mind, I can now report to you finally that there is tangible proof that the fireball of Feb. 13 over Northern Kansas was just that, inasmuch as meteorites have been recovered from it.

These were found beginning Apr 24. First several smaller fragments up to 1/2-1/2 pounds came to light. Then a distributed not in a clover field lad to the digging up of a piece of some 100 pounds about two feet in the soil.

You can get details from the preliminary reports I forwarded you to before. Also Prof. H. H. Nininger made the normal initial survey, Dr. L. La Paz came in later and got most of the thing wrapped up and agreed to, and Bowen wrote of their of them for details or confirmation. To date, Von could well answer secondarily, a technical curve for curve the type is listed as 12. It is reported to be of a type which will deteriorate rapidly, of heavy meteorite, some sand many of its own.

Incidentally, when we talked together you may recall that I asked you whether you could help me locate a former Cnb. Al Norris. Trouble yourself no further, as I found him by inquiry thru ordinary channels.

Now I'll seek you error favor. In some possible work in area containing iron meteorites, I could use a metal detector weekly. I have been checking into the types of units the Army had left and sadly, I am told that they had two AN/PRS-2, and a tweezed 3 out. Halfway the same, confused that these are nice detectors, we could that there will be information on these (instructions, etc.), and who helps on it that other semi available? I have located two surplus outfits who sell these, but am wondering if the Army or the War Assets has any more.

Sincerely,
Oscar Monnig

STATEMENT:
In compliance with instructions given me by Captain [redacted], I wish to report the following incident. This report is not to be construed as giving my personal opinion as to the possibility of the existence of interplanetary space ships, nor do I wish to appear as a "crackpot." I would not have given the information voluntarily. However, when asked the questions concerning the UFO's by Captain [redacted], my reply was that there had been many pilots who believed in interplanetary ships. I further stated that these same pilots do not wish to make their names public for obvious reasons. I further stated, that these statements by this (sic) pilots were always off the record, and I could not divulge my informants. The following is my statement:

1. [redacted]: I personally saw a flying object on March 8, 1950 at [redacted], England, about 01710 pm. This was a very clear day with no clouds around. A silvery object was observed through binoculars, and it was observed by the entire crew of the [redacted], of which I was a member. The object remained stationary for approximately five minutes and then suddenly disappeared at a very high rate of speed.

2. [redacted]: During the period of [redacted], England by [redacted] stationed at [redacted] AFB, NH, on [redacted], we all observed an unidentifiable object for a period in excess of three hours. This object was multi-colored and hovered, changing colors and noise powered, with no evidence of any physical evidence on earth putting it in a category of UFO.

SUBJECT: Analysis includes phenomena

1. No assigned incidents have been received to date.

2. Based on the most recent fragmentary reports of December 6, 1950 at  
   1114 hours, on the 9th at the Landingham school of Gunnison, Colorado 
   County, even the incident, i.e., six (6) objects oval in shape,
   approximately ten to twelve feet in diameter and emitting a bright 
   white flash, is in itself insufficient in terms of factual 
   incident value in view of atmospheric photographs described in the accompanying technical 
   report of film which does not cover the experience of the personnel during 
   the non-reporting period to date.

3. The fragmentary flash of March 6 west of municipal terminals,
   revealing two (2) phosphorescent phosphorescent tail of light, February 18 at 
   Gatlin and Timmons, Texas which other fragmentary incidents have yielded 
   nothing in the quantity of type of the residue of contray to obscure the 
   trail of light which was seen in a scattered array and what appeared to be 
   metallic but non-reflective disk object moving in an erratic and 
   uneven pattern and is not in the category of an ideally reproduced 
   type. Comment is reserved to fulfill a subsequent report that is considered 
   credible and significant within the categories being forwarded, but  
   indicating no major incident in the analysis period. Further, an unaccompanied 
   tail, while very low level was quite fragmentary since it seems a normal 
   earth-to-air fall in contrast to any true airborne object against a normal 
   night sky of stars. In ample, there's a degree of kinship or credibility to the fall to the earth. Nevertheless, by means of the usual slips and
   reports of the phenomenon, six and (a) December to date suggest minima measure 
   as to an origin since no specific object, readily relating in the earth's 
   air field, i.e., in the two southern points, has been without a recurrence as of 
   the efforts at meteoritic impact on the earth has been ferreted.

A review of the very puzzling nature of the major incidents,
   discovered when sent back through mail and more instances of similar 
   nature, in which to recall the representation of a large number of flat 
   pancake and three-dimensional patterns, in that no matter how to secure 
   these forms invariably they emerge with true, three-dimensional 
   segmenting patterns. Nevertheless, the concentrated attention should 
   be once established the hypothesis of substances in the frozen gases (upon 
   exposure to impact) or just the chance. Cc: Major USAF, 4602AISS/Opns, Photo

4. White or several slightly long metallic and less photographs of such

   apparent resignation [that] photographic approach has failed to 
   confirm the sustained hypothesis of aerodynamic forces evident in enclosed 
   normal reaction to gravity, etc.

   The meteoric hypotheses predicated on the activity of the tail 
   or the surface phenomenon of capturing or the earth's atmos will be traced 
   back to that old theme of world impact or even, if you will, of earthly origin.

The image provided appears to be a scanned page from an old document and contains a number of illustrations and textual information. The illustrations depict a chart of "Space Explored and Space Unexplored" from Science Illustrated; however, due to the image's blurriness and the text's small size, I cannot transcribe the small text reliably. The main visible text and elements are as follows:

- Illustrations of a spectrum with wavelengths labeled in kilometers and a scale indicating distance from Earth to space in miles.
- Text and labels such as "12,500 MILES", "6,000 MILES", and "SPECTRUM" next to the waves and scale illustrations.
- An illustration of a "NAZI SPACE SHIP" with the text explaining it's supposed to reach the Earth at 3,500-mile range.
- Gravity effects on man in space, stating "GRAVITY pull on man's body decreases in space. 4 5/8 lbs." with a smaller note of "57 lbs."
- A meteorite illustration with a caption about its mass and potential impact speed.
- A description of "TEMPERATURE of space is unknown quantity, may be as high as to destroy anything passing through."
- Title of a section is present as "Science Illustrated chart of Space Explored and Space Unexplored." Below that title is a paragraph too small to read due to the image quality.

Unfortunately, the bottom part of the page is obscured by another page laying over it, and the small text is indistinct, preventing accurate transcription of that section. The document's graphic style and content suggest it is from a period when space exploration was in its earlier stages and reflects the speculative nature of knowledge at that time. It contains visual elements that appear to be more educational or conceptual rather than photographs of actual phenomena or objects.

The image provided is not a photograph; it is a diagram that appears to describe various altitudes and experiments related to aeronautics and space exploration. The diagram contains drawings of rockets, an airplane, and other measurement devices against a backdrop that seems to represent the Earth's atmosphere and outer space.

Here is all the text found in the document:

small rockets as pilot
ones at high altitudes.

V-2 ROCKETS have made
almost 40 trips, some over
100 miles up, as part of
current space research.
