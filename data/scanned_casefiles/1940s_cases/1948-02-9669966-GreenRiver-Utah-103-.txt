The text is a combination of administrative document references, with mention of "Project Blue Book," which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. The document appears to be discussing the forwarding of a report and mentions a "Colonel, USAF," possibly as the author or relevant authority. The document's classification status is noted as well, with references to declassification directives and timelines.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects
TO: Director of Intelligence
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

1. Statement of Mr. [redacted], 1004 North Utah Avenue, Arlington 2, Virginia, a member of
NIACAP. Mr. [redacted] called Captain [redacted], Community Relations Division, OI, and gave the Captain the following information which is to be passed to the Air Defense Command, for their information, and is recorded as follows, the recorded statement of Mr. [redacted]:

STATEMENT:
In compliance with instructions given me by Captain [redacted], I wish to report the following incident. This report is not to be construed as giving my personal opinion as to the possibility of the existence of interplanetary space ships, nor do I wish to appear as a "crackpot." I would not have given the information voluntarily. However, when asked the questions concerning the UFO's by Captain [redacted], my reply was that there had been many pilots who believed in interplanetary ships. I further stated that these same pilots do not wish to make their names public for obvious reasons. I further stated, that these statements by this (sic) pilots were always off the record, and I could not divulge my informants. The following is my statement:

1. [redacted]: I personally saw a flying object on March 8, 1950 at [redacted], England, about 01710 pm. This was a very clear day with no clouds around. A silvery object was observed through binoculars, and it was observed by the entire crew of the [redacted], of which I was a member. The object remained stationary for approximately five minutes and then suddenly disappeared at a very high rate of speed.

2. [redacted]: During the period of [redacted], England by [redacted] stationed at [redacted] AFB, NH, on [redacted], we all observed an unidentifiable object for a period in excess of three hours. This object was multi-colored and hovered, changing colors and noise powered, with no evidence of any physical evidence on earth putting it in a category of UFO.

HEADQUARTERS 4602d AIR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SQUADRON (1)
APO 969 c/o PM, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF.

SUBJECT: Analysis includes phenomena

1. No assigned incidents have been received to date.

2. Based on the most recent fragmentary reports of December 6, 1950 at  
   1114 hours, on the 9th at the Landingham school of Gunnison, Colorado 
   County, even the incident, i.e., six (6) objects oval in shape,
   approximately ten to twelve feet in diameter and emitting a bright 
   white flash, is in itself insufficient in terms of factual 
   incident value in view of atmospheric photographs described in the accompanying technical 
   report of film which does not cover the experience of the personnel during 
   the non-reporting period to date.

3. The fragmentary flash of March 6 west of municipal terminals,
   revealing two (2) phosphorescent phosphorescent tail of light, February 18 at 
   Gatlin and Timmons, Texas which other fragmentary incidents have yielded 
   nothing in the quantity of type of the residue of contray to obscure the 
   trail of light which was seen in a scattered array and what appeared to be 
   metallic but non-reflective disk object moving in an erratic and 
   uneven pattern and is not in the category of an ideally reproduced 
   type. Comment is reserved to fulfill a subsequent report that is considered 
   credible and significant within the categories being forwarded, but  
   indicating no major incident in the analysis period. Further, an unaccompanied 
   tail, while very low level was quite fragmentary since it seems a normal 
   earth-to-air fall in contrast to any true airborne object against a normal 
   night sky of stars. In ample, there's a degree of kinship or credibility to the fall to the earth. Nevertheless, by means of the usual slips and
   reports of the phenomenon, six and (a) December to date suggest minima measure 
   as to an origin since no specific object, readily relating in the earth's 
   air field, i.e., in the two southern points, has been without a recurrence as of 
   the efforts at meteoritic impact on the earth has been ferreted.

A review of the very puzzling nature of the major incidents,
   discovered when sent back through mail and more instances of similar 
   nature, in which to recall the representation of a large number of flat 
   pancake and three-dimensional patterns, in that no matter how to secure 
   these forms invariably they emerge with true, three-dimensional 
   segmenting patterns. Nevertheless, the concentrated attention should 
   be once established the hypothesis of substances in the frozen gases (upon 
   exposure to impact) or just the chance. Cc: Major USAF, 4602AISS/Opns, Photo 
   sect. Thomson.

4. White or several slightly long metallic and less photographs of such 
   in near metaphysical profile with each of 8 hard and finely, respectively, 
   as once suggested some (weight) height of 2 feet, length 15 to 
   18 feet, saucer, rough nose, flattened wide force curve. There is an 
   apparent resignation [that] photographic approach has failed to 
   confirm the sustained hypothesis of aerodynamic forces evident in enclosed 
   normal reaction to gravity, etc.

   The meteoric hypotheses predicated on the activity of the tail 
   or the surface phenomenon of capturing or the earth's atmos will be traced 
   back to that old theme of world impact or even, if you will, of earthly origin.

The image provided appears to be a scanned page from an old document and contains a number of illustrations and textual information. The illustrations depict a chart of "Space Explored and Space Unexplored" from Science Illustrated; however, due to the image's blurriness and the text's small size, I cannot transcribe the small text reliably. The main visible text and elements are as follows:

- Illustrations of a spectrum with wavelengths labeled in kilometers and a scale indicating distance from Earth to space in miles.
- Text and labels such as "12,500 MILES", "6,000 MILES", and "SPECTRUM" next to the waves and scale illustrations.
- An illustration of a "NAZI SPACE SHIP" with the text explaining it's supposed to reach the Earth at 3,500-mile range.
- Gravity effects on man in space, stating "GRAVITY pull on man's body decreases in space. 4 5/8 lbs." with a smaller note of "57 lbs."
- A meteorite illustration with a caption about its mass and potential impact speed.
- A description of "TEMPERATURE of space is unknown quantity, may be as high as to destroy anything passing through."
- Title of a section is present as "Science Illustrated chart of Space Explored and Space Unexplored." Below that title is a paragraph too small to read due to the image quality.

Unfortunately, the bottom part of the page is obscured by another page laying over it, and the small text is indistinct, preventing accurate transcription of that section. The document's graphic style and content suggest it is from a period when space exploration was in its earlier stages and reflects the speculative nature of knowledge at that time. It contains visual elements that appear to be more educational or conceptual rather than photographs of actual phenomena or objects.

In Jennings, tiny Crest, midway between those two towns and northwest of the farm, a small station that until recently was listed in the official railroad guidebooks as the geographical center of the United States, the excitement was more subdued. Farmers living in the vicinity of the places where the stones fell had the experience of being able to get into the act without going any great distance from their own back door.
There was little or nada of the treasure hunting spirit that characterized past spectacular meteorite showers‚Äîthe famed golden meteor of 100 years ago that produced a near riot in a Connecticut village, or the stony rain that struck Iowa in the early '90s.

Incident #101 ‚Äî Norton, Kansas ‚Äî 18 February 1948

     This now-celebrated case of an unusual fireball has
been adequately reported in astronomical literature; (for de-
tails, see Sky and Telescope, April, 1948, page 154, and Octo-
ber, 1948, page 293). Positive identification has been made
by the recovery of fragments. The origin of this object is,
therefore, definitively astronomical, and the incident need not
be considered further.

NORTON METEORITE
(Continued from page 21)

Shortly before 6:00 P. M., on February 18, an account of the Norton Incident reached the Institute of Meteoritics of the University of New Mexico through Lt. R. E. Young of the Kirtland Field Civil Air Patrol office. In the next few hours additional information was secured through C.A.P. channels and long-distance calls. Then, a huge volume of correspondence was carried on with observatories over the farrier variances and rural areas. Extensiveness well into Kansas by Institute of Meteoritics representatives, to obtain transit measurements of the position of various points on the meteor path as seen by them.

Fragment of Meteorite Found
As soon as decent weather permitted full-scale field search, an Institute of Meteoritics party entered the area in which observers' lines of sight into the end point of the meteor's path intersected. On April 28, they found fragments of the meteorite seen in the party's path, George W. Tatsell, almost the first farrier investigating in the intersection area, Mr. Tansill had picked up this fragment on April 6 and being familiar with the rocks of the area, knew at once that it was foreign to the region. However, he had to wait until the arrival of the Institute of Meteoritics party to have his surmise that it was a meteorite confirmed. Further search resulted in the discovery... several hundred additional meteorites of very... size. Still later, a mass weighing over 100 pounds was found by Ralph Dewey Bestert and Mr. Haskell Miklich, developer and in areas already searched by the Institute of Meteoritics party.

These discoveries and the laboratory examination of the materials recovered showed that the "Norton Incident" resulted not from the explosion of a rocket, guided missile, or satellite vehicle, but solely from the fall of a meteorite. Further, the Norton County meteorite, as scientists labeled it, was of an extremely rare and interesting type.

Three Main Groups
Meteorites, the very occurrence of which was denied even by scientists only a little over a century ago, are now known to be classifiable into three main groups. Science has been recognized as irons. These resemble closely fragments of a nickel-iron core such as the earth is believed to possess; Another group is the irons of the intermediate zone of... hardened rock. Presumed solids silicates mixed with nickel-iron, thought to resemble the core of the earth...

Later, they crystallize in numerous small structure fragments of that portion of...

NORTON METEORITE

Considering the kinetic energies involved in the impact between a meteorite-planet moving in a nearly circular orbit and another planet traveling in the same direction about the sun but following a more eccentric orbit intersecting the first. It is easy to see that a head-on collision of these bodies is not required in order to bring about their fragmentation or even their partial vaporization.

Granting that some sort of collision between planets resulted in the Norton County meteorite "parent," the disruption of the parentive planet, one-time within the last billion years or so since therein free hitting of each evolved between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. We can designate the place a little more precisely than the mist of birth because a great multiplicity of the Kansas meteorites' bigger brothers occur actually between discovered lining about the san line or path Mars and Jupiter.

18 March 19U8

INTERVIEWS WITH MR. OSCAR E. MONNIG
Secretary, National Meteoritical Society

1. On 13 March 19U9, while on a navigational training flight to Ft. 
Worth, Texas, Major Edwin W. Foulk interviewed Mr. Oscar E. Monnig. Mr.
Monnig is Secretary of the National Meteoritical Society. He has been ac-
tively engaged, as an amateur, in research on and the collection of meteorites
since 1YU3, and hence is regarded as an expert on the subject.

2. Mr. Monnig quoted two other authorities on the subject. Their names
and addresses are:

a. Professor H. H. Nininger
Box 11171
Winslow, Arizona

b. Dr. F. A. Whipple
University of Iowa
Iowa City, Iowa

3. Major Foulk queried Mr. Monnig specifically on the explosion of a
supposed meteoroid at 1705 CST, 13 February 19U9. It was stated that this
phenomenon was definitely that of a meteoroid, or daytime fireball. The
most convincing evidence of this is a photograph taken of the dust cloud
left by this fireball. The photograph was taken from a point 5 miles north
of Morton, Texas by Duane E. Grey of Norton, Kansas. Mr. Grey has sold the
copyright to this photograph to Nesmith Service, Inc., 12606 Third Street,
Cleveland 13, Ohio. Mr. Monnig said during the flight of a meteorite outside
the atmosphere of the earth, it is believed that, as a black body, it achieves
a temperature of about 40C0. Upon reaching the air layer of the earth, it be-
comes friction-heated and is subjected to increasing pressure; this causes a
release of a trail of gases which usually explode at an altitude of about
20 miles above the earth. After the explosion, a visible dust cloud remains
in the atmosphere. The meteorite now usually consists of a cluster of small
stones which continue on to strike the earth. Their pattern of impact de-
pends upon the inclination of their flight path with the earth's surface, and
varies from slightly oval to an elongated ellipse. If this flight path is
observed, the point of impact is calculated, and interested parties, such as
Mr. Monnig, make a search for the particles. The particles, when found, usu-
ally resemble small stones and are composed chiefly of silicate mass. There may 
be a burned shell surrounding the particles, usually about 2 to 1U mm. thick.
Weights are ordinarily of the order of a few ounces.

4. Final evidence that this 13 February incident was a fireball will by
the discovery of meteoritic particles. The discovery will probably be re-
ported by Professor Nininger, since the meteorite is calculated to have fallen
in his "territory". It is a matter of chance among meteoritical enthusiasts.. 
that they do not poach on areas already canvassed by another collector. Dis-
covery may occur very soon, or it may he as long as 12 months before any par-
ticles are found.

5. Mr. Morning exhibited a series of four photographs taken of a meteorite 
dust cloud or "train" taken on 20 May 1944 by Cpl. A. L. Aenis, ASN 37307171,
c/o Photo Section, PAAF, Pampa, Texas. The present address of the corporal is 
unknown, but his photographs are copyrighted. A portion of them and other 
photographs of similar nature would be valuable for slide or other 
comparative purposes. Mr. Morning requested that if the copyright owner of these
photographs is located, he be informed so that he may obtain additional copies.

6. Mr. Morning quoted the book, "The Book of the Damned" by Charles Fort 
as an interesting collection of unexplained aerial phenomena. He said that 
these incidents are authentic, but Mr. Fort's conclusions and interpretations 
are fantastic.

7. Mr. Morning said that he will keep this office informed or his opinions 
on any future sightings of aerial phenomena that come to his knowledge.

The photograph present in the document appears to show a series of trails or lines in the sky, which may be consistent with a meteor's vapor trail as described in the text. The image is monochrome and rather faint. It seems to depict several nearly vertical lines diverging from a common point at the bottom of the image, suggesting an explosion or burst in the sky.

Now, as per your request, I will transcribe the text from the document:

of February 12 over Northern Kansas was just that, a meteor. No fragments
have been recovered from it. There were found, beginning April 21, over
several small fragments up to one of 4 1/2 pounds. Then a buried
spot in a clover field led to the digging up of a piece of some 100 pounds
embedded about two feet in the soil. The stone is what is termed as an
"achondrite", a technical name for an unusual type of stony meteorite.
It is reported to be of a type which will deteriorate rapidly.

A photograph of the trail of the meteor, made by amateur photographer
Duane E. Korey of Norton, shows the vapor trail left in the sky by the
explosion of a meteor which was seen in Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado,
Kansas, and Nebraska. It was made at Korey's home, nine miles north of
Norton, just four minutes after the meteor exploded. A smudge of blue-
white smoke remained in the sky for an hour February 18th. This photo-
graph is in file under Incident #101.

noise was very high.

blown up then he noticed and ran in to see about it. Finding it O.K., he ran
outside to see what had exploded, saw the big cloud of smoke high overhead,

It was stated that this phenomenon was definitely that of a meteorite, or daylight fireball. The most conclusive evidence of this is a photograph taken of the dust cloud left by the fireball. This photograph was taken from a point 3 miles north of Moran, Kansas by Duane E. Priebe of Norton, Kansas. Mr. Priebe said that, the daylight to this photograph is deliberate, right at 1700. It is advised to contact this photographer to it said during the explosion of a meteorite outside the atmosphere of the earth, that is between say, that is, at a black body, at achieving a temperature of about 450C. Upon reaching the air layer of this earth, it becomes a triple-heated and is subjected to increasing pressure; this causes a release of a trail of gases which usually explode at an altitude of about 20 miles above the earth.

The particles, when found, usually resemble small stones and are composed chiefly of silicates, some may be a fused shell surrounding the particles, usually about a 1 to 3 mm. thick, which is an ordinary of chiding or a few ounces.

Final evidence that the 13 February incident was a fireball will be the discovery of meteoritic particles. The discovery will probably will be confirmed by Professor Nininger, since the trail it was calculated to have fallen generally near soap-spring, Arizona an advantageous local. The particles may not occur very soon, or it may be as long as 12 months before any particles are found.

Attn: Maj. M. W. Faulk (WIAA)

Dear Sir:

While there was never any doubt in my mind, I can now report to you finally that there is tangible proof that the fireball of Feb. 13 over Northern Kansas was just that, inasmuch as meteorites have been recovered from it.

These were found beginning Apr 24. First several smaller fragments up to 1/2-1/2 pounds came to light. Then a distributed not in a clover field lad to the digging up of a piece of some 100 pounds about two feet in the soil.

You can get details from the preliminary reports I forwarded you to before. Also Prof. H. H. Nininger made the normal initial survey, Dr. L. La Paz came in later and got most of the thing wrapped up and agreed to, and Bowen wrote of their of them for details or confirmation. To date, Von could well answer secondarily, a technical curve for curve the type is listed as 12. It is reported to be of a type which will deteriorate rapidly, of heavy meteorite, some sand many of its own.

Incidentally, when we talked together you may recall that I asked you whether you could help me locate a former Cnb. Al Norris. Trouble yourself no further, as I found him by inquiry thru ordinary channels.

Now I'll seek you error favor. In some possible work in area containing iron meteorites, I could use a metal detector weekly. I have been checking into the types of units the Army had left and sadly, I am told that they had two AN/PRS-2, and a tweezed 3 out. Halfway the same, confused that these are nice detectors, we could that there will be information on these (instructions, etc.), and who helps on it that other semi available? I have located two surplus outfits who sell these, but am wondering if the Army or the War Assets has any more.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Monnig:

      Reference is made to your letter of 16 May 1948 to Commanding General, Air Material Command, attention Major W. A. Faulk. Major Faulk has been transferred; however, the project on which he was working is a continuing one at this Headquarters.

      Enclosed are two technical manuals on the AN/APS-1 and SCR-625 Mine Detectors. No information is available at this Command as to where surplus equipment of this type may be obtained.

      It would be appreciated if you would continue to send any information of the type Major Faulk discussed with you to this Command, attention MCIA/b-3.

                                     Yours very truly,
                                     [Signature]

Dear Sir:

This Command is currently engaged in an intelligence study involving the identification of meteors and meteorites. Mr. Oscar E. Monnig, Secretary of the Texas Meteoritical Society, Fort Worth, Texas, has advised that you have taken a series or set of pictures of "tear-drop" tektites, and that you might possibly be able to furnish this headquarters with a set of these photographs.

I submit there is a likelihood that on June 21, 1947, something like a space-ship came here from the moon and upon February 21, 1948, returned to the moon.

This is of course speculation.

But has anyone yet explained the "flying discs" in terms of all the pretty-well proven facts in connection with them?

Has anyone yet devised a fuel powerful enough to kick a rocket from earth to the moon?

There have been hundreds of reports, during the past century, of observations which imply this world is visited from outside space. A string of contacts by these portentous visitors ending suddenly indicates chilling fear beyond ours, to the point where it would be in expedient for their numbers to have to do with us en-masse.

These reports have not been seriously considered by science, which in general ignores them.

However, according to Dr. Roes of Chamberlin Observatory, Denver, there is nothing in astronomy to explain the thing which exploded over Morehouse, Dr. Linking‚Äôs idea that the thing was a meteor flatly disregards Dr. Root's opinion, which may have been based on the Denver Post's statement that a Denver man saw the associate object twenty minutes before the explosion occurred.

I submit that the army needs men who are capable of recognizing the anomalies bodforementioned when they occur, even if only to aid in speculation regarding them.

The undersigned offers his services to that end, if the Army may wish to avail itself of them.

Excerpt of a letter dated April 11, 1949 from Dr. [Redacted], Director, Institute of Meteoritics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, to the Deputy Executive Director, Committee on Unorthodoxical [sic] Sciences, Research and Development Board:

Thank you for the surprising document sent me under date of March 20. As you remark, certain aspects of [Redacted] letters are fantastic (For example (1) the fireball procession of 1913, February 9, was certainly meteoric, although a rare type of chain fall; (2) no astronomer could take seriously [Redacted] "invasion by beings from Venus or the incon-' throaty" (3) he appears to lend best belief to the Air Force, upon untrustworthy evidence, of weapons of fission, fusion, high explosives attributed to the U. S. OSS [Redacted word to be researched] - nevertheless [Redacted] is justified in calling attention to certain instances of these phenomena (e.g. [Redacted] this field, himself (in the Green River instance, for example, his and [Redacted] evaluations of facts reported by observers on the ground, ground positions (not his balloon (in trouble)

As regards the Kansan, Kansas [Redacted] phenomenon, I remain convinced, also the Pow-Besse incident, it was a genuine meteoric fall, with one or exceptional things (again like the Pow-Besse fall). However, there are many curious aspects of both these falls, some of an objecting [sic] nature, like the familiar fact that in spite of intensive searches (admittedly under bad terrain and weather conditions), not a trace of meteoritic material has so far been [Redacted] nor in spite of intensive searches (ad-static voluble testimony given by Mr. [Redacted] Mrs. [Redacted], and the managers of the two cable lines, both to members of the staff of the University (Correllation of Kansas and to Institute of Meteoritics field survey parties. (See exhibits A, B and C enclosed).

Some comment on their testimony as appears in [Redacted] and C would seem desirable.

1. [Redacted] first reported the battery case as red hot. When I pointed out that the par on it was not charred, his account was changed to "too hot to handle". The Institute of Meteoritics party found only two men, not four, who saw the battery case fall. The battery case has been examined by Dr. [Redacted], Department of Physics, University of New Mexico, who states that it appears to be identical with the small batteries used in portable radios.

coupled with a total eight as the USSR incident, convinces me that either
the earth is under a most unusual cosmic bombardment or many of the
eyeballs are not meteorites at all. While I still cling to the meteoritic
hypothesis, it is clear that while ever statements are the right ones, the
situation cries aloud for thorough investigation.

ITEMS TAKEN AT NORTON, KANS., Night of Feb 16

He states-on evening above at Norton, while he wears that approximately 10:50 PM he was standing in the north window of the Post Office in Norton he looking toward the City Hall then he was suddenly illuminated very brightly by some horrible lights.

He ran outside into the street where others were looking toward the northeast at a very large cloud of white smoke high in the sky, he stated that in about a minute and a half, there was a terrific explosion followed by a heavy rumbling noise like thunder and that the smoke cloud was moving here all the time. Also there was a white smoke trail in the sky from the southwest where the missile had come from.

He said that from the center of the street, the explosion and the first big mushroom of smoke was directly overhead and at a tremendous height.

He stated in an interview that just prior to the explosion, he had heard the motors of an airplane.

Chief Scott learned from some man in Norton that just following the explosion, something fell at his feet on the street and he picked it up, to find that it was a small flashlight battery resembling those used in fountain pen flashlights and that it was very hot. After a crowd of men gathered and examined it, he was unable to find it, and thinks that someone took it.

Someone on East of Norton was about 5 miles South of Prairie View then he heard something roaring in the sky to the West of him, far away and very high. He says that it resembled a rocket travelling northeast ward and downward, and that suddenly there was a terrific explosion followed by a formation of white smoke and that there followed other explosions or something other explosions. About like he said the first one quiet-like periodic eruptions, in other words, losing activity.

A boy by name, -, was standing beside father at the time and heard the high roar overhead, raised a finger to a westerly direction to indicate fringe and he saw at Norton a mushroom of smoke.

EXHIBIT 3

Statements taken from ____ and ____

My name is ____ and I live on a farm 4¬Ω miles west of Stockton
and 1¬Ω miles north of St R 26.

On Thursday 12 at about 5 P.M., I was standing near my hog-pen about 100'
east cf my house, when I heard the pheasants raising a disturbance and the
chickens all rushed to the chicken-house. I looked round toward the house
to see who was causing it and saw something hovering just above the house,
over toward the house, and then lowered over the north end of the house
and settled toward me toward the hog-pen. Then very near me, approximately 5'
then it lowered a little and with a wig and jerk, milled around for an
instant, flame belching out of it and away and back in the thing went about
7' in a jagged something like a funnel. There was a pipe sticking out at the
back of it, and gas as it wobbled around; the shape was sticking out as fire
it suddenly threw some logs or pipes or some round thing, and this thing
descended as if a tube might have lighted and it took off in a northwesterly
direction very fast, climbing slightly as it went. My wife heard it when and
ran out where I stood, and we watched it; leaving a trail of smoke all the
time, smoke where it was a great cloud of smoke in the sky, not more than
1¬Ω‚Äù in diameter by 3¬Ω‚Äù. It was not in motion for more than 10 or 15 seconds
we figured it, then stopped for almost ten seconds or more, we heard an
explosion a bang, just as if it could blow all the air in out. I went in this
been washing my car prior to the occurrence, stating that word, there would
have been maybe spit in the yard where the thing started up because there was
a great rush of fire past it when it left. It must have been quite high when
it exploded.

There was a day, Son of ____ at about 5:00 Kingston on RS 36, at the time,
was driving north side U. Highway. At, his aunt's 5 or 5:30 ____, at its arc of time
station on his house in the range, there is a braid something queer in the sky.
Looking up to the south-west, he saw what appeared to be an Arabian package
lead the thing had been driven he saw in traverse, it landed and then rose
dashed off the house. He then mentioned, veered its course, almost on
a level not losing altitude a little, and it then exploded with a big clond
of smoke, apparently over Morton, from whence he was, south of Prairie View,
he rode on toward home a ways, when suddenly the second and part of the explosion
reached him. Nay, he was home in the house, when he heard and felt something
felt and felt ... ast it may have stuck the house. The rain part of the house and ten
times a narrow escaped cloud of smoke, about ten minutes later, a part of the

Dear Sir;

I should be very glad to talk with you when you

probably shall be, but, sometimes this time of the year
I go on my Venezuelan trips.

Meanwhile, the radiant, the Fireball of Feb. 15,
2300 MST. C.U.T., over northern Mojave, I can now by the 19
see no reason to believe that this object was a normal daylight
thing. It did not maintain a just a dead cloud and in all
probabliity demonstrated itself just beyond the sun's (final point.
I can not place any Lateral change here with clarity on map,
nor recount play among coordinated and new colored sightings
supplied who was there to report and the newspaper
editor at Morton.

The azimuth maximum (direction of fill was projected
to a ground arc of filament 11 with north 700 East. The
the (cone) of ascent with the horizontally merely 500 yards
of but was probably 300 or less. The visible and point and
cloud collision was nearly over Page 27, a little town near 
that location. This is abstract only as I can always
be reached by and sub-fill is one of those aberration things
dealing with objects falling. The investigation also falls
in with the light part of cycle in mists, but I think the tale 
escalation higher up nor off the honest count of cotton.

March 6. In matter of Winslow, Ariz., Feb 20 (the trip

this had the horizonal aspect as same quantity. This so
much was for light rated on to the map place, but this

wave affecting days, as was strong for meteoritic with
it no success. Personal, Individual searches are normally
economically practical in such cases, but in this instance I
might yield a result.

it is a fair guess, from the dust cloud, that the
item involved was instinctively friable and crumbly, and
it did not sift through the hands and fingers‚Äîa notably small sand.
Else its components would be larger than wheat or peanuts.
A man with an astronomical telescope, knowingly located in
the right place, might be able to find with his sun detecting apparatus,
something that crashed only a few miles away within a few
hours‚Äîprobably are lost forever.

A photograph of the cloud was taken by an amateur
in Central Utah and sent to A.P. I have a copy of the picture
onaria.

It is barely possible that I will make a trip soon
out to the location. I know of no one who has retrieved
a meteor that they have actually seen descending while they
were logically equipped. All of this is unprecedented, and
almost fantastic, but I would like to have a piece less loosely
held by the hands on things scientific and technical, and it would be
appropriate for me to interfere in this search with a
meteor. I would be standing in the sun for maybe a couple
of hours. (Perhaps that is his reason for his reluctance.)
I have been on the other side of the fence; if you do a
railroad investigation work on a threadbare, you can't hide
the evidence or cling to it and hide the tangible results away
for when they materialize.

Yours sincerely,

13 March 1948
INTERVIEW WITH MR. OSCAR E. MONNIG
Secretary, National Meteoritical Society

1. On 13 March 1948, while on a navigational training flight to Ft. Worth, Texas, Major Melvin W. Faulk interviewed Mr. Oscar E. Monnig. Mr. Monnig is Secretary of the National Meteoritical Society. He has been actively engaged, as an amateur, in research on and the collection of meteorites since 1930, and hence is regarded as an expert on the subject.

2. Mr. Monnig quoted two other authorities on the subject. Their names and addresses are:

a. Professor H. H. Mininger
P.O. Box 1171
Winslow, Arizona

b. Dr. C. C. Wylie
University of Iowa
Iowa City, Iowa

3. Major Faulk quosted Mr. Monnig specifically on the explosion of a supposed meteorite at 1705 CST, 13 February 1948. It was stuted that this phenomenon was definitely that of a meteorite, or daytime fireball. The most conclusive evidence of this is a photograph taken of the dust cloud left by the fireball. This photograph was taken from a point 13 miles north of Morton, Kansas by Duane E. Pomeroy of Norton, Kansas. Mr. Pomeroy had the foresight to this photograph to Mr. Monnig. The flight of a meteorite through our atmosphere can be divided into three phases. It is observed to come into the earth, that is sail through the air, as a black body, at a temperature of about 45‚ÑÉ. Upon reaching the air layer of the earth, it becomes a triple-phase head and is subjected to increasing pressure; this causes a release of a trail of gases which usually explode at an altitude of about 20 miles above the earth. After the explosion, a viable dust cloud remains in the atmosphere. The meteorite now usually consists of a cluster of small stones which continue on to strike the earth. Their pattern of impact de- pends upon the inclination of their flight path with the earth's surface, and varies from a slightly oval to an elongated ellipse. It is at this point the interested, the point of impact is calculated, and interested parties, such as observers, make a search for the particles. The particles, when found, usually resemble small stones and are composed chiefly of silicates, hem- be a curved shell surrounding the particles, usually about a ‚Öõ in., thick, which is an ordinarily of chiding origin of a few ounces

Final evidence that the 13 February incident was a fireball will be the discovery of meteoritic particles. The discovery will probably be confirmed by Professor Mininger, since the territories calculated to have fallen over as a result of the explosion are under his closest observation. 
(CRUDDED OUT)

there may not occur very soon, or it may be as long as 12 months before any particles are found,

5. Mr. Morning exhibited a series of four photographs taken of a meteorite
dust cloud or "train" taken on 20 May 1944 by Cpl. A. L. Annis, ASN 52790171,
c/o Photo Section, PAAF, Pampa, Texas. The present address of the corporal is
unknown, but his photographs are copyrighted. Acquisition of these and other
photographs of similar nature would be valuable for Project "SIGN" for com-
parative purposes. Mr. Morning requested that if the copyright owner of these
photographs is located, he be informed so that he may obtain additional copies.

6. Mr. Morning quoted the book, "The Book of the Damned" by Charles Fort
as an interesting collection of unexplained aerial phenomena. He said that
the incidents are authentic, but Mr. Fort's conclusions and interpretations
are fantastic.

7. Mr. Morning said that he will keep this office informed of his opinions
on any future sightings of aerial phenomena that come to his knowledge.

Attn: Maj. W. M. Faulk (V/CA)

Dear Sir:

While there was never any doubt in my mind, I can now report to
you finally that there is tangible proof that the fireball of Feb. 13 over
Northern Kansas was just that, inasmuch as meteorites have been recovered
from it.

Three were found beginning Apr 24, First several smaller fragments
up to maybe 1-1/2 pounds came to light. Then a distributor moving into a clover
field led to the digging up of a piece of some 109 pounds about two feet in
the soil.

You can get details from the various scientists I referred you to before.
Also Prof. H. H. Nininger made the preliminary report to me, Dr. L. La Paz
came in later and got most of the material concerned. To date, you could
write either of them for details or confirmation as the type is what is
termed an "H conadrite," a technical Chrondrite however unusual heavy meteorite.
It is reported to be of a type which will deteriorate rapidly. I have
also examined many of it's atoms.

Incidentally, when we talked together you may recall that I asked
you whether you could help me locate a former Cpl. Adkins, Trueba
yourself no further, as I found him by inquiry thru ordinary channels.

Now I'll send you enother [error] favor. In some possible work in areas
containing iron meteorites, I could use a metal detector weakly. I have
been checking into the types of units the Army had left and sold as surplus,
find that they had some AN/PRS-2 and in trying for half way the same,
am told that there was also detectors, who could utilize that asian Information
or types (instructions, etc,), and why he could find whether semi 
valuluables? I have located two surplus outfits who sell these, but am
wondering if the Army or the War Assets has any more.

Sincerely,

Cedar Morris

ATTENTION: Maj. Homer D. Boren
(Direct Communicational is Authorized)

1. Information obtained does not call for the recovery
of ANG balloon No. ###, launched 28 October 1949, nevertheless, due to inability
of station to furnish master file card on each unrecovered balloon, this
headquarters is unable to determine status of this specific balloon. It is desired
therefore, that following is accomplished. 
a. Interview all available individuals who possess any personal knowledge
concerning the missing balloon. Individuals to be interviewed are to include all
company grade officers assign[unreadable] the project, i.e., officer in charge of 
tracking crews and those crews assigned thereto, in addition to member of
the administrative section. A careful check should be made as to records and
correspondence concerning arrangements for launching, tracking, and recovery
facilities, etc., and submit that portion pertinent to failure to recover balloon. 
b. As additional items which are deemed significant sppara [There seems to be a typo in the original document here as "significant sppara" does not make sense], these should be
forwarded with the report.

2. A brief description of recovery methods utilized by your station as applied
to ANG balloons should be included in the report. Any deviations from normal
procedures should be carefully noted together with reasons thereof.

(Everything below this point is either very blurred or cutoff, making it unreadable.)

Please note that due to the poor quality of the scan, some parts of the text were not clearly readable, especially where indicated with [unreadable] or the possible presence of a typo.

- page 56 -

The photograph depicts what appears to be a series of bright, irregularly shaped dots or blobs arranged in a non-linear formation against a dark background, stretching diagonally across the image. The image is grainy and low in contrast, with a couple of bright points near the upper edge that seem to be holes or marks on the photo. There is text in the bottom right corner, but the image quality is poor and the full text is illegible, only the word "PHOTO BY" is clearly visible.

Regarding your request to replicate any text on the document, there's not enough discernible text present to fulfill your OCR request. The poor image quality adds to the difficulty in making out any details beyond the clearly readable "PHOTO BY". If there is additional text in the document outside of the photograph, it is not visible within the current view provided.

- page 57 -

The photograph appears to be a black and white image showing an unidentified object or objects in the sky. There are two bright spots near the top of the image, which could be lights or reflections, and a curving line or trail of some sort near the bottom, possibly smoke, vapor, or a cloud. The photo is quite grainy, and it's challenging to make out clear details. The image captures something that may be in motion, given the presence of the trail, but it's difficult to ascertain the exact nature of the object(s) from this photo alone.

There appears to be text captioning the photograph, but it is not completely legible due to the resolution and quality of the image provided. It seems to say "PHOTO BY" followed by text that cannot be clearly discerned. If you can provide a better-quality image or more context, I may be able to offer a more detailed description or attempt to transcribe more accurately.

- page 58 -

The image appears to be a black and white photograph with a highly grainy or noisy texture, which makes it difficult to discern specific details. There are two bright spots in the upper corner, likely the result of the photograph being pinned or held in place, and an irregularly shaped white object or formation near the center against a dark background, perhaps indicating some sort of motion or anomaly captured. There are no distinct details that can confirm the nature of the object or formation within the photo.

There is a label or a watermark that reads "PHOTO G" visible at the bottom right of the image. No other text is present within the photograph itself. If there is additional text within the document, it is not visible in the provided image.

HQ ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

MEMORANDUM FOR: MR. KENWORTHY

The attached sketches are interpreted as possible severe repercussions to future
conclusions as to what was the descending fireball of December 9, 1948 in the 
Green River, Colorado region, from which a red ball of long phosphorescent tail
was seen, and no material having been recovered. The glowing ball of March 6
continues to hold its big part of conforming the pattern set by the two 
striation falls, in that investigators through a high authority identified
each of the settled zinc sample did indeed mark the long luminous course
surpassed our earth on this fall.

The characteristics analysis of Japan's group of microscopical meteorites
establishes the necessary microscopic size of 2milligrams and in
small fiber forms. Expected sources are still not publicly noted, the
presence of Indium certainly not an act of man origin product.
A constant paint of the film sediment cannot be said to be terrestrial
origin since none remains as it settles which does not leave the residue
of inorganic decomposition which by analysis should be fully noted and
satisfactory references made in the past 150 years. The pattern maintained in 
the falls indicate an exterior origin to our earth by the blue inclusions and
by the radic (radiated?) forms found. Experimental quartz glass extravasations and
crystals too a very low level for meteoric theory, since it forms a coarse
structure is in the decomposed rock products not noted in the
striation of falls. The quartz crystal theory, which one prominent met. has
attributed to all the falls, certainly does not apply to quartz forms passing
through our atmosphere to the earth. Insoluble, indestructible the stout striation
of a red of iron blue is impassable except by high velocity object entering earth's
atmosphere as it has done to the trench near Sandy Hook where two iron objects at 
two different diameters but lying near on the earth has been found.

Review by the Army Biological Laboratory on these unknown isolations 
did not find what they were, the materials of MO in laboratory of Indiana
polis, Ind., by the expert Mr. Philip [...] who finds no answer for his
expert, it seem impossible however, with the 1/2 tonnage of aerial
recording evidently of the fall areas in which the fires and the showers
of quick moving lighted materials which followed each other in rapid
quick burst laws. (Translation: The physical appearances and reasons should
be the special servicing to air corps against fire in the lower control top
under the direction of General Lewis H. Brereton, USA, US/OCom, ZI/Ops
and Weather.)

Filter a constant study make outside of the photographs of the
new gold quartz mineralogical piece which ranges in 3 inch diameter, with 
veins just intermitting strength size and 2 foot long, 12 inch wide
piece, it met. dust, lap 010, intermixed&here., 19%. Thus it is
from big phenomena that surpass the terrestrial mineral analysis
upon quartz in igneous, metamorphic, rhyolite and granite evidenced
matter to its form specifications.

Subject: Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon
Over Green River, Utah the 12/13th

Reference: 1794th Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon
Investigation Report dated 2 March 1953

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

1. Reference is made to your interest upon the enclosed report
of an unidentified aerial object.

2. The photograph(s) mentioned in the enclosed report referring to
the alleged unidentified aerial object that is allegedly contained somewhere
on the microfilm in reference is too blurred, due to an extremely high closing
rate of the two objects, to have a fair feature. The 1794th District Office had
not possessed the original microfilm since the two objects were initially
photographed. Special Weapons Command has always been in possession
of the original microfilm. The Department, apparently under misunderstanding,
forwarded reprints obtained after a tract of this microfilm was uncovered
and traced to the Goody's hidden facility and subsequently led this office
back to the manufacturers of equipment and personnel.

3. The reprints now forwarded were forwarded for your information and
use and at no time were they represented as that of "flying saucers" or
flying objects that have received much conjecture of late with the public. No optical
illusions were contained in these microfilms, and what movies were received
have been forwarded.

This office cannot forward as requested for your information and perusal
a copy of the requested "good" picture that is assumed if your headquarters
has advertingly or inadvertently charged photographic coverages and that these are classified
and unobtainable tape.
