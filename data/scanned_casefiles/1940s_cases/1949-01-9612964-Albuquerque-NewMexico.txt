SUMMARY OF GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE
The Adjutant General, United States Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Information to be sent to the Stockholm Royal Institute Aero Reports
submittance above, dated 22 March 1950.

1. Referenced final last of three subjects [sic] (Lt Col Frank Peterson, Capt
Edward Yevin, 1st Lt Alan Johnson) to extreme acceleration by centrifuge at
this installation is closed, subject to resumption - a $1,250,000.00 facility and
cost completed and waiting in "moth balls". The reason: the British subjects
involved in a similar experimental program have not been heard from since initial
experiments of high "G" force. Our subjects now at USAF hospitals in serious
but not critical condition; prognosis favorable. Previous reports indicated
functioning completeness of protective physiological covering, (i.e. sealed
atmospheric suit equipped with helmet, oxygen supply or CO2 filtrating system,
nourishment intake, waste removal systems, sensory and audio-video systems).

2. All subjects passed through twenty-one point "LIFO" evaluations, certified
fit; expert opinion from Albuquerque, N. M., that the train timetable bell
operates only when the conductress is both alert and responsive to the
subjective overtones channeled to her mind in certain situations; initial reports
to be declassified.

3. Reference the Fourth requirement of LIFO's statement, certified
reports copies from Albuquerque, N. M., that the Owl (sic) Express Ltd
company has at its own responsibilities taken into governmental confidence with
the view toward channeling to the minds an incision performance without cutlass
to the subjects.

4. The objective priority is forewarned from your de-encryption text now
clear. The presumption here that Johnson has incurred your indecision owing
to his convincing conviction psychologically convinced of that his train de-railed
on the anticipated route.

At 1635 hours on 4 December 1949, while enroute from Dallas, Texas to Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, in a C-47 aircraft, Major ___ , pilot of the aircraft, sighted an unidentified object in the vicinity of Covington and Hammond, Louisiana. The report was corroborated by the co-pilot and crew chief of the C-47. The object was reported as being spherical in shape, silver in color, and at approximately the same altitude as the aircraft in flight -- 5500 feet. The observer was unable to determine the size of the object, or distance from the aircraft, but he stated that the apparent elipse was about that of a half-dollar placed on the windshield of the aircraft at the subject's normal seating attitude. The object

was coming toward the aircraft from due east (300 degrees) at an undetermined speed, it was only after than in the aircraft. The first impression of the observer was that it was another aircraft in a joint-stance, so he started to change his own course. The object veered across the path of the aircraft at a high rate of speed, then seemed to stop and bob up and down on position. After having been in view for approximately three (3) minutes, the object crossed another burst of filed and faded from view. In this movement, the object observed the observers 'Polaroid Windscreen (in the second of the observer could distinguish no definite sounds coming from the object because of the sound of his own aircraft. There was no exhaust visible and no distinguishing features were noted.

5 December 1949

SUBJECT: Surface Synoptic Situation and Winds Aloft, 4 December 1949

TO: Base Intelligence Officer
Keesler Air Force Base, Miss.

1. No synoptic weather observations are made at the actual point 
in question...i.e., 30 degrees 15 minutes west and 50 degrees 30 minutes
north; the closest observations being those at New Orleans some 35 miles
south. The general synoptic situation for the area was as follows:

A cold front oriented northeast-southwest had moved across the
area approximately five hours earlier replacing the Maritime Tropical
air with cool, dry Continental Polar air. There was a thin scattered layer
of cirrus at 30,000 feet and occasional scatted patches of strato-cumulus at 5,000 feet over the area. Surface visibility was ten miles.
Surface winds were from the northeast at 10-12 knots.

b. Winds aloft for the area were the following: At 2,000 feet wind
from 50 degrees at 20 knots, 4,000 feet from 30 degrees at 10 knots, 6,000
feet from 30 degrees at 10 knots, 8,000 feet from 340 degrees at 10 knots,
10,000 feet from 340 degrees at 10 knots, 12,000 feet from 320 degrees at
15 knots, Remainder of winds up to 35,000 feet are from a general 320
degrees at 40 knots, increasing to 70 knots at 35,000 feet.

2. Regarding celestial phenomena, the air almanac shows that the
planet Venus would be at an angle of approximately 50 degrees above the
horizon at an azimuth of 220 degrees from the north at 1635 C. There were
no other stars or planet of sufficient magnitude to be visible at that
time.

Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, authorized to administer oaths in cases of this nature, Major (BLANK) (BLANK) passenger and "deadheaders" stewardess, for the purpose and upon the case, as follows, to-wit: A sworn statement of his/white to wit: that Article of war and upon being sworn according to law, deposes and says;

"On 4 December 1949 at approximately 1635 hours while on a flight from Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, to Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, Assiss[T]ippi, in a C-47 type aircraft, I observed a spherical type object, proceeding at our level from about one o'clock. The object was approaching at a terrific rate of speed and appeared to be approximately 20 to 25 miles away. At first observation, I believed that it was a remotely controlled aircraft and made an effort to warn one of the auto-pilots when the spherical object came to an abrupt halt and changed to a course of 90° westerly route. At a terrific rate of speed and a northerly direction across our route. It seemed to accelerate in an incredible rate as stipulating it was noticed that the object appeared to gain altitude and absolutely it was absolutely stationary. Our position at the time was approximately 10 to 15 miles north of Las Alamos Contamination resort and location on a heading of 120° degree. My co-pilot was watching the timekeeper and I can't recall the co-pilot's reaction to my insisting that the object was extraordinary. I called the crew chief from the rear compartment to observe and he gave it as a "I can't believe it." I observed the object for approximately two minutes the time I called the crew chief. At the rear compartment to observe, to come up to the pilot's compartment. I observed the object in the same manner as the co-pilot and myself. It is judical that the object was observed by the co-pilot and myself for approximately four minutes. The spherical type object was last seen on a northwesterly heading at white. It is also appeared as suddenly as it replaced. I tried to reconcile the phenomenon by believing that it was a reflection from another aircraft due to the hazy conditions and the position of the late afternoon sun; however, I have never observed any was aircraft perform in such an unorthogdox manner."

Further deponent sayeth not.

STATEMENT

Personally appeared before me a commissioned officer of the U.S.
Army's Air Forces, a credible witness, in the person of _________, and
made the following statement under oath:

"My name is ________. I am employed by the Civil Aeronautics
Administration. Before my present employment, I was in the U.S. Air Corps
for 12 years. I was a B-29 instructor pilot and at present, according to
law, possess a secret.

"On the 14th day of December, 1948, at about 1625 hours, I was on a routine
flight from Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, to Kirtland Air Force
Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. I was flying a T-6 type aircraft, at an
altitude of 8,500 feet and a 210° true course. My co-pilot at the time was very
able to identify the land-marks between Fort Worth, Texas, and Tucumcari, New
Mexico. In the vicinity soon as we came to the conclusion we were airborne
and myself occupied the pilot and co-pilots seat respectively of our aircraft.
Our altitude was 6500 feet and our compass heading was 100 degrees. Suddenly,
I noticed another aircraft entering the distance ahead, and slightly to
the right. I looked away for a few seconds and when I looked again, I saw the
round object converging upon us from about two o'clock position. It was at
the same altitude level as was plane and went travelling at a tremendous rate of
speed. My first reflection was that this object was a fighter type aircraft
glowing for the effect of the altitude position, but very soon discovered
faster than any jet I ever recalled seeing. Observing it a moment, we were
very able to figure out that the object was of no aircraft make. Very suddenly it
changed its course so that it crossed over in front of us. It also seemed to
come to an abrupt stop and appeared to bob up and down. Now I could see that
it was perfectly- circular in shape and very large. Major ________ asked me
I saw what he saw, to which I replied that I did. The Major then said "What do you
suppose that is?" I answered, "I don't know." He signaled for the flight
engineer (S/Sgt. ______) to come forward and view the spectacle. He did so
but he too was unable to identify the weird object. The three of us watched
as it accelerated: then slowed and finally, rapidly, in a zigzag course
again and went in a westerly direction. "Nothing it disappeared with
great swiftness, just as though it had been turned out. I estimate the
length of time we observed all this to be three minutes."

Further deponent sayeth not.

1st lt., USAF

Subscribed and sworn to before me this the 15th day of December, 1948, at
Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

     Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, an officer to admis-
ter oaths in cases of this nature, Staff Sergeant , 
Flight Squadron, 509th Air Base Group, Walker Air Force Base, Roswell,
and, upon being warned of his rights under the 6th Article of War and upon
being duly sworn according to law, deposes and says:

     I was the engineer on AT Airplane No. 49-2656, a C-47 enroute to
Keesler Field, Mississippi, from Roswell Air Force Base on the 4th day of
December, 1949. Major  was the pilot of the afore-mentioned
airplane and I was riding as the co-pilot. While I was occupying the
navigator's seat, approximately 1535 hours, approximately
140 miles west of Keesler Field, at an altitude 9,000 to 10,000 feet,
approximately six to eight miles in front of us at approximately 1000 feet
altitude, S/Sgt.  and I, from a C-47 saw a silver, shiny object
to traveling at a high rate of speed in the same direction our aircraft was
going, I.E., about an azimuth of 92° from this object to the 9 o'clock position
of the aircraft. I watched this object for approximately two minutes before
it disappeared. It was white and can be described as teardrop shaped without
object was. I believe it could have been a reflection.

     Attention: MCIAAX9

       IAXPA

1. Reference letter Headquarters USAF, subject: Reporting
of Information on Flying Discs, dated 6 February 1949, the
following report is submitted:

    a. At 1720C, 4 December 1949, Major S. C. Whittakers,
pilot of AF 5566, a C-47, enroute from Carswell AFB, Texas to
Keesler AFB, Mississippi, notified Maxwell FSC that he had observed
an unidentified flying object over Covington, Louisiana at 1635C
4 December 1949. The object was described as one sphere shaped,
bright silver color, about the size of a half dollar. When first
sighted the object appeared to be approaching AF 5566 head-on at
an altitude of 5500 feet and the speed was estimated to be in
excess of 600 miles per hour. When first observed the object was
travelling West and approximately 30 seconds later it changed course
abruptly to the South. During the 3 to 5 minutes of observation
by the pilot and crew the object went through a series of rapid
declinations and accelerations and made several sharp changes in
direction and altitude. No vapor trails were visible during the
time of observation. The outstanding characteristic as quoted by
the pilot, "It appeared to bounce all over the sky."

2. The weather at the time of the report was 30,000 scattered,
10 miles visibility, temperature 67, dew point 57, surface winds
from the Northeast at 13 miles per hour, altimeter setting 30.29.

3. The entire crew of AF 5566 were Major S. C. Whittakers,
pilot, 1st Lieutenant P. H. McDonald, co-pilot, and S/Sergeant C. Thomas,
engineer. All the above crew members observed the object reported.
Home station of the pilot and crew: Walker AFB, New Mexico.
