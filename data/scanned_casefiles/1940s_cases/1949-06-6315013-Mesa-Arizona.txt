Observation was sustained for about 30 minutes. The discs were metallic in composition, steel gray in color, varied in form depending on position at which viewed. Seven power binoculars were used for part of the time.

10. Appearance of object

    (a) Color - Steel gray reflected sunlight brilliantly; appeared
ruby red when viewed from great distances.

    (b) Shape - Consisted of two (2) principal parts, a disc supported 
by two (2) flanges extending around the disc. Appeared rectangular in some
positions. The sketches, shown in Inclosures 1 and 2, are reproductions of
rough sketches to show appearance at different distances.

    (c) Apparent construction - Metallic. **** is definite on this
even though flanges were flexible under what appeared to be air pressure.

11. Direction of flight:

    After the four (4), hovering near the cloud, had been observed
for about 20 minutes, they dispersed. One proceeded in a smooth direct course
to the southeast, a second moved straight east, a third went northeast, and the
fourth moved upward at about an 82 degree angle. The fifth object, which we
not visible at first, appeared in the west and moved eastwards.

12. Tactics or maneuvers:

    Four (4) were observed to move horizontally, one moved upward at
about an 82 degree angle.

13. Evidence of exhaust:

    None noted.

14. Effect on clouds:

    No effect noted.

15. Lights:

    Reflected sunlight brilliantly in some positions. Gave off ruby
red light at distance.

16. Support:

    The only visible means of support consisted of two flanges or
extensions from the inner disc. These flanges partially enveloped the disc.

17. Propulsion:

    (a) Propeller or jet - None noted.

    (b) Rotor - None noted.

    (c) Aerodynamic vanes - Extensions or flanges in front and back
of disc could serve as vanes.

    (d) Visible exhaust or jet openings - None noted.

18. Control and stability:

    (a) Fins - None noted. UNCLA... ("T")
    
    (b) Stabilizers - Conceivably the flanges or extensions from the
        disc could have served as stabilizers.
        
19. Air ducts:

    The only aperture reported was an opening between the flanges and
    disc which permitted a view directly through the object at certain positions.

20. Speed:

    Speeds varied during the 45 minutes of observation. A maximum of
    400 miles per hour was estimated.

21. Sound:

    No sound emanating from the object was heard.

22. Manner of disappearance:

    Faded from view.

23. Relative to the observer:

    Name: [Redacted]
    Address: [Redacted], Los Angeles, California
    Permanent mailing address: [Redacted], Arizona.
    Occupation: Owner of Old Gold Bond Mine at Goldfield, Arizona.
    
    Reliability:

    [Redacted] manner during the two hour interview was direct and
    businesslike. In personal appearance he was well dressed and neat. His
    descriptions were precise; his statements were coherent and consistent. The
    agent did notice, however, that [Redacted] was inclined to be emotional, and his
    face moved nervously on occasions. [Redacted] claims his vision is good, although
    he wears glasses to correct minor defects due to advancing age. He is about
    50 years of age.
    
    A check of the records at the University of Southern California
    reveals that [Redacted] took courses in education, Sociology and Psychology at
    that University in the summers of 1923 and 1924. No degree was obtained.
    These same records also reflect that he later attended the Lawton Business
    College at Mesa, Arizona. This information confirms [Redacted] statements
    concerning his education.
    
    [Redacted] claims to be an amateur astronomer, and to
    have his own telescope with 9-inch reflector.

The image presents a document with text and a simple line drawing. There is no photograph present. Below is the text from the document:

The image contains a simple sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch appears to be a rudimentary drawing of an object with a shape reminiscent of a classic flying saucer or UFO, with a dome on top and a flat bottom.
