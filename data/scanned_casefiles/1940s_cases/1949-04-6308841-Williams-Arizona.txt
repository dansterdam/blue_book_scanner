NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 30 April 1949, [redacted] Winslow, Arizona, [redacted] observed a "Fireball" phenomenon at 0915 hours on 12 April 1949, approximately ten (10) miles North of Winslow, Arizona. Interrogated was interviewed and advised he observed the "Fireball" uninhibited as it hung in the sky (shown the Azimuth existed at A). Only one (1) "Fireball" was seen and Informant was approximately 50 to 60 miles away. (Approximate location of the "Fireball" is within the area covered by the mountain on exhibit A). When interviewees first observed the "Fireball," it was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon and disappeared at approximately 13 degrees from the horizon. Considering the brilliance and clearness of the "Fireball," he estimated it was from 75 to 100 miles high. He saw the "Fireball" for two seconds before it faded from his farthest west was pink in color with the tail of a 120 watt light bulb at 25 feet. The "Fireball" rose in appearance, had the size of a Tom Paine operation while traveling a straight gun cource in a north westerly direction. However, he advised he was not positive of the direction of flight due to his angle of observation. In as much as Informant was indoors with his bedroom window closed, he heard no sound. He observed no evidence of smoke or exhaust and did not notice that it affected the clouds in any way. Considering the object was a meteorite, it would have been traveling at 26.2 miles per second. The "Fireball" faded from view and probably fell north and east of Las Vegas, Nevada. It might not have been seen many falling meters, but one seen on 13 April 1949 much larger and more brilliant than any he has seen. Informant knows of no other individuals who had seen the "Fireball."

Large Fireball
Seen In North

Seemed To Be Over 'Frisco Peaks
Traveling Toward The Northwest

A large green "fireball" or meteorite was sighted going to a northwesterly direction high above the San Francisco peaks at 1:48 a.m. today, according to George D. Thompson, assistant at the American Meteorite Museum.

The museum is 40 miles east of Flagstaff on Highway 66. "It was the brightest and brightest I have ever seen," Thompson said, "it woke me up. It cast shadows all through the museum and lit up the entire area."

He asks other persons who may have witnessed it to contact the museum and report the direction from which it came, where it went, and other data, so that a search may be started for the meteorite or fragments of it.

Persons at Grand Canyon, Williams, Gray Mountain, Tuba City, Cameron and Flagstaff are most apt to have seen it, Thompson said—

AT WILLIAMS, ARIZONA
UNCLASSIFIED

1. On 25 May 1949, mr ------ -------, Driver for the Continental Bus System was interviewed and advised he observed the FIREBALL or meteorite at 0146 on 18 April 1949, approximately 27 miles NW of Flagstaff, Arizona, (approximate location is within the area covered by rectangular on inclosure A). Informant was driving a Santa Fe bus, with his window closed, and was approaching some old Indian ruin at a mill (sawmill?) . As Informant and the bus wrote obssrved a sudden flash of light and saw this FLAMING FIRE 6 to 10 seconds at approximately 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. Only one FIREBALL was seen and it appeared to be not over 1000 feet above the terrain traveling a straight course in a northeasterly direction. The FIREBALL was blue green in color and Informant was unable to estimate its size. The speed of the FIREBALL appeared to be slightly slower than that of a falling star. Immense size or brightness was similar to no bus bought and as such no windows or sash part exhaust wide was note close this Heard noise. Informant denies seeing buccaneer any kind including captured craft or other craft. Informant’s son equally falling meteor, out some were as large and brilliant as the one seen on 18 April 1949, mr ------- knew of no other individuals who had seen the FIREBALL.

mr ------ ------- has been employed as a driver for the Continental Bus System approximately 10 years and has been driving throughout Arizona-Wyoming, California and round most of his routes day or nights without and windshield was horribly nightjunior or otherwise dusty hours at other nearby. Informant was also difficultly determining color or speed object’s, his reputation was drawn to the FIREBALL by its brilliance and closeness. Informant has no criminal record, enjoys a good reputation in the neighborhood, is intelligent and of good character.

THE LEADER, WILDWOOD, N. J., APRIL 7, 1949

Coast Guards - Police
Probing Flare Source

Coast Guards and Wildwood police on Thursday began an investiga-
tion to learn the source of a flare which fell on the roof of a fish dock at Otten's Harbor.

Carl Ostrom, who is associated with Estex Brothers' Association, reported to the coast guards the roof of the flare which struck the pier.

Coast Guards from the Cape May base, in their preliminary study ex-
pressed the belief the flare was fired from a gun at close range. They
seemed to think boats from Otten Harbor carry flares of the same de-
scription.

TUESDAY MORNING, APRIL 12, 1949

Ball of Fire Seen,
Believed Meteor

A brilliant ball of fire, believed by authorities to have been a meteor, was visible in a wide area of the Eastern Seaboard within reach of Washington, apparently “landing" last night in Delaware, and an important Army Air Force plane diverted unannounced to Delaware City in the midst of the ensuing perturbation. Most of the other eye-witnesses in the phenomenon were in New Jersey.

THOUGHT PLANE CRASHED

Sightings of the mysterious object by hundreds led them to report by radio to the New Castle County Air-police that they believed an airplane had crashed. Delaware State Police found no wreckage at the scene, could give no alternative.

William F. MacLaurlen, a member of the fire department at the New Castle airport, said the ball was “huge-green with a tail this [held his two fingers to indicate length],with red flame ”

MacLaurien said that the ball seemed “sizzling as an aeroplane-airship, and with no apparent immediate thoughts on the emergency landing. But within seconds the object disappeared behind buildings.

PILOT PURSUED IT

One of the signets, on a flight from Washington to Mitchell Field, L.I. said, “I am definitely plunging into the North America Administration's original philatelic amateurs' station while flying at 3000 feet.”

The same pilot later added by radio while he pursued the object in a low sizzling dive at 800 feet toward the rest of us.

The second pilot also involved saw another shot as it was viewed as a phenomenon. The sirens were scattered along the area where both landing and departure took place at the airport named the Lions Island field. Their identities were not disclosed.

SCORERS OF CALLS

Authorities at Harvard University Observatory said they received scores of calls from residents of Massachusetts , Rhode Island and Connecticut. They said it was probable that the meteor, if a?4sm, was one the largest into the area.

Two airline pilots were among the eye-witnesses. Ralph H. BUTLER. supervising navigator Bo or rborough of Bronx, New York, said their plane was approaching Providence, R.I., when they sighted “The Brighton Flame”, they had seen the object, as they estimated the altitude began to disintegrate at about 1000 feet.

"ATC OPINION CONC
UNCLASSIFIED

1949, ten (10) miles north of Flagstaff while indoors sitting in bed, Informant was 50 or 50 miles from FIREBALL and observed it for two (2) seconds. FIREBALL first seen at approximately 60 degrees above horizon and faded from view at 3 degrees. Considering brilliance and closeness of FIREBALL estimated its size was 70 to 100 yards high; was round like an appearance; was about the size of a 100 watt light bulb at 25 feet and bright green in color with a bluish tail. FIREBALL traveled a straight course in north westerly direction. No sound was heard; no smoke or exhaust was evident and informant did not notice the effects on clouds. Considering FIREBALL as a meteoroid, would be traveling 22.62 miles per second. FIREBALL probably fell to earth south and east of Las Vegas, Nevada. Informant knows of no one who has ever seen a FIREBALL except one said to be employed by Dr. [name redacted] for 13 years and has been a museum for 2 and 3 years as guide and lecturer. Informant enjoys fire- arms and rock collecting as hobbies; has no difficulty in evaluating color or speed; is well educated; is an amateur astronomer and of good character. The following individuals either know of no one who has seen FIREBALL – had not heard of it, Adams [name redacted], Crazy Mountain, Arizona; -------- ----------, Grand Canyon, Arizona; MP [name redacted], MP #1235 [name redacted] and all of Williams, Arizona. [name redacted], Sedona, Arizona did not see and not see FIREBALL. Phoenix Gazette news clip obtained and included as exhibit.

DETAILS.

1. This investigation is predicated upon a news article in the Phoenix Gazette, dated April 13, 1949 stating that a large FIREBALL traveling in a northwesterly direction was sighted at 5 AM on the morning of 5 April 1949, near Flagstaff, Arizona by [name redacted] Assistant Director of the American Meteor Museum.

AT FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA

2. On 19 April [illegible], Reverend [name redacted], 12 West Columbus Street, Pastor of the Lutheran Church, was interviewed and advised that he was sitting in his parsonage at Sedona by [illegible] room window, Arizona on 15 April 1949 when he observed the FIREBALL of meteoritic lore, (illegible or two (2) seconds at 2000. Informant was approximately eight (3) miles east of Williams, Arizona on Highway 66 (designated by an X on the Prescott Sectional Aeronautical Chart, Exhibit A) when he saw a brilliant flash of light and two (2) seconds later observed the FIREBALL. The FIREBALL lighted the northern horizon, and [name redacted] believed it was north and east of Flagstaff, Arizona (approximate location shown by a circle on Exhibit A). The FIREBALL appeared to be approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, traveling in an easterly or north easterly direction at 12,000 feet. Informant advised he was approximately 15 miles from the FIREBALL and that it was emerald green in color. The FIREBALL appeared to be meteoritic and this observer's estimate it was the largest one he had ever seen. Informant was unable to estimate the speed of the FIREBALL and heard no sound inasmuch as windows till nearly as was otherwise was the condition closed. The sky was cloudy and the FIREBALL had no apparent effect on the clouds. The FIREBALL traveled in a straight line and particularly disappeared into a cloud."

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 19 April 1949, Informant __________________, Pastor
of the Lutheran Church, was interviewed and advised that he was sitting in the rear
of a Santa Fe bus returning from ____________, Arizona on 15 April 1949, when he observed
the Fireball for duration of two (2) or two (2) seconds at 0300. Informant was
approximately eight (8) miles east of Williams, Arizona on Highway 66 (designated by
an X on the Prescott Sectional aeronautical Chart, Exhibit A) when he saw a brilliant
flash of light and two (2) seconds later observed the Fireball. The Fireball silhouetted
the northern horizon and Informant believed it was North and East of Sillgreaves
Mountain (approximate location shown by a circle on Exhibit A). The fireball appeared
to be approximately 30 degrees above the horizon traveling in an easterly direction
at a rapid rate of speed. The total observed time was approximately 16 hours from
this Fireball and then it was greenish blue in color. The Fireball appeared to be a
meteorite and the observer advised it was the largest one he had ever seen. Informant
was unable to estimate the speed of the Fireball and heard no sound inasmuch he was
riding near the bus engine with the windows closed. The sky was cloudy and the Fireball
had no apparent effect on the clouds. The Fireball traveled in a straight line and
mysteriously disappeared behind an obstacle. This observer was unable to give any
further information and knew of no one on the bus or in the community who had seen the
Fireball.
