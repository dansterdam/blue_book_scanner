        letter, 7/24/49 -- The undersigned and ___________________, both of Lafayette, were fishing at the Merrill Store quarry just back of the Monon R. Railroad station at Delphi, on the evening of Saturday, July 23rd.
        At approximately 11 P.M. Daylight Saving Time, Robertson called to me, saying; "What are those lights flying around in the sky?"
        I came over and looked where he pointed. There were two luminous objects in the sky to the North of Delphi, at an approximate elevation of 1,500 feet. These two objects were soaring in circles. The one on the right was flying horizontally in an orbit, clockwise. The object on the left was flying in an orbit, counter-clockwise.
        ______ said, "Those must be the flying disks of which I have heard." We watched the objects. As they approached the near portion of the orbit they would emit a phosphorescent glare. They were flying at a terrific speed, and as they flashed around they would appear to tower us, then as they disappeared on the far swing of the orbit, would appear far ahead the flat portion which appeared as a glowing straight line until they faded from view.
        The courses which the objects took, while flying in circles, was somewhat erratic. They would dip and dive just as would a plane in taking evasive action.
        We had two flashlights, and we focussed the two spots together and held the objects as they came past, just as a hunter leads a flying pheasant. Then it was that we could make out that they were tangible objects. They appeared to be made of some shining metal, aluminium or magnesium, and appeared to be, as well as we could judge from their estimated height, about the size of a five room house in the area they covered.
        I then went across the road to a house and found a man sitting on the porch. I got him to come out and look at the objects. He said that he was going to call the editor of the Delphi paper, and the police department.
        Shortly after this several powerful searchlights swept the sky, following the disks; those of the police or fire department, I presume.
        Shortly after this the objects gradually kept getting farther away until they disappeared from view over the horizon. Approximately 30 minutes later they re-appeared, this time to the left of the place in the sky where they had first been seen. They flew in orbits in that area until, I would say, about 1 A.M. Daylight

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
Saving Time; then disappeared for a few minutes and took up their paths in the original place in the heavens, where we first noticed them.
   We watched them as we cast for bass in the stone quarry until 3 A. M. Daylight Saving Time, at which time they faded from sight and we saw them no more. Through the entire time we viewed the objects they were continually flying.
   I might state that neither I nor any companion were in the last imaginative or neurotic. We had not partaken of any stimulants or narcotics whatsoever and so were able to view these objects in the full possession of our faculties.
   This we will attest. They were real, tangible objects, presumably of metal, aluminum or magnesium, as I have stated before, as we could plainly see in the combined spots of our flashlights, and the searchlights which were trained on the objects confirmed this.
   One idea is that. They might be a northern light phenomena. This we discard this theory since northern lights do not move in regular orbits in a regular directions.
   Then we speculated as to their being searchlights thrown out. I walked out in an open field and look, but could see no ray of I;ht which will shine up from the ground as a luminous band when a search-light or beacon is trained upward.
   They could not be landing field beacons. The nearest landing field is at Logansport, a considerable distance from Delphi.
   The thought that they might be large bats or birds, whose wings reflected rays of the city lights of Delphi as they flew, entered our minds. I went to the edge of the road, and placed myself between the nearest street light and the objects and they still showed the same glow as they spun around in their orbits.
   We took those precautions as there has been a lot of joking talk and news stories kept appearing about the "flying saucers" being xrrax various planets which shine brilliantly, due to favorable atmosphere conditions, or their proximity to the earth. Planets, while they move, their movement is only noticeable on the direction finder of a large telescope, and can not be detested by the naked eye alone.
   We make the statement that the objects we saw flying; through the sky of are solid construction. There have been so many reports on seeing; them that there is bound to be foundation of fact concerning them, Just as the rockets which not so long ago appeared over Sweden.

This statement is given to you for such evaluation as you see fit to make.

Lafayette, Indiana,
July 24, 1949.

The undersigned and a friend, both of Lafayette, 
were fishing at the Merrill stone quarry just back of the Monon

At approximately 11 P. M. Daylight Saving Time, ^ 
called to me, saying: "What are those lights flying around in

I have heard." We watched the objects. As they approached the
near portion of the orbit they would emit a phosphorescent flare.
They were flying at a terrific speed, and as they flashed around
the would appear face toward us, then as they disappeared on 
they far swing of the orbit, would appear to show the "flat portion
which appeared as a glowing straight line until they faded from 
view.

The course which these objects took, while flying in
circles, was somewhat erratic. They would dip and dive just as
would a plane taking evasive action.

We had two flashlights, and we focussed the two spots

jects. He said that he was going to call the editor of the Delphi
paper, and the police department.

Shortly after this several powerful searchlights swept
the sky, following the disks; those of the police or fire department,

DETAILS

1. Investigation was requested by Headquarters, United States Air
Force, The Inspector General, Office of Special Investigations, Washington 25,
D.C., pursuant to a letter from the 12th OSI District (IC), dated 28 July 1949,
concerning the sighting of flying objects by Mr. ------- of Lafayette,
Indiana, on 23 July 1949.

2. This investigation was conducted by Special Agent ENZIL F. WILDMAN.

AT LAFAYETTE, INDIANA

3. On 20 September 1949, Mr. --------------, age 50, Clerk in
the Accounting Department of Monon Route Railroad, --------------
age 23, clerk, Monon Route Railroad, ------------, and
were interviewed by Special Agent ENZIL F. WILDMAN and furnished him with the
following information concerning air phenomena at Delphi, Indiana, at approxi-
mately 2300 hours (CST) on Saturday, 23 July 1949:
Both in an old stone quarry at the northeast edge of Delphi, Indiana, when
--------- happened to look in the sky and saw two dimly illuminated objects
called ------------ attention to them. ------------ described the objects
as being approximately fifty feet in diameter, disk shaped and silver in color.
--------- and ----------- advised that the objects were highly maneuverable. One
disk was spinning in a clock wise direction in its own axis and the second
disk was spinning counter clock wise in its own axis and various loops,
turns and dives. Both --------- and --------- advised that the disks stayed
within a close proximity and in their opinion were connected together, and
appeared to be between 1500 and 2000 feet in altitude. The objects appeared
to be at a 45Â° angle with the horizon and at 11:00 o'clock direction when first
observed. The objects made no sound nor produced no odor. The objects were
observed for approximately four hours. They changed their positions from 11:00
o'clock to 11:00 o'clock then to 12:00 o'clock and gradually grew dimmer and
disappeared. -------------- stated that there were no clouds, no moon
and that the night was very dark.

4. In accordance with ACSI Letter 85, dated 12 August 1949, the
following information was supplied by -------- and ------------.

    A. Date of sighting - Saturday, 23 July 1949.
    B. Time of sighting - 2300 hours, CST.
    C. Where sighted - At the Delphi, Indiana, Stone Quarry, approxi-
        mately five blocks northeast of Delphi, Indiana. The observer
        was on the ground and the objects were sighted in the sky.
    D. Number of objects - Two.
    E. Observable celestial phenomena or planets that may account
        for the sighting - None.
    F. Distance of objects from observer - In the opinion of the
        observers, objects appeared to be at an approximate altitude
        of 1500 to 2000 feet and at 45Â° angle of elevation from
        horizon.
    G. Time in sight - approximately four hours.

---

H. Appearance of objects:
(a) Color - Silver
(b) Shape - Disk like and flat
(c) Apparent construction - unknown
(d) Size - Approximately 50 feet in diameter.
I. Tactics or maneuvers - Objects were revolving in a tremendous speed in their own axis; however, traveling speed was slow.
Objects did loops, dives and definite gyrations.
J. Direction of Flight - Objects were first sighted in a one o'clock position, From the one o'clock position, objects moved to a 11 o'clock position, then to a 12 o'clock position, from where they disappeared.
K. Evidence of exhaust or odor - None.
L. Effect on clouds - There were no clouds visible.
M. Lights - Object appeared luminous entirely.
N. Support - No evidence of support could be noted.
O. Propulsion - Objects appeared to be spinning with a tremendous speed.
P. Control or Stability - None visible.
Q. Air ducts, etc. - None visible.
R. Speed MPH - The speed of objects could not be determined insofar as traversing speed was very slow. It took objects over an hour to move from one o'clock position to 11:00 o'clock position.
S. Sound - None.
T. Manner of Disappearance - Faded from view.
U. Direction of Rotation - One object rotated in a clockwise direction and the other in a counterclockwise direction.

5. Informants stated that objects did not vary in distance from each other and were always in same position relative to each other. Objects disappeared from sight when in a flat position in relation to observer's eyes.

6. A check of nearby weather stations by Special Agent ââââ revealed no information pertinent to this investigation.

7. A neighborhood check at Delphi, Indiana, conducted 20 September 1949 resulted in no additional information regarding these objects.

8. A check at the Delphi, Indiana, Police Station on 20 September 1949 was negative. No flying objects had been reported on date in question.

9. RICHARD RAINDOLT, Editor, Delphi Journal, Delphi, Indiana, when interviewed on 20 September 1949, stated that no reports were made to the paper concerning flying objects.

10. ââââ further indicated that he saw what appeared to be a spot light of a car trying to pick up the objects; however, the beam did not reach the objects. Also, search lights were observed at a distance of about five miles in a North-eastern and Northwestern direction of the observers. (NOTE: The search lights were seen in the same direction as the objects; however, search lights were observed only part of the time.)

11. It is also to be noted that the Wabash River is located to the immediate Northwest of Delphi, Indiana. It is also possible that haze and mist may have formed over the river on the night in question.

12. Neither of the informants have since been able to contact persons who also observed the objects on the night in question.

13. It is the opinion of Special Agent DENZIL F. WILD[AN that neither of the informants sought publicity.

14. In the opinion of Special Agent DENZIL F. WILD[AN, [---] is above average in intelligence and appears to be a man of honest convictions and common sense. He was, up to 1944, a reported in the State House of Indiana. He does some writing at the present time. He was not drinking on the night in question nor was he wearing glasses.

15. In the opinion of Special Agent DENZIL F. WILD[AN, [---] is quiet mannered, of average intelligence. He served three years in the Navy.
