Dear Mr. ---------------:

Receipt of your letter, dated 25 July 1949, is respectfully acknowledged by this Headquarters.

Your reported sighting has been made a matter of record and is being incorporated into our present study of unidentified aerial objects.

Although the information submitted does not contain sufficient detail to enable positive identification, there appears to be a marked similarity between the appearance of these objects and that of plastic research balloons in flight. Under changing light and weather conditions, these objects have been known to appear as discs and behave in the manner described in your letter.

In view of the above, it is believed the breakdown experienced by the radio station probably was due to technical difficulties and that the appearance of these objects at this time was purely coincidental.

Your action in writing this Headquarters regarding this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

W. R. CLINGMAN

Dear Sir:

On Friday evening, July 22nd at about 8:45 p.m., my wife and thirteen year old daughter, in company with a young man, were walking on a country road immediately in the rear of our home on the outskirts of Peekskill, New York. They saw two flying discs. I did not see them myself, but have been watching with my camera in hand, hoping to might appear again. I called each one individually into a room and asked tim to describe what they saw. Each one seemed to have seen exactly the same thing.

On the ground it was not quite dark but there were no stars visible in the sky as yet. However, the sun had set beyond the horizon. There was no red sun-set in the sky. The sky was blue with a few scattered clouds. These objects came rolling out of the southeast and traveled northwest. Both discs followed one another in exactly the same track across the sky. The three who saw them were looking in a southerly direction. They described them as follows:

The discs appeared to them to be slightly larger than a full moon. They were pure white and gave the appearance of having concaved depth. They were whirling, or spinning, in the same direction in which they were traveling, and at a terrific speed as if being rolled across the sky. The discs being snow white stood out against a very blue sky. The outer-rounnded edge seemed solid but not sharp, due to the whirling motion. The first disc seerwed to have a bluish shadow in the center or was transparent, but the second one was solid white. They sped across the sky and disappeared behind a white cloud. The folks waited to see them come out of the cloud bank but they did not reappear. Either they dissolved in the cloud, or turned in such a direction that they were obscured by the cloud. They had a rather eerie and awesome effect on the three who witnessed the spectacle.

The young man `******` is the son of our Minister, Reverend Ernest `************` of Portchester, New York and is a concert pianist of considerable reputation. When you know him, you would not doubt his veracity. He was the first to see them and he attracted the attention of my wife and daughter. Most certainly, my wife and thirteen year old daughter would have no reason to prevaricate. All three were out walking a new dog which we recently purchased for our daughter. These three are

willing to give an oath to what they saw.

Another strange thing that has happened: W.L.N.A., our local 
radio station, is located on the hill opposite to where our home
is located. They leave the air at 8:00 p.m., every evening. That
is about 45 minutes before the discs were seen. The cloud into
which they disappeared was almost above the station's antenna.
The station has not been functioning properly. However, it was
supposed to be OK on Saturday morning following the appearance of
the discs.

Yesterday, I had two programs on W.L.N.A. Ordinarily the
station is wonderful; but Sunday something was the matter and
the trouble could not be located. This morning (Monday), they
still have not located the difficulty. One of my broadcasts was
transcribed on a trash tape. We made the recording Friday afternoon and when we immediately played it back, it was perfectly all
right. But when we went on the Air Sunday, it was distorted.
Later, at 6:45 p.m. (Sunday), I had _________
Air in a personal studio appearance. Again the reproduction was
bad on our home radio; according to those who were listening.
At the station, I had asked the engineer to make a tape of our
broadcast and we played it back afterwards and it was also badly
distorted.

My thought in telling you this; could it be possible that these
discs were electrical phenomena of some sort that has magnetized
the station's equipment and tapes, or is it some sort of atomic
energy that is loose and loading things with radio active waves,
or something designed to block radar? This is just a wild guess.
If this same pattern has happened elsewhere, then it might add up
to something.

If you want further information, contact us.

Cordially yours,

Mr. Ben Hibbs, editor
The Saturday Evening Post
Independence Square
Philadelphia 5, Pennsylvania

Dear Sir:

I am sending you a copy of my letter to the Commanding Officer, Technical Intelligence Division, Air Materiel Command Headquarters, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base of Dayton, Ohio. Those are facts. Maybe we've stumbled on to something, however, for safety sake, I suggest you contact the above before using any of this material. Publicity would be bad if these discs are a secret.

I made these photos to let you see this type of people who saw the discs. I asked my folks if they remembered what two discs looked like well enough to draw them or make a clay model. They said "Yes".

I am a Post addict and read your articles on the discs. If you want more information, I will be glad to supply same.

Incidentally, the radio station is back operating, OK. When I suggested that the discs might have caused their difficulty, the Station Manager wanted to know if I might be suffering from a "Saturday hang-over". However, he couldn't tell me what knocked the station out.

Cordially yours,

Executive Secretary
