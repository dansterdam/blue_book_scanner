The image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it shows a scanned page from a document with text and a small graphic representation at the bottom. This representation appears to be a simple drawing or a sketch, possibly associated with the UFO report described in the text. The graphic includes three shapes that seem to resemble the descriptions given in the report (a disk body, an edge, and sparks). Here is the text as an OCR output:

FROM: 7050th A.I.S. Wing REPORT NO. 39092-15-485 C
PLACE: DNIEPROPETROVSK EVALUATION: F - 0
POLITICAL LOCATION: Ukrainskaya SSR

PREAMBLE: From Aug 29 to 15 Oct 49 SOURCE worked as a general laborer in the
building combine K.P.P. DOK. in DNIEPROPETROVSK (48/27 N - 34/59 E) from 1800
hours until 0200 hours. At the beginning of Oct, 49 he observed the following:

Reference is made to Inclosure #1, this report, a memory sketch of missiles
observed flying near DNIEPROPETROVSK, on which SOURCE was able to give details
on the following:
Point #1, BODY. From the distance SOURCE saw the body, it appeared to be a
large disk, the center of which was almost black. It became red towards the
outer edge, but the edge itself appeared to be white hot.

Point #2, FLAMING ARCH. A flaming arch was observed on top of the disk, but the
upper edge of the body could still be seen.

Point #3, SPARKS. Sparks emerged from the edge of the disk, white hot, with
a tail similar to the one of a falling star.

SOURCE observed these missiles 4 nights between 0000 hours and 0200 hours,
describing a wide arch on the southern perimeter, from East to West. The
distance or height was not known to SOURCE. The missile was seen to 1½
minutes, each time. SOURCE heard no noises whatsoever and stated that the
same observations were made by other PWs. To confirm his statement he gave
the address of a fellow PW in AACHEN (50/47 N - 06/17 E) who made the same
observations from another location, but during the same nights.

The image appears to be a sketch rather than a photograph. It depicts a disk-shaped object with lines to indicate movement or energy emanating from it. The sketch has three labels (e.g., "1.", "2.", "3."), but the corresponding descriptions for these numbers are not visible in the image. Below the sketch, there is a caption that reads:

The Source, ███████ while interned in Pi camp 7786/10 A, was
working as a handyman in an auto repair shop at Moscow (55/45 N - 37/35 E).

Reference is made to inclosure #1, this report, a memory sketch of an
unknown flying object which was observed by Source while he was interned in Pi
camp 7786/10 A at Moscow. Source observed the object on two occasions. The
first time, he worked at a marshalling yard where he unloaded construction
material from freight cars, pinpointed as point #1, inclosure #1, report #827 A.
The second time, he saw the object from his place of work at Ts AVIAVO on the nor-
thern outskirts of Moscow, when he worked as a handyman on the construction of
an apartment building, pinpointed as point #3, inclosure 1, report #827 A.
The area over which the object was seen is pinpointed as point #3, inclosure #1,
report #827 A, which was restricted to the best, of Source's memory. Source
could not give a description of the area as he was too far away from it, both
times the object was seen above the same site. The attention of the P's at
work was attracted to the object when suddenly a fellow P exclaimed: "Look,
there is that over there in the sky." When looking in the direction in which
the PW was pointing, Source got sight of an unknown flying object which he had never
seen, and of which he had never heard before. The Russian workers were as sur-
prised as the German PWs and discussed what it could be. They could not find
an answer to it, and were of the opinion that it was something new and that it
had nothing to do with a meteorological station. As there was no advertising in
Russia, it was impossible that it was something of that kind, especially as the
strange arrangement of the parts of this object would not have been of any sense
for advertising. Source stated that there were cumulus clouds in the sky the
first time he saw the object. He estimated that the object had an altitude of
about 5,000 meters, judging from its distance from the surface of the earth and

The image does not contain any photographs. It features a text document with the heading "CONFIDENTIAL" in large letters at the top, and the text is arranged in a typical paragraph format with typewritten text. At the bottom of the page, there are classifications marks "UNCLASSIFIED" with a stamp that also includes "DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS DOD DIR 5200.10".

from the clouds. Later on he admitted that his estimation may not have been
accurate and that it may have been only 2,000 meters as it was hard for him
to estimate that. The second time he saw the object, the sky was not overcast,
merely a few clouds were to be seen in the blue sky. He estimated that the
flying object may have been about 5,000 to 3,000 meters away from his point
of observation. Source described the object as being one vertical rod above
which five spherical items were arranged in the way as is shown on inclosure
1, this report, perspective and top view. From his point of observation the
flying rod had the size of a pencil but may have been about 10 meters long and
30 centimeters in diameter if the distance to the object is taken into considera-
tion. In comparison with the diameter of the rod, the spherical items had a
diameter of about three times the diameter of the rod, namely about 90 to 100
centimeters. The spherical items and the rod seemed to have been painted all
white. The items may have been balloons, but Source could not claim that.
Source stated that he saw no antennae or anything else come out of any of the
items. Four of the spherical items were symmetrically arranged about five meters
above the rod in a square, while one spherical item was further away from the
rod. Estimated distances shown in the inclosure should not be relied upon as
they were estimated in relation to the size of the flying items.

On both occasions the object remained motionless for about 10 minutes.
Suddenly it moved away and could be seen by source only for about 10 to 15
seconds until buildings between the object and Source made further observation
impossible. Source could not recall into which direction the object moved.

Source gave the following address of a man who may also have seen the object, 
as he was interned in the same PW camp. He was the former PW [redacted]
[redacted], who was released at HERFSELD transit camp in Dec 1949.

An interrogator of this office stated to the writer of this report that
he read an article about the flying object in a US newspaper in about Feb or
Apr 1945. The article reported on the same object which was seen by Allied
pilots over Germany towards the end of World War II. They were observed in
flight beside German airplanes.

Both the interviewer and the assisting AFLO officer agreed that the man
had seen something and that his statements should be taken to be reliable,
essentially as Source was rather serious about everything concerning this
unknown object.
