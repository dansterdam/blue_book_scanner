UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #67 -- near Placerville, California -- 14 August 1947

If details of the observers' statement are accurate, 
it would be difficult to assign an astronomical origin to the
object seen in this incident. There are a few statements which,
taken alone, strongly suggest that a meteor was observed: high
rate of speed, "seemed to be in a shallow dive," white smoke trail, 
"disappeared in a puff of dark gray smoke." However, unless the
description of the object (4-6 feet long and 14-14 inches wide)
and the estimated distance (less than 1000 feet)-are illusory,
this meteoric explanation will not hold.

UNCLASSIFIED
1030 hours 13 August 1947

Telephone message received from Mr. [REDACTED], City Editor, [REDACTED].

Mr. [REDACTED] Editor, [REDACTED], with an impressive
executive with the [REDACTED] of [REDACTED] of Sacramento, reported the
following incident:

At appx. 14:30P, on August 14, while driving on Cedar Spring Road, 4 to 5
miles southeast of Placerville, Calif., he, accompanied by his wife, observed
a "flying disc" about 200 ft from 50 to 100 ft. Closer observation revealed a
piece of "shiny metal," approximately 5000 feet above moving at a "high 
rate of speed." The object appeared to be highly polished and was disc
shaped. It appeared to be approximately 5 feet in length and was tilted
in a semi-circle.

The object struck the ground with a "puff" of black smoke" about 100
feet below the top of a hill which was approximately 700 feet ahead of the
automobile driven by the observer. An inward, outward explosion, inversion-
ation of the location where the object was observed to have landed.

The observer is able to identify the location where the object was
observed to land.

(Mr. [REDACTED] is a University of California graduate, and is personally
known by members of the Oakland Tribune staff. He is a brother-in-law of
of the entire hospital of Southern California.)

The document seems to be related to the investigation of what is described as "flying discs," a term often associated with unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and it is addressed to a military command structure. The poor quality of the scan renders parts of the text unreadable.

Observer first noticed a wide smoke trail and while searching for its source
he saw an object a long to ft. in length 10 to 14 inches wide and of metal color
which gave off a very bright reflection like highly polished aluminum.
It was first observed at 1050 position to the automobile. Upon reaching a 1200
position it was engulfed in a puff of dark gray smoke about 10 ft in diameter.
There was a change in the color of the smoke. The object was traveling at a
terrific speed and seemed to be on a swallow dive. When the puff of smoke
appeared the object disappeared completely. No particles were observed falling
nor from it. Fire point of disappearance seemed to be about 800 yards in front
of Observer, the base was not possibly of being hidden by vegetation or terrain.
It appeared rectangular for the most part, but once it appeared to have a very
slightly curved top surface. It seemed more like a rocket than disc like.
It seemed, tilted in a semi circle.

NOTE:
Agent notes the point of observation would afford a sweeping view thru 400
of the canyon and the south side of Weber Creek.
Agent was not definite as to what part of the field of view he had seen the
object and indicated that it could have been as far as the horizon.).
No object, gas or particles therefrom visible. In the six square mile area of wooded
mountingnous terrain full of canyons and ravines.

Agent thought that witness could have seen a conventional type of air-
craft which due to the distance from which it was observed,presented no dist-
inguishing features for the short period it was observed, however agent could not
account for the smoke trail.
