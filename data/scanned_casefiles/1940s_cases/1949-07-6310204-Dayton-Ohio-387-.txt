The image depicts a page with most of the text redacted with black markings, leaving very little visible text. There is a simple line drawing on the right side of the page. The drawing appears to be a diagram representing a shape that could be interpreted as a craft, possibly a UFO, with annotated parts. There are lines pointing to various features of the drawn shape with notes.

Unfortunately, due to the redaction, it is not possible to apply OCR to most of the content, as the text is obscured. Here is the text that is visible and not redacted:

- [3,000]
- Dayton, Ohi.
- Dayton
- Evidence Officen - Case B.
- .23137

All other potentially informative text has been blacked out and is therefore unreadable. The handwritten notes next to the drawing mention "Base", "Yellow", a measurement of "15 ft", and "Center of attraction magnetism??", though the exact context of these notes is unclear due to the lack of surrounding text.

PROJECT "GRUDGE"

DETAILS:

1. This investigation predicated upon Routing and Record Sheet from the Acting Chief, Analysis Division, Intelligence Department, IC/AXS, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, dated 14 July 1949, confirmed telephone call from Mr. [REDACTED] on 11 July 1949, requesting investigation of the sighting of an aerial object at approximately 1915 hours on 10 July 1949 in the vicinity of 431 East Stroop Road, Dayton, Ohio.

AT DAYTON, OHIO

2. On 21 July 1949, Mrs. [REDACTED] of Dayton, Ohio, was interviewed and stated in substance that at approximately 1915 hours on 10 July 1949, while sitting in her yard, she observed an object in the southeast which looked like a kite. Subsequent examination of the object through a pair of binoculars confirmed the belief that same was a kite, even though she did not see neither the string nor the tail. According to Mrs. [REDACTED] the kite seemed to be drifting with the wind but was not moving a great deal. The object maintained its general direction until it became dark to see it.

3. Mrs. [REDACTED] and Mrs. [REDACTED] of Dayton, Ohio, were interviewed on 21 July 1949 and substantiated the above information. In addition, both interviewees advised that they had discussed this matter with their husbands and if present their husbands would volunteer the same information.

4. Mr. [REDACTED] and Mr. [REDACTED] were interviewed on 26 July 1919 relative to the predicating information. Informants advised that the object was observed through high power binoculars and there was no question in their minds that the object was a box kite. According to informants the string and tail were visible. Both agreed as to time and place of seeing the object. Mr. [REDACTED] added that he observed the same object on 9 July 1949 and it was in the same general direction.

5. On 1 August 1949, Mr. [REDACTED] was interviewed. Mr. [REDACTED] stated in substance that the object was studied by him through binoculars and in his opinion same was a large box kite. Informant agreed as to time and place of seeing the object.

SUBJECT Report of Investigation

TO: AC/1 FROM: _____ DATE: 14July 49 COMMENT NO. 1

1. In compliance with telephone conversation of 11 July 1949 between ___
of ACI and Mr. _____ of ACI/NXS the following information regarding the sighting of an
unidentified aerial phenomena, by Mr. ______ ______, Dayton, Ohio is
submitted.

2. _____ was interviewed at his office (ACKNOWLEDGED) _____ stated that while standing
in his yard at approximately 1915 hours, 10 July 1949 his attention was attracted to a
yellowish object in the N.E. sky at a 30-45 degree elevation. As first the object
appeared disc shaped but upon closer examination thru binoculars it appeared to be two
objects connected together. The front or foremost object appeared as a yellow diamond
with a black spot in the center. This in turn was connected by cable or rope to a t with
yellow disc or oval object in the rear. The length to Width ratio appeared to be 5:1 or
roughly the size of the first two joints of the index finger held at arms length. In
the absence of any known aerial objects on which to base a comparison the observer was
unable to make a reliable estimate as to size, altitude or or [sic] distance from observer,
however, a guess was offered that this object may have been slightly larger than an F80 at an
altitude of 1000 feet and at a distance of three miles. The object was under observation
for a period of 15 minutes and was still in view when observer left scene. During this
period no movement of object was noticed.

3. The observer also mentioned reporting this matter to the airdrome office, Area
"B." A check of the log at the office of the airdrome officer indicates this report
was received at 1915 and what a check with the control tower to determine if they had
witnessed this object yielded a negative reply.

4. Interview of other witness to this incident are being conducted by other intelli-
gence agencies and their reports will be submitted upon receipt.

5. Project Grudge is unable to offer a logical explanation for this incident on the
basis of information submitted to date.
