Jan 5 1949

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
Andrews Air Force Base,
Washington 25, D. C.
AFN: DSS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sightings of unidentified flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the files of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendation as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. This Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are scheduled by the Intelligence Department of this Command. Those schedules are made direct from the JOP or through our office, MCIAO-3. Those manually actioned most of the charts of synoptic balloon flights made by weather service stations of the, Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce. (U.S. Weather Bureau) regulated Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed incidents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining incidents are balloons.

The image provided does not contain a photograph. It is a typed document, and the text from the document is as follows:

"A yellow-orange object which had the appearance of a flare was observed some six
miles from Smyrna AAF between the west and northwest just above the horizon
and moving directly to the base. The speed was such as to cover the
six miles in approximately four to five minutes. It gradually faded away
disappearing into the horizon. No exhaust trail was seen and no sound was heard."
