Incident io. 21 -- 2 June 1947, 1615, Des Moines, Iowa.
The observer, a bus driver, reported observing thirteen objects at 1000 ft
altitude, traveling in a straight line in file at 300 mph. The objects were
elliptical in form "inverted saucers", 12 ft thick, 175-230 ft in diameter,
dirty white, and made a sound like an electric motor or dynamo. There was
no further information supplied except that the observer stated they looked
like dots in the sky.

ATC Opinion: These objects were seen just outside Des Moines, and were
flying toward Des Moines. If they were not ordinary objects mistaken for some-
thing else by the observer, but were really unusual aircraft, it seems almost
certain that someone else would have also reported them. There is insufficient
information for a proper analysis.

Here is the text available on the document:

---
Incident #21 --- Des-Moines, Iowa --- 29 June 1947

There is no obvious astronomical explanation for this
incident.

If the estimate of size can be given any credence at all,
the objects could not have been farther than five miles away; this
is an absolute upper limit, and objects probably were very much
closer.

It appears that there is no photograph in the image you've provided. The document is a scanned text page, and it's quite faded which makes it challenging to read. However, I will do my best to transcribe what is visible:

The image you've provided does not contain any photographs. It’s a page of text, presumably from a report. Here is the text contained in the document:

---

With 204 incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirteen which contain some evidence but have no apparent sound explanation.
The evidence is not only on the basis of the assertion that the objects observed are reliable and accurate, these typically occur and physical traces or more often at an angle where optical or acoustic effects of the atmosphere, etc, are non-effective. It is in this instance that pilots of TWA witnessed a large unconventional aircraft (see App A)*

6. “Atmospherical Optical Anomalies” Laboratory Reports
(Incident considered)

- that a sufficient psychological explanation for the unidentified flying objects to provide plausible explanation for events not otherwise explainable. These errors in identifying will include results chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, size.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in this report, these incidents from no pattern in regard to area or static types of objects, or manner of performance. There are indicators, however, that a growing have been influenced by earlier reports, probably no two have been described unusual, or reported as been no publicity.

PROJECTS CHANGE
C. Study of Case Foundation of Remaining Reports

VIII. Summary of A.F.C Evaluation of Remaining Reported

The term ‘unexplained incidents’ (see Appendix II) refers to not common characteristics. No one time, or statements of the group which had not been made, has the witnesses not read of what occurred (Translator to l7). Tests were complicated without pattern throughout the United States, a few were outside the U.S. No two descriptions or appearance or performance were exactly alike. The reports of sightings occurred at various times of day and year.

APPENDIX X

In the following section of this report, each remaining unexplained incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to generalize as to the behavior of observers, but each case has undesirable elements, and hence is considered. Individual consideration is rarely the category of the incident in the project’s files.
