STATEMENT                                            UNCLASSIFIE

At approximately 5:45 P.M., on 28 April 1949 I sighted an object in the 
sky NE of Tuscon, Arizona, just over the rim of the Catalina Mountains. This 
object was very brilliant, appeared to be reflecting the sun shine. From 
my point of observation, this object was sighted at approximately a 
30 degree angle of elevation and I would judge it to be at that time about 
300 miles NE of Tuscon. This object was in sight for approximately 2 minutes 
after which time it disappeared to the SW, just suddenly fading from view 
in the distance. It appeared to be traveling in a curved trajectory, but 
I believe this to be deceptive, traveling in a straight line and from my point of 
observation, the illusion was curved. I would judge this object to be traveling 
in excess of 500 miles an hour at an altitude from 5 to 10 miles up. 
It appeared to assume like in shape, with no fins, wings or protuberances 
of any sort. It seemed to be revolving similar to a slow roll of the sun? 
It was most visible when it reached a position where it reflected a strong 
light, it was also evident upon shine of the object when no reflections were 
visible. From the hight and size of the object in the air, and if it was 
placed on the ground, I would judge it to be the size of a city block. I did 
not hear any noise nor were there any exhaust trails.

I was in the company of Mr. Campbell and Mr. East and the three of us 
were standing in the open car topside area, and hadn't notice me while 
this object was in sight. There were no condensation visible, window or any 
other identifiable marks. The only way I can describe is that it was 
shaped like in shine. I assume that this was not a conventional aircraft 
and to the best of my knowledge and belief I can give no reasonable explanation 
as to exactly what this object was that I saw.

STATEMENT

UNCLASSIFIED

At 5:15 P. M. on 28 April 1949 I sighted an object NW of Tucson, Arizona at an angle of 75 degrees from the horizontal and at an altitude of about 25,000 to 30,000 feet. I noticed this object while standing in front of the Circle W. Ranch near the corner of East Hedrick and North Campbell Avenues, at 2218 East Hedrick Drive, I first noticed it because of the reflection of the sun on the object which showed it a brilliant silver color. When I first sighted the object it was traveling in a southeastly direction and finally curved to the northwest and disappeared from view. I observed it for about 40 minutes.

This object was cigar shaped with rounded ends. Had no tail assembly or fins that I could see. It seemed to be rotating as it traveled. I would say it was traveling at a high rate of speed. There were no clouds, and the sky was very clear. Toward the front of the object I noted two circular holes which looked just likes eyes from that distance.

I did not hear any noise nor note any exhaust or vapor trails.

From its altitude I would say it would be as large as a B-29.

I was in company with two other men. One man's name was Ham and the other man was called Tex.

I called Davis-Monthan AFB and talked to the S. O. D., who was on duty that evening.

STATEMENT

At about 5:30 P. M. on the night of 28 April 1949, I noted an object in the sky northwest of where I reside which traveled in a southeast-ward direction and gradually turned to the southwest and disappeared from sight. I would judge this object to be at an angle of 60 degrees and from 4 to 5 miles high.

This object seemed oval in shape and when it caught the sun's rays it was a brilliant silvery color. When I first observed this object it seemed to turn over and disappeared for awhile. I noticed it again a few minutes later again much farther south of my first observation.

I noted no exhaust or vapor trails. It made no noise. I could see no lights, wings or tail surfaces, I have noticed B—29's passing overhead but this seemed to travel much faster.

Looking at this object as I did for at least a half hour it seemed to be 5 or 6 feet long and I would say it would be 20 to 25 feet long if it was on the ground.

When I observed this object I was in company with a man named [REDACTED] another named [REDACTED], who I believe works in a florist shop somewhere on the east side.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY

At approximately 5:45 P.M. on 23 April 1949, I sighted an object in the air NE of Tucson, Arizona, just over the rim of the Catalina mountains. This object was very bright and appeared to be reflecting the sunshine. From my points of observation, this object was first sighted at approximately a 90 degree angle of elevation, and I would judge it to be at that time about 300 miles NE of Tucson. This object was first sightly approximately 12 minutes after which time it disappeared suddenly, just as calmly blinking your eye in the distance. I watched standing in a curved trajectory, but I believe this object was traveling in a straight line and from my point of observation, the illusion was curved. I would judge this object to be travelling in excess of 100 miles an hour at an altitude of from 5 to 10 miles up. It appeared to be saucer-like in shape, with no fins, wings or protuberances of any sorts. It seemed to be revolving similar to a slow roll of an airplane. It was most visible when it reached a position were it reflected the sun's rays, but it also could be seen when its face was turned away from the sun. From the time and site of the object in the air, so it's actions over this period, I would judge it to be the size of a city block. I did not hear any noise nor was there any exhaust or vapor trails.

I was in the company of Mr. [redacted] and [redacted], and the three of us were standing near the corner of [redacted] Drive while this object was in sight. There were no openings visible, windows or any other identifiable marks. The only way I can describe it is that it was saucer-like in shape, and since this was not a conventional aircraft nor to the best of my knowledge a balloon, I can give no reasonable explanation as to exactly what this object was as I saw it.

Considered reliable, but ability to observe averages fair.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

At 5445 P.M. on 23 April 1949, I sighted an object NE of Tucson, Arizona
at an angle of 75 degrees from the horizontal and at an altitude of about 25,000
to 30,000 feet. I noticed this object while standing in front of the Circle K.
Ranch near the corner of East Hadlock and North Campbell Ave., at 2215 East Hadlock
Drive. It first appeared like one of the bright, white stars on the objects which
showed a brilliant silvery color. Then I sighted this object, it was trav-
eling in a south-easterly direction, and finally curved to the southwest and disappeared
from view. I observed it for about 10 minutes.

This object was cigar shaped with rounded ends. had no tail assembly or wings
that I could see. It seemed to be rotating as it traveled. I would also say it was
traveling at a high rate of speed. There were no clouds, and the sky was very clear.
toward the front of the object, I noted two regular holes which looked just like
eyes from that distance.

I did not hear any noise or notice any exhaust or vapor trails.

From its altitude, I would say it would be as large as a B-29.

I was in company with two other men. One man's name was [Redacted] and the other
man was called [Redacted].

I called Davis-Monthan AFB and talked to the S.O.D. who was on duty that
evening.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

At about 1530 P.M. on the night of 23 April 1949, I noted an object in the
sky northeast of where I reside, which traveled in a southwesterly direction, and
eventually turned to the southwest and disappeared from sight. I would judge this
object to be at an angle of 50 degrees and from 4 to 5 miles high.

This object seemed oval in shape and when it caught the sun's rays, it was
a brilliant silvery color. When I first observed this object, it seemed to turn over
and disappeared for awhile. I noticed it again a few minutes later much farther
south of my first observations.

I noted no exhaust or vapor trails. It made no noise. I could see no lights,
wings or tail surfaces. I have noticed B-29's flying high overhead, but this seemed
to travel much faster.

Looking at this object as I did for at least a half hour, it seemed to be 5
or 6 feet long, and I would say it would be 20 to 25 feet long if it was on the ground.

When I observed this object, I was in company with a man named ____ and
another named ____ who I believe works _______________________________ east edge.
