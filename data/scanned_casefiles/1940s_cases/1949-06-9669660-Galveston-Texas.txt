On 26 July 1947, Mr. **[redacted]**, age about (25) **[several words redacted]** Dalhart, Texas, stated that on two reperate **[sic]** occasions he and several boys of approximately **[redacted]** to twelve years, saw a flying disk, described as a gray, large saucer like, come into view and on one of the group drew to his attention an article in the Saturday Evening Post entitled "What You Can Always About Flying Saucers" which stated in part about how to impress the boys he reflected a flashlight onto a layer of varied shaped glass and object similar to to **[sic]** Smoky Hill where a similar object in 1948 became, on a challenge from the boys, known later to be the director of the Saturday Evening ***[text unreadable due to quality of scan]*** from articles in newspapers and magazines.

STATEMENT

                          July 5, 1949

     I, _____________, residing at ____________, 
County of __________, State of ____________, ______ to special 
questions asked me while in the custody of the CIC voluntarily and with-
out coercion; duress, without bribery, promise or promise of lenien-
cy; upon advice have advised me of my rights that I do not have to 
make any statements oral or written.

     I wish to make the following statement in reference to a letter 
I wrote on 4 March 1949 to the editor of the Saturday Evening Post,
wherein I had stated that around midship during the early part of 
June 1948 I had observed an object flying at terrific speed which 
resembled a flying saucer, and at this time I want to deny the above 
mentioned statement and state it is untrue.

     On the third of March 1949 several boys of my age brought to 
my attention an article, "What you can believe about Flying Saucers",
in the Saturday Evening Post and I in turn made up this story, purely 
of my own imagination, and from information that I had learned by 
reading several articles in regards to flying saucers, as a dare I 
wrote this latter. while at this beach I had not seen or observed 
anything that resembled a flying saucer. The diagram and descrip-
tion which I enclosed in my letter to the editor of The Saturday 
Evening Post where simply copies of diagrams I had seen in other 
publications.

     I hereby state the foregoing statements made and written in this
statement consisting of four pages written in my own handwriting are
to the best of my knowledge and belief, true and accurate.
