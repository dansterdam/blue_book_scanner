Page 2 Incident: ____
Name and Addre.e of Observer:

Description and method:

Source of Information: Airfield-Suisun AFB, Calif
                       Control Tower Operator
                       FFC, USAF
Reliability of Source: Considered fully reliable and a competent airman. Sighting
also witnessed by [REDACTED] Sgt AF [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] OIC
considers them high type individuals fully qualified both mentally and
physically for control tower duty. Considered competent, reliable observers
psychologically stable.

OBJECT IN SIGHT:

Object first got into view about 2 miles north of the Control Tower
flying at low altitude between 500 & 4000 ft, climbing on a low trajectory
with a speed estimated in excess of 1000 MPH. Immediately after sighting 
[REDACTED] remained to east side of tower. By this time object was estimated
to be not more than 1500 feet altitude and its speed had slowed for several
seconds to perhaps 200 MPH. At this state object had a very slight undulating
or bouncing motion. When in position oriented with the Line between the
tower and the air freight terminal, but a slight distance east of the terminal,
the object took off almost vertical rise or climb and leveled off again
at an estimated 3000 ft. At this point [REDACTED]
watching as PFC [REDACTED] attempted to summon the AACS operations Officer.
Sgt [REDACTED] reported the object almost immediately afterward started a
fast climb toward the south-southeast and reached about 20,000 ft at which
point he lost sight of it. PVT [REDACTED] never saw the object again after
leaving to phone.

Object was viewed thru 8-power binoculars, All that could be seen was a
circular light one to 2 feet in diameter. It had the intensity of a Ramp
floodlight and was so bright that it blanked out any silhouette (if any)
when sighted in binoculars. In size it was comparable to one of Fairfield-
Suisun AFB's high-intensity runway lights. No sound was herd nor was
any exhaust trail observed. The light was clearly seen with the naked eye
It was brilliant but by no means blinding. Observer (PVC [REDACTED]), was
convinced it was not an aircraft's navigation light. The night was clear,
and the wind indicated southwest at 10 MPH on tower instruments. A weather
balloon had been released 45 to 35 minutes previous to sighting but was
lost ten minutes after release.

The text is not fully clear due to its poor quality, and there are several sections that are illegible or only partially readable. The document mentions a report of an unidentified object sighting by an Air Force B-29 bomber, mentions of specific measurements and directions, and descriptions of speeds and altitudes. There's also a reference to weather balloon sizes and visibility conditions. However, the complete content and context cannot be discerned from the provided information.

climbing slowly at 100 MPH; at 1500 ft it slowed for a few seconds to

STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED 12 January 1949

At the request of Chief of Intelligence, this undersigned wishes to describe as accurately as possible his impressions of the brief appearance of an unknown illuminated object which appeared over Fairfield-Suisun AFB at 2025 PST on 3 December 1948. The object first into view about 2 miles north of the control tower, flying at a low altitude between 500 and 1000 feet, climbing on a low trajectory, with a speed estimated at something in excess of 400 miles per hour. Immediately after sighting, this observer rushed to the east side of the tower. By this time the object was estimated to have not more than 1500 feet altitude and it's speed had slowed to several seconds to perhaps two-hundred (200) miles per hour. The observer can recall that a this stage the object had a very slight undulating or bouncing motion. When in this position overhead with a line between the tower and the air freight terminal, but a slight distance east of the terminal, the object took an almost vertical rise or climb and levellal off again at an estimated three thousand feet. At that time the other control-tower operator on duty continued watching, raised the lights in observatian throgh the AACS binoculars of the object on this business he reported that the object, upon motion checking with the operations be so that he might be able to get a look at it. The other tower operator reported the object last immediately afterwards started at a crash climb toward the south-southeast and reached about twenty thousand feet, at which point he lost sight of it. The undersigned never saw the object again after going for the telephone.

Pertinent information is that the light was clearly seen with the naked eye, brilliant but by no means blinding. In size it was comparable to one Traffic-field-sun AFB's high-intensity runway lights. The observer is convinced it was not an aircraft navigation light. The night was clear, and the wind was indicating southwest at 10 miles per hour on tower instruments.

I certify and affirm that the information herein is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and ability.
