Gentlemen:
"FLying Suacers"

A fitly recant article in the Post stated your wish for reports
on this dream-world business. Last summer I saw something for
which I had and have no reasonable explanation. With no further
apologies, I'll just report as I remember the event.

I deparated, alone, from Woodrum at Roanoke, Virginia for Chilhowie
AP - shortly after sunset in July or August 1948. The flight was
without mishap and unevent until some point between Wytheville and
Marion. The Bellanca Cruisair was indicating about 145 - light
was on the bottom of the peak indication. I was about 1500 - 
about 1500' above the ridge that was to my right - perhaps 2000' -
otherwise, without chart reference, I cannot state altitude except
a guess at 6500'.

To my left, at about 10 o'clock, I saw a light. My very first
reaction was that it was the highlight of a locomotive. It was
obvious that it was not as it appeared to be moving, at the speed
of light slower than mine and in my direction - along the side of.
the ridge that mskes the other side of the valley along which I
It had the brilliance of a locomotive headlight, at not halfway head
on. From my place of observation, this light was between me and
the top of the opposite ridge.

I looked for flying lights and saw none. The light did not flash
or emit color like the tail light of a commercial carrier and it had
greater brilliance than I'd attribute to such a light. The light
source appeared to be several times the size than I'd attribute to
such a tail light.

My next reaction was that I was not seeing it. In which case all
lights within cabin the light was still there. Wind glasses -
still thero, Rocked wings - the light did not rock with me. 
It gave the indelible impression that it was the not unlikey curiosity.
What was that? I held not it was probable the moon down from the light
was closer to my level. Probably that increased indicated AS to
165. I appeared to have in increased slightly.

Faced, it appeared to take off at very good way less than sixteened
its speed at well over 300. It lost some altitude - in accordance

with my observation.

At Marion there is a break in the ridge that was to my left. There
lay another valley.

My light appeared to make a turn up this other valley - a turn whose
radius did not appear to be out of proportion to invariant speed.

Thatrs all I saw of it - although I looked up the valley as I came
to it; soon after. I felt that I should have seen it.

Naturally, it occurred to me that it might have been an aircraft.
As it seemed that the crafts light went on to beam turned off after
the turn and that the light then went on toward Bristol, after having
made a nother turn, I inquired at Chilhowie if they had sighted such
a light or had seen an aircraft. They had not. I didn’t press
the subject as I found it slightly embarrassing.

That's all. It didn't look like a disc or a square. I saw no
shape. The was were no orange or red lights, I saw no exhaust.
It was not a weird looking light. It didn't strike me. it just
provoked my curiosity - but not to the extent of chasing it.

I don't recall being tired or weary. This was my first experience
at seeing something what probably aint. I'm not troubled with
dreams. I was very sure, at the time, that I was seeing something
as described and still feel I saw it. But, there is no reasonable
explanation for a light to behave in its manner. That is - I find
no reason for its being there.

Neither can I say that it is a cause for alarm. Any foreign power
would be nuts to test a craft that way.

                                                         Yours very truly,
