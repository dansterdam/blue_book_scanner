Lewiston, Idaho
July 25, 1949

Base Intelligence Officer
Spokane Air Force Base
Spokane, Washington

Dear Sir:

This letter is to inform you of possible aircraft over Lewiston last night. It is probably useless information but after reading the Associated Press report of a Boise pilot seeing "flying objects" over southern Idaho yesterday, I decided to send you this report anyway.

I am a weather observer at the Weather Bureau Office at the Lewiston Municipal Airport. Was on duty yesterday from 1600P to 2400P. About 2310P I went outside to see if there were any clouds in the sky. The sky was clear. As I was about to go back inside I heard a faint noise. It sounded like a formation of several aircraft at high altitude west of the airport. The noise increased and decreased in volume intermittently, as if they were circling. After about five minutes of this the noise faded gradually and I returned to the office. While listening I was also looking for aircraft lights but saw none. If there were any it probably would have been easy to miss them against the background of bright stars, and as I said before, the noises seemed to come from a high altitude.

I have told nobody, except in this letter, about what I heard and do not intend to tell anybody. Also I will not tell anybody about this letter.

In case you are interested, here is my military experience: Served with the AAF from Feb. 12, 1942 to March 1, 1946. Was a Weather Forecaster, A.I.O.S. 787, T/Sgt., A.S.N.

If you have any questions about this, I will be glad to cooperate with you in any way possible.

Yours very truly,

1. Forwarded herewith, in compliance with your request of 27 July
1949, are seven (7) spark plugs which were taken from Aircraft Number
N5622A, a Piper "Clipper" on 25 July 1949. The eighth spark plug from
this aircraft had been thrown away and could not be located.

2. Subject aircraft had on 2 July at 1203 hours (lST) been ap-
proached within 1500 feet by seven (7) unidentified aerial objects,
according to Mr. --------- of Mountain Home, Idaho, who was flying
subject aircraft at time of incident. As soon as Mr. --------- flew his;
aircraft through the flight path of the objects, he states that his
engine began running rough. Upon landing, Mr. --------- had plane in-
spected and found that all the spark plugs from the Lycoming engine which
powers his plane, had been shorted, and that the insulation of the plugs
had been broken down. Mr. --------- states that his plane and engine are
new, and have less than 20 hours time.

3. A complete report of Mr. --------- account of the incident is presently
enroute to your office through District Headquarters, 16th District.

4. The plugs which are forwarded herewith, were removed from
aircraft about 1600 hours (lST) 21 July 1949, and were thrown into a
trash can where they remained until 1630 hours (lST) 25 July 1949. From
1630 hours, 25 July 1949, subject plugs were kept in the container in
which they are herewith forwarded.

There are no photographs in this image. Here is the text output from the document:

---

(5) Speed: Faster than an F-51 and estimated by Mr. to be at least six (6) hundred miles per hour.

(6) Heading: Mr. reported that when first sighted the formation was heading approximately two (3) hundred degrees. The formation passed by him and then made a one hundred and eighty (180) degree turn to approximately one hundred and twenty (120) degrees.

(7) Maneuverability: Mr. reported that no maneuvers were noted other than the one hundred and eighty (180) degree turn. The objects did not appear to bank during the turn. When the objects were first sighted and before the one hundred and eighty (180) degree turn was made, the outer wing surfaces appeared to move slightly.

(8) Altitude: Mr. reported the formation between eight (8) thousand five (5) hundred and ten (10) thousand feet. When the formation was first sighted Mr. was cruising at ten (10) thousand feet and the objects were slightly below and one-fourth (1/4) of a mile to the left of his position. When the formation made the one hundred and eighty (180) degree turn Mr. descended to eight (8) thousand five (5) hundred feet and was below the formation when they came back.

(9) Sound: No sound was noted from the formation.

(10) Exhaust trail or not: No exhaust trail was visible.

6. General remarks: Mr. was enroute from Burley, Idaho, to Nampa, Idaho, in a Cub Cruiser when the objects were sighted. When the formation was first sighted they were going in approximately the same direction as Mr. and were approximately one-fourth (1/4) of a mile to his left and below. Mr. was cruising at ten (10) thousand feet at this time. He observed the formation until it made the one hundred and eighty (180) degree turn at which time Mr. descended in his aircraft and made a ninety (90) degree turn to the left in an effort to intercept the formation. He was able to get below the level of the formation at eight (8) thousand five (5) hundred feet at which time he noticed the dark circular bulye on the bottom side of the objects. Because of their speed the flying objects soon became lost from the sight of Mr. who proceeded on to his destination. Mr. who states that in his opinion Mr. is a reliable witness.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
          _______verbal account of his sighting was as follows: On 24 July 1949, _______,
was flying his Piper Clipper aircraft (N5622H), from Ogden, Utah en route to ______, Idaho.
was 270 about 1205 hours (MST), was flying at 10,000 feet MSL altitude, with
a heading of about 270 degrees, ten (10) miles from ______, Idaho, when he sighted seven (7)
flying objects at about 7 o'clock, (nose of his plane used as 12 o'clock for this
reference), flying the parallel course, but about 500 feet lower. For an instant as
he had his plane at his left shoulder (he was flying alone in a single cockpit Piper
aircraft), and the objects turned out to be about 25-26 feet across. _____ also
knew that they were right; that he had over 4000 hours. The objects overtook his
aircraft, passing on his left (south side) at about 500 feet distance, at approximately
500 feet lower, or 9500 feet MSL altitude. The objects were flying perfect formation,
to - rows of three (line abreast) and the seventh slightly to the rear about
slightly above the rest. The distance that the formation was vy tight, being about
one-third of the object's span extended from tip of one object to tip of the other
(approximately 15 feet). The same distance was maintained from trailing edge of lead
objects to nose of objects in second line. When the objects had passed
craft, they made a turn to the right, passing about 1500 feet in front of, and 500
feet below ______ the objects again turned to the right, and passed on the right
(north) side of _______banked or skidded. The objects made perfect formation turns, and
in so doing they neither gained or did the objects disturbed that when the objects first
turned, he thought they meant to ram him. As soon as the objects passed to his right,
______ turned his aircraft so that he might keep the objects in view. He stated that
the objects remained in view for approximately 1 or 2 minutes _____ and that their
speed was estimated between 450 and 550 miles an hour.
the objects suddenly disappear at approximately ten (10) miles distance from him.

        In describing the objects, _____ said they were delta shaped flying wings to
estimated their span as being between that of an F-51 and an A-26 aircraft (35. 55
feet), & their length (nose to trailing edge) at about 20 to 30 feet, and their
thickness from 2 to 5 feet. _____said that the objects were light color except
for a circle or dark color or approximately 12 feet in diameter which was placed
midway between th tips of the object, and which extended to the trailing edge of the

stated. First estimated that speed of the objects as somewhere btween 550 and 650 miles per hour; then stated that they were traveling not quite that fast. Also to the fact that the circle in the center of the objects changed color slightly from time to time, and that the oscillation or movement of the outer panels was down to about 30 degrees, then to a flush position. stated that he had a good view from all angles except below and to the left.

stated that as he passed th. flight path of the objects he expected a great amount of turbulence, ant that he was surprised when he felt nothing. as soon as he had passed the objects' flight path, however, he noticed that his engine began running rough. stated and engine are brand new.
