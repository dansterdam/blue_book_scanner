Mr. *******
Vice President & Chief Engineer

Dear Mr. *******

Receipt of your letter, dated 9 June 1949, which has been for-
warded this headquarters is respectfully acknowledged.

Although the information submitted by your letter does not
contain sufficient detail to definitely establish the identity of
the object sighted, there is a marked similarity between the descrip-
tion submitted and that of several similar phenomena commonly referred
to as bodies of fire balls. Further research on this subject at the
Local Public Library should confirm or deny this hypothesis.

This explanation would not hold true for the second object
mentioned if as inferred the object was under observation for a
period of 5 to 10 minutes.

Your action in reporting this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

W. E. CLINGEMAN
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Analysis Division

Washington, D.C.

Attention; Mr. Victory Knezevich

Gentlemen;

The following information is given primarily for
the purpose of soliciting a possible answer to observations made
over the last year and which the writer prevails will not be immediately
pursued as representing flying saucers or other unidentified
aestivations of foreign origin. The question has frequently
been put by the public and others in connection with the similar
observations reported in the Press; that "they" have frequently
been observed by others and in all probability may be accounted for
by routine flights of jet planes.

The writer operates a small astronomical observatory
which contains a unit with 3-1/2 inch dual element lens for
photographic recording. Specifically, a year ago in April
1948 a disk observed high in the sky at about appeared in the
southwest and across the sky in a northeasternly direction at a
speed of something like 1 per second. This object appeared to be
about twice the size of Mars and was yellowish and in color and
elliptical, though rather fuzzy in appearance. The said object
appeared to be followed by a trail. It appeared photographic equipment
was not in readiness to record its true motion thru the sky.

It was not mastered time, motion nor
was too slow and I did not, have state of aerial unusual which
usually accompanies such an object. At that time it was assumed
that it might be one of planes testing flights. A panel of the
major planes and the thing was set aside only as a recorded story.

Matters recently, however, a friend sending an
enquiry of the above, other peoples reported that one of the 
plain news media that flew what was as a meteorite. Below
is a direct quote from a column. 

"................

................

................

"Experienced it said to watch with over thoughts come that the
meteor was an aviation saucer, but the asters of anything these
opinions, none of that what we call the associated in any way with
the what national defence program"

Mr. T. F. Victory
2 4.

No estimate could be made of linear velocity or
altitude since no sound from the object was in evidence which
would indicate conventional aircraft.

This letter is written with two things in mind;
namely, to satisfy a natural curiosity and to provide proper authorities
with information concerning the above observation. Bearing this
explanation and the above thoughts observation. Bearing this
reasoning means, the writer is now equipped with phtographic
and have available photographic records if they would be of any
service to interested groups.

Very truly yours,
