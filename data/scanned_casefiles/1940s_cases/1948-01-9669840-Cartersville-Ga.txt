The image contains two black and white illustrations (or depictions) positioned at different angles of the same elongated object with what appears to be fins or wings at one end. The object seems to resemble a classic illustration of some sort of flying craft or missile. There are no photographs contained in the image. 

Here is the text from the document:

---
Incident #242 -- Cartersville, Georgia -- 9 January 1948

While the possibility of this object's being a meteor
is not ruled out, it seems unlikely. Meteors are not known to
be "light sky blue," nor to travel so slowly as indicated. Moreover, report also states that color was an "intense blue," and,
if speed were underestimated (or if object had a large radial
velocity component --- coming largely "head-on"), it might possibly be interpreted as a fireball.

- page 6 -

The image provided is a scanned document page and does not contain any photographs. Below is the text extracted from the document:

the top quarter which was flat, pot-shaped. The witness states that the
object definitely did not have the curved trajectory of a wingless missile.
Shortly after crossing his path, the blue flame sputtered and turned
immediately onward. The flame then died altogether but nothing was 
seen falling to the ground. Witness states that the flame was not of the 
long blazing type, but rather gave the impression that you were looking
down a long exhaust stack at a short but concentrated mass of blue flame
and further stated that his one previous night jet lab pilots in England during
the war leads him now to believe this object looked the same as the 
"Fire Bombs" chased by the RAF pilots at night. Several jet planes 
on this flight 9 Januaryby, also saw the object, the flame only, but
can give no further evidence for its identification.

[Redacted] stated on April 22 that seventy-five cattle had died of an
unknown disease on the farm of a Mr. [Redacted] Newman, Georgia, and expressed
concern over a possible connection between the unidentified objects and
important cities of the Aeronautical Division, US CAA, - however, the
Atlanta Office of the Animal Industry readily during this period. A map 
issued a message at this "unknown" disease has been spread more over a
year and other cases reported elsewhere in the countryj. For cattle back 
up more apparently remains on basis of communication beatween the object, 
Disease reports and the death of seventy-five cattle at Newman, Georgia.

SUBJECT: Incident Report

TO: Commanding General

          Dayton, Ohio
          Attention: MCID

    Commanding General
    Air Defense Command
    Mitchel Field, N.Y.
    Attention: A3/2, Intelligence

1. On January 10, 1948 one ****, Eastern Air Lines pilot,
reported to the Atlanta office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
that shortly before midnight 9 January 1948, he had observed an
unidentifiable object crossing the path of his aircraft in the area
of Cartersville and Acworth, Georgia.

2. Mr. **** was on a heading of about 130° Mag. enroute from
St. Louis, Missouri, to Atlanta at altitude of about 3000 feet, flying
at about 170-180 m.p.h. when the object crossed his path on an approximate
heading of 175° Mag. at the same altitude. All he could observe was
an intense blue flame (light, sky-blue) in a shape circular except
for the top quarter which was flat (the pilot compared the flame to the
surface of the top part of an iron cross about 100' below horizontal, but
definitely did not have the curved trajectory of magnesium inside.

3. Mr. **** estimates the speed of the object as being in the
neighborhood of 170-180 M.P.H. Shortly after crossing his path, the
blue flame sputtered and turned immediately earthward. The flame
then died altogether and Mr. **** could not see anything hitting
the ground.

4. Mr. **** states that the flame was not of the long-trailing
type but rather gave the impression that you were looking at it down a
long exhaust stack a short but concentrated mass of blue flame, and
further stated that his conversations with RAF pilots in England during
the war leads him now to believe this object looked the same as the
"Buzz Bombs" chased by those RAF pilots at night.

5. Mr. ******, purser on ******* flight 9 January
1948, also saw the object (the flame only, that is), but can give
no further evidence for its identification.

6. Army Flight Service reported no jet aircraft in the vicinity
that night. 

7. Neither Headquarters, Third Army nor the FBI has had further
evidence of an unidentified object in the air or crashing on that date.

8. Mr. ****** advised this office on April 29 that seventy-five
(75) cattle had died of an unknown disease on the farm of Mr. ******
at ********, Georgia, and expressed concern over a possible connection
between the unidentified object, the reported gas attacks at ******
approximately eighteen (18) hours earlier and the cattle fatality.
Industrial Division, U.S. Department of Agriculture, advises that this
"unknown" disease has appeared for over 1 year, and other cases
repeated elsewhere in the country for some time back. Although they
admit no cure yet has been found and the disease remains incompletely
diagnosed, there apparently remains no basis for connection between
the death Mr. ****** reports and the death of the seventy or more
cattle at ******, Georgia.

12 January 1948

Summary of Information:

A reliable government agency advised that an unidentified burning 
object was sighted North of Cartersville, Georgia, at midnight, January
9, 1948. (deleted), pilot, Eastern Airlines, advised that on the
night of January 9, at midnight, that he and (deleted) co-pilot,
(deleted) stewardess, and (deleted) as the 
third crewman, all purser on Eastern Airlines run between Charlotte,
North Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia, observed, at the time indicated,
an object flying past their plane going approximately 500 m.p.h.
This incident occurred North of Cartersville, Ga., at approximately
4,000 ft. The object which was brightly lighted, slanted down at a
ten degree angle. No one had a good look at the objects but Duoose felt
it was a rocket of some type inasmuch as it was moving parallel with the
plane and had bluish flame coming out of the rear.
