11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted an object which appeared to be disc shaped and flat, and from the sun's reflection appeared to be made of a metal similar to that used in airplane construction. There was no evidence of exhaust or vapor trails and no sound was heard. The object faded from view about 3 minutes after it was first sighted. Flight was level and constant.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

On 4 September 1949, ██████ ████████ ████████ and ███████ ████████
on a camping trip, both of Knoxville, Tenn., were interviewed and stated that while
sighted an unidentified flying object which was flying at very high altitude and at
a great rate of speed. The object was sighted by ███████ five miles north of Knoxville, they
1730 hrs., 1 Sept. 1949. ███████ first sighted the object while looking up into a
tree, at which time he called ███████ attention to it. Both were on the ground,
and the object, when sighted, was directly overhead at an altitude which they esti-
mated to be between 40,000 and 50,000 ft., and was flying at a high rate of speed
from the northeast (45 degrees) to the southwest (225 degrees). This object was in
level flight and in sight for from 2½ to 3 minutes from time of sighting. Object
appeared to be disc shaped and flat, and from the reflection appeared to be con-
structed of metal similar to that used in airplanes. There was no evidence of ex-
haust or vapor trails, nor was there any sound from the object. Both stated that
there was no surface wind, that the sky was void of clouds, and that the object
faded from view about three minutes after being sighted.
(B-2)

AGENT'S NOTE:

███████ is 18 years of age and a senior at the Central High School,
Knoxville, Tenn., where he has studied aeronautics for two years, ████████ is 14
years of age, but appears to be much older, and is a freshman at Central High School.
Both appear to be intelligent young men and their answers to all questions were made
without hesitation.

On 7 September 1949, officials of the U.S. Weather Bureau, McGee-Tyson,
Airport, Knoxville, Tenn., stated that weather balloons were released at 0400 hrs.,
1000 hrs., 1600 hrs., and 1800 hrs. daily by the Bureau. The officials furnished
the following information relative to winds aloft on 1 September 1949:
