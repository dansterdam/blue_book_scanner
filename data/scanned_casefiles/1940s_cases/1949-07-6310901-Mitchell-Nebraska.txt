Synopsis
None, this is an initial report

Investigation initiated by District Commander, 13th OSI District. 
On 26 July 1949, Dr. ███████ and one witness saw an unidentified spinning object approximately four miles away at an altitude of 5,000 to 7,000 feet maintaining a straight course towards the southwest. Object was traveling at an estimated 400 - 500 MPH.
The object emitted a bright light which closer inspection revealed to be the sun shining off the upper surfaces of the object which looked like an upside down saucer about 25 feet in diameter and three or four feet thick. The object was in view about three minutes and finally disappeared behind a line of hills. The weather was clear with light scattered clouds at 10,000 - 15,000 feet in the southwest, with a visibility of 40 miles.

The image displayed is a scanned page that appears to contain hand-drawn illustrations rather than photographs. The drawings are quite faint, but similar to the kinds often associated with sightings reported in the context of UFO investigations. Here are the two illustrations visible on the page:

1. A circle-like shape at the top half of the page, possibly representing a top view of a circular object. There seems to be a tiny dot or circle within the larger circle, possibly indicating a domed feature or some other detail on top of the object.

2. Below the circular shape, there's a side view of a half-oval or saucer-shaped object. This could be depicting the profile of the same object shown in the circle above.

However, given the poor quality and faintness of the illustrations, it's challenging to make out distinct details.

Regarding the textual content, due to the low resolution and the faintness of the text, it is difficult to read any words accurately. It appears that there is some writing below the saucer-like drawing, potentially specifications or descriptions, but it is indiscernible in the image provided. If you need transcription of the text, a clearer and higher-resolution image would be necessary.
