California, 22 July 1948, by MR. [REDACTED].

2. On 17 September 1948, MR.[REDACTED], Power Consultant, of
[REDACTED] Vanal Avenue, Canoga Park, California, was interviewed regarding sight-
ing of unidentified aerial object on 22 July 1948. [REDACTED] referred to the
letter of 13 August 1948 which he addressed to Air Material Command, Wright-
Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, report of observation of objects ques-
tion. His statement was substantially the same. [REDACTED] additional re-
marks made and information given by him are: 1. Included in sighted observa-
tions, a "balloonist's theodolite" or kindred item was spotted. Same re-
search in question is this type of aeronautical apparatus. 2. Observed two
objects in question the short subject was spherical in shape and reflected a
bluish color luminescence, seen as an internal lam.

3. On 17 September 1948, MRS. [REDACTED] housewife, of [REDACTED]

Incident #163 -- VanNuys, California -- 21 July 1948

Since a complete description of this incident is given
in numerous reports from Mt. Wilson Observatory and Griffith Planetarium, since the observations there were made with telescopes by astronomical observers, and since their descriptions agree that the object was in all respects balloon-like, there is nothing that this investigator can add. The object was evidently an unidentified balloon.

STATEMENT

Statement made by Mr. ******, Former Consultant, Department of
Water and Power, Van Nuys, California; Home Address: **** **** **, *****
Concord San Francisco, 1230 hours, 27 June 52, concerning objects
sighted in the sky, 22 July 1947, in the vicinity of San Fernando Valley,
California:

"On the evening of 22 July 1947, between the hours of 11:30 and 2030,
my wife and I were having dinner in the patio of our home. Our attention
was called to a moving object in the sky by some children playing in the
street. Originally, this object was quite steady. And as we watched, this
object was attracted by other persons to a strange object in the sky almost
directly overhead.

DESCRIPTION: It appeared to be round and probably spherical. At sunset, it
seemed to be a weather balloon. At about 20,000 feet in the sky was a bit
of a silvery looking object. The sun was below the range of the top of
the object and just put this object in good silhouette. It was round. At
while, I considered maybe saucer size (?). Wasn't too bright to be not a star.
It had no lights whatever. It was quite steady and then such brightness or
color gradually changed to an orange color at one end and finally appeared off
altogether when you saw the full object at twilight. It was looking pretty
well. It looked about the size of one (not distinguishable) maybe less or more
(Perhaps a commercial airplane at 25,000 feet. It was the size of a dime
held at arm's length or such a round object against the sky.) No attachments,
no tail, just a clear edge and silhouette against (not sunglasses or the clothing)
the air was very clear with visibility unlimited; ground temperature about
70-75 deg(rees) dropping to about 60 degrees an hour after dark (two hour
time lapse); direction of travel was from East directly toward the sun.

ADDITIONAL INTERROGATION OF MR. ****** AGAINST NOTES M. SPROUL

MR. SPROUL: Can you estimate the geographical location when you first
sighted the object?

MR. ******: Directly over Van Nuys, about 25-30 or 30 degrees as it traveled.

MR. SPROUL: Approximately what was the time when you first sighted this
object?

MR. ******: I didn't know the exact hour, but it was about an hour be-
fore sundown.

MR. SPROUL: Who called your attention to the object?

MR. ******: Non-commissioned member of a crew at the nearby station.

MR. SPROUL: What were the weather conditions at this time?

MR. ******: Very clear sky, visibility unlimited.

MR. SPROUL: What was the size of the object as it first appeared on the edge
of sight?

MR. ******: About the size of a dime at arm's length.

17. STROULL: What was the approximate size of the object?

-REDACTED-: The size, as near as I could judge, would be a weather balloon
at 2,000 feet. I am POSITIVE it was not a weather balloon.

18. STROULL: What would you estimate its speed?

-REDACTED-: That I wouldn't know except that it traveled about 25 or 30
degrees of approximately forty-five minutes to an hour.

19. STROULL: In what direction did it move?

-REDACTED-: Overhead and directly into the sun,

20. STROULL: Did you think it might be a reflection from something?

-REDACTED-: I thought it might be a reflection from the sunlight at first
but then I couldn't account for it being time.

21. STROULL: Did it glint or sparkle?

-REDACTED-: No, it didn't sparkle at all. The light from the object was
constant with a constant luminescent or soft glow, As the sun set
lower until it seemed to travel at a very high speed into sunlight
losing its luminescent and then got smaller, smaller, and faded.
It being orange color, It was just over my head when it started
changing of coloring, when it disappeared completely, 

22. STROULL: What was the manner of disappearance?

-REDACTED-: It disappeared without leaving a trace of it, I was looking
directly at it, then it, it seemed to dissolve as an incandescent
light with one turns off the switch. There was no change in speed
and no change in direction whatsoever, That is the last I saw
of the object,

23. STROULL: Any tactics employed during flight or object?

-REDACTED-: No change in altitude or direction,

24. STROULL: Was there any sound to this object?

-REDACTED-: There was no sound whatsoever,

25. STROULL: Was there an exhaust trail?

-REDACTED-: No exhaust trail at all,

26. STROULL: Did you notice the object-to overhead any other?

-REDACTED-: There were no distinguishing characteristics at all except for
the bluish light,

I was at least over and over, but frankly, there is immediately

Q. SHOULD: Do you feel that you were observing a definite object?

A. "Yes, it had a definite sharp outline - something I had never
seen before. At first I thought it might be a meteor coming
toward us. It didn't have the characteristics of gaseous forms-
comet and the outlines was to definite and sharp to be gaseous.
It instead appeared to be a definite material object. I had
even considered that it might be an astronomical object caught
in our Earth's rotation like the moon, but it travelled faster
than the sun so it couldn't have been. It was travelling three
times as fast as the sun and was going in the same direction as
the sun.

Q. SHOULD: Do you know any of the persons who observed this object per-
sonally?

A. No.

STATEMENT

Statement made by Mrs. █████████ of █████████ Park,
California, 1215 hours, 17 September 1948, regarding a object sighted in the
sky, 22 July 1948, in the vicinity of San Fernando Valley, California.

"On the evening of 22 July 1948, at Valley Market Town, while in the company of my husband, ██ called my husband and we were having dinner in the patio when my attention was called by my husband to an object in the sky. This was approximately between the hours of 1930 and 2000, before dark. Upon gazing straight upward, the object seemed to be round and luminous. It appeared to me metallic changing to yellow-orange and to deeper hues, toward a blue, as darkness came. It seemed to be at a very great distance. In a comparison the size, I would be as if I were looking at a planet such as *Jupiter* or *Saturn* as they plainly veer distinct. There were no attendant gaseous elements, no rays or sound as far as I can remember. It seemed absolutely round. At this time, the sky was cloudless. There was no other object or aircraft in the sky. In fact, it was the only object in the sky. Over a period of twenty minutes or more, the object moved from strait upward to a westerly direction. I must sadly state, I do not have an exceptional, excellent memory for recalling minutes or object in a steady gliding motion. There was no gradual trail, was drawn from this object. The color of this object changed drastically and due to reflect the atmospheric conditions of nightfall. When my attention was drawn to it, I no longer saw it. My attention was drawn to it, as stated above, by my husband who was standing with a group of eight or ten people who were also gazing at the object. The object was entirely different from anything I had ever seen. It did not appear to be a balloon or any advertising device. It was a definite material object."

Ltr, FTD, to CG, AMC, Subj: Analysis of Proj. "Grudge" Reported Incidents

4. It is believed that certain of the items in the questionnaire -- Checklist-Identification Flying Objects -- produce insignificant and unreliable data from an observer. These are: 9, Distance of object from observer; 11. Altitude; 12. Speed; and 16. Size. For any unfamiliar object beyond the focal range of the human eyes (about 60 ft.), these four factors are mutually inter-dependent and therefore indeterminant unless at least one of them (and some observed angles) are known. Directly asking an observer about these indeterminants not only gets unreliable data but induces wild answers because the observer is led into making a statement about quantities for which he has no basis in fact. He will unconsciously assume knowledge of some one of these factors and so give incorrect information on all. The people (many of whom should know better) still absurdly give fantastic evaluations on significant figures on these questions, which really cannot be answered at all, is proof of the unreliability of their information.

5. It is suggested that these four items on the questionnaire be replaced by questions which will yield answers possible of being independent facts in terms of the observer's best estimates of angles and time. From such data given by observers of the same object at two different places, a reliable ocular triangulation could be made of the object's size, altitude, speed and path. These data should include:

a. An estimate of the angular size of the object. A quick but reasonable estimate can be made by comparing this angle subtended by the index finger held at arms length. The finger (at 25" wide) of an average man is a 2'6 20' to 30' (arc) length fully suff edged an angle of appoximately two degrees. In this way angular size from about 1/2 to about 50 can be estimated.

b. The range of the object's flight in terms of the angle subtended by the ooserved path. If the object moves in a reasonably straight course it is important to observe the position at the beginning and end of its course. After this flight has been completed a person can extend his arms toward the two points and also at 90 o or 120 o and by comparison estimate the angular extent of the flight. It is also important that information which will determine those directions relative to a compass point be given. If the angular course is associated with objects on the horizon, with roads, with the sun (if the time of day is also noted) or by the north star, this orientation can be rechecked at any later time.

c. The time required for the object to traverse this observed course. This is probably the most DIFFICULT estimate to make. Timing items as such is the most satisfactory, but an observer is seldom prepared to do so. Seconds can be counted with good accuracy by saying,

5. Construction, size, shape, etc.
[REDACTED] and I viewed
the object through a six-inch telescope on the mountain top about
ten minutes after it was first sighted belov at the -observatory.
At the observatory it was viewed through a portable three-inch
telescope. Dr. [REDACTED] sometime
were observing at the six-inch. [REDACTED], and
I were the only ones who examined the object through the six-inch.

The nature of the object was inmediately apparent through the
six-inch, which enabled us to see it as if only a few yards away.
it consistad of a thin translucent outer envelope enclosing a
sphere at the top, the whole having the shape of a pear. Beneath
this pear-shaped assembly a square yellow disk was attached by
cords, I am sure of these facts.

I believe also that the thin outer envelope had a diamond
shaped pattern as if criss-crossed by a network of cords. Also
that the cords attached to the yellow disk extended beyond it.

As the object was unfamiliar to us and there was nothing nearby
with which to compare it, we could not make an accurate estimate
of its size. After thinking it over, however, I think we can
get a good idea of its size as follows: I would estimate that
the object spanned about 1/5 the diameter of the full moon or
subtended an angle of 8°. Today (September 22) I called Mr.
[REDACTED] and asked him how he thought the object was,
[REDACTED] from me is made an estimate of 1/3 the full
moon, which is in good agreement.

d. Estimation of the elevation angle of the object. Almost all persons will overestimate elevation angles. This tendency can be reduced by the observer extending one arm vertically and the other horizontally to observe a 90° angle. The vertical arm can then be lowered to point to the observed object. In this way the observed angle can be compared with a 90° angle and a more accurate estimate obtained.

6. It is realized that it might not be possible for an observer to perform the operations suggested in the preceding paragraph, during the period the object is sighted. If he would immediately reconsider what he saw and then estimate such measurements, he should be able to give quantitatively answers accurate to at least 25%. In interrogating observers, they should also be asked to reconstruct the observations and then estimate them as soon as possible. It is suggested that instructions for making such quick and estimated observations be given to weather observers, control tower operators, civil pilots, forest and fire . rangers, and other such people who might have good chance of seeing unidentified flying objects. If any information concerning unidentified flying objects is given to the public, instructions for reliable observations should be included.

7. This organization will be pleased to be of any further assistance required in connection with this matter.

Object appeared round and probably spherical. At first looked 
similar to weather balloon at about 2000 ft but there was no 
characteristic bobbing. The wind was blowing the ground with 
fair strength and gusty yet the object was quite steady. In the 
time it was under observation (about an hour) it traveled thru a 
vertical arc of about 25° or more. After watching the object for 
a while the observer concluded that whatever it was the thing was 
at great height but not a star, It had a bluish luminescence like 
a fluorescent lamp and as the sun set the color gradually changed to an 
orange color at dusk and finally snapped off like a lamp when the 
switch is thrown. The outline was clear and sharp and symmetrical (no 
fuzziness or blurring), the air clear with visibility unlimited. 
Direction of travel from East directly toward the sun.

Gentlemen:

REPORT OF STRANGE OBJECT IN FLIGHT

On the evening of 22 July 1947, my wife and I were having dinner in the 
patio of an open air market in Van Nuys, California. We arrived there
about an hour before dark. Our attention was attracted by other patrons
to a strange object in the sky almost directly overheard.

Description. It appeared to be round and probably spherical. At first
it appeared to be a weather balloon at about 20,000 feet but there was none
of the characteristic bobbing. The wind was blowing on the ground in
rather strong and gusty. The object was quite steady, hence we watching
it a while I concluded that whatever it was it was at a great height but not
a star. It had a bluish haze or luminance like a fluorescent lamp and as the
sun set the color gradually changed to an orange color at dusk and finally
snapped off like a lamp when you throw the switch (at which moment I was
looking right at it). In about an hour that I had been observing it, the
object had travelled through a vertical arc of about 5 degrees or more.
The outline of the object was clear and sharp and symmetrical (no fuzziness
or blurring); the air was very clear with visibility unlimited; ground
temperature about 70-75 degrees dropping to about 60 degrees an hour after
dark (two hour time lapse); direction of travel was from East directly
toward the sun.

Very truly yours,

Capt. Ord-----
