The image provided is a scan of a document with extremely faint text. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any photograph within the image to describe. Furthermore, the text is not clearly visible, making it very difficult to accurately transcribe, and parts of the text seem to be illegible. However, I will attempt to extract and provide as much of the visible text as I can discern:

```
HEADQUARTERS 
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE

Attachment to report of observation of an unidentified 
aerial object, by [CENSORED], encountered, New Mexico,
on 27 March 1949.

The object first appeared high in the sky to the northwest,
apparently headed southeast. It then dived steeply, turning
toward the west, and slowed to one third of its original horizontal height. This diving and climbing was repeated two or 
three times. There was no change in the ratio between 
the length and width during these maneuvers. At the top 
of one of its climbs, the object appeared to head back toward the east; there was a red glitter or white light
at the head of the object as it levelled off. Than it 
dived and raced back to the west.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS.
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

The object first appeared high in the sky to the southwest;
apparently headed southwest. It then dived steeply, turning
toward the West, then leveled off and climbed to its original
height. This diving and climbing was repeated two or three
times. There was no change in the ratio between the length and

DETAILS:

CLEVELAND, OHIO UNCLASSIFIED 

Mr. T.P. HILLIARD, Aviation Safety Agent, Department Of Commerce, Civil Aeronautics Administration, Office of Aviation Safety. Municipal Airport Cleveland, Ohio, stated as follows:

"On March 7, 1949, at approximately 14:45 while enroute from Toledo, Ohio to Cleveland, Ohio, via aircraft, I had an unusual incident occur.

When approximately four miles west of Vermilion, Ohio. over the lakeshore at 2500 feet MSL altitude, an object was suddenly observed approaching head-on at the same altitude. I immediately pulled up into a steep right turn to avoid a collision and completed a turn to the right to observe the object with which I had nearly collided, but very much to my amazement. I was. unable to locate anything with the naked eye even after spending several minutes searching the area. There was an overcast approximately 500 feet above my altitude so I finally decided the object may have climbed into the clouds.

My first impression was that I had nearly collided with a powered model airplane but after giving it more thought, I realized this was impossible as the head-on view of the fuselage was too large to be that of a model as the front view of the fuselage appeared to have an oval shape the size as an P-80 and appeared to measure 18 to 20 inches from top to bottom and 12 to 14 inches in width and painted red. Wings were mounted in the center of the fuselage or as a mid-wing and each appeared be about three feet long or a total span of six to eight feet and were painted light gray.

After landing at Cleveland, Ohio, I discussed the incident with a few close friends and let the matter drop as it was so fantastic, but after careful consideration, I now think this information should be on record.

As a matter of information, I have been flying for twenty years with approximately 6500 hours and hold an Airline Transport Pilot Rating Certificate with all ratings. The foregoing is not meant to create a vivid imagination but an explanation of the facts to the best of my knowledge."

The photograph at the bottom of the page shows a grainy, black and white image that appears to be of the sky or a similarly vast expanse. There are variations in shading across the image, possibly due to clouds, atmospheric conditions, or photographic artifacts. Specific details are not visible due to the quality and graininess of the photograph.

The text on the document is mostly illegible due to the poor quality of the scan. It appears to be a standard form with various fields, but the contents of these fields cannot be accurately transcribed. There is a visible bracketed text at the bottom right of the form that reads "Astro [rest is illegible]". The rest of the document's contents are not clear enough to provide an accurate OCR result.
