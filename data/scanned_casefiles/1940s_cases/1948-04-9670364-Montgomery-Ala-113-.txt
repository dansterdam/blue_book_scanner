Flying Disc sa
Montgomery, Ala.
9 April 1948

MEMORANDUM FOR THE OFFICER IN CHARGE

On 9 April 1948, approximately 1500 hours, this agent interviewed Lt.
Colonel [Redacted] [Redacted], Tactic Division, Air Tactical School, Tyndall Air
Force Base, who stated in substance: He had left Tyndall approximately 1410
hours on 9 April 1948, flying a P-51 at the altitude of 20000 feet. He
had proceeded to Montgomery, Alabama, and just previous to sighting the town
had let down to the altitude of 10000 feet and directly over the town had
made a 180 degree left's turn. Just before completing his left's turn, he had
sighted an object at 10 o'clock off his left wing which appeared to be a
silver disc. Colonel [Redacted] had immediately made a sharp bank to the left in
order to follow the object which appeared to be heading North West. After
completing his turn, Colonel [Redacted] had been able to get a better look at the
object which he had first thoughts to be merely a disc and described as as
follows: Top part of the object's approximately eight feet in diameter, silver
in color, had the appearance of a parachute. Attached to the bottom of this
had been a dark cable or shroud which appeared to be approximately five feet
long, (suspended upon the cable had been a large standard box bell (Colonel
[Redacted] could not discern which) also silver in color. The main outer or ball
of the appearance of being slightly to the rear of the top part of the
disc. The overall appearance of the object, according to Colonel [Redacted],
looked something similar to the parachute and counter measure, photographic
ejecting equipment dropped from a T-7 associate. Colonel [Redacted] had kept the
object in sight for approximately forty-five seconds but had lost it at exactly
1510 hours. At this time he had how right of the object, [Redacted] had reported
two 'contrails' acting NO miles per hour at speed, and the object had moved
to ONE away from him on a horizontal plane rather than a vertical decline.
[Redacted] further stated that he got just at its missed speed they have changed course
during the time it was in sight but it was impossible for his to definitely
establish this fact as his aircraft had been in a sharp turn during part of
the time the object had been in sight. At this time also just had been
sighted the weather had been clear, no clouds, visibility and ceiling unlimited;
and as far as Colonel [Redacted] could determine the object had made no sound and
no exhaust trail had been seen. After having lost the object, Colonel [Redacted]
proceeded to return to Tyndall Air Force Base and upon landing, reported the
above mentioned incident to the Intelligence Officer, Tyndall A.F.B. Attached
hereto as Exhibit 1 is a sketch of the object's appropriate confirmation.

AGENTS NOTES:

U N C L A S S I F I E D

It is to be noted, Colonel [Redacted] told his story both to this agent and
to Lt. [Redacted], n.d., Tyndall, at separate interviews and in both instances his
story coincided.

The image provided shows a page that appears to be from a document with the title "CONFIDENTIAL" at the top. However, the photograph is blurry, and the text is mostly unreadable due to the poor quality of the image. Because of this, I am not able to accurately transcribe the content of the document or describe any photographs that might be included in the document. The legibility of the text is compromised, which prevents me from performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to output the text found in the document.

The object cited in this incident answers to the description of an, instrument-carrying balloon. In any case, where is nothing whatever in the report which would allow for an astronomical interpretation.

Attention can be called to the similarity of the description given here to that of incident #81.

1. Project “SIGN” is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sightings of unidentified flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the files of Project “SIGN” are forwarded for study and recommendations as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project “SIGN” except that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball lightnings. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are checked by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks are usually made direct from the Project “SIGN” office, MCIAO-3. These checks are distinct from the check of synoptic balloon flights made by weather service stations or the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce, (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed incidents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining incidents are balloons.

Investigations by this headquarters reveal that a synoptic
weather balloon could have been at the location where sightings
were reported in the following incidents. In compiling this
list consideration was given to the wind direction and speed at
the surface and aloft at the scheduled time of balloon release, and
the location of the nearest weather station making balloon obser-
vations.

---

The object, sighted at ten o'clock off his left vain, a peared to be a
silve. disc. He immediately contacted shape tank to his left and was
told to get a better look at the object and disseminted it as follows:

"The top part of the object approximately eight feet in diameter, silver
in color, shaped like the top of a parachute. Attached to the bottom of this
bell was a dark cable or cord it appeared to be approximately two
long. Suspended upon this cable had been a large canister or ball (Color not
being couldnot discern which) also silver in color. This canister or
ball had the appearance of being silghtly to the nose of the topart of the
object. The over-all appearance of theobject, looked something similar to
the parachute and canister containing photographic tracking equipment droped
from a T-29 rocket."

At the time he lost sight of the object, winged aircraft had been
indicating 310 miles per hour air speed, but the object appeared to fly
away from him on a horizontal plane rather than a vouical decline.

A sketch of the object is attached.
