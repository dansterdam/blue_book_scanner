SPECIAL INQUIRY

Report of S/A R. R. LUDSEN, 10th District OSI, 21-29, 27 May 1949

On 7 May 1949, unidentified light observed at 2130 hours, was visible for approximately 35 minutes. Light was stationary, color varied from white to blue with flashes of red.

On 23 May, four separate observations were made of six aerial phenomena. Observations were made at 1000, 2210, 2330, and period 2330 to 0030 hours.

On 3 June, civilian type aircraft made an emergency landing near restricted area, damaging fence. Investigation by F. B. I. indicated no ulterior motive.

On 6 June, unusual light observed at 2105 hours by two observers, and was in sight for two minutes and forty seconds. Same object was also observed by two other observers from a different azimuth.

On 13 June, unusual light observed at 2015 hours, in sight for approximately two to three seconds, moving very fast. On 13 June, unusual light was observed at 2300 hours by two officer observers for a period of from five to thirty seconds.

On 7 July, informal information received indicating Fourth Army made request for assistance of Air Technical Intelligence Team from Headquarters Air Materiel Command.

Captain [redacted] at approximately [redacted] hours, monitoring the [coordinate 91.5 - 3.5'.5 and axis (an co.)], through binoculars, object remained stationary for approximately thirty-seven (37) minutes, was round and twice the size of a tar... at several miles. Color varied, being predominantly white, with the bluish-white outlines of red. No maneuvers were observed, and the weather was unusually fair with scattered clouds and a wind from the south, velocity of about 15 miles per hour. Observer followed object both with the naked eye and through field glasses. The standard form "Guide to Investigation, Unidentified Aerial Objects" has been furnished G-2 and copy is retained in files of District Office No. 10.

2. On 23 July 1949, [redacted], Tank Battalion, 2d Armored Division, Camp Hood, Texas, observed an unusual light. Observation made at 2210 hours from Observation Post No. 1, map coordinate [redacted]. Object an object with a light too intense to be a star and round in shape, and slightly copper color, or orange with a greenish yellow in color. The object was in sight for approximately two or three minutes, and was about 5,000' - 5,500' from the observer. Speed was slow and object appeared to go... No maneuvers were noted. Observation was made without assistance of optical instruments. Object was north of the observer and traveled from east to west, then from west to east. 

3. On 23 May 1949, [redacted], Company "B", [redacted], 2d Armored Division, Camp Hood, Texas, while on guard at Observation Post No. 1, map coordinate [redacted], observed unusual light. Time of observation was 2330 hours, and the object seen was one which re-appeared approximately twenty times, described as being round, about the size of a half dollar. Color was similar to that of a light bulb. Object was in sight for several seconds and moved straight up and down

Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Radars now operating on ground
   No radar in area.

   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size
      of target:
      Not Applicable.

   b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180 degrees),

      N.A.

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into
      several targets upon approach:
      N.A.

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent
      with size of object; faint; fading, pulsating at regular rate:
      N.A.

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?
      N.A.

2. If airborne, when object was sighted
