SPECIAL INQUIRY

Report of S/A R. R. LUDSEN, 10th District OSI, 21-29, 27 May 1949

On 7 May 1949, unidentified light observed at 2130 hours, was visible for approximately 35 minutes. Light was stationary, color varied from white to blue with flashes of red.

On 23 May, four separate observations were made of six aerial phenomena. Observations were made at 1000, 2210, 2330, and period 2330 to 0030 hours.

On 3 June, civilian type aircraft made an emergency landing near restricted area, damaging fence. Investigation by F. B. I. indicated no ulterior motive.

On 6 June, unusual light observed at 2105 hours by two observers, and was in sight for two minutes and forty seconds. Same object was also observed by two other observers from a different azimuth.

On 13 June, unusual light observed at 2015 hours, in sight for approximately two to three seconds, moving very fast. On 13 June, unusual light was observed at 2300 hours by two officer observers for a period of from five to thirty seconds.

On 7 July, informal information received indicating Fourth Army made request for assistance of Air Technical Intelligence Team from Headquarters Air Materiel Command.
