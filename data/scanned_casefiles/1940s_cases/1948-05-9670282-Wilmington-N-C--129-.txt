The U.S. Air Force
Investigating Team, D. C.

Gentlemen,

Speaking of flying saucers. I thought to communicate with 
you about what happened to both of us the 1st time when
and as I said to you how it came to us. The place was blazing
over to our job. before we could make a head or tail 
out of it and the object was moving at such speed I tried
to show it to my
co-worker, co-captain of the team but before I could
get him to see the crew and look their way it was all
over with. It was round and like a disc. Then it looked
to be a sheen and that isn't a thing but just like a 
cold rush that went their time had been of course
like at first it Theresa etc, but Van told me when
I asked about late summer of 1941, it was troubling
tome would you know with me or with much.
can you just talk and tell me ?
Yours Truly,

[REDACTED]

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #129 -- Wilmington, North Carolina -- 31 May 1948

Evidence in this incident is contradictory, especially concerning tactics, but from the ragged description and the fact that the object emitted smoke and travelled at high speed, the possibility of its having been a meteor is not ruled out. Apparent oblong shape might have arisen from persistence of vision of a rapidly travelling bright object.

Is there a government testing field for guided missiles near by?

Cape Fear River, then turned at a low speed back towards Wilmington,
a little to the west.

The local office of the Civil Aeronautics administration reported a
supposition by Bluethenthal Field's station manager plausible, that
objects could have been a F-80 flying in flight. The CAA said there was no
such plane in the sky there at the time.

MYSTERIOUS FLYING BODY IS SEEN AT WILMINGTON

WILMINGTON, May 31 - Wilmington residents today reported another mystery sky object, but it was not
another flying saucer. An object which emitted smoke, was about as big as your hat and about three feet 
long which traveled at an "awfully high altitude, and not fast not fast" and made a sound like a scream,
of Bluesthen street at 1:20 a.m., back towards Green-
ville, than veered at a low speed, NW. by the Cape Fear
villa, a little to the west," Mrs. H. D. Alsobrook,
who lives at 709 South Sixth Street, said

Mrs. Alsobrook said that her sister who lives near,
called her to look at the strange object. Mrs.
Charles Colvin is the sister and is said to have seen
the object first. Mrs. S. P. Huffman, another neighbor
said she saw it too.

The local office of the Civil Aeronautics administration
discredited a suggestion by Bluesthenfield field's station manager James Flora, that the that could have been a F-80 plane in flight. "No comment, did it have wings? much place in
the sky here at the time.
