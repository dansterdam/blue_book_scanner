Her attention was first called to the object by Mrs. [redacted]. It was
sighted almost directly north of their position in the back yard to heir
homes. (In elevation, it appeared to be just above the hose line the next
street (estimated by undersigned 25Â° elevation). The object was could not
be determined, it proceeded in an easterly direction climbing very rapidly,
seemly to level out for a short while, then climbed rapidly, disappeaaring in
the red twilight of the horizon, but firstly direction. The object was round in
shape when seen in full in the westward direction. The west side gave the
coloration "glinting over" silhouet, but when seen edgewise, it was concave
in color but not the other side plus brightness continuously. The side was dull

any size could not be estimated, it did not appear very large or the air
but could have been a room-sized object. There was no trail, no vapor or smoke,

was repeated several times. What the time in sight was described as two or threo

was no trail of vapor or smoke and no noise. There was no other object of any
but not round in all directions. It appeared to be flat, when seen edqewise,
thus could hardly be seen in that attitude. Her son also saw the object and
described it as being like the lid of a large tin can sailing the air (i.e.,
the way a flat round object sails when thrown and spun, turning over gradually.)
