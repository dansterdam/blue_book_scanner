---
No. 219. Time of sighting coincides within a few minutes of the release time of the USAF rawlinsonde at Newburgh and a pilot balloon sounding at New York. Very little description given that can be interpreted as other being a burning balloon or an aerostar. No negative reasons was that the object moved from East to West, an impossible situation for a balloon since winds at all levels were westerly.

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, TCIAXS,
dated 19 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation Of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction
of Flight of Objects," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as to the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative Radar Positioning" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.
