THE PALLADIUM-ITEM
RICHMOND, INDIANA

November 6, 1948

To Whom It May Concern:

When I came to work on the morning of November 5,
1948 I noted a typed memo from ---------- a sports writer on the
staff who had worked the night before.

In substance, he note told about the glow he had
seen in the sky shortly before 5 a.m. on the morning of Friday,
November 5th. His attention had been attracted to the lights, he
said, by two telephone calls that came in about 4:55 a.m. He
looked out the window, he said, and saw the light "about the size or
less than the size of a no. 2 pencil eraser" and proceeding "taking two
or three minutes to what he saw." It is not recorded along with
a glossy print (which he had made in our photo lab)

I have known ---------- for over two years as 
a member of the state news. From my observation and contact, I
know him to be a trustworthy person and an honorable citizen.
By the nature of his reporting, he is apt to get as many true
facts as possible. His alertness is evidenced by the fact that
he took two pictures of the "floating light" he saw in the eastern
sky over Richmond (at no time -- I read him say to someone he
saw no object that he considered could be the air force. And
is married, happily I believe. His habits do not include smoking
or drinking. He is a member of the local Junior Chamber of
Commerce.

I personally did not see this "light" mentioned above,

Respectfully submitted,

DATE: 8 November 48

INCIDENT #6377
SUBJECT: USAF Parachute Flares

1. Reference is made to the discussion regarding subject item this date.

2. Investigation conducted by this office has revealed that, as previously
stated, the approximate burning time of USAF Parachute Flares never exceeds
5 to 8 minutes and the flares are most generally designed for a burning time of
only three minutes. The L.E.S. however, a tow Type is normal flare that consists of
several (two-nine) flares as a chain, tied together which is towed behind an
aircraft (but never dropped by parachute), and which is designed to burn one at
a time consecutively to facilitate night tracking and gunnery practice.

3. Training manual, number TM 9-1985-3 includes descriptions of all standard
type USAF Flares and Signals. It is suggested that the photographs in this
manual, which show flares functioning, could possibly be utilized for comparison
purposes.

Text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

Incidents #157 -- Richmond, Indiana -- 5 November 1948

This incident very likely has an astronomical explanation;
the object sighted was probably Venus. Venus rose on November 6 at 
about 3:30 a. m. and an hour later would have been a little south of
east at an altitude of about 10°. Its magnitude was -3.7, or about
six times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. The photo-
graph taken of the object et head does not contradict this hypothesis.

It is unlikely that the object observed was the bright
comet (1948l) discovered one day earlier in the southern hemisphere,
for this comet at that time was very far to the south and east, almost
on the horizon, and was very much fainter than Venus. If this object
seen here had been the comet, the persons observing it could lay claim
to the first discovery; it was discovered one day later in Australia
because of much more favorable location.

Venus, of course was visible all during the autumn of 1948
in approximately the same position as that in which it was seen on
the morning of November 5.

It is also of interest to note that Mercury had its greatest
western elongation on November 6, but it rose just at the beginning of
the morning twilight and would therefore have been just rising at the
time of this incident. Furthermore, Mercury was much less brilliant
than Venus.

Incident #197

A statement obtained from Professor ████████, Astronomer, Earl-
ham College by Capt. S. Reider, MCIWCIO-3, revealed that it was the
Professor's opinion that the object was not a star.

Incident: 197

At approximately 0135 A. M., 5th May, 47 a woman phoned the office
of The Palladium Item, Richmond, Indiana, to report a light in the
east which she stated resembled a flare hanging from a parachute.
Shortly thereafter a man reported the object. It was red with white
the window and saw a brilliant white light a bit south of east. It
seemed to flicker a great deal, and appeared much larger than a star
so he doubted the possibility of it being a heavenly body. Lining
it up with the corner of a certain building and observing it for a
few minutes he noted no movement. He called the police but they
knew nothing of it. Going to the upper roof he watched it for some
10 minutes. He then went down, secured a camera and returned to the
roof and proceeded to take a time exposure. Upon his return to the
roof he noted that the object appeared dimmer due to an overcast
to the east. A short time later the sky was overcast from low clouds
estimated at about 1,000 ft. However, when he object was first ob-
served the night was clear with stars out. He thought the size
of the object, compared some five to ten times that of a normal star.
He took two pictures of the "floating light."

Mr. ███████ is considered a trustworthy person. His employer,████
█████████, stated that he attempts to obtain as many true facts as
possible. He considers ████████ honest and sincere, Mr. ████████

The content of the photo is difficult to discern due to the low resolution and quality, but it appears to be a grainy, black-and-white image possibly depicting a light or glow in the sky which the article references.

Strange Glow In Eastern Sky
Attracts Notice; Picture Taken

Richmond, Ind—A
One of those strange bright
lights in the sky attracted the
interest of a few local persons
early Friday morning.
No one was able to say wheth-
er it was one of those "flying sau-
cers" or not. But it remained in
the eastern sky for nearly 20 min-
utes and at least one photograph-
er took a picture of the night
visitor.
Two calls were recieved at The
Palladium-Item at 4:35 a.m. about
a "light which resembled a flare
hanging from a parachute."
According to reports, it was
visible about five to 10 times
the size of a normal star. One per-
son said it looked "like a kin-
dled flare."
Dale Stevens, sports writer who
happened to be in the office writ-
ing some stories, said he thought
the light flickered a great deal, and
it "seemed to grow dim and
bright. The sky at the time was
clear and stars were visible." Stevens
said. "I watched it for a few
minutes before I took a picture of
it. By 4:35 a.m. it could moved
slightly eastward, entirely.
An observer said he was impressed
by its size and brilliance and the
fact that it flickered and seemed
to swing.
Professor Berlin Earls, member
ber of the Earlham college facul-
falty, indicated that perhaps it might
have been a flare dropped from
a passing plane.

—Palladium-Item Photo
Here is a photograph of the
"floating light" seen from the
roof of the Palladium Publishing
corporate building at about 5 a.
m. Friday.

0500hrs 5/Nov/?

THE PALLADIUM-ITEM
RICHMOND, INDIANA

Saturday, Nov. 6, 1948

To: Commanding General
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
Attn: TLO/AFO-3

In compliance with verbal request from representatives of your
command Herewith is my statement of events as they occurred on or
about the 5th of November, 1948 at 0435 hours, central standard time.

I was working in office after hours and answered the phone
at approximately 0435 a.m. A lady asked if I had noticed the light
in the east, which she said resembled a flare hanging pending from
a parachute. I said I would check on it. Immediately after she hung
up a call called with a similar statement.

I looked out the window and saw a brilliant white light to
the east, a bit north. It seemed to be altering a great deal and
was much larger than a star so I discounted the possibility of it
being a heavenly body.

I lined it up with a corner of a building in the alley to
see if it was moving and saw a couple of minutes <illegible text>
movement, I called the police to check on it then and they knew nothing
of it.

I went to the upper floor or it a total of 4 or about 10 minutes,
then came down at a ^ past 5 to write a story of it.

By the time I returned to the roof for the picture, the light
was a bit dimmer.

Within even more minutes the sky was overcast from lower clouds
