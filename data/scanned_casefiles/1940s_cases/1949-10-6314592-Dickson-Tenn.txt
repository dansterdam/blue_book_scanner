The text in the document reads as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

"Later, a Canadian authority said they probably saw a fireball or meteor, a fireball being bigger than the usual meteor.

"Last Monday, residents of Lynors, Ontario, reported they saw a huge streak of fire race through the sky, perform a neat loop and disappear."

DICKSON, TENNESSEE

Oct 26 1949

Chief,
U.S.Army Intelligence Service,
Washington,Tenn.

Dear Sirs;

Recently on my farm seven miles from this town I saw one of the flying saucers.It was an object the shape of a saucer, flying very high and at a very high rate of speed.Of hugh size, made of aluminum and powered by motors.Not jets. It is invisible unless the sun strikes it at the proper angle. There were four other adults in the party that saw it.

Just thought you might be interested in knowing this.

Very truly yours,

P.S.I prefer no publicity about this matter.
