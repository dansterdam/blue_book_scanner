DEARsir,
            
I just finished reading
an article by kenneth E
Arnold in Jan. 1950 issue
of true mecazine.
    
One part of this article is
about the sighting by you of
a flying saucer. Considering
the reports from many reliable
airline pilots and others
it begins to appear that there
actually are such things.
    
Regarding your report would
like to ask you to kindly
further, what you saw then.

I sighted the object flying 
due East - in a straight

The image does not contain any photographs. It's a page with handwritten text. Here is the output of the handwritten text as best as I can decipher:

Circling object a stiff East
wind. It went around
again stopped, & laying in a
northeast, elongated position,
after a period fell & settled 
to Earth, and a sort of
spur of a streamer hung
down which passed over
our heads very clearly and
high.
The page got a little mussy
including section attached to
which I may refer many
other objects I may sight.
