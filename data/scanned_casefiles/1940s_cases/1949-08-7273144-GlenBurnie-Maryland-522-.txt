The image appears to show three photographs attached to a page with paper clips. Each photograph is partially covered with white paper strips, likely to obscure certain details. Here's a description of each visible part of the photographs based on what can be observed:

1. The topmost photograph shows what appears to be a portion of a tail assembly and a section of a circular object that could be interpreted as part of a disc.
2. The middle photograph partially shows what might be a fuselage with a visible cockpit and another section of the circular disc-like object.
3. The bottom photograph seems to display a disc-like object mounted on a tripod or stand with what looks like a brake drum or similar mechanical part nearby.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and output all the text found on the document:

The image shows a long, somewhat narrow photograph of an object's side view. The photograph appears to be vertical, with the object having various mechanical components which might be consistent with interior framework and machinery. It is dark and details are not very clear, but there appears to be structural or mechanical features such as struts or ribs within the object. Unfortunately, due to the resolution and clarity of the image, it is difficult to make out specific details.

Here is the text output:

The page contains two photographs. The first photograph at the top of the page appears to be a very dark image with the majority of details obscured, making it hard to discern any specific features within it. The second photograph at the bottom shows an exterior scene with part of an aircraft visible; it looks like the tail assembly of the plane and part of the fuselage with some foliage in the foreground. The aircraft is stationary and seems to be parked next to a building with a thatched roof.

Here is the text from the document:

The page contains two black and white photographs, each featuring parts of an aircraft. The upper photograph shows what appears to be an aircraft fuselage resting on the ground amidst vegetation, partially under the shade of trees. The lower photograph shows the same or a similar fuselage from a different angle, giving a clearer view of its entire length. Both photos are taken outdoors in daylight with shadows indicating sunshine.

The image shows two black-and-white photographs that appear to be mounted on a page with the word "UNCLASSIFIED" stamped at the top.

The top photograph seems to portray a partially illuminated structure or object with a substantial amount of shadow and darkness obscuring full view. The object has a flat surface with what looks like wreckage or debris scattered across it. There is a more clearly defined section on the right-hand side that the text refers to as a "fuselage and cockpit."

The bottom photograph depicts an area that is primarily dark with a notable structure in the foreground that is lit more brightly. This structure has a round, disc-like shape with what could be blades or fins attached to its top, similar to a rotor. The background shows an overexposed section of light, and possibly wooden beams or framework are barely discernible in the darkness.

The accompanying text on the page reads:

"21-9 "Gray Goose
Photos No. 12,13.

Disc with fuselage
and cockpit on right.

Disc with rotor plane

- page 6 -

The page contains two black and white photographs:

The top photograph appears to show an aircraft that is partially dismantled or damaged, resting on the ground outdoor with a building in the background. It is a side view that emphasizes the fuselage and an engine mount.

The bottom photograph displays what seems to be a close-up view of an aircraft's rotor plane. This image is taken from above and looking down onto the rotor, which is predominantly in the frame, with some clutter and possibly parts of the aircraft visible in the surrounding area.

The text accompanying these images is as follows:
