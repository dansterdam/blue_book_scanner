The image contains a single photograph at the bottom. The photo is very blurry and of low quality, making it difficult to discern any specific details. It appears to depict a streak or trail of some sort, possibly related to the reported UFO sighting described in the text. The streak is horizontal and extends across the width of the image. There are some irregular patterns or disruptions in the streak, but due to the low resolution and quality of the photograph, it's not clear what they represent.

Here is the text from the document as requested:

---
, a former pilot of B-24 in the Army Air Corps advised that he was sitting on the steps of his home around 10:15 P. M. the night of Aug 6, 1947 and that his neighbors, the family, were also sitting on their steps. All parties were facing east. noticed an object which emitted a bluish-white flame pass quickly thru the air. It was traveling E to W. Using his experience in the Army Air Corps he estimated the speed to be between 300 to 500 MPH. The object did not lose elevation and left either a smoke or condensation trail in its former path. The vapor lasted for about 2 seconds. A hissing sound accompanied the passing. The sound was moderate and not nearly as loud as that occasioned by a rocket ship.

The image contains a simple illustration or representation of a UFO, appearing as a dark oblong shape with shading that suggests a three-dimensional, disk-like object. There are no photographs in this image; it is a drawing or sketch.

As for the text in the document, here it is:

around eight o'clock the night of 28 July Mr. ___ (sic) and his wife were sitting
on the steps of their home when ___ (sic) noticed an object resembling (to him)
a giant firecracker which passed quickly through the air. He heard no noise
and the object completely passed from view in a southerly direction within
a split second. He left a fiery trail for about 100 feet. The object
did not lose altitude so he was sure it was not falling star.

NOTE: It is to be noted that the _______ and the _______ live in El Paso,
_______ (Trunc C 29) lie about 10 miles removed from the residence of Miss
_______. It is further noted that the observations of Miss
_______ and the _______ roughly correspond. All seemed

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #69, C50 ~~ Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – 6 August 1947

The reports of this incident and those of #70 refer to the
same object and are typical of descriptions of relatively slow
moving meteors. The speed, trail, hissing sound (after passage --
although this could easily have been a subjective reaction), and
color all check with the object's having been a fireball, bolide,
or large meteor.

COPY C

TO: Director, FBI
DATE: September 18, 1947

FROM: SAC, Philadelphia

SUBJECT: FLYING OBJECT REPORTED OVER PHILADELPHIA
AUGUST 6, 1947
SABOTAGE

Rymtel August 7 last.

Miss [REDACTED], Philadelphia, who is employed by the [REDACTED] MANUFACTURING COMPANY, 1524 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, advised as follows:

Between 10:30 and 10:45 p.m. on August 6, 1947, DEERRED RECORDING she was in the bedroom of her home with [REDACTED]. She was facing north and observed a large white object traveling at a very fast rate of speed to the south. There was a buzzing sound, not too loud but plainly audible, just after this object passed through the air. This white object left in its trail a thin streak of smoke, which was grayish in color.

Miss [REDACTED], Philadelphia, who is employed by the PRESSMAN & GUTMAN COMPANY, INC., 1700 Market Street Building, Philadelphia, stated she was sitting on the steps of 1119 Pine Street with [REDACTED] the morning of August 6, 1947, around 10:45 p.m. engaging in conversation with Miss [REDACTED]. Miss [REDACTED] abruptly stopped in the middle of her conversation and appeared to be frightened by something she saw in the sky in the direction in which she was facing south. She did not give any description of a sky object nor noting Miss [REDACTED] change of expression, but she did hear a slight buzzing sound.

[REDACTED], Philadelphia, an insurance agent, who was a former pilot of B-24's in the Army Air Corps, advised as follows:

He was sitting on the steps of his home around 10:45 p.m. on August 6, 1947, with his wife, and his neighbors, the [REDACTED] Family, were sitting on their steps next door to the residence of [REDACTED]. All of the above persons were facing east. [REDACTED] noticed at this time an object, emitting a bluish-white flame, passing quickly through the air. The object was traveling from northeast to southwest. Using his experience in the Army Air Corps as a guide, [REDACTED] estimated the above object was between 1000 and 3000 feet in the air and traveling at a rate of between 400 to 500 miles an hour. This object did not leave a trail as in a vapor trail, such as is left by either smoke or a condensation trail with its normal position in the air. For about two seconds, a hissing sound accompanied the passing of this object. This sound was a kind not nearly as loud as the noise accompanying the passing of a rocket ship.

September 15, 1947

Director, FBI

___, who is a retired police officer of the Philadelphia Police Department, advised as follows:

Around 10:45 p.m. on August 6, 1947, he and his wife were sitting on the steps of their home, when ___ noticed an object, resembling to him a giant firecracker, pass quickly through the air. ___ heard no noise, but the object had completely passed from view in a southern direction within a split second. It left a fiery trail for about 100 feet. August 6, 1947, was a clear night, and no storm was brewing; ___ was sure the object he saw was no falling star, and he noted the above object did not seem to be falling but maintained the same altitude.

The wives of ___ and ___ verified the accounts of their husbands as to the above-mentioned object.

It is to be noted that the ___ and the ___ live in Northeast Philadelphia near Oxford Circle, which is about ten miles removed from the residence of Miss ___ . Miss ___ residence is located in the western part of Philadelphia. The Misses ___ and ___ who are not known to the above-mentioned ___ and ___ . It is further noted the observation of Miss ___ , the ___ , and the ___ roughly correspond. All of the above persons seem reliable and not the type to seek publicity or to spread rumors.

Miss ___ and ___ called the "Inquirer," Philadelphia newspaper, and inquired if it could offer any explanation as to what they had seen. A representative of that paper had advised Miss ___ and ___ that the object they saw may have been some product of an oil refinery or chemical company in their neighborhood.

Both the Offices of Naval Intelligence and Army Intelligence in Philadelphia were requested by the Philadelphia Office to ascertain if either the Army or the Navy was doing any experimental work on new types of planes or equipment, in the vicinity of Philadelphia. Such was done with negative results. The Office of Naval Intelligence insisted that an explosion had occurred at the CHARLES LENNIG CHEMICAL COMPANY on August 6, 1947.

S. A. GIMBEL, Safety Department of the CHARLES LENNIG CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC., 5000 Richmond Street, Philadelphia, advised as follows:

The above company is a manufacturer and distributor of chemicals. A fire had occurred on a "lamp 🔍" company on August 6, 1947, but was quickly gotten under control. Such fire was confined to the company's premises and could not have been observed from outside the plant. The CHARLES

Director, FBI
September 18, 1947

LENNIG COMPANY is about two and one-half miles southeast from Oxford Circle. The account of the fire does not seem to fit into the general pattern of the above-mentioned flying object, for it is noted that the flying object was allegedly traveling from a position northwest of Oxford Circle to a southwesterly direction in Philadelphia. GREBEL pointed out this, to the best of his knowledge, there're no oil refineries and chemical companies located around Oxford Circle or north of such, but that all of the companies of this type are several miles south of Oxford Circle.

All logical investigation having been conducted, no further action will be taken on the instant matter unless advised to the contrary by the Bureau.

There is an image which appears to be a simple sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the center of the page, just above the middle. The UFO resembles a classic "flying saucer" shape with a raised center and flattened edges. It is a very basic drawing without much detail.

Here is the text present in the document:

she observed that Miss █████ appeared frightened. As she was facing
south she did not see the object after she noticed her companion's
cause of expression but she did later - a slight buzzing sound.
