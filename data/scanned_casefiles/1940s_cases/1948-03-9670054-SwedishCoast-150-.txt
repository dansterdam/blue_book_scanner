The quality of this scanned image is not perfect, and some words are not fully clear. Hence, there might be some errors or omissions in the transcription.

The image features two black and white photographs towards the top and bottom of the page with a rectangular shape and a blurry content. The top photograph looks like a blurry object with darker areas on the top and bottom, against a nearly uniform background. The bottom photograph appears to be an elongated, blurred object with a bright rectangular box below it, also against a mostly uniform background. Due to the poor quality and blur, it is difficult to identify the content of the photographs with certainty.

Here is the text from the document as requested:

---

Incident #150 --- Swedish coast -- 1 March 1948

The description given here is entirely too fragmentary
for any conclusions to be drawn. The object sighted could have
been a meteor, a rocket, or a guided missile. The fact that it
left no trail in the sky argues against its having been a meteor.
Note the similarity of this incident to #145 and #133.

SUMMARY: (Write brief summary of information presented on purpose. Limit summary to the height of three of four lines—10/pt.)
Despite Swedish Air Defense belief that no proof exists that any unidentified flying objects,
missiles or vehicles in FR passed over or near Sweden to date.
1. All reports of sightings in Sweden during the years 1946 and 1947, irrespective of to
who they originated, have been funneled to a special section of the Defense Staff,
where the sightings were plotted. In each case an exhaustive interrogation of the
observer followed, somewhat along the lines of the USAF Project "SIGN". All
information obtained of sightings was explainable in terms of astrological phenomena.
2. In addition, 3 ground radar stations and 2 radar equipped destroyers cooper-
ated in maintaining watch. The most optimistic estimates are that unidenti-
fied objects of highly short range and were not observed on a 24 hour basis; however, no unexplained
sightings were made with this equipment.
4. Conclusion: Although the possibility exists that object have traversed
Sweden and its adjacent waters, no proof has been obtained to confirm such flights in
any instances.
COMMENT: This cooperation of the Defense Staff in securing this information was
undoubtedly given in an effort to help solve the UFO reports made with the USA air reports
for 20 Dec. 47-48 but had been refused as expert license by our Joint Documents
The members of the Defense Staff, to whom I talked, were eager to point out the good
use to which such equipment could be put by both ourselves and the Swedish as determined
by our mutual interest in undefinable flying objects.
I am in agreement to this as regards license and equipment will be accorded
by 725. As to our national policy, as expressed in the National Security Council
documents 20/1, then would the information we might receive from the use of such
equipment have.

The text has been transcribed to the best of my ability, given the quality of the scanned image. Some words may be incomplete or misspelled due to the quality of the original document's text and the scan.

The image is a scanned document page that is blurry and tilted, making it difficult to read the text with absolute certainty. However, there does not appear to be a photograph on this page.

Due to the poor quality of the image, the text is not entirely clear, but I will transcribe as much as possible:

Due to the quality of the image, not all sections are legible. The blurry text and tilted perspective also make it challenging to transcribe with high accuracy, which could result in missing or incorrect text. If the document is vital, I recommend finding a clearer, more legibly scanned version for a complete and accurate transcription.

The image does not contain a photograph. It is a scanned document page with text. Below is the text from the document as accurately as possible:

---

An UFO passes across from Ålborg, Denmark, to Oslo, Norway, sighted a projectile coming from the southwest, passing along the Swedish Coast and disappearing over Norway. The missile was at 20,000 ft and disappeared over the horizon in four seconds. It emanated a bluish-green flame but left no trail in the sky. The projectile seemed to follow the earth's surface.

Note: Similar missiles have been observed at Kristiansand, Norway & Falster,
       Denmark.
       In this connection, it is of interest to know that heavy water
       is currently being produced in Ålborg.

Observers: Norwegian pilot and his co-pilot.
       The pilot served with the Royal Norwegian Air in
       Great Britain.
