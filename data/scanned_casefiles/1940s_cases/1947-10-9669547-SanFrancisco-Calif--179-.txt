SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO Commanding General
   Air Material Command
   Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
   Dayton, Ohio
   ATTN: MCIAO-XO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAOX,
dated 19 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incident summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 153, "Direction
of Flight of Objects," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that not more
specified as the direction towards which the objects appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Settings" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
