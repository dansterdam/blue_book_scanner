DETAILS:

1. Reference letter from District Office No. 5 requested that investiga-
tion be conducted concerning *****'s alleged sighting of a flying disk
in the Territory of Alaska during the summer of 1947. This request was made by
DO #5 as the result of an article appearing in the 22 September 1949 issue of the
"Journal Herald," Dayton, Ohio, which article read as follows:

"FILM ACTOR FINDS FLYING DISC,
BUT PRESS AGENT DOUBTS TALE

By ALINE MOSBY

"HOLLYWOOD, Sept. 13. – (UP) Having taken care of rocket ships,
atomic bombs and Superman, Hollywood now is starring a Flying saucer in
a movie.

"The Army's last decision was there isn't any such thing, but this
has not dampened the spirit of actor Mikel Conrad. He is acting in, pro-
ducing, directing and writing 'The Secret of the Flying Saucers.'

"The star, he insists, is a whirling disc, or reasonable facsimile
thereof. The movie is a spy mystery which also features a blond heroine,
a handsome hero and Russians as the villains.

"Idea While on Location

"The actor got this colossal idea, he says, while on location in
Alaska last winter for a Universal-International movie, "Arctic Manhunt."

"'I heard about flying saucers there so I went back last summer
with a camera crew from Whitehorse (Y. T., Canada) and two players, Pat
Garrison and Hans Von Teuffen,' he says.

"'I found a saucer, I'm not telling how,' a claim not believed even
by one of his press agents.

"'I'll have scenes of the saucer landing, taking off, flying and doing
tricks. The saucer is not created in miniature or by trick photography.
It is a mechanical, man-made object.'

"Whether it is a dishpan sailing across the camera or some garage-
made contraption, he won't say.

"Conrad and crew shot silent footage around Juneau for three months.
He'll begin shooting interior scenes and dubbing in sound Sept. 26, he
says.

"His press agents have seen part of the film. They report it has
some nice avalanches. They did not see any Flying saucers.

"UNCLASSIFIED
                                 (L-8, 5)

               "Locked in Bank Vault

  "The saucer footage is locked in a bank vault,' explains Conrad.
  'I'm not showing it to anyone yet.'

  "The plot concerns a playboy, Michael Trent (Conrad), who steels
   his weak chin and goes saucer-hunting in Alaska for the government. To
   throw Russian spies off the track, he cleverly disguises himself as a
   drunkard seeking the cure. Trent is accompanied by an FBI agent, who
   turns out to be a beautiful blond (Miss Garrison), cleverly disguised
   as his nurse.

   "'We get snowbound in a remote cabin and romance finds a way,'
   says Conrad.

   "Will Michael and Violet get out of the cabin before they're
   trapped by snow? or the Russians? or the censors? Will they capture the
   saucer? Will they drop dead before the end of the movie? Will you?"

            AT LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

  2. After some investigation in an effort to locate █████████, it was
  determined that he was presently actor-producer-writer for COLONIAL PRODUCTIONS,
  8739 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California. █████████ called the writer
  at the OSI office on 26 October 1949 after several messages had been left for 
  him to communicate with Agent █████████.

  3. On that date █████████ informed Agent that his picture, "The Flying
  Saucer," was to be previewed by the censors of the ██████ office at 5552 Holly-
  wood Boulevard, Hollywood, California, and invited Agent to attend the showing
  after which he suggested that the writer could question him concerning the
  "Saucer."

  4. The writer attended the preview of "The Flying Saucer" on 26 October
  1949, and the picture ran approximately one hour and a half and attempted in
  the article, concerned a story of MICHAEL TRENT'S █████████ as indicated.
  locate a flying saucer which was rumored as being produced somewhere in Alaska.
  The Russian espionage agents were also attempting to locate the saucer for the
  Soviet Government. It developed in the story that a Dr. CARL LAISON had per-
  fected a Flying Saucer and his laboratory was located in a spot bordering on 
  Twin Lakes across the Ice Caps from Taku Harbor near Juneau, Territory of
  Alaska. TRENT locates the saucer prior to the Russian spies, who secure infor-
  mation concerning its existence and location from Dr. LAISON'S assistant who
  sells out to the Russians for a few million. The picture ends with the assis-
  tant attempting to send the saucer to Russia and flee from TRENT. However, the 
  saucer explodes at the end of the picture when the assistant of Dr. LAISON at-
  tempts to launch it, Dr. LAISON having placed a bomb in the saucer to avoid
  just the situation that transpired.
  
  5. █████████ after the showing, indicated that the "flying saucer"
  was a figment of his imagination and stated that he had released the story to
  3       UNCLASSIFIED"

---

ALINE NOSEY in order to advertise his picture. He admitted that the observation, location of, and motion picture of the "flying saucer" in various flight stages and maneuvers was not a reality.

6. It might be mentioned here that the "flying saucer" of [REDACTED] was pictured in about three scenes in flight and appeared to be all lighted up by electricity and to be circular or disk shaped about three feet in diameter. The "saucer" whirled during flight. However, when Dr. LAISON's "saucer" was viewed later by TV it appeared to be ellipsoid shaped and was about twelve feet in length, ten feet across and four feet deep. It was apparently constructed of aluminum or some other shiny metal and was slightly raised in the center with two exhaust (Jets) on each side of the raised portion. This version flew on a direct line, rather than a whirling motion.

7. The CONRAD apologized for the story and said he was sorry that he had misled the USAF, and admitted that the article was purely for enhancing interest in his coming picture. He requested that the USAF not furnish any newspaper correspondent or other persons making inquiries with the fact that the saucer is a hoax. He was advised that CSI would not because OSI had no interest in his picture, since he had not actually sighted any unconventional object in the sky.

DETAILS

1. This investigation is predicated upon receipt of OSI Report #2-211, from 5th District OSI (CI), //F/AF, Dayton, Ohio, dated 20 Mar 49, "Project, "Saucer" "; a memorandum relative to "Project "Saucer", from 5th District OSI (CI), dated 3 June 49, and to VII District Co-mander, 2515th Air Force unit (IG), Detroit 32, Michigan, relative to the sighting and finding of unidentified aerial phenomena near Homer, i...ichigan, and Parma, Michigan.

2. Information from the Jackson, Michigan newspaper indicated that one ****** *******, a farmer residing one mile north of Parma, Michigan, found an object believed to be aerial phenomena sticking in the ground of his cornfield on 31 May 45.

AT HOMER, MICHIGAN

3. On 27 May 1949, 1700 hours, Mr. ******* ******, Homer, Michigan, stated that:

"My *** following statement to JAC. L. ***, Homer, Michigan, do hereby make the following statement to Lieutenant Colonel *** as an agent of the Inspector General's Office, US Air Force.

On the 28th day of April 1949 at 09:15 *** I was sitting at my office at the Pet Mil:. Co. local feed ***ier, **d while looking out of the window, saw strange objects in the sky which first appeared to be sea gulls. Quickly going out doors and calling to a fellow worker, ****, who was working in the mill room of the plant, we both were able to observe that they were not gulls but a silvery colored discs rotating around in a wide circle at about a 45 degree angle and traveling due west. They seemed to be revolving around as if they were attached to an axel. I judged them to be between 300 and 400 ft. off the ground and traveling at about 40 miles per hour. After they had disappeared over the tree tops I and another co-worker who had just come out of the plant, jumped in my car and pursued after them on highway M-60. We traveled for about 3-1/2 miles west of town, but were unable to locate them. After returning back to town, I called the Jackson Citizen Patriot correspondent, LOTHIS TILLIONOI and informed her of my experience and then drove up town and informed RAY FUGIL, editor of the local paper.

The above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

5. While questioning _____________, it was learned that a Mr.____
___________, who lives about 2 miles west and 3 miles south of ___________, 
Michigan, which is about two and a half miles west and north of __________, 
had seen in the vicinity of ___________. Upon questioning,_________
established that on 24 April 47 at about 1730 hours, he too 
had been in the company of ___________. Upon stopping the car to 
watch, ________ saw an object about 1-1/2 miles away, travelling 
in an east to west direction. The object moved in intervals and ____________
_______________removed to ____________ and __________
gun. ___________Jackson, Michigan, and was told at one of these 
service stations. She described this object as "shining much like on the 
end of a polished aluminum sucker-rod, or as if painted by a no-drat oleic 
flying saucer", and seemed surprised when questioned by this agent, as 
___________ and her husband live alone, operate the Chevrolet Sales 
and Service Agency at ____________, and both are Rotary Clubbies. 
Their manner of answering all questions was quite direct and sincere; 
no reason to doubt the veracity of this information was found.

AT ____________MICHIGAN
6. On 6 June 1949, Mr. ________________, one mile north 
of Parma, Michigan, on County at about 1000 was interviewed. Mr. ______, 
stated that "On 31 January at Rolland Townsend's land and my 70 acres 
were cultivating corn in the east field. I noticed a shiny piece of 
metal sticking in the ground about 100 feet from the east side of 
County Road, and in the middle of a row of corn. The reason I was 
curious about it was the fact that I had been picking up sickness from 
that area a few days before, and there had been no such object there 
at that time. I walked over and saw this metal disc stuck in the ground 
about 3 inches above and hadn't even driven those by, otherwise to crowd 
force. I pulled the disc from the ground and looked it over. It seemed 
to be about 9 inches in diameter and there was a piece of purple colored 
plastic sticking to one side of it. I did not think too much about 
it at the time, but carried it to the house at the end of the day and 
showed it to my wife. A short time later succeeding one of my neighbors 
came over, and I showed him the disc... This evening I will call the 
Citizen Patriot (a daily newspaper printed and circulated from the city 
of Jackson, Michigan). I finally reported the object to this newspaper 
on Friday, 3 June 49. Then one of their reporters came out and took 
the disc into Jackson. I haven't seen it since. I do not have any idea 
of what the disc is, and do not want anyone to think I am trying to 
cause trouble, but if there is any way that this can help anyone, then I 
want to do what is right."

7. AT JACKSON, MICHIGAN
After talking to Mr. __________, this agent proceeded to Jackson, 
Michigan, to locate the reporter from the aforementioned newspaper, and 
if possible to obtain the disc for study by the A.I.R.

UNC...-
Assat. Editor, for the Jackson Citizen Patriot was contacted and his per-
mission was received over the telephone to remove the disc from the
offices of the newspaper. While talking with Mr. ------ it was learned
that another disc of similar size was turned in to the offices of the
newspaper by an unknown farm boy from Michigan Center, Michigan. No
information was available during this interview as to the identity of
this boy. Mr. ------ did state that an attempt had been made through
the city of Jackson, Michigan, at the local airport, and at Romulus,
Michigan, to identify the disc turned in by WATTS, but that no one had
been able to give any information of any value.

AT PARMA, MICHIGAN

8. Upon leaving the offices of the Jacksn Citizen Patriot,
this agent returned to the residence of -------- and proceeded to
the exact spot in the corn field in which the disc was found. While in
this area, several additional small pieces of the purple colored plastic
were found in an area about 6' in dia. (See exhibit "H"). At this time
Mr. Harris remarked, "I wonder if all this is worth the expense we are
going to." Mr. ------ married and has a family of 7 children. He is a
very sincere, humble hardworking individual, and was extremely cooperative
at all times.

AT DETROIT, MICHIGAN

9. At 1330 hours, Mr. ------ of the Jackson, Michigan, newspaper
telephoned the District Office and stated he and another newspaper
had discovered that the metal discs found turned over to Special.
Agent ------- were used by the Jackson, Michigan radio station for the
purpose of making radio transcriptions. After the transcriptions were
made these discs, which have plastic on both sides, are then thrown away
and the, children in the area obtain these junked discs and sail them.
Mr. ------ said a comparison of the junked discs and those turned over
to Special Agent ------ were identical and there was no doubt as to
the source of the discs.

NOTES: The discs and plastic had been mailed to DO #5 just a few moments
prior to receiving the information in the above paragraph.
