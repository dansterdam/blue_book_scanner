The text in the document is fragmented and not all words are fully visible or comprehensible, which is typical for scanned copies of older documents that may have been typed on a typewriter with some fading over time. A filled-out form such as this one, especially if part of Project Blue Book, would have been used for reporting unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings by military personnel.

REPORT OF UNUSUAL INCIDENT

Unidentified Flying Object

At 1050E, 19 August 1948, the Wright-Patterson Flight Service Center
was notified by Lt. Colonel John Weurth, Executive Officer, Godman AFB,
Kentucky, via Plan 62 interphone network, that an unidentified flying
object was visible from the ground at location AFB. This object, when ascer-
tained to be at approximately 30,000 to 100,000 feet altitude, spherical in
shape, bright silver color, giving a bright reflection from the sun. An
F-51 was dispatched from Standiford AFB, Kentucky, to observe subject object
and a report was to be forwarded to this Center when available.

At 1101E, 19 August 1948, the above information was relayed verbatim
to the Commanding General, AIC (ACI), and this Center informed them that
all forthcoming information regarding subject unidentified flying object
would be relayed to that Office immediately upon receipt.

At 1127, 19 August 1948, a message was received from Godman AFB, via
Plan 62 interphone network, to the stature that there was no change in elevation
of subject object and it seemed to be moving southwest from Godman AFB at
approximately 255°, at an elevation of 90° from a C-47. The F-51 was
flying over Godman AFB at an altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet and was visible
from the ground to locate subject object, the conditioned object. The big
circular thing with the naked eye and assuming an elevation ranging from 30 to
taken by theodolite every minute and progress of subject object was being
charted.

At 1110E, 19 August 1948, the above information was relayed verbatim to
the Commanding General, AIC (ACI).

At 1219E, 19 August 1948, Major Lithnel, Operations Officer at Godman
AFB, notified the Wright-Patterson Flight Service Center that the unidentified
object was ascertained to be the planet Venus. This information was given
to the Commanding Officer, Godman AFB, by Mr. [redacted], Head Astrologer, University
of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky,

At 1223, 19 August 1948, this information was relayed to the Commanding
General AIC (ACI), and they requested that the azimuth and elevation readings
which were obtained on Godman AFB be relayed to them in order to verify
the assumption of Mr. [redacted]. This information was then in turn relayed by
Major De Jarnond T. Dawes and was relayed to Commanding General, AIC
(ACI), who confirmed the assumption that the unidentified object was the
planet Venus, due to the location, time, and trend of movement.

At 1542E, 19 August 1948, Major De Jarnond T. Dawes contacted Godman
AFB, to see if any additional information was available and received a
negative reply.

b. It is doubtful that Venus could be observed by the unaided eye from the
ground or 15,000 feet as it would probably be hidden by the high degree of sky brightness
due to its proximity to the Sun.

c. Jupiter is the only other planet within ±90° of the sun during this period and
its magnitude of brightness is only -1.4 as compared with -3.4 of Venus, making it im-
possible to observe with the unaided eye. However, the following figures on the moon
are submitted for your information:

Time Local Altitude Azimuth
10:00 28° 00' 197°
10:30 26° 00' 201°

11:30 20° 00' 220°
12:00 17° 00' 223°
12:30 13° 00' 229°

4. The evidence obtained from [BLACKED OUT] conclusively proves that this object was
not the planet Venus.

5. Sighting of 19 Aug 1948: Reference is now made to Incident No. 187 and to
an inclosed copy of a report received 2 November 1948 referring to another sighting
of an unidentified object at Godman Air Force Base on 19 August 1948, Enclosure [BLACKED OUT],
this present sighting seems to establish this object as being the planet Venus.

1. Re Sighting of 7 Jan 1948.: Reference is made to your conversation with Capt Scheimer on 19 October 1948 concerning your desire for a check on the position and visibility of Venus on 7 Jan 1948 between the hours of 1330 and 1530 as compared to the position of an unidentified aerial object.

2. A verbal report was rendered you at 1100 hours, the date of your request, to the effect that Venus was not visible at the date and time mentioned. Extracted versions of pertinent information follow:

A. Statement by Lt Paul I. Orner, 0-685766, Airways and Air Communications Service AACS, Detachment T-355, Air Force Base Unit (1057th AACS Sq) confirms the fact that the weather station theodolite viewed and tracked the object; that the object was first seen at about 240° azimuth 9° elevation at 1100 hours, and that it disappeared from his view at about 250° at 1615 hrs.

B. A statement by Col. Guy F. Hix, Commanding Officer, Godman Field, Godman Air Force Base Unit (1559 The) Godman Field, First Kentucky Air Defense Headquarters, 315th Air Force at Godman Field has the object was first seen, and tracked, at 1300 hrs, at 240° azimuth and was last seen at 1900 hrs, by Azimuth Reading of 275° and that, while in color plainly seen with the naked eye, was about 1/4 the size of a full moon, white in color and apparently stationary for 1-1/2 hours.

Incident #187 -- Godman Air Force Base, Kentucky -- 12 August 1948

There can be no question but that the object sighted in
this incident was Venus. It was just three weeks past its period
of greatest brilliancy, and was somewhat from the sun. The close
approximation between the observed position of the object and the ac-
tual position of Venus, determined by others concerned with the
incident and rechecked by this investigator, is convincing.

Incident: 187

At 1050, 19 Aug 1948, the Wright-Patterson Flight Service Center was notified by Lt Col John ______, Executive Officer, Godman AF Base, Ky, that an unidentified flying object was visible from the ground at Godman AFB. The object was ascertained to be at approximately 30,000 to 10,000 feet altitude, spherical in shape, bright silver color and giving off a bright reflection from the sun. An F-51 was dispatched from Standiford AFB, Ky, to observe the object. At 1132E a message received from Godman stated no change in elevation of the object and reported that it seemed to be moving southwest from Godman AFB at approximately 235° at an elevation of 60° from Godman AFB. The F-51 was flying at 50,000 to 35,000 ft at the time and could not locate the object. However, the object was visible from the ground with the naked eye and azimuth and elevation readings were being taken by theodolite every minute and the progress of the object was being charted. At 1219 10 1919 Aug 1948 Maj Mitchell, Operations Officer at Godman AFB, notified Wright-Patterson Flight Service Center that the unidentified object was ascertained to be the planet Venus. This information was given the Commanding Officer Godman AFB by Mr ___________, Head Astrologer, University of Louisville, Ky. This assumption was verified by MCI Letter the same day.

Patterson Flight Service Center at 1050 Eastern, 8-19-48, by
Lt. Colonel [...] Texas, executive officer, Godman Air Force Base,
Ky. The object was estimated to be 30,000 to 40,000 ft. high,
circular in shape, bright silver color, giving a bright reflection
from the sun. An F-51 was dispatched from Standiford AFB Ky to
observe object an[d] a report will be forwarded to Wright-
Patterson Flight Service Center as soon as available."

Major [...] said he would send us a confirming R&R.

Mr. [...] was given this information.

On receipt of the above information, I immediately got in touch
with Major [...] and learned that another report had been received
from Godman Field to the effect that there was no change in altitude,
that the aspect reading was 235° and the apparent elevation, 6°,
with Nash turnout at 12:50 stated that the object was now at 210°
Azimuth and apparent altitude of 5° to 5½°. This information was immediately phoned to Mr. [...] with the thought that it might be Venus.
Mr. [...] made a rough approximation of the whereabouts of Venus
at that particular time and although there was a slight variation in
figures, subsequent reports confirmed the fact that the object sighted
was probably Venus. For example, the reported position of the object
at TIFI was 235° Azimuth, 5° elevation, whereas the computed position
of Venus was 251° 37' Azimuth and 3° 31' elevation. At 11:50 the
aspect was reported as 210° and 5° to 5½° elevation, whereas Venus
was then 243° 44' Azimuth, 3° 17' elevation. The only other
bright star in this area is Pollux, however, no check was made against
its computed position since the Venus readings so closely approximated
those of the reported objects.
