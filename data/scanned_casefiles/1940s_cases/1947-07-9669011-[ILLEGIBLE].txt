The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page with text, possibly from an official document or report form. However, the quality of the image is poor, making it difficult to read the text as it is faded and some parts are illegible. Based on the visible elements, here's an attempt to transcribe the text:

The text on the document reads as follows:

```
UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #5 -- [redacted], California -- 7 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation of this incident.
In this investigator's opinion, there is nothing in the 
evidence offered that is basically contradictory to the hypothesis
of a weather balloon. Perhaps ascending currents of warm air over
the desert could give the illusion that the object was oscillating.

The image provided appears to be a very faded scanned document page with text, and no photographs are discernible in it due to extreme fading or poor scan quality. I will proceed to transcribe the text that is legible:

-----
IN U.S.

Statement Given by Major G. A. _______ USAF Pilot
at ______ California

On 7 July 1947, at approximately 1030 hours, while flying the AT 6 from _______ Field to ______ ______, looking up into the sky at about the five o'clock position from my aircraft at an altitude of approximately 10,000 to 14,000 feet I sighted an object to the West of my course at first to be a parachute which object was almost motionless. After watching it for about 5 seconds, the object disappeared from view instantaneously. I was at an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet and was flying at 170 miles per hour at that time. The sky and visibility was ____ at the time.

The object appeared flat, was circular and I would estimate that it was approximately 3 to 10 feet in diameter.
