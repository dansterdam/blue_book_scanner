P.H. GARRETT
MOUNT HOPE, WEST VA.

October 3, 1949

Technical Intelligence Div.,
Air Material Command Headquarters
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio,

Gentlemen;

My wife and I have a first class case of the JITTERS not because of what we have witnessed but for fear we too would be the source of laughter should we make it public.

When stories relating to Flying Saucers and Disks made their appearance I was inclined to believe they were based on illusions or imaginary objects and like the majority of people did not attach particular significance to them.

When Mr. Sidney Shallit published his articles relating to them in the Saturday Evening Post I accepted his doubts and explanations as they referred to scientific causes, especially in view of the fact our Government denied all responsibility for possible experimental missiles.

But now, in the light of our own experience, I am not too sure. Possibly there are strange, man made objects traveling throughout the atmosphere. Being reasonably intelligent we have decided to submit the following report for what it might be worth.

We live on a high hill overlooking our community. We became sky conscious during the war due to many planes flying over our home in a north-south direction. Since the war, Capital, Eastern and Piedmont planes continue to fly this course. Hence we are accustomed to looking sky-ward both day and night.

Saturday afternoon, October the first, at five P.M., my wife and I were standing on the hill near our home and by chance, I was looking direct at the Southern Sky. Then suddenly, there entered the field of vision a strange object. Sensing something unusual I grabbed my wife by the arm and pointing skyward, shouted, do you see what I see. "Yes I do she replied" and after its disappearance we stood silent, in astonishment, for a moment before either could speak.

This object came into the field of vision on about a 45 degree angle, traveling at a terrific speed, due north, and vanished from sight at about the same position it had become visible. During the few seconds it was visible I tried to make a careful observation as to its general contour and etc.

Generally speaking, the best way I can describe this device to is state, that from the end, it looked like a sheet of metal from four to five feet in length and thirty inches wide with rounded corners.

The image you've shared is a text document and does not contain any photographs. However, I can transcribe the text from the document for you:

```
P. H. GARRETT
MOUNT HOPE. WEST VA.

It had no wings nor other protrusions, neither was there any sound, smoke, nor vapor to be seen nor heard. Only the bottom could be seen from the ground, height and speed made it impossible to ascertain its height or depth. The bottom was smooth remained parallel with the earth,(no waivering) had a metallic appearance but did not glisten in sun light. The color was that of lead or tarnished tin.

In flight it followed a straight course, maintained a fixed equilibrium, traveled longewise as illustrated, appeared and disappeared with marked suddenness.

In my mind I am unable to correlate this object with any of the various manifestations produced by government balloons as listed by Mr.Shallett. The nearest coincidence listed was the case of two aviators who saw an object alongside their plane and later checked with their passengers for confirmation. However in this case it was night time and they were also in the air affording more complete observation.

What we saw was no illusion nor hallucination. I studied medicine and have some knowledge of them. It was no heavenly body. I have read three books on astronomy including a college text and many articles. It was no airplane of common knowledge. To us, until disproved, it was a man made, mechanical gadget, origin unknown.

Henceforth I will no doubt, doubt, the conclusions of Mr.Shallett and those who supported him in his articles. Possibly some of the reports are not illusions nor fragments of the imagination. Maybe strange objects are sailing above our heads from here or abroad.

Yours truly,
[Signature has been redacted]

BASIC: Int lg, 56th Ftr Wg, Selfridge AFB, Michigan, Subj: Report
of Information on "Flying Discs", file INT 333 dtd

(d) Color: A very bright silvery metalic color.

(e) Speed: Unknown

(f) Heading: W-NW turning around and heading E-SE.

(g) Maneuverability: See general remarks.

(h) Altitude: 5 to 10 thousand feet.

(i) Sound: None

(j) Exhaust trail or not: None

(7) General remarks: --------- stated that while traveling along,
approximately three (3) miles northeast on highway #31 going north out
of Holland, Michigan on the 2 October 1949, he sighted a very bright
and shiny object shaped like a dinner plate. Going east the object
approached beneath a transparent cloud, the object did a flip, and
went up into the cloud.  ------ expected the object to come out of the
other side of the cloud, but instead it came out at the point of entry,
and traveled back along its original route and then disappeared into
the east. -------- claims that the object was in his sight for approx-
imately 30 to 60 seconds. It is to be noted that at the time of sight-
ing ------- was traveling along a heavy traveled highway, and approach-
ing a turn. -------- states that while approaching the turn in the high-
way he noticed a barn just right of the turn. The object sighted was
just about the height of a yard stick above the barn in his line of
sight. -------- stated that he judged the cloud formations on the 2
of October 1949 to be from 5 to 10 thousand feet.

It is the belief of the undersigned that there is considerable
margin for error in this report, in view of the fact that the indivi-
dual making the report was traveling down a well traversed highway,
and also approaching a turn. The time element involved in viewing this
object was probably not as great as is indicated due to circumstan-
ces at the time of sighting. Also the official CAA weather report indi-
cates that the cloud formations on this day in question in this loca-
lity were supposed to be at an altitude of 25,000 feet.

Background of the individual is as follows: Spent 52 months in
the USAAF from early 1941 to late 1945. He spent 31 months in England,
France and Germany, with a B-26 Unit, the 596th Air Engineer Squadron
of the 344th Bomb Group.

IN REPLY REFER TO:
DO-1

Captain Melvin E. Neef
17th District OSI
Kirtland Field
Albuquerque, New Mexico

Subject: AERIAL PHENOMENA

Dear Sir:

This office has been informed by [CENSORED], scientist with
Group P-9 of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, of the follow-
ing celestial phenomena observed at approximately 1950 hours,
November 5, 1949, at Los Alamos:

Two bluish-green lights (similar to that given off by
burning zinc) in tandem were seen overhead, slightly
south of the zenith. They appeared to be stationary,
but suddenly curved around and disappeared to the north
with the speed of a meteor. No sound was heard in con-
junction with this observation.

Mr. [CENSORED] said that his attention had been called to the sky by
some children who reported having seen erratically moving green
lights, and it was while he was looking, in response to their questions,
that he observed the phenomena described above.

                                Very truly yours,

                                /s/ Sidney Newburger, Jr.

Dear Sir

On November 25, 1949, at approximately 2000 hours, a light yellowish-green object was observed for about two seconds, from a point on the northern part of the project, by the following members of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory: *******. The object appeared as a point of light, much brighter than any star, at about 350 degrees and 15 degrees elevation, moving from east to west, for approximately 50 degrees, and downward at about 10 degrees from the horizontal. It was first seen by *******, who yelled "there it is, there it is." The other observers turned around in time to see the latter part of the trajectory as it disappeared behind the Jemez Range. Distance from the point of observation, altitude, and speed could not be estimated, and there was no sound hard in connection with this phenomenon.

These observations are being reported for your information in coordinating such reports in this area.

Very truly yours,

/s/ Sidney Newburger, Jr.
