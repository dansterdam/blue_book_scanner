DETAILS:

1. Investigation initiated on 1 July 1949 by the acting District
Commander after having been advised by a reliable federal agency that
unidentifiable aerial objects were sighted in Klamath Falls, Oregon, on
23 June 1949.

2. Special Agents John T. McEntry and Paul Loedding assisted
in the investigation of this case.

KLAMATH FALLS, OREGON

3. On 8 July 1949, SA McEntry interviewed Mr. [Redacted]
employed as CAA maintenance tech-
nician at Klamath Falls Airport, Klamath Falls, Ore. The interviewee
advised that he sighted approximately 4 or 5 unidentified objects
the sky from the ground outside the main hangar at the Klamath Falls Airport
at approximately 1415 hours (PDT), 23 June 1949. These objects were first
sighted in trail formation about 30° above the horizon. They were traveled
in horizontally in a SSE direction at a speed faster than any jet ever seen
by him. They were about the size and shape of dinner plates, appeared
to be of metallic construction, metallic greenish-white in color, were
at an estimated altitude of 25 or 30,000 feet, made no sound, left no
exhaust or contrails, no visible effect on the clouds, no visible lights
or reflections from the sun, no visible means of propulsion or support,
and no appendages. They were in sight for a period of two or three or four minutes,
and during this period of observation, only object passed in front
of it and the objects turned on its clear distinguishable side from view
about 45° above the horizon, Mr. [Redacted] employed as a maintenance
technician for the CAA at Klamath Falls, Oregon regarded to be an
intelligent person who would be qualified to identify conventional aircraft.
He has no definite hobby, but likes to hunt and fish. During the time of
observation, he was wearing green sun glasses. Altitude of the objects
was estimated in comparison with the clouds.

4. On 22 September 1949, Mr. [Redacted]
Klamath Falls, Ore., employed as manager of the CAA in Klamath Falls, was
interviewed by the writer at his home and advised that on 23 June 1949 at
approximately 1400 hours (PDT), he sighted four or five unidentifiable
aerial objects from the control tower at the Klamath Falls Airport. He
stated that he happened to look out of the tower and sighted these objects.
They were first sighted at an angle of elevation above the horizon of between
45 and 80°. They were traveling horizontally in a SSE direction at an

est1...ated altitude of 25 or 30,000 feet at an estimated speed of 500
or 1000 mph. They were about 11 inches in distance, crossed 27% to a
dinner plate, being slight*- sloping, *bi<>g emerged to bo of - metallic
construction, dirty white or cream color. The to of no exist
trail, had no effect on the clouds, made no sound, and to *ias of curv-
port or stability, no visible means of propulsion, no employees at ti... evel,
and no lights. These objects were in view for 30 or 40 minutes, then were
flying in trail formation, and made a sharp turn, nearly 90°, to the east
and then faded from view. *******, advised that both military and commercial
aircraft fly over Klamath Falls at all hours of the day; how-ever, e..d no know-
ledge of any formations in the vicinity at the time the objects were sighted.
He advised that he does not have a record of flight schedules for 25 June 1949,
no testing devices were sent aloft by the Weather Station. He further
advised that the objects were observed by ***** **** who is presently
located at the UAA Station, Yakima, Washington. He also evidenced tit.
when he first sighted the objects, he called his wife at their home, which
is about one mile north east of the airport, so that she might observe them.
^^^ is in a position to know all types of aircraft and is well qualified
on identification of all conventional aircraft. He does not wear glasses,
has a hobby of target shooting and gun collecting. He appeared to be an
intelligent, respectable person who would not enjoy the sighting of such
objects to seek publicity.

5. On 22 September 1949, Mrs.
Klamath Falls, Ore., was interviewed by the writer at her home and advised
that on 23 June 1949 at approximately 1300 hours (PST), her husband called
her on the telephone and asked her attention to some unidentified objects
in the air over Klamath Falls. She immediately went into the yard where
she observed the objects for approximately two minutes. There were four
or five objects traveling horizontally in a trail formation in a south-
easterly direction at an undetermined altitude. They appeared to be
traveling about as fast as a jet airplane. She first sighted them at 50°
above the horizon. She described the objects as being oval in shape, about
the size of a dinner plate, olive drab in color, of metallic construction,
no spinner; left no exhaust trail. They made no sound. They made no wing-
tip angle, appeared to be smooth, had no noticeable effect on the clouds,
and no visible means of propulsion. During the period of observation, she saw one
of the objects pass the one in front of it and then the group made a sharp
turn toward the east and faded from view.

6. Mrs. ****** is a housewife. She wears glasses, and appears
to be an intelligent person. However, she may have been influenced by
her husband's report of the same objects. She has a hobby of target shoot-
ing and gun collecting.

7. Approximate position of all observers was 42° 9' 30" North

AT YAKIMA, WASHINGTON

2. On 10 November 1949, Mr. ████████ ███████, 1411 Jerome Ave.,
Yakima, was interviewed at the Yakima Airport, where he is presently
employed as a CAA maintenance technician. Mr. ███████████ was at
1300 or 1400 hours, 23 June 1949, while employed at the Klamath Falls
Airport, Klamath Falls, Ore., he was notified by a Mr. ███████ that a
number of unidentified objects were visible in the sky. Mr. █████'s men
went up on the roof of the communications building and observed several
tiny objects in the sky. These objects did not appear to fly in any
formation, and changed direction rather rapidly. They were sighted
approximately 70 degrees above the horizon at an extreme altitude.
Their color was white and at times they appeared to be transparent.
They were only pin-point in size and their shape was not determined.
They changed flight rather often and rapidly, and their flight area
to be erratic. To exhaust or sound was apparent and they appeared
to be flying under high clouds. Their means of support, lights, and method
of propulsion were undetermined because of their altitude and size.
Their speed was not determined but appeared to very. They traveled with
some velocity at times. After having observed them for a few minutes,
they appeared to fade from view and disappeared. Mr. ██████ appeared
to be an intelligent person. He completed a course in aircraft ident-
ification in the Armed Forces during the war. Mr. ██████ wears glasses
with correction of -3 for the right eye and -3.5 for the left eye. His
hobbies are amateur radios and photography.
