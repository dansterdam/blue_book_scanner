NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
At approximately 10:15 Pacific Standard Time on 2 May 1949 I was working on my car located in front of my house at [text redacted] Elko, Nevada. I glanced at the sky North of Elko and noticed three objects in an inverted vee formation proceeding in a southwest direction. The objects were approximately 1/4 inch across to my naked eye; were roughly circular in shape and seemed to be made of metal with the appearance of oxidized aluminum. The speed on contact with aircraft at the Elko airport, I judged the objects to be flying about 5 miles from town at an altitude of 10,000 feet. On this basis they would be approximately 30 feet in diameter and traveling at a speed of 250 or 400 miles per hour. I could see no indications of exhaust, or vapor trails and heard no sound and there were no extensions or projections on the objects. I entered my house and returned with a pair of binoculars, but before I could use them (the binoculars), the three objects seemed to veer left to a more southerly direction; all three tilted at an angle, in what seemed a precision movement and disappeared from my sight. The speed of the objects seemed to increase as they started to veer and upon tilting they seemed extremely thin and flat. I was unable to again locate the objects with either the binoculars or my naked eye. The objects were within my vision for approximately two minutes and upon their disappearance I immediately notified my superior at the Civil Aeronautical Administration, Elko, Nevada, by telephone.

I have read the foregoing statement and it is true to the best of my knowledge and recollection.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation was requested by District Commander, 17th
District OSI (IC), USAF, Hill Air Force Base, Ogden, Utah, and was pre-
dicated upon a report to this effect that _______________ Civil Aeronautics
Administration Radio Operator, Elko, Nevada, had observed three (3) un-
identified aerial objects in the vicinity of Elko, Nevada.

AT ELKO, NEVADA

2. Special Agent CLYDE H. EDWARDS assisted in this investigation.

3. On 13 May 1949, Mr. _________ Airplane Communicator,
Civil Aeronautics Administration, Elko, Nevada, was interviewed at his
home, Aeronautical Airport, Elko, Nevada, and the following statement (Exhibit
A) was obtained:

"At approximately 10:15 Pacific Standard Time on 2 May 1949, I was
working on my car located in front of my house at ___________ Elko
Nevada. I glanced at the sky North of Elko and noticed three objects in
an inverted Vee formation proceeding in a south-westerly direction. The
objects were approximately 1/4 inch across to my naked eye; were roughly
circular in shape and seemed to be made of metal with the appearance of
oxidized aluminum. Based on my contact with aircraft at the Elko airport,
I judged the objects to be flying about 5 miles from town at an altitude of
L4000 feet. On this basis they would be approximately 30 feet in diameter,
and traveling at a speed of 250 or 300 miles per hour. I could see no
instellation of exhaust, or vapor trails and heard no sound and there were
no engines or projections on the objects. I returned my house and re-
turned with a pair of binoculars, but before I could use them (the binoculars),
the three objects seemed to veer left to a more southerly direction; all three
tilted at an angle, in what seemed a precision movement and disappeared frm
my sight. The speed of the objects seemed to increase as they started to
veer and upon tilting they seemed extremely thin and flat. I was unable
to again locate the objects with either the binoculars or my naked eye. The
objects were within my vision for approximately two minutes and upon their
disappearance I immediately notified my superior at the Civil Aeronautics
Administration, Elko, Nevada, by telephone."

______stated that when he first noticed the objects they were on a
straight line with the Elko Radio station, and when they disappeared from
view they were in line with the Beacon at the Elko Airport. Throughout
flight the altitude and formation of the objects remained the same and the
angle of elevation above the horizon was approximately forty (40) degrees.
His attention was not drawn to the objects by any special phenomena
that he could recall.

DETAILS: (cont'd)

NOTE: Using a figure of five (5) miles from town in connection with the Elko Radio Station, the airport beacon, and a position at the time of observation, the objects would have covered a distance of approximately eight and a half (8 1/2) to nine (9) miles in two (2) minutes. Essential Elements of Information. (Exhibit B).

4. Review of Personnel Files maintained at Civil Aeronautics Administration, Elko, Nevada, on 13 May 1949, revealed that has been employed by the CAA since 25 July 1941 when he was hired at Silver Lake, California. He was stationed at Elko, Nevada on 1 December 1942; transferred to Honolulu, Hawaii on 13 June 1944 and returned to Elko, Nevada on 13 July 1945. The only physical examination on file was completed on 12 February 1942. No physical defects were noted on the form and his vision was 20/20 for both eyes. Several letters and reports in the file revealed that grades while attending CAA classes were well above average.

5. Mr. Chief Aircraft Communicator, Civil Aeronautics Administration, Elko, Nevada; Mr. Aircraft Communicator, CAA, Elko, Nevada and Mr. Veteran Taxi Company, Elko, Nevada stated the: have know for  and three (3) to eight (8) years.

Elko, Nevada
13 May, 1949

At approximately 1015 Pacific Standard Time on 2 May 1949, I was watering an
my car located in front of my house on ranch property, Elko county, Elko, Nevada, glanced
at the sky north of Elko a rid noticed some objects in the sky proceeding in a south westerly direction. The objects were approximately 1/4 of an
inch across to my naked eye were roughly circular in shape and seemed to be
made of metal with the appearance of oxidized aluminum. I assumed my contact
with aircraft at the Elko airport, I judged the objects to be flying above 5
miles from town at an altitude of 14000 Feet. On this basis they would be
approximately 50 feet in diameter and traveling at a speed of 270 or 300 miles per
hour. I could see no exhausts of exhaust, or vapor trails and heard no sound
and there were no extensions or projections on the objects. I entered my home
and returned with a pair of binoculars, but before I could use them (the
binoculars), the three objects seemed to veer to the more southerly direction,
all three tilted at an angle, in what seemed a precise movement and disappeared
from my sight. The speed of the objects seemed to increase as they started to
veer and upon tilting they seemed extremely thin and flat. I was unable to
gain location the objects with either the binoculars or my unaided eye as the objects 
were well up into vision for approximately two minutes and were gone in the seconds
I immediately notified my superior at the Civil Aeronautics Administration, Elko,
Nevada, by telephone.

I have read the foregoing statement and it is true to the best of my
knowledge and recollection.
