1.  In accordance with reference (a), the following information is
     submitted:

     A Flying object was sighted by [two lines redacted]. The object was apparently [one line redacted]
     The object was sighted from the ground and there were no other
     witnesses except possibly passengers from an airliner which was
     flying low over the area in a northerly direction preparatory to
     landing at the Cow Lake Airport.  The plane was flying at an
     altitude of approximately 1500 feet.

     At the time of the sighting it was dusk; some stars were visible;
     the weather was clear except for cloud banks close to the horizon.
     Due to the poor visibility it was impossible to determine the
     shape of the object.

     It appeared as a long streak of light travelling parallel to the
     horizon at the same altitude as the airliner.  Considering the
     angle and distances involved, the object could have been behind
     or to the south of the airliner and at a higher altitude.  The
     source estimated its distance to be between twenty miles away.
     The cloud banks lying on the horizon were behind the object.
     The streak appeared in the line of vision running from east to
     west for a few seconds; appeared to explode or accelerate, then
     narrowed out again, having the appearance somewhat like a pip
     levelling out on a radar scope.
