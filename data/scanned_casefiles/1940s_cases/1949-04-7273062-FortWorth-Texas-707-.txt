The photograph depicts a dark sky with billowing cloud formations. Some areas of the sky are lighter, indicating either cloud breaks or light sources. There are silhouettes of trees and power lines visible against the sky, toward the bottom of the photo. The overall quality of the image is grainy, with high contrast between the clouds and the dark sky.

The photograph shows a view of the sky with clouds and some silhouetted objects such as the roof of a house and trees. There are power lines visible in the upper part of the image. A white label with text overlaying the photo reads "REPORTED HEADING 15° TO 20°→". There is writing scribbled in black ink on the top and bottom margins of the photo, but it is mostly illegible due to redactions and the quality of the image.

Due to the condition and quality of the document, accurate OCR text output is challenging. However, I will provide the discernible text from the document:

REPORTED HEADING
15° TO 20°→

ENCLOSURE #

- page 3 -

The photograph shows a dark sky with what appears to be cloud formations, and part of the image includes overhead power lines. The bottom portion of the photo features vegetation, indicating it might be taken from ground level looking upwards.

The text in the image reads:

```
INCLOSURE # 4.

- page 4 -

The photograph shows a dark sky with varying shades of clouds. Below the clouds, there are visible overhead power lines stretching across the photo and the dark silhouettes of trees or shrubs against what seems to be a lighter sky near the horizon. There is a distinct circular ring or halo in the centre of the image, which is lighter than the surrounding areas, giving the appearance of an anomaly or object in the sky.

The text on the document reads:
"110-273-3"
