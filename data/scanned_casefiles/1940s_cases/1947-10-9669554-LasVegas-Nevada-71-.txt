Due to the quality of the scan, parts of the text are not fully legible, and some information is incomplete. The document refers to an incident involving an object with a vapor trail observed by an ex-Air Force pilot and others in the Las Vegas area on October 8 or 9, 1947, and appears to be related to Project Blue Book, a series of studies on UFOs conducted by the United States Air Force.

Reports reveal minimal plausible physical or aerial objects. There
a small profile of activity from which to establish a trend, duration,
and point of return for probability for aerial targets, i.e.,
flares.

```
Incident No. 71 - 8 or 9 October 1947, daytime, Las Vegas, Nevada.
An Air Force Reserve pilot reported observing a trail appearing high in
the sky at an estimated speed of 1000-1800 MPH. The object producing the
trail was not visible. The trail was white as a cloud, and dissipated in
fifteen to twenty minutes. The object proceeded in a straight line, then
it made an approximately 150Â° turn of radius five to fifteen miles, and
proceeded away toward the direction of first appearance. The weather was
described as "almost cloudless."

AIC Opinion: It is difficult to understand why this individual attached
any importance to this sighting, and why he did not conclude that the trail
was caused by exactly what it appears to have been; that is, an ordinary air-
craft flying normally at an altitude too high for its trail to be visible, but
in the best altitude range to form vapor trails 20,000 - 45,000 feet.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #71 -- Las Vegas, Nevada -- 8 or 9 October 1947 
(Superscedes interim report of 2/1/49)

In everything except the course flown, the description 
given here answers to that of a fireball. The course indicated in 
this incident, however, appears almost fatal to such a hypothesis. 
No fireball on record, to this investigator's knowledge, has been 
known to turn back on itself. Lasting fireballs have been observed, 
however, that were invisible save for a marked white cloudlike 
trail.

Most fireballs pursue essentially straight courses, and, 
in fact, apparent deviations are often caused by illusions of 
perspective and of a spherical sky; real deviations are caused by 
effects of the navigator's encounter with the atmosphere. To execute 
a curved trajectory would require highly extraordinary circumstances 
indeed, and a meteoric explanation for this incident must be regarded 
as most improbable.

It is more likely that some sort of aircraft was under
observation.
