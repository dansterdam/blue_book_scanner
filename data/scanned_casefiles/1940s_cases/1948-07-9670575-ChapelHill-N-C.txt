The image provided appears to be a scan of a document that is part of Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. There are no photographs present in this page of the document.

Due to the poor image quality, it's challenging to decipher all the information, but I'll transcribe as much readable text as I can:

Several parts of the document are redacted or otherwise obscured, making it difficult to provide a complete transcription. It seems to be a report about an observation, including information such as date, time, location, a brief description of the sighting (including the number of objects and the duration), and remarks indicating that the objects were not observed but found on film.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #137, 137a -- Chapel Hill, North Carolina -- 7 July 1948

This report refers solely to a sound phenomenon. Statements of two witnesses indicate specifically that no object was seen. The summary sheet given here seems to confuse the consideration of this incident with that of incident #138.

Fireballs and bright meteors are often known to emit sounds similar to the rolling of thunder. The information given in this report is so meager, however, that, while the sound referred to could have been meteoric, no decision can be made.

It seems more probable that natural aircraft were heard.
