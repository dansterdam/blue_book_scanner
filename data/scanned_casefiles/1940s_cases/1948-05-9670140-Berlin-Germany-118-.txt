The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a heavily degraded and blurry page of text. Due to the poor quality and lack of clarity, the text is largely illegible and cannot be accurately transcribed. Only a small portion of text is partially readable, but without sufficient context, the text is not coherent or complete enough to provide a meaningful transcription.

The image presents a page with handwritten text, which is likely from a report document of Project Blue Book regarding the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). There isn't a photograph present within this image, but there are three hand-drawn triangular shapes (possibly representing the UFO in question) at the bottom of the page.

The handwritten text is a bit difficult to read due to its cursive style and quality of the image; however, I will attempt to transcribe as much of the text as possible:

Field, Louisville, Kentucky. Cruising altitude was set [at]
[obscured]th 3000 feet. Course was checked from as the
far all foul, [understood tos or] squadron were flying in
plane without incident, to the vicinity of Godman Field,
Louisville. Captain Mantell led the [flight] to [obscured]
through[n] cat unidentified object by the [obscured] [to the]
southeast. Captain Mantell led the flight in theft
disc[obscured] and [reported visible] from F-51 point. At that
he was observed, he inched. [approximate]ly 22,000 feet.
One other [f]orce, landed. [obscured] Formation proceeded,

[and subsequently] crash- [then] a plane was [observed]
That aircraft was identified as that of Frankfort, Kentucky.
Captain Mantell who was found in the wreckage.

13. INVESTIGATIONS DISCLOSED:

a. The party of the flight to Standiford Field, Louisville, Kentucky,
was to return the four P-51's to the Air National Guard that were
grounded at Marietta for weather a week previous.

b. Form 33 was completed by Captain Mantell and weather was above
defined VFR minimums. (Exhibit 1)

c. In the vicinity of Godman Field, Kentucky, this flight leader was
contacted by the tower operator who requested that he investigate
an [obscured] object [obscured] southern final. (Exhibits 1 and 2)

d. Captain Mantell advised Godman tower_that he had sufficient fuel
remaining, and that he would investigate this object as requested.
(Exhibit 1 and 2)

e. Captain Mantell did not [advise] the other aircraft in his flight of
his intentions. (Exhibit 1 and 2)

f. The number 2 man in the flight broke away at this point and returned
to Standiford. (Exhibit 1)

g. Captain Mantell started a sharp spiraling climb to the right which
necessitated power setting of 67% H.P. and 2700 RPM for the whole
man to stay in position. (Exhibits 1 and 2)

h. At 14,000 feet, Captain Mantell broke off the spiral and started a
straight climb on a heading of approximately 220 at the same
rate of climb. (Exhibits 1 and 2)

The image provided appears to be a photocopy of a typewritten document with some handwritten annotations, but doesn't contain photographs. Here's the text:

---

1. At 15,000 feet, Lt. Clements, the right wingman, put on his oxygen
mask and began breathing oxygen. (Exhibit #)

Captain Mantell, the Flight Leader and Lt., Clemmons, the left
wingman, did not have oxygen or oxygen masks. (Exhibit #:)

2. At 13,000 feet, Lt. Clements attempted to pull Lt. Close to the flight
leader and signal him with hand signals to listen out on Channel
D (Exhibit #)

3. Captain Mantell had at no time signaled for a change over to "B"
Basic Channel which is customary procedure for the Flight leader,
(Exhibit #)

4. At 20,000 feet, Lt. Clements advised Captain Mantell in most definite
terms that Stamford had a message and wanted him to shift his
receiver to relay their position to Flight Service to which Captain
Mantell replied "Roger". (Exhibit #)

A few minutes later, Captain Mantell called the flight a second
time to a city at his an airport beside it, which was identified by Lt.
Clements as Bowling Green. (Exhibit #)

5. At approximately 20,000 feet, Captain Mantell missed the Flight
Station to "go on jet at 1200 o'clock.) (check) and as
he mentioned something about going to 25,000 feet for 10 minutes.
(Exhibit #)

6. At 22,500 feet, Lt. Clements advised Flight Leader that he was
breaking out to lead the other wingmen back to Standiford Field,
wherever, his transmission was not acknowledged by Captain Mantell.
(Exhibit #) 

Throughout the later stages of this climb, Lt. Hammond was signaling
that he was having trouble due to the lack of oxygen and requested
descend to a lower altitude. (Exhibit #)

At the time Lt. Clements and Lt. Hammond broke off from the right,
(22,500) Captain Mantell, was observed climbing directly into the
sun. (Exhibit #)

7. From 23,000 feet on, the point at which the two Wingmen left,
the Clements had to use full power to maintain his position in the
formation (Exhibit #)

The last radio contact with Captain Mantell was at 20,000 feet and
for all appearances he seemed to have the aircraft under
perfect control. (Exhibit #)

8. Captain Mantell's aircraft was next observed by Williams O. Mayes, a
civilian in from Franklin, Kentucky, circling and after about three
circuits started into a "power dive" slowly rotating. (Exhibits 6 and7)

The document contains two photographs at the top-right corner. Each shows a circular or oval object with a certain luminosity that could be considered unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The photo quality is not clear, and there isn't much detail discernable about the objects shown.

Now, as an OCR system, I will transcribe the visible text from the document:

----
...c. The aircraft was making a terrific noise, over increasing as it descended according to the statement of the two witnesses. (Exhibits 6 and 7)

d. According to the statements of the witnesses, the aircraft exploded in mid-air between where it started the dive and the ground. (Exhibits 6 and 7)

e. None of the witnesses observed any fire coming from the aircraft ...ing the descent (Exhibits 6, 7 and 9)

f. The aircraft crashed at approximately 1500 EST, southwest of Franklin, Kentucky. (Exhibits 6 and 7)

g. The aircrew did not explode or burn on impact. (Exhibits 6 and 7)

h. Parts of the aircrew Angelozee emergence and G-suit from the aircrew were scattered over an area of 1/4 of a mile. (Exhibits 10, and 11)

ca. Captain Mantell, pilot, was found in the cockpit of the aircraft. (Exhibits 10 and 11)

da. The force of the crash strapped his pilot’s safety belt.

ea. The aircraft was not serviced with oxygen at Marietta as none was available at that station. (Exhibits 2)

fa. Standiford Field did not have oxygen available, however, a bill of lading had been received showing that oxygen was being sent to the 165th Fighter Squadron.

ga. Statements of other pilots in the flight confirm the fact that Captain Mantell did not have an oxygen mask. (Exhibits 4)

14. CONTRIBUTING CAUSE FACTORS:

a. The poor judgement displayed by Captain Mantell in what he elected to climb to altitudes without oxygen equipment.

b. The effects of anoxia rendering Captain Mantell unconscious causing loss of control of the aircraft.

15. COMMENTS:

a. It is the opinion of this headquarters that the effects of anoxia on Captain Mantell was the underlying cause of this accident. While no definite altitude can by ... as the minimum safe from tolerance to a lack of oxygen, it is well known that rapid lowering of the oxygen saturation of arterial blood, as occurred in this rapid accent of Captain Mantell's, will produce symptoms of anoxia within a very short time. AP publications ...

There is no photograph in the image provided.

Here is the text output of the document:

contend that it is possible to remain conscious for a few minutes at 25,000 feet but fail to recall events rapidly or be as responsible as at sea level with oxygen at 17,000 feet altitude. The presence of anoxia in this case in the altitude range considered was very limited. Prior to his separation from the service and affiliation with the Air National Guard, Captain Mantell was assigned to Troop Carrier Command and according to fellow officers had no occasion to participate in high altitude flights.

At the time Lt. Clements and Lt. Hammond, who incidently, had been aware of anoxia symptoms for some time, broke away from the lead ship, they estimated that their altitude was 22,500 feet. The range between 15,000 and 20,000 feet is referred to as the disturbance stage and occasionally, there are no subjective sensations by to the mind of unconsciousness. The critical stage lies between 20,000 and 25,000 feet at which altitude consciousness can be lost rapidly, depending on the phyical condition of the individual.

It is believed that Captain Mantell was rendered unconscious from anoxia and the uncontrolled, aircraft started a vertical spiral culminating into a dive which was perpetrated by the high engine settings and torque. Consequently, the aircraft with its great producing full power rapidly deposed its descent in telescoping and was extended from the short, vertical dive because the elevator control later supplemented by eyewitness statements to this effect that the aircraft almost perpendicular only half way on its initial point of dive to the ground.

a. Assuming that Captain Mantell was rendered unconscious, it is unlikely that he would having sufficient time to recover and abandon the aircraft before it crashed.

b. Is the opinion of the undersigned that all fighter aircraft should be serviced with oxygen between each flight and that to be compulsory that the pilot have an oxygen mask in his possession.

The above would preclude the necessity of a pilot taking any unnecessary chance of flying at altitudes without the proper oxygen equipment.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

A. This accidents be publicized precinct through the medium of "Flying Safety" publications "Crash and Consequences."

STATEMENT OF REBUTTAL

a. Inasmuch as the pilot was killed in the accident, it was impossible to obtain a statement of rebuttal regarding pilot error.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT.

                                                          (A Narrative Form is Required Here. Use Additional Sheets of This Standard Form if Necessary. Use Reverse Side of This Form if Brief Additional Comments are Wished. Provide a Complete and Logical Sequence. Typewritten Form is Much Desired. Insufficient Preparation That is Known About the Accident. Avoid Using Technical Terms That May Have to be Explained Away, and Avoid Guesses as to Why the Accident Happened.)
 
On 7 January 1948 at approximately 1450-1455, Captain Mantell was leading a flight of four (4) F-51 aircraft on a flight from Marietta, Georgia, enroute to Standiford Field at Louisville, Kentucky. Nearing Godman Field, Kentucky, the flight was contacted by the Godman Field Control Tower and requested to identify an object in the sky if the mission would permit. Captain Mantell replied that his mission was "ferrying" aircraft and that he would attempt to identify the object in the sky. Captain Mantell began a maximum climb in left spirals until about 14,000 feet and from there a straight climb at maximum, on a compass heading of approximately 210 degrees. No conversation between Captain Mantell and any member of his flight revealed a clue as to the activities of the object nor the flight as the climb began. The following two (2) discontinuances; climb to approximately 22,000 feet. When last observed by the wing-man left the climb, Captain Mantell was in a maximum climb at 22500 feet, the aircraft in perfect control. Captain Mantell has been heard to say in ship-to-ship conversation that he would go to 25000 feet for a better look and if the other aircraft could not or would not go that high, could not attempt to contact Captain Mantell by his flight were unanswered. His sentence was broken, only portion heard on the oxygen, mask microphone being used and scheduled on a ferry and navigational trip at low level.

Consensus is that Captain Mantell lost consciousness at approximately 25000 feet, the P-51 being trimmed for maximum climb continued to climb gradually leveling out as normal climb attitude ceased/decrease in power. The aircraft began to fly in nearly level attitude at about 30000 feet. It then began a gradual but fairly level, because of torque, a propeller dive which resulted in excessive speeds causing the destruction of aircraft which probably begins between 10000 and 20000 feet.

Since canopy lock was in place after crash, it is assumed that Captain Mantell made no attempt to abandon the aircraft, and was unconscious at moment of crash, or had died from lack of oxygen before aircraft began the spiraling dive from about 30000 feet.

Parts of the aircraft were found as far as six-tenths (estimated) of a mile from central wreckage. The parts were scattered land North to South, The aircraft came straight down in a horizontal position and turned once to the left side. The left wing came off while in the air and landed 100 feet from the central wreckage. The aircraft did not slide forward after contact with the ground. Throttle was set at one-fourth open, mixtures control in "Idle-Cut-Off" and prop control in"Full Increase RPM".

Recommendation: That all pilots be briefed again on use of oxygen and the effects of shock of same. That all pilots be issued properly fitted masks. Another order issued that no pilot go above 12000 feet without oxygen under any circumstances. No aircraft be cleared for Cross-Country unless it be serviced with oxygen.

The engine be sent to Wright Field for further study.

COURSES: Oxygen classes will start immediately, for all pilots and crew members. All aircrafts will be equipped with oxygen. Pilots carry masks, gloves and sleeves on all flights.

The image provided is a page from a document with significant fading and blurriness, making it difficult to read the text clearly. Unfortunately, due to the poor quality of the scan, I cannot accurately perform optical character recognition (OCR) or transcribe the text from this image.

The image does not contain any photographs; it appears to be a typewritten page with some handwritten numbers at the bottom right corner. The text and details are obscured, and because of this, I cannot provide a text output from the document as requested. To assist further, a clearer or higher-resolution scan would be needed, or alternatively, access to the original document for a more accurate reading.

The image you've provided is of a page from an old document that is likely related to Project Blue Book. Unfortunately, the document quality is extremely poor, making it difficult to provide an accurate transcription. There is no discernible photograph within the frame of the image; it appears to contain only text. Due to the blurriness and degradation of the document, much of the text is illegible, and it would be challenging to provide a complete and accurate transcription. However, I will attempt to transcribe the bits that are somewhat visible to the best of my ability:

The image shows a heavily faded and somewhat blurry page from a document, which appears to be a report. There is no photograph present in this image—instead, it's a text document. As requested, here is the output of all the legible text found in the document:

```
12 January 1948

Subject: Compiled Report Concerning 
Major Accident of Capt. 
T.E. Mantell, Jr. On 7th Jan.
1948 at 15:18 CST.

TO: Whom it May Concern.

1. This report will be informal and 
fragmentary but it is accurate to the best
of my knowledge. The mission of the transport
was to fly four F-51 pilots, volunteer pilots
of the group, to Marietta Army Air Base, where 
they were to pick up four new F-51's that were
left there because of weather, 30 December 1947. 

2. Upon arrival at Marietta, the four P-51's 
were preflighted by mechanics from there on the
base under direction of the group. Capt. Kottell 
flew a P-51 airplane to Standiford Field at
Louisville. The flight he took off and watched
the formation and proceed north in formation at 
about 4:00 feet. 

3. Upon the arrival of our C-47 at Standiford
at 1515 CST on 7 January 1948 we were met by
mechanics who told us about flying objects,
and that our P-51’s were after something red 
that is all we gathered. In operations about 
1740 CST, a phone call was received asking if we
would get the Third Air Force, near Franklindale,
the pilot Kottell.

Accident, Major

At about 1600 CST, two pilots, flying a Reynolds
Metal C-47 were on VHF channel, over Bardstown,
Ky. when they heard someone say they were at
33,000 feet and couldn’t see anything. They
landed at Bowman Field, Louisville about 1615 CST

My personnel opinion of the accident
is that Mantell, an aggressive pilot, attempted
to push the object as long as possible, even
though he realized his danger from lack of oxygen.
At about 25,000 feet I believe he passed out from
anoxia and the plane continued to climb to about 
30,000 feet where it done three lazy circles &
and went into a power dive, slowly rotating
to the left with the canopy not out. I believe that
he reached compressibility speed at about 15,000 feet
and the left wing flew off, part started to flaps
and the rest of the plane tore nearly in two with
right rad wing down for a split second, then started
to south direction, scattering the 21 ft. parts
to farthest away. The witness whose report 
we got of a spiral when it started down. Mantell, the left 
wing came off the right wing acted as a fin or
rudder for the fuselage and headed the fuselage
straight down, parallel to the ground. The plane
did not burn upon impact The pilot which shattered
at 1518 CST.

8. Captain Mantell was graduated from
single Engine school, 6 1/2 years ago at Brooks 
Field, San Antonio, Tex. He was graduated at
Carrier operation, trained in the States, went
Overseas to the 14th AAF, from there to the
China-Burma-India theatre of operations where he 
was in D Day invasion, correlated all the Scientific
missions down the Yangtze river. He has been
a war time ferry transition in B-24's and C-87's
Back in the States at Stewart Field trained Cadets
cadets in B-25's and AT-6's. Because about Nov.
20, 1946. His ferrying office was at about Jan
20, 1947, there after further C-54 & C-47 until
he started school on 16 Oct. in single engine
advanced class #12, finished 1 Jan. at
Louisville, Ky. He was federally recognized in the
8th A.F. on 11 Jan. just about the 16th of February,
1947. He started flying the first about 1st July 1946
and until his time for around 18 hrs with or without
his death he was a flight leader. His military
flying was approximately 3000 hours, is civilian life
was around 1700 hours.

Accident, Major

- 9 - Captain Mantell's home life was normal,
he had a wife and two boys, one 15 months, and one
about 5 years, but was not familial; closest friends and can 
vouch that he never had any versions or talkers,
except the normal interested knowledgeable type.
Unknown to me if he had any of this type. His interest 
in flying could n-t be called. He loved the P-51, 
felt always the master of it, and flew, not carelessly 
yet like an excessive fighter pilot. I firmly believe
that if he thought he had any chance of catching the
object he would have pursued it, knowingly to his
certain "end". I knew no man more than he that
was "allot". He was sure, never an intelligent. He 
did not harbor a "flame over the horizon" complex.
If some outside force did not cause a heart ... I
think he expired before Jackie change his flame 
to kill it. Mantell was six foot, weighted 190 Ths.
A dark swallow-id man.

HEADQUARTERS
315TH AT BASE UNIT (RES TNG)
GODMAN FIELD, FORT KNOX, KENTUCKY
A./meg
15 January 1948

STATEMENT /./ SGT QUINTON A. BLACKWELL

On the afternoon of 7 January 1948 I was on duty in the Control Tower, Godman
Field, as Chief Operator. We had been sighting an object in the sky which we were
unable to identify from our position in the tower.

At approximately 1430 hours we sighted a 4-ship formation of P-51's approaching 
Godman from the southeast, heading towards Louisville. As they crossed over Godman
Field, I attempted to contact the flight of ships in the following manner:

"Godman Tower Calling the flight of 4 ships northbound over Godman Field. Do
you read? Over?"

I gave that call twice and finally after the second call-up the Flight Leader
of the formation acknowledged, "Roger, Godman Tower. This is National Guard 869,
Flight Leader of the formation. Over"

"National Guard 869 from Godman Tower. We have an object out south of Godman
here that we are unable to identify, and we would like to know if you have gas
enough and if so could you take a look for us if you will."

The Flight Leader acknowledged, "Roger, I have the gas and I will take a look
for you if you give me the correct heading and any information you have on locating
the object."

The 4-ship formation then continued on towards Louisville. 3 of them swung around
to the right and reversed their course, making good a heading of approximately 210°
from Godman Field, and climbing steadily.

At about 1445 or 1450 hours, National Guard 869 notified Godman Tower he was approx-
imately 15,000 feet.

"I have an object in sight above and ahead of me, and it appears to be moving
about half my speed or approximately 180 miles an hour."

No markes for a description of the object, he replied, "It appears to be a 
metallic object or possibly reflection of sun from a metallic object, and it is of 
tremendous size."

Approximately 1515 or 1520 hours, the Flight Leader reported the object at,
"Directly ahead of me and slightly above, and it is moving at about my speed or
"faster. I'm trying to close in for a better look."

The last contact we had with the Flight Leader in any way.

Very soon after that National Guard 900 who was in the flight with National
Guard 869, attempted to contact the Flight Leader and then he was unable to do so
announced that he was returning to Standiford Field, as he was unable to contact
Or locate his Flight Leader.

January 7, 1948
Franklin, Kentucky

I, William C. [unclear] of Route [unclear], Lake Spring Road, Franklin, Kentucky, Simpson County do state that on January 7, 1948 at approximately three-thirty (3:30) P.M., I heard an airplane overhead and in a few moments as I [was] driving down, and pulling up close to my entrance, I was just entering, after about three circles the airplane started [into] a powerful dive. Slowly rotating at this time, made a funnel going sideways when it started [down]. It stopped once as if it had turned over on its side and then continued on. It started off NW between [unclear] and the Portland Ave Subdivision and a trail was seen. After it or something left it there was a terrible crash. It wasn't loud when it hit the ground because it lost volume.

Witnesses: Wilberoot, [unclear], [unclear] and [possibly a name or location]. on route #100, Lake Spring Road, Franklin, Kentucky, this [unclear] of January 1948.

HEADQUARTERS, 123D FIGHTER GROUP (ANG)
STANDIFORD FIELD
P.O. BOX 1157
Louisville, Kentucky

Flight of four P-51 departed Hastings, Comich at 1312. C
direct to Standiford Field, Louisville, Kentucky. Captain Thomas
Marshall was in the lead ship as Flight's Leader.

One flight was off course slightly to the left and therefore
came over Godman Field, on a course of about 185 degrees. Lt. 
Robert C. Hendricks, flying in the number three position saw an
object C was in the Duck in the Eye type, when I noticed Captain
Marshall was circling so I went over to channel C.

The only part of the conversation between Captain Marshall and
Godman Field that I over was the following: he would like for you to
take a look at it. If we chase it send out a bearing of 210 degrees.
We will try to guide you in. Captain Marshall answered "Roger!" TTY
did you call when I identify this object.

Upon hearing this I requested permission to leave the flight to
return to Standiford Field, the request was granted by Captain Marshall,
I left the flight at approximately 1410 C and landed at Standiford at
1501 C.
 
The above statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Given the context and the content of the transcription, it seems this document is related to a reported sighting of an unidentified object by military personnel, which is consistent with being part of a Project Blue Book dossier. Please note that due to the poor quality of the scan, the transcription may contain inaccuracies.

The image provided is a scanned document page that is heavily blurred and degraded, making it extremely difficult to read the text. There is no discernible photograph on this page. Due to the poor quality of the scan, an accurate and complete transcription of the text is not possible. Here are the few fragments that can be somewhat identified:

- Item 11: (Partially legible text regarding aircraft information; possibly model numbers or identification codes)
- Item 12: (Illegible content)
- "Eng Time" (An entry that could be associated with the engine time of the aircraft)
- "X I do not feel that we have adequate..." (Start of a sentence that is cut-off and illegible)
- "...current and force when this object..." (Another fragmented sentence)
- "...coming to the conclusion that it..." (continuation of an illegible sentence)
- "The flight manual shall be changed to..." (Start of a sentence that remains incomplete)
- "Capts AC" (Partially visible possibly referring to a Captain in the Air Corps or similar)
- "C.C. Johnson" (A name that is somewhat legible at the bottom of the page)

  I, William O. Mayes, of Route #3, Lake Spring Road, Franklin, Kentucky,
Simpson County, do state thus:-- on 7 January 1948 at approximately three
P.M. EWT. I saw and any airplane overhead traveling from north west to
south easternly direction but could note see any plane due to the
overcast. At this time an airplane was heard at a very high altitude
traveling at a terrific rate of speed. In a few moments an object
rotating end over end was seen at a tremendous speed from out of the 
overcast, It appeared and make a landfall headed in a south easternly
direction at a very steep angle. I could hardly keep it in view, it traveled
so fast. No fins were seen. It hit or grazed at a three-fifths of a mile from
me. It didn't explode when it hit the ground and did not burn. 

  In witness whereof, I have herenuto set my hand and seal at my home

and was not an abnormally low altitude (he estimated) but seemed 
to explode with loud noise and flash of fire before hit that ground. Parts 
of the aircraft were distributed over a large area; one wing was approximately 
100 yards from point aircraft first hit ground; other wing, prop; engine &

7 January 19??

An official journal [of inquiry] which was obtained

in a separate field, attempted to pursue the 
object, but on leaving, could only conclude the [words 
be decided upon,

Of] significance was the fact that although a 
number of witnesses observed the sky at that time
some discrepancies in the description of the object.
The size . . the object was round from one side 
"throbbing", and the shape as a "gin bottle,
fork, like a cone base, and I chase it."
According to ___ _____ _____ given to the object being
the planet Venus, because of the time and bearing

and direction of (flight) the time, therefore 
against this

Advised that it was, later decleared that ?

an unknown, this was declared sight, and the
continued observations were found not to have made by
the USAF Commanders, particularly with tracking radar.

- page 62 -

There are no photographs present on the page. Here's the text as an OCR output:

---

During the period of this sighting the Navy was conducting a program
utilizing "sky hook" balloons. The Navy program was classified at this
time and therefore these balloons flights were known only to those with
a "need-to-know". It was subsequently determined that on the date of
the Godman sighting a balloon was released by the Navy from Clinton
County airport in Ohio. The release time of the balloon was related to
a wind plot for 7 January 1948, and it revealed that the balloon would
have been in the area of Godman at the time of the sighting.

On 7 January 1948, at the time of the sighting, Venus was also in a
directional position which coincided with that of the UFO. This planet's
angular distance from the sun was rather small, but bright enough to
be seen in the daytime. It is possible that Venus was also a cause to
this sighting, and was observed by some of the witnesses on the ground.
However, the prime culprit is believed to have been the sky hook balloon
released by the Navy. Captain Mantell was attempting to close in on this
balloon which was still more than 10,000 ft above him.

It is the Air Force conclusion in this case that Venus was probably the
original cause of the sighting since the object remained in the area for
a long period of time and was relatively stationary. The object pursued
by Captain Mantell is believed to have been the sky hook balloon, and
this object was probably seen by other witnesses who described the object
as pear shaped and metallic.

THE MANTELL CASE
7 January 1948

On 7 January 1948, at 1330 (1:20 pm) hours, the tower crew at Godman Field, Kentucky sighted a bright disc shaped object which they were unable to identify. The presence of this object was brought to the attention of the Base Operations Officer, Base Intelligence Officer, and eventually the Base Commander, but the object remained unidentified. At 1445 (2:45 pm), a flight of five P-51's flew over Godman Field. The object was still visible, and the Flight Commander was requested to investigate and attempt to determine the nature of the UFO if his mission allowed. The Flight Commander, Captain Mantell, stated he was on a ferry mission, but would investigate. Captain Mantell then started a spiraling climb to 15,000 feet, then continued to climb on a heading of 210°, the approximate direction of the UFO from Godman Field. At 15,000 feet the wing men turned back because they were not completely outfitted for flights requiring oxygen. The wing men attempted to contact Captain Mantell by radio but were unsuccessful. Captain Mantell made a transmission at 15,000 feet to the effect that he had the object in sight, and was still climbing to investigate. The 15,000 foot transmission was the last known of Captain Mantell.

It is the ATIC opinion that Captain Mantell lost consciousness due to oxygen starvation, the aircraft being trimmed continued to climb until increasing altitude caused a sufficient loss of power for it to level out. The aircraft then began a turn to the left due to torque and the wing dropped so did the nose until the aircraft was in a tight diving spiral. The uncontrolled decent resulted in excessive speed causing the aircraft to disintegrate. It is believed that Captain Mantell never regained consciousness. This is borne out by the fact that the canopy lock was still in place after the crash, discounting any attempt to abandon the aircraft. The UFO was in no way directly responsible for this accident. However, it is probable that the excitement caused by the object was responsible for this experienced pilot conducting a high altitude flight without the necessary oxygen equipment.

There were two conceptions as to the identity of the object; viz, one of the brightest objects in our heavens, or a large balloon used for high altitude experimental flights and known as "sky hooks". These balloons fly at altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet and reach diameters of approximately 100 feet.

During the period of this sighting the Navy was conducting a program
utilizing "sky hook" balloons. The Navy program was classified at this
time and therefore these balloon flights were known only to those with
a "need-to-know". It was subsequently determined that on the date of
the Goodman sighting, a balloon was released by the Navy from Clinton
County airport in Ohio. The release time of the balloon was related to
a wind plot for 7 January 1948, and it revealed that the balloon would
have been in the area of Godman at the time of the sighting.

On 7 January 1948, at the time or the sighting, Venus was also in a
directional position which coincided with that of the UFO. This planet's
angular distance from the sun was rather small, but bright enough to
be seen in the daytime. It is possible that Venus was also a cause to
this sighting, and was observed by some of the witnesses on the ground.

incident #33, a.- - Godman Field, Fort Knox, Kentucky -- 7 January 1948
& discussion of all incidents reported for this date

Incidents #30, 22, 33, and 48 all occurred on 7 January 1948, 
with #33 involving the death of Lieutenant Mantell. Detailed attention 
has therefore been given to any possible astronomical body or phenomenon 
which might seem to identify the object or objects concerned. The four 
incidents are considered together here.

Although the several reports differ considerably in regard to 
the bearing and motion of the object (assuming for the moment that the 
afternoon and evening sightings referred to the same phenomenon), they are 
generally consistent concerning the time, manner, and place of its dis- 
appearance over the horizon. Hour and azimuth are given as 1506 CST, 
about 250, by observers at Godman Field; 1955 EST, almost southwest, by 
those at Lockbourne Air Base; and 1955-2209 EST, about 210, by those 
at Clinton County Air Base; (there, are, as is to be expected, slight 
differences in individual reports). Using this for the focal point of 
attack, one notes immediately that all these times and bearings agree 
closely with the time and place of the setting of Venus. Furthermore, 
all accounts except one agree that the object was low in the southwest 
before the time of disappearance. Reports vary as to details of its 
motion, but the overall motion was southwest and then over the horizon. 
These facts taken together preclude any question of coincidence. Fur- 
thermore, simultaneous observation from scattered locations proves that 
the object had negligible parallax, or, in short, that it was a very 
great distance away. All other statements concerning the object must,

The document appears to be an official report discussing several incidents involving UFO sightings, with a specific focus on events occurring on January 7th, 1948, including one that involved the death of Lieutenant Mantell.

it seems to t.iS investigator, be weighed in terms of the overwhelming
evidence of the earlier of disappearance over the horizon.

The stellar magnitude of Venus on January 7 was -3.4, which
makes it 25 times brighter than the bright star Arcturus. Venus, when
as bright as this and shining through interstices in a host of clouds,
could very easily give the effect of a flaming object with a tail.
Concerning, the erratic motion reported by some witnesses, this could by
said motion of clouds just the object could give the illusion of
rapid movement, as when clouds scud by the moon; of the effect could
have been a psychological illusion; a third possibility, remote but
based on a rarely-observed phenomenon, is that, owing to thermo-inversion
in the atmosphere, stars near the horizon have been known to

known to twinkle brilliantly with rapidly changing colors.

intervals of more than half an hour, would be incredible.

Incident #33 is the only case of the four that includes
the daytime observation of presumably this same object. The im-
portance of the incident is, however, paramount, for it was in 
tracking down the mysterious object that Lieutenant Mantell lost
his life. Again it is possible that the object observed was the
planet Venus, although the evidence is by no means as definitive
as that for the sightings made later that day. First, the bearings
of the object as reported by various witnesses differ considerably,
where one says southwest, another says south, for the same instant.
However, integrating all the evidence, one is again struck with the
coincidence of the object's positions with that of Venus. The fol-
lowing short table of sightings vs the position of Venus shows the
general agreement of the two in azimuth:

A more pertinent question is that of whether it would have
been possible to see Venus in the daytime or that day. All that can
be said here is that it was not impossible to see the planet under
these conditions, It is well known that when Venus is at its'greatest
brilliance, it is possible to see it during the daytime when one knows
exactly where to look, but on January 7, 1948 Venus was less than half

as bright as it is when most brilliant. However, under exceptionally

good atmospheric conditions and with the eye shielded from the direct

rays of the sun, Venus might be seen as an exceedingly tiny bright point

of light. It can be shown that it was definitely brighter than the

surrounding sky, for on the date in question Venus had a semi-diameter

of 6 seconds of arc, or a total apparent surface area of approximately

125 square seconds. Assuming that a square second of sky would be a

trifle brighter than the fourth magnitude, a portion of the sky of the

same area presented by Venus would be about -1.4 magnitudes. Since the

planet, however, was -3.5, it was 6 times brighter than an equivalent

area of sky. While it is thus physically possible to see Venus at such

times, usually its pinpoint character and the large expanse of sky

makes its casual detection very unlikely. If, however, a person happens

to look toward a point on the sky that is "just a few minutes" of arc

from the position of Venus, he is apt to be startled by this apparition,

and to wonder why he didn't see it before. The chances, of course, of

looking at just the right spot are very few. Once done, however, it is

usually fairly easy to relocate the object and to call the attention of

others to it. However, atmospheric conditions must be exceptionally

good. It is improbable, for example, that Venus would be seen under

these circumstances in a large city.

It can be said, therefore, that it is possible explanation for

the object sighted in the region in Incident #33, 8-z, is that it

It is a small, blurry object against a clear background, most likely meant to capture the reported incident.

too was the planet Venus. In the absence of exact measures, however,
it is impossible to establish that it was or was not. (It is un-
fortunate that theodolite measures of the afternoon observations were
evidently not made.)

It has been unofficially reported that the object was a
Navy cosmic ray balloon. If this can be established, it is to be
preferred as an explanation. However, if one accepts the assumption
that reports from various other locations in the state, prior to the
sans object, any such device must have been a good many miles — -
25 to 30 — in order to have been seen clearly, almost simultaneously,
from places 175 miles apart.

It is entirely possible, of course, that the first sightings
were of some sort of balloon or aircraft, but that when these reports
came to Godman Field, a careful scrutiny of the sky revealed Venus,
and it could by that Lieutenants Mantell did bravely give chase to the
planet, even though whatever object had been the source of the excite-
ment elsewhere had disappeared. At the altitudes that the pilot,
Mantell, Venus would have been very much more easily observed than
from the ground, and it might even be that he did not actually sight
it up until he was at a considerable altitude. The one piece of
evidence that leads this investigator to believe that at time of
Lieutenant Mantell's death he was actually trying to equal Venus is

that the object appeared essentially stationary (or moving steadily
away from him) and that he could not seem to gain on it.

In summing up, this can be said: the evening sightings
reported in incidents #33, 32, 53, and 46 were undoubtedly of the
planet Venus. Avoiding the daylight sighting from Godman Field
and other places in Kentucky, there seems so far to be no single
explanation that does not really go on coincidence. If all reports
were of a single object, in the knowledge of this investigator no
known man-made object could have been large enough and far enough away for 
the approximately simultaneous sightings. It is most unlikely, how-
ever, that so many separate persons should at that time have agreed
on Venus in the daylight sky. It seems, therefore, much more prob-
able that more than one object was..involved: the sightings might have 
included two or more balloons (or aircraft) or they might have in-
cluded both. Venus (in the fatal cases) and balloons. For reasons
given above, the latter explanation seems more likely. Such a hypoth-
esis does, however, still necessitate the inclusion of at least two
objects other than Venus, and it certainly is coincidental that so
many people would have chosen this one day to be confused (to the
extent of reporting the matter) by normal airborne objects. There
remains one possible, very plausible explanation for this rash, how-
ever: was the original report by any chance broadcast by local
radio stations? If so, with the normal public on the alert, even

the occmoment aircraft might suddenly have appeared to be strange

celestial objects.

In any event, since it seems possible that at the time
of Lieutenant Mantell's death, he was actually giving chase to Venus (and since, certainly, during the evening sightings, persons presumably well acquainted with objects of the sky were alarmed by the appearance of the planet), it might be wise to give information about this incident wide circulation among Air Force personnel, so that tragic mistakes will not occur in the future.
