The image appears to be a photographed document page, but the quality is poor and the text is very faint, making it challenging to discern the details. There is no photograph within the image; it is entirely text-based. From what can be identified, the text appears to relate to a UFO report, including data such as incident number, date, location, source, type of observer, and other descriptive information about the sighting. It concludes with remarks.

Here is a best-effort transcription of the faint text visible:

     ATTN: MCIAO-XO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, AC/IAS,
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incident summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Forces, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Disposition
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that action in
contact, not alone just horizontal action with the object appears to worry
"Relative to Radar plotting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

UNCLASSIFIED

Original report was classified top-secret. Strategic Air Command 
requested original message be destroyed.

At 10:40 A. M. on 3 Nov two Mustang fighters of the 82d Fighter
Wing were dispatched to investigate the sighting reported by Lt
Com Paina, a Coast Guard pilot, who reported the original sighting.
The pilots upon reaching 22,000 feet sighted the unidentified object.
The object on climbing until they reached 37,000 feet. They objected.
may have to be another five or six thousand feet above them. At this
height that an object resembled an intestine that had been inflated and 
it appeared 5 to 6 times held. more than wide. Sketches were not available,
Speed was estimated to be about 2 mph. Heading approximately 150°

First report by Strategic Air Command identified the object tentatively
as a heavenly body.

Subsequent information received by Lt Roherkamper, Coast Guard Officer
stationed at Salem identified the craft as a sonic ray equipment carrier
used by MIT. Later it was definitely established that the craft sighted
was a cluster of eight balloons used by MIT for cosmic ray research.

This incident is considered closed in that definite identity has been
established.

UNCLASSIFIED.

At 1010 A.M. on November 3, 1948 the 22nd Fighter Wing dispatched
two Mustang fighters to check on a reported sighting of an unidentified
aircraft. The fighter pilots sighted the unidentified aircraft, when they
reached 22,000 feet, and were able to keep it in sight until they reached
37,000 feet. The pilots estimated the craft to be five or six thousand
feet above them. It was also stated that they were unable to see thru
the craft with it between them and the sun. The speed of the craft was
believed to be about 2 mph. The craft was proceeding on a heading of
approximately 150°.

The fighter pilots described the unidentified craft as resembling
an intestine that had been inflated, and was five or six times higher than
it was wide. Sketches were not available.

Subsequently, information was received from Lt. Pickering, Coast
Guard Officer, stationed at Salem. He identified the craft as a cosmic
ray equipment carrier being used by Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The above information was received from Onizier Air Force Base thru
Strategic Air Command, Andrews Field. The original sighting was made by
a Coast Guard pilot, Lt. Col Rabo, flying in Aircraft No. 37241 at 11,500 ft.
The ship was safely tied to a pink ballon [sic] of approximately 100 ft.
with good visibility. Command originally identified the
object tentatively as a heavenly body.

On 9 November 1948 this Division sent a wire to Strategic Air Command,
Andrews Air Force Base, stating that the project, set up by this Command
to investigate and study reports of such sightings was of a classified order
of Confidential and that the Meteorological research work being done by
M. I. T. is unclassified. In view of this information permission was
requested to downgrade previous messages on this incident. Since it has
been definitely established that the craft sighted was a cluster of
eight balloons used by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for
cosmic ray research.

Permission to downgrade message was denied, Strategic Air Command
requested that original messages be destroyed.
