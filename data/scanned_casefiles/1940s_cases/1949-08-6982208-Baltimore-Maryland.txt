The photograph shows two individuals, one standing on the ground and the other seated on a structure that appears to be mechanical equipment or an experimental device. The person on the ground is wearing a suit and hat, indicating a more formal attire, while the individual seated on the equipment is in more casual attire, perhaps work clothes. Behind them is a simple, peaked-roof building that could be a garage or workshop. The mechanical equipment has a cylindrical part and what seem to be wooden support structures, hinting at an experimental or makeshift setup.

The image contains two hand-drawn illustrations of flying objects. The left side of the image shows a side view of a round flying object with several protruding rods or blades, labeled as "ROTO-PLANE" below the illustration. The right side of the image has an illustration of an airplane with the word "GREY GOOSE" below it. The airplane's fuselage is labeled "OXZ" and it appears to have twin engines with propellers on each wing.

The text below the illustrations reads:

There are two photographs present on this page, both appear to depict sections of an aircraft fuselage resting in a natural environment against a background that looks like a shed or a barn. The aircraft pieces are surrounded by vegetation. The top photograph shows a larger portion of the fuselage with what seems to be wing attachments or support structures. The bottom photograph is taken from a slightly different angle and shows the fuselage more from the side, revealing a wing-like structure extending from the fuselage.
