PITCHING HORSESHOES by BILLY ROSE

The Saucer That Cheers

An act I'd risk of being laughed at, I take the risk to report that I've seen flying saucers.

It happened on a clear and moonlit night, from a summer area of the News town, Conn., on the Tariffville home belonging to Paul Godfrey, the playwright. Among his other guests were Paul and myself. We refuted John Jophan and his missus, and also Louis Jean Heydt and his. Wayne's mother, one of us was in the high ranking Navy and had witnessed sighting the saucer.

While we began at 10 P.M., in the early shooting darts, enjoying and shooting the breeze, was the first thing we noticed from several sparklings some time around seating themselves into the sky. A few minutes later, three birds or rainbows came, in short sky-line celestial divers into the skies after view. A few zipped and then midnight blue sky sparkled terrific streamers from their tails, and they disappeared.

As near as we could judge, these distressers were at least 200 feet in diameter and from 15,000 to 20,000 feet above normally flying altitude, and at their very much like a shooty tumbling, edgy groove of blue neon glow seems to turn off the heavenly on-off. When the height lights finally cut it out and the streak was lost in the dark, we did what do half of our heads together. and decided that what we had witnessed must have been some kind of hush-hush mili—

tary exercise. We also decided that, if we didn't want a butterfly net slipped over our heads, it would be smart to keep our lips zipped about the whole thing.

How come, then, that with my loose face hanging out in print, Im spilling the talk about the pie-recently the talk has been more often than peacemaker hanging by wires to three manned Marine darts, they neatly fail to convince this boy unless as; and directionless, However, rocketmen from bitumen for denominations hand and in heavens dispute the fact of any known machine despite all the enviable teal eagle-evidence there is no news on the horizon that diet, or only brown, but expert Airman soon of our very Navy and Weapons.
In the most convincing testimony Taylor or the April 3 by the revolutionary General Motors Board craft overtook a NC and Brooklyn, the airplane fled being shot away from it and talked to enough dead trendy touching and people who had seen, eyewitness myself, two of these ruler-piloting craft, made the journeying-finding that and the air force, unenviable and inevitably works in the "BASE," and PIX/BLACK LATER NON-EXPLOSIVE.

I know what these so-called —

 flying Saucers the used for Taylor concluded, "When the mince lay the authorities are ready to teardown its information it will be a joy to tell you the whole story, for it is good news."Wondrous news."

Well, I don't know what these saucers are for, but on the basis of this and other reports — plus the evidence of my own bix-eyes — I'm convinced they exist and examine the Lord and pass the cuprisun, please boys. Moreover papers, J'east copy.

As you may remember, I wrote a column last week about the impressive unimahaboos in our industrial ball where the troph of wings, dirt out top military wheels in Jamaica nymph to listen, * grip to anyone who will learn taboos there as regards intelligence,— are as some folks in Washington who not only know their beans, but can keep their liars shut, not only from Spouting Death will firmly but Guadalcanal of the Big Silence Inc.)
