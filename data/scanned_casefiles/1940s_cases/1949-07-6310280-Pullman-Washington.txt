DETAILS:

1. This investigation was requested by the District Commander, 20th District OSI (IO) USAF, McChord AFB, Washington, predicated upon receipt of a newspaper clipping from the Spokesman Review, Spokane, Washington, dated 14 July 1949, entitled, "Flying Saucer over Pullman."

AT PULLMAN, WASHINGTON

2. The writer interviewed the following civilians on 5 August and 7 September 1949, regarding the sighting of unconventional aircraft;

Mr.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.

All of the above-named furnished substantially the same information which is set forth hereinbelow.

The date of sighting was 13 July 1949 at approximately 1430 to 1500 hours, Pacific Standard Time. The observers were at the Union Pacific railroad yards; two were working on the railroad tracks and two were loading coal from a bin into a truck. Three objects were sighted, flying in formation, echelon to the left. At the time of sighting, the objects were estimated to be ten miles northwest of Pullman at an unknown elevation. None of the observers would venture to make an estimate as to altitude but stated that it was about the same height as the average airliner. The objects were sighted at an indicated 45° angle above the horizon, and two of the objects passed directly overhead. The objects were estimated to be in sight from five to eight minutes. The objects were circular-shaped discs, being approximately six feet through the center or middle section and ten feet in diameter. They were black on the top and silver colored on the bottom. The material or substance of construction was unknown. They were flying toward the southeast. The objects oscillated and flew at a brisk swing effect as the silver and black surfaces came into view. The arc or invasion of the objects was very much curved and covered approximately 80°. When the objects were approximately five miles from the observers, the trailing object made a 90° turn to the left and disappeared from view northeast of Pullman. The two remaining objects continued in a straight line of flight until they were directly overhead, and then they executed a 90° turn to the left and continued a straight line of flight to the northeast. There was no evidence of smoke or vapor trails nor any type of exhaust. No sound was audible. The weather was hot and humid, with a few scattered clouds, and the observers did not recall seeing the objects pass through or nearer clouds. The speed was constant and estimated as about the same as a commercial airliner. There was no evidence of propulsion other than the oscillating effect and no evidence of control surfaces were noted. The objects continued in flight until they disappeared from view. The observers did not know what the objects were.
