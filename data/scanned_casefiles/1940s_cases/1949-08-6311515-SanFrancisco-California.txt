information was ascertained: On Monday, 1 August 1949, at
approximately 1400 hours, PST, Mr. ----- while riding on
a commercial passenger ship approacing the Golden
Gate, sighted two (2) objects in the sky to be in formation
and travelling at a speed greater than that of jet aircraft.
These objects were oval in shape, thr estimated
10,000 to 25,000 feet.
in altitude, at a distance laterally of approximately eight
(8) miles, and at an ewe level of from his height of
approximately 550', at ship time "two o'clock." to 
seconds until the objects were obscured from
Having oval shapes, and apparently of solid construction,
sall of these objects was to that of a silvery in color,
were approximately the size of a penny, and the estimated
size was approximately 40 feet on diameter. The objects were
moving due north, and made no tactics or maneuvers. There was
no evidence of exhaust, no effect on the clouds, no visible
rilling sound, other than the exhaust of planes, is there was no
means of zero dynamic support. There was no sound, no flame
or stabilizers were visible, and nothing was seen of any means
of propulsion. No slots or duct openings were noticed and
the speed of objects was estimated at from one to one and
one-half times faster than jet aircraft. Mr. ----- stated
that objects disappeared behind fog bank. Mr. ----- called
the attention of the other members of the boat to these ob-
jects which appeared to be in formation, and after they had
disappeared for seven, in approximately five 
formation at the same latitude, travelling in the same direc-
tion and being identical with the original objects.

this time the fishing boat was approaching San Francisco in
the main ship channel of the Golden Gate, was approximately
200 yards South of No. 2 Buoy, tnc was due East of the San
Francisco Light Ship. At this time the objects were approximately nine (9) miles away, laterally, at an angle of elevation from the horizon of 45° to 50°, in a due North direction.
The sighting time was less than one minute. Objects
were described as being silver in color, and having a square
shape, approximately that of a box kite. Construction seemed
to be solid, and the size, as is compared from Captain ------- view was twelve (12) inches square. The direct sun of mid-light
was approximately of SSE and appeared to be climbing. There
was no evidence of exhaust, no effect on clouds, no lights
were noticed, either reflected or attached, no aero dynamic
support was visible other than shape of object. There was
no evidence of any means of propulsion, either propellor or
jet, no fins or stabilizers were noticed and no slots or
duct openings were visible. No sound was heard, and the
speed was estimated as at jet speed or better. These objects
defied gravity.

NOTE: Discrepancies in the shape, altitude, and direction of
flight, between air. -------'s version and Captain -------
version were noted and questioned. Both were convinced of
the accuracy of their own statements.

speed slower than that of a jet aircraft. These objects 
were oval in shape, at an undetermined altitude, at a dis-
tance laterally of approximately ten (10) miles, and at an 
angle of elevation from the horizon of approximately five (5)
degrees. Color was estimated as silver, (3) to four (4)

1. On 10 October 1949 information received from the San Francisco, California Office, Civil Aeronautics Authority (Caa) revealed that there are one hundred sixty-one (161) listed air carriers in the Bay Area, San Francisco, California. Fourteen (14) of the listed air carriers operate on regular schedules and less than one (1) percent of the remaining carriers file any type of flight plan or clearance, consequently it is impossible to determine the existence of any known aircraft in the area 44° x 15'N., 132°-57'W on 2 August 1949.

2. On 10 October 1949 a check of the San Francisco and Oakland, California Municipal Airports revealed that less than one (1) percent of the aircraft normally using these airports file any type of flight plan or clearance, consequently it is impossible to determine the existence of any known aircraft in the area 44° x 15'N., 132°-57'W on 2 August 1949.

3. On 10 October 1949 a check of the records maintained by G-2, Sixth Army and ONI, Twelfth Naval District, San Francisco, California revealed that these commands do not possess a radar installation which is powerful enough to reach the area 44° 15'N., 132° 57'W.

1. On 12 September 1949, in an interview with Rev-──────adviser, Cleveland, UNIT. CONG., the following information was ascertained; On 07 Apr. 1949 at approximately 1400 hours, PST, Rev.──────sighted, while flying on a Los Angeles, California bus approximately the Golden Gate, a "flying saucer." This "saucer" appeared to be approximately ten (10) miles away and of sufficient size to be seen for several minutes. Rev. described the lower part of the object as being cylindrical in shape with a dome on top. From each end of the cylinder, a pipe extended downward approx. ten (10) miles, and at the cycle of elevation from the horizon of approximately 45°. Object flew was estimated to be twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) feet in diameter. Cylinder seemed to revolve rapidly. Pipes were apparently made of solid construction. Estimated size, as they passed from Rev. to West View, was like "half dollar" in estimated size viewed at 20 feet in diameter. This object made no noise and gave no taste or smells. There was no vapor, odor of exhaust, no effect on clouds, no visible lights, and there was thought of objects; there was no sound, no films or stills were made or obtained. There was no sensation of any machine or technical supporting noise and there were no sound waves. Object seen "in slots or duct openings was noticed and the speed of Object floats was estimated at "slower than jet aircraft." Object faded from view. Rev.────attention was drawn to these objects by Mrs.──────.

NOTE: Rev.────is Colored, and his religious sect is "AME" (African Methodist Epl.). His wife is considered a "Prophetess".

California, on 11 August 1949, at 1400 hours, PST, showed hurri-
cane pressure 29.22, temperature 60°, westerly wind at 12 to

6. On 7 September 1949, it was learned from the San
Francisco Civil Aeronautics authority (Civ) that there were 
161 listed air carriers in the San Francisco Bay area. Of these
have regularly scheduled flights and less than one percent
of the remaining 20% use the kind of plane on the type that
reflects on the radars in any unusual pattern. Further in-
quiry at Fort revealed that less than one percent of the 
planes normally using those fields file any type of change 
or clearance. A check with the Hamilton Air Force Base and a
chect on the ivy radar adar in addition disclosed that on 15
August 1949, there were numerous flights made by military air-
craft in and around the Bay Area.

7. On 7 September 1949, air Forde Radar Installations
at Treasure Island and Fort Baker, both at San Francisco, Cali-
fornia, revealed that they send aloft radar testing devices
known as "kites" twice each day at approximately 1000 and 1500
hours, PST. These devices are of aluminum sheet, approximately 
five (5) feet on a side, roughly diamond shaped and containing 
double sets of triangular fins on the top side. These are
carried aloft by gas filled balloons and when the devices 
reach a high enough altitude, the expanding gases cause the 
balloons to burst and the "kites" drift earthward.
