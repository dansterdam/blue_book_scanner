parallel to the earths surface and in a due westerly direction. I wouldn't attempt to estimate their height or their speed. They were visible for about seven or eight seconds and when we lost them they were at an angle of about 45 degrees from us.

They were not planes as we would have heard the sound of the engines as is true any figures that were made periodicaly no sound while there was no wind. They were not birds, as they travelled too fast and we would have seen the movements of their wings. It was not reflected ground light, as the clouds were dense and scattered and these object had a clear sky with stars behind them during their entire travel.

I served in the Marine Corps in the Pacific during the last war. I am familiar with flared airplane light, search lights and similar luminices & wad none of these.

The text of the document reads:

I have a suggestion, 1 out of many before, saw saucer in the sky as the same
time but never saw any behave such as
these or last as long as they did. It might
be altogether possible for falling star fragments
becoming the same path to repeat and almost
erase there such as these did but if they
do, I never hear of it. I hope that
is the explanation of what we saw because
I rather don't want to believe in the so
called flying discs!

I would appreciate any explanation
which you might give because I've puzzled
plenty over the thing since I saw it.
Incidentally, my wife never did see the
thing nor my other daughter, age two, and
the wife still thinks we're goofing to.

Trusting the above might be of some interest
to you and you might offer some explanation,
I remain

Intelligent and stable

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

[redacted] stated that at approximately 1110 hours 17 June 19[redacted], while
standing in her backyard, she saw a large (about the size of a Douglas DC-4 aircraft)
round object in the air approximately four miles southeast of her home in the direc-
tion of San Diego, Calif. Mrs. Selby judged it was about four thousand feet in the
air, and moving rapidly away from her. Mrs. Selby stated: "It was definitely not a
jet aircraft although it's speed was more in keeping with a jet than the more con-
ventional aircraft." The description was, according to Mrs. [redacted] "a chromium plated
pie tin." "It was much brighter than the ordinary aircraft." Mrs. Selby further stated
there was definitely no protrusions (such as wings or verticle stabilizers) as the
object turned in a wide arc away from her. When queried regarding smoke or vapor
trails Mrs. Selby stated she did not notice any. The object was visible for approximately
30 seconds.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Last Thurs evening, June 24, 1949, my wife, my children and I were lying on
the beach on Miami Beach. It was a clear night, stars visible, with scattered small
clouds. Very still with no breeze and practically no waves. It was 8:45 PM and
very quiet.

Almost directly overhead, just a bit southeast of overhead, I noticed what
I thought was a falling star. It had the familiar trail and was falling to the west
southwest.

I remarked "Falling Star!" and my nine year old daughter beside me said,
"Two of them". At the same instant I saw the second one to the rear of the first one
and to our left as we were lying on the beach. It was traveling faster and more to
the south west.

I watched too first star paths cross, but instead of crossing, the second one,
with a trail like the first followed ahead and both moved away from each other, sepa-
rated to a distance of about five times as great as when they were closest together,
moved in together and separated as before. They almost touched four times in all
before we lost track of them, in this manner!

I hadn't said a word since calling their attention to the first "star" but
my daughter said, "They are zig-zagging!" or I know that she saw it exactly as I saw
it, and was not merely following the power of suggestion.

The objects seemed to lose their trails as they approached each other. They
were as bright as a medium star. At first they seemed to be pulling, but as they dis-
appeared, they seemed to be travelling parallel to the earth's surface, and in a due
westerly direction. I wouldn't attempt to estimate their height, or their speed.
They were visible for about seven or eight seconds, and then we lost them, they were
at an angle of about 45 degrees from us.

They were not planes as we would have heard the sound of the engines as it
was very quiet, the waves made practically no sound and there was no wind. They
were not birds, as they travelled too fast and we would have seen the movements of
their wings. It was not reflected ground lights as the clouds were small and scat-
tered and these objects had a clear sky with stars behind them during their entire
travel.

I served in the Marine Corps in the Pacific during the last war. I am
familiar with flares, airplane lights, searchlights, etc., and I'm convinced it was none

of these.

I have seen falling stars scores of times before, saw several in the sky at the same time, but never saw any behave such as these or last as long as they did. It might be altogether possible for falling star fragments following the same path to repel and attract each other such as these did, but if they do, I never heard of it. I hope that is the explanation of what we saw because I still don't want to believe in the so called "flying discs"!

Gentlemen,

Several weeks ago I read in the
Sunday Miami Post that a staff had been
sent up at Wright Field to investigate the
"Flying Disc" reports. No doubt you have been
flooded with letters such as this and I
feel a bit foolish adding to the pile.

I take behind for the past couple
of years that the people reporting "Flying
Discs" were crackpots or suffering from desilu-
sions but now I'm not quite so sure.

Last Sunday evening, June 12, my wife,
my children and I were lying on the
beach on Miami Beach. It was a clear
night, stars visible, with scattered small clouds.
Very little wind, no moon, and practically no
waves. It was 8:15 P.M. and very quiet.
Glenn was directly overhead, just a bit
southward of overhead. I noticed what I
thought was a falling star. It had the
same tail and was falling to the west

was traveling faster much more to the south
west. 

I decided to see their path once they
instead of turning, the second one, with a
trail like the first round good and back
would away from each other, separate to
a distance of about four times as great as
when they were closest together, moved in
together and separate as before. They almost
touched four times in all before we lost
track of them, in this manner:

I hadn't paid to much mind calling their
attention to the first "star" but my daughter
said "they are zig-zagging" so I know that
she saw is exactly as I saw is and was
not merely following the power of suggestion.

The objects seemed to "blend" each "time"
as they approached each other. They were
as bright as a medium star. At first
they seemed to be falling, but as they
disappeared, they seemed to he luminous
