1. The aircraft configuration described in the attached message is unusual because of its apparently continuous plate or band encircling the approximate dimensions quoted are correct, this plane's center of mass placement must be of outstanding importance to the aircraft's aerodynamic problem assuming the powerplant location approximates that normally used of this type and location of two power plants.
2. If no tail surface is present, as implied in the attached report, trim cannot in all probability be maintained without swept wings on the airplane. Even with no tail surfaces, if the wings are sufficiently swept back, the configuration is aerodynamically feasible.
3. In an evaluation of the description, it is pertinent to consider that although the distance and altitude of the aircraft could not be determined, the dimensions were estimated. With no reference object in view, such an estimation, without knowledge of the distance to the object observed, is virtually impossible.

TO: HQAUS
FROM: HQAUS-3
DATED: 10 Dec 48
COMMENT NO. 

1. This office wishes to tender its appreciation in this first instance and requests your further aid in settling the following questions:

   a. Is there reasonable allowances for detection or error on the part of the obs'r. as it is possible to identify subject aircraft by contrails. What is characteristic foreign jet propelled aircraft?

   b. Are there any advanced types of domestic aircraft flying in the vicinity of Clark Air Force Base, Philippine Islands?

   c. Are there any foreign aircraft of advanced design approaching the reported configuration?

   d. What would the flying range of any aircraft, based on foreign soil in the geographic vicinity of Clark Air Force Bese, have to be in order to appear for reconnaissance purposes over American installations?

   e. Is this purported flying range well within the capabilities of existing jet engine, if it were the source of power?

   f. By estimating the most elementary factors of lift which can be produced, by the size and shape of the airfoil reported in basic wire, (by extension of the Francis theory of lift) what do you estimate the gross weight which may be supported at an arbitrarily chosen stalling speed of 150 miles par hour?

   g. Even achieved somewhere within range of weights assuming problems of controllability, stability, etc., to be decisive experimental evidence, what are the striking realities of such an aircraft from the military angle?

2. It is realized that some of those questions are not pertinent to your section, but it is felt that they follow to more or less systematic form in satisfying intelligence requirements. Please forward to HQAUS for answer of those questions which fall within their jurisdiction and return to HQAUS-3.

SUBJECT
Request for Analysis

1. The following information is forwarded in answer to questions in Comment No 3 above:

a. Subject aircraft cannot be identified with any known domestic or foreign jet propelled aircraft.

b. There is no knowledge of any advanced types of domestic aircraft (jets) flying in the vicinity of Clark Air Force Base.

c. There are no known foreign aircraft designs which approximate the reported configuration. In regard to size report, the nearest USSR aircraft of which we have knowledge is a development of the German EF-132 six jet bomber. Although the configuration of the EF-132 is not definitely known, it is not believed to be a tailless aircraft.

d. The approximate necessary range for an aircraft operating from Southern Manchuria would be about 5,000 miles.

e. A range of 5,000 miles, in light of existing jet engines and aircraft, is improbable although not impossible.

f. It may be roughly estimated that the gross weight of the airplane is 300,000 lbs from the arbitrarily chosen data.

g. The striking potentialities of a 300,000 lb jet aircraft, capable of a range equal to or in excess of 5,000 miles, is superior to the most advanced designs in jet bombers which we now have flying. The actual potentiality depends further upon the bomb load; however, it cannot be estimated here.

2. This R&R has not been forwarded to MCIAIS inasmuch as all questions in Comment No 3 have been covered.

3. As an expedient measure in handing similar matters in the future, it is recommended that this type of problem be first discussed verbally between members of this Section and MCIAO.

(7) Maneuverability: according to witness, object was
very maneuverable, due to its speed, and the way it moved 
in and out of the clouds.

(8) Altitude: According to observer, altitude appeared 
to be from three (3) to six (6) miles high.

(9) Sound: Observer claims he could hear a single roar,
as a single plane in the sky would make.

(10) Exhaust trail: Object appeared to leave an exhaust 
trail from the tail-end of a vanished object, the 
observer said, "It appeared to be sky writing."

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

    The following is an eye-witness report of a strange airborne craft
or object;

    On November 13, 1948, between 1200 and 1400 I saw a strange object in
the sky.

    I was seated in the doorway of the Radar (Theatre on the north side,
smoking and watching some cloud formations in the Northeast. All at once,
a white pencil materialised and commenced to lying due west in a northern di-
rection. I thought at first it was a plane, a very long plane. Then it
grows as it continued to advance as a whole unit, Well, for it was so long,
I know it could not be no plane (There is no planes around my mind; further-
more, it moved very very fast, it covered lots of sky in a short time. I thought 
collision with a few targets. The object advanced to a place, It then be-
gan getting closer, getting large cloud formations then vanished, flashes white 
come out of that cloud, it got all the time, I thought, maybe when it
came out on the Northwest by North side, it will be better late then. It
before it disappeared in the same cloud formation.

    The following is as good a description of what I saw, as the whole
thing was out of normal comprehension, I hope to be excused by my lacky
to bring details attention to it to others who were nearby.

    It was non-metal (the fact that it glistened as it moved), no more
than one or two miles high, my assistant are, just substance), as it 
moved, I got a clear view broadside to me, and as it turned back into the same
station, two fins, and very short lead-on, ther's no definitely a ring ov-
with object with times besides short. Important to the length of T, I saw for
the third time, the second time it appeared was to the cloud formation they 
to get taking the air come out directly facing me, and shots and farther away,
(Understand, all thing, it was closer than at any other time T was forth to
a clear sky would make, I could hear a single roar, as a single plane in
a plane, but would standing, look for another plane, or maybe I should say
the object I was watching.)

    All this I did see; I could also tell that the side wasn't a smooth sur-
face, as it came toward the third time -- it if the side was a smooth run-
by windows. This seemed also was short, in comparison with longth, but, broken
- it would be impossible to estimate the length of this object, but, in com-
parison, it would be.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #XX - Clark AF Base, Philippine Islands - 12 November 1948

Two things enter heavily into any possible interpretation 
of this incident: the reported maneuverability of the object, and
the character evaluation of the witness.

If the facts add up as stated, and there is no astronomical
explanation for the object observed. A few points favor its having
been a daylight meteor: the snow-white color, speed faster than
that of a jet plane, roaring noise, similarity to "skywriting," and
the brightness of the observation. No contrails, however, if really
performed, expose it strenuously.

The question is, did this object actually maneuver in and
out of a cloud bank...? Also, did it make turns or 180° or more? It
is possible that such impressions were merely illusions. The witness
saw the object intermittently through clouds. It is not clear whether
he ever saw it against a cloud background or only in the sky gaps
between clouds, a fact which is highly important. If he saw it only
in breaks between clouds, this fact, coupled with its great speed,
makes it clear that only momentary impressions could be obtained.

Such observations, by an untrained observer, might form a des-
cription that is extremely unlike the facts.

The impression of a fuselage with windows could even more 
easily have been a figment of the imagination.

Unless more specific information surfaces, a final conclu-
sion is unavailable, the present Investigator cannot say whether any
astronomical explanation is possible, or not.

Incident: 206

Sgt █████ stated he was watching some cloud formations in the North-
east portion of the sky when he observed a white stick materialize and
lengthen out. At first he thought it was sky-writing but as it con-
tinued to advance he thought it appeared as a whole unit. Object 
pursued a northwestern direction and entered a very large cloud formation.
As the object emerged on the northwest by north side the object appeared
larger and he was able to get a clearer view. The object appeared snow-
white. At one time Sgt █████ was able to obtain a side-view impression.
It seemed as if the side surface was broken by windows. The nose, too,
was short in comparison to the length. There was definitely a wing
formation - low wing and very short in comparison to the length of the
fuselage. Sgt █████ perceived the object six times thru the cloud
formation in various attitudes - see attached drawings. Sgt █████
in his drawing estimates the length of the fuselage to be 300 feet.
However, he stated that it would be impossible for him to estimate
the length of the object if the craft was using a rear type propulsion
and utilizing a fuel that left a white exhaust. Fuselage apparently
had no tail assembly. It appeared as a straight body tapering off from
directly above the wings to a very small point.

Evaluation: D-5 - Sgt █████ maintained a very cool point.
