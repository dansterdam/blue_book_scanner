Interrogation Report [REDACTED]
27 Jul 48

1. Capt M. Martin, Lt. C. R. Glasserbrock, and Lt. T. S. Rygmyrton of the Air
Technical Intelligence Branch, Operations Section, Technical Intelligence Divi-
sion, departed Patterson Field, Ohio, 24 Jul 1948, arrived Bismarck, North
Dakota, 1420 the same day. Contacted Mr. [REDACTED] home by telephone and
were informed that Mr. [REDACTED] would not be available until approximately 1700.

2. Arrived at Mr. [REDACTED] home at approximately 1630. Conferred with
Mr. [REDACTED] for approximately two (2) hours attempting to acquire all avail-
able information. Mr. [REDACTED] seemed sincere in his statements, however,
he took quite some time to answer specific questions. He answered most questions
with generalities. It is believed he tried to give correct answers but was un-
sure of himself. He also stated that most of the answers given by him in his letter
to the Technical Intelligence Division were mere speculations and that he believed
he was wrong with several plausible answers to specific accuracy.

3. Departed Bismarck, North Dakota, 1300, 25 Jul 1948. Arrived Aberdeen,
South Dakota, 1520, 25 Jul 1948. Contacted Mr. [REDACTED] home not expec-
tatively 1630 by telephone. At that time no other information is that he was out
of town and would return at approximately 1930. Mr. [REDACTED] then called back
at about 2000 and arrangements were made to visit with him the following day.

4. Arrangements were made for transportation to Ecolia, South Dakota, Mr.
[REDACTED] and his wife were contacted at approximately 1100, on the 26th of
Jul 1948. The conference with Mr. [REDACTED] was approximately one hour
and fifteen minutes, was conferred with Mr. [REDACTED] approximately
twenty-five minutes. [REDACTED] were informed that Mr. [REDACTED] was quite
apprehensive that they were military men. Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED] did answer the
examiners with trick statements, whereas the skeptics continued to give sincere an-
swers to the best of their ability. Mr. [REDACTED] seemed to have a
background which would qualify him as a fairly reliable observer of the incident.
Mrs. [REDACTED] kept a constant watch on the object whereas Mr. [REDACTED] 
was driving. Several stops were made and their conflicting views as recorded ant
they watched the object with intense interest. It is believed that the intense
interest of the two witnesses makes their observations fairly reliable.

5. Departed Aberdeen, South Dakota, 1630 on 25 Jul 1948. Arrived Patterson
Field 2200, 26 Jul 1948.

"Description of object as stated by Mr.

First sighting was at approximately 1125 on 30 June 1947. The object was thought to be a star. Being an amateur astronomer, it aroused the curiosity of Mr. because it was possible to see more characteristics to the object. It had a round appearance but was not sharply enough defined to positively state that the object was round. Upon observing the object for a short while, it appeared to change its shape having a tendency to flatten out in spots and then return to a round shape again. There was no definite pattern, size, or circular sections of shape of the object. The appearance indicated that it was a Forman at an attempt to retain a circular shape. The main tendency was toward roundness. The witness could not state whether or not the object had depth to it.

The object was viewed for approximately two hours. During that period of time the witnesses moved approximately 22 miles due north and then to a point approximately 13 miles west at an approximate 90° angle to the original direction of travel. The object remained in apparent constant position. At first sighting the object appeared at a compass heading of approximately 50°. At the last gazing the compass heading was 793°(?), lower by 5°. The vertical angle of sight remained constant at about 75° to 80°. The observation of the object and terrain memories, witnesses decided that the altitude of the object would be approximately 10 miles. The spot light and focals of the various sighting were as shown in the original correspondence and map. Mr. was rather excited at the times and positions originally listed were correct. Readings were checked against his wife's watch which was checked with radio time signal at 1730 that night, and found to be correct.

There was no change in appearance of the object except for an increase in size, until the last sighting at 1327 when the object started to break up. The object had a definite polished aluminum color and showed no dark or bright spots. Where the smaller object or lesser portion broke into the estimated diameter of the original was thought to be approximately 2000 to 5000 feet. Just prior to the breaking up of the mass, it took on a fuzzy appearance resembling a large cluster of golf balls in a round pyram. The mass seemed to take on a box shape. Suddenly one ball about 1/12th the size of the original mass dropped from the center of the mass to a distance about 10 times the original diameter of the mass and hung in space. Immediately, two balls of the same size as the first two mentioned took off to the right. However two balls repelled and came to a quick stop when they reached a distance from the center of the mass equal to the first. The large balls formed an inverted isometric triangle with the first ball in the center. There were slipet with trails visible from the three while assuming their new positions. Shortly thereafter the larger remaining mass tended to break up into equal thirds with the lower sections going downward and the upper section going up forming an upright triangle. During the breaking up of the central mass, a whitish haze was apparent toward the center of the triangle form some of the moving birds. Each third appeared to have two to three sides which appeared to be the size of aluminum specks. It took approximately 7 to"

30 seconds for the central mass to take on its new configuration after the three larger balls took up their new positions. The color of the spheres/balls local to the squadron initially was a very definite orange, breaking up period. The small spheres appeared to be of two classifications, very small and fine specks. The smaller of the small spheres appeared to be approximately 1/10th the size of the large spheres. The other spheres were approximately 1/5th to 1/4th the size of the large spheres. No estimate of ratio between the numbers of the two sizes of small spheres could be made.

Upon assuming their new configuration, the complete mass began to recede from view. The small particles became invisible after one or two minutes. The three larger balls did not seem to start to recede until after the smaller ones were no longer visible. It took about four minutes for the three to disappear after the smaller ones were no longer visible. There was no explosion. There just seemed to be a receding out of sight with the large balls retaining their isosceles triangle positions.

---

The following statements by Mrs. [REDACTED] were not in accord with Mr. [REDACTED]. Except for the following variations, the statements and descriptions of the witnesses were almost identical.

1. The original mass varied from round to oblong with the distortion always in the same specific direction. The color was described as a polished aluminum with a very light shimmering on it, similar to the heat waves one sees on a hot day above bituminous, high, oily asphalt.

2. The original size of the mass was about the size of a quarter. Prior to break-up, the mass had assumed a size 15 to 20 times larger than the original size. The resemblance now just prior to break-up of this mass was compared to the size of a hand ball being caught by the first baseman as viewed from the third base position.

3. The first impression of the balls dropping from the center of the mass was similar to a parachutist coming out, however, it did not take on a parasol shape but assumed a ball shape. The three balls moving away from the mass retained their round contours. Upon start when they reached their new positions, rapidly no one was aware of stop when the breaking balls appeared to have a more whitish appearance with less glare or shimmer. The color was described as being a very bright white. The comparison of the large balls to the small ones was stated as comparison of a baseball (initial ball) and a dime as traveled at a distance. Mrs. [REDACTED] believed that the small balls were all of the same size. Mrs. [REDACTED] did not recall any trail except a foggy haze behind the small balls during their break up. Then the small balls very fast left the view, a trail haze was seen at this moment until all the large mass disappeared before the large balls had receded from sight.

The text on the document reads:

First part of break up
Break up completed.

The drawings seem to depict a sequential series of events, potentially indicating the process of an object breaking apart. There are a number of circular shapes, with one in the center that is more detailed, as if to show an object disintegrating or changing form over time.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a photocopy or a scanned image of a map. Due to the quality of the image, the text is not very clear, which makes it hard to read the fine details. However, the following text can be deciphered from the document with some degree of confidence:

The image also includes grid lines, county boundaries or jurisdiction divisions within a region, and it seems to have directional notation indicating north. The text "SD/PER WIND 3 MAY" might suggest a record linked to weather or wind conditions on May 3rd in South Dakota ("SD"), but this interpretation is speculative due to the limited legibility of the document.

Incident #141 -- Houle, South Dakota -- 30 June 1948

The description given here obviously does not answer
to that of a star, or of any other astronomical body.

In all probability the object was a cluster of bal[loons],
carrying perhaps, cosmic ray apparatus. This would account for
the starlike appearance and the eventual breaking up into parts.

Old Custom House

St. Louis 1, Mo.

Attn: Intelligence Officer

Dear Sir:

I am submitting this information to you in the belief that it may be
of value to this country's information.  I just talked by phone to
Chief ****, *** of Coast Guard Station, H. F. 3, Y., near Groton, S. D.,
who advised me to write to you.  I gave him a very limited account of what
I observed, because I did not know for sure, whether this information
might prove confidential.

I have been living in Cleveland, Ohio, for the past 3 years.  My home
which I was returning to, is Keala, South Dakota, where I now am.  The
observation was made on June 30, 1950, between Watertown, S.D., and
Webster, S. D.  I was traveling on Highway 81, from Watertown, to Webster
(an isolated small hill) in my car when I happened to be when a small
plane.  I noticed a small (round) spot in the sky, looking to the north it
was 20° to the right and about 20° north of zenith.  (Barely overhead).
I thought at first it was a slow moving powered plane, very high.  I watched
it for a minute and noticed no movement, my next conclusion was that it
might be a strato jet and started timing to check its motion.  15 minutes
later I was still in looking (my wife watched it out the window constantly)
A Airplane #2 appeared and I realized down to the depth and lined it up with a
telephone wire and watched very carefully for any movement for 5 minutes.  No
movement detected, I decided it must be a bright star (Venus or Sirius)
neither should have been at that spot at that time, and I had never seen a
star at noon.  I made two more stops as arrows 73 and 74.  Position 3 was
the same as Arrow #5 showed for 93 and was stationary all the time.
In light and the car was stopped, I called attention to the object
to the proprietor and the gas station (place Amsden's store) no one so
coming out watched for their deductions -

Proprietor: Star
1st Customer: Star
2nd Customer: Can't be a star - possible
3rd Customer: Never saw anything like this

All Hope you will look into this and at least be positive.

This territory is very thinly populated and these people are my only witnesses.

We continued north (making innumerable observations at a few minute intervals. No change in appearance or position was noted, except it appeared to be a cluster of parts or pieces instead of one solid piece:

thus;

The next stop of importance was at arrow #6 on Highway #12. The location was nearly exactly the same, a couple of degrees closer to overhead if anything. It was slightly smaller and its shape was not constant. It appeared to very slowly change from __________ to _________. It was just about to _______ when we both

got into the car when my wife said; "Look, a piece fell off." I would have sworn at that moment it was a parachutes. (Parachutes don't operate 50 to 150 miles altitudes.) In the next 2-1/2 minutes, three only spots started to very slowly disintegrate. Three larger parts moved away slowly from the mass and formed a perfect isometric triangle, then remaining mass slowly moved into hundreds of small parts, seemingly leaving very faint trails of vapor. Although points that high was very apparent - 50 to 150 miles. The smaller parts at this point the object was, seemingly leaving very faint trails of vapor. Although point the object was, seemingly leaving very faint trails of vapor slowly disappearing as if moving upwards - 50 to 150 miles. The smaller parts observer, the three remaining parts continued to move apart and hold their constant position of a perfect triangle, gradually getting smaller and fainter until they disappeared about 9 minutes after the initial break up. It could easily be seen that the parts were moving away from the earth. No other point was that just was had - after this at arrow #6. My observations at this point were that it could not be anything terrestrial.

The day was brilliantly clear, no cloud or haze, visible above the horizon, Wind velocity about 3 MPH in direction shown on map.

Times are shown below for different arrow locations at stopping time: 

#1 - 11:25 A.M.
#2 - 11:31
#3 - 11:37
