They're Spherical, Fast As Jets

Flying Discs Come To N. O.

The flying discs have come to New Orleans at last.

But here they're not like saucers. They were spherical.

Mr. Schulmkmpp, assistant U. S. attorney, said that he saw a "round, luminous" object flying with jet-like speed across Lake Pontchartrain Sunday.

The object, "which was trailing what appeared to be gases in matter, a brilliant orange in color," was moving southeast in the general direction of Michoud, he said.

It was flying on a straight level course at an altitude of about 2500 feet, he declared.

Mr. Schulmknpp, who is a Navy veteran and a licensed pilot with several hundred flying hours, said he was convinced that what he saw was a man-made aircraft.

He described his experience as follows:

"At 2:55 a. m. I was driving along the lakefront from West End toward the New Orleans Airport.

"I had just passed the Levee Board police station, when I looked to my left out over the lake.

"I saw in the sky a moving object, spherical in shape and trailing what appeared to be gasses matter, in color was brilliant orange which.

"The object appeared to be about the size of a volley ball. It approached the shore line from a northwest direction. It was flying in a southeasterly direction in the general vicinity of the Higgins Michoud plant.

"The object appeared to be solid.

"Its course through the sky resembled the smooth, swift flight of a jet powered aircraft in straight level flight. I would put the speed at at least 600 miles per hour.

"The object was in full view for at least 30 seconds. It did not plunge earthward in the fashion of a meteor and its general aspect, course and behaviour led me to believe that it was not an astronomical phenomenon."

Mr. Schulmkmpp said he did not know whether the object made any sound because passing cars drowned out any other noises he might have heard.

He said he heard that the object was spotted by a watchman at Higgins, about the same time that he saw it.

STATEMENT

On 6 August 1949 at 2000 hours, my wife, Delo Probits and her
folks, Dr, and Mrs. C. J. Stanton and I were standing at the sea-
wall at Biloxi enjoying the gulf air. At a time while looking
out over the gulf toward the Southwest., my eye happened to catch
a bright spherical object. I turned to the East and I saw the
object which appeared as a brilliant sphere, the size of a wasps
paper basket. Its direction of travel was from over KAFB towards
a 180 degree heading, traveling at a speed of 600 to 800 miles per
hour. The course of travel was in an unusually horizontal plane.
The object stayed in view for approximately thirty (30) seconds
and then disappeared out of sight over the gulf. My wife had also 
witnessed part of this display, and immediately we all discussed 
the matter for some time. I believe the object was too large to
have been a firefly presenting an optical illusion. I also believe
that it was not a meteor fragment because of its bright glowing
nature so close to Earth. Due to the large amount of oxygen pres-
ent, I believe a meteor would have burnt itself out before ascent
to such low altitudes.

HQ, 1st Air Force, Sious AFRB,					4-92			2
New Rochelle, New York

TO (Unit or Place)			DATE
					3 August 1949

A visit was made to Mr. and Mrs. of Street,
Jackson Heights---Long Island, on Saturday, the 3d of September,
at 10:00 A.M. for the purpose of investigating the aforementioned special
report the PM by them of an unidentified object, airborne, composed of a
"ring also of fly-by-on of our T-6." was formerly a captain in 
fighter class, and is an instrument dealer, formerly employed by the Curtiss
Wright Company of Long Island City. is a former Army Beach 26, who later
transferred to the AAF. He wife, also is present at the conference,
office, near to the scene related to the Time Food store office, long 
island City. is a high school graduate with 3 years of Pratt Institute (Art &
occasions.)

According to the they were sitting on the rear porch of their
home at approximately 1650 hours on the 6th of August. In answer to the casual
upward and saw what he described as a round object, 'Small' in color, which flew
similar to the motion "seen in "a spinning dollar when tossed." It was silent,
travelling from southwest to north from a 1 o'clock to an eleven o'clock to a five o'clock
wife's attention to the object at once, and both of them claim that they had
the object in view for approximately 5 minutes.

According to the the object commanded 10 miles or more in the said
an irregular edge and appeared to be obtaining in no smoke or distinctive
object finally disappeared into the haze.

A visit was made to the LaGuardia Weather Station, observer, 
Irwin Drumh (A Reserve Lieutenant assigned to the Controller's Unit at
Mitchell) provided the information that at 1650 and 1725 EST visibility
varied between 12 and 15 miles, and two wind readings which varied
with a 5 mile varying between 5 and 11 miles per hour.

A balloon was released at 0550 EST from LaGuardia which provided the info,
and, therefore, after the time of the reported unidentified object.

A telephone call to the Operations Officer at Lakehurst provided the
information that two advertising balloons left Lakehurst for Kingston, New York,
at 1000 and 1245 EST. Two "free air ballons were estimated, rising to
1000 to 1500 feet at a speed of 45 to 50 knots.

Attention is called to the fact that reported object traveled in general
direction of the prevailing wind, and high, at time of observation, was, in
relation to object, in such a position as to obvise possibility of reflection
from front of disc.

Tower personnel at LaGuardia reported no unusual occurrences on the date
in question and it would appear that any object of type noted would be seen by
these people.
