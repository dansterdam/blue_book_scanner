Questionnaire Checks Flying Saucer Stories

WASHINGTON, April 28 –(P)– Technical intelligence division experts can’t figure out the flying saucer mystery, but they have a theory that could lead to the answer.

So, they have prepared a questionnaire for anybody in the air forces who thinks he has seen a "saucer."

The questionnaire is hush-hush.

It is part of "Project Saucer," the air forces’ systematic investigation of the reports from all over the United States about the strange missiles. 

Many of the discs that have been reported were high in the sky – some as high as 40,000 feet. The questionnaire is designed to weed out possible cases of misidentification of known types of aircraft or natural phenomena.

The air forces say it has found mental answers to about 60 percent of the 270 cases it has investigated. But it has left a question mark behind the other 40 percent.

Some cases involved real objects because expert pilots have chased them. One national guard pilot died because he pursued some discs too high.

Re: "Project Saucer and Rockets"

Gentlemen;

The Daily News, a local paper and under the date-
line of "Washington, April 28 (AP) - states the following: 
Questionnaire Checks Flying Saucer Stories.

This is to state that I, on several occasions since 
last winter have seen what appears to have been an object or 
rocket hurtling through the sky during the late night and 
early hours of the mornings. The objects were apparently 
traveling at a high rate of speed, and were traveling across 
the sky in nearly a straight line of flight, and the objects 
or object was traveling from "N.E. to "S.W. and the object 
did not have the appearance of a meteor or a star as a meteor -
normally does such is distinguished a states a greenish glow 
rather this was a constant in flight with Blue-green and White 
pattern of exhaust and quite wide. Should you desire to know 
anything further or if I may be of help please advise.
