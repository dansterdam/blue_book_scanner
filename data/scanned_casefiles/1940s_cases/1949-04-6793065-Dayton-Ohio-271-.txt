The image depicts a page from a document with several fields of typed data and a hand-drawn illustration. The illustration in the document appears to be a simple line drawing of a waveform-like shape with two humps, perhaps intended to represent the motion or shape of an object referred to in the report. Below the drawing, the text "Probable Aircraft" is written, presumably as a conclusion or interpretation of the observation.

WHAT THEY SAW: Time about 7:30 (rang in at 7:43) Car driven by ____  ____  ____ . Travelling east at about 35-40 mph. On Valley Pike
approaching Harshville rd. (almost opposite Mad River School. Round
shining object possibly white high over the fields south of the road
and ahead of the car. Appearing as of a white parachute unusually high
and descending. Continued appearing to descend, but not becoming more
clearly defined, as a parachute would. Travelled steadily on a straight
course, with no maneuvering. Crossed the road ahead of car in a northeast
direction. Appeared smaller than when first sighted, but still very
bright. Grew smaller in the distance until hidden by trees. Reappeared
once then lost in the distance. Object had to be self propelled to
make such speed, but was round from any angle.

An Unidentified Flying Object
(Pie shaped mercur-like object)
hovered over the road - a short
distance west of Riverdale School
Dome shaped with a very white
surface that put off a soft glow
all of the round-and a red light at each
of the corners of a white
appearance on the under lip - the
round as to resemble the light
and construction. Not at all
continuing of this ring it descended,
but not following the road closely,
it swayed as a falling leaf would,
but travelled steadily on a straight
course, and not swerving
nor up and down as a leaf that
crosses the road. When they saw
direction approx. on the hwy when
they first sighted, but did not
cross road. Flew over the ground or
approached the river which the
road leads to but did not care
to make much of it. Not nervous
or excitable.
