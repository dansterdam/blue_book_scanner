The image provided is a scanned document page labeled as "UNCLASSIFIED". There are no photographs present on this page. It appears to have some markings and possibly a stamp near the bottom, but the text is not clearly readable.

The overall quality of the image is low, with high contrast and some parts of the text being obscured or faded. Since the document's text is not legible due to the quality of the scan, I cannot provide an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output of the content accurately. If you require information from the document, it might be beneficial to provide a clearer image or another page from the report that has more legible text.

(Size and approximate altitude were estimated on assumption that
condensation trail was normal type which could persist at 30,000 feet
during that time of year).

9. and 10. Direction of flight and maneuvers: Horizontal direction
would not be positively determined. Movement in vertical plan was
both up and down with tight maneuvering.

11. Evidence of exhaust:

a. Color of smoke: Apparent condensation trail was intensely
white more so than cirrus cloud formations.
b. Length of trail: Estimated 10 to 15 times length of ob-
ject and width would fill width of object to 10 times that size.
c. Odor: None
d. Rate of evaporation: Complete or near of described trail.
e. Wingtip vortices: None

12. Effect on clouds: Object did not pass through any cloud
formations but at times appeared silhouetted against cirrus clouds -
therefore indicating object was below cirrus formations.

13. Flight: None

14. Support: None observed

15. Propulsion: None observed

16. Control and stability:

a. No fins observed
b. No stabilizers observed

17. No air ducts observed.

18. Speed: Not over 200 miles per hour.

19. Sound: None

20. Manner of disappearance: Lost sight of object on entering city
of Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

Relative to the Observer

1. Name of observer: Major [REDACTED]
