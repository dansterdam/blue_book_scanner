UNCLASSIFIED 9 December 1948

I, [REDACTED] Sergeant, USAF, [REDACTED] Weather Observer,
16th Weather Squadron, Chanute Air Force Base, Chanute Field, Illinois
do hereby make the following statement to Captain Rush T. Kelley,
Assistant Base Weather Officer.

On 8 December 1948 at approximately 1816 hours, I was walking
towards the Base Weather Station when I
happened to look up at the sky and notice what appeared to be either
a sky rocket or meteor. It tapped Sgt. [REDACTED] on the arm and called
his attention to it.

The object did not appear to be a star because it was three or
four times as large as a star and it seemed to be closer to us than
a star would be. It was heading from the north east toward the
south south west and was moving upwards at about 15 or 20 degree angle.
As it moved it seemed to get larger, and it was leaving a trail. In
about two or three seconds it disappeared. The object was round, white
and moved very fast.

We went into the Weather Station and reported this to the Duty
Forecaster whose name is M Sgt. Robert W. Fillman.

Incident: 216

On 8 Dec 1948 at approximately 1845 hours Sergeant [REDACTED]
noticed what appeared to be either a sky rocket or meteor, and
called the object to the attention of his companion, Sergeant
[REDACTED]

Sergeant [REDACTED] stated that the object did not appear to be a star
since it was below the star limit and it was heading from the northeast to
closer than a star would be. It was entering a star and seemed
the south southwest and was moving upwards at about a 10 or 20 degree
angle. As it moved it seemed to get larger. The object left a trail.
In about two or three seconds it disappeared. The object was round,
white and moved very fast.

Sergeant [REDACTED] statement does not differ as to direction or color
or angle of ascent. States that the object never got about 2 to 3/10's
