DETAILS

1. This investigation was requested by letter from District Office 
#5, Wright Patterson AFB, dated 17 December 1948, predicated upon a post 
card received at their office.  Information on post card is extracted below:

"Dear Sirs; I was awake last night about 5:00 A.M. - sitting by my window
gazing up at the stars when suddenly there came into view, flying east to 
west over the Charles River Basin, three fast-flying single-engine planes.
The planes had no lights - but city lights made them visible like three pale 
moths.  The two outside ones going in a straight line, the middle one veer-
ing back and forth - although at so great height.  There was no sound."

                                              Yours very truly

7. Reliability of observer:

Unknown. No records Police Department or FBI, no former
employer available. Mrs. [redacted] is not well known in the
vicinity under the landlady (owner) of [redacted]
wherever, and associates and would give no information. Upon

10 Comments of interrogator re intelligence and character
    of person interrogated:

Believe Mr. [redacted] to be of average intelligence and
character, but on the other hand believe him to be a type
of person who could very easily be mistaken in an obser-
vation such as this. As it was not possible to determine
the date of sighting, it is not known whether any aircraft
of the type supposedly observed were airborne in the vicin-
ity of Boston, Massachusetts.

Incident #210 -- Boston, Massachusetts -- 19 November 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.
The objects seen were apparently conventional aircraft.
It is rather surprising, since, in the day light, the observer could
identify them as single-engine planes, and yet could hear no sound
from them.

2. The incidents' summaries 173 through 233 have been checked

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation Of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 15, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Sighting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

which might have accounted for this sighting.

Dear Sirs: I was awake last night about 5:00 A. M. - sitting by the

flying east to west over the Charles River Basin, three fast-flying

made them visible like three pale moths. The two outside ones going
in a straight line, the middle one weaving back and forth - although
at no great height. There was no sound."
