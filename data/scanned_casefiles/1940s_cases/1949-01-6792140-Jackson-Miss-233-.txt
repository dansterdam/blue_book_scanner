This investigation conducted at the request of the Commanding Officer,
Jackson Air Force Base, Mississippi, upon receipt of a TWX from the Commanding 
General, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, requesetirr that a detailed report 
be obtained regarding the unidentified aerial phenomena sighted by Mr. ******* 
********, Avenue, Jackson, Mississippi.

AT JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI:

On 6 January 1949, Mr. ****** *******, was interviewed and 
stated that at approximately 1700 hours, on the date of 1 January 1949, while he 
and his wife and a Mr. and Mrs. ******** were driving from Gulfport to North 
Jackson Air Park in a Stinson Aircraft, at a speed of approximately one hundred 
twenty-five miles per hour, at an altitude of seventeen hundred feet, travelling 
310° or NW-by-west, two miles East of Jackson, Mississippi, one-half mile North of 
Highway 80, almost to the Pearl River Oxbow, he and Mr. ******* of Knox Glass Bottle Company 
From a position of 1:00 o’clock--two-thirds to between 1:00 and 2:00, was only one 
object, 90° location several (saucer-like) sea craft, 7,000 ft.; from 2:30 o’clock 
location, this object was quite a distance away, this object directly in front of his 
and when first seen, this nhist was about l00° below the horizon and gradually 
climbing across the horizon as the object went around, at an altitude of approxi­-
mately sixteen hundred feet, to seventeen hundred feet, they were standing. He 
stated that he and other occupants flew within 500 yards approximately, to 
observers, described this object as being silver dark blue or black. The observer 
the attached diagram rather than describe either the shiny or white. To the shade of 
a dove-down through a trap, not rising as it had gone down in 15 minutes more or less by 
the object, sea look, but it is flat. Investigator interprets this object as being sixty feet to 
400 yards long, 10 x width to length, sea dart: this object as going under the coast 
seventy feet long, eight, flat to ten feet in diameter, than the front end tapering to 
two feet, to three feet at the rear. Observer described the object as resembling 
a large sleeve target, the front opening much larger than the opening of a sixty 
foot sleeve target. He described the object's direction of flight as being west 
toward Jackson, Mississippi, at a 500 to 600 turn toward the Southwest
scribed the object's maneuvers as being horizontal, then turning, gradual ascent, 
90 degree U turn gradually, seemingly lazy slow fluttering as it departed. 
to evidence of exhaust, effect on clouds, lights, support, propulsion, there was 
no evidence of any kind. E- stated that when first sighted, this object was 
traveling at what he considered approximately two hundred miles per hour, but as 
it turned and departed, its speed seemed faster than Jet Nbs, making four hundred 
to five hundred miles per hour. As to sound, E- did not notice any particular 
sound; however, Mr.- and the pilot's wife claim to have heard a seemingly 
roaring sound as the ohsect left the vicinity, E- rights off a type and said that, this 
object is just a jet from Texas.

UNCLASSIFIED                       Incident: 233

Mr. [redacted] a pilot with Dixie Air Service, Jackson, Mississippi,
and his wife (private pilot), sighted an unidentified aerial object
2 miles east of Jackson, Mississippi, at 1700, 1 Jan 49 while coming
in for a landing at the Dixie Airport. Object was first described as
being cigar-shaped with short stubby wings resembling a rocket.
(Second report states there were no wings) Mr[redacted] believes 
in a signed letter "as the object made its turn, it was then that I noticed
the object didn't have wings." Object was first thought to be a large
tow target about 60 feet long and about 10 feet in diameter at one end
and about 1 ft at the trailing end. The tail even fluttered like a target
but there was no towing cord and the object moved at greater speed than
tow targets. When the object crossed in front of the plane estimated
at ≈ 500 ft above 200 MPH and on two's to 300 ft to the rear ≈ 500 feet
feet in front of them. After the turn, the object wised in plane 500
of the plane. Mr[redacted] attempted to point out the object to the pilot but
but the pilot did not understand and apparently did not see the object.
As the object turned to the southwest it accelerated its speed and flew
out of sight. Object seen for some 10 to 12 seconds, Color was dark
blue or black. Speed at first sighting - 200 miles per hour, later
thought to have accelerated to between 400 to 600 mph.

Object was sighted by the above person's who were passengers in a Stinston
civilian aircraft. No photographs were taken since a camera was not availa-
ble. The Stinson was flying and about 3,300 feet. Investigators of flight
schedules of adjacent airfields could throw no light on the incident.

Jackson, Mississippi
January 6, 1949

Commanding General AMC

Attention: MCIAAX O-3

Gentlemen:

This letter is in reply to a request from the Base Commander, Jackson Army Air Base, Jackson, Miss., on a strange object sighted by my wife on 1 January 1949.

Mrs. and Mrs. [redacted] my wife, and I were flying from [redacted] to North Jackson Airpark and were approaching the airport and our altitude was about 1,000 feet when I saw something go in front of us. I assumed that it was another plane since it was headed toward the municipal airport in Jackson and was on the eastern leg of the airways.

I watched the object to try to recognize the type of plane. After it passed, it made a turn of about 50 degrees and headed southwest. The time was 17:00 as we had just made a comment on the time and I had checked our ground speed. As the object made its turn, it was then that I noticed the object didn't have wings. At that time, my wife saw the object and became excited. She is a private pilot and is familiar with plane identification from the air.

The sun had not set and the weather was clear to the southwest as the object went away from us. When it crossed in front of us, I estimated its speed to be about 200 mph and about 500 feet in front of us. After the turn, it was as close as 1,200 feet from us. We tried to point out the object to the pilot, but he thought we were trying to show him something else.

As the object turned and went to the southwest, with a sudden burst of speed, it was out of sight. In all, I saw the object 10 or 12 seconds.

At first, I thought the object was a large tow 
target about 60 feet long and about 10 feet in diameter 
at one end and about 4 feet at the trailing end. The 
tail end was illuminated by a light that was nothing 
twinkling and it seemed to have a greater speed than tow 
targets I've seen before.

When we landed about five minutes later, we called 
the CAA Control Tower to see if this thing had landed 
at the Municipal Airport and were informed that nothing 
had landed there recently. The Control Tower then
notified the Air Corps.

Although I was not flying at the time, I have 
approximately 1,000 hours of military and civilian pilot 
time and know my aircraft identification pretty good---
except in this case.

Attached to this letter is a drawing of this 
object and a rough sketch of where the object was sighted. 
If I can be of further assistance to you, I will be glad 
to help.

Very truly yours
