The text is heavily degraded and some parts are difficult to discern, but I have reconstructed it as accurately as possible given the available quality.

The image provided appears to be a highly faded or degraded document, and it contains no photograph. The text is mostly illegible due to the quality of the image, but I will attempt to reproduce any legible portions. 

---
The text is too faint and blurry to be distinctly read, which prevents providing a verbatim transcription. The only clearly visible text at the bottom of the page is "UNCLASSIFIED."

Unfortunately, I cannot provide more detailed text because the content is not readable within the provided image.

Incident #23 – Boise, Idaho – 30 June 1947

It seems exceedingly probable that the object observed
in this incident was a sunlit lenticularis cloud effect. The altitude
of the sun was 36°, azimuth 230°. At that time of the afternoon,
the sun's position was such that it could easily have illuminated
a background cloud which was perhaps almost entirely covered by a
foreground cloud. (Local weather reports indicate an entirely
clear sky, with the report of the incident itself states that the
object "seemed to be clinging to a high cloud.") This investigator
himself has observed such effects.

HEADQUARTERS
AIR MATERIAL COMMAND
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
Dayton, Ohio

MXC1AO-X
Jan 5 1949

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
     Andrew Air Force Base,
     Washington 25, D. C.
     ATTN: DSS

     1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investi-
gation and interpretation of date relative to sightings of unidentified
flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the files
of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendation as to
which of the incidents may be eliminated e. g. balloons released on routing
cryptographic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological
Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached
may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

     2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that
has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except
that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball
lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are
conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are
scheduled by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks
usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, MXC1AO-X. These
checks are distinct from the checks of cryptonic balloon flights made by
weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department
of Commerce. (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

     3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed inci-
dents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This
list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining
incidents are balloons.
