The image shows what appears to be a large, circular object with a somewhat textured or patterned surface. There are concentric circles on the object, possibly indicating contour lines or surface variations, and the top half has a different texture than the bottom half, which is smoother. There is a light source creating a glare on the object's left side, which causes a bright spot and radiating light patterns. The background is dark, and the object stands out in high contrast.

Regarding the text, there is little to be found on this page, and only two words that are clear:

"UNCLASSIFIED"

Unfortunately, due to the quality and composition of the image, no additional textual information can be provided.

IN REPLY REFER TO:

SUBJECT: Flying Disc Found in Shreveport, Louisiana
7 July 1947

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

This office received a report at 2100, 7 July 1947, that a flying
disc had been located in the outskirts of Shreveport, Louisiana, and immediately initiated an investigation which revealed the following information:

1. Mr. [Redacted], Shreve-
port, Louisiana, stated in an interview on 7 July 1947, that
at 1805, 7 July 1947, he had heard the disc whirling through
the air and had looked up in time to see it when it was approxi-
mately two hundred feet in the air and coming over a sign board
adjacent to the used car lot where he was standing. [Redacted]
stated that smoke and fire were coming from the disc and that
it was traveling at a high rate of speed and that it fell into
the street in his immediate vicinity. [Redacted] further stated
that he had retrieved the disc from the street and immediately
notified Army Officials at Barksdale Field. (C-4)

2. Examination of the disc disclosed that it had been
made from a round piece of either Alclad or Fibraloid, Specific-
ation A1clad-13 clad aluminum, or inlays of thermoset. In the
center of the disc was an ordinary interfire. 3 Kason Mousetrap
light which was fastened on 064 inches by a Parker-Kalon self-
tapping screw. Located on each side at approximately one inch
from the edge of the disc was a condenser of an unknown type
which was held in place by an aluminum strap which was
fastened to the disc by two brazied hard aluminum rivets,
Specification AN-456-DB. Two strands of coiled copper wires
connected the condensers to the starter in the center of the
disc. The condensers and the portion of the disc adjacent to
the top of the condensers appeared to be covered with soot. (A-1)

3. On 8 July 1947, [Redacted], manufacturers of plastic fans,
whose business address is [Redacted], Shreveport, Louisiana,
stated in an interview that he had made the disc in order to play
a joke on his boss and that the starter had been taken from a

further stated that he had used an acetylene torch to
put soot on the edges of the disc to create the impression
that the disc had been whirling at a high rate of speed.
stated that he had climbed to the top of the building at
and had that he had sailed the disc in front of his
boss's car, but that his boss had failed to notice (the disc
did grow away. further stated that some man (presumably
saw the disc fall into the street and picked it up.
further stated that he did not retrieve the disc or tell
the man who picked it up what it was, as he was of the opinion
that anyone who examined the disc would readily tell that it
was not from "outer, as the (it) was the work of a (Practical)
Joker. stated that it definitely was not intended to
cause the excitement that it had caused. (N-2)

Investigation was discontinued immediately upon uncovering enough
evidence to reasonably assure this office that the disc incident was only
a practical joke and no further investigation is contemplated.

This Case Includes

The image appears to be a black and white photocopy of a photograph or some sort of graphical representation. It depicts a circular shape with some irregular, wave-like edges and varying regions of light and dark. The texture within the darker areas of the circle seems rough or fuzzy, while the lighter areas look smoother. There are three small, circular marks toward the right margin of the image that may be holes or marks on the original document before it was copied. There are also some faint lines and artifacts that could be a result of the copying process or degradation of the material over time.

Unfortunately, due to the quality and nature of the image, the text is not visible or discernible to transcribe any information it might contain.

- page 9 -

The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a circular object with a textured surface. There are swirling patterns on the surface and multiple circular impressions or anomalies that could be either on the object itself or an effect from the photograph's development process. The photo is bordered by what seems to be a matte frame and shows signs of wear or damage, as well as three punch holes on the left side, suggesting it was archived in a binder or folder.

I'm sorry, but no text is visible in the image provided. If there is supposed to be accompanying text outside the photograph, it is not included in the image.

- page 10 -

The image you've provided appears to be a black and white photograph of a circular object or phenomenon with a pattern of indentations or markings covering its surface. It seems to be an aerial view or a close-up of a pattern, and there is no clear scale or reference to accurately determine its size or the nature of what's depicted.

No text is visible within the provided image, thus there is no text for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output. If there is textual information on another part of this document or page, you would need to provide that section for text extraction.
