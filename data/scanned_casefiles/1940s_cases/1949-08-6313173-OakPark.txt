TO : MCIAXA-1, Mr. Rodgers

FROM : MCIAXA

DATE: 27 March 1950

SUBJECT: Incident - Unidentified Object

1. The following information is given as another report of an incident which occurred between 8 P. M. and 11 P. M. in August or September 1949.

2. Mr. [redacted], Building [redacted], I, reported that an unidentified object appeared over his house at Oak Park on Watervelat Avenue and appeared every 11 minutes and that he timed five of these intervals. The object appeared to be 100 north of the elliptic circle flying north, northwest. Five flashes occurred during the time of passing over the house. The color of the object was blueish white, somewhat of the appearance of "lightning bug". The object appeared to be quite high.

3. This report should be filed with other such reports being held in the Performance & Characteristics Branch for future reference.

The Two Tonopah Rectangles

A remarkable phenomenon observed in New Mexico in the summer of 1949 has remained among the most puzzling of the Un-Knows. As in the Chesapeake Bay case, the facts are not in dispute. The witness was an astronomer, Clyde Tombaugh, at that time in charge of the optical instrumentation of the rocket-flight program at the White Sands Missile Range. He had thousands of hours of experience in observing the night sky and was still astonished, he had gained fame after months of patient searching off a photograph/plates, by locating the image of the planet Pluto near the position long predicted for it by Lowell and Pickering.
On the night of August 20 Tombaugh was sitting with his wife and his mother-in-law in the yard of his home in Las Cruces, watching the stars. There was no moon, and the transparency of the sky was extraordinary, so that even the stars of 6th magnitude, usually barely detectable by the naked eye, were clearly visible. About 10:45 P.M. a geometrically spaced group of six to eight rectangules of light appeared almost directly overhead. Of luminousity. They were "windowlike" in appearance and yellowish-green in color. The individual rectangles were quite small, each lower than four or five degrees of arc, and the entire group covered a span of about 15 minutes (about twice that of the full moon). As they moved reverently in a vertical circle path toward the southeast, the individual rectangles became foreshortened, the span of the group became smaller, the lights aventulaly faded and faded in view some 3 to 40 degrees above the horizon. The full viewing was for about three seconds. Mrs. Tombaugh, who did not have the luxury only they had moved some distance from their chairs. The rectangles until about about 1½ seconds after Tombaugh realized and told her seemed a diffuse greenish glow, intervening a span of through spots of light. For every that that always has been active than that for the husband, line in vistman that the difference in their descriptions is thus different and articulated.
Although Tonopah had been wanted to travel with the smaller rectangles or to note some other features of the craft abound later, he immediately recorded the facts of his experience. He sketched the pattern of the formation, and noted his impression that the lights had been part of a rigid structure. He added, "I have these thousands of hours of night sky watching, was never saw a night rare strange as this." A report of this statement that forwarded to Air Force officials, who could find no explanation. UFO enthusiasts subsequently announced the phenomenon a true flying saucer—an interpretation that the witness himself never made.
The account given to the plausible untruthful snifter from various distortions of fact. Int in Casanave-like warning of possible visitors from other planets, Life Magazine referenced the Tonopah sighting as one of the key cases and in an ten-side the documentation mandad to include at least six misstatements, some of which added to the "uncanny" nature of the incident. According to this summary (1) the year was 1949 (it was 1949); He the time was about 11:00 P.M. (it was 10:45 P.M.); the lights were traveling south to north (they were moving northwest to southeast); the object had an oval shape (Tombaugh did not specify a shape); the lights exhibited a glare (they were of lower luminosity); their speed was too fast for a plane, too slow for a meteor (no estimate of speed was given). On a nationwide TV show broadcast in 1955 the director of NICAP stated specifically that Tombaugh had observed a cigar-shaped object with lighted portholes [1a]. An "artist's conception" of the UFO in one publication [3b] depicts a long, tapered ship with a line of lighted windows, wholly unrelated to Tombaugh's own sketch, which shows no unifying structure, merely small rectangles arranged as though each one were at the corner of a hexagon (see Figure 4S).

The image contains what appears to be a drawing or a diagram rather than a photograph. The diagram, labeled "Figure 89", consists of four segments labeled A through D. It illustrates the concept of Searchlight shines on clouds, highlighting different situations with varying atmospheric conditions. Segment A shows a single spotlight ray through slightly foggy or dusty atmosphere, touching on cloud layers and foggy or dusty atmosphere. Segment B shows a clean level through clear atmosphere with no light value. Segment C depicts multiple thin cloud layers, and Segment D illustrates a single ray through no light atmosphere. Below the diagram is the title "FINAL GALLEY PROOF" and the chapter heading "Galley 99—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS".

Here is the text from the document:

(a), through slightly foggy or dusty atmosphere, light continually visible as it travels through multiple thin cloud layers and foggy or dusty atmosphere; (c) is  seen level through clear atmosphere with no light value; (d) is multiple thin cloud layers, no light come visible.

While keeping an open mind on the possibility of interplanetary travel, Townhaupt himself has never supported the spaceship interpretation so often attributed to him in print but has instead several variations possible explanations-situations or air gestures denoted by irregular lights, or reflections of ground lights against the boundary of an inversion layer in the air. Of these, the inversion theory seems the most probable. The layer in which it would have been the most thin or eroded may wake, or see a true cut and thus lend themselves to the faint scars he was observing. As in the Clearbrook-Kay case, the mysterious retracts driver's undistortedly the special effect of some unique combination of circumstances, unlikely to be repeated. Conditions were ideal for the formation of small humps localized inversions the weather was clear, the thin dust layer threw a small temperature inversion existing at a relatively low elevation and smoke, haze, or dust collecting in a very thin layer at relative low altitude were the prerequisites that almost certainly must assume unknown corrive-the vicinity of the in the thin haze layer. possibilities-could have produced a ripple in the effect the wind. This ripple, tipping the haze layer at a slight angle, could have reflected the lighted windows of a house, as the ripple traveled in a weak multiple thin layer, the reflection could have moved as did the rectangles of light. Conditions of refraction at the interface would have reflected the waves upward.

Townhaupt has recently summarized his convictions on the entire UFO phenomena as well as on his own sighting:

"From my own studies of the clear system I cannot entertain any serious possibility for intelligent life on the other planets, not even for Mars (the planet to which I have devoted considerable observation and study over the past thirty-five years). The logistics of visitations from planets revolving around the millions stars is staggering. In consideration of the hundreds of year of stars in the geologic time scale when such visitations may possibly have occurred, the odds of a single visit in a given century or millennium are overwhelmingly against such an event.

"A much more likely source of explanation is some natural optical phenomenon in our own atmosphere. In my 1949 sighting the intensity of the object, together with the manner of fading in horizon. as it traveled away from zenith towards the southeastern faintness is quite suggestive of a reflection from an optical boundary or surface of slight contrast in reflective index, as in an inversion layer. I have spent a lot of time when anything like it before or since, and I set "I have never seen anything like it beyond seen well. This suggests that the phenomenon involves a complexity and rare set of conditions or circumstances to produce it, but nothing like the

Jan. 11, 1950

Dear Sir,

    With regard to your letter of September 19, 1949, I should
like to give an account of two strange occurrences.

    The first occurred in 1944, and you probably have
information on it already. It was in the spring or early
summer. I was in the army at Camp Breckinridge, Ky; when
at least fifty of us soldiers observed in the sky overhead,
a dirigible shaped flying north at high speed (about 900 m.p.h)
It was noon. The Chicago Tribune carried some articles that
week about reports of the craft. It seemed to have come from
the direction of Tennessee, thru Kentucky, Illinois and was
last seen heading out over Lake Michigan.

    The other was this summer Sept. 1., 10 p.m. on U.S. 16
10 miles west of L______ Lake, In in the sky to the South. I
and I sighted momentarily in the sky a sudden flash of light
and a red and green cone of flames shooting across the sky.
There are no airports, searchlights, etc, and there were no planes
in the vicinity. The trail of flame seemed to be from 2½ to
4½ sec. and originated near the moon which was high in the
sky at this time.

    I have heard many reports of objects and green curtains
of flame as seen by many of my friends, who were very serious
and reliable in their reports.

    Two weeks ago the report came over the radio that
a craft of the type I mention in my first paragraph had been
seen flying across Alaska at speeds faster than credited to
any of our planes. This news never got any further.

    I am glad to be of service whenever possible in the
investigation of these phenomena which have intrigued me.

                                    Sincerely yours, 

                                    [signature]
