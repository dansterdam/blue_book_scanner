Incident _____317______

Page 2
Name and address of observer: _______________, Des Moines, Iowa

Occupation and hobbies: None

Comments of interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

Observer is a egotariac and a constant source of trouble in neighborhood and capable of
dreaming up things which don't exist.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY: - - - - Mr. _________ ___________, Des Moines, Iowa, retired,
was interviewed on 20 May 1949. Mr. _______ stated that he was awakened from a sound
sleep by a terrifying light shining through his blinds on 7 April 1949 at 0115 hours.
He estimated that he watched the light from his bed and that it was approximately brighter
than a day, ______ stated that he could see shadows in his back yard, one a light one
from the garage next door, but that it gave or cast no shadow from the telephone pole
to the rear of his house. He (name) then got up and went to the window on the west
and watched the light until it disappeared behind the neighbor's house and chimney.
_______ stated that he awakened no one in the house because they have two roomers who have to
go to work early, and also a young grandchild who, if awakened, will not go to sleep
again. ______ stated that when he was a young boy fourteen years old he looked directly
into the sun spot, and this is the phenomena in the sky is the closest thing he has seen
to the sun spot. He further stated that looking into that sun spot has left a lasting
impression on him but that he had not thought about it until this happened the other
night. He also called the local paper and told them about it and that he didn't mind a
little publicity if they would report the truth as he saw it and not make it appear
that he (name) had been "flying saucer" happy. He stated this address to
about aerial phenomena and that the last article he read he had given his address
which correspondence concerning unusual activity should be sent. ______ reported
the incident to, the newspaper before he communicated with Wright Field. _______ stated
that no one from the newspaper had come to see him. The object was moving north and
______ stated he had to get on his knees to see out his window and over the roof of
the house next door on the West. ______ stated that the shadow on his bedroom floor
was moving south and that the light was so intense that it shown through his blinds
which are heavy, green, non-transparent blinds.

AGENT'S NOTE: When writer asked to be making statements which he was not sure were
consistent, then the writer remarked about this, the contact would counter by making his
statements they were not correct, (name) grandchild was present and this appeared to
upset the interview very much – comfortable chair – child was asking questions
and ______ appeared desirous of having the child out of the room.

Gentlemen:

About 4:15 a.m. Thursday, April 7th, I was awakened by the brightest light I have ever seen.

It was not a ball or fire racing through the sky. It was moving so slow it appeared to be standing still. The only way that I could tell it was moving was to note the space between it and the roof of my neighbor's house, 251 west of me. It passed west of that roof, going north.

The was a straight line on the back of the thing. It was divided into two compartments. The upper apartment was three times as large as the lower apartment. They were separated by a straight line. The lower apartment was divided into seven different apartments, all the same size, all a different color, and all had straight sides. The whole thing was inclosed in something like glass. I did not see any opening nor did I hear any noise.

The upper apartment was a raging fire. The fire seemed to start at the point where I started the arrow, race up to the ceiling, then turn around and around. When the fire hit the ceiling it always turned towá the back and then down.

The moment I saw it I was satisfied it was man made. It was the most heinous looking thing I had ever seen. I don't think it was mo-e than 200 feet from me. Please find enclosed a rough sketch of the thing. This thing did not reassemble [resemble] the "saucers." (I saw three saucers last October, about 2:30 P.M. The day was perfect. They were not on the sun visage east of overhead, the sun going south west. The sun was shining on them. They were very north, not very fast.

At first glance they seemed to be bobing along, but I noticed they seemed to have rhythm. Then I could see that they were fastened together, by a stout colored iris, about two "aga petals. The iris was travelling at a vary, vary speed. This speed, plus angulation & axis, at a terrific linear angle had a rotating, polition or arc, brought on the axis, seemed to hold it up and move it forward. I saw exam to boys through saucers just like an auger. I saw no tail, no wings no light.

The thing that I saw, April 7. moved straight, steady and trop. ov. -- as had as a kite but -- sorab- thing like iron. ................. had vary ...............

This image appears to be a scanned page with a handwritten drawing. The drawing looks somewhat like a cylindrical or canister-shaped object with two layers or levels, and there's some sort of pattern or markings on the upper level. There are handwritten annotations around the drawing. Unfortunately, there's no photograph in this image.

The text on the document is a little bit unclear due to the handwriting and quality of the scan, but here's my best transcription of the text around the drawing:

```
DESCRIPTION OF A "FIREBALL"
by Dr. William Northdurft.

In the early morning of April 7, 1949, at about 4:15 - 4:30 a.m., there appeared over Des Moines, Iowa, a strange object. This was two days after the various appearances over Salt Lake City and northward. 

The object was evidently first seen by a Mr. Eggert. One of the shades in his room (toward the west) was up about four inches; the light that came through this small opening was so bright that it awakened him, and he went to the window, spent several moments examining the object, then lay down on his bed again to determine by its shadow where it was moving. The shadow (or, the light on the floor) was moving southward. Then he went to the window again and watched it as it slowly disappeared behind the house next door. The object was thus travelling north and was west of the observer. "It was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life" says Mr. Ahern; and he drew a sketch of the way it looked:

                    [HAND-DRAWN DIAGRAM]
                      (like IRON 
                       or ALUMINUM)

LEFT: SLUG of BLACK              Transparent Mr. diagram
THROW                          

Use of              The lower part was also lighted
      (has mass    as if in compartments, and these
       and volume) were a FLAMable colour black, yellow,
                    bright purple and purple respectively.

                            RIGHT:
Left vertical line represents a part that looked thick, like a mental. The upper part seemed transparent and full of fire. The lower part was also lighted as if in compartments, and these were a flamable colour black, yellow, bright purple and purple respectively.

At about the same time, a Mrs was startled by, a brilliant light, some 40 blocks west of Mr. Mr was startled by a brilliant light, high in the sky toward the S.W. Fire trailed from it like a Roman candle" but the illumination was very brief. Both Mrs and Mr seemed to me to be perfectly normal people and not unduly excited by their experiences.

From my interviews with people in Waterloo last fall regarding the discs that were seen here in July 1947, and from newspaper clipping, especially from Iowa, I have learned that similar phenomena are usually seen over a certain kind of terrain, either around a hilly section, or river bottoms where great oak isolas are, and always with little vegetation and undergrowth. In Waterloo, this section of Des Moines, and in Ezline, Iowa, (where a disc was seen May 5th last), there are rivers. In the light of this, I am wondering if this object seen over DesMoines was not going slowly over this hilly section, looking for something, and whether the float raid by Mrs. Dubany night might have been a ship; one like them that appeared not only as a "fire ball" over "dark terrain", but as "grey saucers" as well. During daylight, over DesMoines and Ezline, La. over Utah, and over Oakland, Calif.---all were travelling northward.

Zelienople, Pa.
13 July 1949

Project Saucer,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton,
Ohio

Gentleman;-

I hope, sincerely, you do not think I am boring you with my occasional and small contributions.

I jest very badly about Shallett mentioning my little theory regarding the "saucers". He certainly had not asked my permission, and I really believe it gave the reader the impression that one takes his life, and reputation in his hands to dare write you in confidence. Is it so bad the chap he usually puts in ridicule by "quotin" is, Shallett is the Sat--- who covers up "little green men" who, he is to believe is observing is do quite small, as to be looking in on him and joking attitude that Foster's writer Shallett inaugurated in the "Fiasco scientist" who you can leave the flying Saucers. Paxton made my "observation" into "startleling" and made it appear that I had forgotten to be gone over with "them"... Stylishly, a stickler for accuracy, I had checked and rechecked my letter before I submitted it to the Post.

As things now stand, I am a martyr to my convictions, and only time will indicate we. Eilson you my I, as timely hold today, as I did when I first wrote you in "19" '47, that the "saucers" are extra-terrestrial "ghost-objects", propelled by a telekinetic energy and caused to remain stationary in mid-air by vibration, - hence the title of this magazine has the assurers; but FATE, 133 n. Clark Street, Chicago 1, Illinois, will print my article "The Mystery of Sor Releyo's" Last, "terrestrially or plutial to appear in the October 1949 issue, I have, in that article, sum- d up Mr. Harry Price's findings relative to the Paranormal, phenife- manifested in the Borley Rectory hauntings, and you will see my belief SOcialists in the therein.

You may use the enclosed material.

Sincerely,
[Signature Redacted]

AT DES MOINES, IOWA

1. Mrs. LOIS M. WALTON, 2910 Rutland, Das Moines, Iowa, house-
wife and private nurse, was interviewed on 20 June 1949. Mrs. WALTON
stated that she has known Mr. W. L. AHERN for three years as a neighbor,
and that from her observation of him, he (AHERN) appears and acts odd.
Mrs. WALTON also stated that Mr. AHERN has caused trouble in the neighbor-
hood and that she would not put it past AHERN to think up something un-
usual for a bit of publicity.

2. Miss OSSIE TAYLOR, 2926 Rutland, Das Moines, Iowa, saleslady,
was interviewed on 20 June 1949. Miss TAYLOR stated that she has known
Mr. AHERN for nine years as a neighbor and has found him to be odd and
eccentric. Informant also stated that she stays away from AHERN because
he has caused trouble in the neighborhood. Informant stated that AHERN
has a feeling that some of his property may be taken away from him, as
some of the neighbors had their lots surveyed and in the surveying it was
determined that the lot stakes were not exactly right. The neighbors were
entitled to a few more feet of land. This caused AHERN a great deal of
concern as he felt that this would revert down the line until he would
be the last and that some of his land would be taken away from him. AHERN
is hot headed and is capable of giving information that does not exist.

3. Miss MELISSA TAYLOR, 2906 Rutland, Das Moines, Iowa, accountant,
was interviewed on 20 June 1949. Miss TAYLOR stated that she has known
Mr. AHERN for eight years as a member of the community, and believes that
he is capable of giving information which is not substantiated by facts.
AHERN has written letters to the local newspaper, which has caused his fa-
mily great concern because it jeopardized his son's position. AHERN is
eccentric and informant stated that she and her sister have stopped having
anything to do with him.

4. Mr. ***********, Des Moines, Iowa, retired, was
interviewed on 20 June 1949. Mr. ******* stated that he was awakened from
a sound sleep by a terrifying light shining through his blinds on 7 April
1949 at 0415 hours. ******** stated that he watched the light from his bed
and that it gave off a light brighter than day. ******* stated that he
could see shadows in his back yard, especially the eave from the garage
next door, but that it gave or cast no shadow from the telephone pole
to the rear of his house. ******** then went to the window
on the west and watched the light until it disappeared behind the neighbor's
house and chimney. ******** stated that he awakened no one in the house be-
cause they have two roomers who have to go to work early, and also a young
grandchild who, if awakened, will not go to sleep again. ******** stated
that when he was a young boy fourteen years old he looked directly into
a stun gun, and that this phenomena is the only thing in his experience he
has seen to the stun spot. ******** stated that looking into that gun spot

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer (Check neighbors, police dept., FBI records, employer, etc):
This writer believes this to be a publicity stunt which didn't materialize. Subject is fairly intelligent but lacks ambition for doing anything constructive. He is approximately 65 years of age and has no outside interests or within the home. He has read numerous articles on aerial phenomena and is more or less intrigued by them. He has much time to do about nothing. He is stablishly dressed and generally unkempt. His reasoning has been easily changed to conform to this writers opinion, and would readily change his to conform to what was correct.

Did observer wear glasses, especially polaroid glasses at time of sighting, or was object viewed through canopy, window, or other trans- parent material? No glasses were used and object was observed through window pane
