The image appears to be a hand-drawn black and white sketch, not a photograph. It depicts a street view of buildings with roofs and chimneys, with a representation of a UFO in the sky. On the left side of the sketch, there are two circular inserts providing closer views of the UFO from different angles, labeled "SEEN CLOSE" and "SIDE VIEW".

The text on the drawing is as follows:
SEEN CLOSE
ANGL. AS BELOW

SIDE VIEW

At the bottom right corner, there is a small piece of text that seems to be a reference or filing note:
2-4-7J
EMMETT

The image shows a pencil or charcoal sketch, not a photograph. The sketch depicts a nighttime scene with buildings and a street. In the upper left corner, there are two circular insets that represent a close-up view of an object in the sky. 

The top circular inset has an angular geometric shape, labeled "SEEN CLOSE." The bottom circular inset seems to provide a side view, titled "SIDE VIEW," highlighting the object's angle as compared to the horizon, shown with a reference line and angle indicator.

There is no text within the body of the image itself, other than labels for the circular insets. However, in the bottom right corner, there is handwritten text, which appears to be "2-4-7/4 EXHIBIT 'A'".
