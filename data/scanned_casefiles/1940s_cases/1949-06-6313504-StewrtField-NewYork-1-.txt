(6) Number of objects and sketch of formation or groupings:

Object looked to be an oblong sh:pe with a smaller object
attached in front of the l: [unreadable] object. Smaller object
was not noticeable until b: no [unreadable] were used.

(8) Color of object: Through binoculars it appeared to have colors 
of a rainbow (very soft colors) which had a tendency to
fuse mostly with yellow.

(11) Direction from observer;

When first seen it appeared to be northwest from the moon
and approximately two hours later the object had moved half-way
around the moon and appeared to be directly west of the moon.
During this time the observer stated he heard a sound as that
of an airplane and sounded similar to a rifle shot sounded exactly
following the rifle shot sound the object disappeared. There
were no signs of the airplane.

ATTACHMENT: TSDN.

1. In compliance with paragraph la, Continental Air Command Letter,
200-1, dated 25 March 1948, subject: "Report of Flying Discs," an incident
which occurred in this vicinity on 1 June 1949, has been investigated and
the witnesses' reports are inclosed herewith.

2. When this report was originally submitted Mrs. Monte E. Button was
then Miss Leona Pulver. The statements from Miss Simmons and Miss Roe have
been omitted because this office has been unable to contact these witnesses
at this time.

1. A marked similarity exists between the unidentified aerial pheno-
menon described by inclosure to basic letter and the appearance of meteor-
ological or upper air research "balloons and their related equipment in flight.

2. Our information indicates that facilities of Stewart Field are
sometimes utilized by the New York University as a "release site for bal-
loons of this nature.

    which object appeared to be):
    Directly in the center of the city of Walden, New York.
13. Direction of flight of object (s): Did not observe the object more than 
    one or two minutes, therefore, could not determine the direction of flight.

      of target:
   b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (10°), etc.,
      and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not obscr-
