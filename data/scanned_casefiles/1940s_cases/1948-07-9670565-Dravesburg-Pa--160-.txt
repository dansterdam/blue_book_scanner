Incident #150 -- Dravosburg, Pennsylvania -- 4 July 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.

The date of occurrence, July 4, suggests that the object
seen might have been a part of some celebration -- for instance,
a lighted balloon, or even a "county fair" type of balloon.

Or there may be a much simpler explanation for the inci-
dent: the observer was very close to the Allegheny County airport.
Logs the airport have record of other pilot, balloon or small air-
craft in the air at the time of the sighting. Change when the ob-
ject seemed to stop it also changed direction, the stopping may
have been merely the effect of perspective.

This incident does not appear to have any relation to in-
cident #61.

On 4 July 48 at approx. 2115 P. M., CST, witness and his wife thought
they saw a star moving. There was a light in the sky the same color and
size of a star which was moving. They thought it was a plane but
it made no noise. The object moved across the sky, then descended its course
a bit and went straight and stopped again for about 5 seconds, changed its
course a bit and went straight for awhile and stopped again this time for a
last 15 seconds, then it went across the sky a little ways and dispersed
completely. When the object stopped in the sky, it resembled a star and only
by following its course could the difference be noticed.

NOTE: Witness states that he lives some 2-1/2 miles from two woman
(McKeesport, Pa.) who reported seeing a big silver plate zooming
noiselessly overhead in the direction of Kennywood Park. See Inc.
151.

U. S. War Dept.
Washington D. C.

To whom it may concern:

Dear Sirs:

On the fourth of July (July 4, 1948) my wife and I were sitting on a bench on our lawn and we were watching the stars, planes, etc. At 11:15 P. M., O. S. T., we saw something very strange.

We thought we saw a star moving. There was a light in the sky the same color and size of a star and It was moving. We decided it was a plane but it made no noise. We soon changed our minds because this "thing" moved across the sky then changed its course a bit and went straight and stopped again for about 5 seconds, changed its course a bit and went straight for awhile and stopped again this time for at least 15 seconds then it went across the sky a little ways and disappeared completely. When this thing stopped in the sky, if you didn't know where it was at you would not tell it from a star as the resemblance was identical to a star.

After reding in the paper on July 3, 1948 about two women seeing "flying saucers" in the daylight July 3, I believe I saw a "flying saucer" or something in the night July 4, because I know it was no star or an airplane because neither can travel and stop in the air like this "thing" did. I live above 2-1/2 miles from these women who saw the "discs" in the daylight.

Has the War Department any comments on these strange "discs"? They are now reported in the heart of the steal industry.

Yours
