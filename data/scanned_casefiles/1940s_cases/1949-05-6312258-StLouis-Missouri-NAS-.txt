About 2100, 16 May 1949, I was walking in an easterly direction from the

about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon and seemed to have a streak of fire
behind it.  I told LCDR ------, who was walking with me, to look at the object,
he remarked that it was traveling in a horizontal direction rather than falling

About 2100 LCDR [redacted] and I were leaving Ships Service walking
in an easterly direction. As we cleared the buildings so that 
we had an unobstructed view to the south we both noticed a ball
of fire in the sky moving from east to west. The ball of fire
appeared to be from fifteen to thirty degrees above the horizon.
My observation of its movement was through an angular distance
of approximately ninety degrees. There was no increase or decrease
in intensity of light during the time I was in view. It suddenly
disappeared as if moving behind some obstruction.
