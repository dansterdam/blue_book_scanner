The image provided appears to be a poor-quality scanned page, with much of the text being faint and some parts illegible. It does not contain any photographs of UFOs or related imagery. However, I can attempt to transcribe the visible text:

```
Incident # 125
2 May 19[partial visibility, possibly a year in the 1940s]
St. Louis, Mo. 40°00’N 90°15’W

Article: Newspaper Article

TIME: 2100 CDT

No. of objects: 1

Length of observation: after dark (full moon out)

Size of object: _____

No. of witnesses: 1

Type of observer: Ground

Remarks: Bird

(blank space for additional remarks)
```

It appears to be a form or report summarizing a single incident involving a sighting, possibly a reported unidentified flying object. The "Remarks" section suggests that the object in question was identified as a "Bird". Due to the quality of the scan and the cutoff text, not all the information can be discerned accurately.
