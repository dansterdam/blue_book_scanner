Please bear in mind that the handwritten text is difficult to decipher, and some of the interpretations of the words could be incorrect. The document seems to be a description of a mysterious event or sighting, possibly related to the sighting of an unidentified flying object or phenomenon.

- page 2 -

This image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it is a scanned page with cursive handwritten text. The handwriting quality and the scan resolution are fairly low, which makes it difficult to interpret some portions of the text accurately. However, I will do my best to transcribe the visible text:

---

Unfortunately, due to the poor clarity of the handwriting and the scan, several words and phrases are omitted, marked by "+ + +",  as they are not discernible. The original document may offer additional context that would help in understanding the fragmented transcription provided.

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED]

Your letter of April 23rd to Mr. [REDACTED] with its
inclosures, has been referred to this office during his
temporary absence and we wish to thank you very much for
your patriotic interest.

We assure you, Mrs. [REDACTED] that rather than being treated
lightly, your reports of information concerning unusual aerial
phenomena have in every case been studied by those persons con-
cerned with such matters.

We sincerely hope that you will continue to send any further
reports of these sightings, should they occur, to the Air Materiel

From:
Wildwood, N. J.

July 17th/48

This is to inform you that there is activity in Wildwood again and after
several weeks' absence the saucers have been appearing since July 1st, the enclosed 
from a recent "Life" gives almost a perfect reproduction of what we see here.
The color is the same as a gaslight. It would be advisable to watch over Wildwood.

UNCLASSIFIED

Commanding General
Army Air Forces
Washington 25, D. C.

ATTENTION: AC/AS-2
Lt. Col. George Garrett

1. The specimens of the alleged "Flying Saucers" brought to this Command
by Col. McCoy, as apparently furnished by the FBI and given to Lt. Col. Garrett,
were examined to determine their connection, if any, with the so-called "Flying
Saucers". The specimens were carefully examined by both technicians of the
Analysis Division and Electronics Sub-division of Engineering Division. The
latter organization stated that these specimens definitely had no connection
whatsoever with the "Mogul" projects nor with any other research and development
projects of this Command.

2. It is also the opinion of this Command that these specimens have no
connection with the so-called "Flying Saucer" or "Discs". These specimens, there-
fore, are considered as part of a hoax that could be perpetrated by most anyone
seeking publicity or for any other reasons.

[REDACTED SECTION]

5. The specimens shown in the attached photographs include fragments of
an undeterminable shape made from plaster of Paris or similar ceramics and con-
taining some electrical resistance wire for measurement purposes. The condition
of the ceramics indicates that the resistance wire was heated electrically at
one time or another. If the other articles at the top of the photographs reading
from left to right are identified as follows:

a. An uncoiled type of magnetia [possible error in text: "magnetia" should be "magnetic"] deflectiongram made of aluminum
alloy, manufactured by The National Baldwin Co. of Salt Lake City, Utah, which
was at one time used by I. B. M. machines during I. Q. tests and is of no project.

UNCLASSIFIED

- page 8 -

There are no photographs included on this page of the document.

The text in the document reads:

b. The second and third articles are bakelite coil forms wrapped with ordinary thin enamel copper wire. These coils indicate that they were skillfully made at one time but were crudely rewrapped by one not familiar with the act of winding a coil. These coils also have no connection with any AMC project.

c. The fourth article is a metallic box which is the remains of an electrostatic filter condenser made by the Polymerics Manufacturing Co. of New York, N.Y. This article also has no connection with any AMC project.

d. The fifth article is the remains of a metallic magnetic ring that could not be identified as any part of any device used at this Command.

4. This information and attached photograph may be transmitted to the FBI to inform various agencies throughout the United States as to what action they deem necessary to take in the event of other similar specimens brought to their attention.

The majority of the text fields are blank or filled with placeholder lines and are unreadable due to the quality of the document. Additionally, there are redacted or obscured sections that I cannot reproduce.

- page 12 -

The image provided is a scanned document page that is mostly illegible due to its poor quality. Unfortunately, there are no clear photographs or text that can be discerned from this document. The text that is partially visible is redacted or too blurred to read, so I'm unable to act as an OCR system to output the content of this document. There also appears to be no distinguishable photographs or illustrations on the page.

- page 13 -

The document contains two photographic images near the top of the page and one at the bottom of the page. The images appear to be black-and-white reproductions of some sort, likely depicting unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The upper images feature two long, blurry markings that could be interpreted as rod-shaped objects captured in motion, with one darker than the other. The bottom image shows two objects or possibly parts of the same object with a dark area above them; it's more ambiguous and doesn't exhibit clear detail.

Here is the text as requested:

---

Incident #33 -- Hackensack, New Jersey -- 3 August 1947

It seems clear that no astronomical interpretation can 
be given to this incident.

Information is so meager that little else can be said.

If the object observed was only 200 yards away, it would seem
that witnesses could have furnished much more detailed informa-
tion.

Mrs. *************
Wildwood, New Jersey

Dear Mrs. ************:

With reference to your letter of 27 March 1948, this is to advise
you that Major W. T. Faulk left suddenly on leave due to pending transfer
orders. No information or film has been received since the departure
of Major Faulk who had been receiving all correspondence in connection
with the Wildwood sightings. Only one roll of film has been received;
the other two rolls mentioned, as well as additional information, may
possibly have been forwarded to Major Faulk at his leave address and
not as yet returned to this headquarters. The one roll of film re-
ceived was processed in the Photographic Laboratory with negative results.

For security reasons, it is impossible to keep you informed of
the official action being taken by this headquarters. However, an in-
vestigation has been initiated on the Wildwood, N. J., incidents.

This Command is making considerable effort to acknowledge receipt
of all information. Your cooperation, as well as the cooperation of
all individuals sufficiently interested in the security of their country,
is urgently required. It is hoped that you will continue to inform
this headquarters, as well as the P&eAC, of any new developments in
Wildwood. The official address for such correspondence is as follows:

The scan quality is poor and the handwriting is difficult to decipher, leading to many words being unintelligible or uncertain. Additionally, the text is partially obscured by whatever process was used to obscure the presumably classified information (This is indicated by the faded, blurry white patches and the word 'UNINTELLIGIBLE' in brackets). The document appears to be a memo or report with handwritten notes, possibly related to a sighting or UFO report, given the context provided in your question.
