(6) Heading: Approximately due north.

(7) Maneuverability: The objects followed a straight
course. When first sighted the objects on the left was an
apparent distance of five feet behind the first and with an
increase of speed overtook the first object in about two
seconds and continued on past the first object until they
were both out of sight.

(8) Altitude: Estimated at around 30,000 ft.

(9) Sounds: None.

(10) Exhaust trail or not: None observed.

6. General remarks: The times of observance by the witnesses
differ in that T/Sgt Morbeck observed them for about thirty seconds from
about ten o'clock until out of sight. While Maj Bullock observed them
at twelve o'clock for about fifteen seconds when he turned away to call
them to the attention of other personnel but the objects were out of sight
before this could be done. M/Sgt Pink observed them at twelve o'clock
for about twenty seconds until out of sight. All witnesses generally
agree to the above data.

When first sighted, the objects on the left was an apparent distance 
of two-feet behind the first object, and with a burst of speed,
overtakes the first object in about two seconds and flew in close
formation with the first object. This fact seems to preclude the
possibility that these objects were meteors.

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

   Objects followed a straight course. When first seen, the object on the left was
an apparent distance of five feet behind the first, and with an increase of speed over-
took the first object in about 2 seconds and flew in close formation with the first
object. This fact seems to preclude the possibility that these objects were meteors.

   Object was first sighted by M/Sgt Lorbcek, who was watching a B-25 pass over the
Field, and observed the objects passing above the B-25, going in the opposite direction,
and called them to the attention of Major Bullock and Majst Fink, who were standing near
by and remarked, "Are those airplanes? Boy! They are sure fast."

Subject: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena - 294

No sketch of the object is enclosed because all observers agreed the shape of the object was perfectly round and no details were visible due to the distance of the object from the observers. From personal and official contacts, the investigator believe all three observers are reputable and competent. A check of the local OSI detachment revealed nothing derogatory as regards any of the observers.
