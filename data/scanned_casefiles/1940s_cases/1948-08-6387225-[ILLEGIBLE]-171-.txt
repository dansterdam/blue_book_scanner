There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.

Perhaps the russians were experimenting with their own

It appears that there is a small, simplistic sketch or drawing of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the top right corner of the document page. The UFO resembles a classic "flying saucer" design, with a tapered rear end and what could be interpreted as flames or propulsion coming out from the back.

The text from the document reads as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

about Sunset or 3 Aug 47, about 25 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Moscow an experienced American newspaper reporter saw an unidentfied [sic] object at very high altitude. It was long and narrow and proceeding at a high, but not excessive speed in a generally southwest-northeast direction. It shone very brightly probably from reflected sunlight. No wings could be seen and no sound was heard. It looked like a rigid airship and was so identified by a Russian acquaintance who saw it at the same time. However, the reporter, in spite of the appearance of the object was of the opinion that it was not a rigid airship due principally to its high speed. He had no theory to offer.

NA COMMENT: This object might have been anything. Its speed seems insufficient for a guided missile, but it could have been either a jet or conventional airplane at unusual left combinations and fore-shortening frequently give aircraft a freakish appearance. The possibility that it was a dirigible should not be excluded. Inference "A" should not be excluded.

REFERENCE "A": The upper winds in Russia are not published but it was noted that on the following morning there were high surface winds with storm predictions.

PROBABLY FROM NEARBY CUMULUS. NO
WINGS COULD BE SEEN AND NO SOUND WAS
HEARD. IT LOOKED LIKE A FLUID METEOR,
AND WAS SO IDENTIFIED BY A RUSSIAN
ACQUAINTANCE WHO SAW IT AT THE SAME TIME.
THE REPORTER, HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE
APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT, WAS OF THE
OPINION THAT IT WAS NOT A RIGID METEOR,
DUE PRINCIPALLY TO ITS HIGH SPEED. HE HAD
NO THEORY TO OFFER, AND COULD ONLY
SAY THAT IT WAS A MYSTERY, LIKE THE
AMERICAN "FLYING SAUCERS”.

NO COMMENT. "THIS OBJECT MIGHT HAVE

INSUFFICIENT FOR A GUIDED MISSILE,
