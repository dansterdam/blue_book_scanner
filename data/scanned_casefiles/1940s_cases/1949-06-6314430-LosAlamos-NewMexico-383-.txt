There's a handwritten note at the bottom right corner which is not fully legible, it appears to say "A s[obscured] (meteor)".

The image features three hand-drawn diagrams at the bottom of the page. The leftmost drawing shows a side profile labeled "SIDE VIEW," with an elliptical shape and a small protrusion at the top labeled "Small Snorkel or Periscope." The middle drawing is labeled "BOTTOM OF SUB VIE/W" and appears to show a circular outline with a smaller concentric circle inside it. The rightmost drawing is labeled "REAR VIEW," and it shows a vertical line next to an elongated horizontal shape.

Unfortunately, the text in the document is mostly illegible due to the poor resolution and quality of the image. It seems to be a standard form with fields for "CASE NO.", "DATE", "TIME", "LOCATION", "REPORTED BY" and "INVESTIGATED BY" at the top. Below that, I can discern the word "COMMENT," but the actual text comment is not clear. The text accompanying the diagrams is also illegible, except for the words "AIR SPEED IND-" which are partially visible under the left diagram. It's not possible to accurately transcribe the text with the given quality of the image.
