2. According to astronomical authorities the phenomena described by Captain ------ coincide exactly with the appearance of aurora polaris (northern lights) as seen at latitudes as far south as Bermuda.

3. The newspaper article "Northern Lights Are Seen Here", which is circulated A-i, states that the auroras were visible in Bermuda 23 January beginning at a time close to that when Captain ------ first saw his phenomena. Furthermore, the lights were seen in a line of direction from Bermuda which approximates the position from where Captain ------ estimates his light mass to have been located when last seen.

4. A transcript of entries from the log of Hamilton Meteorological Station for the night in question has been requested.

5. It was further requested that Captain ------ and his crew be interviewed to determine whether the appearance of 'nearness' of the light mass could have been illusory caused, possibly, by a combination of cloud and water reflection and the intensity of the aurora.

subject, "Semi-Monthly Intelligence Summary," File 55th TRG 350.05,
dated 29 July 1947, the following report is submitted for the period ending
31 January 1949.

2.       On 21 January 1949, crew of B-29 aircraft, number 45-21768, returning
from a special search mission for Doc’smander IV, Star Ariel, observed the
following described atmospheric phenomena:

        a. At 0100Z, 24 min. flying from position 29° 50' N - 67° 29' W, on a
               true course of 050°, altitude 10,000 ft., Captain ————-, Aircraft
               Commander, first saw a red glow off this left wing which at first resembled the
               moon rising and which soon later became blinding white.

        b. At 0025Z, pilot turned the aircraft in direction of the light,
               530° true course, and within fifteen minutes the aircraft was so close to the red
               light object that a sharp bank was executed in order to avoid flying into the
               red light area.

        c. On approaching the redlight it was observed as a dark red glow,
1 to 1-1/2 miles wide, lying on the water, and resembling burning oil with a
phosphorescent red light, raised to 2,500 to 3,000 ft altitude. Also from heading
of 350° and 100° two columns of white light, 1/4 to 1/2 mile apart, resembling
search light beams and extending upward angle approximately 45°. Captain ————
estimates the beams were at a sight that turned towards the left of the focusing
light mass. If the white light beams had extended above the red light mass to
an altitude of 10,000 ft., they would have intersected. The white light appeared to
have had mass as it broke off enough light to illuminate the wings of the B-29 
and the bases of surrounding clouds with a dull red glow (squall condition?) 55

        d.  Aircraft position borne true red light area, 5,000 ft, altitude,
               at 0029Z, 29 Jan 49, was 3O° 01' N - 67° 04' W.

        e. That is the only programme reported or noticeable as light was
               due to the red glare.

        f.       Clouds were present, way to four tentacles of red faint balls at
               3,500 ft and tops to 5,000 ft.
                                                                      UNCLASSIFIED

                                                                                                 9-9397-8

New York, New York

1. Reference is made to your letter (373 D Wea 350.05) dated
9 February 1949, subject, "Semi-monthly Intelligence Report" concerning
sighting of light phenomenon by Captain [redacted], 24 January 1949.

2. According to astronomical authorities the phenomenon described
by Captain [redacted] coincides exactly with the appearance of aurora
borealis (northern lights) as seen at latitudes as far south as Bermuda.

3. The Newspaper article "Northern Lights Are Seen Here" which
is evaluated A-1, states that the aurora was visible in Bermuda, 21
January beginning at a time close to that when Captain [redacted] first
saw his phenomenon. Furthermore, the lights were seen in a line of
direction from Bermuda which passes through or near the position where
Captain [redacted] estimates his light mass to have been located when
last seen.

4. It is requested that a transcript of entries from the log
of Hamilton Meteorological Station for the night in question be for-
warded to this Command, Attention: MCIAO-X-3.

5. Request further that Captain [redacted] and his crew be inter-
viewed to determine whether the appearance of nearness of the light
mass could have been illusory caused, possibly, by a combination of
cloud and water reflection and the intensity of the aurora.

6. Four copies of "Guide to Investigation" are forwarded to aid
in recording the desired information.

2. On 21 January 1949, crew of B-29 aircraft, number 44-87650, returning from a special search mission over DAC grid HYR 1F, Star Aerial 3, observed the following described atmospheric phenomena:

a. At 0102Z, 24 Jan 49, from position in 29° 30' N - 67° 29' W, at an course of 050°, altitude 10,500 ft., Captain [Name redacted], Aircraft Commander, first saw a red glow off the left wing which at first resembled the moon rising and which the crew later believed to be a burning ship.

b. At 0205Z the pilot turned the aircraft in direction of the light, 350° true course, and within fifteen minutes the aircraft was so close to the red light on the water that a marker was expended in order to avoid flying into the red light mass.

c. On approaching the red light it was observed as a dark red glow, 1 to 1-1/2 miles rdia., based on the water, and resembling burning oil with a phosphorescent red light extending 2,500 to 3,000 ft altitude. Also from bearing of 350° and 150° two columns of vivid light, 1/4 to 1/2 mile apart, resembling search light beams and extending upward through approximately 3/4 of the red light mass. The beams were at a slight angle toward each other. Capt [Name redacted] estimates that if both the light beams had extended above the red light mass to an altitude ot 10,000 ft. they would have intersected. It was also observed that the red light mass gave off enough light to illuminate the surface of the water and the bases of surrounding clouds with a dull red glow (see inclosure #5)

UNCLASSIFIED

Mid-Ocean News article "Northern Lights Are Seen Here" dtd 25 Jan 49

Northern Lights Are Seen Here

For nearly six hours last night Bermudians were treated to the unusual sight of Northern Lights. Entries in the Hamilton Meteorological Station's log indicate that the Northern Lights or otherwise known as the Aurora Borealis — were visible from about 8:30 P.M. to 2 A.M. Appearing to the north-northwest, they began with a reddish hue and changed throughout the evening to a powerful white, which spread like a curtain.

The Lights which are seen frequently in the far North are rarely visible this far South. When they are seen in these latitudes the weather is exceptionally fine, the lighthouse station said. Last night conditions were still and fine.

John Jefferies, branch engineer for Cable and Wireless, Ltd., in Bermuda, said the service was subnormal from about 11 P.M. to 5 A.M. He explained the station experienced fading on the wireless circuits.

This was the first time interference due to the aurora had been noticed in Bermuda, he said, although in some other parts of the world it is not uncommon.

Mid-Ocean News article "Northern Lights Seen Here For Second Time" dated
25 Jan 1949

Northern Lights Seen Here For Second Time

Northern Lights were seen last night for the second time in succession
in the sky to the north and northwest.

A red-orange glow appeared to the north-northwest shortly after 9:30,
but was partially obscured by low clouds. The Hamilton Hotel's station re-
ported a faint aurora corralis at one o'clock. Radio reception was hampered
by the phenomena.

Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited reported severe currents in
their cables and complete wireless failure on wireless circuits. All cables
ways reported, the company stated, and the wireless messages received were
not for public service.

Capt. G. K. Flatcher of the Gascony was surprised as a lot of other
people when he first saw the display on Monday night. "It didn't look at first
what they were," he said this morning aboard his vessel.
     
This was the first time, Captain Flatcher said, that he had noticed
these lights so far south. In northern latitudes he had often seen them.
On these occasions he said they were more spectacular, with less red but more
blue and violet in their makeup.
