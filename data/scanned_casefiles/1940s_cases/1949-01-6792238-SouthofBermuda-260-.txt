2. According to astronomical authorities the phenomena described by Captain ------ coincide exactly with the appearance of aurora polaris (northern lights) as seen at latitudes as far south as Bermuda.

3. The newspaper article "Northern Lights Are Seen Here", which is circulated A-i, states that the auroras were visible in Bermuda 23 January beginning at a time close to that when Captain ------ first saw his phenomena. Furthermore, the lights were seen in a line of direction from Bermuda which approximates the position from where Captain ------ estimates his light mass to have been located when last seen.

4. A transcript of entries from the log of Hamilton Meteorological Station for the night in question has been requested.

5. It was further requested that Captain ------ and his crew be interviewed to determine whether the appearance of 'nearness' of the light mass could have been illusory caused, possibly, by a combination of cloud and water reflection and the intensity of the aurora.

subject, "Semi-Monthly Intelligence Summary," File 55th TRG 350.05,
dated 29 July 1947, the following report is submitted for the period ending
31 January 1949.

2.       On 21 January 1949, crew of B-29 aircraft, number 45-21768, returning
from a special search mission for Doc’smander IV, Star Ariel, observed the
following described atmospheric phenomena:

        a. At 0100Z, 24 min. flying from position 29° 50' N - 67° 29' W, on a
               true course of 050°, altitude 10,000 ft., Captain ————-, Aircraft
               Commander, first saw a red glow off this left wing which at first resembled the
               moon rising and which soon later became blinding white.

        b. At 0025Z, pilot turned the aircraft in direction of the light,
               530° true course, and within fifteen minutes the aircraft was so close to the red
               light object that a sharp bank was executed in order to avoid flying into the
               red light area.

        c. On approaching the redlight it was observed as a dark red glow,
1 to 1-1/2 miles wide, lying on the water, and resembling burning oil with a
phosphorescent red light, raised to 2,500 to 3,000 ft altitude. Also from heading
of 350° and 100° two columns of white light, 1/4 to 1/2 mile apart, resembling
search light beams and extending upward angle approximately 45°. Captain ————
estimates the beams were at a sight that turned towards the left of the focusing
light mass. If the white light beams had extended above the red light mass to
an altitude of 10,000 ft., they would have intersected. The white light appeared to
have had mass as it broke off enough light to illuminate the wings of the B-29 
and the bases of surrounding clouds with a dull red glow (squall condition?) 55

        d.  Aircraft position borne true red light area, 5,000 ft, altitude,
               at 0029Z, 29 Jan 49, was 3O° 01' N - 67° 04' W.

        e. That is the only programme reported or noticeable as light was
               due to the red glare.

        f.       Clouds were present, way to four tentacles of red faint balls at
               3,500 ft and tops to 5,000 ft.
                                                                      UNCLASSIFIED

                                                                                                 9-9397-8

New York, New York

1. Reference is made to your letter (373 D Wea 350.05) dated
9 February 1949, subject, "Semi-monthly Intelligence Report" concerning
sighting of light phenomenon by Captain [redacted], 24 January 1949.

2. According to astronomical authorities the phenomenon described
by Captain [redacted] coincides exactly with the appearance of aurora
borealis (northern lights) as seen at latitudes as far south as Bermuda.

3. The Newspaper article "Northern Lights Are Seen Here" which
is evaluated A-1, states that the aurora was visible in Bermuda, 21
January beginning at a time close to that when Captain [redacted] first
saw his phenomenon. Furthermore, the lights were seen in a line of
direction from Bermuda which passes through or near the position where
Captain [redacted] estimates his light mass to have been located when
last seen.

4. It is requested that a transcript of entries from the log
of Hamilton Meteorological Station for the night in question be for-
warded to this Command, Attention: MCIAO-X-3.

5. Request further that Captain [redacted] and his crew be inter-
viewed to determine whether the appearance of nearness of the light
mass could have been illusory caused, possibly, by a combination of
cloud and water reflection and the intensity of the aurora.

6. Four copies of "Guide to Investigation" are forwarded to aid
in recording the desired information.

2. On 21 January 1949, crew of B-29 aircraft, number 44-87650, returning from a special search mission over DAC grid HYR 1F, Star Aerial 3, observed the following described atmospheric phenomena:

a. At 0102Z, 24 Jan 49, from position in 29° 30' N - 67° 29' W, at an course of 050°, altitude 10,500 ft., Captain [Name redacted], Aircraft Commander, first saw a red glow off the left wing which at first resembled the moon rising and which the crew later believed to be a burning ship.

b. At 0205Z the pilot turned the aircraft in direction of the light, 350° true course, and within fifteen minutes the aircraft was so close to the red light on the water that a marker was expended in order to avoid flying into the red light mass.

c. On approaching the red light it was observed as a dark red glow, 1 to 1-1/2 miles rdia., based on the water, and resembling burning oil with a phosphorescent red light extending 2,500 to 3,000 ft altitude. Also from bearing of 350° and 150° two columns of vivid light, 1/4 to 1/2 mile apart, resembling search light beams and extending upward through approximately 3/4 of the red light mass. The beams were at a slight angle toward each other. Capt [Name redacted] estimates that if both the light beams had extended above the red light mass to an altitude ot 10,000 ft. they would have intersected. It was also observed that the red light mass gave off enough light to illuminate the surface of the water and the bases of surrounding clouds with a dull red glow (see inclosure #5)

UNCLASSIFIED

Mid-Ocean News article "Northern Lights Are Seen Here" dtd 25 Jan 49

Northern Lights Are Seen Here

For nearly six hours last night Bermudians were treated to the unusual sight of Northern Lights. Entries in the Hamilton Meteorological Station's log indicate that the Northern Lights or otherwise known as the Aurora Borealis — were visible from about 8:30 P.M. to 2 A.M. Appearing to the north-northwest, they began with a reddish hue and changed throughout the evening to a powerful white, which spread like a curtain.

The Lights which are seen frequently in the far North are rarely visible this far South. When they are seen in these latitudes the weather is exceptionally fine, the lighthouse station said. Last night conditions were still and fine.

John Jefferies, branch engineer for Cable and Wireless, Ltd., in Bermuda, said the service was subnormal from about 11 P.M. to 5 A.M. He explained the station experienced fading on the wireless circuits.

This was the first time interference due to the aurora had been noticed in Bermuda, he said, although in some other parts of the world it is not uncommon.

Mid-Ocean News article "Northern Lights Seen Here For Second Time" dated
25 Jan 1949

Northern Lights Seen Here For Second Time

Northern Lights were seen last night for the second time in succession
in the sky to the north and northwest.

A red-orange glow appeared to the north-northwest shortly after 9:30,
but was partially obscured by low clouds. The Hamilton Hotel's station re-
ported a faint aurora corralis at one o'clock. Radio reception was hampered
by the phenomena.

Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited reported severe currents in
their cables and complete wireless failure on wireless circuits. All cables
ways reported, the company stated, and the wireless messages received were
not for public service.

Capt. G. K. Flatcher of the Gascony was surprised as a lot of other
people when he first saw the display on Monday night. "It didn't look at first
what they were," he said this morning aboard his vessel.
     
This was the first time, Captain Flatcher said, that he had noticed
these lights so far south. In northern latitudes he had often seen them.
On these occasions he said they were more spectacular, with less red but more
blue and violet in their makeup.

ATTN: MCIAO-3

1. As requested in par 5, basic correspondence, Captain [Redacted], 
and crew have been interviewed (see Incls 2, 3, 1, 5, & 6). Navigation 
Lt. 1st Donald M. Austin was TDY to this headquarters from 375th Recon Sq, 
Eielson AFB, Alaska and has since returned to that organization. Radio 
Operator, Sgt Barker, was busy at radio panel and viewed little but 
briefly. Genax Scanlon, Sgt Cook, was operating an engineer's panel and 
did not view it with. Right Scanner, Sgt DeCharmi a is at present 30 
DDY to T/FO 210th Air Weather Group, Westover AFB, Mass.

2. All Officers and Airmen interviewed viewed phenomenon through 
plexiglass aircraft windows or blisters. No artificial aid to vision 
were used.

3. Approximately 5 to 15 miles from tho first mass Capt Natalie 
and 1st Stockton reported seeing the lights on a surface vessel.  Radio 
Operator, Sgt Barker was requested to contact it, however, contact 
could not be made.

4. Radio contact was good all during the flight and contact was 
maintained with Bermuda. However the radio operator does not remember 
if there was an undue amount of radio interference.

5. Radar Operator, Sgt[Redacted] operating radar set AN/APQ-13 had 
been receiving good results. Several surface vessels were picked-up 
in areas other than that where the phenomenon occurred. He was unable 
to pick-up surface vessel which was sighted in the vicinity, even-
though all ranges were tried. There was no indication on the scope 
at the vicinity of the phenomena. Sgt Snider could not get an indica-
tion on the radar scope until about 90 miles from Bermuda, at which 
time the island was picked-up.

6. All crew members who observed this phenomenon stated that 
it vas not illusory and did not seem to be a reflection. It seems 
hardly feasible that it was an illusory condition caused by the Nor-
thern Lights as there was no visible display of them at that time. 
"Northern Lights" as referred to in cited news article was the light 
flares he described.

7. Log of the meteorological station at Hamilton, Bermuda could 
not be obtained through usual service channels. It was, however, learned 
by ltr party ZI, that on January [Redacted] (see Incl #7), local Time 1700, 
17 Jan 1949, Island Time 173, Bermuda has been estimated, Incl #9).

    New York, New York

1. Reference is made to your letter (373 D Wea 350.05) dated
9 February 1949, subject, "Semi-monthly Intelligence Report" concern-
ing sighting of light phenomenon by Captain Mateerall, 24 January 1949.

2. According to astronomical authorities the phenomenon described
by Captain [REDACTED] coincides exactly with the appearance of aurora
borealis (northern lights) as seen at latitudes as far south as Bermuda.

3. The Newspaper article "Northern Lights Are Seen Here" which
is evaluated A-1, states that the aurora was visible in Bermuda 21
January beginning at a time close to that when Captain [REDACTED] first
saw his phenomenon. Furthermore, the lights were seen in a line of
direction from Bermuda which passes through or near the position where
Captain [REDACTED] estimates his light mass to have been located when
last seen.

4. It is requested that a transcript of entries from the log
of Hamilton Meteorological Station for the night in question be for-
warded to this Command, Attention: MCIAO-X-3.

5. Request further that Captain [REDACTED] and his crew be inter-
viewed to determine whether the appearance of nearness of the light
mass could have been illusory caused, possibly, by a combination of
cloud and water reflection and the intensity of the aurora.

6. Four copies of "Guide to Investigation" are forwarded to aid
in recording the desired information.

                                 FOR THE COMMANDING GENERAL:

dated 7 July 1947, the following report is submitted for the period ending
31 January 1949.

2. On 21 January 1949 crew of B-29 aircraft, number 44-87750, returning
from a special search mission for SAAC under 1st, Star Aerial, observed the
following described atmospheric phenomena:

a. At 2150Z, 24 Jan 49, from position in 29° 50' N - 67° 29' W, on a
course of 050°, Altitude 10,500' A. Captain, aircraft commander, Aircraft
Commander, First saw a red glow off the left wing which at first resembled the
moon rising and which the crew later believed to be a burning ship.

b. At 0252Z the pilot turned the aircraft in direction of the light,
350° true course, and within fifteen minutes the aircraft was so close to the re
light on the that a sharp bank was executed in order to avoid flying into the
red light mass.

c. On approaching the redlight it was observed as a dark red glow,
1 to 1-1/2 miles wide, based on the water, and resembling burning oil with a
phosphorescent red light rising to 2,500 to 3,000 ft altitude. Also from bearing
of 350° and 150° two columns of white light, 1/4 to 1/2 mile apart, resembling
search light beams and extending upward through approximately 3/4 of the red
light mass. The beams were at a slight angle toward each other. Captain made
estimates that if the white light beams had extended above the red light mass to
an altitude of 10,000 ft. they would have intersected. It was also observed that
the red light mass gave off enough light to illuminate the surface of the water
and the bases of surrounding clouds with a dull red glow (see inclosure #5)

d. Aircraft position abeam the red light, 3858, 6,000 ft. altitude,
at 0020Z, 25 Jan 49, was 31° 21' N - 57° 08' W

e. Wind at 5,000 ft was from 025° with velocity at 45 m.p.h.

f. Clouds 70%, How to 3/4 CuNim containing coverage, with bases at
6,300 ft. Tops, 12,300 ft.

Mid-Ocean News article "Northern Lights Are Seen Here" dtd 25 Jan 49

Northern Lights Are Seen Here

For nearly six hours last night Bermudians were treated to the un-
usual sight of Northern Lights. Entries in the Hamilton Meteorological
Station's log indicate that the northern lights or otherwise known as the
Aurora Borealis — were visible from about 9.30 P. M. to 2 A. M. Appear-
ing to the north-northwest, they began with a reddish hue and changed
throughout the evening to a powerful white, which spread like a curtain.

The Lights which are seen frequently in the far North are very visible
this far South. When they are seen in these latitudes the area ther is ex-
ceptionally fine, the log station said. Last night conditions were were
still and fine.

John Jeffries, branch engineer for Cable and Wireless, Ltd., in Bermuda,
said the service was unnormal from about 11 P. M. to 6 A. M. As expected
he explained the station experienced fading on the wireless circuits.

This was the first time interference due to the aurora had been noticed
in Bermuda, he said, although in some other parts of the world it is not
uncommon

Northern Lights Seen Here For Second Time

Northern Lights were seen last night for the second time in succession
in the sky to the north and northwest.

A red-orange glow appeared to the north-northwest shortly after 9:50,
but was partially obscured by low clouds. The Hamilton Hotel’s station re-
ported a faint aurora coronaalis at one o’clock. Radio reception was hampered
by the phenomena.

Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited reported severe currents in
their cables and complete wireless failure on wireless circuits. All cables
ways requested, the company stated, and the wireless messages received were
not for public service. 

Capt. G. K. Flather of the Gascony was surprised as a lot of other
people when he first saw the display on Monday night. "I didn’t know at first
what they were," he said this morning aboard his vessel.

This was the first time, Captain Flather said, that he had noticed
these lights so far south. In northern latitudes he had often seen them.
On these occasions he said they were more spectacular, with less red but more
blue and violet in their makeup.

1. In compliance with 308th Reconnaissance Group (Weather) letter,
   subject: "Semi-Monthly Intelligence Summary," File 308th WEA 330.05,
   dated 29 July 1947, the following report is submitted for the period
   ending 31 January 1949.

2. On 2h January 1949 crew of B-29 aircraft, number 44-87750, re-
   turning from a special search mission for BOAC Tudor IV, Star Aerial,
   observed the following described atmospheric phenomena:

   a. At 2100Z, 21 January, from position 29°30'N 62°00'W an 
      unusual course of 050° at altitude 19,500 ft. Captain [REDACTED], 
      Aircraft Commander, first saw a red glow off the left wing which at first
      resembled the moon rising and which the crew later believed to be a burn-
      ing ship.

   b. At 02052Z the pilot turned the aircraft in direction of the 
      light, 350° true course, and within fifteen minutes the aircraft was so
      close to the red light's object that a sharp bank was executed in order to
      avoid flying into the red light mass.

   c. On approaching the redlight it was observed as a dark red 
      glow, 1 to 1½ miles wide, based on the water, and resembling burning 
      oil with a phosphorescent red light rising to 2,500 to 3,000 ft. alti-
      tude. Also from headings of 350° and 160° two columns of white light,
      bore a 15° approx., resembling search light beams and extending upward
      through elliptical 3/5 of a the red light mass. The beams were at a
      slight angle toward each other. Capt. [REDACTED] estimates that if the
      white light beams had extended above the red light mass to an altitude
      of 10,000 ft. they would have intersected. It was also observed that
      the red light mass gave off enough light to illuminate the surface of
      the water and the bases of surrounding clouds with a dull red glow (see
      inclosure #5).

e. Wind at 6,000 ft. was from 025° with velocity of 25 knots.

f. Clouds were present, two to four tenths coverage, bases

h. Communications were reported good at that time.

i. Cp________ reports the aircraft as staying in the area
approximately 45 minutes and completely circling and surveying the red
light mass from all angles.

j. Photographer aboard special mission aircraft reported at-
tempting to photograph the phenomena with a K-20 camera at shutter speed
of 1/25th second and lens setting of f.5. Due to fast shuttver speed
no result was obtained even though 15 prints were overdeveloped in an
attempt to bring out details.

k. Last observation made at 0212Z, 25 Jan 49, looking down

The object is depicted against a dark background, which could be the sky or sea, with lighter shapes that could represent clouds or disturbances above the object.

Mid-Ocean News article "Northern Lights Are Seen Here" dtd 25 Jan 49

Northern Lights Are Seen Here

For nearly six hours last night Bermudians were treated to the unusual sight of Northern Lights. Entries in the Hamilton Meteorological Station's log indicate that the Northern Lights -- otherwise known as the aurora borealis -- were visible from about 5:30 P.M. to 2 A.M., appearing to the north-northwest, they began with a reddish hue and changed throughout the evening to a powerful violet, which spread like a curtain.

The lights which are seen frequently in the far north are rarely visible this far South. When they are seen in these latitudes the weather is exceptionally fine, the Met Station said. Last night conditions here were still and fine.

John Jefferies, branch engineer for Cable and Wireless, Ltd., in Bermuda, said the service was abnormal from about 11 P.M. to 5 A.M. As expected an explained the station experienced fading on the wireless circuits.

This was the first time interference due to the aurora had been noticed in Bermuda, he said, although in some other parts of the world it is not uncommon.

Northern Lights Seen Here For Second Time

Northern Lights were seen last night for the second time in succession
in the sky to the north and northwest.

A red-orange glow appeared to the north-northwest shortly after 9:30,
but was partially obscured by low clouds. The Hamilton Met station re-
ported a faint aurora borealis at one o'clock. Radio reception was hampered
by the phenomenon.

Cables and Wireless (West Indies) Limited reported earth currents in
their cables and complete wireless failure on wireless circuits. All cables
were received, the company stated, and the wireless messages received were
not for public service.

Capt. G. H. Fletcher of the Gascony was as surprised as a lot of other
people when he first saw the display on Monday night. "I didn't know at first
what they were," he said this morning aboard his vessel.

This was the first time, Captain Fletcher said, that he had noticed

On these occasions he said they were more spectacular, with less red but more
