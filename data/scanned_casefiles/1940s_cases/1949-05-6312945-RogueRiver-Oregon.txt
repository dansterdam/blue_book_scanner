File No. 24-33

DETAILS:

AT GOLD BEACH, OREGON

1. On 8 August 1949, Mrs. [REDACTED] of Gold Beach, Oregon, was interviewed and advised that at approximately 1700 hours, 24 May 1949, she and four other persons, while fishing on the Rogue River near Elephant Rock approximately 13 miles above the highway bridge near Gold Beach, Oregon, sighted an object described as being round in shape, silver in color, and about the size of a C-47 aircraft. When first brought to Mrs. [REDACTED] attention by one of the other witnesses, the object appeared to be three or four miles away. It was coming from the east, but later turned to the southwest. It appeared to be traveling at the same rate of speed as a C-47. It made no noise, left no exhaust trail, and made no maneuvers. The interviewee stated that she was not familiar with aircraft; therefore, she could not estimate with any accuracy the speed or altitude at which the object was traveling. Mrs. [REDACTED] made the comparison between the object and a C-47 because she is familiar with that type aircraft. Her son has pointed out C-47's to her as they flew over Gold Beach. The position of the observer at the time of sighting is as follows: 42° 25' North Latitude and 124° 24' West Longitude.

AT MEDFORD, OREGON

2. On 22 September 1949, personnel of the CAA Weather Station, Medford Airport, Medford, Oregon, advised that there are no reports available exclusively for Gold Beach and vicinity. However, available weather charts for the coastal area indicate the coast was open and clear on 24 May 1949.
