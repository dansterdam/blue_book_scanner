Incident #1088 - Bakersfield, California -- 8 March 1948

It is extremely unlikely that this object was of 
astronomical origin. See report on incident #106.

Although the hour of observation is not stated in 
the witness's report of incident #107, it is possible, judging
by the information which is given, that #107 and #108 refer to
the same object or objects.

SUBJECT: Investigation of Flying Discs

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

Information from the Sheriff's Office, Bakersfield, California, revealed 
that numerous calls from residents in Bakersfield concerning peculiar objects
in the sky over Bakersfield, prompted an investigation by their office and
contact with A-2 headquarters Fourth Air Force. 

On 13th March 1948, two informants, Mr. ________ and Mr. ________,
husband and wife, stated that they observed a flying object which appeared to be
composed in shape and left a brownish-white plume of smoke, which suddenly
stopped and flared, spread, somewhat lighter, what appeared to be a parachute,
was seen to be drifting to the east.

The object, as described, appeared to be a burning fabric airplane,
consumed in smoke. Observations were made in Bakersfield of object to be
the south and southwest, approximately ten to twelve miles distance, around 
1500 hours on 5 March 1948. 

On 13th March 1948, informant, Mr. ________ stated that he observed
an object at 0630, 6 March 1948, due north of Bakersfield, approximately five
miles distance. The object was a large, orange-red ball of fire, somewhat
larger than a small airplane, appeared to remain static for approximately two
to three seconds, then split and continued to burn; was then visible as a burning 
ball. A parachute, with a black object hanging was then observed to fall,
drift to the east and disappeared into the hills east of Bakersfield.

On 13th March 1948, two informants, Mr. ________, secretary,
Haberfelde Building, Bakersfield, California, and Dr. ________, dentist
Haberfelde Building, Bakersfield, California, stated that they were in
Room 513, Haberfelde Building, on the morning of 9 March 1948. Mrs. ________,
was a patient of Dr. ________. Both informants stated that they observed a
flaming object which appeared to first to be a very small airplane. On 
nearer observation they appeared the object with a considerable black smoke 
trailing in a zigzag manner for approximately 1000 to 5000 feet. The
object was observed at 1,000 feet, approximately due north of Bakersfield,
seven to ten miles distant at approximately 0630 hours.

Informants further stated that the object disappeared behind a water
tower, ________ was an observation to their view, and was near the ground.
Both informants watched for an explosion, thinking that it would explode
upon reaching the ground, but nothing unusual was noted.
