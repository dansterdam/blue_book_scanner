9:20 Richmond Called regarding some very peculiar object they had on their scope. It didn't seem to be moving at all. They, 
wanted something done about it immediately. They are checking CAA, Wright Field, etc., to see if they can offer 
any suggestions. Richmond requested that we turn in a report of our conversation demanding immediate action. 
They are checking with CAA, Washington. 

10:19 Richmond Called regarding that balloon or whatever it was, they first contacted us about. It's definitely on the ground now, rec-
ords indicate it's not a balloon, but what it is no one knows. They are requesting immediate investigation. 
They could give us no assist on the type plane which might be available.
The conversation ended at this time with Richmond stating, "You will hear about this; it's something that you may
be flying around with up there one of these days." 

10:48 Lorain Called, CAA gave them information on the object Richmond has been checking with us. Indicates it's quite large, 
radar indicates about 100ft. in diameter, the object is on the ground impossible to move. Of-course all they have is 
radar to go by. They believe definitely its no weather balloon or any type aircraft known to them. It's not an air-craft 
at all, as we usually know it. 

11:22 Richmond Richmond still demanding immediate investigation, regarding above. 

REMARKS (Cont'd) 

11:45 Pittsburgh Very excitedly reports object on their radar scope, very distinct return, requested they alert for it immediately as Richmond 
had already reported this object. Pittsburgh radar indicated not cloud formations anywhere near there, this object 
can be nothing more than evidencing object just hanging in mid-air. It's not moving at all... 

11:49 Richmond Richmond reported object definitely not a balloon, nor an aircraft as we know it. It's something of an enigma to everyone. 
They can not furnish any plane for any sort of investigation, wants our people to handle this through appropriate 
channels. They believe the thing, whatever it is, came down in vicinity Uniontown, Pa. Estimated time of fall between 
0930 & 1000. 

11:20 Cleveland Filed a report of telephonic conversation.

Flying Saucer Season Here Again
Four Uniontown People Report Seeing Soaring Dinner-Plates,
Forerunning Editors to Brace Themselves for a Flock of Inquiries

By Pat Oâ€™Neill
Post-Gazette Staff Writer

The flying saucer is upon us again, unless the air is filled with anything the wind and whirling wash can dream up â€“ like the pale of flying antipers to take the about-nigh that filled the skies for the last year.

But this time the flying saucer reports have already made one express line. The people of Uniontown, Pa., spent considerable time on June 30 explaining the common electric saucer executed by Mrs. Margaret Holler, Charles Schnell, Mrs. Catherine MacDonald and her daughter, Catherine. All reported a display of flying dinner-plates in the Pittsburgh road sector.

It is that time of year when editors brace themselves to take any reports from citizens who

phenomena strictly out of the Apocalypse.

Last year the flying saucers whirled their feverish gyrations to Moscow where radio stations popular with the Texan impromptus of Moscow. Now the influence of the celestial strayed only to the common Men in high command.

Sheepy Displeased
By Central Park

NEW YORK, July 2 (UP) â€“ Central Park's sheep meadow had sheep in it Friday for the first time in almost 15 years. But they didn't stay long. Movie makers wanted a pastoral scene. They waited for the park's sleep fascination with the background. Annually with the lovers of Mendabi they tinted sheep. So they turned a dozen loose in the meadows.

Within ten minutes it was as empty as a wolf's again. One sheep was in the Tavern-and-the-Green. One gigged out into Columbus Circle. Some hid in the park's zoo. It was three o'clock, and one bird before hours before all the sheep were back in the meadow.

(continued in the early '30s.

Take the goldfish raisers, for instance. The persistent attempts at

all with the genius carp had all its golden delusions. It had an

value as a dubious nutritional prize-value.

Another possibility is that the observers saw a beacon

Witness saw a luminous, oval-shaped object flying at an altitude of
approx 5,000 ft which was traveling beneath the base of some scattered cloud
from southwest to northeast across the sky. The weather was stormy and
cloudy and as a second object flew across the sky a flash of lightening
could be seen thru it. It seemed to be transparent. The objects(?) 
traveled very fast and seemed to just disappear within 10 seconds. Each
observed it approximately five minute intervals. There was no odor
or sound etc from the. However, a trail of light about a yard long was
observed. The objects rolled vertically on their edges and appeared to b
spinning end end across the sky. Witnesses lost sight of the objects 
as neighboring houses obstructed their view.
