the Flying disc story, and their actual part in the story. United Airlines pilot, 
********, states that ******** and ********* on July 31, 1947, both related their
original Flying disc fragment story. Information gathered would indicate that
the anonymous phone calls were possibly made by these ********* in order to build

remnants of the disc were reported to have showered down on the boat he was 
on causing some damage and killing his dog. ******** on the same boat, reported
to the home of ****** at ******. Tacoma, Washington to check with
him on this Flying disc story. ****** stated that as soon as he could recall, that it
was just a few days after the first Flying disc stories had appeared in the paper
and was on a Sunday evening. He believed it was the early part of June. ******* 
stated that ***** took him in the kitchen and proceeded to talk about this Flying
disc story in low muffled tones. He then stated ********** asked ******* suspicions,

telling ***** to admit that the Flying disc story was a plain fart boyish hoax and

and it was an entire hoax. **** stated that in view of the enraged condition of ***** wife, he immediately left and reported to the Seattle Post Intelligencer that the entire story was a hoax and that they should not print it in any way.
He further stated that he advised the Seattle Post Intelligencer that **** was

All five of the men then went down to the lobby where █████ detached himself from the group and entered a phone booth to call for a car from McChord Field and ██████ also left the group and met ██████ outside the phone booth where they held a short discussion relative to the credibility of █████ story. █████ indicated to █████ that he should attempt to find out if the story was on the level and that █████ would call him the followind day regarding this matter. The group then proceeded to the front of the hotel at which time █████ brought his car to the front of the line and took from his trunk a box of the alleged flying disc fragments picked up on Saury Island. He offered them to █████ ████████ and when the latter had looked, ██████ had the box of fragments placed in the car with two other officers. ██████ departed alone and █████ went in search of his companions to get another car to return to the hotel for the night.

From the morning of Friday morning, August 1, 1947, ██████ received a call ████████ in Chilton that a B-25 had crashed during the night and it was believed to be the same plane which had crashed with flying disc. Following this call ███████ called me on the phone to room and from the room ██████ again called McChord Field in an attempt to get information from the switchboard operator took the phone from █████ and spoke to a Colonel ██████ identifying himself and asking if the General had crashed.

at the fragments which were still in the room did suggest that they drive out to
the Smelter near Tacoma as he believed the slag at the Smelter would bear a
distinct resemblance to these fragments. The three men then drove to the Smelter
and the slag was noted to be definitely similar to the remnants which and

The original sighting as given by********man and********* Dahl was to the effect that ********, while patrolling in his boat near Maury Island, Washington, sighted six flying discs, one of which fluttered to the earth and disintegrated, showering his boat with fragments which caused some damage to the boat and killed his dog.****** also stated that he had taken pictures of the discs he had seen but the pictures were marred with white spots.

The following day****** went to Maury Island to verify what****** had told him regarding the disc fragments. At this time, Dahl picked up Several fragments and stated that he also saw one of the discs hovering over the Island but that it disappeared into a cloud.

Sometime during June or July, Ray Palmer of Ziff-Davis Company, which published Fantastic adventure magazines, received a letter from****** in which****** related his disc story and also submitted some fragments of the alleged flying disc. Ray Palmer then hired****** to go to investigate the sighting.

On the evening of July 31****** tried to arrange a meeting between****** and******, and two Army intelligence officers. Dahl refused to attend the meeting but****** attended and related the entire Event to them. As the two officers were leaving Crisman gave them some fragments of the alleged disc. Unfortunately, as the two officers were returning to Hamilton AFB, the B-25 in which they were flying crashed and both officers were killed.

The following day Several newspapers received anonymous calls to the effect that the B-25 had been shot down by a 20 mm cannon so that the disc samples could not be analyzed and these calls were responsible for the news accounts that insinuated that the B-25 had been sabotaged.

---

The samples of the "flying disc" were very similar to the slag
found at a nearby foundry. ------ admitted that the sample that
was sent to Palmer was not of any disc.

An investigation of the B-25 crash showed that an exhaust stack
had burned out on the left engine which caused a fire in the left
wing which subsequently broke off the wing and the tail section.
The plane at that time was carrying both intelligence officers, a
hitch-hiker and a Crew Chief. The Crew Chief and the hitch-hiker
parachuted to safety but both intelligence officers were killed.

On August 7------ and ------ were again interviewed by government
representatives. Both denied that the fragments were parts of a
flying disc. They stated that they had sent some rock samples to
Palmer for analysis and that Palmer had asked them if these samples
could have been part of a flying disc. They stated that he passed this
all off as a joke. They stated that the rock samples were parts
of a disc because that's what Palmer wanted them to say. ------- 
stated that they mostly talked to Arnold and the intelligence
officers about flying and that no one was very interested in the
rock samples they had found.

The case is considered a hoax and no other action was deemed neces-
sary.

UNCLASSIFIED 

AN INCIDENT REPORTED ON CRASHED FLYING SAUCERS

SUMMARY

The investigation of this incident was predicated upon a
letter, dated 26 November 1949, to the OSI from the FBI. It 
was pointed out that Bruce Cabot, a motion picture actor, had
reported of hearing a fantastic story told by a Mr. Newton 
concerning a crash of two flying saucers. 

Cabot said that according to Newton, the disks contained 
men and he had in his possession bits of clothing worn by these 
men. 

The OSI expended considerable efforts attempting to con-
tact the various people concerned to get all possible details. 
Mr. Newton turned out to be most uncooperative and the case was 
finally closed concluding that the whole matter was a hoax.

Incident #78 -- Grand Canyon, Arizona -- 30 June 1947

While it seems more probable that the objects sighted in this incident were freely-falling, man-made instruments, perhaps from bursted instrument balloons, the possibility of their being freely-falling meteorites is not completely ruled out. When the mass of an in-coming meteorite is of the proper order of magnitude, the meteor can come in on a non-vertical path, becomes a bright bolide, or fireball, and have its horizontal speed component reduced essentially to zero. It then falls to earth as a non-luminous, freely-falling body.

(COPY OF CLIPPING)

DECIDES TO TELL

EX-RANCHER SAYS HE SAW
FLYING SAUCERS 4 TIMES

   An ex-Lake County turkey
rancher said here today that he
saw "flying saucers" four times
in a period of four years.
   Now living at 564 55th Street,
Cleet H. Ballard, former Oakland
building contractor, said he de-
cided to tell about them after
hearing a news broadcast Satur-
day that the Air Force, which
once discounted the saucer 
stories, is interested.
    Ballard had a turkey ranch on 
Spruce Grove Rd., east of
Lower Lake, until four months
ago.
OBJECT FLUTTERS DOWN
    In 1947, he said, he saw a
circular object fluttering down 
from the sky. It landed in a field
and he picked it up, he said. It
was about 12 inches in diameter
and had lines radiating from the
center. Between the lines were
printed strange characters, simi-
lar to Oriental writing, which he
could not read.
    Ballard said he kept the disc,
which was made of heavy paper,
for several days, then burned it.
    Now he believes that it might
be a chart from one of the mys-
terious flying objects he saw
later.

The first "saucer" he saw was
in June or July, 1947, Ballard
said.
    (It was in June, 1947, that
Kenneth Arnold, Boise, Ida., fly-
ing businessman, reported seeing
nine mysterious objects over
western Washington and started
the "saucer" stories.)
SPILLED TO TURKEYS
    Ballard said his attention was
drawn to the flying object by his
his turkey herd. All the turkeys,
which he said notice everything
that flies, were looking up as it
whizzed by heading due north-
East wife, Juanita, also saw the
object. It made no sound and left
no trail of any kind, Ballard said.
    Twice more he saw similar
objects, appearing to be round,
fly over his ranch. The fourth
time was last October, when one
of them came plummeting out
of the sky from great altitude,
then stopped in mid-air for about
a minute and shot upwards again.
    A neighboring Lake County
rancher, Fred Topsey, also saw
it, Ballard said.
    The Air Force at Hamilton
Air Force base said it would send
an intelligence officer to inter-
view Ballard.

The image contains two illustrations related to the observation of an unidentified object. The first illustration is a side profile view depicting angles of elevation against a background with buildings and clouds, suggesting a way to measure the angle of the object above the horizon. It is accompanied by an angle scale on the left, which ranges from the horizon (0°) up to the zenith (90°). The second illustration is a compass rose, labeled with cardinal and intercardinal directions, to indicate the direction where the object was seen.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you lost sight. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you lost the object.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? ________

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Incident #78 -- Grand Canyon, Arizona -- 30 June 1947

While it seems more probable that the objects sighted in this incident were freely-falling, man-made instruments, perhaps from bursted instrument balloons, the possibility of their being freely-falling meteorites is not completely ruled out. When the mass of an in-coming meteorite is of the proper order of magnitude, the meteor can come in on a non-vertical path, become a bright bolide, or fireball, and have its horizontal speed component reduced essentially to zero. It then falls to earth as a non-luminous, freely-falling body.

Dear Sir:

The following, in general, are the facts regarding the flying disc story that started by [redacted text] the Macon Times, the son with subsequently related that news concerning the same. [redacted text] a fisherman named Dahl & son Fred in their B-25 occupying Army Intelligence Officers was shot down or gathered over Kelso, Washington on August 1, 1947 because it was carrying some Flying disc fragments.

The original story, as related by [redacted text] and [redacted text] was to the effect that, while patrolling in his boat near Maury Island, Washington, sighted six flying discs, one of which fluttered to the earth and disintegrated, showering his boat with great gobs which caused some damage to the boat and killed his dog. [redacted text] wrote a letter to me in Chicago, sending him fragments of the flying disk and relating the above story. [redacted text] requested Trans-Radio News in Chicago to verify this story as related by [redacted text] and this office has been working the story now.

[redacted text] then engaged and when [redacted text] Boise, Idaho, confirming first story, sighting the flying disc and [redacted text] had previously made a contract report, a story regarding the flying disc, to come to Tacoma and check the story as related by [redacted text].

[redacted text] came to Tacoma, Washington July 30, 1947 and arranged for a meeting the following day, July 31, with [redacted text] in his room 502, Winthrop Hotel, Tacoma, Washington. [redacted text] called to attend the meeting, Captain [redacted text], United Airlines Pilots who had also reported seeing flying disc fragments, and Army Intelligence to attend.
