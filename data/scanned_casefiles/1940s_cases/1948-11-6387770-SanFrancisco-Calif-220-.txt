Incident #220 -- San Francisco, California -- 23 November 1948

There is good reason to believe that the object observed
in this incident was a bolide. The fact that the observer, although
a common soldier, conducted his own experiment with vapor is strong
evidence that he is well-endowed with those phenomena a correct ap-
praisal stationery in the sky over a relatively long period of time.
While the evidence is insufficient to establish with any certainty
that the object was a bolide, it appears to this investigator, none
the less, to be the most probable explanation.

Name and address of observer: [Redacted information] San Francisco Calif
Occupation and hobbies: Teacher in science at Francisco Jr High School

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of
observer(s):
[Redacted information] is above average intelligence and reliable. However, he has near-sighted and wears glasses. He was not wearing glasses while using the binoculars, therefore his vision with glasses is 20-20. An attempt by this writer and Mr Thatcher to trace the course of the object with the aid of a star map met with negative results. Mr [Redacted information] could not even give an approximate course. 

NARRATIVE SUMMARY

Mr [Redacted information] was studying the constellations on the night of 29 Nov 1948 while in his backyard at [Redacted information], San Francisco, Calif., using a this maxima optical clarity and magnification in the immediate area was a pair of 7X binoculars. At 2115 he sighted a glowing object to the east heading in a north northwesterly direction. Object did not appear to be either a comet or a meteor in that it did not stream fire or light. It was spherical in shape and emitted a steady glow.
[Redacted information] claimed it did not appear to be associated with the object. He followed the object thru the binoculars until it passed from view to the north over a low bank which had buildings over 10 feet in height. Ater the object had disappeared [Redacted information] simulated his movements again and stated that the total time the object was in sight was approximately seven seconds. In [Redacted information]'s opinion the object was approximately 35 to 40° above the horizon. He thought the object appeared to be traveling too fast for a plane.
