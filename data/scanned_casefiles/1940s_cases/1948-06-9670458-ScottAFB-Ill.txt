Incident #31 — Belleville, Illinois — 20 June 1948

It appears improbable that this incident has an astrono-
mical explanation. If the evidence is correct as given, the object
could not have been a fireball. The zig zag course and the rela-
tively slow speed do not fit in with the description of a large
meteor. Lack of flare and train also tend to rule out this hypo-
thesis.

The description answers that of a lighted balloon rela-
tively close by.
