Carolina Galvanization at the Marriot Stadium. He also advised that he attended the above expo during all performances with the exception of one night performance and that he did not observe any unidentified object or light in the vicinity of the stadium and specially no reports by certain sections of Charlotte have been universally false that his positive attitude with relation to any unusual objects would have no bearing as to his refusal although strong emissions of light & unidentified objects in the sky. (--)2

(8)   On 20 MAY 1949, Mr. -----, Executive Director 526 Sbd (Subd Division), Civil Aeronautics Administration, Charlotte, N.C., stated that he has not heard of any unidentified object having been sighted over this stadium and that there has been no change in the flight patterns or landings there to appoint this stadium since before the incident. Control towers were held to .steal in civil atmospheric space for fear of escalation with the regular operation of the stadium, an advisement which he himself is charged with the coordination of this state civil airflight. He has heard of the lighting and there objects but never any direct contact. (--)2

The only alertness with the anti-bomb for the staff station and across Charlotte Station 24 is there entirely on the other side of his residence, there have been no alerts in this facility during the past three years, there has never been any aircraft current on these types, which could account for the rumor or short calls. He advised that there are two or the insulators and that one extends across the stadium in the direction of approximately 55 degrees from north, his antenna is fastened to two of poles which lie across the field, with one arc located on his house floor. The stadium, approximately 50 feet above the general track around this central stair is approximately 275 feet long and is constructed of Cobra approximately 60 feet long, which extends from the northeast end, by an insulator which is approximately twelve (12) inches long and is made of Pyrex. Mr. --- advised that no lights whatsoever appear on the above antenna and stated that he does not know whether the above mentioned insulator could reflect light. He further stated that he knows of nothing in connection with the above equipment which would represent an unusual appearance such as he has reported no specific resident in the international flight.

When he first pointed it out to his brother-in-law, Mr. ****** ******, who was standing nearby, it did not show up in the 7-inch telescope they had been using to observe an old weather satellite in space. When the object was in a few minutes he had taken his seat at the steadman that he returned to look toward the sky, He was sitting in the North side of the building and as the object was observed at an angle of approximately 150-200 yards North and at about 75-100 yards above the horizon. He watched the object for approximately two hours and states that it did not change position with respect to the stars. The object is that it had no motion at all as it appeared to be fixed, with a steady or constant amber light which gave off some scintillations along the side of the object but no blinking of lights as might be expected if the navigation lights of an aircraft object, the size of the object was estimated at an overall length of 50 feet, with a width approximately 10 feet with a series of windows or port lights, evenly spaced. 7 long the under carriage was also a row of what should be windows or lights of some nature. Nothing in the front. The object was still in the sky in the same location when he stopped observing about 11PM, it appeared then that it was no longer visible but could not locate it. The object did not move in any direction during all this period that he observed it. This did not seem like a meteor or shooting star. The length of the object abut 50 feet, fuselage diameter about 10 feet. The silver length of the fins 10 to 12 feet, probably 20,000 feet in the air. He said that it was one of Orient in the Manga's observations over a period of seven years. He has not at anytime seen any strange objects that that may have been only aerial situations.

Has not at anytime for approximately 0.7% last year and although he has logged approximately 75 hours time during this past year over five previous years, he was not familiar with any type of said meteor of the Fairview Mountain. His wife substantiated his viewing this object, stating that he was never able to recall what it was. After he showed the neighbor's telescope to his neighbor, he said that it was probably just a light to lure children about. It is, according to ****** ******, who is well known in local FLTING circles as an avid, repudiated by ******, going to extremes to obtain publicity, ****** did not remain at the ****** but 3 few minutes after the object was ****** out to him and the three turns, and ****** to his company at the Fairview clubs********l ***** ***** and *** the rooster on his brother's, ****** ****** lasted at long as he and ****** to verify the object men raising the **************.

Page 2                 Incident____290A (Cont'd)

Name and address of observer:      Mr.______ Charlotte,
                                               N. C.

Occupation and hobbies:            Painter

Comments of Interviewer relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

                                Appeared completely sincere

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Left the stadium after the show at approximately 2230. When he had walked several blocks from the stadium in a northerly direction on his way home he stopped and observed the sky to see if the object was still visible but could not locate it. The object did not move in any direction during all of the period that he observed it and he did not see it appear or disappear. Mr.____remarked that this is above observation impressed him as being about half the diameter and length of his "little finger" when observed at arms length and that he was of the opinion that it was possibly 20,000 feet in height but that it may be been only several thousand feet high as it was very difficult to estimate heights. He stated that for an amateur aeroplane pilot, that is required a student license and flew his plane over a period of several years during the past few years. He was not flown for approximately the last year and although he has logged approximately 75 hours flying time he never received a Private Pilots License. He was wearing his regular eye glasses at the time the above observation was made and stated that viewing this object "upset" him as he has never been able to decide what it was. After he showed this object to Mr.____ he remarked to Mr.____ that it was probably a mistake to have told him about it as, according to Mr._____, Mr.____ is well known in local flying circles as an avid "flying saucer" advocate, going to extremes to obtain publicity, ____ till did not remain at the stadium but a few minutes after the object was pointed out to him and Mr._____, who assumes the position of the Charlotte Observer to report the incident; as Mr. Dixon, reporter for the above paper, telephoned him at his home later in the evening to verify information given him by Mr._____. He estimated that the object was pointed out to____ approximately at 2130 and that he had observed it for less time than the time before leaving. He delivered a number of other persons standing near him in the stadium observed the object but that he does not know the identity of any of them except as mentioned above. He has never studied the heavens mystified by the above object and has never observed anything like it before. (End)
