There is one black and white photograph present on the document. It shows a paved two-lane road stretching through a rural area with open fields or grasslands on either side. There are no vehicles on the road, and it appears to be a sunny day with no obstructions in the sky. Trees and bushes can be seen sparsely dotted along the horizon, which is also where the road seems to converge due to the perspective.

The image features a black-and-white photograph positioned in the center of the document. The photograph appears to depict a rural landscape â€” a flat field, possibly a farmland or prairie, with a few small structures resembling barns or farmhouses dotting the landscape. There are fences visible, demarcating sections of land, and the terrain is relatively open with sparse vegetation. In the sky, there seems to be an object marked with an 'X' which could be the subject of interest in this UFO report. The environment suggests an expansive outdoor area under a clear sky.

The text on the document reads:
