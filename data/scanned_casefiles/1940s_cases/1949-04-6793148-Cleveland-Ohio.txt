NARRATIVE SUMMARY
AT CLEVELAND; OHIO

On 22 April 1949 and 5 May 1949, Mr. ------, Chief, Weather Bureau,
Administration Building, Cleveland Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, stated in
substance that at about 2300 hours on 6 April 1949, he was driving from Gladys
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, to his house at 16900 Truax Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio,
when he noticed 3 red objects about three to five miles high to the south by
southwest. It was about 45 degrees, had a swaying motion, and a translation in
northeasterly. From somewhere, the object appeared to be approximately 3 1/2
miles east arid equivalent to the 100 watt light in the AT&T Towal. The object
had no flame, trail, or odor and made no noise in the object traversed eastward,
moving very slowly, and was visible about 15 to 20 minutes. The object appeared
to be about 6-7000 feet high. There were no clouds and there had been clear
visibility from 2200 hours. The night before there was a strong meteor and the
night after this incident, the Northern Lights. ------ stated that at first he
thought it might have been a lantern on a balloon as a candle would burn port-
-antly if free air since a balloon would be moving with the wind. however, it
got slower,dimmer and then faded out completely. There is a projection or ceil-
ing light at the north by northeast edge of the airport which confuses some
people. This light is exactly 1176 feet from the Control Tower at the Airport
and projects a light straight up and shines into the clouds. Some observes
think the beam of light is moving when the clouds pass through the beam and
get the mistaken idea that this is a "Flying saucer". Mr. ------ marked the
course that was taken from Gladys Avenue to Truax Avenue, Cleveland, and the
approximate location of the object. (See Inclosure 1, Local Aeronautical Chart).
Mr. ----- also furnished copies of the official weather report for 5, 6, and
7 April 1949 (See Inclosure 2).

COPY 4/P

(SUPERMAN MAYBE??)

THERE’S A SAMPLE OF A CONVERSATION ON ANY STREET CORNER IN
CLEVELAND TODAY:

“WHAT WAS THAT IN THE SKY LAST NIGHT—A BIRD, A PLANE—
SUPERMAN?

AND THE ANSWER, LIKE AS NOT IS—“IT LOOKED LIKE A STRANGE,
GLOWING RED LIGHT TO ME.”

AND THERE YOU HAVE THE BIG QUESTION IN CLEVELAND TODAY,
JUST WHAT WAS IT MANY CLEVELANDERS SAW IN THE SKY LAST NIGHT.
AN AIRPORT OFFICIAL SAYS IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING HE'S EVER
SEEN. THERE WERE NO JET PLANES IN THE AREA LAST NIGHT. AND
THERE WAS THIS RED LIGHT—SOMETIMES WHIPPING AT HIGH SPEED...
SOMETIMES HOVERING IN ONE SPOT.

ONE THING CERTAIN—IT WASN’T A FLYING SAUCER. THEY WERE
SEEN ONLY IN THE DAYTIME LAST YEAR. AND SPEAKING OF THEM....
THE AIR FORCE SAID TODAY IT STILL CAN’T EXPLAIN THE SAUCERS.
THE AIR FORCE SAYS THERE’S NO REASON TO THINK SOME FOREIGN
COUNTRY WAS PRACTICING WITH ROCKETS OVER AMERICAN TERRITORY.
YET ON THE OTHER HAND, THE AIR FORCE SAYS CAUTIOUSLY THAT IT
CAN’T RULE OUT THAT POSSIBILITY. JUST WHAT WERE THEY? LIKE
CLEVELANDERS TODAY, THE AIR FORCE JUST SHRUGS ITS COLLECTIVE
SHOULDER AND SAYS "YOU TELL ME.”

5D 21-21D
PROJECT GRUDGE

DETAILS:

1. Investigation is predicated on receipt of a Routing and Record Sheet
dated 12 April 1949 from Technical Intelligence Division (MCIAAS), Hq Air
Material Command, to investigate the sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena
at Cleveland, Ohio, on 6 April 1949.

AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE

2. The files of this office reveal the following United Press release
dated Cleveland, Ohio, 7 April 1949:

"The latest thing in flying saucers has been reported in Cleveland.
This time it's described as a strange, glowing red light in the sky that moves
with great speed, then seems to hover in one spot. Several west-side Cleve-
landers said they saw it between 11 and 11:30 last night in the eastern sky.

"Two men at the airport control tower also saw it. One watched it
through binoculars but couldn't make out what it was. One of the two,
CHESTER BOZTUK (correct?), called it 'the weirdest phenomena he's ever seen.
It'll never go of those oneills we ran into the one born forty at Case
Institute. Between 11 oclock and 11.20, all of them from west siders. Looked
didn't see anything unusual.

"(Supernaturabe?) Here's a sample of conversation on any street
corner in Cleveland today: 'What was that in the sky last night...a bird, a
plane...superman and the answer, like so not is...!' It looked like a strange,
glowing red light to me.'

"And there you have the big question in Cleveland today. Just what
was it many Clevelanders saw in the sky last night. An airport official says
it was the 'weirdest thing he's ever seen. There're no jet planes in the area
last night. Yet this was this red light...sometimes whipping at high speed...
sometimes hovering in one spot.

"No thing ordinary...It wasn't a flying saucer. They were seen only
in the daytime last year. And speaking of them...the Air Force said today
it still can't explain the saucers. The Air Force says there's no reason to
think some foreign country was practicing with rockets over American territory.
Yet on the other hand, the Air Froce says cautiously that it can't rule out that
possibility. Just what were they? Like Clevelanders today, the Air Force just
shrugs its collective shoulders and says, 'You tell me,' !

tried to establish radio contact and also green light contact with negative
results. Thinking perhaps it could be a reflection, contact opened the window
and from the tower, the object appeared to be approximately one foot in dia-
meter and not moving either laterally or horizontally. Finally, at 2303 hours,
it just disappeared very gradually, like turning over a page. It appeared to
be from 10 to 15,000 feet high, with no sound or trail, no jets or other
clouds, and remained a bright red light on an azimuth, however, there was
no movement to this light. [REDACTED] stated that he later checked Flight Service,
Satellite Field, Mitchel, and inquired about this phenomenon but they told him
that he would have to go through proper channels. [REDACTED] didn't belive [sic]
could have been a helicopter or balloon because the light stayed at the same
level all the time that it was visible. It seemed more like the nose lights
of a Constellation aircraft, however, a light of this type would have to be
coming straight toward a person to have the appearance of not moving and in 4
or 5 minutes it would have passed out of sight completely. [REDACTED] does not
wear glasses.

Note: Redactions were present in the original text, and I have indicated these with [REDACTED]. There may have been errors in the document such as "stated substance" and "rod bail," which perhaps should read "stated in substance" and "rod ball." Similarly "belive" appears to be a typographical error for "believe."

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 28 April 1949, Mr. --------- CAA, Cleveland Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, stated in substance that on the night of 5 April 1949, he was visiting Mr. ---------, not the Control Tower, Cleveland Municipal airport and at about 2235 he noticed a red object in the air. After calling ------ and a Mr. -------'s attention to the light and watching it for a couple of minutes, they noticed that the lights hadn't moved. He also viewed the lights through an impersonation glass. After watching the lights through the window, ------------- went outside and it still had the same brightness to the naked eye. It appeared to be a large red object about 2 to 3 feet in diameter. It was a bright clear night and there was nothing to visually compare it with. It appeared to be about 15,000 feet above the tower, 30-40 degrees from the ground and approximately north by northwest of the Control Tower. The light looked perfectly round and had off-shoots like a person would notice in an eclipse of the moon. The light was steady, did not appear to move and faded out suddenly at about 2303 hours. A light similar to this was seen the following night by the control tower operators. The control tower could not make contact with the object. The object had no sound or odor, ------------- stated that he thought it could have been a meteor, balloon, jet exhaust, autogyro, or dirigible, but any of these would have moved in the total time visible. --------- does not wear glasses.

1. This phase of the investigation was conducted by Special Agents GEORGE
SIMPSON and ROBERT F. DENISON.

AT CLEVELAND, OHIO

2. On 22 April 1949 and 6 May 1949, Mr. -------, Close:
Claims Administrator Building, Cleveland Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio,
stated in substance that at about 2300 hours on 6 April, 1949, he was driving
from Garfield Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, to his home at ------------, Cleveland,
Ohio, when he noticed a red object about three to five miles high to the south
by southwest. It was about 45 degrees, had a swaying motion, and a variation
in brilliancy. From his home, the object appeared to be approximately 1 1/2
miles east southeast to the 1000 lights in the WAL TOWER. The object
had no flame, trail, or odor and made no noise. The object traveled eastward,
moving very slowly, and was visible about 15 to 20 minutes. The object appeared
to be about 6-7000 feet high. There were no clouds and there had been clear
visibility from 2200 hours. The night before there was some meteor outside night
after this incident, the lights on a balloon used as a studio twist at first thought
it might have been a balloon from Lakehurst. The studio twist was, it lay on
its side with no ballasted outward. On coming in on the balloon, the gadgetry
dimmer and on faded out completely. There is a projection or ceiling light
at the north by northeast edge of the airport which juts over some pipes. This
light is exactly 1176 feet from the Control Tower at the Airport and projects
a light streaming up and shines into the clouds. Some observers think the beam
of this light is what reflects causes this U-shaped glare and the whole was a
U-shape, this shows a triangular vapour arms to the shine and was taken
from Cloady Avenue to Murray Avenue, Cleveland, and the approximate location of 
the object. (See Thomas L. ____, Local Representative) Mr. ____ also enclosed
furnished copies of the official weather report for 5, 6, and 7 April 1949. (See
Inclosure 20)

3. On 22 April 1949, Mr. ________, Senior Controller, Air Traffic
Control, Cleveland Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, stated in an interview
that on the night of 5 April 1949, Mr. CAA, had come up in the
control tower for a visit. Looking to the north, they noticed a light that
looked like a passing or navigation light of a P-11, far enough and high enough
that the two lights would blend together. It appeared to be a passing light
because when they are not directly in front of you, they change intensity
from bright to dull red almost like winking its for short, and steady when
All last did not move). This later statement is for believing that it might be
a position so they opened the window and it still didn't work. They then
observed the light through binoculars with a 7x50 lens. It looked like a
blinking round ball, rather like two bright red lights from about 2255 to 2303
when it dimmed out just like turning a kerosene light out.
                                                                                        continued

DETAILS: CLEVELAND, OHIO

1. I, XXXXXXXXX, Aviation Safety Agent, Department of Com-
merce, Civil Aeronautics Administration, Office of Aviation Safety, Munici-
pal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, submit as follows:

On March 8, 1949 approximately 1415 while enroute from Toledo, Ohio to
Cleveland, Ohio, via aircraft, I had an unusual incident occur.

When approximately four miles west of Vermilion, Ohio over the lakeshore at
2500 feet in altitude, an object was suddenly observed approaching head-on
at the same altitude. I immediately pulled up into a steep climb to
avoid a collision and continued to turn to the right to observe the object
which I had nearly collided but very much to my amazement, I was unable
to locate anything, while so doing suddenly and spectacularly a polished
shining object flashed into the sunbeam naturally severely blinded my 
vision for a few seconds. This object was approximately 500 feet above me
altitude so I finally dived 90o away not to be collided into the cloud.

My first impression was that I had nearly collided with a reversed model air-
plane but after giving it long thoughts, I realized that its wings were not
the fixed-on type of the fuselage was too large to be that of a model since
it was very near and compared to be having a 10-inch wingspan and as the
sun beamed on its sides, it was very near and to be containing no less than 
and supposed to measure not 39 inches from tip to tip, none of the following
of a model was painted red. Wings were mounted in the center of the fuselage or
six to eight feet and appeared to be about three feet long or a total span of
six to eight feet and were polished light gray.

After landing at Cleveland, Ohio, I discussed this incident with a few close 
friends and last ditchwater drop as it was so fantastic, but after careful
consideration, I now think this information should be on record.

As a matter of information, I have been flying for twenty years with approxi-
mately 5900 hours and hold an Airline Transport Pilots Rating Certificate with
all ratings. The foregoing is not the result of a vivid imagination but an
explanation of the facts to the best of my knowledge."

results. Thinking perhaps it could be a refloeion, completely opened the window 
and still the object was as clear as ever. He believes it was approximately 25,200 feet in diam-
eter and not moving. The object appeared to be approximately one foot in diam-
eter from snout to inner circle! Vertically. Of horizontally. orless, and 8500 miles, 
to be from 10 to 15,000 feet high, with no sound or trail, no effects on the 
clouds, ard resembled a bright red lights as on an aircraft, however, therp was 
no movement to the light. it stated that his later checked Flight Service, 
Selfridge Field, Michigan, and inquired about the phenomenon but they told him 
that he would have to go through proper channels. The informant didn't believe it 
could have been a helicopter or balloon because the light stayed at st same 
level all the time last it was visible. It seemed more like a hose lights of 
a Consolidated Aircraft, however, a light of this type would have to be coming 
straight toward a person to where a person's eyes were not ilnating and in other 
terms, it would have passed out of sight completely. XXX and XXX does not wear

airman's winning tower's vision glasses. After watching the lights to view the 
lights, XXXX an attempt made and it still had the same brightness to the naked 
eye. It appeared to be a large red object about 2 to 3 feet in diameter. 
It was a bright clear night and there was nothing to normally compare it with.
It appeared to be about 15,000 feet high, 30-40 degrees from five ground and 
approximately north by northwest ot the Control Tower. The light looked per-
fectly round and had reflections like a person would notice in an eclipse of 
the moon. The light was steady, did not appear to move and faded out suddenly 
at about 2305 hours. A light similar to this was seen the following night 
by the control tower operators. The control tower could not make contact with 
the object. The object had no sound or odor. XXXX stated that he thought 
it could have been a meteor, balloon, jet exhaust, autogyro, or dirigible,
but any of these would have moved in the total time visible. XXXX does not 
wear glasses.

7. A check of the local investigative agencies in the Cleveland Area Failed 
to produce any information regarding the Aerial Phenomena.

8. It was learned during the course of this investigation that the closest
radar station is at Columbus, Ohio.

An attempt was made to contact the object with regative results. At first, it was believed to be a helicopter but a helicopter couldn't maintain such a steady position. ***** stated that he had had previous experience in sighting balloon lights but saw none that he could honestly say had no balloons. ******** tells us that balloons usually change within. This light was a deep red light as an aircraft light. There was no evidence of a twinkle, or do or sound from the object. There was practically unrestricted visibility with no cloud illumination. ***** stated that he also considered the possibility that the light had been a star but dismissed this also because stars including orange in color. Also, he stated that a plane could not maintain steady position like these objects and fading away would be much more gradual.

It might have been a balloon but that was practically impossible as there was no wind and when the winds were checked it was found that they were moving in a normal circle at about 10 to 12 miles per hour.

5. On 23 April 1949, Mr. **** **** **** ****, Control Tower Operator, Cleveland, Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, stated in substance that at about 2255 hours on 5 April 1949, he saw a red light which seemed like a red ball about two south of the control tower, roughly about 10 to 15 miles away at about 25 to 30 degrees from the ground. Occasionally, lights are crafts come in over field with red antic and he thought this is one of these.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY: 
On 22 April 1949, Mr. ---------------, Senior Controller, Air Traffic
Control, Cleveland Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, stated in an interview
that on the night of 5 April 1949, Mr. --------------- CAA, had come up in the
control tower for a visit. Looking to the north, they noticed a light that
looked like a passing or navigation light of a P-51, far enough and high enough
that the two lights would blend together. It appeared to be a passing light
because when they are not directly in front of you, they change instantly
from bright red to dull red. After watching it for awhile, --------------- stated that
the lights didn't move. This led --------------- to believe that it might be
a reflection so they opened the windows and it still didn't move. They then
observed the light through binoculars with a 7x50 lens. It looked like a
white round ball, rather flickery. It was visible from about 2255 to 2303
then it dimmed out just like turning a kerosene light out. --------------- contacted
United Airlines Radio and asked them to change their No. 25 Flight over to
this frequency. --------------- stated the plane was by this time, the plane was 
over Elyria, Ohio, and the pilot stated that it could not be had no mean 
anything unusual. --------------- stated that the lights appeared and 8 to 10 smoles
away, 12,000 feet above sea level, and due north of the tower at about 30 
degrees from the ground. An attempt was made to contact the object with nega-
tive results. At first, it was believed to be a helicopter but a helicopter 
couldn't make in such a steady position. It was stated that he had previously
experience in helping track down balloons but hasn't seen a balloon that 
steady and besides, a balloon light is usually orange white. This, however,
was a deep red light as an aircraft light. There was no evidence of a trail,
odor, or sound from the object. There was practically unrestricted visibility
with no cloud illumination. --------------- stated that he also considered the possi-
bility of the light being a star but dispensed with this idea because stars are 
blue in color. Also, it stated that a plane could not maintain a steady posi-
tion like this object and the fading away would be much more gradual. The wind 
was steady at about 10 to 15 miles from the southwest; --------------- not near
glasses.
