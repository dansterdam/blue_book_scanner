NARRATIVE SUMMARY
AT CLEVELAND; OHIO

On 22 April 1949 and 5 May 1949, Mr. ------, Chief, Weather Bureau,
Administration Building, Cleveland Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, stated in
substance that at about 2300 hours on 6 April 1949, he was driving from Gladys
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, to his house at 16900 Truax Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio,
when he noticed 3 red objects about three to five miles high to the south by
southwest. It was about 45 degrees, had a swaying motion, and a translation in
northeasterly. From somewhere, the object appeared to be approximately 3 1/2
miles east arid equivalent to the 100 watt light in the AT&T Towal. The object
had no flame, trail, or odor and made no noise in the object traversed eastward,
moving very slowly, and was visible about 15 to 20 minutes. The object appeared
to be about 6-7000 feet high. There were no clouds and there had been clear
visibility from 2200 hours. The night before there was a strong meteor and the
night after this incident, the Northern Lights. ------ stated that at first he
thought it might have been a lantern on a balloon as a candle would burn port-
-antly if free air since a balloon would be moving with the wind. however, it
got slower,dimmer and then faded out completely. There is a projection or ceil-
ing light at the north by northeast edge of the airport which confuses some
people. This light is exactly 1176 feet from the Control Tower at the Airport
and projects a light straight up and shines into the clouds. Some observes
think the beam of light is moving when the clouds pass through the beam and
get the mistaken idea that this is a "Flying saucer". Mr. ------ marked the
course that was taken from Gladys Avenue to Truax Avenue, Cleveland, and the
approximate location of the object. (See Inclosure 1, Local Aeronautical Chart).
Mr. ----- also furnished copies of the official weather report for 5, 6, and
7 April 1949 (See Inclosure 2).

COPY 4/P

(SUPERMAN MAYBE??)

THERE’S A SAMPLE OF A CONVERSATION ON ANY STREET CORNER IN
CLEVELAND TODAY:

“WHAT WAS THAT IN THE SKY LAST NIGHT—A BIRD, A PLANE—
SUPERMAN?

AND THE ANSWER, LIKE AS NOT IS—“IT LOOKED LIKE A STRANGE,
GLOWING RED LIGHT TO ME.”

AND THERE YOU HAVE THE BIG QUESTION IN CLEVELAND TODAY,
JUST WHAT WAS IT MANY CLEVELANDERS SAW IN THE SKY LAST NIGHT.
AN AIRPORT OFFICIAL SAYS IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING HE'S EVER
SEEN. THERE WERE NO JET PLANES IN THE AREA LAST NIGHT. AND
THERE WAS THIS RED LIGHT—SOMETIMES WHIPPING AT HIGH SPEED...
SOMETIMES HOVERING IN ONE SPOT.

ONE THING CERTAIN—IT WASN’T A FLYING SAUCER. THEY WERE
SEEN ONLY IN THE DAYTIME LAST YEAR. AND SPEAKING OF THEM....
THE AIR FORCE SAID TODAY IT STILL CAN’T EXPLAIN THE SAUCERS.
THE AIR FORCE SAYS THERE’S NO REASON TO THINK SOME FOREIGN
COUNTRY WAS PRACTICING WITH ROCKETS OVER AMERICAN TERRITORY.
YET ON THE OTHER HAND, THE AIR FORCE SAYS CAUTIOUSLY THAT IT
CAN’T RULE OUT THAT POSSIBILITY. JUST WHAT WERE THEY? LIKE
CLEVELANDERS TODAY, THE AIR FORCE JUST SHRUGS ITS COLLECTIVE
SHOULDER AND SAYS "YOU TELL ME.”

5D 21-21D
PROJECT GRUDGE

DETAILS:

1. Investigation is predicated on receipt of a Routing and Record Sheet
dated 12 April 1949 from Technical Intelligence Division (MCIAAS), Hq Air
Material Command, to investigate the sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena
at Cleveland, Ohio, on 6 April 1949.

AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE

2. The files of this office reveal the following United Press release
dated Cleveland, Ohio, 7 April 1949:

"The latest thing in flying saucers has been reported in Cleveland.
This time it's described as a strange, glowing red light in the sky that moves
with great speed, then seems to hover in one spot. Several west-side Cleve-
landers said they saw it between 11 and 11:30 last night in the eastern sky.

"Two men at the airport control tower also saw it. One watched it
through binoculars but couldn't make out what it was. One of the two,
CHESTER BOZTUK (correct?), called it 'the weirdest phenomena he's ever seen.
It'll never go of those oneills we ran into the one born forty at Case
Institute. Between 11 oclock and 11.20, all of them from west siders. Looked
didn't see anything unusual.

"(Supernaturabe?) Here's a sample of conversation on any street
corner in Cleveland today: 'What was that in the sky last night...a bird, a
plane...superman and the answer, like so not is...!' It looked like a strange,
glowing red light to me.'

"And there you have the big question in Cleveland today. Just what
was it many Clevelanders saw in the sky last night. An airport official says
it was the 'weirdest thing he's ever seen. There're no jet planes in the area
last night. Yet this was this red light...sometimes whipping at high speed...
sometimes hovering in one spot.

"No thing ordinary...It wasn't a flying saucer. They were seen only
in the daytime last year. And speaking of them...the Air Force said today
it still can't explain the saucers. The Air Force says there's no reason to
think some foreign country was practicing with rockets over American territory.
Yet on the other hand, the Air Froce says cautiously that it can't rule out that
possibility. Just what were they? Like Clevelanders today, the Air Force just
shrugs its collective shoulders and says, 'You tell me,' !

to 30 degrees from the ground. Occasionally, lights aircraft comes over the
field without radio and he thought that it might be one of these. He
tried to establish radio contact and also green light contact with negative
results. Thinking perhaps it could be a reflection, contact opened the window
and from the tower, the object appeared to be approximately one foot in dia-
meter and not moving either laterally or horizontally. Finally, at 2303 hours,
it just disappeared very gradually, like turning over a page. It appeared to
be from 10 to 15,000 feet high, with no sound or trail, no jets or other
clouds, and remained a bright red light on an azimuth, however, there was
no movement to this light. [REDACTED] stated that he later checked Flight Service,
Satellite Field, Mitchel, and inquired about this phenomenon but they told him
that he would have to go through proper channels. [REDACTED] didn't belive [sic]
could have been a helicopter or balloon because the light stayed at the same
level all the time that it was visible. It seemed more like the nose lights
of a Constellation aircraft, however, a light of this type would have to be
coming straight toward a person to have the appearance of not moving and in 4
or 5 minutes it would have passed out of sight completely. [REDACTED] does not
wear glasses.

Note: Redactions were present in the original text, and I have indicated these with [REDACTED]. There may have been errors in the document such as "stated substance" and "rod bail," which perhaps should read "stated in substance" and "rod ball." Similarly "belive" appears to be a typographical error for "believe."

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 28 April 1949, Mr. --------- CAA, Cleveland Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, stated in substance that on the night of 5 April 1949, he was visiting Mr. ---------, not the Control Tower, Cleveland Municipal airport and at about 2235 he noticed a red object in the air. After calling ------ and a Mr. -------'s attention to the light and watching it for a couple of minutes, they noticed that the lights hadn't moved. He also viewed the lights through an impersonation glass. After watching the lights through the window, ------------- went outside and it still had the same brightness to the naked eye. It appeared to be a large red object about 2 to 3 feet in diameter. It was a bright clear night and there was nothing to visually compare it with. It appeared to be about 15,000 feet above the tower, 30-40 degrees from the ground and approximately north by northwest of the Control Tower. The light looked perfectly round and had off-shoots like a person would notice in an eclipse of the moon. The light was steady, did not appear to move and faded out suddenly at about 2303 hours. A light similar to this was seen the following night by the control tower operators. The control tower could not make contact with the object. The object had no sound or odor, ------------- stated that he thought it could have been a meteor, balloon, jet exhaust, autogyro, or dirigible, but any of these would have moved in the total time visible. --------- does not wear glasses.
