SUBJECT: Report of Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft

TO: Hq, Third Army, att. AC of S, G-2

1. The following report submitted in accordance with ltr.,
Third Army, AGAC-452.1 General, 1 April 1948. The undersigned
warned of a sighting of an unconventional aircraft, investigated,
and submits herewith the following information:
  
  a. Sighted at Belmont, N. C., March 3, 1948 at 1100 hours.
  
  b. Weather clear, visibility excellent, few small scattered
     fleecy white clouds.

2. Witnesses:
  Mr. John Doe, Supt., Meter Dept.,
  Duke Power Co., Charlotte, N. C.
  Mr. ----, Asst. to above.
  Mr. ----, Gastonia Electric Co.,
  Gastonia, N. C.

d. No photographs.

3. Object sighted:

  (1) One
  (2) Round-not able to determine whether disc or sphere.
  (3) Size-not able to estimate except that apparent size
     from ground about that of small coin.
  (4) Color-bright or silver, reflected sunlight, but no
     flicker, steady reflection.
  (5) Speed-estimated a bit faster than Jet type airplane,
     that witness has seen, or about 500 miles per hour.
     Witness was able to observe very fast speed in
     relation to a small cloud, behind which object
     disappeared. Seen for about 10 seconds.
  (6) Heading-easterly.
  (7) Maneuverability-object moved in straight line at
     constant speed without apparent change in altitude
     or direction.

There are no photographs present in this document. The document appears to be a typed report. Here is the text transcribed from the document:

---

2. The undersigned talked to Mr. --------, but neither of
the other witnesses. Mr. --------is a man of excellent character and
education, a first grade engineer, and employee of Duke Power Co. for
some 30 years. He is known to the undersigned thru mutual close friend 
to whom he is related, i.e. impressed the undersigned as being conservative
and someone who is talked to with a very technical and responsible
position. Was employed by the government during war in some work of
a technical and classified nature.

Mr. -------- was careful in his statements outlined above. He
does not claim that he and other witnesses saw a "flying disc".
Humorously claims that they saw an object with they could not
identify with any natural phenomenon or known type of aircraft.
Was quite sure in his own mind that it did not resemble any
conventional aircraft, that it was "a round metallic appearing
object, moving very rapidly." He states that there is absolutely
no doubt in his mind or that of the other two witnesses that they
saw something very clearly of the above description, and that they
all watched it for some ten seconds until it disappeared behind
a small cloud.

3. If -------- states that he will be glad to give any
further information that may be desired, but believes the above
contains all the information which he can give as to the object
itself. Was exact location from which the witnesses sighted the
object can be obtained as the three were working on a power line
at the time and have a detailed diagram of their exact position.

4. Further information concerning Mr. -------- and the other
witness could not be obtained from the Personnel Dept of
Duke Power Co. The undersigned knows nothing about the references
of the third witness, Mr. --------.

5. The undersigned has no further information upon which
to evaluate report, but from talking to Mr. -------- feels that
he and other witnesses saw something which they could not identify,
are sincere, and the details of the object in their own minds are
as presented above. Mr. --------repeated that he was quite
positive that the object was not an airplane.

Dear Colonel Stayner:

Reference is made to your letter, subject: "Report of Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft" to HQ, Third Army, attn AC of S, G-2, dated 15 April 1948.

It is requested that an estimate of the height of the clouds at
1100 hours on 8 March 1948 be secured from the Belmont, N. C. Weather Bureau. It is further requested that Mr. ______ be interviewed once more for the purpose of securing the following:

a. An estimation, of the horizontal or slant range from his
position to the object.

b. Whether or not the object gave the appearance of immense—
size at great height or that of medium size at a lesser altitude.

c. In the event the object did give the appearance of
great size, are there any other known observers not in the immediate vicinity of the aircraft and its occupants?

Any further information available on this or other sightings of
this nature would be greatly appreciated by this Headquarters.

Sincerely yours,

UNCLASSIFIED

May, 7, 1948

Commanding General
Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
Attn: MCI A

Gentlemen,

Reference is made to your letter of 21 April to me from
Col. W. R. Clingerman (signed by Lt. Col. J. J. Hausman)
In reply to my report of 15 April, subject: "Sighting of
Unconventional Aircraft."

The weather bureau at Morris Field (about five miles from
the Imperial Cotton Mills, Belmont, N. C. - where object was
sighted) reports that the weather on 8 March 1948 at 1100 hrs.
as unlimited ceiling, clouds about 1' high (above 10,000 ft.)
thin Stratus, estimated at 30,000 ft all over Morris Field
says that these conditions were general 130 hrs. more s, 'end
undoubtedly the same over the sighting spot as they were at the
weather station at Morris Field.

Have interviewed the witness, Mr. ——— again and he
says that since he is not a trained aerial observer and does
not know either the actual size of the object or the distance
could be unable to estimate horizontal or range, I
determine whether the object appeared to be large at a great
distance, or smaller at a lesser distance. There are no other
known observers other than Mr. ——— and his party.

Mr. ——— has added nothing further to the original report,
except that he seems to be of the impression that the object
was a disc rather than a sphere, but I don't see how he could
determine this under the conditions, and since he was uncertain
in his original report, believe it should probably be discounted.
He was quite insistent that he heard no sound, and that it wasn't
in his opinion a conventional type airplane.

It is regretted that no more information is available.

Yours very truly,
James V. Rogers, Jr.
Lt. Col. Vmi U C (Res)

RESTRICTED
UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #205 -- Belmont, North Carolina -- 8 March 1948

The speed of 600 M.P.H., the lack of an exhaust trail, and 
the reported "exactly horizontal course" make it extremely improba-
ble that the object seen in this incident was a meteor. The 
"steady red light which did not flicker" also argues against that
possibility. Since the observer was a technical man, it does not
seem likely that his observations can be considered subjective
enough to fit them into an astronomical hypothesis.

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sighting of unidentified flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries l thru 172 from the files of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendations as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Army Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The unsummarized tabulated may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are checked by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks are usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, MCIAO-3. The synoptic radio-meteorograms that you supply balloons' flight paths by weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce, (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

A round metallic-appearing object moving very rapidly at an estimated 
speed of 600 MPH was observed near Belmont, N.C. at approximately 1100 
the morning of 8 Mar 48. The weather was clear with almost unlimited 
with a few small scattered fleecy white clouds. It could not 
be determined if the object were a disc or sphere. Its apparent size was 
that of a small coin of a bright or silver color. It reflected the sun 
maintaining a steady reflection which did not flicker. The object which 
was under observation for about 10 seconds was on an easterly heading and 
moved in a straight line at a constant speed without apparent change in 
altitude or direction. It was impossible to determine the altitude but 
it was moving above the clouds. No sound of any kind was heard nor was 
any exhaust trail observed.

NOTE: Witness (name) is a man of excellent character and reputation 
a first-grade engineer and an employee of Duke Power Co for some 30 to 
years. He impressed the agent as being conservative and sound 
and is a technical man with a very technical and reasonable position.

Mr. (name) was correct in his statement. He does not claim 
he saw the "flying disc" merely acknowledging that they saw 
an object which they could not identify with any natural phenomenon 
or known type of aircraft. It's "rounded" & round ball 
appearing object moving very rapidly.
