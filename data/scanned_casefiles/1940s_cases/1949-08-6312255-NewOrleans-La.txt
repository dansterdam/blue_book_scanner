8. PHOTOS : No.

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE:

10. CONCLUSION: Other (Cast Aluminum Alloy of Ordinary Commercial Quality)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS : 

No one actually saw the object with the ground. Several persons came to the object only after it had a hard landing. The object is pie-shaped of a cast aluminum alloy of ordinary commercial quality. The exterior was covered by a sooty substance. The underneath the metal is of a silver grey color. The rim edges of the objects are rough, indicating that the metal may have been cut from a larger piece. The rounded edge of the object is apparently a finished edge. The object varies in thickness from 1/8 to 1/2".

This is all the observable text on the provided page of the document.

The photograph shows an ambiguous black and white image that resembles a smudged vertical shape with slightly curved edges on the right side. It is not entirely clear what the object is, due to the quality of the image and the lack of distinct features. Below the image is a ruler measuring the width of the object displayed. The ruler in the image shows measurements from 6 inches to 11 inches, indicating the object is slightly wider than 3 inches.

The text in the document is as follows:

"UNCLASSIFIED"

Both occurrences of the word "UNCLASSIFIED" are in all caps with one instance at the top right corner of the page and the other at the bottom right corner near the ruler. There also appears to be a faint, redacted or blotched out text at the top left corner, which is unreadable due to its quality.

- page 2 -

The photograph shows an elongated, vertical object that appears to be solid and slightly blurry, against a plain background. It looks like a common representation of a fast-moving object in the sky, usually described as a possible UFO or other unexplained aerial phenomenon. There is a ruler placed at the bottom for scale, which ranges from 6 inches to 10 inches, indicating that the object depicted in the image might be considered in comparison to this scale. 

The text in the document is not fully legible due to the quality of the image, but the visible parts appear to be as follows:

- The word "CONFIDENTIAL" is visible in the top left corner.
- The word "UNCL" is visible in the top-right corner, which could be part of the word "UNCLASSIFIED."
- The word "UNCLASSIFIED" is clearly visible at the bottom center of the page, underneath the ruler.

Please note that the image is not clear, and the interpretation of some parts of the text may not be accurate.

- page 3 -

The photograph shows what appears to be a smudged or streaked image, possibly of a light or bright object against a dark background. The object is elongated and slightly curved, with irregular shapes protruding from its edges. The bottom part of the image shows a ruler for scale, indicating the object's size in comparison to inches. The ruler measures from 6 inches to 10 inches.

The visible text on the document reads:

- In the top right corner, obscured text with the visible part reading "... ASSIFIED"
- Above the object, text partly obscured seems to read "JNN A...SSIFIE D"
- At the bottom, under the ruler, the text reads "NOT DECLASS"
- On the lower right-hand side, "UNCLASSIFIED"

- page 4 -

The image shows a very grainy and low-quality photograph or reproduction of an object with an irregular, somewhat elliptical shape. There are some dark spots or irregularities on the surface. The photo is predominantly white with a dark, uneven outline. It is not clear what the object is from this image alone.

The text in the document states:

"UNCLASSIFIED" at the top right and "UNCLASSIFIED" at the bottom right of the page. There appears to be some other text or markings below "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top right, but it is not readable.

- page 5 -

The image shows a black and white photocopy of a page with a roughly oval-shaped object that appears to be hand-drawn or a very grainy photograph. There are no discernible details within the oval shape that would allow for a more precise description.

Text on the document reads:
- "CONFIDENTIAL" is stamped diagonally across the lower left part of the image.
- "UNCLASSIFIED" is stamped on the bottom right, and also near the top right of the page, denoting that the document's classification has likely changed from confidential to unclassified.

- page 6 -

The image appears to be a black and white photocopy or scan of a document, and it is difficult to discern any clear photographs or detailed subjects due to the poor quality and high contrast. However, the visible shapes do not appear to represent a traditional photograph; instead, they resemble irregular patterns or possible noise associated with the photocopying process itself.

Here is the text present in the document:

It includes the words "CONFIDENTIAL" at the top left and "UNCLASSIFIED" crossed out at the top right. There is a black bar at the bottom with "UNCLASSIFIED" clearly visible. The rest of the text or markings on the page are not legible due to the poor quality and high contrast of the image.

1. The submitted sample was a cast aluminum alloy of ordinary commercial quality. It was a sand casting, and probably made from a material equivalent to Alooa 13 alloy. Microscopic investigation revealed the casting to have a considerable amount of scattered porosity. The outer layers of grains were partially recrystallized indicating that the part was subject to fairly high temperatures at its surface.

2. A deposit which appeared to be grayish black covered both surfaces of the sample. The deposit on one side was in levels as could occur if hot "smoke" gases passed over it at high speeds. The deposit was gray in color when separated and powdered. X-ray diffraction methods revealed that it contained one crystalline material, CaCO3, while spectrographic tests indicated that the metallic elements in the deposit were principally Ca, with major amounts of Al, Si and Mg. Corrosion spots were present at scattered places on the surface.

3. An approximate spectrographic analysis of the base material of the casting was made. The elements found, including all the trace elements, were:

SYNOPSIS

On 13 August 1949, at approximately 2145 hours, a metal object
allegedly fell to the pavement at the intersection of Canal and
Bourbon Streets in New Orleans, Louisiana. This object is pie-shaped
apparently of metal alloy construction. The exterior is covered with
a sooty substance while underneath the metal is of a silvery-gray
color. Two (2) sides of the object are rough, indicating that the
metal may have been broken from a larger piece. The rounded edge of
the object is apparently a finished edge. The object varies in
thickness from approximately one-sixteenths inch (1/16") to one-
half inch (1/2"). Witnesses to this incident were Patrolman
                           of the New Orleans city Police, Mr. 
                           for the Illinois Central Railroad, and Mr.
                           for the vendor. Buildings in the vicinity of
alleged incident were examined with negative results to determine
if the object fell from a building.

DETAILS:

AT NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA:

1. On 15 August 1949, Mr. ████████ revealed that he was on duty for the New Orleans Police Department at approximately 2145 hours, on 13 August 1949, at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon Streets. At this time, Mr. ████████ heard a sharp explosion and after a lapse of five (5) minutes, a whirring sound which ended in the clattering of a piece of metal to the pavement approximately ten feet (10') from where Mr. ████████ was standing. Mr. ████████ did not observe the object until it had struck the pavement, at which time he took the object into custody, and also the name of one (1) witness, a Mr. ████████ residing to Mr. ████████ Street. According to Mr. ████████ there was no evidence of exhaust or any odor connected with the object. Mr. ████████ described the whirring noise which he heard as similar to a ventilator. Mr. ████████ checked buildings in the immediate vicinity to ascertain if the object could have fallen from one (1) of these buildings, but there was no evidence of such.

Mr. ████████ turned this object over to OSI Agents and the object is now in the custody of 9th OSI headquarters, Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana.

2. Mr. ████████ of Mr. ████████ Street, ████████, revealed on 15 August 1949, that the Illinois Central Railroad, at approximately 2145 hours, he and his wife were sitting in their car parked at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon Streets. The automobile was parked approximately four (4) car lengths from the place of the impact of the object. Mr. ████████ did not observe the object in flight, but did go to the scene as soon as he heard the clatter of metal on the sidewalk and saw the crowd begin to gather. According to Mr. ████████, the first person who noted the object was a news vendor at the intersection who was identified as Mr. ████████ of ████████ Street. Mr. ████████ related that an unidentified cab driver had observed the incident and urged the news vendor to contact local newspapers and report the "flying disc." Mr. ████████ also stated that the policeman on duty at the intersection was not aware of the object until he was called to the scene by a member of the crowd which gathered. Mr. ████████ did not observe any smoke or fumes in the vicinity of the impact.

3. On 22 August 1949, Mr. ████████, the news vendor who had first street, identified himself as the news vendor who had first observed the object which struck the pavement on 13 August 1949. The object was approximately ten (10) to twenty (20) feet from the point of impact and the object which narrowly missed a pedestrian. The object came from the air in a south-southwesterly direction.

direction, although Mr. [redacted] had previously stated that he did not see the object until it had struck the pavement. A number of pedestrians were at the intersection at the time and a crowd soon gathered. Members of the crowd urged Mr. [redacted] to contact the newspaper and report the "flying disc" and a member of the crowd called a policeman to the scene. Mr. [redacted] could offer no further information relative to the object.

4. Buildings immediately adjacent to the area at which the object allegedly fell were examined by OSI Agents on 19 August 1949. It was impossible to locate a source of the object in any of the buildings inspected.

5. The object which was recovered by Patrolman [redacted] is a pie-shaped object apparently of a metal alloy construction. The exterior is covered with a sooty substance while underneath the metal is of a silvery-gray color. Two (2) sides of the object are rough, indicating that the metal may have been broken from a larger piece. The rounded edge of the object is apparently a finished edge. The object varies in thickness from approximately one-eighth inch (1/8") to one-half inch (1/2").

It should be noted that the only positive information indicating that the object came from the air was from Patrolman [redacted], which was reported in Paragraph 1 above. Contrary to Patrolman [redacted]'s statement, the two (2) additional witnesses reported that [redacted] was not aware of the object until he was called to the scene from his traffic duties after the discovery of the object. Mr. [redacted], news vendor, stated that he did not see the object until it had struck the pavement and later stated that it had fallen from the air.

ENCLOSURES:

FOR COMMANDING GENERAL, AIR MATERIEL COMMAND, WRIGHT PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, DAYTON, OHIO:

Two (2) each photographs, four (4) views of object.

The image appears to display a black and white photograph or reproduction of a long, slender, vertical object or anomaly against a plain background. The object seems to have a darker core or line running down its center and light shading surrounding it, illustrating a cylindrical or tubular shape that tapers slightly towards the top. A few irregular, possibly curved features or appendages can be seen protruding from the sides of the object. Below the object, there is a scale reference indicating size, with numbers visible from 6 to 10. This suggests that the photograph was taken with an intent to document the object along with a measurable context for size estimation.

The image includes markings in the top left corner labeled "CONFIDENTIAL" and the top right corner labeled "UNC" (most likely short for UNCLASSIFIED), indicating a change in classification status.

I'm sorry, but since the text appears to be part of a graphical representation or photograph on a document, I'm unable to perform OCR functions to extract the text. If there was any text in the form of machine-typed or handwritten annotations, I would then be able to attempt to transcribe them.

- page 14 -

The photograph appears to show a close-up view of an irregularly shaped object with various surface textures, spots, and blemishes. It resembles a lunar or terrestrial surface with craters. However, due to the lack of context and scale, it's hard to determine the exact nature of the object or landscape depicted.

The text in the document is as follows:

CONFIDENTIAL [INCLASIFIED]
"CONFIDENCIAL"

CONF SEM/ATI

UNCLASSIFIED
"DESCLASIFICADO"

(Note: The document seems to have "CONFIDENTIAL" and "UNCLASSIFIED" written in both English and what appears to be Spanish, though "INCLASIFIED" is a misspelling of "UNCLASSIFIED" in English. The appearance and quality of the text suggest it might be a stamp or overlay on the image.)

(Note: As an AI with text recognition capabilities, I base my response only on the representation of text within the provided image and the requested operation of acting as an OCR system.)
