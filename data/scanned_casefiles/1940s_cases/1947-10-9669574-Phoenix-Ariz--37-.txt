With all incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation.
The remainder is twelve only under the assumption that the civil defense
setup is as reliable and accurate, when reported, of civil and military
aircraft movements as they are considered when eliminated.

Included and additionally classified by Dr. McDonald are
cases at Alice Springs, Oround Arizona, and Robinwood Maryland (see
Appendix "G").
G. AAF Pilot Observations Locality (See Appendix
Time
Not considered.

H. Various Incidents unclassifiable, occurrence locations other than
United States. Flying objects to provide plausible explanations when
reports not otherwise explainable. Photo errors in identifications made,
mistakes result chiefly from inability to substansiate speed, distance, and
size.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in
the report, since incidents from radio return "around to time. specific
type of objects, or amoung of particuliars. Various new incidents
appear, often linking cases to a common type of object
probably not a "hoax" nor existance of object all or reported
thought to reliably.

Project's Estimate
C. Study of 1947 Evaluation Of Remaining Incidents

III AAF Evaluation of Remaining Reports

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix "I")
contain a few observations, 3/4 of which by attendants of the
aircraft time to time, in a wide geographical area of the U.S.
Incidents (relate to 7, 17). Incidents distributed without pattern
throughout the United States. A few were outside the U. S., but two
descriptions of appearance of performance were exactly alike. The re-
mained sightings occurred at various times of day and were.

In the following section of this report, each remaining unnamed
incident is considered separately. It is not now intent to generally
a charise type of observer, but each case has undeniable elements,
must be regarded. The numerical and geometrical in reverying cases
for one or two incidents in the regions affect.

Here is the transcription of the text from the document:

---
Incident No. 37 -- 14 October 1947, 1200 hours, eleven miles North,
N. E. of Cave Creek, Arizona.

Two mine operators observed one object at 5000 to 10,000 ft altitude, travel-
ing 150Â° TPI S.E. in a straight line for a period of 15-60 seconds. The object
was red against the sky, and black against a cloud. It appeared between
7 to 3 inches in diameter through pit of observers; on. This CRT tar of investi three states
that one observer thought it was a buzzard, but decided later that it was not;
the other observer said it resembled a flying wing, but was not a flying wing.
No reasons are given for these apparently superfluous and conflicting remarks.
As in many other instances, these observers cite their flying experience as
qualification for their ability to observe and report details.

AIG Opinion: From the limited data furnished in this report, it is
difficult to arrive at any conclusion. If the object was actually 10,000 ft
distant, and 7" to 3" appeared three feet in diam to the obs nary, it would of necessity
been huge. This sole point of contention tends to discredit the report.

The image provided shows a page that appears to be a document with typewritten text and some hand-drawn markings at the top. There are black redaction bars obscuring some of the text. There are no photographs present on this page.

Due to the poor quality of the image, the text is partially illegible. Here is the text that is discernible:

The image you've provided appears to be a scanned document page with a significant amount of text. However, there are no photographs present. The page is of poor quality with very high contrast, making it difficult to extract the text accurately. Some parts are obscured, and there are redaction marks (black bars) over specific lines and words, which would normally prevent the extraction of information from those areas. Due to the poor quality, distorted, obscured, and redacted text, I am unable to provide an OCR output of the document. If you require detailed information from the text, it would be best to refer to a clearer, unredacted version of the document.
