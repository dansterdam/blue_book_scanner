STATEMENT

Statement of sighting by M/Sgt [redacted], Greenville, Mississippi.

The unidentified object was similar to a large star, but seemed to be rotating and emitting alternate green and red flashes, and moving slowly north and downward on the horizon. The shape of the object, speed, and method of propulsion could not be determined.

I first sighted the object at 2145 hours Central Standard Time on 27 August 1953. Obscured by clouds and it was lost from sight at 2235 hours Central Standard Time. The object moved very slowly up and down, and the object was sighted visually from the surface, however the speed and altitude was unknown.

The observation was taken from my bedroom window, and the distance between the object and myself could not be determined. See enclosed memory sketch for some details. (Inclosure #2)

I have 12 years Air Force service, and hold a private flying certificate. I have approximately 300 hours of pilot flying time as engineer on C-47 type aircraft. My wife, Mrs. [redacted] also saw the object, but she has no experience to substantiate my observation.

The weather was high scattered clouds, winds aloft submove, visibility good at time of sighting. There were no meteorological activities that would seem for the sighting. There was no physical evidence of the sighting.

STATEMENT

Statement of sighting by A/1C A. E. ARCENAUX, MACS Squadron Greenville
Air Force Base, Mississippi.

Over the horizon it appeared to be a circular shape. It didn't appear
very large from our view point. Its color was sort of red, green and slight
yellow. There were only one object, and it did not appear to have any
exhaust at all. Its propulsion system could not be determined, speed could
not be determined because I did not know its distance, but it moved very
slowly. From my vantage point, its movement was not only in a westward
movement at approximately the same altitude, it just seemed to fade away into
the night. In moved about ten (10) to fifteen (15) degrees from southeast
towards the west. It appeared to be rotating. It would give alternating
colors for approximately three (3) or four (4) seconds and then would give
a steady red light. It moved so slowly that it appeared to remain stationary.
But as time went along, I could definitely determine a movement.

I sighted the object from the Control Tower at 2230 hours until 2300
hours in the southeast with weather personnel. At 2310 hours I notified
Memphis Central, and they stated no aircraft were in the area at 2312 hours.
At 2300 hours it disappeared.

At first it was sighted with the naked eye and in order to get a better
view to used a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars. My vantage point was in the
control tower at Greenville AFB, Mississippi. I'd rather not give an its
distance because it was over the horizon and appeared to be some distance
off, southwest of the town at approximately 5,000 or 6,000 feet. Capt.
Linton was the Officer of the Day and was in the tower at the time, Capt.
A/2C Hugh Mac Donell.

The weather was VFR, and there were no conditions or meteorological
activities to account for the sighting. I have no physical evidence of the
sighting.
