The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT". The document describes a sighting of an unidentified flying object near Greenville, Mississippi on August 27, 1953.

The text in the document is as follows:

STATEMENT
Sighting of an object by USAF pilot near Greenville, Mississippi.

The object was similar to a large star, but seemed to be rotating and emitting green and red flashes, and moving slowly north and descending on the horizon. The object's speed could not be determined, as the method of propulsion could not be determined. 

The observation was made at 22:35 hours on 27 August 1953. The object was obscured by clouds and it was lost from sight at 22:38 hours. The object reappeared very slowly and up and down. The object was sighted visually from the surface, however the speed and altitude were undetermined.

The observation was taken from my home window at the distance between the object and myself could not be determined. See included memory sketch for more details. (Inclosure #2)

I have 12 years Air Force service and hold a private flying certificate. I have visibility of 20/20 and experience of night flying operations. I was flying a C-47 type aircraft over this area but at the time of sighting was on the ground and not airborne. My experience and qualifications are satisfactory for this type of observation.

The weather was high scattered clouds, wide visibility conditions for the sighting. There was no physical evidence density of the sighting. There was no physical evidence density of the sighting or trace left on the ground.

STATEMENT

Statement of sighting by A/1C A. E. ARCENEAUX, AACS Squadron Greenville

Over the horizon, it appeared to be a circular shape. It didn't appear very large from our viewpoint. Its color was sort of red, green and slight yellow. There was a very slow oscillating movement, and it did not appear to have any sound. The object did not appear to have any appendages but it seemed to be rotating. It was moving at an extremely high altitude, so its exact size could not be determined because I did not know its distance, but it appeared quite small. The movement was approximately the same (5 to 10) altitudes. It seemed to fade away into the distance toward the west. It appeared (3) or (4) times it would disappear and reappear. But as time went along I could definitely determine a movement.

I alerted the crew from the Control Tower at 2300 hours until 2320 hours. No aircraft were in the area at 2315 hours. At 2300 hours it disappeared.

At first, it was I sighted with the naked eye and in order to get a better view, using 7 X 50 binoculars. I did so. But I could not determine any definite outline or shape. I feel that I may not have seen it as clearly as I wished, due to the distance and conditions of the viewing.

The weather was VFR, and there were no conditions of meteorological disturbances to be noted for the sighting. I have no physical evidence of the sighting.
