Some of the text appears to be inverted or upside down, and parts are difficult to read clearly. I'll transcribe what I can make out:

Top right corner appears to have a date, but it is not fully legible.

The text is mostly illegible due to the image quality, orientation, and faintness of the text. Large portions of the document are unreadable. There are some paragraphs that seem to be written in a standard format of an official document, but the specific content cannot be determined with confidence.

At the bottom of the page, there are some partially visible lines that look like they might be part of a routing or filing notation, but the text is not clear enough to transcribe accurately.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr.

THRU: Dr. Miley
        Col. Gilbert
        Col. Long

SUBJECT: Fighter Interceptor Squadrons Non-Compliance With
         UFO Directives (AFR 200-2)

1. This reply to an UFO report submitted by a Fighter-Interceptor
Unit is being brought to the attention of staff and other interested
ATIC offices as another of similar instances of non-compliance. The
undersigned recommends that it also be brought to higher authority's
attention as an example of non-compliance and/or apparent disinterest
on the part of certain Air Force units which are in the best possible
position to take immediate action to solve UFO sightings, but for some
reason refuse to do so.

2. Briefly, here we have a fighter interceptor unit by whose own
admission sighted an unconventional object in its area; the unidentified
target was picked up by its own airspeed radar, reported that the object was unconventional, and states that there were no known or locally
assigned aircraft in its area, yet took no intercept action. It is
assumed that ATIC is now expected to provide a conclusion or answer.

3. This matter of non-compliance with current UFO directives has
been reported to and discussed with pertinent headquarters, USAF Offices
who concur that such violations be brought to their attention. This
action was discussed with and approved by AFCIN-xl, Major Tacker, in
telephone conversation, 12 August 1958.
