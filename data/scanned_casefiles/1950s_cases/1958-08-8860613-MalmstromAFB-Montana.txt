SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
INCIDENT: Malmstrom AFB, Montana
DATE: August 1, 1958

SUMMARY OF REPORT:

On 1 August 1958 at Malmstrom AFB, Montana, at approximately 2115 hours, the radar operator on duty at the radar approach control facility observed an unidentified target on his radar scope. The target was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. It was moving at a speed of approximately 600 to 700 knots.

The radar operator immediately notified the control tower, which in turn notified the command post. The command post then notified the 24th NORAD Region Control Center at Duluth, Minnesota. The 24th NORAD Region Control Center directed the local radar site to attempt to track and identify the target.

The radar operator continued to track the target, noting that it made several sharp turns and maneuvers which could not be attributed to any known aircraft. At one point, the target appeared to split into two targets, then rejoin. The two targets then continued on, maintaining the same speed and altitude.

After approximately 10 to 15 minutes, the target or targets disappeared from the radar scope. No other radar units in the area reported picking up the target.

No visual sightings were made of the target(s).

The incident was reported to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and Project Blue Book.

SUBJECT: Fighter Interceptor Squadrons Non-Compliance with UFO Directives (AIJG 200-2)

1. This reply to an UFO report submitted by a Fighter-Interceptor Unit is being forwarded to the ATIC and other interested USAF offices as another of similar instances of non-compliance. The understandIns recommended herein be brought to the attention of as an example of non-compliance and/or apparent disregard on this particular direction.

Reasons for refusal to do so.
2. This matter of non-compliance with current UFO directives has been reported to and discussed with pertinent official authorities. This action was discussed with and approved by AFCIN-XI, Major Task. r. in telephone conversation, 12 August 1958.
