STATEMENT

I, Victor Mahler, Aircraft Communicator residing at King Salmon, Alaska make the following statement.

On 7 February 1953 at approx 0300I received a call from the control tower operator at King Salmon CAA control tower. I was in the CA communications at the time I received the call from Jerry Burrus to come to the tower and take a look at a strange light. In the sky. I observed the light for about six minutes. The shape of the light was a bright white color and changed from an orange color to white several times. There was no definite movement to indicate it was traveling in one set direction although it made slight movements in the general plane but always remained in a basically stationary position. The direction from the tower was west and the distance was very hard to judge and at the first I estimated it to be about thirty miles, after observing it for a few minutes I could see it was much closer. The size was approx ten to twelve inches. The oval shape seemed from the time to be a rotating explosion. The light disappeared but was still quite visible.

The above is a voluntary statement and is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

NARRATIVE

I, James N. Burrus, Chief Airways Operations Specialist (Airport), residing at King Salmon, Alaska make the following statement.

On 7 February 1953 at approx 0300 I observed a light in the west of the sky Control Tower located at King Salmon Airport. At this time I was on duty. The light appeared when first noticed by me to be approx 2 miles on the above the horizon. Having served 14 mos. at this airport I have never noticed a light on the horizon at this location. I was in a C-46 in the vicinity at this time in an attempt to notify my radio operators at Fighter Det. stationed at King Salmon. At approx the same time a part of 5 power Field Glasses as the light became more clearly. The light appeared to be well above ground level, changing in color from a reddish orange to white. The frequency of change was not very slow. I was unable to estimate the distance of the light. The position remained stationary with a slight side movement. The oval would become long, vertically and then return to a normal oval. There was no noticeable change in width. When the light changed its position a piece of metal being made white hot, the white was very distinctive. From this vicinity after a period of the light looked approx. one foot in diameter. I was unable to call and upon returning to observe the light I was unable to see any.

The above is a voluntary statement and is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

The light was a Red-Orange and first observed it and charged to white and back to Red-Orange several times. The light was the size of the observation lights on the end of the runway, so to 10". There appeared to be fog or clouds above the horizon, below the light. This light did not change colors regularly, sometimes faded, sometimes white, and did not appear to move. When the light was white it was very white.

                                        NARRATIVE

I, 1st Lt William F. Farley, AC 715 759, make the following statement:

At 2000, 7 February 1953 while on duty as controller in Tacts New York Radar Operations, I was at King Salmon Airport, Alaska. The Interceptor Squadron Wallis was and said that City Cal. Tower informed them that they could see an unusual light in the sky. Tower reported this light was on a fixed position and was not moving.

On 9 February I went to King Salmon Airport and interviewed the personnel who saw the light. James M. Burns who was on duty in the Control Tower saw the first to see the light. He took a bearing, true land marks to noted during the sighting and was able to bearing, of 270° from the Control Tower. I have talked with Mr. Burns several times and have found him to be a very reliable and efficient Airport Traffic Control Chief. He has had eight years of experience in Air Force Control.

Victor Mahler, Aircraft Communications also saw this light from the Control Tower. He has held this position since August 1951. I have had no previous opportunity to meet Mr. Mahler but to seemed very sincere in his statements and seemed to be a most reliable type of person.

I then interviewed Mrs. Marcelle L. Adair, wife of Joe L. Adair who is the "Chief Airway" Operator Specialist (Communications) at King Salmon Airport. Taking a bearing from the point where she saw the light gave a bearing the same as from the Tower. I would judge the distance from the Tower to where she saw the light as approximately one-half to three-quarters of a mile. She also seemed to be a very reliable and sincere type person.

I interviewed the Weather Officer at the Airport and found Weather to be as follows: On the surface there was a high pressure center northwest of Pilot. At 10,000 feet the high pressure center was still northwest of Pilot. The low pressure center was 1... of fluid at 15, 10 feet but no rain. There was a little low line between the high pressure center in the ground blocking the air flow.
