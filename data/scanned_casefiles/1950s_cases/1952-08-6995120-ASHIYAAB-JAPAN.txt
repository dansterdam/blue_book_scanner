AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

ONE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS VISUALLY OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE SECOND. PILOT C. A. McKEOWN (USAF) AT 75 FEET OF ALTITUDE. THE OBJECT WAS VIRTUALLY ONE-THIRD THE SIZE OF THE MOON AND OVAL IN SHAPE, FLYING IN A LEVEL WESTERLY COURSE AT HIGH SPEED. WHILE PASSING THROUGH A HAZE TOWARDS THEIR QUARTER, IT DISAPPEARED. OBSERVATION LASTED ONLY ONE SECOND DURING WHICH NO DETAILS COULD BE ASCERTAINED. AIR FORCE RULES PRECLUDED PHOTOGRAPHING OR ATTEMPTING TO INTERCEPT THE OBJECT. NO REPORTS OF THE OBJECT WERE MADE BY GROUND OBSERVERS, AND ITS FLIGHT WAS NOT SEEN BY OTHER PILOTS ON THE MISSION NEAR ASHIYA AIR BASE, JAPAN. THE OBJECT APPEARED ONLY MOMENTARILY AND NO DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS COULD BE DRAWN FROM THE LIMITED OBSERVATION.

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:
1. WEATHER OFFICER - ALL THIS PHENOMENON IS INDICATIVE OF UNUSUAL NATURAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE OPTICAL ILLUSION AND DISORIENTATION EXPERIENCED BY THE OBSERVER.
2. STATEMENT OF CIVILIAN TOWER OPERATOR INDICATES THAT OTHERS OF UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE WERE SIGHTED ABOUT THE SAME TIME BY OBSERVER DUE TO CONTRAILS AND GOOD-NATURED BANTERING BY PERSONNEL ON DUTY CONCERNING POSSIBLE UFO'S. HOWEVER, NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION IS AVAILABLE.
3. THE FLIGHT OF THE REPORTED OBJECT 2 AUGUST 1952, FIREWORKS WERE BEING DISPLAYED IN THE TOWN OF ASHIYA. WELL OF THE BASE, AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.

1.1 August 1952.
Air Intelligence Information Report

Ir. Central Tower Operator did not report his sighting for 2 nights of July to the control tower, believing that the tower was not open, and the information was therefore volunteered in this report. This report was not available as a confirmed or documented sighting at the time of the incident.

It was believed that the gripping of lights seen were due to extremely distorted atmospheric conditions, which are frequent at this time of year, and are regarded as to be a natural phenomena, and not necessarily connected with any strange aerial phenomenon observed in the vicinity at the time.
