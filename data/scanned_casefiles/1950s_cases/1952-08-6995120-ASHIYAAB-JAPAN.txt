AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

One unidentified flying object was virtually observed for approximately one second by train staff J.G. Brown of the 1039 Tour Vehicle and his wife. At approximately 2140 I, 02 August 1952 while walking south towards their quarters on this station. The object appeared singularly above the southern horizon speeding across the Air Base at approximately 1000 feet and disappearing over the hills not due west of this station. (The hills, as indicated by the bearings, to the south of this station are approximately 150 feet and 1 mile away.) The object appeared to be about 1 seven inches in diameter, glowing with a very bright white light and left behind a rose colored trail as it traveled.

The light had no definite form but appeared to flatten out as it disappeared over the hills. The progressive at the object was "white a light no color". The object had no metal features visible nor was any exhaust or propulsion evidence. Their was no sound. No remnants of physical evidence or interest or scientific action taken since report was made. No hours after observance. Control tower operators have negative reports as to any jet aircraft in the local area at the time of the sighting of the object. No unusual meteorological conditions observed or reported at ten miles and winds 6 miles west at nine knots.

Since the W/T object while passed over the Fussa Operations Building and the Control Tower, the operator in the tower area and in nearby buildings, Answers were negative for the night of 2 August 1952 but (see Comment No. 2) one operator stated that "four nights ago (29 Jul 52) I saw a round white disk". It was about 10 feet away and its identity was color. It appeared at the south end of the field and disappeared over the water towards the south. It was about 100-150 feet high. Check of records revealed weather was scattered clouds at 3000 feet and broken at 15,000 with winds at 15 knots at 6000 feet.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING CENTER:

1. Weather Officer at this station is currently making practice visual Balloon runs. These will have a white light and on one day at 1145, a single 1952, the balloon was released at approximately 2:30 P.M.

2. Statement of Control Tower Operator indicates that cases of unusual occurrences or unserviceable, or not individually unserviceable phenomena can be discovered by observant use to scoring and documenting. We cannot do not witness the incident. This can result in a resiliency for reporting in future observation should be made, as one officer stated, "It's probably due to a visual misinterpretation". On the other hand, the current radio and newspaper publicity could tend to alert people for unusual occurrences who may read into their events a biased belief.

3. In the night of the reported object, 2 August 1952, fireworks were being displayed in the town of Ashiya, west of the Base, at approximately the same time of the unidentified object appearance.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

4. Control Tower Operator did not report his sighting for the night of July 29th because the "log" was passed off as true* light reflections on the town window. The report in this case was not available so operator two dismissed the observance as a "nothing to it".

5. It is believed that the personnel and wife probably saw something with low may have been unusual. Neither of the two persons are believed to be sufficiently technically trained to give a definite opinion. They will only reiterate the current, regular "lie of light reflections" causing the "success".
