Here is the text from the document:

Maybe it was because a fellow newspaper editor was involved
along with the Kansas Highway Patrol, the Navy and the Air Force.
Or, maybe it was simply because it was a good UFO sighting.

About the time Miss Iowa was being judged Miss USA in the
1956 Miss Universe Pageant at Long Beach, the city editor of
Arkansas City Daily Traveler, and a trooper of the Kansas Highway
Patrol were sitting in a patrol cruiser in Arkansas City.

It was a hot and muggy night. Occasionally the radio in the
cruiser would come to life. An accident near Salina, a drunk
driving south from Topeka. Another accident was near Emporia,
generally South Central Kansas was dead. The newspaper driver
was about ready to go home—it was 10 o'clock—when the radio
tells him that the trooper had been asking was brought to an abrupt
standstill by three high-pitched beeps from the cruiser's radio. An
important "all cars bulletin" was coming. Twenty-five years of

Reportedly/Basis:

a newspaper had failed the editor to always be on the
for a story to be reached down and turned up the vol-
seconds to his story.

"The Hutchinson Naval Air Station is picking up... on their target
on their radar," the voice of the dispatcher said, as much
much of an excited tone as a police dispatcher can have a
look.

Then the dispatcher went on to say that the target was moving
in a semi-circular area that reached out from 50 to 75 miles
of Hutchinson. A B-47 from McConnell AFB at Wichita was
arose, searching. The last fix on the object showed it in
Emporia, in Marion County.

The two men in the patrol cruiser looked at each other for a
second -- two. Like all newspaper editors -- this was
well full of flying saucer spirit -- but this was
"Let's go out and look" -- we said, doubting
would see anything.

They drove to a hill in the north east of the city where they
could get a good view of the sky, and parked. In an
an Arkansas City police car, we joined them.

It was a clear night, except for a few wispy clouds
across the north sky.

They waited; they looked and they saw.

Shortly before midnight, off to the north, apparently lighted,
antly lighted, teardrop shaped, blot of light. Brighter
of bright light, sprayed downward from the blot toward the
It was big, about the size of a 200 watt light bulb.

A group of men silently watched the bright light move
and to drift and for many minutes it moved vertically on horizon-
ally over a wide area of the sky. Then it faded away.
As one of the men later told me, "I was glad to see it go.
I was pooped."

The next morning literally hundreds of people spent hours
conjecturing and describing. After all these years of sky-life,
actually seen one. Several photos, showing the big bird or light,
were shown around, and two fishermen readily admitted they
packed up their poles and tackle that night and went home.

Coyle up to this point. I have tended to discount the story short
his story. I have, I am well aware, a tendency to be skeptical
of all things.

The Air Force investigation, close to the military, tends to
will it conquer in its view of these things. Then, the military
radio picked up the reflection from burning waste gas corridor. I
am told.

This was greeted with the Kansas version of the Bronx cheer.

CANS LIGHTS
ARKANSAS CITY, KAS., JULY 19-(INS)--SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED "TEAR SHAPED" OBJECTS THAT CAST WEIRD LIGHTS IN THE SKY, CAUSED A NEW MYSTERY WHEN THEY WERE REPORTED SEEN FLOATING OVER SEVERAL KANSAS COMMUNITIES EARLY TODAY.

TWO OF THE STRANGE OBJECTS, WITH LIGHTED, DANGLING TENTACLES, WERE VIEWED FOR FIVE HOURS THIS MORNING OVER ARKANSAS CITY BY [REDACTED] AND HIS WIFE, AND [REDACTED], WHO HAD BEEN FISHING AND THREE POLICEMEN.

HE SAID THE MYSTERIOUS "BULBS" CAST A METALLIC BLUE OR BLUISH GREEN LIGHT AND MOVED SLOWLY, FREQUENTLY CHANGING POSITIONS. WITNESSES IN WICHITA, HUTCHINSON, ELDORADO AND WELLINGTON, KAS., ALSO REPORTED SEEING WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HUGE LIGHT BULB DANCING IN THE SKY.

A STATE PATROLMAN FIRST REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECTS MOVING EAST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED NEAR HUTCHINSON.

LATE, MCCONNELL AIR FORCE BASE AT WICHITA SENT OUT A B-29 BOMBER AND SMOKE FILL AIR FORCE BASE DISPATCHED TWO JET PLANES TO INVESTIGATE.

A WICHITA OBJECT ALSO WAS PICKED UP ON THE RADAR SCREEN AT HUTCHINSON.

A B-47 PILOT FROM FORBES AIR FORCE BASE IN TOPEKA SAID HE SAW FLICKERING WASTE GAS TORCHES IN AN OIL FIELD WHICH SOME THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED REFLECTIONS, BUT [REDACTED] SAID THAT "WHAT I SAW WAS NO IMAGINATION."

Due to the distance between the location of the observers and the nearest AISS-field unit this sighting will not be investigated. A-lined movement was reported by this headquarters revealed that wind-drift in the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting corresponds exactly to the course of the object.

'Great Balls of Fire' Sir Saucer Rumors

ARKANSAS CITY, Ark.-- Flying saucers made a brief bid for a spot in the news this week. Officials here got word from the Hutchinson, Kan., Naval Air Station that they were using radar to track an artificial light traveling at a high rate of speed.

The Air Force, got into the picture, sent a B-47 from Forbes AFB to investigate. They attributed the lights to waste gas torches in a nearby oilfield.

Apparently the case is closed, but some area residents are still mystified by the strange balls of fire that came out of nowhere and were seen by many.


- page 9 -

168, Kansas, July 19, 1956-Said the Denver Post in part: "... the Kansas highway patrol reported radar at the Hutchinson, Kansas aerial air station had picked up 'a ball of fire traveling east at a high speed.' A B-47 was sent into the air by Forbes AFB at Topeka to investigate the reports, centering around Arkansas City, Wellington and El Dorado, Kan. The pilot said he found only 'weak gas torches' in an oil field." Said the patrol, "The objects stayed in the sky long after daylight; one disappeared around 5:15 a.m. and the other a few minutes later.' Further east near Emporia, a Santa Fe railroad tower operator reported seeing with apparent to be an artificial light in the sky around 3 a.m. An Emporia policeman said he observed the same light for about 20 minutes. It appeared to 'come and go' like it was turning off and on."

[The rest of the text is partially obscured by black redaction marks, but appears to continue describing a "brilliantly lighted lens-shaped object with prongs or streams of light" moving in the sky, observed from various locations. The object was described as moving vertically and horizontally, with the head of the object being green or bluish-green in color.]

Here is the text from the document:

July 19, 1956-Kansas- Several tear shaped objects that cast weird lights in the sky were reported over many Kansas towns. The mysterious objects cast metallic blue or bluish green lights and moved slowly, often changing positions.

Colonel J. Air Force Base at Wichita sent a B-29 bomber, and Smoky Hill Air Force Base sent a two jet planes to investigate. A UFO was also picked up on radar at Hutchinson.

UFO News Report
By THOMAS M. COMELLA

"SAUCERS" SHATTERED LULL AS MARS RACED TOWARD EARTH: UFO investigators everywhere have predicted that 1956 would be the busiest year yet. Saucer-wise! Until the end of July all was quiet on the UFO-front. It looked like 1956 might pass without so much as one startling sighting! Let us remember, however, that "Flying Saucers" as such, just don't get a nod from the publicity boys anymore. If they are reported, they are called "moving lights," "meteor-like," "glowing balls," etc. All mention of "Saucers" and UFOs is carefully avoided.

Presently, the interplanetary discs are darting to and fro in the discs of other countries, and to some extent in America. The delay of reports that started in late August have very probably the validity of the old theory that UFOs are widely seen when Mars approaches the Earth. Since this is our last issue, it is quite appropriate that we announce that soon - very soon - there will be a UFO display over the great cities of Earth that will once and for all prove the existence of space visitors! Therefore, the "official" "Saucer" year ... 1956 ... nearly all the sightings and contacts were made in the last half of that memorable year. Adamski, Bethurum, Angelucci, Van Tassel, Williamson, etc., all had their experiences then.

AIR FORCE HUNTS MYSTERY "SAUCERS": Topeka, Kansas, July 9th. Reports of a large flaming UFO over south central Kansas today sent reconnaissance planes from Forbes Air Force Base currying into the sky on orders from the Air Flight Service at Lowery Air Force Base at Denver, Colo. Two pilots from the 55th and 90th reconnaissance wings reported sighting the object. One of them said it was in the air and the other said it was on the ground. The Naval Air Station at Hutchinson reported to Forbes that in radar had picked up "a moving unidentified object." The object, reportedly shaped like a tear drop and like a big light, was first officially reported by the State Highway Patrol on duty at Arkansas City. Air Force planes took off to search for the mystery object. Other silvery discs and bluish green objects were seen maneuvering over the area. Nothing ... absolutely nothing is "Top Secret" to the UFOs! They can monitor any conversation anywhere at any time. They often send down remote-controlled devices to make surveys over secret government installations!

Hollister, Calif. Major Booher                                     20 May 1959

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects Over Hollister, California, 19 May 1959
(AFJC-PJ-J. Troxell/AF99-215) File 263

1. The objects sighted over Hollister, California on the night of 19 May 1959 were over the area at 10 May 1959 and have been previously reported. The crew reported two objects were seen in the area.

1. The objects sighted over Amarillo, California, Izard and Freno, on the night of 22 Jan early morning of 23 Jan 1957, were thoroughly investigated. Sources contacted were the local highway patrol, and it was learned by them that the objects were star-like with their normal movement and rise in the eastern sky. There was also a beam with four red lights on it northwest of observers location. This sighting was attributed to the stars, the four red lights, and light reflecting off a few simulators on a nearby telescope pole.
