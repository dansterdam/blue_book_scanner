19 September 1953
Grants Pass, Oregon

Sept. 13, 1953 -- Grants Pass, Oregon

"I stepped outside at 1:30 AM. and immediately saw a very brilliant light distinctly east and about half-way up the horizon. This seemed to be quite close. I might compare the intensity of this light to the headlight of a car, but it looked more like a flare than a beam. It moved rapidly, but not exceedingly fast, to the south about 40 degrees, dipping and veering slightly from side to side, hovered a few seconds, made a large circle then moved slightly higher and north to a point a little short of where I first saw it. This took about 45 seconds. It then circled and hovered there about 10 minutes before gradually receding and dimming out.

From the way it circled and hesitated during its flight it gave the impression that it was looking for something such as a guiding beam, or say, a line of magnetic force."

EDITORS NOTE: The direction described with reference to Grants Pass, Oregon, would place the object directly above or close to the Oregon Vortex, a well known magnetic fault.
