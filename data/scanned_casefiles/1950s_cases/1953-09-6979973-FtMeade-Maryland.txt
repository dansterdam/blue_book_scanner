Sept. 13, 1953 -- GRANTS PASS, OREGON
"I stopped outside at 1:30 A.M. and immediately saw a very brilliant light directly east and about half-way up the horizon. This seemed to be quite close.
I might compare the intensity of this light to the headlights of a car, but it looked larger, more like a star or meteor, except that it was not twinkling. The light seemed to be stationary, and did not move rapidly, but not exceedingly fast, to the north about 40 degrees, dipping and weaving slightly from side to side, hovered a moment, made a large circle then moved slightly higher and north to a point. This light then seemed to suddenly disappear and hovered there for about ten minutes before gradually reappearing and dimming out.
during the time it circled I was fascinated and watched it closely. It did give the impression of some type of guided aerial object, or say, a line of magnetic force."

EDITORS NOTE: The direction described with reference to Grants Pass, Oregon, would place the object directly above or close to the Oregon Vortex, a well-known anomaly in that area. Faults.
