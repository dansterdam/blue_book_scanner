PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 24 Jan 51
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2415Z
5. PHOTO: None
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15-20 min
9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: An approach control radar picked up unidentified returns. No other radar in the area could pick up the returns. Believed to be due to a B-47 carrying a radar beacon.
12. CONCLUSIONS: Believed to be electronic effects from a beacon within a/c (B-47).

4. Location of the observers was the Westover Approach Control Center located at Westover Air Force Base, Mass.

5. The following named personnel observed the incident:
Capt. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Pilot
1st Lt. - - - - - - - - - - - - Pilot

2/Lt. - - - - - - - - - - - - - Pilot
M/Sgt. - - - - - - - - - - - - Maintenance Technician

All observers listed above are qualified radar technicians and observers.

6. Records at the weather forecast section show the weather for the time of observations as ceiling 1,100 feet, visibility 3 miles, winds 21 knots, 10,000 to 20,000 feet at 50 to 60 knots.

Westover Approach Control records show weather during the observation period as ceiling from 500 to 600 feet with 1/2 mile visibility.

7. No known activity, condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the observations, was present.

8. No physical evidence, fragments, photographs, etc. of the observation exists.

9. During the incident, a fighter squadron, located at Westover Air Force Base, could not be dispatched to intercept the unidentified targets due to mechanical difficulties.

10. Westover Approach Control radar is designed to be effective up to 150,000 feet and 40 miles. Also, when in proper tune, the set is designed to pick up targets moving less than 20 miles per hour.

Westover GCA is of much shorter range and did not register any unusual targets during the period of observations.

11. Reporting Officer's Comments:
Investigation reveals that whatever approach contact involved, contact was not with friendly aircraft, as there is no record of any friendlies in the area at the time. (No explanation is available for the 8,000 feet target reported approaching these objects.
(Fighter Air Division) "HARDWOOD" then contacted Fighter
23 contact, was flying in the opposite direction, how
ard and level, was flying at the same speed and level, but indicated they did not see the target, according to their radar. It is, therefore, to appear, approximately two miles apart, on any radar scope, it is considered possible that the target that subject had observed could have been avoided from the immediate radar contacts.
MINOR separation of the targets as experianced in a similar observation 20 October 1950 which was not reported at that time. The targets which approached each other to check time approached and departed on headings of 270" and 090 degrees, indicating a direct pass from opposite directions. This occurred in less than a minute, and they then returned to separate into 2 separate targets very close together, with no deviation from the formation.

The preliminary analysis of the basic communication indicates that
this unknown radar target were almost assuredly caused by the beacon in
the B-17 aircraft.

2. Additional information, as follows, would aid materially in the
analysis of these radar targets:

a. Frequency of approach control, and GCA radars at Westover.
b. Frequency of the beacon on board the referenced B-17
c. Flight path of the B-17
d. Track of the target on the airport control radar. If not
available, did the targets appear to arrive and depart in the opposite direction, or did they approach and leave the airfield on the same heading. (This will
help to determine if the fact was interception the airborne
beacon, or if it was not located to one GCA pulse).

TO MCIAZA-1a FROM MCIAZA Late 16 FEB 1951 COMMENT NO. 2

1. It is suggested that the attached letter be replied to essentially as follows:

a. A preliminary analysis of the basic data communioation indicates that the unknown radar targets were caused by the B-17 aircraft.

b. Additional information, as follows, would aid materially in the analysis of these radar targets:

a. Frequency of approach control, and CCA radars at Westover.
b. Frequency of the haneon on board the referenced B-17.
o. Flight path of the B-17.
d. Track of the targets on the airport control radar. If not available, did the targets always approach from the same direction, and depart in the same direction, or did they come from various directions and depart in various directions? This information is needed to determine if the AGC was interrogating the airborne beacon, or if it were interrogating some other source.

The text in the document is as follows:

SPOT REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. a. Observer: Mr. Warner Robins, Georgia 
b. Location: Zeigler Apartments area, Warner Robins, Georgia
c. Date and Time: 25 January 1951 at 1824 hours EST.
d. Weather C A V U: Clear visibility 10 miles on 25 Jan 51 at 1828 hours. (Official Report of Base Weather Station)

2. Mr. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ was interviewed by the Intelligence Office on 29 January 1951. He stated that in the late afternoon of 25 January 1951 he was lying on his couch in his apartment when his young son came into the house and shouted, "Daddy, there's an airplane on fire." He rushed to the window, which faces east, and looked up. He observed the phenomenon and has associated details. He identified the time as 1824 hours.

3. Mr. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ thought at first that the object in the sky was a jet plane. But the object did not appear to be moving but just sat there. He then realized that it was not an airplane but some kind of "flying disc." The object did not seem to have any wings or tail fins. It was shaped somewhat like a sphere, but flattened on top and bottom, and it was surrounded by a bright blue glow. The glow was not flickering but maintained a steady flow. In color it was "blue-white," and the light did not flicker but maintained a steady flow. In color it was "blue-white," and the light did not flicker but maintained a steady flow. In color it was "blue-white," and the light did not flicker but maintained a steady flow. Unlike anything he had ever seen before.

4. The object is estimated to have been 6,000 feet up and was stationary over the Zeigler Apartments for several minutes. Mr._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ estimated the length of the object at approximately 150 feet. In color it was a dull, greenish-black, and it was not round but more triangular in shape.

5. Mr._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ detected no odor, saw no smoke, and heard no noise.

6. The light seemed to be projected from the entire unit, not just the center. The shining was most brilliant when the glow intensified. The point of light would move slightly with this change, but in general the object would remain steady and maintain the same relative position. This would happen approximately four times. Attached is a drawing made by Mr._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in an attempt to present in pictorial form the movement of the object.

4. Contact was made with Mr. John Bushee of the Communications Station at Cochran Field (Macon Municipal Airport), who reported the following aircraft in flight in the vicinity of Warner Robins, Georgia, on 25 January 1951 between the hours of 1800 and 1900:

AF G175 at 10,000 feet 
AF G178 at 18,15, at 20,000 feet
Delta Air Lines flight 646 at 16,000 - Jacksonville to Atlanta
Delta Air Lines flight 648 at 16,10 - Miami to Atlanta
Delta Air Lines flight 625 at 16,45 - Chicago to Miami

Altitude of referenced Delta Air Lines aircraft was not determined.

2. Check with Major Robertg G. Holston, Station Weather Officer at Robins Air Force Base, resulted in information that a weather balloon was released from the Dayton Weather Station on 25 January 1951 at 1200 hours EST. This balloon was not illuminated by candle or other means. Major Holston stated that the light reflection of the sun on this balloon could not have been the object sighted.

3. Check with Base Control Tower indicated the following air activity at Robins Air Force Base on 25 January 1951 between 1300 and 1930 hours:

Type Duration Arrival
