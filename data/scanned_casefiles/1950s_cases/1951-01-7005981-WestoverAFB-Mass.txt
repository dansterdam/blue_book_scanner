4. Location of the observers was the Westover Approach Control Center located at Westover Air Force Base, Mass.

5. The following named personnel observed the targets:
Capt. [redacted]        OIC/MAC   Pilot
1st [redacted]           Pilot
1st [redacted]           Pilot
M/Sgt. [redacted]        Ex/Pilot
S/Sgt. [redacted]        Ex/Pilot
S/Sgt. [redacted]        Maintenance Technician

All observers listed above are qualified radar technicians and observers.

6. Records at the weather forecast section show the weather for the time of observations as ceiling 1100 feet, visibility 8 miles, with light rain showers, wind SE at 20 knots; winds 5,000 to 10,000 feet SW to SE at 30 to 40 knots; 10,000 to 20,000 feet SW to SE 50 to 60 knots.

Westover Approach Control records show weather during the observation period as varying from 300 to 600 feet ceiling with one mile visibility.

7. No known activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the observations, was present.

8. No physical evidence, fragments, photographs, etc., of the observation exists.

9. "DING BAT" F-86 fighter squadron, located at Westover Air Force Base, could not be dispatched to intercept the target due to limited weather. (Note: runway and ramps contained considerable ice and local weather was occasionally worse than indicated in paragraph 6)

10. Westover Approach Control radar is designed to be effective up to altitudes of 10,000 feet and distances of 40 miles. Also, when in proper tune, the set is designed to not record any stationary target, or target moving less than 30 miles per hour.

Westover GCA is of much shorter range and did not register any unusual targets during the period of observations.

11. Reporting Officer's Comments:

Investigation reveals that Westover Approach Control contacted 1100, at 1107 EST. At that time "NORWOOD" had no radar targets corresponding with Westover Observations. (No explanation is available for the 5,000 feet target reported in paragraphs). "NORWOOD" in turn contacted "HARDWOOD" (Fighter Air Division). "HARDWOOD" then contacted Mitchell Control and was informed that a 4-way-37B equipped with a beacon, was flying in the Athol, New Hampshire and Lowell, Massachusetts area, at 4,000 to 5,000 altitude. They also stated that this beacon could cause 2 radar blips or targets to appear, approximately two miles on an area radar scope in the area. It is considered possible that subject B-17 could account for the unusual observations if it deviated from the area stated or if the beacon could have had extended radar effects.

There was no separation of the targets as experienced in a similar observation 20 October 1950 which was not reported at that time. The two targets which appeared at this time and departed on heading of 270° and 90°. After maneuvers similar to those described herein, each target, when at a distance of approximately 30 miles, appeared to separate into 4 separate targets very close together, with no deviation from the formation.

ATTN: A-3 (Intelligence)

1. A preliminary analysis of the basic communication indicates that the unknown radar targets were almost assuredly caused by the beacon in the B-17 aircraft.

2. Additional information, as follows, would aid materially in the analysis of these radar targets:
    a. Frequency of approach control, and GCA radars at Westover.
    b. Frequency of the beacon on board the referenced B-17
    c. Flight path of the B-17
    d. Track of the target on the airport control radar. If not available, did the targets always approach from one direction and depart in the opposite direction, or did they expand and leave the station at the same azimuth. (This will help to determine if the ACR was interrogating the airborne beacon, or if it were now locked to the ACR pulse.)

2. Additional information, as follows, would aid materially in the analysis of these radar targets:

a. Frequency of approach control, and GCI radars at Westover.

c. Flight path of the B-17
d. Track of the target on the airport control radar. If not available, did the targets always approach from one direction and depart in the opposite direction, or did they approach and leave the station at the same azimuth. (This will help to determine if the AGC was interrogating the airborne beacon, or if it were not located to the AGC area)."

SPOT REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. a. Observer:
Vr.
Warner Robins, Georgia

b. Location: Zeigler Apartments area, Warner Robins, Georgia

c. Date and Time: 25 January 1951 at 1824 hours EST.

d. Weather C A V U: Clears visibility 10 miles on 25 Jan 51 at 1823 hours. (Official report of Base Weather Station)

2. Mr. [redacted] Robins AFB, was interviewed by the Intelligence Office on 29 January 1951. He stated that in the late afternoon of 25 January 1951 he was lying on the couch in his apartment when his young son came into the house and shouted, "Daddy, there's an airplane on fire!" Mr. [redacted] rushed outdoors and looked up at the sky, where he observed the phenomenon as hereinafter related. He identified the time as 1824 hours EST.

3. Mr. [redacted] thought at first that the object in the sky was a jet plane on fire and that the pilot had pulled up, trying to put out of a stall. The object did not appear to be moving but just sat there. He then realized that it was not a burning aircraft because "an enormous fire or light from the top of the object was not normal." There was no smoke, and the light did not flicker but maintained a steady glow. In color it was "between a blue-white and a red", unlike anything Mr. Farmer had ever seen before.

4. The object as first sighted by Mr. [redacted] was in the South and at an altitude of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. It was oblong in shape and appeared to be of uniform thickness throughout, rather "like a flattened orange, but not round". Mr. [redacted] estimated the length of the object as approximately 150 feet. In color it was dull, perhaps black, without any gloss.

5. Mr. [redacted] detected no odor, saw no smoke, and heard no noise.

6. The light seemed to be projected from the entire unit, not just the center. The thing which most impressed Mr. [redacted] was the way in which the light "pointed" its movement of the object. The point of light would move with the object would move in a way that stripes were attached to the point with stripes. The point of the light would lean over, then the object would move until it was directly connected to the point, then both point and object would rise. Mr. [redacted] compared the action to "climbing steps". This happened approximately four times. Attached is a drawing made by Mr. [redacted] in an attempt to present in pictorial form the movement of the object.

1. Submitted herewith are reports of interviews held by this office with Lessers, _______, and _______, who sighted an unidentified flying object at Warner Robins, Georgia, on 25 January 1951, together with a drawing made by Mr. _______ Mr. _______ identified the time of sighting at 1824 hours LST.

2. Check with Major Robert G. Higgins, Station Weather Officer at Robins Air Force Base, resulted in information that a weather balloon was released from the Base Weather Station on 25 January 1951 at 1600 hours EST. This balloon was not illuminated by candle or other means. Major Higgins expressed the opinion that the balloon released at 1600 hours could not have been aloft at 1824 hours. No record of time of breakage of referenced balloon was available. However, Major Higgins stated that such balloons are normally down within an hour-and-half.

3. Check with Base Control Tower indicated the following air activity at Robins Air Force Base on 25 January 1951 between 1800 and 1900 hours:

Type            Take-Off        Arrival
C-46            1822 hrs.
