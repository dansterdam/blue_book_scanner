1. I am a consultant in the electronics field under contract to the Pennsylvania Water and Power Company. I am presently working in the Safe Harbor Power Plant in Safe Harbor, Penna. I have been with this firm for four years.

2. On 8 March 1954, at approximately 9 o'clock in the evening, I was driving south on Route 441, about 1/2 mile south of Marietta, within a block of the Safe Harbor Dam. The night was clear, low humidity and cold; there was a definite haze in the sky.

3. The night was very clear, low humidity and cold; there was a definite haze in the sky.

4. The objects were three way mirror and appeared as high light sources. They were very bright and seemed to be in a triangular formation. I first noticed them as I was driving south. My first reaction was that they were aircraft landing lights.

5. The intensity of these lights was very close to bright daylight. They were white in color. Suddenly they seemed to be making a quick movement to the left. I watched these (3) objects move their light pattern. They seemed to be moving in a tight formation. I could see no definite shape of any craft. I watched their movement.

6. For quick identification or aircraft I listened for a motor noise. I was in an area close to the ground. There was absolutely no sound. These were moving in a quick, steady way being that of a quick maneuver.

7. I estimated their altitude at between two and three thousand feet above the terrain. This was a difficult thing to do under the circumstances. To speed of their movement I estimated at very high speed. This was the most unusual thing which would be impossible by a light aircraft of the period. With this I was sure that they were not planes. At a constant rate of speed.

UNCLASSIFIED

Statement of Mr. [ILLEGIBLE] St., York, Pa.

Velocities on the order of ten to fifteen miles per hour would have exceeded their traveling flight path. The impression I obtained was the impression of a flight path identical to a light plane normally controlled.

I felt as the time of my observation that they were not controlled by an available pilot or other mechanism.

2. The three objects proceeded in a northerly direction with a wing-like formation, which I would estimate at one course (1/4) of a mile long. As they passed northward the lead object took a course slightly to the west and the other two objects fell in line with this lead object. This lead object was of a lighter color of altitude, of clean objects at two to three thousand feet, possibly five thousand feet. The other two objects have the same general characteristics of not more than the original forty-eight feet.

Statement of A/1C [REDACTED]
Det. Olmsted Air Force Base, Middletown, Penna.

1. At about 2350 E. hours on 9 March 1954, while on duty in the Olmsted Air Force Base Control Tower, Middletown, Pa., the operator on duty with A/1C [REDACTED] heard a person who identified himself as Mr. [REDACTED] tell A/sgt [REDACTED] to get his pay (Base Incident Indicator) "says ready in order that he might see something."

I did not have what to write at this moment. Then suddenly I was called to Central Tower. They said I might have seen something moving over the river. The alert crew asked if we had seen any unusual object in the vicinity of the Central Tower. We replied very briefly, maybe a reflection from our Control Tower, to which they suggested from our Control Tower to said that we did not know about lights happening. I was unable to see any kind of object which with those in the tower.

2. We called the Harrisburg State Airport Control Tower and asked (Sgt Lord) there the river went to the hills, and then at the Olmsted Air Force Base they reported three lights along the river. Along this line Harrisburg Tower requested by saying that they had along this line. The Harrisburg Tower reported a sighting hovering over the Olmsted Air Force Base Control Tower.

3. A/sgt [REDACTED] advised Base Operations of the observations and they told him to call this number from Base Headquarters through directly to PA 9 in the tower. The Base Operations told us to check with the Olmsted Air Force Base through their Control Tower. We heard something very strange over the Central Tower. The same night the Base Operations called back and said they had a sighting of a strange object near the Filler Center in the area (Group) Paxtg in this vicinity near 100 (Group) Central Tower. We called the Filler Center in Harrisburg to see if they had an observer by the name of Swingle on duty at York Ft. for the Ground Observer Corps at the time we received the original telephone call. They replied in the negative. In this case Base Operations learned the telephone number from Mr. [REDACTED] called.

Statement, [ILLEGIBLE]

7. I took the Victor Camera, which we are supposed to use for such assignments, outside the tower to try to get a shot of these lights. While I was outside the tower, the lights were still on, and I was able to use it as a flood light for a better picture. While I was outside the tower, outside in the opposite tower where these lights were seen, I could see over the river. As a result of this, I was able to take a picture of these lights.

8. Randsburg Airport also reported seeing this base.

9. Base Operations had been notified of all the information to be received before we were relieved from duty.

10. In my estimation, I saw these lights for about fifteen to twenty minutes after they had first been sighted.

This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Statement of,
A.D.43, Mechanicsburg, Penna.

1. I am an Army Operations Specialist (combined facility) in watch supervisor capacity, at the Harrisburg State Airport. This operation is under the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA).

2. On 2 March 1954, at approximately ten minutes after ten P.M. I received a call on the inter-phone from the Midtown Air Traffic Control Tower. The operator there requested me to observe for any unusual lights in the sky. He advised me at that time that he had received a telephone call to be on the lookout for strange sightings. I believe he told a taxi cab driver from York, Penna.

3. Upon hanging up the inter-phone I looked out the tower window and saw three lights in a triangular pattern on the south horizon approximately one half (1/2) mile east of me. 6 beacon No. 5 beacon is in the Baltimore Traffic Area lesson and three quarters (2 3/4) miles SE of the Harrisburg tower.

4. The two other specialists, Mr. [REDACTED] and I asked likewise to observe these lights. They were very close to the horizon about the same level with the beacon, and after observing them for about three minutes they seemed to disappear below the horizon. Very little movement was indicated at any time and apparently the movement was directly away from me to my left. They did not seem to be light or air. Due to the extreme darkness, there was no spotlight, no object was visible in connection with these lights.

5. I remarked to the [REDACTED] that the lights had the outline of a dirigible. No comment. No attempt to make radio contact with the unknown object was made. I requested the Midtown Air Traffic Control Tower if any aircraft were in the vicinity to help us identify object. A United Aircraft, 35 miles to the N.W., reported to sighted nothing at that time or area passing Harrisburg. This aircraft passed Harrisburg East base approximately ten minutes later.

6. William Green four tower advised he had no knowledge of any Navy ships in this area. William Green is a Navy Control Tower.

7. We also called the Filter Center in Harrisburg and asked them if they had any reports on aircraft in this area and they replied in the negative.

8. After these lights were out of view of our tower, Middletown Control Tower advised that they were still able to see these lights. The operator then remarked that in lights were right over the river. A short time later the operator again advised, "We have now lost them in the base".

Harrisburg, Pa.

1. I am a Civil Service employee at Olmsted Air Force Base, Middletown, Penna. and work as "Chutes Clerk" in the Flight Line, Maintenance Section. I have been on this job for three years.

2. 1 March 1954, at approximately 10 P.M., N.W. with the work, I left from shop and arrived at to come out. I went out and met a man in a patrol car near Lights in the sky, in the general direction of the Ridge opposite Olmsted Air Force Base. We were about thirty (30) to go far (4) feet away from the Base Control Tower when I saw these lights.

3. I looked into the sky in the direction in which we. sighted and saw three lights which were lined up in a row. They were moving slowly in a row. These lights were a slow move of speed. They appeared to me to be in a straight line. They were white in color and there was no noise that I could hear. As the time I observed these lights, there were definitely a few unidentified moving objects.

4. If I looked at these lights for approximately two (2) to three (3) minutes wide up to the black clouds. At the suggestion of N.W. I called the Control Tower and asked them if they had seen the lights over along the ridge. The tower told me they had not seen them. I continued to observe these three lights from inside the car about for approximately ten (10) minutes more.

5. These lights seemed to be moving slowly all the time but never changed in their instance. They were lined up of these lights never changed. This object in the sky gave me the impression of a disc with these lights extended to it.

6. While I was with N.W. on the way and while I was in the alert about I noticed that these lights appeared to be going up the southeastern sky in general direction of Maryland.

7. This statement is true to the best of knowledge and belief.

Statement of [REDACTED]
Progress, Form 3

1. I am a Service employee at Plattee Air Force Base and work in an alert capacity in the Flight Maintenance Section. I have served in this capacity for approximately three years and three months.

2. On 4 March 1954 at about 10 o'clock (P.M.) I went out on the line to "Ring-Start" a ship, and saw a fellow looking up into the sky in the general direction of the Waco River and Negroes River. I looked in the same direction and saw three lights.

3. I called the fellow who were with me, that is [REDACTED] and he joined me on the area. I called his attention to the three lights which I had seen. So looked and told me he saw them also. I then asked him to call the control tower and Field Ops who said they were. I left his and went to "Ring-Start" the ship, assigned to me.

4. While waiting for the crew chief to start up the engines on this ship, I continued to watch these three lights.

5. I noticed that these lights were not on an even plane and seemed to be slightly staggered. One was above the other and slightly off to the side. They never seemed to be below the ridge. In a matter of feet they moved. They will show the right side, then move over to a close position. They seemed in a northwesterly direction and were never in one place.

6. To the best of my memory I saw these lights in the sky for approximately ten minutes. I was not looking at them at all times.

7. When I first saw these three lights they appeared to me to be slightly to the East and above the firing range on the base.

8. This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Lebanon, Pa.

1. I am a civilian employee of Olmsted Air Force Base and work as an aircraft maintenance man with the 2851 Trans Sqdtn. I have been working closely with aircraft mechanics at Olmsted Air Force Base for the last five (5) years.

2. On 3 March 1954 at approximately ten o'clock at night I was traveling northwest in a cut off storage No. 6, when I happened to look over my shoulder and saw the chase of No. 6 river and I saw three lights moving in a northwesterly direction. These lights seemed to be above flying range near the time.

3. I watched them for a minute or so and then they seemed to bear off to the earth. I continued to watch them, but did not see them disappear.

4. When I first saw these lights I called to two mechanics who were in the shop close by. They could not see the lights flying over there. My first impression was that they might be small aircraft as a big plane hovering above the airport, but then I realized they were not going that way.

5. While I was watching these lights I saw another turn to the east. I watched this light for a while and then it seemed to fade out.

6. These lights were fairly bright, but did not change in intensity, color.

7. When I first saw them they seemed to be lined up in one line. Then they began to turn somewhat but in the shape of a triangle. They were close together. I was close to a considerable distance on the other side of the ridge. I could not hear any noise from these lights. They did not appear to be conventional aircraft.

8. This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.
