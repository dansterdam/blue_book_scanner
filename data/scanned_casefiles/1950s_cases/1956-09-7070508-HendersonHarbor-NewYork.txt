10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One circular sphere shaped object, red on the inside & green on outside. Object initially sighted at approx 310 dgrs approximately due east in a straight line. Object disappeared after 45 minutes by fading out of sight. Object was viewed visually & through binoculars.

11. COMMENTS
Wind direction, course & manner of disappearance indicates that sighting was possibly caused by a balloon. Although scrambled a/c JJA-1 obtained visual contact w/the object & the pilot indicated that obj was most likely a star. It is believed that visual contact was made w/some other object rather than original object. Evaluated as a possible balloon.
