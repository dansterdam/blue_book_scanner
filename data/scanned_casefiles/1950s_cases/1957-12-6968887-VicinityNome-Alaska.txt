DTJC Comments:

A. On the basis of all the data reviewed, some apparently exaggerating or inconsistent, because of the heterogeneous 45. cities etc. there are three points that could fit (the General) doctrine and character of the object desired:

1. Riddle w.r. Riddle (not verified) rather prominently.

2. New high-speed jet enough (F-102) just recently intended in the Alaskan Theater. or, although very limited.

3. Soviet jet aircraft of yesterday, HS. (Sil. Atomic nearly on area.

B. Difficult to complete detailed investigation.
C. However, further receipt of future information - detail will clarify the note - this incident should be UNKNOWN.
