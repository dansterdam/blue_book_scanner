Finland, Minnesota                                                 February 1953

I.   Description of Incident

At 0529 CST an unknown object appeared on a radar scope on a heading of 155° at the 140° mile range. The object appeared on the scope as being twice the size of an ordinary aircraft.

II.  Discussion of Incident

The radar station involved sent ATIC an Electronics Data Sheet covering the sighting and from this, electronics specialists determined that interference from another radar station caused the presence of the unknown "blip". No visual observation was made at any time.

III. Conclusion

Interference.
