One object, shape not discernible size head of pin at arm's length. Color varied fm off-yellow to white to yellow. When first observed, object was moving in a very tight circle. After completing four 90 dgr turns, object proceeded in a NNW direction where it was obscured by an obstruction at an elevation of 30 dgrs. Speed of object when on straight course estimated at 700 MPH.

Sighting was possibly caused by a helicopter. The basis for this explanation is the adept maneuvering of the object combined with possible human error in estimation of time & speed.

Case 165, Conway, Mass. July 4, 1956--Preceding Fourth of July's fireworks, about the same time as the Bromley and Bloomington sightings, was an incident which involved a reversible UFO. The sighter--though at first the object was a shooting star or plane, but its behavior proved differently. Said the Greenfield Recorder-Gazette: "It appeared to be composed of one bright light and although traveling at what appeared to be a high rate of speed, was able to reverse its course completely. A low-pitched hum, rather than a whir was detected. The object crossed and recrossed the sky several times before speeding away." *1
