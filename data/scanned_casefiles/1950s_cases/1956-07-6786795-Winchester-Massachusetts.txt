The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report with descriptive text about a UFO sighting.

Case 166, Conway, Mass. July 2, 1956 - Predating Fourth of July's fireworks, about the same time as the Bronley and Bloomington sightings, was an incident which involved a reversible UFO object. At first thought it was a shooting star or flare, but its behavior proved differently. Said the Greenfield Recordor-Gazette: "It appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed, and although traveling at what appeared to be a high rate of speed, was able to reverse its course completely. A low-pitched hum, rather than a whir, was detected. The object crossed and recrossed the sky several times before it disappeared."
