It is very difficult to obtain any information on this sighting. The witness is very small child and seems to have been very frightened by the incident. She was unable to give any clear or detailed account of what she saw. The incident occurred on a dark night and the object was seen for only a few seconds. The child's description indicates that the object was light in color, moving swiftly and at a very low altitude. It was lost from sight behind some trees. 
The child's mother seems to be very cooperative and anxious to have the incident investigated, but she too was unable to provide any additional details.
