1. The information contained in the inclosed AF Form 112a is considered
adequate since the information was derived from radar observers considered
qualified in their operational duties.

2. This information was not evaluated by this station since there
is no qualified Intelligence officer assigned.

3. All radar operator personnel assigned to this unit have been
briefed on procedures for obtaining and reporting intelligence information
of this nature.

AFCIN-4F-4 Comments/Conclusions: -

1. Inclosure #6: The evidence presented in this report indicates the
possibility that radar reflections from clouds or rain storms caused the unexplained
blips. Equipments which operate at S-band usually are more susceptible to weather
phenomena than L-band equipment. It is assumed that the search equipment which
did not pick up the reported blips was operating in the L-band.

SUBJECT: Request for Analysis, Radar UFO

TO: AFCIN-484     FROM: AFCIN-481     DATE: 2 Apr 58     COMMENT NR. 2
                                        AFCIN-481a/V. D. Bryant/jc
                                        7213l/Bldg 263/P Dl4

1. At first glance this report resembled what might be expected of the sighting of a weather balloon slowly descending to earth. However, the size of the return (big as a quarter) is more indicative of the return from a storm center. Since the weather was rainy, it is probable that what was seen was weather feature.
