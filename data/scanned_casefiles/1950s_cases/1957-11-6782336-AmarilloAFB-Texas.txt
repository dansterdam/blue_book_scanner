h. Any other unusual activity or condition, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.
(1) None.

i. Interception or identification action taken (such action may be taken whenever feasible, complying with existing Air Defense directives).
(1) None.

j. Location of any air traffic in the area at time of sighting.
(1) One Piper Tri-Pacer in area.

k. The following comment is submitted by 2/Lt. Richard P. Henderson, Director on Duty at time of sighting.

According to the observer he heard no sound and the object moved very fast, thus it is doubtful that the sighting was that of a TRI-Pacer.

ATIC Comment:
[Handwritten text that is partially illegible, but appears to discuss the object's movement and duration]

The observer is unreliable in reporting distances and azimuth, he is certainly first as unreliable in reporting speeds.

Under the circumstances the observer not likely saw the Tri-pacer that was in the area. We cannot substantiate.
