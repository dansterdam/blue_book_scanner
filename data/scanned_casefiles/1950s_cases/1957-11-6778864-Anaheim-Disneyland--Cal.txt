2. Two items were obtained from SOURCE during interview. Enclosure 1 was a copy of the photograph which Mr. [redacted] took during the sighting. Photograph was printed in reverse. Negative is presently in the possession of LIFE magazine and will be returned on 13 Nov 57. Negative will be available on 14 Nov 57. SOURCE stated the object covered approximately one half inch at longest measurement on a 2½ x 2½ negative. [SOURCE stated he took picture of objects while steadying camera on roof of early 1950 model six cylinder Ford. Engine was running, lights were on and the automobile does vibrate while running. The negative was dense. It took seven minutes of exposure to make the prints. Enclosure 2 was statement prepared by Mr. [redacted] which was forwarded for your information.

3. It is the opinion of the investigating officer that sighting could possibly have been caused by reflection on fog layer of an electric welder or other light source emitting from vicinity of Disneyland.

10 November 1957

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

I sighted and photographed an unidentified object at 12:10 A.M. on the morning of Wednesday, November 6, 1957.

I was driving West on Katella Ave, on my way home. As I approached the Santa Ana Freeway overpass, a strange light appeared in the sky ahead of me and a little to my right. It was visible for only a moment. I continued up onto the bridge, which crosses over the Freeway. As there was no traffic on Katella Ave, I stopped my car to look for the source of the light I had just seen. I instinctively reached for my Graflex Century Camera and advanced the roll of film one frame as a precaution against a double exposure. I then opened the car door and as I was getting out for a better view of the area, I set my range at "Inf" and I stop at 1.5 and shutter at 1/10 second. When I stood up by the car I saw the light again. It appeared to be approximately 650 above the horizon. It seemed as though it was hovering over Disneyland. The shape of the light resembled a small blip or a very thick cigar. It appeared to be a weird gaseous mass glowing in a vivid pinkish red color similar to that of a railroad flare.

Looking across the top of the car and tracing myself between the car and open door, I steadied my camera on the top. I located the light in my view finder and snapped the picture. While I was advancing the film for another shot, the light disappeared. I only took my eyes away from it for a moment. When I looked back it was gone. I have no idea what became of it. I stood there a few minutes scanning the sky hoping it might reappear. I soon gave up and drove on home thinking I had photographed a light deflection of some sort.

When I got off work that afternoon at 2:00 [redacted] Supply in Garden Grove. I intended to leave the film for regular 24 hour processing. There was only one unexposed frame left on the roll and my friends and I were anxious to see what I had photographed. My conversation with [redacted] was overheard by [redacted] a photographer with the Garden Grove Daily News, who insisted upon taking the film to his newspaper for stalling that he would develop the roll free. He took the film with him in his car and we followed in my car. When we arrived at the newspaper, he took the unopened roll into the darkroom and developed it, while three of us waited in the city room. After the film was processed, he called us in to look at the negative saying, "You didn't get a damn thing!" upon closer inspection of frame 7, which was quite dense, revealed a small vague image.

Another Garden Grove News photographer conferred with their city editor while the negative was drying.

Statement of [redacted] Cont'd

Then [redacted] enlarged and printed the negative in question. I was amazed at the sphere which appeared on the print was not evident to the naked eye at the time I took the picture. The entire image was more defined than my eye had perceived it.

Photographs, for what they are worth, were printed in many papers. At Anaheim, California, 19-year-old [redacted] was driving homeward in the vicinity of Disneyland on November 7th when, at 12:10 a.m., he saw an object he took at first to be a small blimp; pink-in-red in color, it faded from view, then reappeared, much larger. "It appeared to be a weird gaseous mass." Taking out his Graphic Century camera, he set it at f4.5 and shot at 1/10th of a second, immediately afterwards, the object began ascending. It went out, reappeared and then went out again. [redacted] GOC supervisor at Garden Grove, said "we had almost continuous sightings of a strange light in about the same spot near Disneyland... It was a large, orange-colored ball, and was reported continuously by Garden Grove observers. I don't know what it was."

COMDR ATIC

OR ELSE RECEIVED VERY EXPERIENCED COACHING WHEN MAKING THE REPORT BECAUSE HE HAS ATTEMPTED TO ELIMINATE ALL POSSIBLE QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE ASKED BY PERSONS IN THE PHOTOGRAPHIC PROFESSION. EXAMPLE: IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH HE STATED THAT HE ADVANCED FILM AS PRECAUTION AGAINST DOUBLE EXPOSURE. AFTER READING THE REPORT, THE READER IS LEFT WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHER WAS ATTEMPTING TO COVER ALL INFERENCES THAT MIGHT LEAD TO HIS BEING QUESTIONED ON TICK PHOTOGRAPHY. ALSO STRANGE THAT SOURCE "HAPPENED" TO HAVE A CAMERA AT THAT TIME, AND THAT A NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPHER "HAPPENED" TO OVERHEAR HIS STORY.

PART III: ANOTHER POSSIBILITY MAY BE CONSIDERED BY VIEWING THE PRINT WITH THE "HALO" IMAGE ON THE BOTTOM. THE IMAGE RESEMBLES A PIECE OF MODERNISTIC SCULPTURE BELIEVED TO BE LOCATED IN NUMEROUS PLACES IN U.S. AND CALLED "MADONNA AND CHILD" OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. THE BLACK AND WHITE CONTRAST TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF IMAGE IS MORE APPARENT IN THIS POSITION.

Address: [redacted], Anaheim, California
Occupation: Service Station Attendant
Age: 19
Education: High School
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was very cooperative and spoke freely. During the interview he seemed to be pleased with the publicity he had received and at times appeared immediately excited. The local police and sheriff's office volunteered that STLR8 had made six (6) minor complaints ranging from malicious mischief to someone taking keys from his car. The complaints did have some basis or were of such nature that they could not be checked.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 6 November 1957, at approximately 0010 hours PST, SOURCE was driving west on Orangethorpe, in Anaheim, California. At this time he observed a fuzzy, cigar-shaped object hovering sixty-five (65) degrees above the horizon and to the Northwest, approximately over Disneyland Park. SOURCE stopped his vehicle on a bridge over the Santa Ana Freeway and took a picture of the object. STLR8 stated that the object was of a flickering, pinkish-red color. It had the brightness of an automobile headlight several 51-cks away. The size was 1/2 to 3/4 the size of a pinhead held at arm's length. In STLR8's opinion the object appeared to be gaseous and resembled a flare molded in the shape of a cigar and supported by a large balloon. In all, STLR8 observed the object for forty (40) seconds and then looked away to move his film ahead one frame. When he looked back the object had disappeared. SOURCE stated that the bright spot that appeared on the negative was not observed by him.

The weather was described as cold with a light mist, slight breeze, scattered clouds and a bright moon.

STLR8 was fairly certain that the object was in sight thirty (30) to forty (40) seconds. During his observation the object did not move.

SOURCE observed object through eyeglasses.

SOURCE heard no sound from object.

SOURCE stated that he had moved his film ahead one frame so that he could be sure of not getting a double exposure. The picture was taken with a range of infinity, F stop at 4.5 and a shutter speed of 1/10 of a second.

SOURCE stated that he believed the object could have been a light reflection or some unexplained or unexplainable phenomenon.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER

1. A positive conclusion as to the cause of the sighting cannot be made,
however, an evaluation of possible hoax is given to this sighting. The
following possibilities are offered for consideration:

a. The sodium amber lights of the Santa Ana Freeway, from a distance,
have the same general appearance as the object in SURGE'S photograph. SURGE stated that he was an amateur photographer and took
many pictures for the local newspaper and pictures of accident scenes
for the police departments. This would account for the presence of
his camera in the car.

b. SURGE'S photograph has the appearance of a time exposure of a
light swinging back and forth on the end of a line or, as SURGE
stated, a flare hanging from a balloon in a light breeze would
possibly give the same appearance.

c. From the comments of several citizens of Garden Grove and from
news items including misquotations of the SOURCE, it would appear
that the Garden Grove Daily News is inclined to sensationalism.
Garden Grove Daily News personnel developed the negative in the newspaper darkroom unobserved by the SOURCE.

Flying Saucer, by Jingo— or Something?

[Photograph of a blurry, elongated object against a dark background]

—United Press Telephoto

"Object," according to Edwin G. Leadford, of Anaheim, Calif., is an "unidentified flying object" and he photographed it after sighting it from his car at about midnight with a camera he carries around at midnight for the purpose of photographing "flying objects." He said it flickered with a reddish-white light. Exposure was on 2¼ x 3¼ Tri-X film with a 108 mm. focal length lens—at 1/10 of a sec. at 4.5.

Now you know how, where and when to photograph flying saucers—to do his find him. Photo is believed to be unpale down. Negative was turned over to the Air Force, which will tell us what it is in 2087 A. D., maybe.

This photo was taken at 12:10 p.m. on November 6, 1957, by 119. The object, which was pinkish-red in color and looked like a gaseous mass, was firing over Disneyland, near Anaheim, California.

The photograph, in our opinion, is probably genuine. Ledford commented, "Why would I take it? I don't even believe in flying saucers."

JOINT MESSAGEGRAM - CONTINUATION SHEET

FROM: COMDR ATIC

AN EXAMPLE OF A SIMILAR "HALO" EFFECT WAS MADE BY A MEMBER OF ATIC PHOTO BRANCH BY PHOTOGRAPHING A STREET LIGHT. ALSO, SIMILAR "TAFFY PULL" EFFECT CREATED BY PHOTO OF MOON WITH PROPER CAMERA MOVEMENT. PRINTS OF UFO AND SIMULATED EFFECTS BEING FORWARDED UNDER SEPARATE COVER.

c. IT IS NOT BELIEVED THAT THE OBJECT IN QUESTION WAS CREATED BY LIGHT REFLECTION FROM CLOUDS OR SKY. BUT BEFORE THE INFERENCE THAT OBJECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH DISNEYLAND IS RULED OUT, AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE MADE TO SEE IF ANY OF THE RIDES IN DISNEYLAND ARE SIMILAR IN SHAPE TO THE CIGAR SHAPE BECAUSE THRU A TRICK TECHNIQUE A SPACE SHIP IN DISNEYLAND COULD HAVE PROVIDED THE PECULIAR SHAPE.

d. THE SKY PRODUCED IN THE PHOTOGRAPH GIVES IT AN UNREALISTIC APPEARANCE BECAUSE OF THE EXPOSURE RECEIVED BELOW THE OBJECT AND THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE NORMAL SKY EXPOSURE, I.e. TOP HALF OF PHOTO IS BLACK, BOTTOM HALF VERY LIGHT. AN EXPOSURE OF 1/10 OF A SECOND AT f/4.5 WHEN CAMERA IS POINTED AT THE SKY WILL REPRODUCE THE STARS UNLESS THERE WAS A CLOUD COVER; ALSO, THIS EXPOSURE WILL NORMALLY NOT PRODUCE AN EXTREMELY DENSE NEGATIVE AS STATED BY SOURCE. ATIC EXPOSED STREET LIGHT AT 1/10 AT f/4.5 AND AT 5 SECONDS, f/3.5. THESE EXPOSURES TEND TO DISPROVE EXPOSURE DATA STATEMENTS MADE BY SOURCE.

e. IN THE REPORT OF INCIDENT, IT IS VERY APPARENT THAT THE SOURCE HAD EITHER A GOOD WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF PHOTOGRAPHY

Anaheim, California

Evaluation: Hoax


- page 26 -

The image appears to be a low-quality, high-contrast black and white photograph with significant noise and degradation. There is a bright white area in the center of the image that appears to be some kind of light or explosion, surrounded by dark and blurry background. Some faint markings or text are barely visible around the edges of the image, but they are largely illegible due to the poor image quality.


- page 27 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Simulated

(Searchlights in...)

The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing what seems to be a scene with vehicles, people, and a large searchlight or similar equipment, with strong contrasting light and dark areas.

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

Fig. 4

There are some other markings and arrows on the image, but they are not clearly legible text. The image appears to be a black and white photograph or illustration with a grainy, low-contrast appearance showing some kind of landscape or object with a round white shape (possibly a moon or light source) in the upper right portion of the image.


- page 29 -

I apologize, but I cannot find any legible text in this image. The document appears to be a black and white photograph with high contrast, showing what seems to be a bright white object or light source against a dark background, with some tree or plant-like shapes in the foreground and edges of the image. The image quality is quite poor and grainy, making detailed interpretation difficult.


- page 30 -

The text on this page is illegible. The image appears to be a very dark, low-contrast black and white photograph with some white and grainy areas at the top and bottom, and a small dark shape or object in the center of the white area.

Incl. #1 To Report D4-ur-08-4-57 20 NOV 57 Anaheim Calif.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph with a dark, grainy texture. There is a circular or oval-shaped object visible on the left side of the image against a lighter background. The rest of the image is mostly dark with some mottled or blurry textures.

The text on this page is mostly illegible. There appears to be some handwritten text near the bottom of the page, but the writing is too faint and blurry to make out clearly. The page contains a horizontal line across the middle and is otherwise mostly blank.

COMPOSED OR MADE UP BY SOME SORT OF TRICK TECHNIQUE REQUIRING TWO OR MORE EXPOSURES OR ELSE WAS A TRANSPARENT
PLASTIC OR FLORESCENT PAINTED BALLOON OR WAS A COMBINATION
OF THE TWO. THE LATTER IS LESS APPARENT DUE TO THE SPOTTING IRREGULAR TONE OF THE CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT ESPECIALLY
NOTICEABLE IN FRONT. IT IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT THE
BRIGHT LIGHT WITH HALO EFFECT (TOP REAR OF OBJECT) WAS
PHYSICALLY A PART OF THE CIGAR SHAPE BECAUSE ANY LIGHT AS
BRIGHT AS THAT ON TOP OF AN OBJECT WOULD HAVE REFLECTED
LIGHT FROM THE OBJECT'S TOP SURFACE; THEREFORE, IT IS
BELIEVED THIS LIGHT WAS MADE BY ANOTHER EXPOSURE.

                                    Ext 5-9196/Bldg 263/E-W

1. In analyzing the attached photograph and report of incident by the source, the following facts are evident from a photographic viewpoint:

a. The photograph in question is believed to have been composed or made up by some sort of trick technique with two or more exposures or was a transparent plastic or fluorescent painted balloon or was a combination of the two. The latter is less apparent due to the spotting irregular tone of the cigar shaped object especially noticeable in front. It is extremely unlikely that the bright light with halo effect (top rear of object) was physically a part of the cigar shape because any light as bright as that on top of an object would have reflected light from the object's surface; therefore, it is believed that light was made by another exposure. An example of a similar halo effect photographed of a street light by Mr. [illegible] member of 4A2f staff, is attached as Enclosure 5. Attached as Enclosure 6 is an example shot by [illegible] of the moon and effect created when camera was moved.

b. It is not believed that the object in question was created by light reflection from clouds or sky as concluded by investigators but before the inference that object might have been connected with Disneyland is mailed out, an investigation should be made to see if any of the rides in Disneyland are similar. In shape to cigar shape because thru a trick technique a space ship in Disneyland could have provided the peculiar shape.

c. The sky produced in the photograph gives it an unrealistic appearance because of the exposure received below the object and the fact that it does not look like the normal sky exposure. An exposure of 1/10 or a second at f/4.5 when camera is pointed at the sky will reproduce the stars unless there was a cloud cover; also, this exposure will normally not produce an extremely dense negative as stated by source. Mr. [illegible] Enclosure 5 (street light) at 1/10 at f/4.5 and Enclosure 6 (moon) at 5 seconds, f/3.5. These exposures tend to disprove exposure data statements made by source.

d. In the report of incident, it is very apparent that the source had either a good working knowledge of photography or else received very experienced coaching when making the report because he has attempted to eliminate all possible questions that might be asked by persons in the photographic profession. Example: In the first paragraph he stated that he advanced film as precaution against double exposure. After reading the report, the reader is left with the impression that the photographer was attempting to cover all inferences that might lead to the thought of trick photography.

e. Also inclosed are copy prints and negative print as requested.
