(9) Witnesses:
M/Sgt William E. Royal, AF-20433639
Air Police Squadron, Holloman AFB

M/Sgt Rayburn F. Gotsinger, AF-19018173
3023 Base Service Squadron, Holloman AFB

3. This object was sighted by the observers as they were leaving the main gate of Holloman Air Force Base. The object remained in view in the northeastern part of the sky at all times until they arrived at Oscura, New Mexico. The observers, M/Sgt Royal, stated it definitely was not a star, and further, they stated it could not have been the morning star as they kept the object in view even after the sun arose. During its slow ascent, the object gradually began to take on a pointed shape at the bottom of the object, giving it the appearance of an ice-cream cone. The observers advised that the lower part of the object slowly swung back and forth in the manner of a pendulum and would occasionally reflect the light of the sun.

4. At there was no radar in operation at the time of the sighting. Checks were made with the Base Weather Squadron, Operations & Project Section, Electronics & Atmosphere Research Branch, Holloman AFB, at the Wide Sands Proving Ground Research Branch and the Base Weather Squadron, Big Sand, N.M. to determine that no testing devices had been released which would account for the sighting. There were no planes in the air from the local civilian airports at that time nor were there any official flights in the area from Holloman AFB or to Holloman AFB.
