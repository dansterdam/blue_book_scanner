February 15, 1957. Dr. [redacted], a well-known physician of Mamaroneck, N. Y., was watching television with his wife when she noticed a bright light outside the eastward-facing picture window in their living room. Both of them went outdoors, to the terrace, where they saw the object as "about twice as big as the landing light on a plane." It was oval, with a bright white center and a red-and-pink "aura" around the edge. It was swinging back and forth like a pendulum in an arc of about 10 degrees; the swings were north-south and rather slow. Then, from the top of the object, four smaller objects emerged in pairs, two from the right "edge" and two from the left. These rose very rapidly, were in view several seconds, and disappeared abruptly. No noise was heard. The main object was in view for nearly half an hour; then it rose straight up at terrific speed and disappeared. The view from Dr. [redacted]'s terrace offers an unlimited view toward the east, and the object appeared to be beyond the hills in the general direction of Rye, N. Y. The object was seen again on a number of subsequent nights, including the following.
