The occurrence first took place at 2100 hours on 20 July 1953. It was reported previously through City, Arkansas to a very high source via the networks. The observers were initially in short of the City Police Station in Forrest City. The object appeared to be very very low and in a small town local to Forrest City. The observers were very clear and detailed like recorded of large altitude. It was not the usual and there was no evidence of mistake. It was visible for approximately forty-eight (48) minutes. The object was in the vicinity of Forrest City and estimated the objects to be about one and a half mile in diameter. Observers were located approximately five miles from the object. It was observed in wide daylight. It was pointed out that observers were made to judge the distance as the midpoint. It is reported to be very far as can be recorded to be resilience.

The sky was clear and the wind was very low blowing from the northwest that evening in Forrest City.

No weather stations or airports are located in the Forrest City area.

Continued and made with a commercial pilot at Brinkley, Arkansas during twenty-five (25) miles southeast of Forrest City. He has seen several weather balloons drifting around in the area in the last month and believes that the aerial object was one of those places.

The significance of this report is to supply the Air Force with information which will help in solving the "Flying Saucer" aspect.

It was a small light in the sky. So just look at it; it didn't seem to all moving out to look away then back. you Could Still it was traveling. It would be hard to give a definite shape as it only looked like a humming light ball. It would also be hard to estimate the distance because of the time of day

DATE July 18, 1953

On the day of July 10, 1953 an object over the city was called to my attention by a passerby. I observed the strange object for about 4 or 5 minutes. It was like a real bright star but definitely was not and was moving. It seemed to stay almost still for a few minutes and then started moving in a southeastward direction. The weather conditions were good, dry, warm and clear. I have no idea what it was or what it might have been.

Wired to Stores:
18 Jul 53         Sheridan, Wyo.
13 Jul 53         Shaw AFB, S. C.
11 Jul 53         Forrest City, Ark.

18 - Very probably a meteor. Sending questionnaire. Ask your confirmation.
13 - Sending two questionnaires on this one since aerial and ground observation combined. Again this sounds like a meteor.
11 - Possibility here of upper air research balloon although our tracks on Moby Dick balloons show none in Arkansas for this date.

UAR activity starting from Carolina area, however. Sending questionnaires to various observers involved. Time wrong (00152) for local balloon release. Carrying this unresolved.

Dear Dr. Hynck:

It has been sometime since we have received any comments on the sightings and am anxious to see your opinion on same. When do you expect to leave for your summer vacation? I am clearing house on 31 July but will hope to see you or at least call you before I leave. Am going to Washington on Wednesday and Thursday this week on Press Release and now PR negotiation for this Project and to tie up my projects in general.

Capt Ruppelt is due back today and as anxious to see him, and as I think I have told you, he will be part-timing this project until my replacement arrives.

Best regards,

Bob Olsson

Dear Capt. Ruppelt and Lt. Olsson:

Greetings, Captain, and glad to have you aboard again. (Pardon the Navy expression.) Here are my comments on the last few items that were sent to us. Of the three cases, one was clearly a fireball and can be dismissed. The other two cases are definitely more peculiar, particularly the Forest City, Arkansas of July 11. The questions we should like to have answered on this are stated on our regular Form "Eye." Little can be judged about it until we have this additional information.

The Shag AFB one may have been a fireball but certainly an unusual one if it went into the overcast. Fireballs have been known to break out of the overcast, but it would be most unusual for one to come through the overcast, sail away into the back into the overcast. Therefore this case should be followed up. Again, the information we would like is on our Form Eye.

I shall be in New Mexico on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (28,29,30) and will take the trusty census along. Just hoping; the following week I go to Ann Arbor and Boston. Then as I.e. Olsson has probably told you, I shall be in Europe all of September. I shall be on the watchout for phenomena over there. Last you be fearful, this trip is not being charged to the Project! Though if some legitimate occasion arises to tweak something, I shall of course do so. I certainly hope to see you at least once before I leave.

Cordially,
