FLIGHT 14 - SEPTEMBER 6, 1955

On flight 14 of the 6th at approximately 1925PST, geographical position approximately 16 nautical miles north of the FOU Omni Range, 604 degree track, at 5000 ft. with a clear sky above, unlimited visibility horizontally and a smoke layer below, sighted an unidentified object with a blue-white exhaust flame between a half mile or mile directly ahead at approximately 1000 ft. above our position on what appeared to be about a 200-210 degree heading in about a 15-20 degree angle descent.

In approximately 3 seconds the object had moved from directly in front of us to about 100 degrees from our track placing it off left beam and was then omitting a large sparks as well as the blue flame. At that time, it exploded with a blinding flash within, I would say, a half mile or mile of our position.

Flight 412, who, I believe, was in the vicinity of ALB at about 800 ft. reported seeing, I flash, all over the was northbound. Southbound Flight 33 who was approximately just south of Coxsackie at about 6000 ft. also reported seeing the flash.

I could not see what the object was except that it appeared like a rocket ship - although that is, perhaps, partially imagination because all I really got was a look at was this trail of flame and, just before it exploded, it seemed like pictures I have seen of a stage falling off of a rocket. I don't think it was an airplane as I did not observe any position lights. I feel certain that it was not a meteor as we had been looking in that direction and it just appeared. There was no trace of it until it got right in front of us. Its speed did not seem to have been in excess of 400-500 mph.

On flight 14 of the 6th at approximately 1925ST, geographical position approximately 16 nautical miles north of the POU Omni Range, CO4 degree track, at 5000 ft., with a clear sky horizontal visibility tally and a smoke layer below, sighted an unidentified object with a blue-white exhaust flame between a half mile or mile directly ahead at approximately 1000 ft. moves our position on what appeared to be about a 200-210 degree heading in about a 15-20 degree angle descent.

In approximately 3 seconds the object had moved from directly in front of us to about 100 degrees from our track placing it off left beam and was then emitting a lack of sparks as well as the blue flame.

At approximately 1955T while southbound at 6000 ft. on B12 at Red Hook intersection, noticed a bright flash above us. Because we were flying through slight Cu build ups with the fuselage lights on, I attributed it to the flash of these lights while inside on of the Cu's, thought no more of it until I and Flight 1A advise New York of his sighting and we then advised that I had seen the flash.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a young man, very cooperative in rendering answers to questions proposed to him concerning his observation. Although encouraged to exaggerate the facts of his observation by an over enthusiastic father and brother, SOURCE, nevertheless, waived this inducement and gave a clear account of the actual occurrence. In view of the above, it is the opinion of the investigator that the SOURCE can be considered reliable.

III. SOURCE DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. SOURCE, together with his brother and sister-in-law, was standing on the front sidewalk of his father's home (GCHI) at 1/4(22) at 07/0074 Sep 55.

2. SOURCE glanced up and observed a blue ball of flame, which lasted for about five (5) seconds.

3. The object was travelling in a west to east direction and then disappeared over the tree tops.

4. The object was observed for about five (5) seconds before disappearing. The sky was clear with no moon or stars observed. The night was very dark.

5. The object was estimated by the SOURCE to be approximately a mile or more away from the position of observation.

6. The object disappeared in a red flame. There was no sound given off by the object.

1.  Enclosed herewith is a letter from Colonial Airlines,
Inc., 8 September 1955, desiring information on a UFOB sighted
by personnel of their organization.

2.  Investigation by Detachment 3, 4602d AISS, indicated
that this sighting was probably generated by a Fireball explod-
ing in the atmosphere for the following reasons:

    a.  The object was also seen by Flight 412, Colonial
    Airlines, Inc., 110 miles north of the location of the sight-
    ing as reported by Flight 11, Colonial Airlines, Inc.

    b.  The object was seen by two observers on the ground,
    giving an identical description of the object, forty miles
    southwest of Elmira 14.

    c.  The duration of the sighting, agreed upon by all
    observers, was three to five seconds, substantiating the
    astronomical hypothesis.

    d.  It is highly improbable that any object other than
    an astronomical phenomena could be observed at night by observers
    located approximately one hundred miles apart.

3.  In accordance with paragraph 9, AFR 200-2, 12 August 1951,
release of the above hypotheses to Colonial Airlines, Inc., by this
organization is prohibited. Request that appropriate action be
taken by your organization.

II. RELIABILITY:
SOURCE was a young housewife, who was somewhat nervous during the interview. Her explanation of the occurrence at the initial phase of the interrogation was incoherent and contradictory, however, as the interview progressed she began to recall more clearly the events she had observed. It is the opinion of the investigator that the SOURCE can be considered reliable.

III. SOURCE DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
1. [Partially redacted] was standing on the front sidewalk of her father-in-law's house (GEORGE H/W LAW X722) at 07/00Z7 Sep 55 engaged in conversation with her husband and brother-in-law.

2. She was the first to observe the object and she called the other two persons attention to it.

3. The object was travelling in an west to east direction and then disappeared behind the tree tops.

4. The object was observed for about eight (8) seconds before disappearing.

5. It first appeared to be silver blue in color and then it changed to a red-orange. This color change was observed four (4) different times during the period of observation.

6. At first the SOURCE thought the object was a plane, then when it started changing color she didn't know what it was.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. To corroborate the statements made by pilots of Colonial Airlines, a follow-up investigation was conducted at Poughkeepsie, New York. The following agencies, however, did not observe the sightings reported by the pilots:

a. City Police Department
b. Civil Defense (CDC)
c. Civil Aeronautics Administration
d. Vassar College Observatory
e. Mid-Hudson Bridge Authorities

2. A check with D/F, EADF did result in the report of an object sighted by two residents of Washingtonville, New York, approximately two (2) minutes later than the sighting reported by Colonial Airlines. The similarity in description and time interval possibly identifies the objects observed as the same. The one major discrepancy, however, that could not be correlated was the directional path of the object observed by the two different parties.

3. A check with Base Operations, Stewart Air Force Base, of pilots flying in the area revealed that Captain of the 384th School Group, West Point, New York was flying touch and go landings in a T-3 aircraft at Stewart AFB. Capt. stated that a few minutes before he made his final landing at 07/0030z Sep 55, he noted a bright flash in the sky. As he was not looking in the direction of the flash he attributed it to lightning, but after thinking it over, and having observed no thunderstorm in the area he decided it could not have been lightning. Capt. did not report the sighting and made no further effort to find out what the flash could have been.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER

1. It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the object sighted by the different groups of observers was possibly a celestial phenomenon known as a fireball.

2. The description of this object follows along the description of a fireball which explodes at the end of its flight.

3. It is believed that the report as given by the crew was in error as pertains to the distance of the object.

a. They stated that the object appeared one-half to one mile directly ahead of them about 1000 feet above, headed in a south-west direction at a 15-20 degree angle of descent and within three (3) seconds disappeared off their left wing tip. It is believed that this distance can be discounted, in view of the fact that Flt 112 over Albany, NY and Flt 33 approximately 10 miles north of their position and in cumulous clouds, also reported the object at the same time. Flt 412 approximately 50 miles north and heading in a north direction reported same and could not have possible seen the object if it was at the close range as Flt 14 had stated. Flt 33 being in cumulous clouds with 0 visibility also noted a flash in the sky. Consequently it is believed that the objects are one and the same, but at a much greater distance than as stated by Flt 14.

b. In the phenomenon of a fireball the estimate of the distance of the object can be misinterpreted.

FLIGHT 14 - SEPTEMBER 6, 1955

On Flight 14 of the 6th at approximately 1925 EST, geographical position approximately 16 nautical miles north of the PGU Canal Range, 004 degrees track, at 5000 ft. with a clear sky above, unlimited visibility horizontally and a smoke layer below, sighted an unidentified object with a blue-white exhaust flame between a half mile or mile directly ahead at approximately 1000 ft. above our position on what appeared to be about a 200-210 degree heading in about a 15-20 degree angle descent.

In approximately 3 seconds the object had moved from directly in front of us to about 100 degrees from our track placing it off our left beam and was then exhibiting a lot of sparks as well as the blue flame. At that time, it exploded with a blinding flash within, I would say, a half mile or mile of our position.

Flight A17, who, I believe, was in the vicinity of A16 at about 8000 ft., reported seeing the flash although he was northbound-southbound, I think 33, was approximately just south of Comanche at about 6000 ft., also reported seeing the flash.

I could not see what the object was except that it appeared like a rocket ship - although that is, perhaps, partially imagination because all I really got a look at was this trail of flame, and, just before it exploded, it seemed like pictures I have seen of a stage falling off of a rocket. I don't think it was an airplane as I did not observe any position lights. I feel certain that it was not an meteor as we had been looking in that direction and it just appeared. There was no trace of it until it got right in front of us. Its speed did not seem to have been in excess of 400-500 mph.

At approximately 1925 EST while southbound at 6000 ft. on a B 18 
at Red Hook Intersection, noticed a bright flash above us.
Because we were flying through slight Cu buildups with the

lights while inside one of these Cu's. I thought no more of it 
until I heard Flight 14 advise New York of his sighting and
