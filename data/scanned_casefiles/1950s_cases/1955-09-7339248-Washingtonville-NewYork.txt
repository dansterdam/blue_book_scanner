STATEMENT

FLIGHT 14 - SEPTEMBER 6, 1955

On flight 14 of the 6th at approximately 1925EST, geographical position approximately 16 miles south of the POL Camp Rayno, COO degree track, at 6000 ft. with a clear sky above, unlimited visibility horizontal, the crew sighted a smoke trail, distinct and unidentified object with a bluish-white exhaust trail of approximately one-half mile or mile directly ahead of us to approximately 1000 ft. above our position on what appeared to be about a 200-210 degree heading.

In approximately 5 to 10 seconds the object had moved from directly in front of us to about 100 ft. across from our track placing it off our left beam and was then only about a sleeve's width as we would see the blunt flame of a flight or engine. At this time, it appeared to be traversing a turning flash within, I would say, a half mile or mile of us.

Flight 412, who, I believe, was in the vicinity of ALBI at about 8000 ft. reported seeing the flash ALI seen he was reported to be about 6000 ft., also who was approaching the area south of Gascogne at about 6000 ft., also reported seeing the flash.

I could not see what the object was except that it appeared like a rocket ship - although through my imagination because all I really got to look at was this trail of flame and, I do not know what I saw. I believe it was something that had a tremendous amount of power, and that the trail like thing was some kind of a rocket type propulsion system. It did not give any position lights.

I feel certain that it was not a meteor as we had been looking in that direction and it just appeared. There was no trace of it until it got right in front of us. Its speed did not seem to have been in excess of 1000-1500 mph.

FLIGHT 14 - SEPTEMBER 6, 1955
On flight 14 of the 6th at approximately 1925FST, geographical position approximately 16 nautical miles north of the POU Omni Range, GOA degree track, at 6000 ft. with a clear sky above, unlimited ceiling, I observed a brilliantly lighted object with a bluish-white exhaust flame between a half mile or mile directly ahead at approximately 1926FST, slightly above our position as we were climbing it a 15-20 degree angle descent.
In approximately 3 minutes the object had moved directly in front of us to about 100 degrees from our track placing it off our left beam and was then emitting a lot of sparks as we'll as the blue flame. At that time, it exploded with a blinding flash within, I would say, a half mile or mile of our position.
Flight 12, who I believe, was in the vicinity of ALB at about 8000 ft. reported seeing the flash and that as was background. Southbound Flight 33 who was approximately just south of Coxsackie at about 6000 ft., also reported seeing the flash.
I could not see what the object was except that it appeared like a rocket ship - perhaps partially ignition because all I really got to look at was this trail of flame and, just before it exploded, it seemed like its pattern had seen of a stage failing off of a rocket. I feel certain that it was not a meteor as we had been looking in that direction and it just appeared. There was no trace of it until it got right in front of us. Its speed did not seem to have been in excess of 1000-1500 mph.

At approximately 19:25T while southbound at 6000 ft. on R18 at Red Hook intersection, noticed a bright flash above us. Because we were flying through a slight cumulus cloud with the sun shining on it, I attributed it to the flash of this cloud while inside one of these clouds. We made no other observation of this sighting and were then advised that we had seen the sighting.

1. Enclosed herewith is a letter from Colonial Airlines, Inc., 8 September 1955, desiring information on a UFOB sighted by personnel of their organization.

2. Investigation by Detachment 3, 4602d AISS, indicated that this sighting was probably generated by a fireball explosion in the atmosphere for the following reasons:

a. The object was seen by Flight 112, Colonial Airlines, Inc., fifty miles north of the location of the sighting as reported by Colonial Airlines, Inc.
b. The object was seen by two observers on the ground, giving an identical description of the object, forty miles south southeast of Flight 112.
c. The duration of the sighting, agreed upon by all observers, was three to five seconds, substantiating the astronomical hypothesis.
d. It is highly improbable that any object other than an astronomical phenomena could be observed at night by observers located approximately one hundred miles apart.

3. In accordance with paragraph 9, AFR 200-2, 12 August 1954, release of the above hypotheses to Colonial Airlines, Inc. by this organization is prohibited. Request that appropriate action be taken by your organization.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. To corroborate the statements made by pilots of Colonial Airlines, a follow-up investigation was conducted at Poughkeepsie, New York. The following agencies, however, did not observe the sightings reported by the pilots:
a. City Police Department
b. Civil Defense (CDC)
c. Civil Aeronautics Administration 
d. Vassar College Observatory
e. Mid-Hudson Bridge Authorities

2. A check with D/I, RADC did result in the report of an object sighted by two residents of Washingtonville, New York, approximately two (2) minutes after the sighting reported by Colonial Airlines. The similarity in description and time interval possibly identifies the object, however, the ground observers could not actually observe the path of the object.

3. A check with Capt. Wm. K. Stewart, Air Force Base at Poughkeepsie, revealed that a Captain flying touch and go landings in a T-33 jet aircraft at Stewart AFB, Capt. McGovern, on 07/30/52 Sep 55, he noted a bright flash in the sky. As he was not looking in the direction of the flash, he attributed it to lightning. But after thinking it over, he did not report the sighting and made no further effort to find out what the flash could have been.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the object sighted by the different groups of observers was possibly a celestial phenomenon.
2. The description of this object follows along the description of a fireball which explodes at the end of its flight.
3. It is believed that the report as given by the crew was in error as pertains to the distance of the object.
4. Tiny stated that the object appeared one-half to one mile directly ahead of them. USCO for a moment, headed in a southwesterly direction at a distance of 32 seconds disappeared off their left wing tip. It is believed that this distance can be discounted in view of the fact that FIL A/L over Albany, NY and Flt 3 approximately 10 miles north of their position and in cumulus clouds, also reported that the object at the same time was very much closer and approximately directly under them.
5. In the phenomenon of a fireball the estimate of the distance of the object can be misleading.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting was probably caused by a fireball exploding in the atmosphere.

FLIGHT 14 - SEPTEMBER 6, 1955

On Flight 14 of the 6th at approximately 1925 EST, geographical position approximately 10 miles east of Washingtonville, New York, the 5700 Ft. indicated altitude, my crew and I observed an unidentified object with a blue-white exhaust flame.

The object had a half-mile or mile directly ahead in our track, climbing at an angle of approximately 1000 ft. above our position on what appeared to be about a 200-210 degree course in an accelerated flight descent.

In approximately 3 seconds the object had moved from directly in front of us to about 100 degrees off our track, shutting off completely a blinding flash within, trailing a bluish flame.

Flight 13, when I believe, was in the vicinity of ALB at about 8500 ft. reported seeing the flash although he was northbound. Southbound flight 35 who was within 600 ft. also reported seeing the flash.

I could see as the object was escape that it appeared like a rocket whip - although that is, perhaps, partially instinctive, inasmuch as all I really saw was a peak at this recall of flight and, just before it exploded, this seemed to be the picture I have in my mind's eye - a flaming, falling off of a projected object.

I feel certain that it was not a meteor as we had been looking in that direction and it just appeared. There was no trace of it until it got right in front of us. Its speed did not seem to have been decreased to have been in our cone of vision.

At approximately 1925 EST while southbound at 6000 ft. on a B-18 aircraft flown investigation, members observed a white light, spherical in shape, with the fuselage lights off. As I approached it to get a better look, it showed up in a flash, giving the impression that it might have had a flash attached to it. A second later, it disappeared and another flash was seen at a different location. After a few minutes, we again observed a flash near the first location. We then advised that we had seen the flash.
