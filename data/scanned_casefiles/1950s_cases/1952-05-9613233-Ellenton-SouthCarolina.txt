The only text I can clearly see on this document is "4, 1952" on the right side of the page, which appears to be a date. There is an oval-shaped object in the upper portion of the page and some geometric/architectural line drawings in the bottom left corner of the page. The rest of the page appears to be a light gray/white background with some small scattered dots.


- page 2 -

I can only see a few legible characters in this very grainy, low-contrast black and white document:

The letter "U" appears near the top center of the image.

At the bottom of the image are two triangular or angled shapes with circular objects next to them.

Most of the document is too illegible to read with confidence.

[Unidentified Objects] Sighted by Four Employees of the DuPont Company, Savannah River Plant, Ellenton, S. C., at 220.5 Hours
Documents and Dissemination Branch, Collection Division, Dir. of Intelligence, DCS/O
Counter Intelligence Div, Dir. of Special Investigations, The Inspector General

Code 192, X-140

1. On 14 May 1952, the Federal Bureau of Investigation telephonically furnished the following information in regard to the above subject:

"At approximately 22.5 hours, May 10, 1952, four (4) employees of the DuPont Company, employed at the Savannah River Plant, Ellenton, South Carolina, saw four disc shaped objects approach the 400 area from the south, disappearing in a northerly direction.

"At approximately 2305 hours, the same employees saw two similar objects approach from the south and disappear in a northerly direction.

"At approximately 2310 hours, one similar object approached from the northeast and disappeared in a southeasterly direction. One more object sighted about 2315 hours traveling from south to north. Employees described objects as being about fifteen inches in diameter, having yellow to gold color. All of these objects were traveling at a high rate of speed and at high altitude with no noise.

"Eighth object approached the 400 area from northeast was traveling at altitude so low it had to rise over some tall tanks in 400 area. This object was also flying at high rate of speed and was noiseless.

"Witnesses stated that they observed objects weaving from left to right but seemed to hold general course; also stated that due to speed and altitude they were only visible for a few seconds."

2. The Atomic Energy Commission was furnished the foregoing information by the FBI. The FBI advised that no further investigation into the matter was contemplated by that Bureau.

3. The foregoing information was telephonically furnished to Major Roswurm of your Directorate on 15 May 1952.

SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, 2240 HOURS,
         10 MAY 1952, AUGUSTA, GEORGIA
         SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO:   Director of Special Investigations
      Headquarters USAF
      Washington 25, D. C.

1. SYNOPSIS: Information received from Augusta Office FBI indicates four individuals had sighted four disc-shaped objects at 2240 hours, 10 May 1952, while working at the DuPont Savannah River Project across the river from Augusta, Georgia.

2. DETAILS: FBI advised that four individuals observed four disc-shaped objects at 2240 hours, 10 May 1952, approaching from the south and moving in a northerly direction while working at the DuPont Savannah River Project across the river from Augusta, Georgia. Approximately 20 minutes later, the same individuals saw one more disc-shaped object coming from the north moving in a southerly direction. Approximately 10 minutes after this, one more disc was observed going from south to north. These individuals described the discs as being about 15 inches in diameter to the naked eye, yellow or gold in color, and flying at a very high altitude (no exact estimate in altitude). According to the individuals, the last disc was extremely low and had to "pull up" to go over water tanks in the immediate area. The individuals further reported that the discs were traveling at a high rate of speed and could only be observed for a few seconds.

3. ACTION: No action is contemplated by 6th District OSI (Ir). In event it is deemed advisable names of the individuals observing the discs can be obtained from the Augusta Office of the FBI.

In re: blue-green light over Portland, Oregon
10:15 to 10:30 P.M., May 10, 1952

Dear Sirs:

Last night I observed a peculiar celestial phenomenon, to which
I attached little significance until this morning when I heard radio
reports of a "meteoric" explosion over Seattle. Feeling that it might
be of some value, however minute, to you I am reporting it as briefly
as possible:

On the night of April 10, 1952 at 10:15 P.M. I observed a light
with a bluish tinge shining through the thin stratus of clouds in the
north-east section of the sky about 70 to 80 degrees above the horizon;
it appeared as a short streak, rather than a single spot, possibly due
to diffraction of the cloud layer. In intensity it was about that of
a search-light shining on the clouds but different in three ways from
the reflection of a search-light on the clouds. (1) It had more color
to it than an ordinary search-light's reflection (2) as stated above it
appeared as a short straight bar rather than as a circular spot (3) it
remained motionless for at least fifteen minutes which is not usual with
search-lights previously observed in this area by me.

After watching it for some five minutes from our yard I called my
wife to observe it as she has a trained eye for color. She told me it
was of a bluish-green color.

We watched it until 10:30 and then went in-doors. At about 10:40
or 10:45 P.M. we looked for it again but the light had vanished from the
sky and so had the clouds in the area where we had originally observed
it. There was no moon in that section of the sky either( when I first
noticed the light through the clouds I had thought that it might be
only the moon shining through the clouds, but since there was no moon
there when the clouds had moved away ten minutes later, I concluded that
it was not the moon).

This observation may be meaningless but I send it to you for whatever value it may have.

Yours truly,
LEG/ww

APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: ATIL Office, D/T PSAF                 REPORT NO. IR-23-52                PG 13 of 16 PAGES

12. Extracted from PSAF "Intsum" #717, dtd 0320½, 13 June 1952:

Enemy balloons: Recently several reports have been received concerning the sighting of an unidentified object in the air having a primary color of white changing to red, then to green, and located in the area of DT 201,598. These objects were seen near and on 10 May and on 16, 6, and 7 June between the hours of 2102/I and 2100/I. In the majority of cases the object was described as being orb shaped or round, at an altitude estimated between 1000 ft and 10,000 feet, and in one case it was reported to have moved very rapidly horizontally for a distance. This movement was observed through a battery commander's scope and measured for 10 miles of travel, but the operator reported that he could not traverse fast enough to keep on target. This object was observed on 7 June for 1 hour and 5 minutes by a trained Air Technical Intelligence specialist and an ordnance Technical Intelligence specialist. As a result of these observations, a forward observer investigated the area at Ogden/I June and saw a balloon being raised and lowered in a cable. D/I PSAF Comments: Most of the previous sightings of unidentified objects have occurred in the CT and DT grid areas. The high horizontal speed of the one sighting could be accounted for by a free balloon caught in a horizontal draft in the mountainous areas of that sector. The purpose of raising and lowering a balloon so near the front lines is not apparent, but could possibly be a method of communication.

REPORT TO CIVILIAN SAUCER INVESTIGATIONS
by

Subject: Object seen and photographed by [redacted] (12 years old)
in the early afternoon of Sunday, May 4, 1952

While playing in his backyard at [redacted], San Francisco, in the early afternoon of Sunday, May 4, [redacted] (age 12) reported he saw a whitish-orange object, which could have been round but from the angle he saw it appeared to be oblong, descended rapidly from the sky and stop stationary over the neighbor's house. He is not sure how large it was nor how far away, but he thought it could have been anywhere from 100 to 1000 feet in the air.

With great presence of mind he ran into the house and grabbed his Brownie camera, came out and pointed it in the direction of the object, which he easily sighted. In attitude and started to rise; however, he snapped one exposure.

He told the kids in his classroom about it and took a lot of kidding, and everyone told him nothing would show up on the film when developed. However, he was sure of what he had seen, and when the film was developed, upon an oval object showed on the photograph which is attached to this report. I am sure in talking to [redacted] that he is truthful and sincere and he believes the object is a secret device of our air force.

We are indebted to Mrs. [redacted], the teacher, for the information leading to this report.

Submitted,
