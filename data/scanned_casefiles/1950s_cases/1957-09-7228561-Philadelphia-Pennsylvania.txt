Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Your letter of 10 September to Mr. Edgar Hoover, Federal Bureau of Investigation, regarding some metallic objects found falling from the sky, has been referred to the Air Force for review.

Please be advised that the metal foil is a well known material used for electronic jamming by both our alerting jammers to render traffic and air units in the U.S. This may be confirmed by a review of Aero Charts Nr. 310, which can be obtained for the sum of twenty-five cents from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The material was undoubtedly dropped from aircraft during training flights or simulated radar exercises.

With regard to the theories, opinions and allegations advanced by you, we have established a rule not to become involved in, or comment on, speculative discussions.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

[Signature area]
