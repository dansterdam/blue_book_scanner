SECTION E

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this?
(Circle One): Yes or No

26.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
[Handwritten response appears to read: "Honestly I don't know. My guess was that object, whatever it was, was probably a celestial manner, were a good formation or the landing of some larger, unseen body. As to what they really were, I just don't know and cannot give an opinion - too much technical knowledge required."]

NAME [Redacted]
Last Name                First Name            Middle Name

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

Estimate of 200-350 Kilo per hour speed was made because there was very little log to the sound and the object disappeared over mountains approximately five miles to the west of observation post.

I have been closely interested in aircraft for a long time, especially military, as I have a son in a Navy Flyer ... and further qualifications as an observer are that I was a technician on Navy and Air Corps (WW 2) training and identification filing at the Wolfe Missile Studios during the last war. Also, I did much flying---private---many years ago.

I give you this information so that I will not be rated as a vapor-headed jerk, trying for publicity, and so that this report will have some meaning.

Additionally: This questionnaire was not received by me until September 10th, and the envelope had been opened and the inclosed self-addressed envelope removed before I got it.
