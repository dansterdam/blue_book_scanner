SUBJECT: Report of Sighting of Unidentified Aircraft 

On 29 March 1954, at approximately 2330 hours, a visual sighting of an unidentified aerial object was made by an observer at 1612 E Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa.

The observer stated that the object was first sighted at approximately 2330 hours, and was in view for a period of approximately 3 to 5 minutes. The object was described as a brilliant light, approximately twice the size of a star, and appeared to be maneuvering in the sky. The object appeared to change color from white to red and back to white. The object was also observed to make rapid changes in direction, and to stop, reverse direction, and accelerate to a very high rate of speed. The observer stated that the object appeared to be under intelligent control, and that he considered the object to be a craft of unknown origin. The observer was unable to determine the exact altitude or distance of the object, but stated that it appeared to be at a high altitude. The observer attempted to photograph the object, but was unsuccessful due to the rapid movements of the object. There were no other reports received from the area concerning this sighting.
