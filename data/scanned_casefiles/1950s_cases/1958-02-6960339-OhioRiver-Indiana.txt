10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A rnd obj, half plastic & half fibre, was picked up along the Ohio River in Indiana by 2 hunters. It eventually got to the OSI, who turned it into ATIC for analysis.

11. COMMENTS
The device was found to be a magnetometer for remote measurement of the earth's horizontal magnetic field.

12. CONCLUSIONS

☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other: magnetometer
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation

Device Picked Up on Ohio River in Indiana

1. The device is a magnetometer for remote measurement of the strength of the earth's magnetic field. The sensing element being supported by a pendulus mounting shows that it measures the strength of the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field.

2. It was probably carried to a high altitude by a balloon and then transmitted field strength measurements by telemetry to a ground station.
