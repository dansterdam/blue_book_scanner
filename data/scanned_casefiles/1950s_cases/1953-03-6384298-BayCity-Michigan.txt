DATE: April 4, 1953

At 11:52 P.M. March 22, 1953 while lying in bed looking out the window, I noticed a flaming object pass slowly across the lower half of the left on a group of three windows. Its speed and appearance was so unusual that I immediately felt it should be checked and at once checked the duration of the observation by counting "One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, one thousand four" at speed translatable for photographic dark room.

I telephonically across to the telephone and checked the time, it being 11:32:30-P.I. immediately made notes on a scrap of paper consisting its trajectory, color, appearance, shape, and appearance of sky. I then returned to the bedroom and by looking out the same window from a point close to the glass, observed the moon just barely within a field of view. I then made notes concerning its color, outline, brightness, etc. and noted my position in the room at the time of the original observation. Measurements of the room were made the following morning.

The home is located in the North Fractional 1/2 of the Southwest Fractional 1/4 of Section 6, Bay County, Michigan. The direction from the observation point through the window is almost due west.

The following was observed: The object was not seen in the two windows to the right all though the center window was clearly within the field of vision. The object moved from right to left on a dropping trajectory. It appeared much larger than Venus and smaller than the moon, was elliptical in shape slanting in the direction of motion and having a length about twice its height. It was slightly greenish in color like fluorescent paint on a clock dial in the dark. It had a soft or hazy outline as though seen through a fog and seemed to wobble as it moved. No sound was noted. There were conflicting sounds but the windows were closed. The sky had a thin overcast which gave the moon an outline similar to the object seen.

Diagram of floor plan and wall of room are attached with measurements.

[Handwritten note at bottom of page appears to read: The vertical dimension, according to notes made true, was about 1/2 the width of the dividing partition in the window, which from the angle of view measured 3 inches across.]

Re: "Flying Saucers"??

Dear Sir:

I wish to report an unusual celestial phenomena quite different from single meteors, meteor showers, and lighted aircraft which I have witnessed. The attached data was recorded forthwith except room measurements verified the next day.

Very truly yours,

1. DATE: March 23, 1953.

2. LOCATION WHERE OBSERVED: North Fractional 1/2 of Southwest Fractional 1/4 of Section 6, Town 14 North, Range 5 East, Bay County, Michigan.
(Greater detail on request)

3. TIME: 11:23:05 p.m. EST (verified within 15 seconds with Bell Telephone).

4. DURATION: Approximately 4 seconds (verified immediately after observation by counting "one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two" etc. at speed trained for use in photographic dark room)

5. DIRECTION OF VIEW: Approximately due west from point of observation (checked with pocket compass).

6. COLOR, SIZE and SHAPE: Color: greenish tinge like fluorescent paint on clock dial in dark. Size: much larger than Yemeni much smaller than moon. Length above above horizontal vertical dimension about 1½ inch (comparison about one-half the width of dividing partition in window from angle of view), measured 3 inches across). Shape: a horizontal ellipse tilted downward in direction of travel. Its outline was soft or hazy as though soon through a fog. The sky had a thin overcast, and the moon was visible in a southerly portion of sky, bright, with hazy or soft outline, and white in color.

7. MOVEMENT: wobbly.

8. TRAJECTORY: Appeared to be crossing the field of vision, rather than approaching or receding. A drop of 2½ inches across at 270 inches at an average distance of approximately 95 inches from the eye. (See diagram of path)

9. COMMENTS:
(a) Not seen in the adjoining window areas, although remaining windows were visible from viewpoint B.
(b) I am not familiar with jet aircraft at night, but speed appeared too slow for a jet plane.
(c) No sound heard. Windows closed.
