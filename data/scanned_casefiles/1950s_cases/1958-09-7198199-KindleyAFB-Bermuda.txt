There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a filled-out "PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD" form.

Very little certain since actual experience with the object was so short,
that views of it were correspondingly scanty. Nothing further developed or 
could be added.

There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a handwritten report containing text only.

Transcribing the text in the document:

There is insufficient information in this report to make an evaluation. It is noted that the saucer observed was going over a period of 2 to 3 minutes, but the visual pattern only lasted one minute.

During other sightings with a duration of 5 to 10 minutes at longer ranges, it is estimated that the object or objects sighted would pass out of an area at a rate of approximately 5300 yards per minute.
