concerning an unidentified flying object, is quoted below for information:

"I, First Lieutenant, Air Force Reserve, make the following
statement at to that I saw in the sky at 1235 hours,
3 December 1953:

I was in the town of Belmar when I happened to look
in the sky and noticed the constellation Orion, which
