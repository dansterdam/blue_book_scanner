PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 7-8 May 1957

2. LOCATION: Macon, Georgia

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local 07.20-52

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Visual

5. PHOTOS: Yes, still & motion

6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1-3 hours (intermittently) three

7. BRIEF SUMMARY (10): (10) observed three white objects SW of Macon on two (2) successive nights. Observed in 1 to 3 hrs. with slight pattern or unusual maneuvers reported. One observer (John Doe) obtained both still photos and motion pictures (8mm size) of the objects.

COMMENTS: Laboratory analysis of the photo coverage (microphotographs & large screen size projections) indicate white objs in sky, among other conventional things (what appears to be firetips, leaves, smoke etc). Density analysis of the motion picture film discloses a/c in what appears to be a small spec DO naked eye). Queries to Ft. Benning (30 mi SW of Macon) also disclosed a/c were in area two nights maneuvers.

MACON GEORGIA
INCIDENT

7 - 8 May 1957

During the nights of the 7th and 8th of May 1957, an individual and his family observed from a location near Macon, Georgia, a number of unidentified aerial objects that appeared to move in a strange and unorderly fashion. Mystified at what they saw, the family secured a motion picture and a flash camera and proceeded to take pictures of the strange white objects. The film and prints were submitted to the Air Force for examination.

A large number of enlargements were made from the black and white prints. These showed emulsion flaws that appeared to be fireflies, out-of-focus shots of leaves and other objects, and small white, oddly-shaped objects near the horizon that were definitely airborne.

The 8mm motion picture was in color. This, then, would apparently indicate with some finality the nature and existence of the UFOs. The film was projected on the screen and the objects appeared to be similar in shape and movement to those of the "Tremonton Incident".

Micro-photographs were made of the best frames and the general appearance still prevailed.

The individual frames were then subjected to certain light densities and other laboratory techniques. These immediately revealed the wings and jet exhausts of aircraft. The object slightly below appeared to be a "spent" flare or some similar object.

MACON, GEORGIA
7 - 8 May 1957

From the testimony of the observers, and general landmarks in the photographs, the direction, bearings and elevations of the objects were determined. It was established that the sightings were observed in the direction of a U.S. Army Proving Ground area a few miles away. Further investigations definitely confirmed that between the 6th and 12th of the month, large scale rehearsals and operations were taking place in the proving-ground area, as part of a joint-defense problem.

A considerable amount of artillery, mortar and anti-aircraft, rocket fire, tracers, and flares, including dropping of parachute types, filled the sky during this period. Aircraft participated. A crowd, reported as 4000 people, witnessed the exercises from within the Army grounds.
