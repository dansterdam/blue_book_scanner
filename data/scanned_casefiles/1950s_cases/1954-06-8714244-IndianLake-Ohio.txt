(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may restate information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observed phenomena in their actual sequence.

DATE: 25 JUNE 1954

On 24 June 1954 at approximately 10:15 p.m., while on routine patrol, I saw a very bright light pass overhead from east to west, traveling at a high rate of speed estimated to be about 1,000 mph. The light was described as round in shape, bright white in color, and appeared to be self-luminous. It was observed for approximately 3-4 seconds. The weather was clear, and visibility was excellent. There were no clouds, and the night sky was dark. I have had previous experience in observing aircraft at night, and this object was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. Sgt. Garcia, when asked by the undersigned, stated that Canton Sauer at Municipal Airport called at 17:14. Dayton Power & Light were advised of a sighting as a very unusual object approximately 4-5 miles NE of Dayton, and they have the exact time of the sighting.

TEXT:
Fonsi in the Mrs. 29 Aug came from Dayton reported that she had written 'report on an unidentified object which she had observed in the direction of the radar station and had been observed by several other persons. According to the report, the object moved first in a straight line and then in a circle and then darted away at a terrific speed. She called the report to the attention of Mr. Weike, Radio Announcer of station WHIO, who had also been watching the object and he verified the report. The object glowed and seemed to be metallic and was not any known aircraft or helicopter. Mrs. Mott said the object moved all around and this time, up at a very steep angle and far away faster than any jet or missile. Mrs. Mott and the object reacted against reflection by looking at and through the mirrored and metallic surfaces, through another mirrored window, and for various other tests. The case is very interesting and Mr. Weike says he will cooperate in any further investigation. COMMENTS: The sighting by Mrs. Mott in a residential area - a radar or communications station seems most likely.

There does not appear to be any photograph included in this page of the UFO report document. The image shows a handwritten page of text describing a UFO sighting.

According to the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output, the text in the document is as follows:

"It was 8:30 p.m. on June 8, 1954 that an unidentified flying object was observed in the sky over Indian Lake, Ohio. The weather was clear and the object was visible for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The object was estimated to be 33 miles away and about 200 feet in diameter. It was reported to be silvery in color and round in shape with a dome-like structure on top. It was observed to move with a "rocking" or "wobbling" motion and emitted no sound. The object remained stationary for a period of time and then slowly moved out of sight to the northwest. The witness, [redacted], said the object was unlike anything he had ever seen before and he was certain it was not an airplane, helicopter, or any known type of aircraft. The report was investigated by the local Air Force authorities but no explanation for the sighting could be determined."

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document with text.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

reported it was seen, at 2148 hours, 1734 minutes after sunset;
Visibility - 33 miles in 1 minute which suggests
to be 1950 mph) wind: 115ft/316 design - 
A12C is wind  
A12C 9 rad. 

This seems to be a handwritten document describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object. The document references details such as the time, visibility, and speed of the object. It also mentions an "A12C" which appears to be some kind of technical designation.
