Dear Sirs;

One year ago I wrote to the Office of Public Information, Department of the Air Force, Washington 25, District of Columbia; requesting an Air Force Questioner on an Unidentified Flying Object sighting. Their reply was a report of the Air Force's PROGRESS in the search for the answer to the enigma of the U.F.O.. For the past year I have been looking for someone who might have the Questioner. Recently I was rewarded in my search. The friend of a friend had the Questioner, but four of the questions were missing, and I was not allowed to write on it. I solved this by writing the answers to the Questioner on a separate piece of paper.

And this, I decided, should be sent to you at the A.T.I.C. in Dayton, Ohio.

Yours very sincerely,
[signature redacted]
