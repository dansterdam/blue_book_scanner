LOGAN, UTAH JOL.TED BY VIOLENT EXP1.OSION AND FOLLOWED MYSTERIOUS "STREAK OF LIGHT" IN SKY
The theory of a meteorite crater at Logan, Utah where an explosion was reported by many citizens, is discredited by an investigation of the scene conducted by personnel of the Geology Department of Brigham Young University. These experts have stated that the formation found in a field near Logan, Utah does not represent a crater, nor any evidence of an explosion, but is merely a depression in the ground caused by the caving in of the underlying rock formations of the Salt Lake Tribune formation to the theory advanced by some local newspapers. The experts have stated that they found no evidence whatever to support the early theory of an explosion at that place.

On May 7, 1954 the Tribune reported: "A 'conventional' meteor could not produce the crater found west of here, Sunday, and it was hoped that an analysis of the samples sent to the University of Utah might solve the mystery". But it was later stated that no meteor was found, and that the samples submitted to the University of Utah were of no value in determining the cause of the hole or how it was made.

"The statement, signed by J. Stewart Williams, professor of geology at the University, declares that the 'disturbance' found at Logan does not represent a crater at all, contrary to early newspaper reports, and that the hole was produced by the caving in of underlying rock formations, and not by any violent explosion."

"In the region extending from Clarkston south to Paradise, exhaustive interrogation of numerous persons who saw or heard the explosive phenomenon at sundown on May 7, has been carried out. The views expressed in Logan that the explosion was caused by a meteorite are not supported by the findings at Paradise, where the noise and light phenomena are still unexplained."

"And from the Tribune, May 9: 'Dr. Lincoln La Paz, spent a full day working with Dr. J. Stewart Williams and Dr. Gryde T. Hardy. On his arrival here Monday night, Dr. La Paz said the hole must have been made a 'whopper' of it containing a meteorite. They continued to place a frame around the crater and cover it with wire mesh. Workers will stand on movable planks and work with a pincer-like instrument in this way they will have robbed every place particles might remain.'"

"'My recommendation is that we excavate until we find what made the hole,' said Dr. La Paz, who is credited with recovering the world's largest aerolite."

The incident occurred on May 1 bringing "500 phone calls" to the Logan City Police Department, reported the housewives and TV viewers had their reception was disturbance. A check made later with Hill Air Force Base and Salt Lake City indicated nothing in the area for a missile launch ... A search was made but no crater was found. Sod was found scattered in all directions for more than 100 yards.

On Aug. 31, '54, I wrote Dr. Clyde T. Hardy, geologist who worked on the project, making a number of substantial questions to which he replied on Sept 1, 1954.

"Reference is made to your letter of Aug. 31: The explosion and crater went of Logan. Although a fireball was reported by several people previous to the ground explosion, I am persuentially convinced that they were confusted. One can account for the flash only and he was favorably situated to see all aspects of the occurrence."

Sirs:
Enclosed is Log of UFO and Jet activity over Cincinnati, Ohio
May 5, 1954. It may help you correlate events.

Also enclosed is my organization's latest edition of Newsletter.
Although administratively, I plan to cooperate fully with ATIC
and the USAF regarding UFO activity. In many instances, people,
locally, prefer to "keep 'unseen' sightings away from official
channels, but are willing to turn over the data to me for analysis. Others, aware of, or as members of CRIBO, keep me informed of all UFO events.
Glad that this cooperation of CRIBO, phone me of UFO-Jet activity.
Clause, what I am gathering of UFO myself and thus gather other pertinent reports from people in the city.

Sincerely,
Leonard H. Stringfield
Director

REPORT OF U.F.O. AND JET ACTIVITY OVER CINCINNATI AREA
By Leonard H. Stringfield
Director of Civilian Research
Interplanetary Flying Objects
1011 Reyton Avenue
Cincinnati 27, Ohio

DATE: May 5, 1954
WEATHER: Temperature about 40-45 degrees. Sky cloudless, crescent moon. Very little city glow. Stars out, no wind.
8:00 P.M. (Time questionable. Not dark yet.) Standing alone, looking due north from front porch of home, observed two separate pinpoint flashes of deep blue light, intense like an arc welder's torch. Both flashes were about 10 degrees elevation from horizon and about 10 degrees apart. I could not determine any substance behind the flashes and passed them off as optical phenomena.

8:10 P.M. Received the following report by telephone from Mr. Hyman Lesiow, of 1915 Stevens Ave. Mt. Healthy, Ohio:
Mr. Lesiow reports sighting a string of five or six yellow-white lights looking like "pearly sparklers" in the vicinity of Mt. Healthy, Ohio. Although, he claimed, the objects made a "loud throbbing noise", he was positive they were not aircraft. Watching no more than 2 minutes, he said when the lights changed their eastward course to veer north, the lights remained in linear order, showing no swerving or change in speed. One light, he added, seemed to be of larger diameter than the others and was of a "silver dollar held at arm's length, about 2,000 ft. in altitude" and flying about 200-300 mph. Mr. Lesiow emphasized the perfect straight line in which the objects flew, and said it left "trailing objects".

9:50 P.M. Herbert Clark phoned me. From the front of his home on Strathmore Drive he observed a shallow but glowing yellow light (9:45) dissimilar to aircraft signal or navigation lights, moving slowly (2-3 mph) to the SE. W. Others on view for one half minute. Two minutes later two jets appeared on scene coming from south, circling a 360 degree circle of immediate vicinity. The jets, he said, were considerably higher altitude than the light.

9:55 P.M. I phoned the Cincinnati Lunken Airport Control Tower. Operator, Miss Edith Harmon said the tower was unaware of UFO and/or jets in the area.

10:00 P.M. I phoned Herb Clark: Lunken Airport phone call.

10:10 P.M. Herb Clark's wife and Mr. and Mrs. Larry Thomas of same address witnessed a large brilliant, white, ellipsoid, hovering in the northeast sky about 6,500 ft. elevation. The object appeared at about 825 elevation. Size of object compared with a half dollar held at arm's length. It elevated rapidly and moved away at a high rate of speed.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document describing a reported UFO sighting. The text reads as follows:

blinked intermittently at about one second intervals for about 3 or 4 minutes, then vanished. The object was soundless. No jets in general area during the "hovering" incident.  

Received the following report by telephone from Mr. and Mrs. Donald Koerner, Demar Rd., Indian Hill, Mrs. Krueger was watching TV, she heard a motor or strange sound and called Mr. Krueger's attention to it. They both went to the window and saw the object described in Mrs. Krueger's phone call to the Rangers from that office.

Looking toward Miami and Demar Rd., about a quarter mile from their home, Mrs. Krueger watched a large, glowing, reddish-orange light in the sky. It appeared for intervals, the object had a yellowish center and a nebulous rather than a clear-cut outline and made no sound. Certain that the object was a self-luminous solid device under some one's control. Mr. Krueger said that it twice shifted position, dropping below a line of trees out of sight. Concerned, Mrs. Krueger phoned the Rangers. 

During that sighting, Mr. Krueger watched the object closely. It appeared and disappeared at irregular intervals, as though flickering on and off. Estimated from their location that the object was about 725 ft. On another occasion the body of light shifted slightly from south to north. Mr. Krueger said it remained one final shift south again before it suddenly blinked out and disappeared.

Although no color photographs were taken, Mr. Krueger noted outstanding electrostatic phenomena, a star, jets, helicopter, auto headlights and searchlights. It was something that neither person had ever before seen.

While Herb continued to watch the northeast sky, Mrs. Clark phoned the fire department their latest sighting.

With 10 x 50 binoculars, I went outdoors. Sighted dim red object, about 15 degrees horizon, flying swiftly from the northeast: the identical point where Clark and others had viewed the object hovering. Caught the object briefly in binoculars, it appeared grayish. Unable to maintain the object more than momentary impression that the object was triangular in shape and that in the binoculars the object had a tendency to pulsate or throb in its horizontal southeastward flight. I viewed the object about 4 seconds and traveling slower than the fastest jet observed during the night's activity, the object disappeared downward below the horizon which obscured the activity. The object reappeared momentarily about the same place where I had first looked at the proper elevation for its return, but saw nothing. This indicates that the object had changed its course from S.W. to more E.N.E. During this hour no jets were seen in the area.

(Approx.) Learned the following report from the Indian Hill Ranger Station. May 7 Ranger patrolling on Demar Ave. in Indian Hill reported to his headquarters, having seen a swiftly moving red serial object.

traveling from west to east. He stopped his car to observe the object, which he said was silent. He said the object was definitely
10:20 I watched what seemed to be a bright variegated meteor drop vertically in the northwest sky. Possibly an equarid, whose source is in the S.
W. square of Pegasus.
10:25 (Time approx.) I phoned Control Tower, Lunken Airport to relate the sighting. Control Tower and Larry Herron, admitting sighting the object flying southwest." Later learned that Bening saw nothing.
10:20- Herb Clark relates: Larry Thomas and himself observed jets
10:30 circling in area on three different occasions.
1st group: 2 jets traveled from South to North while one flew in opposite direction.
2nd group: 2 jets circled at 360 degree's angle.
3rd group: 1 jet, solo, flew S. W. to N. E.
10:45 I witnessed flight of two jets directly overhead, one flying behind the other due North.
10:50 Herb Clark, in car, arrived at my house. Much impressed by his hovering disc sighting.
11:05- Clark and I observed two more flights of jets flying in dual formation.
11:10
11:10 Clark phoned Dr. Gough of the Ground Observers Corps:
11:15 I phoned City Editor of Cincinnati Enquirer. He was unaware of
UFO and jet activity.
11:30- Clark and I drove to highest point of Indian Hill, 825 ft. elevation,
12:00 or more. Saw no jet activity. Clark witnessed a meteor. Observer
served two transport planes in flight near Lunken airport.
12:15 on our way home, heard in vicinity.
EVALUATION: The testimony of 10 people verifies the fact that a UFO plus jets were
in eastern portion of Cincinnati, May 5, 1954. Although meteors were to be expected, the peculiar hovering and flight characteristics of the object, especially its right angle turns, all conventional explanations seemed inadequate, besides a flying silent red object about the same time also was positive that what they saw was not meteors. All parties agree that the hovering object was a solid and intelligently controlled craft. As to the possibility of the identification of the witnessed aerial phenomena is a controversial point, as the analysis of reports by disinterested sighters and the correlation of time proves the UFO's existence, its solidity and its intelligent control.

Jets, Saucers Play Tag In Skies
A my haney watts
CINCINNATI, May 6 - An intensely interested crowd watched a jet interceptor plane
and a mysterious flying object - believed to be a flying saucer - engaged in maneuvering
over the skies of Cincinnati's eastern horizon Wednesday evening.
According to reports from these reliable witnesses, the objects were first sighted at
about 6:50 P.M. But for a couple of hours they put on a show that amazed and awed
the onlookers.
The jet, which was scrambled from an Ohio base, apparently was given the task of
attempting to intercept the saucer. The two objects maneuvered back and forth, up and
down, in a game of tag that thrilled the watchers.
The jet would make a run at the saucer, and the saucer would dart away at terrific
speed, only to reappear a moment later behind the jet, as if playing a game of "catch
me if you can."
The saucer, described as a brilliant orange-yellow color, appeared to be about 40
to 50 feet in diameter, and was moving swiftly and low on the horizon. The jet was
dwarfed in comparison to the huge saucer.
At one point the saucer hovered motionless for a few seconds, then darted away at
an unbelievable rate of speed.
From the accounts of the witnesses, the saucer appeared to be under intelligent
control and was maneuvering in a manner that would be impossible for any conventional
aircraft.
The incident was observed by Mr. and Mrs. Earl Clark, of 4975 Strathmore Avenue,
Norwood, who had gone to the Stratford Manor subdivision to watch the jets.
