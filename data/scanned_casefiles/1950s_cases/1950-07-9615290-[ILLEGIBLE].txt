Report of Unusual Incident

Type - Unconventional aircraft

Place - Redstone Arsenal, near right porch of Civilian Bachelor's Quarters.

Date - 15 July 1950

Time - Approximately 1700 Hours

Witness - [REDACTED], employee of Chief Signal Office, Washington and [REDACTED], Engineer Aide, Ordnance Rocket Center, Redstone Arsenal.

Account - Mr. [REDACTED] first noticed the unconventional aircraft in the sky about thirty degrees North East of right hand corner of Civilian Bachelor's Quarters flying at approximately 1,000 feet elevation at a judged air speed of 100-125 miles per hour in a level parallel. The object appeared to be triangular in shape and comprised of two sections. Size of said object was to my thought approximately the size of a standard door, from the distance at which it was observed, perhaps slightly larger with a tapered effect.

Direction of Flight: [A hand-drawn diagram showing the flight path is included]

The object appeared to be constructed of aluminum, highly polished, so to give a very brilliant light. Although, it must be noted that the weather at the time of sight was very overcast and a large black thunder head was directly behind the object with no sun rays possible.

In regards to the flight of said object it was followed for approximately 5 to 8 miles, when object reached a line parallel with the Quarry Pit located on the North West end of Madkin Mountain the object appeared to first be in some type of flight trouble, that is to say the triangles were seen to move or flop, one leading section turning in a clock wise motion, and the rear section in an anti-clock wise motion - both turning about 25% of a complete rotation. This action was retained for a period of approximately 1/2 minute, then returning to its prior stable flight. It was then noticed by both Mr. [REDACTED] and Mr. [REDACTED] to turn at a right angle over the quarry and accelerate with high speed to take it completely out of view in less than 3 seconds.
