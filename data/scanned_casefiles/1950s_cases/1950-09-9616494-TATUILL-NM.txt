Dear Sir:

I wish to pass on to you the following observation made by me while enroute to my duties as geologist at the Amerada State RA 11, a wildcat well being drilled in Sec 22, Township 8 South, Range 32 East, Chaves County, New Mexico. Whether it has any military significance I do not know but you may evidate the follow as you see fit.

Below are the contents of what I wrote after getting to the well. The contents were written at 8:45 PM, the observation was made about 5:50 PM. (5:50PM) New Mexico time. The elapsed time was due to the need to run up the samples in order to report in by radio.

To whom it may concern:
I, [redacted] being of sound mind and body wish to make the following statement. At or about 5:50 PM, New Mexico Time, while enroute to the wildcat well Amerada State RA, within a mile of the location I observed the following phenomenon:

An orange red ball, wider in the center than its outer edges appeared, the first time I saw it, it appeared in a vertical position, I would say it lasted ten seconds, it seemed to come forward and then, though it did not actually stop, it seemed to stop coming forward and receded. I thought at first the sun was coming back out (it was raining very hard) and the rainstorm was going to cease. A few seconds later it reappeared, this time much closer, (it seemed to stop raining) I would say maybe a mile or a mile and a half away, in a horizontal position. This time it lasted at least 15 or 20 seconds or it may have

even been a minute. It seemed to head right toward me, I was looking west, my left window was open ( I was driving a Dodge Powerwagon) and I could see it much better.

It was larger than the largest plane I have ever seen ( A B-36 or B-29 is the largest I have seen, I d o not know the type planes the air force has but have seen one with 6 propellers and I believe that is the B-29.) It came slowly in a gliding matter, getting closer and closer, I thought at first it might be a tornado or a lightning bolt, I thought I would stop but then decided to proceed as quickly as I could, it came down in a slow glide, then finally again without seeming to stop it headed back west, it seemed to bank just a little, the south end going up and the north end down, then it receded and disappeared.

The third time I saw it was a few seconds later, it was headed south and maybe a little west; more south than west, this time it appeared more as a round ball, but larger than before. Looked like a large comet, then it disappeared. I was very excited and still driving as fast as I could, maybe ten miles an hour. ( The roads were soft and filled with water).

I reached the rig and told the driller and one of the roughnecks about it, they did not see nothing. On my way to the rig after the last view of the object I thought I saw a gray hill like mass in the distance looking west, looked like some scat tered gray objects coming down. There are no hills in the area, my best estimate would be that the hill was 200 feet high, it appeared a mile away.

After being at the rig probably ten minutes it seemed to get lighter outside and two apparent patches of light to the south appeared. They were probably two miles away on the horizon. Four small clouds? appeared in the lighted area to the west and they slowly settled to the ground, and disappeared.

The rain seemed natural, I can't explain exactly what I mean, but I did see level clouds to the north and west and it appeared they were stationary and did not look like rain was coming from them, but still it was raining in that direction. No one at the rig saw the object.

This is a true statement.

1st View
This object came from a south westerly direction.
Probably 15° south of west.

2nd View
The angle of approach was probably about 30°?

3rd View

SOUTH

This time the object was headed due south.

At no time did the object seem to travel at a high rate of speed, all apparent movement was fairly slow and very smooth. At the time the observation was made it was swirling fairly steady to slow. The hour or time of observation was near dusk, I did not have the lights on the Powerwagon.

There were no distinct edges on the object, the orange yellow was fogged at the edges and the same applies to the gray band in the middle.

At no time did the object seem to be spinning or rotating.

There is no doubt I was very excited at the time of observation, especially at the time of the second view. After seeing the object disappear the last time it started to rain very, very hard.

I have made the following, rather preceding, statement in the view that perhaps if this object were a guided missile? some location of object could be obtained for military purposes.

My idea is it may have been a tornado in the making, a lightning bolt, a comet, or if possible I so-called "flying saucer".

I do not desire no publicity. I have tried to present this observation in a scientific rather in that if such information is desired it may be obtained.

Whatever the object was I did see it plainly.

Excuse the typing errors.

1. Source.
All information contained in this report is based on a personal letter from the source, _______ geologist at the America State PA "I", a wild-cat well being drilled in Section 22, Township 6 South, Range 12 West, Chaves County, New Mexico.

2. Observations by Source.

    a. While he was driving a truck enroute to his duties, at the above site, the source states that he observed, "an orange red ball, wider in the center then the outer edges." No further stated, "As first time I saw it, it seemed in a vertical position, I would say it lasted ten seconds, it seemed to come forward and then, though it did not actually stop, it seemed to stop coming forward and recede."

    b. After explaining that it was raining very hard at the time and that he thought that perhaps he had seen the sun coming back out, the source continued, "I for some later remembered, this time much closer, (is seemed so near raining) I would say maybe a mile-or a mile and a half away, in a horizontal position. This time it lasted at least 15 or 20 seconds as nearly as I have been a minute. It seemed to head right toward me, I was looking West, as I left window van come (I was driving a Dodge Powerwagon) and I could see it much better. It was larger than the largest plane I have ever seen, (a B-36 or B-29 in the largest I have seen). It came slowly in a gliding manner, getting closer and closer, I thought at first it might be a tornado or a lightning bolt. I thought I would stop but decided to proceed as quickly as I could. It came down in a slow ride, then finally rain without seeming to stop it headed back west, seemed to bank just a little, the south end going up and the north end down, then it receded and disappeared."

    c. A few seconds after the second observation the source states that the object appeared again and it was headed South and that this time it appeared more as a round ball, but larger than before. It disappeared to the South and West. Source says that he was very excited and still driving; at fast as he could, maybe ten miles an hour, as the roads were soft and filled with water.

    d. Other observations made by the source were, "On my way to the rig after the first view of the object I thought I saw a gray hill like more an the distance, looking West, which looked like no clouds exactly. My best estimate would be that the hill was 200 feet high, it appeared to be a mile away." No continues, "After being at the rig probably ten minutes it seemed to get lighter outside and two apparent patches of light to the South appeared. They were probably two miles away on the horizon. Your small clouds appeared in the lightest area to the West and they slowly settled to the ground and disappeared. The rain seemed unnatural, I can't explain exactly what I mean, but I did not look like the local rain. It seemed very stationary and did not look like rain was coming from them, but still it was raining in that direction."

    e. The source further stated that at no time did the object of his observation seem to travel at a high rate of speed. All apparent movement was fairly slow and very smooth. The object did not seem to be spinning or rotating. He stated that whatever the object was he could see 15 miles, it was not dark enough to require the use of the lights on the truck he was driving.
