OPERATIONS REPORT - 16-21 March 1953

From the 16th to the 20th of March, the following items of importance happened in Project Blue Book's operations:

1. On 20 March, Capt. E. J. Ruppelt, the Project Monitor for the past two years, left ATIC for temporary duty at the Officers Air Intelligence School, Lowry AFB, Denver, Colorado, for three months TDY and upon return will be assigned to the Guided Missiles Section.

2. The number of reports of unidentified aerial objects received during this period totaled 10 and among those probably the most important was one on 3 March from Luke AFB, Ariz. In this sighting an F-94 pilot observed a long contrail-like object at 25,000 ft. and exposed his gun camera film while chasing it. Blue Book has received the subject film and is now analyzing it.

3. On the 19th of March, a report was submitted to Project Blue Book concerning an unidentified object at Red Lion, Ohio, which was in a field on the property of a Mr. [redacted]. Project Blue Book personnel accompanied by an armament specialist and demolition specialist took a staff car to Red Lion and found that the object was merely a discarded WW II bazooka shell and assured [redacted] that there was nothing to worry about and returned.

4. During the period of this report, a sample statistical survey of 1950 reports was submitted by Project Stork as a result of a contract set up by Project Blue Book. A complete study which has been going on for approximately nine months will be received in this or three weeks. On the basis of the sample test made there appears to be no significant trends on the report of unidentified aerial objects as far as maneuvers, color, speed, time of sighting, locality, etc., or any combination of these items. However, such a study will give Project Blue Book a file of percentage data on FLXOBRPTS something that will be useful in DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS; DOD DIR 5200.10
