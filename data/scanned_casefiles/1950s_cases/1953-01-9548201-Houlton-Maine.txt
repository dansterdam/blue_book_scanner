AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT Sighting of Unidentified Object

AREA REPORTED ON Houlton, Maine FROM (AGENCY) 26th Inst Sq, Tactical Air Comd, Maine

DATE OF REPORT 11 January 1953 DATE OF INFORMATION 29 January 1953 EVALUATION

PREPARED BY (Officer) 26 Lt. John MacDonald, A'c Intel Off SOURCE 26 Lt. R. T. Gosling, 26 Lt. R. Kelly

SUMMARY Low-Low-65A 29/200/2/53 1/2/53

The information contained in the indorsee was reported by 26k in accordance with AGI 24-5, and on 29 April 1954. The object was also sighted by at least two fighter aircraft from other squadrons.

Pilot said, "Do you see that thing above us?"
Answer, "No."
Pilot said, "It sticks out like a sore thumb."

Then someone said, "If I were going to catch it I would drop the wing tanks first."

Another said that he would never admit what he saw.

The 26k sent earlier by this organization reported that the A20G was not painting the F-29 which was orbiting in the area. This portion of the AGI was in error, no subsequent report from A20G revealed that both the B-29 call our radios were being painted, only. Further, that there were no "unknowns" being sighted in the area.

Statement of Radar Observer

On the morning of 29 Jan 52 I was flying as Radar Observer in the F-94 west of an A-9583. After a few interceptions on another F-94B I was cut off for the remainder of the mission. This was because of generator difficulties.

We then flew low to the Millinocket, Pa area to try to intercept a B-29, "Snowball Able-6". The aircraft altitude was about 15,000 feet. I was then vectored toward Houlton, Pa but never spotted the F-94 which was temporarily flying over Houlton. Occasionally I took magnetic reading of 070 degrees. When over the St. John River the pilot spotted an object ahead of us. I finally was able to pick up the object on my scope at 12 o'clock. The object was pointed it out manually. We turned right so as to locate object to the left.

On descent to holding west of Caribou for several minutes at a level of 18,000 at 23,000 feet (approx 170 K TAS). We did not close on the object and soon broke off the encounter for low fuel supply.

The object was gray and in shape was thin and oval. It was at a small angle (5 degrees at most) above us. It stayed stationary in the sky during the chase. It was well-maintained and well-colored, that is, it was not shiny or luminous. There was no visible means of propulsion nor was there any exhaust smoke or contrails. The object remained unbroken in outline and there were no portholes or windows visible.

After we had looked and studied the problem I decided we had been about 6 miles SE of the St. John River when we broke off. After continuing with a time held at same level I had the object was about 1/2 to 3/4 the size of a dime.

We landed about 20 or 15 minutes after breaking-off.

Statement of Aegis Pilot

On 29 Jan 53 I was flying as pilot in a B-29 aircraft on a routine training flight. After taking a few intersepts on another B-29, the Cub squadron vectored us to the Millnocket area to intercept near Nicholas Nol-6. We stayed in the Millnocket area for approximately fifteen (15) minutes with no contact with the B-29.

Deciding that the B-29 had passed Millnocket I took on a heading of 070° magnetic, this course took us directly over Houlton. Just after passing Houlton, I observed a rather large, oval and thin shaped object about 100° above and approximately on the same course as my own (070°) magnetic. After personally sighting the object to the Radar Observer, he finally noticed it too.

The object was a dark gray color with a very definite, and clearly defined shape. It did not shine, or give off light, nor was there any visible exhaust or contrail.

We were at an altitude of 23000 feet and chased the object at .8 MACH. This chase was continued for approximately 3 minutes with no visible change in the range of the object. According to the map near local reckoning, we had chased the object forty (40) miles northeast of the St. John River. At this time we broke off and returned to base to land.
