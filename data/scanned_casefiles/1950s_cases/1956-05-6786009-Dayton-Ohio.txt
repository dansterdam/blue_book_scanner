Mid May
El Toro Marine Air Station, 
California

May 11 - 22 - Wing Air Station, USMC - Aviation Cadet from "El Toro" reports that one warm evening he observed a bright light in the sky over the base which appeared to be moving slowly and silently. He reports that the light was approximately 400-500 feet above the ground and left no trail or exhaust. The light appeared to be the size of a medium-sized aircraft and appeared to be elongated or cigar-shaped in form. After observing it for approximately 30 seconds, it suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly to the south, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. The cadet stated that this was the only incident of its kind that he had ever witnessed.

NO CASE (Information Only)                   9 May 1956
Jacksonville, Florida

"INCIDENT ON DARK STREET:

Case # 2, Jacksonville, Florida, May 9, 1956 - I received a letter from Richard M. Buggy of Buffalo, N. Y. regarding the incident of May 9th in which Mrs. A--, a correspondent of his, saw something over the South-Eastern part of Florida. Mr. Buggy's comments regarding the sighter are:

'The letter is from her father, who is a personal friend and co-worker of Joan's. He stated that Joan's father has never shown much interest in flying saucers or anything pertaining to CRIFO. He believes she is a very bright student in school and has always been very serious minded. Mr. Fort has never known for her to play tricks or perpetrate a hoax.'

Following is Joan's letter to CRIFO, dated June 10: 'I received your letter of May 30 inquiring about my "saucer" experience. I will try to give you the details as accurately as I can remember. On May 9th my girl friend and I did go to the drugstore for some soft drinks. As we were leaving the drugstore, I happened to look up into the sky. At first I didn't pay much attention, but then I realized that what I was seeing was not an ordinary plane, but appeared to be a tremendous bright light, hovering above the tree-tops. It seemed to be oscillating from side to side and changing colors, going from brilliant red to brilliant white and back again. It was making a slight humming sound. As I watched it, it suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared. The whole incident did not last more than a minute or two. 

'I do not believe the newspapers recorded the sighting. I have not seen any reports of it in the papers. It was very dark and I am sure that there were no other light sources around to account for what we saw. There were no other people around at the time that I noticed. We were the only two to see the object. I actually thought at first that my eyes were playing tricks on me, but I am sure now that what I saw was real and not imaginary. I am still puzzled as to what it could have been. It seemed to be surrounded by a sort of halo or aura of light and the changing colors were most unusual. I would be interested to know if anyone else in the area reported seeing the same thing on that night.'

I do not believe that there is any indication that the sighting was a hoax or misidentification. The witness appears to be a serious, honest and reliable person. The object described is consistent with many other sightings of UFOs, including the oscillating motion, color changes and rapid speed. I would rate this sighting as 'unknown' unless further information comes to light.

9 May 1956
Glen Ellyn, Illinois

UFO Rept
Mrs. C., aged 30 or so, informed that she observed an object in the air of a bright reddish-purple color and about the size of a golf ball. It remained stationary for a few minutes, then began moving off to the northeast. After some 30 to 40 seconds, it simply disappeared and vanished from sight. It was cloudy and she had a good clear view of this object. No sound was heard. I had a talk with this woman, and she impressed me as being sincere and reporting accurately what she saw. She could give no explanation for what she observed.

SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH

UFO SIGHTED BY PROSPECTORS
Case 161-56 Salt Lake City, Utah, May 10, 1956-
Two prospectors reported seeing an unidentified object which they say "lit up the sky over Public and the Great Salt Lake." On May 12, the Desert News and Telegram reported that the sighting occurred about 7 PM that night "while working in the air in the western part of Millard County, from near Toppin. Robin
Langston and Mr. Sittner, and their son Don, all of Toppin, stated that they were staring at an unidentified object which suddenly lit up the sky like daylight."
One of the prospectors, "I had a pair of 8X30 binoculars with me and looked at the object through them. The object looked 'like the bottom of a saucer' except that it was slippery rather than entirely round. It was the brightest silvery thing I have ever seen," said Langston.
The object remained stationary for about 2 minutes and then disappeared out of sight. A strong wind was blowing in the incline to the west and continued for about 74 degrees angle and disappeared out of sight. A strong wind was blowing in the incline to the west and continued for about 74 degrees angle and disappeared out of sight. A strange object was reported. Said Langston: "This makes me certain that it was not a balloon." There was nothing hanging down from the bottom, either. The men reported that they were about 2,000 ft. high and that the object was about 3,500 feet.

CANADA

Case #59, Ottawa, Canada, May 15, 1956 - We are advised this incident is number 59. It possibly involves a "UFO", but because it may typify certain cases we are omitting the time, duration, and other details except as they may pertain to the Canadian government's interest (or the cover-up, but feel that CIRKO readers should be provided with sufficient data to evaluate all reports) for the record from the Cincinnati Enquirer as follows: "The U.S. Air Force ministry said a false alarm for sending up jet planes was created when a sighting was reported by radar but not immediately identified. Before the interception was carried through, the "unknown" objects as an Air Force transport returning from the Arctic." The jets met the transport at very high altitudes, said the RCAF, and after further identification, were called off. There were other bases and some damage, and to use up excess fuel that might have endangered the landing, Canmore said the planes just fell. There has been no indication of trouble. All evidence points to the likelihood of satisfactory explanation in a major five from a very high altitude," he said. "It looks like just a routine mission to the Arctic."

18 May 1956
El Cajon Valley, California

By 2:35 a.m. F.C., a 24 year old valley resident, was awakened by a strange sound and observed a bright light outside. He went outside to investigate and observed a very bright light, about 100 feet in diameter, hovering about 50 feet above the ground. It appeared to be elliptical in shape and had a white color. The light was blinding to look at. The object made a whirring sound and appeared to rotate. It moved rapidly to the north and streaked out of sight. The witness was somewhat frightened by the experience. He stated that there was no exhaust or trail that he could see and it made no sound when it streaked away.
