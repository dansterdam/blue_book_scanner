At a neighborhood of 20,000 feet. The object was very brilliant and easy to keep in view. The airman's object was what appeared aircraft.

No Case (Information Only)                                9 May 1956
                                                Jacksonville, Florida

SAUCER DESCENDS ON DARK STREET

Case no., Jacksonville, Florida May 9, 1956—
This weird story first reaches us by letter from Richard Seachera of Buffalo, N.Y. We believe the incident, being unusual, deserves full review and thus will quote from Seachera's comments regarding the sighter; the sighter's letter to her father (quoted by Seachera) and finally a letter received by CRIFO from the sighter whose name is Joan Frost, then residing in Jacksonville. A co-worker was Miss Gertie Wynn of Jacksonville, following Joan's letter to her father:

Something happened to my girl friend, Gertie and me last night after we left the bus at Jacksonville. We were on a dance on the street in Jacksonville by bus. We didn't like it there so we left at 8:45. We were waiting for the bus to go home on this small side street. There was no one around and not too many houses and no cars. We walked until 11:00 or later, and this is what happened.

We looked up and saw two stars moving very high. They were moving in an odd way at a terrific rate of speed. We thought at first they were falling stars except they didn't fall. But went out of sight a minute later; they came back and went up into the sky. I can see over town as the object rose up over us. It was round and red and had three lights on it. I started to run down the street and Gertie just stood staring. The two objects started up and the other just came out. The two objects started moving slowly. After a few people on the bus and those around us watched the objects go for about ten minutes. The driver said they couldn't be jets because they were too high and would have heard the jet engines. We knew they weren't planes or helicopters. Whatever they were, they saw us standing there. After a while they looked like two hooks on flying saucers and are hanging to study them.

Joan's father is a personal friend and co-worker of Richard Seachera. Comments Seachera: "His daughter had never shown much interest in anything pertaining to UFOs. She was a four-year honor student in high school and always very serious minded. Mr. Frost has never known her to play tricks or perpetrate a hoax."

Following is Joan's letter to CRIFO, dated June 10: "I received a letter from you on May 25 inquiring about my 'saucer' experience. I am sorry I did not reply sooner, but I was on the process of preparing to come home here to Buffalo. My girl friend and I did not speak to anyone else of this incident, and as far as I know, I do not believe the newspaper records the sighting. I have no idea of what size the object was as I was very dark, and there was no street light in that area. I was approximately a distance of three telephone poles above us or maybe four. There are no sound waves and no aerial anything. However the area was very still and if an odor was present it very likely could have been carried from us. The door or the bottom appeared to be like a bomb bay shaped in a long square with only three cracks visible. As it came down toward us, but when it was the sky, it appeared to have three white lights which were pulsating. However, as it tipped downward and hovered above us, I seemed to be surrounded by a red mist of light. This is my first time I thought it was a red hot falling star, but then realized that even though it was a descending object, a terrific speed, a star or meteor would drop even faster. I do not know any way of computing the passage of the bus or their speed to make any comparison. I am writing to the Jacksonville, Ga. and the driver was open to seeing the Lake Shore saucer on May 9th. You also asked me what kind of object came out of the pattern. This I do not know because when it left, it went very high and looked identical. We didn't say anything to anyone because we are young and felt people would just say we were making up a nice big story. I didn't write to my dad though because he knows what I am capable of and wouldn't relate anything that wasn't a reality. I didn't know there was such an organization as yours in existence but I think it is a wonderful thing."

UFO ITEM

May 9-Glen Ellyn, Ill. ---- A reporter sent to the home of a man about fifty p.m. shortly after an electrical store. "I stopped out," he relates. "There against the sky, way above the tree tops, came a willingly illuminated object, larger than any plane. I stared fascinated, for I had never seen such a thing before. Just hovering, and waiting to move. It was called by company to move quickly. No watched it for several moments, then it moved slowly north, and suddenly disappeared. No further distant, moved north and disappeared in like fashion. Definitely intelligently controlled craft." (Go File.)

UFO SIGHTED BY PROSPECTORS

Case 161, Salt Lake City, Utah, May 10, 1956.—Even Jula are not full-proof as witnessed by the time and geographical proximity sightings over Pueblo and the Great Salt Lake. On May 12, the Desert News and Telegram reported that three uranium prospectors saw a large silvery colored object "spinning or floating" in the air in the western part of Millard County, from atop Totem Knob.

"We were searching with binoculars near the top when one of the prospectors "I had a pair of 8x50 binoculars with me and looked at the object through them. It was no light reflection, absolutely not," he said.

The object looked "like the bottom of a saucer except that it was elliptical rather than entirely round. It was the brightest silvery thing I have ever seen," said [redacted]. 

The object remained stationary below some light fleecy clouds for about four minutes and then rose at about 7.5 degrees angle and disappeared out of sight. A strong wind was blowing the clouds to the west and the object went out of sight in the opposite direction, he reported. Said [redacted], "This makes us certain that it was not a balloon. There was nothing hanging down from the bottom either." The men reported that they were about 8,000 ft. high and that the object was about 3,000 feet above them.

No Case (Information Only)                15 May 1956
Canada

Case 158, Ottawa, Canada, May 15, 1956—We assigned this incident a number not because it arbitrarily involves a UFO, but because it may typically case-number the true facts and will aid in a write-up with security. For this we do not blame the Canadian government for the cover-up, but feel that CIRPO readers should be prodded into evaluating all reports describing obscure aerial activities. We quote for the record from the Cincinnati Enquirer as follows: "The defense ministry blamed a false alarm for sending up the jet plane that crashed into a nun's rest home and killed 15 persons.

Ralph Campney, minister of defense, said the plane was one of two jets ordered to take off to intercept a plane sport raiding through an unidentified location. Before the interception was carried through, the 'enemy' plane was identified through flight plans as an Air Force transport returning from the Arctic. The jets met the transport at 7000 feet. They then went up to 33,000 feet to practice intercept tactics—a normal procedure to give pilots practice and to use up excess fuel that might endanger a safe landing. Campney said the plane that fell had given no indication of trouble. 'All evidence points to the likelihood it descended in a steep dive from a very high altitude,' he said..."

By 16 El Cajon Valley, Calif. - El Cajon police revealed six men who saw a bright ball of light traveling from east to west about 7:35 p.m. last night and described it first as nearly as bright as the first magnitude star, bright ball of light. It was hard to describe, but it moved about 5 or 6 miles a minute, it was seen over Fletcher Hills. Mr. [illegible text] said, "It was one the north and slightly west. It disappeared, as I ran to the corner to look, it was gone slowly. It was a bright iridescent glow." And to describe: "It disappeared the second time north of Black Mountain. Added Francis McCormic. "I heard the commotion across the street and ran out. came into the street about 8, an amateur astronomer," said, "The object was somewhat like a big a 1/2 to 2 miles long." Later I saw several jets come over the Valley and follow the same flight pattern. I was told by a man who claimed to have described it. "Later, while driving to town we saw the thing again. The first not over than 300 feet off the ground. It disappeared in Fletcher Hills. We went up there and talked to some people." (a Cajon Valley News, May 20)
