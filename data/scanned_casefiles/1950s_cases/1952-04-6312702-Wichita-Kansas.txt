Description of Object: Color yellow - like that of ordinary incandescence. 
Metallic surface - clear and bright against dark sky and apparently close, 
approximately 1,500'. Light source did not twinkle like a star. The top 
end tapered and disappeared with midcourse as though turned on and off by an 
observer. Shape was of an opinion of the observer that it was a portion 
of a geometric outline comparable to that of a long round cylindrical curve. 
The curved section being more pronounced in the first half of the "round", 
of width to length of band approximately 1:15. Intensity of light in "beam" 
or combustion type engine - no appearance of flames - no discoloration. Recession 
of speed 250 to 500 miles per hour - impression of height, approximately 5000'.

Time of Sighting: First appearance about 2245 but not before 2242 and not after 
2252; light exposed about 1.5 seconds. Second appearance one minute after first, 
light exposed about 1.5 seconds.

Manner of Observations: Visually from the ground. No optical or electronic 
equipment used.

Location of Observer: The observer was located at 37° 15'N - 37° 48'N. Altitude 
of object approximately 500', distance 1,000', and was headed in SSE direction.

Identifying Information of Observer: The observer is a graduate Aeronautical 
Engineer, Class 1942 with considerable experience in aircraft maintenance, the 
second sighting was noted simultaneously by Mrs. Bloomfield.

Atmospheric Conditions: Clear - stars - no moon (moon visible in Wichita 20 
miles SW) - wind velocity East 12 miles per hour, light.

Meteorological Conditions: There were no indications of any meteorological 
conditions or activity at this time which might account for sighting.

Persistence of Physical Evidence: There is not physical evidence of sighting much 
in area.

Interpretation or Identification Action Taken: None

Position of Air Traffic in General Area: There was no air traffic noted by 
observer.

This report was not sent by electrical means since too much time and 
elapsed between the sighting and the receipt of the report by this office.

Comments of Preparing Officers:
The source is considered to be well qualified, is a graduate Aeronautical 
Engineer and has been in the aircraft industry since 1929. The source's 
observations were well documented. The only significance of this observation 
is the existence of it. It is considered as too fragmentary to actually make 
much by itself, but may fit a pattern of near-complete investigation.

Report on a Flying Object Observed Twice April 15, 1952

FIRST APPEARANCE

1. Time: About 10:45 PM but not before 10:42 PM and not after 10:52 PM.

2. Atmospheric Conditions: Clear - stars - no moon (moon visible in Wichita 20 minutes after midnight - wind velocity East 12 miles per hour, Ref: Wichita Weather Bureau). Sky very dark.

3. Location of Object: In field of view of observer engaged in conversation - position of head normal - but to center the object in field of view, observer had to slightly raise head. Object appeared above flat roofed residence at 400 North Belmont and was viewed from sidewalk adjacent to that residence.

4. Position of Observer: Approx. 50 ft. south from north line of property 400 North Belmont.

5. Direction of Flight: SSE.

SECOND APPEARANCE

1. Time: Approx. one minute after first appearance.

2. Location of Object: In field of view of observer engaged in conversation - position of head normal - but to center the object in field of view, observer had to slightly raise head. Object appeared over residences located on west side of North Belmont.

3. Position of Observer: Approx. 100 ft. south of position of first appearance.

4. Appearance: Color yellow - like that of ordinary incandescent electric source - clear and bright against dark sky and appearing close, approx. 1500 ft. Light source did not "twinkle" like a star - it did not seem a bright, large light far off. First impression of this observer was that of a round electric light source traveling at a very high rate of speed. This impression was conceived because of the "streak of light" appearance in the sky. This seems illogical, however, because the brightness of the "streak" did not diminish with the distance from the apparent light source. The top and bottom limits of the "streak" were parallel - not fanning out. The light appeared and disappeared with suddenness as though turned on and off by an electric switch - no gradual appearance and disappearance - no fading in and fading out. The "streak" appeared slightly curved, inviting the impression of a single point light source traveling along a curved course at a very high rate of speed.

5. Observation: It is the opinion of this observer that the light source was of a geometric outline comparable to that of a long "band" slightly curved.

Page 2

The curved section being more pronounced in the first half of the "band". Ratio of width to length of "band" approximately 1:15.
Intensity of light in "band" uniform - top and bottom limits parallel. No resemblance to exhaust from jet or combustion type engine - no appearance of flames - no discoloration. Impression of speed 200 to 300 miles per hour - impression of height, approximately 500 ft. Impression of distance, approximately 1500 ft. No noise noted.

6. Observer: [redacted], Wichita, Kansas - Age 45 President, Swallow Airplane Company - graduate Aeronautical Engineer - class 1929 - continuous aircraft experience since graduation.

Note 1: The second appearance was noted simultaneously by Mrs. Bloomfield and myself.

Note 2: The Wichita Evening Eagle of April 16, 1952 reports as follows: Mrs. [redacted] of Forest Drive, saw a strange, brilliantly lighted object in the heavens Tuesday night and she is wondering if any other Wichitans living in that area had made any "flying saucer" reports. Mrs. Rogers says the object streaked across the sky, to the southwest, in a matter of seconds. A vivid green in color, it had the appearance of a huge kite with a long tail. The woman said her husband tried to blame the incident on new glasses for which she was fitted Tuesday, but she insists she didn't have them at the time.

Note 3: In each of the two appearances I estimate the time light was exposed at 1.5 seconds.

Gentlemen:

I am writing you in regard to a UFO sighting my wife and I observed the night of April 15, 1952. This information may help to confirm other sightings on this date. I wrote a letter that night, but did not mail it. I hope this information will be of some help to you.

Following find information on observation:

1. Time 9:15-9:30 P.M. April 15, 1952
2. About seven dull orange lights flying in V formation one side of the V longer than other. The end light changed to opposite side of formation during observation.
3. Direction of flight south to north
4. Time travel about 70° (from 20° above horizon to overhead) 3 to 5 seconds
5. Height and distance unknown
6. Very high rate of speed
7. No noise that I could hear (my hearing is limited to about 3500 cycles per second)
8. Sighting was also observed by people in car next to us (we were at a drive in movie)
9. Clear night, no moon, no clouds

Truly yours,
