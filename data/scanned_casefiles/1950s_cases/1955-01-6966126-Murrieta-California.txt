UNCLASSIFIED

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

Flight Log: 4004 hrs.    AC Number: 4204

Location: Long Beach, California.

(Numbers and columns appear to be partially legible but too faint to accurately transcribe)

At the bottom and top of the document, the word "UNCLASSIFIED" is clearly visible.

The document appears to be a standard military flight log or record sheet with multiple columns, but the specific details are difficult to read due to the image quality.


- page 3 -

UNCLASSIFIED

[Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality and scanning. The only clearly readable text is "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom of the document.]

There appears to be a hand-drawn or sketched object in the lower portion of the page, which looks like a simplified drawing of an elongated shape, possibly representing a UFO or aircraft.
