STATEMENT

June 18, 1952

EXTRACT

On Saturday, 24 May, 1952, I was driving east on U.S. 66 about 25 miles west of Santa Rosa, New Mexico, with my wife as a passenger, when we both observed a round silver, shiny object in the sky. It seemed to be some ten to fifteen miles away, fairly high, and to the northeast of the highway. I assume it was fairly large in size, for I an sure that it was quite some distance away, yet it was clearly visible at all times, and easy to see. It seemed to hang motionless for a period of some minutes, then it started to move rapidly, and disappeared in the southeast, moving in that direction. My wife made these same observations. The time of this happening was about nine A.M. The sky was clear around the object, though there were clouds higher up.

------

I testify that the above statements are true and correct.
