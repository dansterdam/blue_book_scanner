STATEMENT

June 18, 1952

EXTRACT 

On Saturday, 24 May, 1952, I was driving east on U.S. 66 about 25 miles west of Santa Rosa, New Mexico, with my wife as a passenger, when we both observed a round silvery shiny object in the sky. It seemed to be moving very fast to the northeast, fairly high, and to the northeast of it was quite some distance away, yet it was clear to us that it was quite some distance away, yet it seemed to move rapidly, and disappeared in the southeast, moving away in that direction. My wife made these same observations, and I testify that the above statements are true and correct.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Unidentified Flying Object(s) Observed 15 July 1952
5 miles E. of Santa Rosa, new mexice 
1430 hour, 15 July 1952
Capt. E. J. Wagner, USAF
This reports that an unidentified object was observed from the ground at 0900 LST on 15 July 1952, near Santa Rosa, New Mexico. The object was traveling west on U.S. Highway 66, and was observed for approximately 15 minutes. The object was described as being elliptical in shape, and appeared to be about 50-60 feet long. It gave off no exhaust or trail of any kind, and appeared to be a self-luminous body emitting a white light. The object disappeared from view when it appeared to go off into the distance and disappear. There were a few civilians who also observed the object, and they corroborated the sighting.
