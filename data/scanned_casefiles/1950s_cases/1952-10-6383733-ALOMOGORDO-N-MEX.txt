STATEMENT

On 7 October 1952 at 2030 hours, in the Starlight Drive-In Theatre my wife called my attention to a light that appeared to be in the sky through our windshield. It looked oval in shape, the major axis being almost vertical, and about a third of a thumbs length in height, the hand being held out at arm length. It was lighter on the right edge and top than it was in the center and left side and seemed to be whitish or pale blue in color. I saw it in a direction a little bit north or northwest, judging the azimuth from the position of the north star. It traveled in a straight line at the same elevation, about 20 degrees above the horizon, from west to cast and suddenly seemed to get dimmer and fade out when it was almost north of us. It traversed about a thirty degree arc in four to five seconds before it went out. The impression I had was that it turned on its vertical axis and got dimmer, but not smaller in height, until it was out, all in a very short length of time, but this was an after impression and could easily have been imagination. It was not possible to estimate the actual size, altitude or distance of the object. The first thought was that it was a searchlight, but the sky appeared clear and we could see no beam. The second thought was a reflection off the windshield. Although I leaned over the wheel close to the windshield to get a better look and didn't notice that it was a reflection, my wife and I both saw it through the same pane and in about the same position.
