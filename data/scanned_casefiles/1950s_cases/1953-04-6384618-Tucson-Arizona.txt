10. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Four reddish-orange objects traveling at a high rate of speed
and at a high altitude were observed at the intervals. Length
of each sighting was 3 min. In 3 min. 3 or 4 scenes. Source also stated that objects appeared to be flickering, and
each object side a 250 deg. turn. Portion of duration on inbound
via out-of-motion not included. Statement that path not
erratic assumes constant speed.

Personal Interrogation of Witness

On 15 April 1953, four separate sightings were made of unidentified bright lights. All sightings were made in the 311° N 578' 1' between 2145 to 2220. Twice the lights were observed heading in a direction from north to south and then turning to a northwest heading and disappearing. The observer estimated the sightings to be at an extremely high altitude. The only known aerial activity was a C-46 aircraft departing Davis-Monthan Air Force Base at 2159 for Travis Air Force Base, California.

Headquarters 36th Air Division
Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Ariz.

1. On the night of 15 April 1953, four unidentified sightings of lights over
Tucson, Arizona, were observed and reported.

a. The first sighting was orange-red, predominating color was orange.
It was first sighted coming from the north on a heading of south then making a
right turn to a northwesterly heading. The light appeared to be a slow down taking
the turn to the northwest. It appeared to be at an extremely high altitude. The
path in definite and not erratic. No nearby aircraft features, trail propulsion
system, or sound were noted.

b. The second sighting also came from the north heading south. It
appeared similar, but brighter, and possibly lower than the first sighting. It
also turned to the northwest but had not proceeded as far south as the first sighting before it turned. The observer took three 15 second film exposures with a box
camera. Because of the speed of the film and short exposures the negatives were
blank when developed. The heading taken for such a flight would be northwest.

c. The observer suggested that the third sighting could have been a very
high speed aircraft. It was a blinking bluish lights, going at a very high rate of
speed in turn of about 180° then disappeared. The observer took another exposure
with his camera of 15 seconds which failed to show anything when developed.

d. The fourth sighting was orange and as bright as the second observation
and was seen on a northwest heading for a short time only.

2. a. Sighting #1 - 2145 - approximately three minutes duration.
b. Sighting #2 - 2200 - one minute duration.
c. Sighting #3 - 2207 - few seconds.
d. Sighting #4 - 2210 - thirty seconds duration.

3. Observations were all visual.

4. Location of observer was at 2957 East 17th Street, Tucson, Arizona,
coordinates 32° 12' North 110° 57' West.

5. The observer was S/Sgt [redacted], 358th Bomb Squadron,
3034 Bombardment Wing, Medium, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona.
Sergeant has three years experience as a radar observer and plotters in the
Navy and USAF. He has held the following HOSI's - 768, 510, and 514. Sergeant
has a good, clearly seen record of service and is a career airman. In the 24 years
of age and appears to have sound and reliable judgement. His observations were also
witnessed by his wife.

6. Tucson weather at 2130 was clear - 40/098/68/24/ - - - 8/992.

7. There was no known meteorological activity which may have caused this phenomenon.

8. Four photographs were taken of these sightings. Because of the slow speed of the film and short exposure time of 15 seconds the film was blank when developed.

9. No positive type of identification was made. (Evaluation F-2)
