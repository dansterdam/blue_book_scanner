AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det 1, 4602d AISS                 REPORT NO. D1-UFO8-1-57     AISS-UFO8-148-57     PAGE 7 OF 13

I. SOURCE: [redacted]
    Address: [redacted] Carmichael, California
    Age: 32
    Occupation: Truckdriver
    Education: High School
    Qualifications: Signalman in US Navy

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was described by neighbors (of [redacted] Way, Carmichael, Calif.) as constant, not very intelligent, steady nature, and not given to kidding or imaginative. Interviewers impression was that of below average intelligence, not critical. Fairly crossword, and reliable. Underground information of SOURCE from personal conversation indicates that he served approx 4 years in Navy, had one Captain's Mast, and one deck court martial for striking a commissioned officer, reached the rating of Signalman 3/c without technical schooling, served mostly on Destroyers.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE initially sighted UFO8, after being notified by Wm. Randall, Carmichael, Calif. at 20:37 Jun 57, at a magnetic bearing of 250 degrees, 20 degrees off the horizon. SOURCE described the UFO8 as being blinding white to naked eye. He went inside to get his binoculars (8X30 coated lens) and returned with his wife to view the UFO again. The UFO8 appeared through the binoculars as a light "sized" with red. Described as stationary at first, then through the binoculars while it was stationary. The total time it remained stationary was approx 10 minutes, at a distance of approximately one (1) mile from SOURCE.

No object then started moving toward SOURCE in a climb, reaching overhead in approx one (1) minute, then turned slightly to the left, and continued climbing until it went out of sight. While overhead, the object gave off a weird sound with a high frequency vibration. The sound was like that of an aircraft at first, then a rumble as it passed.

SOURCE could only hear the sound for 7 to 8 seconds while overhead, to be approximately 3000 feet, and the speed to be about 100 to 150 miles per hour. He estimated the size, while overhead, to be approx 50 feet long. At another estimation, he judged the size to be similar to a 2½ light. The appearance of the object was that of a triangular shape, with two lights that consisted of a point trailing the object. SOURCE insisted that the object was some kind of aircraft, and test personnel to the UFO8 are "unsure".

The object filled approx 1/6 of the binocular visual area while overhead. SOURCE stated that he thought the object had one white light dimmer than the other two, located in the tail of the object, and near the two side lights, and sometimes mistook a yellow light for red light, or vice-versa. His wife also viewed the object through the binoculars, and at various times, and at elevation of 75 degrees from the horizon.

    Address: [redacted], Carmichael, California
    Age: 33
    Occupation: Medical assistant
    Education: High School
    Qualifications: None

II. PRELIMINARY: SOURCE was described by [redacted] and having a great imagination.
Carmichael, Calif., an extremely nervous, volatile and somewhat excitable person.
He stated that her descriptions would include the following: "Fantastic, unbelievable
and out of this world." Interviewer's notes: SOURCE spends most of the time, extremely nervous and excitable.
With a very positive, stubborn and nervous person, interviewer's position was that of a very positive, stubborn but not nervous person.

III. SOURCE initially sighted the UFOB after being awakened by neighbor calling
her husband, at bearing of 20 degrees magnetic, and 10 degrees off the horizon,
at 2107'25" on 57. Appeared to be a very bright white light with the naked eyes.
Shortly after sighting, SOURCE was able to see an angle of 35 degrees off the horizon
with a very public area. SOURCE had no idea of the time, but stated that her
husband had told her to come to the conclusion. Before it started riding, the object
changed direction after reaching altitude, and started moving on a course of
approximately 10 degrees magnetic. Locally the area sighting, until it disappeared,
was at the triangles, and a red light on the trailing points of the triangles.
The size was judged to be 4 to 5 inches long, and the dimensions gave the impres-
sion of immense largeness. SOURCE could not judge the altitude. The object gave
off a sound similar to an earth-tone hum. For SOURCE, it was convincing evidence
that was able to see as here. The vibration it gave off was of the same frequency
as jet leave missing overhead. SOURCE stated positively the width was twice the
length. The number of the object was described as nonreflective, and the same
tone as the sky, but blocking out the sky. The object covered 1/3 of the binocular
visual area.

IV. Previous sightings: None

Date 1, 4602d AISS                                   DL-UFOB-11-57     Part Eight
                                                      AISS-UFOB-148-57  PAGE   12   OF   13   PAGES

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that the sighting was probably that of a Navy aircraft making GCI controlled intercepts for the following reasons:

a. The Navy fighters were at all positions in the vicinity of the sighting and at the altitude specified in it. Henderson's report, 22,000 feet. It is necessary for one aircraft to fly in a straight line, with no change in altitude, approximately 10 to 15 minutes, in order for GCI to direct a successful intercept. Due to the capability of the radar on the Navy fighters, "Overlay" has a standing order for all Navy fighters on GCI controlled intercepts at night, to turn on their landing lights for a positive identification of the "tail". This information was obtained from Captain James E. Sullivan, Direction Center Chief, 666th ACCS, Mather AFB, California.

b. Noting all the individual sightings to be of the same reliability, the following appears to be a reasonable compilation, as compared with the known facts of the Navy fighter:

                    UFOB                    NAVY
Time of sight       240702Z June 57         From 240655Z June to 241302Z June
Time in sight       Thirty (30) minutes     10 to 15 minutes with lights as target
Shape               Apearnt triangular      Apparent triangular
Size                100 feet wide           Unknown
Lights              Two white in center     Two landing lights, navigation lights
                    one red on left
Altitude            7,000 feet (average)    22,000 feet
                    20,000 feet stated      
                    in Part I
Speed               300 knots               Unknown
Sound               From wing to engine     Jet engine noise
                    noise

The above assumes all sightings to be of the same reliability, however, the time in sight of the UFOB varied from 10 to 60 minutes, and the altitude from 3,000 feet to 20,000 feet. For example, the altitude could be triangular, as at the UFOB, the edges of the object were not discernible, and the shape was taken from the lights.

c. The smoke blast was fired too late to be visible.

d. The track of the balloon launched at Vernalis NAS is not available to this detachment, with the fact known was no lights on the balloon, and the fact that it was launched approximately four (4) hours after sighting.

e. Possibly, the UFOB was an acft over Sacramento, except for the lights.

Unidentified Flying Object

SUMMARY
At 2407932 six (6) persons saw a bright yellowish-white light little off the horizon about tree top level from their residence. After 20 minutes of observation a binocular was obtained. For better sighting. Few minutes later the object climbed straight up and took a 45° north-east course after gaining high altitude and disappeared at about 20,200 feet. Total observation time is about 30 minutes. Later the party of six saw a couple more similar objects from a drive-in theatre a mile and one-half away. They exchanged notes. The object was triangular shape. A few claimed they saw a red light on the left forward and orange light in the rear, and possibly green on the right forward.

In 16mm Blinds. Bright yellowish-white light was outstanding throughout. Heard steady "humming" sound. Speed: Vertical was 500 knots and Diagonal was about 130-250 knots.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
Eight (3) people saw an unidentified flying object. They were uncertain what they actually saw, but knew it was something they had never seen before. None of the description above fits any of our known aircraft.

light low but approximately 200 degrees from magnetic north, an approximately 
10 degrees east of the horizon. After a few minutes, a pair of binoculars was 
obtained for better viewing. After approximately ten (10) minutes, the light 
moved vertically to approximately 45 degrees off the horizon. With a slight 
rotation, the light then started toward the northwest in a northwesterly 
direction. As the light passed overhead, the observers judged it to be 
approximately 7,000 feet high, but not very wide, traveling at a speed of 300 knots, 
with little shape, with no particular light, with no dim red light on the right, 
and one dim red light on the left side of the object. Some observers heard a 
sound described as a hum, rumble, aircraft, or undefined.

       Address:                   Carmichael, California
       Age:    24
       Occupation:    1st Lt. Navigator - Pilot 665th
                      USAF, Sq, Cal Nat Air Force Base, California
       Location:      High School, 2 years College, Aviation Cadet
       Militant:      Qualified navigator - GCA 11

II.   ESTIMATE:    Maj. Jerry J. Johnson, Fit Commander, 665th AACS Sq,
       well known California, describes SOURCE as factual, a fully qualified
       navigator, very factual, not given to exaggeration, quiet, and of a high
       caliber. He judged SOURCE to be above the average officer with same rank and
       status. An interview, Sacramento, California, describes SOURCE
       as having above average intelligence, very reliable and quiet. Interviewer's
       impression is that of an average officer, having an average imagination, not
       excitable, stable, and calm.

III.  SOURCE initially sighted the "UFO" at 2407N, 36 June 1957 through the window
       of his neighbors home at                , Carmichael, California, at the
       insistence of his wife. After going outside to better observe, he judged the
       object to be a solid white light, appearing stationary at an angle of 220 degrees
       from true north, as taken from the star Polaris, at an elevation of 10 degrees
       off the horizon. The object was approximately five blocks away, and had the same
       intensity as an automobile light one block away. The object remained stationary,
       with unvarying intensity for approximately 7-8 minutes. After initial sighting,
       then rose vertically to approximately 20,000 feet in approximately one minute.
       "With no hesitation, it moved north easterly on a course of 60 degrees from true
       north. In this movement, the object was slightly overhead, and continued in a
       straight line, with diminishing intensity, until it faded from sight at an angle of
       045 degrees from the horizon. The object took a recorded 30 to 50 minutes to
       complete its horizontal movement." SOURCE stated that the UFO, after reaching
       maximum altitude, appeared to separate into two lights, or balls, which cast no
       discernible beams or rays. The two stationary lights, however, were circular
       though binoculars, but also denied looking through them. The object had two
       lights located in the center of the object, which were white, and one dim red
       light on the left portion of the object, with one dim white light on the tail.
       The triangle traveled with the point at the                 and judged the speed to be approx.
       300 knots, and the distance a few miles. While the object was overhead, a
       humming sound was detected while the object was overhead.

II. RELIABILITY: Was described the SOURCE as fairly intelligent, not nervous or excitable, not imaginative, and a reliable. Interviewer's impression was that of a woman possessing no particularly outstanding traits, either good or bad. Interviewer judges SOURCE as having undetermined reliability.

III. SOURCE initially observed the USOB in her home at approximately 2400CZ
Jun 57, in it was pointed out to her by two men playing bridge. SOURCE and friends went outside to get a better look, and judged the object to be at 220 degrees magnetic bearing, 10 degrees above the horizon. The object was described as a pulsating, white very bright light. The object started to rise slowly, turning slightly to the left. It rose for approximately one mile to make bearing of 10°, 35° off the horizon. It took approximately 2 seconds to travel to this point, then hesitated for approx 5 seconds, and proceeded in a North easterly heading, gradually losing altitude. As it passed overhead, SOURCE saw three yellow-whites forming a triangle, and heard a humming noise. SOURCE declined to estimate the speed, altitude, or size of the USOB. SOURCE stated that the object left no trails of any type, and the no vibration was associated with it. It continued on this course until it went out of sight, after 10 minutes of travel, at approx 10 degrees from a granite rock, and 25 degrees above the horizon.

    Occupation: Transmission Van with Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co.
    Education: High School - Fire Control School USN
    Qualifications: Fire Controller and tracker

II. RELIABILITY:
    SOURCE as the most calm, methodical man in entire neighborhood. He stated that
    when SOURCE's house burned down, SOURCE was the most calm around. Interviewers
    impression: SOURCE appeared to be of average intelligence, extremely calm and
    dispassionate, methodical, and factual.

III. SOURCE initially sighted UFOB at 240701Z Jun 57, after leaving the bridge
    came attended by Lt. and Mrs [redacted], Carmichael, Calif and
    SOURCE's wife, at the insistence of Mrs [redacted] who said she saw something outside.
    UFOB was first sighted at a magnetic bearing of 220 degrees, 10 degrees of the horizon.
    The object remained stationary at this position for approx 10 minutes. SOURCE first
    noticed the object to be an aircraft with the landing lights on, but after object did
    not move, did not know what it was. The object appeared to be a bright pulsating
    light while stationary. After object started moving, it travelled vertically to
    approx 12,000 feet, in approx one minute, to a point 70 degrees above the horizon.
    SOURCE stated, after object reached its peak, there was nothing unusual about it.
    It looked like an aircraft with its landing lights on and one red light anchoring
    on the left wing tip. The object started moving in a heading of 45 degrees from the
    magnetic pole, with all lights burning steady. It traveled for approx three (3)
    minutes, then faded out of sight, 70 degrees above the horizon. As the object passed
    overhead, the red light disappeared. When the object reached overhead, SOURCE could
    distinctly hear the sound of a roar and engines. There was no vibration. SOURCE
    estimated the speed of the UFOB as 200 miles per hour, and the distance when first
    sighted as 4500 feet.
