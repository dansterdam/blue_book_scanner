AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
CASE NO. D1-U-209-247

DATE 2 1 1957 
I. SOURCE: Carmichael, California
Address: 
Age: 32
Occupation: Truckdriver
Education: High school
Qualifications: Signalman in U.S. Navy
II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: The source was described by neighbors (residents of Carmichael, Calif.) as "extremely reliable and creditable person, who is dependable in every way, and in no way given to imagination or wild fantasy."
Interviewers' impression was that the aboveaverage intelligence, not critical, had an honest manner, and her story presented in a straight forward way. She had no prior interest or experience in the UFO phenomena.
III. SUMMARY OF INFORMATION REPORT: The source was driving his truck on the evening of 6 June 1957 at approximately 10:40 PM on Route 80 near Carmichael, California. He noticed a bright light in the sky which first appeared to be an extremely bright stationary star. After observing it for about one minute, the light commenced a series of maneuvers, moving rapidly from side to side, up and down, and back and forth, ending up directly overhead the observer. After these gyrations, which continued for about 2-3 minutes, the object took off at an incredibly high rate of speed and disappeared from sight within approximately 15 seconds. The source stated that the maneuvers were "just dazzling" and that the object seemed to be about 1/2 mile in diameter. No noise was heard, no smoke or exhaust trail was visible, and the object was completely silent. The source used his truck lights, parking lights, and a flash light in an attempt to follow or guide the object, but these had no noticeable effect. The source stated that he has no interest in or prior experience with UFO's and that he was completely shaken up by this incident. He stated that he had seen many "strange things" but never anything like this before.

Temperature: 56 degrees
Humidity: 45%
Winds: Ground - from East at 5 (?) knots

Here is the text from the document:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE: 1 
LOCATION: CARMICHAEL, CALIFORNIA
AGENCY: UNIDENTIFIED

1. The opinion of the reporting officer is that the sighting was probably that of a natural phenomenon, possibly due to the following:
a. The thirty flight members were at all attitudes specified in it. Nordman's was very high, 20,000 feet. It is concluded that two or more aircraft were at various altitudes, which might account for the variable altitudes report.
b. Due to the capability of the radar on the Navy ships, it seems highly probable that the lights were not actual objects, but reflected light, possibly from the surface of the water, which would account for the variable altitude. There was no attempt made to turn on a landing light for a positive identification during the "fall out" phase of the observation.
Center chief, Scott AFB, Northern Area, Carmichael, California.

2. It is believed that due to the number of reliable witnesses reporting these sightings, they are of the same reliability. However, the timeframe precludes accurate analysis and positive identification as a known phenomenon.

TIME OF SIGHTING: 2247Z - 2315Z 
DATE OF SIGHTING: June 27

SHAPE: Apparent triangular
SIZE: 100 feet wide
LIGHTS: Two white in center, one red on left
ALTITUDE: 63,000 feet (average), 20,000 feet (minimum)
SPEED: 330 knots
SOUND: Jet engine noise

The above appears to be all the pertinent details of the sighting, except for the fact that the time of the sighting varied from 2245Z to 2315Z, an interval of 30 minutes, which may account for the variable altitude from 63,000 feet to 20,000 feet. The shape, size, and other details appear to be generally consistent throughout the observation.

In general, the track of the balloon launches at Vandenberg AFB is not available to this statement, with the fact that there were some lights on the balloon, and the fact that the USAF was an act over Cape Canaveral, except for the last paragraph.

DATE OF OBSERVATION: 6/25/57
DATE OF COLLECTION: 6/27/57
DATE OF REPORT: 6/27/57
SUMMARY: At approximately 2207 hours, 6 persons saw a bright yellowish-white light little off the horizon and moving about very slowly. After 20 minutes or observation, a telescope was obtained for better sighting. The light was sometimes obscured by trees, but appeared to be about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. There were no other lights visible, and the object was described as silent. It maintained approximately the same position for about 30 minutes. Later the group of 6 persons was joined by a couple who also saw the object. They described it as looking almost like a red light or the tail end of an airliner. Speeds variable was 300 knots and diagonal.
COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER: Right (2) people saw an unidentified flying object. They were uncertain what they were seeing, but knew it was something they had not seen before. Some description shows this may of our known aircraft.

II. DETAILS: Mrs. M. described the SOURCE as fairly intelligent, not particularly outstanding, and not possessing any outstanding mental or physical capability. However, her interest is quite real and apparently stems from a religious conviction.
III. SOURCE initially observed the UFO in her home at approximately 2407000Z Jun 27. She noticed the object appear to her side, about 75 feet away and 40 feet above the ground. The object was yellowish and cigar-shaped, estimated to be 30 to 40 feet long and 20 to 25 feet in diameter. It was moving slowly, turning slightly as it traveled. SOURCE observed it for approximately one minute, heading gradually towards a northerly direction. As it passed overhead, SOURCE saw three yellow lights on the underside of the object, which gradually became dimmer and then disappeared. SOURCE believes she saw vapor trails or some sort of exhaust from the rear of the object during its flight.
IV. PHYSICAL SIGHTINGS: None.
