STATEMENT

"On 29th of May 1952, climbing to 3,550 feet, enroute to Ashina Range, on a heading of 190 degrees, at approximately 1925 hours, the co-pilot of my crew remarked that he saw an old shape in the sky at about 4 o'clock.

"I was flying the aircraft and raised up out of the left seat to get a look at what the co-pilot referred to.. To me, it looked like nothing more than a dark cloud, round and towering. It was approximately 60 to 70 miles from us reaching to about 15,000 feet.

"Since I was satisfied that is was only another cloud formation, I did not deem it necessary to contact a GCI station and busied myself with flying duties.

"I have enclosed a sketch of phenomena observed."

"I hereby certify that I have made the above statement, which I have read for accuracy, in the 61st Troop Carrier Group Intelligence Office, APO 704, this 7th day of June 1952."

"Aboard aircraft #42-724,52A on 30 May at approximately 1930 hours on a course of 180 degrees our altitude was 8,500 feet, and we were approaching the China Range.

"The co-pilot, Captain Leete, first sighted, and called to the attention of the pilot, 1st Lt Arblaster, first and engineer, T/Sgt Roe, an object at three o'clock, and a little high, maybe 10,000 feet, to be confirmed. We each scanned that it was an unidentified object, and we estimated that it was about 30 or 40 miles away. It's position was in the center of a saddle-back type cloud formation that extended to 20,000 feet, as reported by Base Meteorology Section.

"We continued to observe the object for about seven minutes which was apparently hovering. Upon reaching our course of 270 degrees, and at-that time the object began to move at a fast rate of speed completely disappearing in less than a minute.

"It appeared to me as a round dark shape with a short tail as the only break in the outline which was clear in definition."

"I, T/Sgt Andrew J. Roe, AF L4056905, hereby affirm that I made the above statement, which I have re-read for accuracy of facts, in the Intelligence Office of the Gist Troop Carrier Group, Heavy, APO 704, on this 4th day of June, 1952.

STATEMENT

"At 1855, 30 May 1952, we took off from Tachikawa Air Base on a Troop Carrier trip in G-54 #2452. I was co-pilot on the crew. We climbed on course to Oshima to 8,500 feet, on a magnetic heading of about 130 degrees and at a rate of about 530 feet per minute. Our indicated airspeed was 150 - 160 MPH.

"From time to time after take-off and after climbing a few minutes I glanced toward the west observing the effect of the sunset behind the cloud formations. I noticed what at first appeared to be a round black cloud detached from the rest of the formation and in a sort of trough in the contour of the clouds. After watching this for about one minute, I noted that my watch read 1908 hours, as I decided by this time that the object was not a cloud nor did it seem to be any type of aircraft or helicopter.

"I called the attention of the aircraft commander, the engineer and navigator, who was not on the crew but was in the navigator's compartment, to the object. The aircraft commander, 1st Lt Arblaster, was occupied piloting the plane and glanced only once at the object. The engineer looked at the object for a minute or two and remarked that it was not an aircraft nor a cloud. In his opinion, the navigator told me later when I questioned him, that he merely glanced at the object and thought it was a cloud.

"I observed the object until it disappeared from sight at 1914. It appeared darker than the clouds and of an almost circular shape but somewhat flattened on top and bottom. At some moments it seemed to wobble slightly. It hovered perfectly motionless from the time I first saw it at 1907 hours until 1913, when it started moving to the west out of sight at 1914.

"It seemed to move on a track away from our position and horizontally. I watched it until it became a mere speck and disappeared from view.

"I noticed another G-54 during the time I was watching the object. It was at a higher altitude than ours, about 10,000 feet and was to the northwest of our position headed in an easterly direction.

"The sky to the west was pink and the sun was not glaring. I did not observe any exhaust, flame or vapor trails around the object at any time. I am positive that the object was not an aircraft of any type I have ever seen. It was not a balloon and it was not a cloud.

"I could only guess at the altitude and distance of the object. I estimate it was about 20-25 miles west of my position and at 10,000-15,000 feet altitude.

"I, Captain William D. Leet, AO 127670, hereby certify that I did take the above statement of 30 May 1952, which I have prepared for accuracy, in the intelligence office 51st Troop Carrier Group Heavy, Air TDY, 15 Jun 52, 13 Jun 52."

The image is a hand-drawn sketch showing a dark oval-shaped object positioned between two large, detailed cloud formations. The clouds are drawn with shading and cross-hatching to give them depth and texture. The object appears to be floating or suspended in the sky, with horizontal lines behind it suggesting movement or atmospheric conditions.
