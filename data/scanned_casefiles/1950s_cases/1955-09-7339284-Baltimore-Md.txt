AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-H-4602d ATSS                                                PAGE    5   OF    8   PAGES

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORT: (Contd)

10. In an attempt to record the opinion of local astronomers, the investigator called Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, which was unable to offer assistance. The Baltimore division of the University of Maryland was then contacted, however the Observatory's astronomers were still on summer leave. Finally, the Director of the Maryland Academy of Sciences was called. The Director stated that to his knowledge nothing unusual in the way of astronomical bodies might meet the description of the phenomenon described. Neither the Director nor his chief astronomer had any explanation of the "blinking lights", except to suggest that they may have come from an aircraft.

11. A later check with the Baltimore Filter Center revealed that a Miss Jean Laughnan at the GCC Post in New Oxford, Pennsylvania (Geotler GJK 5653), had called the Filter Center at 0321z to report that she saw an object with blinking lights 11 glass cast of her post at flying toward York, Pa. (GeaRef GJK 156°). She observed the object through binoculars but could not distinguish shape other than flashing lights. She observed the object until 09/0321z when it failed from sight.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer                                              PROBABLE

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the UFCB sighting was probably caused by the blinking night lights from one or more of the Andrews AFB jets flying in the vicinity of Baltimore between the hours of 09/0230Z and 09/0315Z Sept 55.

a. The sequence of changing lights observed from the Glen Burnie GOC post of red to blue to white seems to bear a strong resemblance to the night lights of either an F-80 or an F-86 which blink from red to green to white. These aircraft were known to have been flying in the area reported on at the time of the sighting.

b. None of the evidence collected seems to discredit the possibility that the lights observed were those of aircraft in the vicinity:

(1) The operations reports from the 95th FIS at Andrews AFB, Md., have established the presence of aircraft in the vicinity of the UFCB.

(2) The Operations Officer, 647th AC & W Sq confirms the presence of jet aircraft and an F-80 in the skies above and to the west and northwest of Baltimore at the time of the sighting.

(3) The GOC observers did hear sounds of aircraft in the skies, while one observer noted aircraft sounds coming from beyond but in the same direction as the UFCB.

c. The following evidence indicates that the lights observed from the ground might not have been from an Unidentified Flying Object:

(1) That none of the pilots flying in the vicinity of Baltimore at the time of the sighting were able to offer any confirmation of the UFCB.

(2) The presence of radar confirmation on the Andrews aircraft and a lack of it with respect to the UFCB.

CHESTER B. HANSON
CAPTAIN    USAF
Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by the blinking night lights from one or more of the jet aircraft known to be in the vicinity of the sighting.

PART FOUR: Comments of Preparing Officer

II. SUMMARY: An unidentified flying object was reported to the Baltimore
Filter Center by a civilian GQ volunteer located in Glen Burnie, Maryland, at
09/0232 Sept 55. The object had first been seen by another observer at the
same post at 09/0018, apparently having caused no alarm. The UFOB was last
seen by GQ observers at 09/0318? Sept 55. The information contained in this
report is based on interviews with persons having visually observed the
UFOB in addition to the assistance of various agencies and installations within
the Baltimore-Washington area whose records enabled the investigator to estab-
lish the probable cause of the phenomenon observed.

Address: 127 Dorchester Road, Glen Burnie, Maryland
Age: 32
Occupation: 1st Lt, USAF, 4760th GCS, Baltimore, Maryland
Education: College
Qualifications: An Air Force Officer, alert, intelligent and possessing 20/20 vision.

II. RELIABILITY: Unknown. SOURCE was contacted by telephone.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was at his residence in Glen Burnie, Maryland, at 09/08/55 at 2355 when he noticed strange lights in the sky which seemed to be moving in a north-northwest direction at a moderate speed and an unknown altitude. He estimated object(s) at an angle of 40° with the horizon. Later, SOURCE estimated the distance between himself and the object to be approximately 5 miles, placing the object in the neighborhood of 20,000 feet. The object seemed neither to gain or lose altitude.

SOURCE recalled that no form or definite body shape was visible at any time during the sighting of the UFOB. There seemed to be only a configuration of twinkling lights, though SOURCE naturally assumed that the lights were associated with a flying object.

The lights observed by SOURCE and his wife, who saw essentially the same phenomenon as her husband, blinked on successively in the sequence, red to blue to white, at intervals of approximately 5 seconds. The colored lights were never seen to appear simultaneously. At times the lights appeared to shoot out the sides of the undiscernible object.

SOURCE mentioned that there were some aircraft in the sky throughout the period of the sighting and at times sounds could be heard in general direction of the blinding lights, but in his opinion, they were coming from aircraft considerably beyond the UFOB.

The Baltimore Filter Center received a call from SOURCE at 09/0252 informing them of the phenomenon. SOURCE then returned to his observation point outside his house and continued observing the UFOB, reporting again to the Filter Center as it altered its course slightly and a third time at 09/03/55 Sept 55 to state that the object had gone out of sight.

According to SOURCE, no photographs were taken of the UFOB.

II. RELIABILITY: Unknown. SOURCE was contacted by telephone.

III. SOURCE's DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At 09/0230Z Sept 55, just after having been post on the watch lookout station in Glen Burnie, SOURCE noticed a blinking, flashing phenomenon in the western sky. SOURCE stated that the lights apparently were coming from an object at least 5 miles from his station and flying at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet.

The condition of the sky was clear and the wind was slight. SOURCE's first thought was that it might have been a balloon, but the way it seemed to follow a consistent path and maintain a constant altitude, shortly precluded this possibility.

At 09/0252 SOURCE reported the baffling phenomenon to the Baltimore Filter Center, after which he returned to his watch and continued tracking the object. It followed a wavering course and appeared to be losing altitude, which SOURCE attributed to the object's track along the curvature of the earth.

SOURCE told the investigator that the lights changed color periodically from red to blue to white every few seconds, giving the appearance of a streak of light coming from the object.

Aircraft were in the sky at various times throughout the sighting, but SOURCE felt that none of these sounds could be associated with the UFOB directly. Its speed seemed to rule out possibility of its being an aircraft. Occasionally the sound would seem to come from the general direction of the UFOB (roar of aircraft). However, these aircraft seemed to be much farther beyond the UFOB.

SOURCE called in to report that the UFOB had begun to disappear at 09/0310Z Sept 55. No photographs had been taken of the UFOB.

The SOURCE stated that in his opinion, the object was probably a weather balloon. Investigator concluded the interview at this point.

Flight 3-14, 46024 AISS

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING:

1. The CAA Tower at Harbor Held, Maryland (GeoRef GJPK 2318) was called
for information on the UFOB. According to the controller on duty, Mr. H. H. Brandes,
none of the aircraft flying in the vicinity of Baltimore during the hours of the
UFOB sighting had noticed anything unusual in the surrounding sky. In his opinion
and any of the pilots observed an unidentified airborne object it would have been
reported to the control tower. A later check with this installation to determine
whether any blimps or dirigibles had been flying in the area produced a negative
response.

2. A check with the Air Traffic Control tower at Friendship Field (GeoRef
GJPK 2212) yielded substantially the same results, namely that they had received
no confirmation of an unusual flying object in the vicinity of Baltimore.

3. The Baltimore Filter Center was found to have been responsible for
submission of data on the UFOB to the 617th AC & W Sq in Manassas, Virginia, which
prepared the preliminary report. All observers of the object had called the
Filter Center to report their sighting.

4. Operations, 617th AC & W Sq was contacted and this installation reported
that in addition to the Presto Horn aircraft mentioned in their Preliminary Report,
see (encl. #1) an F-80 had taken off from Andrews AFB, Maryland (GeoRef GJPJ 0018)
at 09/0240, flown in the general vicinity of Baltimore at an altitude of 10,000 ft.
practicing GCI-GCA recoveries west and north of the city, and landed again at A
ndrews AFB at 09/03372 Sept 55.

5. A check with 617th FIS, Operations at Andrews AFB revealed the following
information concerning the activity on the night of 9 September 1955. First,
that How 1, 2, and 3 (F-86's) had taken off from Andrews AFB at 09/03252 Sept 55,
practiced intercepts and 110's before landing again at 09/00352. Secondly, that
Item 1, 2, and 3 (same type aircraft) had taken off at 09/00352, flown to the north
and west of Baltimore while practicing 110's and running intercepts before landing
again at Andrews at 09/00262 Sept 55. The aircraft were flying from 10,000 to 25,000
ft. during the maneuvers. None of the pilots from any of these aircraft had reported
having seen anything which resembled a UFOB. Each of the above mentioned fighters
have lighting systems which blink on and off at approximately 5 second intervals in
the sequence red to green to white.

6. The US Weather Bureau at Friendship Field was contacted and the officer
on duty stated that no longer launched meteorological balloons but that
Silver Hill weather station (GeoRef GJPJ 0463) near Washington did most of the
weather sounding in this area.

7. The Weather station at Ft. Meade, Maryland, (GeoRef GJPK 1607) was
called but no balloons had been launched from this site on either the 8th or 9th
of September 1955.

8. Contact with Air Research and Development in Baltimore and Friendship
Field revealed that this activity in this area is primarily administrative, not
experimental.

9. The 1760th GOS in Baltimore, which controls the operation of the Filter
Center and its civilian GCG volunteer support was responsible initially for the
sighting and the reporting of the UFOB. Its personnel on duty offered the utmost
assistance to the AISS Investigator conducting the Follow-Up Investigation.
