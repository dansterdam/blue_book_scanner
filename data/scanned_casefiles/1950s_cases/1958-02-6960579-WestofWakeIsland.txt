Observer: The observer felt this was not the usual aerial object or phenomenon, and observed it seemed to move in a circular motion like a tire or something rotating. It radiated a greenish charge. The observer did not see any size, bright, instantaneous flash, or other observations. 
Time and Date: 6 FEBRUARY 1958, 0944 - 0946

Observer's Aircraft position was 3110Â° I 1330". Observer were navigating at an altitude of 10,000 feet, descending to 7,000-8,000 feet. The object was observed at the 11 o'clock position, through the right hand forward cockpit window. It appeared to be at the same altitude or slightly below the aircraft. The object remained visible for 2-3 minutes, then disappeared. Communications with the radio and radar operator were made, but they did not observe the object.

Identification:
Aircraft No.: USAF 50-1178, Call Sign 41018.
Air Refueling: Air refueling by fighter, estimated to be complete at 1550Z.
Remarks: 1. Crew, navigator (call sign 41018).
2. Co-pilot: Lt. R. J. Garretty, 0-1727857, 41st Air Refueling Sq, pilot, refueling (call sign 41018).
3. Pilot: Capt. J. H. Parks, 0-763373, 41st Air Refueling Sq, pilot, refueling.
4. Navigator: Capt. G. L. Ballinger, 0-878898, 41st Air Refueling Sq, navigator.
5. Tanker: SAC, KC-97, S/N 52-0726, 43rd Air Refueling Sq, refueling (call sign 43).

Wind: 360, 20 kts. Cloud cover a 3/10 scattered well below 18,000 ft. altitude.
1. Winds aloft (recorded at wake island 1312-1322Z): 5,000 ft. - 320/20, 10,000 ft. - 330/35, 20,000 ft. - 330/45.
2. Clouds: 2/10 at 2,500', visibility unrestricted.
3. Ceiling: 3,000 scattered.
4. Visibility: plus 15 knots.
5. Cloud cover: 2/10 at 2,000'.
6. Thunderstorms: None.

Unusual activities:
1. The aircraft spent a considerable length of time in a stationary position with respect to the tanker during the refueling operation.
2. The refueling time was unusually long, which could be attributed to the unusual practice of an observation aircraft accompanying the operation. The aircraft on this occasion matched the description and capabilities of a USAF F-101 Voodoo interceptor. This aircraft accompanied the air refueling operation throughout but maintained a safe distance and did not interfere with the refueling operation.

UNCLASSIFIED SECURITY INFORMATION

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112  

SUBJECT: B-57 PAPA* 

DIVISION: Directorate of Operations, Office of Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations 

ABSTRACT: A sighting of an object near Wake Island on 10 February 1958 occurred at 2300Z. The object was observed visually and on radar and was described as revolving at high speed and emitting a bright, blinking light. The object was tracked for over 30 minutes and was estimated to be at an altitude of 40,000-50,000 feet and traveling at an estimated speed of 600-800 knots. After the preliminary analysis, other sightings which occurred before and after this incident are described in detail. The report includes a technical analysis of the radar and visual sightings, as well as a discussion of the possibility of this being a known object or phenomenon. The report concludes that the sighting remains unexplained and that the object observed does not fit the characteristics of any known aircraft or phenomena.

SUBJECT: Co-lplot - Andrew Dunner, 1st Lt, 421st Air Refueling Squadron, reports sighting while on a flight over the Pacific near Midway Island, almost all in multi-planes transport-type aircraft, appeared to be like giant lights, almost stationary, except for gradual acceleration, and apparent size changes.
Navigator - Smith, Douglas, 1st Lt, 421st Air Refueling Squadron, reports that while on the same flight, he took place during the time period involved. He states he apparently was right-seat co-pilot and observed the sighting same as Lt. Dunner. His version, however, is in the following terms:
"I filled into the observer's area to see if I could observe at high or low altitudes. What I saw were several objects well off to the west, about 15,000 to 20,000 ft I would estimate, and this was his first over-water station in a C-97 aircraft. Between navaid checks and celestial observation, he had the opportunity to observe these objects for perhaps 10 to 15 minutes. The appearance of a radar-like oscillation occurred suddenly during a conversation with the co-pilot and was pointed out to me. The objects appeared to be solid, not translucent, and possibly metallic in character. The westbound craft lag is not reliable, and possibly a rationalization based on the observer-navigator's statement."
Set Isaac's had 4 hours, 30 minutes 3/3/58, 21st Air Refueling Squadron, returns from Midway. Multi-engine transport-type aircraft. Over 15,000 ft, no definite trail or exhaust as from jet, speed appears to be accurate, reported sighting of 3 to 5 objects in close proximity, traveling at high speed and making rapid changes in direction. 
Operations Squadron Commander - within P.O. 6/3/57, 6/23, thoroughly commented on previous statements and testimony and there was no more to add at this time. It is only necessary to emphasize that the aircraft commander, Lt Dunner, copilot Smith, and navigator Dunner were the observer witnesses. The incident was considered significant enough to direct immediate reporting through channels.
General: No further information or evaluation.
