Brooklyn 21, N.Y.
Oct. 7, 1957.

Mr. President,

This morning at about 11:30 A.M. I gave the following information to Miss ____ of Col. Draper's office to be transmitted to you. She said she would pass it on.

On either Sept. 24 or 25th of this year when I emerged from the 50th St Station of the Eight Ave., Subway at about 5 A.M. as I reached the curb to cross westward I looked north up the avenue and saw an unusually large ball of light of a bright yellow cross the sky from west to a northeast direction. It seemed as large as my fist. It moved across the avenue about two thirds and then dipped. I took it for a shooting star and told Mrs. ____ about it when I got home. Since the news of satellite appeared in the papers, I recalled this experience and suspect that what I had really seen at that time was the satellite. Perhaps your physicists can check this observation. I thought that this information might in some way be helpful.

Thanking you for your attention, I am

Most respectfully yours
