Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:

I have a flying saucer story to tell you. Last monday i was about 9:20 p.m.
i spotted a large silver object above mt. rainier. it was as bright as a full moon and appeared to be hovering. then it took off at a terrific speed, disappeared in the east. 
when i first sighted it, it appeared to be the size of a silver dollar. at about the same angle a it moved away, it appeared to be about 15 or 18 feet in diameter. it was about 80 to 100 feet above me.
it was no plane or helicopter. first it hovered, then took off at a speed i never saw before. it made no sound at all.
i watched it for about 40 or 45 seconds. then i went to the house, told my wife. she confirms the story.
an east of that: when it went out of sight, i called the authorities in seattle, told them my story. they said they had no reports of any unidentified objects in that area that night. 
when i first saw the object, it seemed to reflect a pulsating light, almost as though it was charging up for a take-off.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

4 February 1959

Dear [Redacted],

Thank you for reporting your sighting of unidentified flying objects sighted over the past eleven and a half years. To assist the Air Force with the continuing of your sighting, please complete the enclosed questionnaire and forward it directly to:

Commander 
Air Technical Intelligence Center 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

It is understandable that sometimes during the press of exceptional circumstances some detail is omitted or proportions, but when given subsequent consideration, under laws you mentioned a mile or more does detail completely cut to the size of a half dollar if this is true, then at four miles the object is some 10 or 60 yards estimated to be, if you were in 60 seconds and this point would be closed to 60 miles in the minute, than the 7 miles estimated in your letter. It will be very helpful during analysis of this information if you would elaborate on this information when you complete the questionnaire.  

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major USAF 
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
Office of Information Services

The text in the document is as follows:

"Bright white came to be side. I Quickly it traveled around. 7 miles in 60 seconds. 

The object was drifting north at this time. The object went east. I have hand many reports of people seeing the type. This one to sell. But with a few seconds after it is sighted. It disappears into fog. More. This happens in my opinion come to the conclusion: That can't pick it up on a magnetometer. A few records of our baras mind. A small mind to pilot: The MITs words to fit. 

That at least 10 other times this wire yet piece in the sky. It would be impossible to smoot to one. And with a hearing evil."
