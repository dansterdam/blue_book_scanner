THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
HOWARD L. DAVIS, President
COLUMBUS 10
EMERSON MCMILLIN OBSERVATORY

19 May 53

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB.

Dear Lt. Olsson;

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss Gluck officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each folder. The letter method has obvious drawbacks. But until that time comes and she can handle my typing and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only 4 really interesting cases. I might mention a 5th, 28 March 53, Scott AFB, which is the last report I've seen of an honest to goodness mining. 6 Cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those.

8 April was a meteor.
The Great Falls[3 April] case was Venus if reported times was in error.

28 March Albrook AFB was probably Venus.
31 March Honahu, and 30 March Lyle, Wash., are puzzling but could possibly have been balloons.

The 8-April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.
This brings us to the interesting cases:
25 March Can Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no radar pickup. Was there any aircraft like helicopters that might explain this. Anything more come in on this one? Don't think this is good enough for a pinch-bottle but it should be listed as Nocturnal Meandering Right.

29 March Spooner, Wis.: Duration times needs checking here. I had to believe that object could have done all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one of the regular questions/yes should be sent to Mr. Gillette.

Next is the 12 April Stead AFB. I think this is the most interesting case of the batch, and I hope you receive more dope on it. Questionnaires should be sent. I'd like to see Menzel explain this one! Is there any possibility that these could have been airborne? Apparently ducks have been eliminated. Squasour AFB although NL, the data are too contradictory and insufficient. Perhaps this was a helicopter? We ought to have much more information on this one. Has this been received?

Sincerely,
[Signature]

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance to final one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part (1).)

Mr. [redacted] of Spooner, Wisconsin reported a circular aluminum disc approximately one half (1/2) the size of the moon and at a very high altitude. This object was observed for approximately fifteen (15) seconds during which time it was traveling at a very high rate of speed from south to north, returned to the south then traveled in a curved direction of travel and was last observed heading north. Object was sighted at 2145Z 29 Mar 53 approximately six and one half (6 1/2) miles east of Spooner, Wisconsin. The object was observed visually by four (4) persons who at the time of sighting were standing on an area near previous aircraft recognition. However, he had observed similar object previously at Spooner in 1938. Weather was clear cirrus clouds through which the sky was visible. Winds aloft 18,000 feet, 240 degrees at fifty (50) knots, 30,000 feet, 320 degrees at eighty (80) knots, and at 40,000 feet, 320 degrees at seventy (70) knots.
