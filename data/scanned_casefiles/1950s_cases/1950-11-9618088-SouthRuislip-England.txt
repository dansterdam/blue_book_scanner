Reference is made to SAC wire DIC 12660 dated 10 December to your headquarters on unidentified flying objects. Information in reference message is confusing. It is impossible to ascertain whether the sighting in question is the same as that reported in message 3 AD-DIC 3959 dated 10 November from CO Third Air Division, South Ruislip England, or whether it is a different sighting.

SAC message states that sighting occurred one week previous to 8 September. Date of sighting reported by Third Air Division. Third Air Division. Their message of 10 November stated that a full report was being prepared. To date this report has not been received.

AF FORM 112—PART II                                UNCLASSIFIED
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (AGENCY)                                       REPORT NO.
Deputy Chief of Staff, Intelli-                     IN-1-50

Four radar contacts were made with an unidentified object airborne over
England at altitudes of 1,000 or less to 30,000 and more, and giving returns
comparable with those of a B-29 aircraft, between 0859 and 1026½, 10 November 1950,
The object travelled at rates of speed varying from approximately 30 to 1,000
statute miles per hour. Its movement was characterized by its apparent capability
to make an exceptionally large number of abrupt changes of course in a relatively
short distance.

1. Visual contact was not made with objects. Returns on radar screen
permit estimate that object could have been of the order of size of the B-29 or
C-54. Object gave the same returns on the PPI scope and J scope that would have
been given by any single aircraft. The speed of the object varied from 30 up to
and well in excess of 1,000 m.p.h. statute. In one case the object climbed from
13,000 to 30,000 feet in less than five seconds giving a climbing speed in excess
of 1,000 m.p.h. while covering a lateral distance of 3,000 feet in the same period.
For the most part the object travelled at a speed of about 60 m.p.h. In maneuver
the object made turns very undulating both vertically and laterally at great speed
within very short lateral and vertical distances. In one case the object turned
90° to right from course for 600 yards of travel and then turned 150° to left for
200 yards, then 1500 right for 300 yards (speeds varying from 60 to 120 m.p.h.)
and then 1100 abruptly left. This maneuver continued for about 70 seconds. In
another case the object made 18 abrupt turns of 100° or more in a lateral distance
of 2,500 yards. At one time the altitude of the object was so low (around 1,000
feet) that it was lost in the ground clutter. In each case when the object
disappeared its speed was so great or its altitude so low as to be outside the
limit of capabilities of the automatic tracking circuits or the M/Q 2 radar plotting
equipment.

2. First contact was made with the object at 0859½ and lasted until
0907½ when it was lost in ground clutter. In this interval the ground distance
covered was about 8.5 miles. After a 50 second break a second contact was made at
0909½ which lasted until 0912½. The lateral distance covered in this interval was
about 1.8 miles. A third contact was made at 0946 lasting until 0947½ when object
was lost due to acceleration and lack of capability of radar automatic tracking
equipment. A last brief encounter was made at 1025½ lasting for a minute.
The object was then lost due to acceleration and accent precise exceeding radar
capability. No further contact was made.

3. Object was observed through surface radar contact by AN/MPS-2 (SCR-584
radar set and MC-627 type plotting board) Radar Bomb Scoring Equipment.

4. Observation was made from Heston Airdrome (510291N - 000232W), 2 miles NE of London Airport, Position of first and second contacts 5 miles NW of Bovingdon Airfield (510431N - 000321W) on heading of 450 T. Dropped at a point 2 miles SE of Luton (510571N - 000301W) after travel of 8.5 miles.

(This includes break between first and second contacts.) In these contacts object was observed at 20,000 feet, descending to about 1,000 feet and rising to an unexpected high altitude. The position of the third contact was at a point 6 miles south of Luton on course of 360° T, turning clockwise after about 3 miles to a heading of 600 T. Object was dropped at 13,000 feet to 20,000 feet. The fourth contact was made in the vicinity of Eastbourne (500501N - 000212E) on a heading of 220° T, turning to 270° T and then to 360°T. The object was dropped at an unknown point in the vicinity of Eastbourne after travel of about

7. None known.

8. None, other than RBS plotting traces showing ground track, altitude, and ground speed of object.

9. No aircraft were scrambled by the U.S.AAF, and R&AF, to attempt interception due to weather wind, in the case of the R.A.F. because of the absence of a frequency channel common to Heaton RBS.

SUMMARY: (Under concise summary of report. Give significant in brief cut notes, e. paragraphs. List inclosures if any trip, begin first of report on AF Form 12 - Part 11)

STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED

At approximately 0905 the undersigned observed the track of the first contact. The altitude and lon ground speed was considered very unusual. Uninterrupted the radar operator and plotters to keep the plane under radar surveillance and immediately checked the equipment. Malfunction was not indicated. Other aircraft flying in the area were picked up and tracked without difficulty. The first contact ended when the aircraft descended to an altitude so low as to make tracking impossible. A second contact was established which lasted about three minutes. The track was composed of very sharp turns which would be very unusual for conventional aircraft. The third contact occurred at 0945 and continued for a minute and a half. Break in contact occurred when storm "b's speed and rate of climb increased so rapidly so as to cause operator to be unable to keep the tracking gate on target. A fourth contact - of short duration south of the radar site was established at 1025. Loss of contact was caused by same reason as in the third contact.

STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED

At approximately 0915, I was called to the plotting van to observe the tracking end plotting of an aircraft flying in an unusual manner at the time of my arrival. Radar contact with the aircraft was lost. I examined the two tracks on the plotting board and questioned the plotting personnel regarding aircraft's manner of flight.

Realizing that it was an unusual occurrence, I introduced then to probe the area again in effort to re-establish contact. At 0946 contact was again made and a legible plotting track obtained for approximately 1½ minutes at which time contact with the aircraft was lost due to its high rate of acceleration and speed. Contact was again re-established to the south at 1025 and a legible track lasting 40 seconds was obtained. The aircraft was again making undulating turns and sudden altitude changes. Contact was again lost due to its high rate of acceleration and climb.

A further search lasting approximately 1 hour failed to re-establish contact. Observation of the tracking and plotting equipment revealed it to be in first class operating condition. Other aircraft were tracked in the local area with excellent results. All data obtained is included in basic report and photostat copies of plotting traces.

I, Sgt [name redacted] being called into the plott-r by Corporal [name redacted] to observe irregular track on the 16th at approx. 0605, after the following information: Shortly after 0env [illegible word], Lieutenant [name redacted] and myself arrived, Sergeant [name redacted] switched on automatic aging, which he said he had the same aircraft in the same scope again. This time is track was more irregular, and he seemed to be concerned. While clothing, and climbing, we watched, spent until 11 with a burst of speed he disappeared again. Sergeant [name redacted] again he picked up an aircraft in a different sector to test the equipment. This aircraft appeared on the board in a normal way, and Sergeant [name redacted] dropped it and went back to look for the first one again. He again picked up the first aircraft and we continued to track it until it made a sudden burst of speed in a climbing motion and the radar was unable to hold it in contact.

1. The information contained in IR-1-50, United Kingdom, entitled "Unconventional Airborne Object" has been carefully analyzed. It is the considered opinion of the Intelligence Department, AMC, that the described unidentified radar targets which were detected on 10 November 1950 by the SCR-584 radar, located at Easton Airdrome, were due to abnormal weather conditions.

2. Unidentified radar targets comparable to those reported in IR-1-50 were detected by an SCR-584 located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on 8 March 1950. Interceptor aircraft could not locate airborne targets but reported a local-local cloud in target vicinity. It was concluded that the ice-laden clouds were responsible for these unidentified targets. A similar explanation is considered applicable for the unidentified targets detected by the SCR-584 located at the Easton Airdrome. Rapid changes of target altitude, direction, and speed could be attributed to a rapid changing condition of the local atmosphere.

I, C.M. was on duty at 0800 hours Friday the 10th of November 1950, with Sergeant _____, we were checking the balance of the radar set by continuing the area in P.I. scan when we picked up a return. I looked it in automatic and tried to lock on. In through it was not resolved. It was a blip of low speed. We checked the altitude and found it to be around 19,000 feet. We decided to stay on it and get a track on the plotting paper to clock it's air speed as we had no wire to 70 on the range at that time. We tracked it on the plotting board and saw figured the ground speed from it. I tracked it in automatic and the change of speed was noticeable while tracking it. It seemed to almost come to a dead stop and then speed up again. Twice I lost it due to its irregular pattern. While trying to pick up again, I looked on numerous other aircraft and the set checked out OK. After I lost it the last time we kept searching the area but couldn't pick it up again.

I, Cpl                while standing by the radios on the morning of the
10th of November, at about 0855, I received a call on the interphone from Sergeant
                    to check the altimeter and ground speed of an aircraft he was
tracking. I switched on the plotting board and checked the altimeter. The aircraft
was flying at 19,500 feet, and seemed to be almost standing still. A check of the
track revealed his to be making between 50 and 60 "PH ground speed, and a further
check of the altimeter indicated that he was descending very slowly, until he got
down to ground level. The truck seemed very irregular, and not understanding it,
I called Lieutenant                 the Metropolitan Officer, and Sergeant                 the chief
letter on my shift. A short time later, after Captain                 and Lieutenant
                    and Sergeant                 slid arrived, Sergeant                 switched on Automatic
again, and until that he had the same aircraft in the scope again. This time his
track was more irregular, and he seemed to be accelerating, and climbing at unusual
speeds, until with a burst of speed he disappeared again. Sergeant                 again
indicated that he had looked up an aircraft. In a different sector to the test the
equipment. This aircraft appeared on the board in a normal way, and Sergeant
dropped it and went back to look for the first one again. He again picked up the
first aircraft and we continued to track it, until it made a sudden burst of speed
in a climbing motion and the radar was unable to hold it in contact.

SUBJECT: Reported Information on Unusual Radar Sightings

THRU: Director of Intelligence
ATTN: Technical Capabilities Branch
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D. C.

TO: Commanding General
Third Air Division
South Ruislip, England

1. Reference is made to confidential message, 3AD-DI C3998/11-10-50, subject: "Report in accordance with Par 24, Letter Hq USAF, subject: Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft dated 8 September 1950".

2. The radar sightings reported in the referenced message are believed to be spurious radar echoes caused by atmospheric conditions. The shape or signal characteristics of spurious radar echoes are of considerable assistance in analyzing the sightings. The signal returning from a target would occupy, in range, a space on the scope equal to the radar pulse length in seconds multiplied by the speed of electrical impulses through air. Thus, a pulse of one microsecond length multiplied by 186,000 (the speed of electromagnetic waves through air) would "paint" a target on the scope which would occupy 0.186 miles range. Spurious signals due to weather conditions always occupy more range than first from a single target and have a more rapid beating and/or change of signal strength than obtained from aircraft targets. Atmospheric conditions causing spurious micro-wave radar echoes usually consist of rain, heavy water-laden clouds and ice-laden clouds. Abnormal temperature changes with altitude are usually associated with these atmospheric conditions and may be responsible to some extent for the spurious echoes. The SCR-504, like all radar equipment operating at a frequency of about 3,000 megacycles per second, is susceptible to such spurious

AND 1st 3rd 11/24/50, to CG, Third Army Div, So. Ruislip, Eng, Subj:
(Conf) Report Information on Unusual Radar Sightings

1. The unusual speed and rate of climb reported can be accounted
for by the fact that the spurious echoes will disappear at one place and
appear at another with relatively minor local changes in the atmospheric
conditions of those places. Thus, the apparent movement of the scope image
from one place to another at unusual speed indicates the disappearance
and appearance of echoes due to local changing atmospheric conditions
rather than the actual movement of a radar target.

3. The echoes described in the referenced message are considered to
be very similar to those obtained on the scope of an SCR-584 at Wright-
Patterson Air Force Base on 8 March 1950. Fighter aircraft were vectored
towards the spurious echoes at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, but no
targets were seen by the fighter pilots. However, the pilots reported
the formation of ice-laden clouds at 10,000 feet altitude. The ice con-
ditions of these clouds were considered to be responsible for the
spurious echoes and the changing ice conditions of the clouds to have
caused the signal strength to fluctuate and to appear to be moving at
various speeds.

4. Another similar report was received concerning the area at Oak
Ridge, Tennessee. In this report, the type of radar set used and the
current meteorological conditions were unspecified. Fighter aircraft
were thoroughly vectored over the area toward the various echoes and the
plotting personnel reported several perfect interceptions. However, the
pilots reported nothing sighted on both daytime and nighttime intercep-
tions.

5. The Air Materiel Command will be interested in receiving the
report which was stated to be in preparation. The most interesting part
of the report would be photographs of the scope pattern obtained. If
photographs were not made of scope pattern for the sightings reported in
the referenced message, a special effort should be made to obtain such
photographs in the event of any future sightings.
