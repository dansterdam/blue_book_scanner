Object was observed, but details are as shown in attached statements.

From radar observations by USAF personnel, the object is described as follows:

Tracks were contacts were made with an unidentified object airborne existing apart from approximately 10 to 70,000 feet and from 1020 to 1025, 10 November 1950. The object travelled at a estimated speed of approximately 1,000 m.p.h. and executed violent gyrations and maneuvers which appeared to defy the laws of physics. The small size and extreme speed, together with the exceptionally large number or abrupt changes of course in a relatively short distance, were additional characteristics.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 
UNCLASSIFIED

Deputy Chief of Staff, Intelligence 
GHQ 3rd Air Division 
APO 525 Air Force

3 November 1950

Four radar contacts were made with an unidentified object airborne over England on 10 November 1950 between 1000 and 1300 hours, and at one time this object came to within 30,000 feet of a B-29 aircraft, between 0859 and 1025, 10 November 1950. The object traveled at an average speed of approx 1800 statute miles per hour. Its movements were characterized by its apparent similarity to those associated with jet propelled aircraft, such as suddenness of appearance, changes of course and high rate of speed.

1. Visual contact was not made with object. Returns on radar screen permit limits to be placed on size of the B-29 or G-54 object gave the same returns on the PPI scope and is inferred that objects would have been approx wingtip to wingtip size of B-29. Maximum altitude established by radar is less than 50,000 feet and minimum altitude is less than 13,000 to 20,000 feet is less than five seconds giving a climbing speed in excess of 8,000 feet in the same period.

2. First contact was made with the object at 0835'? and lasted until 0907 when it was lost in ground clutter. In this interval the ground distance covered was about 2.8 miles. A second contact was made at 0946'? lasting until 0957?? when object was lost. The approximate distance covered was about 1.3 miles. A third contact was made at 0944'? lasting until 0957?? when object was lost due to acceleration and descent speeds exceeding radar capabilities.

3. Object was observed through surface radar contact by AN/TPQ-2 (GPA-584 radar set) and disappearing point was 08,45'? in this contact.

4. Observation was made from radar van at Hilston Airbase (520951'N - 0002315'W) of motion and position as described. Positions of first and second contacts 5 miles NW of Bovingdon Airfield (510337'N - 0002312'W) on heading of 439 degrees. Dropped object (this term of length of paper track) approximately 7 miles of London (near 515345'N - 0000108'E) after travel of distance of 3.1 miles and according to an observer descending at high altitude. The position of the third contact was at a point 6 miles south of London on course of 360 degrees, turning clockwise after about 6 miles to a east southeastern heading of 120 degrees at an altitude estimated at 13,000 to 20,000 feet.
The fourth contact was made in the vicinity of Eastbourne (500501'N - 0000215'E) making of 2251'? at time when the object is reported to have turned and accelerated towards the sea, this direction of travel of about 225 degrees.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 19-1-50
DATE 1-9-50
The report describes observations made by the 3rd Air Division of the U.S. Air Force. The observations were made by the 302nd RIG Squadron with experience in the radar field. The report details the weather conditions, ground speed, and altitude of the observed object, as well as the fact that no aircraft were scrambled to attempt interception due to weather conditions and the absence of a frequency change beacon.

UNCLASSIFIED

AT approximately 0905 the under contract observer contacted the track of the first contact. The altitude and low ground speed was considered very unusual. This disrupted the radar operator and plotter to the point that they were unable to maintain an accurate plot of the first contact. The first contact ended when the aircraft descended to an altitude so low as to make tracking impossible. A second contact occurred which lasted about six minutes. During this time there was no indication of evasive action being taken by the aircraft. The third contact occurred at 0946 and continued for a halt. Brake in contact occurred when the aircraft gained a much higher altitude. The climb increased so rapidly as to cause the operator to lose the contact. A fourth contact occurred in contact secant which indicated the aircraft's speed and rate of climb increased. A radar site was established at 1025z. Loss of contact was caused by same reason as in the third contact.

STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED

At approximately 0915, I was called to observe the tracking and plotting of an aircraft flying in an unusual manner. At the time of my arrival, radar contact was maintained with this strange object. I questioned the plotting board and questioned the plotting personnel regarding aircraft's manner of flight.
This plotting showed that it was an unusual occurrence at 0946. Contact was again made and again lost. Contact was then re-established to the south at 1025 and a legible track lasting 40 seconds indicating changes. Contact was again lost due to its high rate of maneuverability and climb.
A further search lasting approximately 1 hour failed to re-establish contact. Operation of the tracking and plotting equipment revealed it to be in first class operating condition. Other aircraft were tracked in the local area with excellent results during this period. All data obtained is included in basic report and photostatic copies of pp-plotting traces.

Text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

WE WERE ON DUTY AT 0900 HOURS, FRIDAY, 10 NOVEMBER 1950. WHEN OUR ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE WEST, WE SAW A SILVERY OBJECT, WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING AT ABOUT 25,000 FEET. IT WAS NORMALLY CIRCULAR, BUT BECAME ELONGATED AS WE WATCHED IT. THE EQUIPMENT WAS WARMED UP AND CHECKED OUT AT ABOUT 0915 HOURS. THE RECORDING INSTRUMENTS WERE ACTIVATED AND THE OBJECT, WHICH SEEMED TO BE RECEIVING THE RADAR SIGNALS, WAS TRACKED. IT INCREASED IN SPEED AND THEN HOVERED AGAIN. IT CONTINUED ITS ERRATIC MOTIONS FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES. 

C. THE POWER WAS CUT (THE RADAR OPERATOR ON DUTY) AND HIS RELIEF TOOK OVER. AT FIRST CONTACT IT WAS ABOUT 35,000 YARDS DISTANT. DURING THE NEXT HALF HOUR IT CAME MUCH CLOSER, SEEMING TO BE ABOUT 10,000 FEET AS NEAR AS WE COULD JUDGE. IT WAS ABOUT 25,000 FEET WHEN IT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED, LEAVING NO TRACE. WE ESTIMATE ITS MAXIMUM SPEED TO HAVE BEEN IN THE REGION OF 1,500 MPH. ITS ALTITUDE VARIED FROM 15,500 FEET DOWN TO ABOUT 10,000 FEET BUT IT CONTINUED TO MANEUVER ERRATICALLY. THERE WAS NO CLOUD COVER AND VISIBILITY WAS GOOD AT THE TIME. THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 40-50 FEET IN DIAMETER. DURING THIS TIME THE PERSONNEL OBSERVED IT CONSTANTLY AND THEY DESCRIBED IT AS BRIGHTLY REFLECTING THE SUNLIGHT IN A WAY THAT SUGGESTED IT WAS MADE OF METAL. IT ACCELERATED SUDDENLY FROM REST AND THEN STOPPED AGAIN JUST AS SUDDENLY. THIS MOTION WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AND ON EACH OCCASION IT TRAVELED FASTER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. AFTER CHANGING THE RADAR OPERATOR, THE SET WAS OPERATING PROPERLY AGAIN, SO WE COULD CONTINUE TRACKING THE OBJECT. AFTER A MINUTE AND A HALF THE AIRCRAFT WAS LOST. WE WERE UNABLE TO PICK IT UP AGAIN IT WAS LOST AFTER A VERY SHORT TIME AS WE WERE UNABLE TO CHANGE THE RANGE OR ELEVATION TO KEEP IT IN VIEW. NO FURTHER CONTACTS WERE MADE DURING THE BALANCE OF THE DAY.

1. The information contained in IR-1-50, United Kingdom, entitled "Unconventional Airborne Objects" has been carefully analyzed. It is the conclusion that the conditions described are those of similar reports received by AMC in recent months and that the incidents described ESSOR-58* radar, located at Hesston Airdrome, were due to abnormal weather conditions.

2. Unidentified radar targets comparable to those reported in IR-1-50 were detected by an SCR-584 located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on 3 March 1950. Meteorological conditions at that time were such that the targets were concluded to be normal radar reflections. A case-to-case analysis of these unidentified targets shows that the individual echoes had all the characteristics of normal radar returns. The rapid changes of radar altitude, direction, and speed could be attributed to a changing condition of the local atmosphere.

STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED

1250, 18 Nov 49. At approx. 7:45 p.m. on the 10th of September the writer was on duty at USCO hours 7 Friday. The Object Checking Operator phoned the Officer of the Day to report a visual sighting of what appeared to be a falling star or meteor. It is automatic that any "object" or "sighting" be recorded so the writer went to the control tower to check it. We thought it must have been a minor aircraft or similar. We looked at the object for some time and decided it was a very slow falling object streaking east to west. We decided to stay on it and got a track on the plotting board and followed it as far as it could be tracked. It was erratic and figured the ground speed from it. It appeared to automatic and the others will corroborate to the effect that it was a unknown object, very slow, not an aircraft or meteor and we couldn't identify it.

THRU: Director of Intelligence

TO: Commanding General
Third Air Division
South Ruislip, England
1. Reference is made to confidential message, 3AD-DI C3998/11-10-50, subject: "Report in accordance with Par 2d, letter Hq USAF, subject: Report of Unidentified Aerial Objects dated 6 September 1950".
2. The radar sightings reported in the referenced message are believed to be atmospheric conditions. The shape or signal characteristics or spurious radar echoes are of an indeterminable nature in analyzing the sightings. The signal returning from the objects indicated a pulse length in seconds multiplied by the speed of electrical impulses through space, a pulse of some 100 microseconds (the speed of miles per second of electromagnetic waves through space) would occupy 0.186 miles range. Spurious signals due to weather conditions always occupy more range than signal information and remain a more rapid beating and/or scintillation characteristics than the atmospheric conditions causing spurious micro-wave radar echoes. Abnormal temperature changes with altitude are usually associated with these atmospheric conditions and may be responsible to some extent for the spurious echoes. The SCR-584, like all radar equipment operating on a frequency of about 3,000 megacycles per second, is susceptible to such spurious echoes.

The image does not contain any photographs, only text from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

AMC 197 did 11/24/50, to CO, Third Air Div, S/O Russell, Eng, Sub: (Cont) Reports on Unusual Sightings.

The unusual speed and rate of climb reported can be accounted for by the fact that the sightings occurred was the witness at one place and appears at another with relatively minor local changes in the atmospheric conditions. Thus, the erratic movements of the scope image from one place to another and the unusual speed indicates the disappearance and appearance of echoes due to local changes in atmospheric conditions rather than the movement of a radar target.

The echoes described are considered to be very similar to those obtained on the scope of an AN/SCR-584 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1950. Fighter aircraft were vectored towards the spurious echoes at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, but no contact was made by the fighter pilots. However, the echoes reported on 11/24/50 were considered to be responsible for the various echoes and the changing conditions of the clouds to have caused the signal strength to fluctuate and to appear to be moving at various speeds.

Another similar report was received concerning the area at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In this report, the type of radar set used and the current meteorological conditions were unspecified. Fighter aircraft were vectored over the various echoes and the plotting personnel reported several perfect interceptions. However, the pilots reported nothing on both sightings and nighttime interceptions.

The Air Materiel Command will be interested in receiving the report which was stated to be in preparation. The most interesting part of the report would be photographs of the scope patterns obtained. If photographs were not made of the scope patterns for the sightings reported in the event of any future sightings, photographs in the time event of any future sightings.
