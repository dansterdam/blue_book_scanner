CENTRAL OHIO

A STRANGE OBJECT
Lighted Craft Sighted
By Astronomy Class
By PAUL GAPP

A strange object bearing eight to 10 lights was observed soaring through the Central Ohio skies at Perkins Observatory Monday night.

Several astronomy students Several astronomy students were members of a class led by Prof. Allan Hynek, assistant dean of the Ohio State University Graduate School and a member of the Department of Physics and Astronomy.

Students at the observatory near Delaware gave this version of the sighting:

At 9:15 p.m., the craft was sighted in a south, southwest-erly position. It moved rapidly at an "irregular speed" of several degrees a minute.

Observers did not calculate the distance of the craft, which was then closely watched for several minutes.

A five-inch telescope was trained on the object, which was then slowly watched for several minutes.

It flew back and forth, alternating in a southeast to southwest course.

Some of the observers said the craft's movements were erratic. All agreed it traveled at high speed.

A trained astronomer told The Dispatch "it couldn't have been a balloon. It looked like some sort of aircraft with a lot of lights."

Most of the lights were yellow. All were steady.

OSU astronomers are interested in learning more about the sighting. They have asked the public to contact them if any additional details are known.

Anyone having information on the sighting is requested to write, not telephone, the McMillin Observatory on the OSU campus.

Hydrographic Bulletin

METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers are studying meteors. Mariners reporting their observations of these hours are greatly assisting in this work. It is desired to have the Greenwich time and point of appearance and disappearance as accurately as possible, either by bearing and altitude, or by relation to fixed stars, or both.

Complete observations on long-enduring trains and their direction of drift are of especial importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.

NORTH ATLANTIC

Capt. [REDACTED] reports that at 2340 G. M. T. on October 11, 1952, while on a voyage from Puerto la Cruz to Philadelphia in lat. 22°46' N., lon. 69° W., he observed a luminous object which appeared in the western sky traveling eastward with tremendous speed. It lightened the whole sky with a bluish-green light which gradually diminished until the object disappeared in the east after about 7 seconds.

Wind E, by S, very good visibility, air temperature 82° F.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency)                REPORT NO.
172nd ACW Squadron            R-86-52
Fort Belvoir, Virginia

1. On the night of October 14, 1952, at 0155 p.m., I was sitting on a sidewalk tubing to two others and I was looking NE toward North. The object was very large or big in size, when suddenly and with extreme speed an object appeared (moving from east to west) at least 20 miles north, traveling at an overall velocity of 15 to 20 miles per second. It was in clear view for 5 to 8 or 9 or 10 seconds in trails of 20 sec.

2. I can state without hesitancy, that it was a guided missile, rocket, or something which I am certain was not a plane. I am positive of this.

3. The sidewalk, on which I was sitting was located between two buildings east/or 3 times which were 3 to 10 feet apart (one on west side).

4. The wind across the street, north of where I was sitting, was 20 to 50 feet away in a house (two story) approximately 70 feet high and 50 feet long.

5. The object appeared at an angle while so high as the house (or 60 to 65 feet high), 20 miles away.

6. The wind was not blowing out positively was not a worry; it was not a shooting star nor any type of plane. I am confident it was a rocket, but was absolutely horizontal, nothing (climbing) very swift) manner that is noted across the sky.

7. Although, it was at least horizontal, it presented the same effect as a rocket would. Immediately after the object was seen, with the flame and speed behind the rocket, the light of the rocket persisted a glance of the vapor immediately behind the rocket, only for an instant, not over one second.

8. Because of the position that the other two men were sitting, they did not see the object.

9. The address of the house where the object was sighted by me is [REDACTED] Avenue. I will cooperate in any way and will be glad to show you the location, etc. No help you can get a clear picture of the facts.
