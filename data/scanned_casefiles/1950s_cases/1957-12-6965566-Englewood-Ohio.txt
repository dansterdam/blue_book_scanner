Colonel Mitchell

Dear Colonel Mitchell:

On 30 November this office received a call from
Mr. _______, Los Angeles
22, California, reporting he had sighted several unidentified flying objects on the previous day over his
neighborhood and further that he had photographed the
objects with his personal 8MM motion picture camera.
He was most anxious to cooperate with the Air Force
and stated he would turn his exposed roll of film over
to this office for processing as soon as he finished
exposing the roll that was left.

To expedite a time for pickup, assigned 1/c
Fred Stull from this office to drive to Mr. ______'s
residence and brought the 8MM roll of Eastman Kodachrome
film to the office for processing. Since there are no
local Air Force facilities for handling 8MM color, we
decided to have the film processed through regular commercial facilities available through Storer's Drug Store
at Sunset and Geary. I read the film in 16 mm and
after approximately two weeks for normal processing
I picked up the film. The film had no extra processing and was in good condition. No reason for Mr. ______
to withhold or fake the filming of the objects.

For your information, enclosed are drawings made
by his three children who observed the same objects. He has called my home several times and discussed

Here is the text from the document:

the film with me and he was quite surprised and happy
when I told him he did have several good shots of the
unknown objects. To my personally existing nature of
the original film from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
which will then be returned to Mr. Bann.

Mr. [redacted] is to be commended for his handling of
this situation and for his sincere wish to be of service
to the Air Force and his country by reporting and
filing unquestionably objects. We in this office are
grateful for his efforts. The quality of the film is
to expose and color balance seemed to be of excellent
quality and the photography was well done on a most
difficult subject.

If we can be of any further assistance in this
matter, please call on us.

Captain Schaller
Pictorial Branch, USAF
6085 Sunset Blvd.
Hollywood, California

Dear Captain Schaller:

Here is the report you requested in our last telephone conversation. I believe it to be accurate and complete....

On Sunday, Dec. 1, 1957 at approximately 3 P.M. my wife and I were in our home in Montebello, when our eight year old boy and I, one of the twin girls (age 13) living across the street came in the house screaming "flying saucers, flying saucers"! I ran outside but the objects were nowhere in sight. I assumed by their actions that they had seen something unusual, so I ran back in the house, grabbed my 8mm movie camera, in the hope that whatever they saw would return. At this point, the other twin hearing the commotion, joined us on the sidewalk. We were intently searching the eastern portion of the sky where the objects were last seen, and suddenly I saw six U.F.O.'s in obvious formation, moving rather slowly in a westerly direction just slightly north of our position, maintaining a constant speed and direction until they disappeared in the west. Fortunately, it was a beautiful day, the sky a lovely blue. While I was taking the films, some branches of a tree (no leaves this time of year) appeared in the viewer. This incident was later termed "very fortunate" by Capt. Schaller, Chief, Pictorial Branch, USAF.

The objects appeared oval shaped, and the color a soft white. I suppose it could be described as a soft white light. It did not appear to me to be the type of 1 light reflected from shiny metal. This is the best verbal description I can give.

As soon as the objects disappeared, I phoned the E.L.A. Sheriff's Dept. They advised me to phone several other numbers which proved to be a waste of time....no answer on Sunday.

At this point the kids came running in the house again, very excited, yelling "they're back"! I ran outside, but was too late. The kids said that the formation had changed pattern again, and this time they went over "very fast". Altogether, the kids saw three passes: west to east, east to west, and back again to disappear in a general southeasterly direction.

After the excitement had died down, I separated the kids and had each of them draw a diagram of the formations, numbering the passes 1, 2, 3, and I saw only the second pass.


- page 4 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

and am forced to rely on the children's discription of the first
and third formation patterns. I'm sure the following is correct:

1. A rather tight three-quarter circle.
2. Grouped in two's and arranged in a
   slightly elongated triangle.
3. A straight wing formation.

Having no success at my first attempt on the phone, I decided
to phone the operator. Taking the risk of her thinking me a lunatic,
I explained the whole story, and asked to be put in touch with some-
one in the Air Force. She came up with the number of a Capt. Shapiro.
He referred me to Captain Schaller. He was very courteous and seemed
interested. Hoping to eliminate any possible charge of fraud, I told
him that I would rather let the Air Force develop the film. A couple
days later an enlisted man stopped by the house, picking up the
sketches and the undeveloped film.

About three weeks later I again talked to Captain Schaller, and
he seemed well pleased and even a little excited, and he said the
films were of "excellent quality", and the best UFO's he had seen.
He added that a rather well-known officer by the name of Colonel
Dean Hess was excited about the films, and that he would call me.

Colonel Hess called the next morning and complimented me on the
manner in which I had handled the situation, and said in his opinion
the films were the best UFO's that he had seen. Including the films
used in the movie U.F.O. Col. Hess told me the original film was my
property and would be returned to me. He added, "I have taken the
liberty of sending the films back to Wright-Patterson AFB where they
have the facilities to analyse and make copies of the film." He also
stated that the Air Chiefs of Staff were doubly interested in view-
ing the film, especially when they discovered that the person that
had taken the pictures had not yet seen the results. (I still haven't
as of this date). In a subsequent conversation with Col. Hess, he
said I would also receive a 16mm copy.

I have told my story to various friends. When some of them
doubted my story, I phoned Capt. Schaller, asking for a letter of
acknowledgement to prove my story. Three days later I received in
the mail a copy of the report Capt. Schaller had sent to Col Mitchell, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Box 378, Pasadena, Calif.

One shocking note was pointed out to me by a civilized investigator who alleges an Air Force "policy of secrecy". He referred me
to the official orders entitled JANAP 145. Also AFF 200-2 and official
instructions to personnel of the CAA based of JANAP 145. This latter
order applies to civilian airline pilots who report UFO's officially,
on a communications system known as CIRVIS---Communications Instructions
for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings! Why all the secrecy if
UFO's are explainable phenomena?


- page 5 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

It is my understanding that it is AF policy to vigorously invest-
igate all "good" UFO reports. Almost two months have past and the
only person xm that has bothered to investigate me was a flying
saucer enthusiast.

It is also my understanding that is AF policy to send a
detailed questionnaire to all people making a "good" report. "Where's
mine?" If they wait much longer, the report will probably be class-
ified as of "doubtful value" or similar double-talk.

In conclusion, I would like to point out that many civilian
and military pilots, radar men, control tower personnel, scientists,
astronomers, and ordinary citizens like myself have made these reports.
The official AF policy to date has been to ridicule these observations,
explaining them away as weather balloons, meteors, mirages, mock suns,
planets, reflections, weird cloud formations, etc. This stock answer
is both imprudent and inaccurate. It is certainly insufficient to
explain the agility of the UFO's we saw and photographed. Who ever
heard of weather balloons flying in formation? The objects we saw
traversed the sky THREE TIMES, from horizon to horizon, maintaining
a different formation pattern with each pass. This sighting is
dramatic evidence, supporting the argument held by many competent
observers that there is intelligent control.

Hoping this report to be of value....

Sincerely,
[Signature area blacked out]

REPORT OF INTERVIEW WITH MR. [REDACTED]

On 31 January 1958 Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED] called at my home to pick up the 8mm film which they had loaned this office. We had finished duplication of the film at a local color film lab and the original 8mm film was returned to Mr. Benn.

I examined his camera, an 8mm Keystone Capri K28 1½" F3.5 telephoto lens Tiffen Photar 85 Series 21.5mm.

The film used was Kodachrome Indoor Type a shot outdoors with a type-a filter. The distance setting was on infinity and shot at 16 frames per second.

I asked Mr. [REDACTED] the following questions:

Q. What is your estimate of the altitude of the objects which you photographed?

A. About the same height as the light airplanes which I frequently/fly over the house, between 3000 and 4000 feet.

Q. Were they at any time as high as jet aircraft which make vapor trails?

A. NO, definitely not.

Q. Did you see any smoke trail or any kind of trail from the objects?

A. No there was no visible trail of any sort.


- page 7 -

Q. What was the direction of flight?
A. The first pass sighted by the children came from the West and went in an easterly direction.

Q. Were they in any sort of formation?
A. Yes, a very close or tight formation in a 3/4 circular formation.

Q. At what speed, compared to a light plane passing over?
A. About the same speed, maybe a little slower.

Q. What direction was the second pass?
A. They came from the East heading West in an enlarged formation, split into pairs, with the point of the V formation to the right side of the formation.

Q. What was the speed of this pass?
A. About the same as the first pass, slightly slower than a light airplane.

Q. What about the third pass?
A. This pass was not photographed, but the boy said they went over in a straight-line formation, opposite the viewers position at a very fast speed, at about the same altitude.

Q. What were the size of the objects?
A. That's hard to say.

- page 8 -

Q. Would you say they were as big in circum-
ference as a circle inclosing the wing tips and tail
to nose section of a light airplane?
A. Yes, about that size.
Q. Were they all the same size?
A. Yes.
Q. What shape?
A. They were circular, and relatively flat.
Q. What color?
A. Sort of white-blue-green glowing objects.
Q. What do you think they were?
A. I don't know, but they were certainly not
balloons or airplanes like any I had seen before.

(This concluded the main portion of the interview.
Mr. [redacted] is in the process of moving to a new business
in northern California. Any future contact can be
addressed to him at [redacted], Redding, California.)

April 29, 1958, St. Paul, Minnesota:
A UFO similar to the one reported in the case on April 21 was sighted by several tower operators at Wold-Chamberlain Airport and by other observers. The CA man said the UFO did not resemble a meteor or any other known object but that it moved west to east at high speed on an open path without climbing or descending. It was described as emitting sparks from its glowing nose before its abrupt disappearance. The UFO also was seen by NICAP number M. T. Sherman, insurance underwriter and businessman, who reported it to an Air Force Captain Nueman of Wold-Chamberlain. The captain quickly ruled out Venus, which Sherman suggested.

"Too slow," stated Mr. Sherman. "A careful path had the object's speed much faster than Captain Nueman suggested. Finally Captain Nueman suggested a new anti-collision light on a plane, but Sherman pointed out how:

• When the light went out on plane was visible in the sky which at 9 p.m. was still fairly light.
• He would have heard any aircraft.
• No pilot in his right mind would approach a field with such heavy traffic at such high speed and suddenly at low altitude turn out all lights.

The Air Force captain had no other suggestion and the sighting was officially recorded.

[The rest of the text continues with various sections about NICAP, UFO investigations, and related topics, but I've provided the first substantive paragraph as an example of the OCR output.]

1. Reference is made to letter addressed to your office from the National
Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, Washington, D. C., dated 1 July 1958,
copy to this Center for comment. This is our reply.

2. In rebuttal to the above subject the following points are outlined:

   a. Colonel Hess, Chief of the OIS, Hollywood, California, made an exact
   copy of the Benn Film when it was submitted for his review.

   b. The film submitted to ATIC, through SAFIS, was Kodak 8MM film of
   standard 25 feet length.

   c. The copy made by Col. Hess during all interviews with Benn and now in
   our custody is exactly 25 feet in length.

   d. Examination reveals no cuts, splices or alterations.

   e. The images of alleged UFOs are on a part of the film approximately 4½
   feet in length and are all here on file; technically, the first 55 frames, or 9 inches,
   indicate nothing. The next 4½ feet contain the alleged UFOs. The balance of approximately 20 feet contains various sundry scenes, persons, etc.

AFHO FORM    0-86    PREVIOUS EDITIONS OF THIS FORM MAY BE USED.    GPO 908344

- page 13 -

3. Therefore, legally:

a. If we have exact copy of the film as given to Colonel Hess, reproduced there in his California photo lab, and "our" copy shows no splices, cuts, etc. - himself or others must have made the cuts -- after it was received back from the Air Force.

b. Mr. [redacted] should be asked to show the alleged "clipped strips" to the Air Force.

c. A copy of our copy could be made for [redacted]'s retention to show that the "UFO strip" is still intact to do whatever he wishes, advertise it, sell it, show to the public, or,

d. Have Colonel Hess invite him down and ask him to lay out his film alongside the Air Force copy -- and compare them, with Colonel Hess requesting a statement in writing that the "UFO strip" is still intact.

4. The 8MM reel was examined under magnification by Major Buckmaster, Chief, Photographic Branch, ATIC and Captain Gregory on 23 December 1957, the date of receipt. There was no UFO report other than film other than that it was taken near Montebello, California on 1 December 1957. All concurred that the objects, which were rather faint and at some distance, were balloons, and probably a balloon cluster.

5. Attached are thermofax copies of a balloon cluster being launched by a western university having an Air Force contract. Mr. [redacted] should compare these with the alleged UFOs on the film strip.

6. In the opinion of this Center this is another of the many charges made by those who apparently do not know (and actually only a few know, or are told) that the Air Force (now) makes a duplicate of all photos and movies.

COMMENTS: ALLEGED UFO
Montebello, Calif
1 December 1957

1. Looks like two pairs of balloons.

2. Move in unison - keep same distance.

3. Film too short and slightly out-of-focus and over-exposed.

4. Because of three (3) above, with very limited data (no exact azimuths, bearings, directions, elevations, etc.) very difficult to make a sound.

5. Review of letter, with the "chips on his shoulder" attitude, plus the obvious attempt to make a "big project" out of 5 seconds of film - strongly suggest that he knew what the objects were. Can't prove it though.

6. Enlarged to motion-picture screen size: Reviewed by Lt. Col Whitcher, Sgt. Bolieu, and Capt Gregory in UFO Project Room.

The balloons were not identified Weather bureau said; they weren't clear. Weather balloons are filled with helium or hydrogen, a spokesman said, which has an odor.

As for the boom, the Strategic Air Command headquarters at Omaha said it had no unit to take charge of plastic objects and try to identify them.

Other missile centers in Southern California and New Mexico - as well as the Defense Department in Washington - said there was no missile tracking yesterday.

The balloons are clear plastic, about 18 inches in diameter. They were bound, loose, and said with firecracker string.

DATE: 23 Dec 1957

SUBJECT: (U) Request for Review and Comment--UFO Motion Picture Film

1. Reference conversation between Maj. Buckmaster and Capt. Gregory, Saturday night, 21 December 1957, regarding a UFO film that Gen. Watson was informed would be submitted to this Center for immediate review and comment.

2. Request study of subject film, with detailed comments as to the nature of the objects purported to be UFOs. The detailed report attendant to this case has not arrived as yet, but a brief TT message regarding the general circumstances surrounding the matter is attached.

3. The fact that the film was submitted directly to the PIO Office in Hollywood, rather than directly to ATIC or AMC is considered significant. Reference our recent discussions concerning the soon-to-be-released report to AFOIN that approximately 85% of UFO hoaxes submitted are from Southern California.

4. Hq. USAF has telephonically requested that it be notified immediately of our findings with regard to this film.
