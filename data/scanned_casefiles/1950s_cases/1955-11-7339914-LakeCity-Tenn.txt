III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE observed the objects from a hill (GIFO 5012) at 202300Z Nov 55. Objects were sighted at 245° azimuth and at an elevation of 45°. SOURCE was certain he observed the objects for 15 minutes. The sky condition was bright twilight and a few stars were observed. An SOURCE looked at the objects the sun was in front of him. Objects were brighter than the background of the sky. The objects compared in brightness of an automobile headlight a mile or more away, and their edges were smoothly outlined. The objects appeared to be constructed of metal and were elliptically shaped and solid. They were dull orange in color and stood out in contrast to the sunset. SOURCE was certain the objects compared in size to a football-held at arm's length. SOURCE was looking toward the southwest when first sighting the objects and toward the west when they disappeared from view. When disappearing they were at 260° azimuth and 20° elevation. They faded from sight due to distance. SOURCE had never witnessed a similar sighting previously.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. There were four other sightings of this object at OAK RIDGE (OJTC H132), TENN. Questionnaires were distributed to the four individuals to be filled out. They stated that the questionnaires had to be cleared by AEC security personnel before they could be forwarded. It was understood that this would involve a minimum delay. OAK RIDGE was called subsequently on two occasions to request that the questionnaires be forwarded to this unit, but after a prolonged delay it was felt this report should be submitted minus the additional questionnaires.

2. These comments are based upon a summary of the observations of the seven sources available. Six of the sources were military personnel with high school or college educations, and the seventh source was a civilian, telephone company manager. Four of the sources observed the objects from a hill top, one source observed them from his back yard, one source observed them from within his automobile, and it was not determined where the other source was located when he observed them. Lost of the sources indicated the objects appeared to move in a manner similar to, but not identical with, a light intensity equal to that of an auto headlight. From several blocks to a mile away. Source indicated the objects did not pulsate, flicker, throb or smoke. The objects were estimated to have been in view for a minimum of thirty seconds, a maximum of twenty minutes and an average of ten minutes. They were estimated to have been from eight and twenty-five miles away. Their size was estimated to have been from that of a pea held at arm's length to that of a football held at the same distance; exact sizes were estimated as having been equal to a C-47, 100' long, 100' X 200' and 150' X 250', respectively. Their speed was described as having been erratic and from 0 to 900 MPH. No noise was heard coming from the objects.

3. The long duration of observation (average of ten minutes) and the shape seem to rule out the possibility of these objects having been meteors. Neither could they have been aircraft since their flight characteristics (erratic course and speed) were not comparable to those usually associated with aircraft. Also, aircraft would have been picked up by radar, but these objects were not, it is unlikely that the objects were stars or planets due to their size, shape and duration of observation. There is a possibility that the objects were balloons caught in a jet stream. That might account for their erratic course and speed, but it would not explain their remaining motionless at times. Balloons would not give a radar return unless they carried sonde equipment. All sources indicated the sun was going down and a bright twilight continued. Existing conditions. This might account for the changing reflection observed. However, the shape of the objects would leave some question as to the possibility of their having been balloons. They were described as being elliptical or cigar shaped.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer (Contd):

4. These deductions seem to eliminate all of the possibilities existing dept. optical or weather phenomena. They would have no restrictions as to size, shape, length of observation, course, speed, color or distance. They would not necessarily have shown returns on radar. They are probably more common at the particular time since the sun was low on the horizon and some stars could already be observed. It was indicated in the initial report that interceptors were sent aloft but reported negative results. This seems to substantiate the premise that the objects were some type of phenomena rather than material. The preparing officer believes that this latter solution is more feasible than the former solutions.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Further investigative efforts revealed the presence of two temperature inversions (surface to 2,000' and 11,000' to 13,000') in the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting.

It is the opinion of this headquarters that the sighting was probably caused by the viewing of the planet Venus through the above mentioned temperature inversions.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was completely thorough in his description of the sighting. SOURCE was extremely cooperative and of superior intelligence.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE and his son were in their yard (QJFG M132) when the objects were sighted at 260° azimuth and at an elevation of 30° - 30° from the horizon. SOURCE observed the objects at 2022202 Nov 55, and was clearly certain that he observed them for 10 minutes.

The sky condition was bright twilight. The sighting was of two oblong objects, semi-transparent and light orange. They were similar to a cloud like, the sun at twilight. They were not con-trails although they did look like small clouds travelling at a terrific rate of speed, moving towards and away from each other on the same heading.

The objects were estimated to be 8 to 10 miles apart and approximately 20 miles away, flying west but not into the sun. SOURCE estimated their size to be between 100 and 200 feet. As SOURCE looked at the objects, the sun was 200° to the left. The objects compared in brightness to an automobile headlight a mile or more away. The brightness and shape of the objects were consistent. Their course was erratic, and they seemed to suddenly appear and disappear due to strange off smoke, break up, flicker, throb or pulsate. SOURCE was fairly certain objects' compared in size to a half dollar held at arms length. Objects were last sighted at 280° azimuth and did disappear due to distance but rather due to sinking below the horizon. SOURCE believed it could have been a balloon in a jet stream, SOURCE estimated the distance of the objects to be from 15 to 20 miles and speed to be 800 plus MPH.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE observed two objects from atop a hill (GRID 6:12) at 200° azimuth and at an elevation of 22° from the horizon. SOURCE observed the objects at 202238, Nov 55 and was "fairly certain that he observed" them for 4 minutes. The sky condition was bright twilight. SOURCE estimated construction of objects to be of a light metal such as aluminum, magnetism or titanium; approximately 25 feet long and 150 feet wide; and possibly only shaped, "The objects appeared to be solid, silver and yellow in color with edges like a bright star." Objects appeared to stand still in relation to background, suddenly speeding up and rushing away. "They did not change position." SOURCE, Flicker, throb or pulsate. During the duration of the sighting they did not move behind or in front of any cloud formations, and they were brighter than the background of the sky. "The objects compared in brightness to an automobile headlight" several blocks away. The objects were 5 miles apart laterally with a difference of 200 feet in altitude. Velocities were noted by SOURCE at the time of observation. SOURCE was certain that they compared to a 25 or a 100 mile an arm's length, as SOURCE looked at them to his right, and when they disappeared they were at 250° azimuth and an elevation, and they merely faded from vision. SOURCE estimated the distance of the objects to be 25 miles and their speed to be 900 MPH. SOURCE had never previously witnessed such a sighting.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was vague in his description of the sighting. SOURCE was cooperative and of average intelligence.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE observed the objects while driving his automobile at the rate of 40 MPH 2 miles (GNG 1695) east of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on highway #61 at 2022%52 Nov 55. The objects appeared to be aircraft of a cigar shape and about the size of a C-47 without wings. They appeared to be of metal construction, and were fairly high and at a slow rate of speed. The objects were brighter than the background of the sky and compared to brightness to that of an automobile headlight a block away. The objects were viewed through an auto windshield and had a bright orange glow. Their edges were like those of a bright star. SOURCE was fairly certain the objects compared to a pencil held at arm's length. The objects seemed to be heading in a northwesterly direction or making a turn toward the northwest. SOURCE had never witnessed a sighting similar to this previously. The objects crossed the horizon and disappeared from view.
