10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One, dish-shaped object, like an emery wheel, silvery-white in color, appeared to the observer for a period of six seconds. Object traveled a circular flight path from F to N at an extremely fast rate of speed. The obj was estimated to be approximately 230 ft in diam.

11. COMMENTS
Four trails could possibly contrails and the speed of object could be attributed to reflection of sunlight. A check with COC Weather at ADC revealed there were no temperature inversions at time of sighting. Observer possibly saw reflection of sun off a high flying jet a/c and contrails of jet a/c.
