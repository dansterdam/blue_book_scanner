1. DATE: 5 Jul 55
3. RATING OF GROUP: UNRATING GROUP
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: VISUAL
6. PHOTOS: O Yes X No
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 6-8 SECONDS
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Rapidly maneuvered object, like an energy wheel, observed to the observer's right for a period of six seconds. Object traveled a circular flight path from E to N at an extremely fast rate of speed. The object was estimated to be approximately 230 ft in diameter.
13. CONCLUSIONS: X Was Balloon
Probably Balloon
Probably Aircraft
Probably Astronomical
Insufficient Data for Evaluation
11. COMMENTS: This could possibly contraindicate and tend to reflection or specular effect. A check with an astronomer and further study may be appropriate to determine a possible astronomical explanation for this sighting.

UFOB INDEX CARD
1. DATE: 5 JULY 1955
2. LOCATION: Georgetown, Massachusetts
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
4. TYPE OF SIGHTING: Civilian (000)
5. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One (1)
6. COURSE: Circular
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 31x (3) Seconds
8. CONCLUSIONS: Probably Astronomical
9. COMMENTS: See Attached-ATIC-215-on-this sight-ing. This sighting could possibly be of a high flying jet aircraft and the similarity of this object to the one at ADO revealed that there were no temperature inversions at the time of this sighting. It is the opinion of this investigator that this sighting is not of astronomical origin. The BM off this high flying jet aircraft and the contrail is the similarity of this observation.
