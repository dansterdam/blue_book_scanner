There are also several handwritten notes on the right side of the document, but they are partially illegible and would require careful transcription.


- page 3 -

The text on this page is largely illegible. The only clearly visible text is the word "JAPAN" handwritten at the top right corner of the document. The rest of the page appears to be a form or document with horizontal lines, but the text within those lines is too faint or blurry to be read with certainty.
