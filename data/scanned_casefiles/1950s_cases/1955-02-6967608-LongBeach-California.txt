Here is the text I can discern from the document:

Noticed
TED 1000 12 00 - PG 7

[Several lines of text are partially illegible]

ACTION

[Remaining text is mostly illegible or cut off]

In the top right corner, there are some handwritten notes:
2 lttrs
3 lttrs
4 pgs

The text in the image is largely illegible. There are some partially visible words and fragments, but most of the text is obscured by black redaction marks. The document appears to be a page from a report with multiple sections, but the specific details cannot be discerned due to the extensive redaction.
