TO:   Commanding Officer
       Mitchell Air Force Base
       New York

The Air Technical Intelligence Center wishes to commend two officers of your organization, Major Garys and Captain Darby, both of Base Operations, for the excellent and thorough manner in which they investigated the report of an unidentified flying object which originated with your organization on 1 December 1952. This investigation included the obtaining of narrative statements from each of the observers at Mitchill Airport, La Guardia Airport, Westover Airport, Newark Airport, and James Air Force Base. Having obtained these statements, the two officers of your organization employed outstanding charts in order to come up with a solution to the cause of the incidents. Their thoroughness in the investigation and their highly commendable, yet imaginative approach to a logical conclusion are

Mitchell Air Force Base, New York                                     1 December 1952

I.    Description of Incident

Between 0430 and 0500 EST a number of observers from varying locations around the New York City area noticed a single, round object with colors ranging between white, white-orange and amber. All observations placed the unknown in the NW perpendicular 15° above the horizon on a 300° azimuth heading with a slow drift to the south finally sinking out of sight. All observations were unaided visual sightings or with binoculars. Although radar was tried, there was no electronic return from the object.

Observers were experienced CAA rated Airways Operations Specialists and Control Tower Operators. Observations of the reported object were as follows:

    Location                Azimuth         Elevation        Times
a. Teterboro Tower         275°             0°               0447
b. Westchester Tower       280°             15°              0445
c. Newark Tower            315°             2°               0458
d. La Guardia Tower        290°             1°               0430
e. Idlewild Tower          270°             15°              0445
f. Mitchell AFB Tower      285°             6°               0411
                           305°             0°               0459

An Eastern Airlines Flight inbound to La Guardia was queried as to a strange light appearing in the west. The pilot sighted the object after several minutes of scanning and reported "a cluster of lights" close to the western horizon.

The weather at the time of observation was CAVU and extremely clear for the New York City vicinity with the winds NNW at 16 knots average.

II.   Discussion of Incident

Intelligence personnel at Mitchell AFB determined that the planet Jupiter, on 1 December, has an approximate azimuth of 300°, -2 magnitude (extremely bright), and disappears below the horizon approximately the same time the object was last observed. Undoubtedly, the unknown object is thus explained. The white to amber color range can be explained by the presence of light refracting through atmosphere dust. This report is on one of the most complete in ATIC files and the resourcefulness and common sense of the Mitchell Intelligence Officers is to be commended. Complete personal statements and azimuth elevation headings were obtained from 6 points of independent observation. If the object had not turned out to be Jupiter, triangulation from those data would have been possible.

Travel Report - Lt. A. G. Flues
Mitchell AFB - 12 Dec 52

Lt Flues contacted Maj Geyer in Base Operations at Mitchell AFB. Major Geyer referred Lt Flues to Capt Dyste also of Base Operations who handled the investigation of the Flyobrpt of 1 Dec 52. Capt Dyste had completed and forwarded through channels an AF Form 112, concerning this incident. Through the use of a statement of each observer and a navigator's star chart, Capt Dyste had positively identified the object as the Planet Jupiter. Weather conditions and descriptions were strikingly similar to those of the Presque Isle sighting of 10 Oct. The followup 112 which should reach ATIC shortly was so complete in its details and the conclusion was so obvious and logical that Lt Flues did not pursue the matter further.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Report of Unconventional Aircraft

Near Mitchell Air Force Base, New York    From (Agency) Headquarters, 2500th Air Base Wing Mitchell AFB

DATE OF REPORT 5 December 1952    DATE OF INFORMATION 1 December 1952    EVALUATION

PREPARED BY (Group) Captain John S. Dyate    SOURCE TWX - JKL 460-12 BQ 2 Dec 1952

SUMMARY:

The single object was sighted at several wide spread locations by ten observers. The object was placed near the horizon and in approximately fifteen minutes it disappeared below the horizon. A majority of the observers placed the object at 500° azimuth and drifting North and down. The colors described were white, amber, orange and red tint. The weather at the time of observation was unusually clear. From a sky diagram in the American Air Almanac it was found that at the same time and with the same azimuth as the last sighting of the object, Jupiter follows the ecliptic which intersects the horizon at the angle that the path of the object was observed to follow. It has the same white-orange or red tint as the observers described. A magnitude chart would fit the brightness described for the objects.

Significance: The azimuth, elevation, movement and description of the planet Jupiter at the time of the sighting, so closely parallel the majority of the observations, made possible by exceptionally clear weather, could have been responsible for the reported objects.

FROM: Headquarters 2500th Air Base Wing

REPORT NO.                PAGE 1 of 1     PAGES

1. Description: The single object was described as round, oval and elliptical by all but one observer who described it as rectangular. All observers stated that the object was in a close range of colors from white, white-orange, orange, amber and red tints. None of the observers could give any detailed description of the object to as to give any identification. Two observers, using binoculars, reported a bright white halo with a gray edge around the object. All observers saw a slow drift parallel to the horizon and turning downward to the horizon and are starting parallel to the horizon and turning toward the horizon. All observers place the object at an azimuth between WSW to WNW, with the majority of the observers being 280° to 300°. The one air observation is in disagreement as to description of the object sighted.

2. Time sighted: The sightings all occurred from 0430 to 0500 EST.

3. Manner of observation: All observations were unaided or with binoculars. Two attempts to observe the object by radar had negative results.

4. Location of observers during sightings:
   a. Teterboro Towers, 74° 03' N 40° 50' N
   b. Westchester Towers, 73° 42' N, 41° 00' N

   f. Mitchell AFB Tower, 73° 36' W, 40° 44' N

5. Information on observers: All the observers are CAA rated Airways Operations Specialists or*Control Tower Operators. All the observers can be estimated to be highly reliable and experienced.

6. Weather and wind conditions: The weather at the time of the observations was extremely clear for this area. Wind NNW 14 knots average.

7. The "Morning Sky Diagrams 1952 December" from the "American Air Almanac" 1952 September, show the planet Jupiter, with a -2 magnitude, with an azimuth of 300° and setting at the time of the last sighting.

STATEMENT

Dec. 2, 1952

At approximately 0443S on December 1, 1952, LaGuardia Tower requested that the undersigned controller on duty in the Teterboro Tower scan the horizon west of the field for some object sighted in the area just to the northwest of the LaGuardia Tower.

After scanning the horizon for a period of five minutes the object definitely was not sighted by the undersigned controller.

At one time, at approximately 0447S, a very faint amber glow was visible over the ridge just west of the airport out towards Caldwell-Wright airport, but could not be identified as any object flying in that area.
