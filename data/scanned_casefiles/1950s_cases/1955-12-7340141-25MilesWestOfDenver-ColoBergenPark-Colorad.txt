7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
Estimated two (2) minutes

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) round object, the size of a matchhead
held at arm length, estimated to AN be the
size of a large type bomber aircraft. It
was estimated that the object was at 40,000'.
Object was silver in color (described as
being like aircraft in color.) Observers'
attention attracted by jet passing overhead,
then they saw object. It moved slowly at
and then appeared to gain speed. Speed esti-
mated to be from that of jet a/c to 1,000 MPH.

(No case in file)

11. COMMENTS
The two SOURCES were telephonically interviewed by this hq. Both were of dubious reliability in the opinion of this hq. Negative results were obtained when this hq tried to contact pilot of jet a/c near just before object was seen. Both SOURCES admitted the possibility of the object being a high flying a/c when queried. Lack of control and gain in speed convinced the SOURCES (at time of sighting) that the object was not an aircraft.

Resolved as a POSSIBLE AIRCRAFT
