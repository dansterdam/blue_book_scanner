h. Description and course of object.

1 Co-pilot saw what he thought at first to be a falling meteorite, then realized the object was in view longer than the normal burn out time. He called this to the attention of the aircraft commander, the navigator and the weather observer (who also observed a previous earth satellite).

2 Angle of elevation was observed by the navigator to be 20° at an azimuth of 230° FROM North tracking to 120° when it first appeared.

3 Angle of elevation was 20° at an azimuth of 120° when it disappeared.

4 The object rose from our right quartering rear and made an arc across our flight path with a maximum elevation of 35°.

5 It disappeared to the left of our nose.

6 The aircraft commander checked his watch at 1725Z when he first sighted the object and 1729Z when it completely disappeared.

i. Manner of observation.

1 Air to air sight.

2 No optical aids.

3 Aircraft in which observers were flying was WB-50 AF-490288, 30,000', TH 160°, 270 kts, from Burtonwood RAF Station England.
