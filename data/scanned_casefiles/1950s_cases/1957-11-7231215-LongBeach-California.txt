I was working in the weather station when I heard Major Baker and Airman Abramson call me out to observe something unusual. They pointed to a small red to 5 NM. In said cloud I observed several small, red-colored objects gliding in and out of the cloud in no great formation.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det 4, 1606th ARS                 ATC3-VR00-34-57         PAGE 7 OF 8 PAGES

At approximately 1930 hours PST 5 Nov 1957 I
witnessed certain phenomena in the sky. I could not
readily identify. In my initial observation, the following
time cloud for direction of movement, free energy of light,
and precise description: the area was red in my field
of vision certain objects. These objects appeared to have
a regular shape, a metallic luster, and uniform appearance.

For the period of approximately 90 seconds these objects
darted in and out of the base of the clouds to the northeast
of my observation site at an estimated height of 700 feet
and at an approximate distance of ten miles. The angle
of elevation from true ground was about 10 degrees. The
movement of these objects appeared to be helter-skelter.
Less than normal in formation. In this
movement there was no time at which I may say that the objects
were set to collide, or merge, or even to cross the direct
path of each other.

To the sky we darkened by the cloud it is not
possible that these objects could not be seen with natural
light. The forms did not have the common or light
spots. The cloud was dense. For the observation I will say
there was such balance. But they were strange. I would
believe not due to "normality" of the objects in a cloud.
There was not natural movement of which I can say I
understand. I see one or two objects which I could have
been natural occurrence. I do not attempt to classify those
objects.

CONTENTS OF PRELIMINARY CENTER:

1. A meeting concerning the status of the air law
on the subject to be explored, the following possibilities are offered:

a. Official Determination: Since ATIC method of detection is
now being used at a scene and at Lackland AFB, 6th Weather
Reconnaissance Wing, Public Information Division, Bureau,
Washington, was contacted. They stated that to their knowledge
it was possible that this air incident could be
clarified. A 1st Lt. Fitzgerald, with a 2nd Lt. Son of the
15th Wing, was upon to be i.e. arc. His recollection
was that a ground to air visual contact was made, the presence of more than one object, erratic movement and the
speed of the objects.

b. After the three-way aircraft in the vicinity at the
time of the incident, checking the weather conditions, position, altitude, possible ice, and units, could certainly
account for the sighting.

2. An evaluation of "possible optical phenomenon" and / or
Aircraft is given to this sighting.

[Signature]

Major, USAF
Commander, Det 4

COMMENTS OF THE APPROVING OFFICER:

In view of SOURCE's statement that "the objects might
have been light reflections due to ice or what-is accompanying
the storm," an evaluation of "Other Possibly Optical Phenomena" is given this sighting by the Approving Officer.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEW

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information (Herbert S Taylor)

TO: Hq USAF SAR-OIPB (Mrs Geiser)
Wash 25 D C

6 NOV 1963

1. Reference the attached letter from Herbert S Taylor, dated
31 Oct 63, requesting information on unidentified flying objects.
Our record reveals previous correspondence from him.

2. The following information is provided to assist you in a
reply to Mr Taylor:

a. The 29 Jan 51 sighting at Sioux City, Iowa, carried an
initial evaluation of aircraft by the investigating committee in
1951. However, subsequent review indicates there may have been
possible astronomical aspects to this sighting involving the planet
Jupiter. (Magnitude -1.7) which was located at 10 degrees elevation
in the West. The star Deneb was in the Northwest as the reporting
aircraft pilot was taking off, and the star Regulus in the East.
The setting of the planet Jupiter corresponds with the final report.
The case still retains its original evaluation as aircraft.

b. The Long Beach sighting of 5 Nov 57 has been evaluated as
possible reflections on sheet-ice, from either the sun or from
lightning. Also, there was a balloon in the area and there were
10 aircraft in the vicinity of the airport at the time of the
sighting. There is no record of transient military personnel
observing the objects. However, the report indicates that the
crew of a B-25 also observed the objects. The objects were observed
on the edge of a storm cloud in the presence of thunderstorms and
lightning. The entire duration of the sighting was 90 seconds.
There was no information presented to indicate that these objects
were other than optical phenomena associated with reflection.

I went outside to the Mt. Station about 1650 hrs to
observe the thunderstorm to the northwest. It is thunderstorm
was estimated to be approximately 10 miles to the northwest.
While watching for lightning and trying to get a picture of the
direction of movement of the storm, several very f st moving
objects to a seen at the west edge of the storm. They were
very rapidly lack at North was like a moon-glow flight.
They then went down and lost sight over a pass or hill or
momentarily during their turns. They stayed in view over a
minute and finally lost sight of them in the storm. Visibility
was excellent during the entire period.
