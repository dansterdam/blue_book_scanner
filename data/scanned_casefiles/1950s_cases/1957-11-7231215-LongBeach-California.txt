WAS ON PATROL IN A 80TH AIRCRAFT WHEN I OBSERVED
TO OUR LEFT FLYING OBJECTS WHICH APPEARED TO BE
CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF

WERE EMITTING NO EXHAUST PLUME OR FLAME. THEY
TRAVELED IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION AT A CONSTANT

FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME I OBSERVED THEM THEY APPEARED
TO BE MAINTAINING A SPEED WHICH WAS ESTIMATED TO BE
IN EXCESS OF 700 KNOTS. THERE SEEMED TO BE NO
EVIDENCE OF WINGS OR OTHER AIRCRAFT APPENDAGES WHICH

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
MISSION 10-6-51 A155  
A155-UFOB-387-57
SUBJECT: SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
1. On 25 June 1957 at 10:50 PM Pacific Standard Time, two observers, the Deputy Sheriff of Los Angeles County, California, and a private citizen, reported observing a bright light in the sky which appeared to be descending.
2. The object was observed for approximately 20 minutes. It appeared to be round or circular in shape and emitted a bright white light. The light pulsated at irregular intervals. The object hovered over the Griffith Park area of Los Angeles, California, for several minutes. It then moved in a northerly direction at high speed, and disappeared.
3. The observers stated that the object appeared to vary in size during the observation, as if it were expanding and contracting. It appeared to be at an estimated altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet. The observers estimated the size of the object to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter.
4. It is the opinion of the undersigned that the object observed was not a known aerial vehicle, and that its characteristics and behavior are unexplainable by any presently known aeronautical or astronomical phenomena.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDSE

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information (Herbert S. Taylor)

TO: HQ USAF SAF-OIPT (Mrs Geiser)
WASH 25 D.C.

1. Reference the attached letter from Herbert S. Taylor, dated 31 Oct 63, requesting information on unidentified objects recently seen from him.

2. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply:

a. The 29 Jan 51 sighting at Sioux City, Iowa, carried an initial conclusion of mirage. However, subsequent review indicates there may have been possible comment to indicate this sighting involving the planet
Jupiter in the west. The star Deneb was in the Northwest as the reporting aircraft pilot took off and the engine in the East.

b. The Long Beach sighting of 7 Nov 57 has been evaluated as possibly caused by the bright Venus planet at the time, there were approximately 10 aircraft in the vicinity of the airport at the time of the sighting. There is no report of remarkable maneuvers associated with this observation.

c. The case still retains its original evaluation as adequate.

The image contains a photograph that appears to be a UFO sighting report from Project Blue Book. The photograph shows a sketch or drawing of a disc-shaped object, described as being "round" in shape with a "metallic" or "silver" appearance, and of a size estimated to be "five or six" feet in diameter. The text indicates that the object was observed on August 12, 1954, and that the witness was unable to make an accurate count of the object due to its movement.

II. SYNOPSIS:
At approximately 1920 hours on 5 November 1957, while on routine patrol in the control tower at the Long Beach Airport, the observer sighted an unidentified object in the sky. The object was observed for a period of approximately five (5) minutes, during which time it was tracked on the airport's radar scope. The object engaged in various maneuvers and is considered to be unidentified.
III. DETAILS:
1. On 5 November 1957, at approximately 1920 hours P.S.T., the observer was on routine patrol in the control tower at the Long Beach Airport. The observer then spotted an unidentified object in the sky, approximately 15 miles southwest of the airport.
2. The object was observed to be round in shape, with a diameter estimated to be 75 to 100 feet. It was a bright white in color, and appeared to be luminous. The object was observed to make several sharp turns and abrupt changes in direction, traveling at a high rate of speed. At one point, the object stopped suddenly, hovered for a few seconds, and then accelerated rapidly, disappearing from sight.
3. The observers reported that the object was tracked on the airport's radar scope during the entire period of observation. The radar returns indicated that the object made several rapid changes in speed and direction.
4. After the object disappeared from sight, the observer immediately reported the incident to the 75th Air Police Squadron and to the Federal Aviation Agency. Both agencies expressed interest in the sighting, and requested that a detailed report be submitted.
5. It is the opinion of the observer that the object sighted was not a conventional aircraft, and that its performance characteristics were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft.

I went outside the we ther station about 7:55 p.m. on 6 Nov 1957 to observe the sky. At 8:00 p.m. I observed an object at about 60 degrees northeast altitude which moved across the sky in a westerly direction. While watching for about 15 minutes, the object appeared to stop and then resume movement in a southerly direction at a velocity that appeared to be about 500 to 600 miles per hour. The object changed color from white to orange to red. It appeared to have a vapor trail. The object made no sound that could be heard. It was visible for about 15 minutes, then disappeared from view. Visibility was good. The object appeared to be metallic and glowed with a steady glow. I observed this object with Mr. J.D.
