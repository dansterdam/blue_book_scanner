AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Aerial Object Sighting on 27 July 1950 in Germany
Germany
30 August 1950

Captain, USAF

1. The Intelligence Officer, 1602d Air Transport Wing, Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany, reports that a member of the 1602d Air Transport Wing, sighted an unidentified aerial object in the sky to the west of Wiesbaden Air Base.

"At 1802, while sitting on the porch of the MATS barracks, I observed an object. In the western city at an approximate bearing of 315 degrees and approximately 45 degrees vertically, well above the sun which was low in the sky. The body resembled an automobile headlight tilted so that a portion of its under elliptical surface was visible with no motion other than a slight oscillation of its lateral axis. At approximately 1812, I called Pfc R. M. Grisillo, sitting near me, and requested that he observe the sunlight being reflected from the body and its lack of motion. Grisillo exclaimed, 'It's a flying saucer!' At 1854Â½ I observed an almost simultaneous acceleration and disappearance of the object."

2. The Intelligence Officer states that the description of the object was substantially the same as Sergeant Pretkola's. Neither of the airmen observed any means of propulsion and neither could state the direction taken prior to the object's disappearance.

3. The two control tower operators who were on duty at Wiesbaden Air Base at the time of the sighting were contacted. Neither had observed anything unusual during their period of duty. One of the operators, however, stated that from their position in the tower, in relation to the sun's rays, it would have been difficult for them to discern an object on the described bearing.

PLANE SAFE WHEN HIT BY "FLYING SAUSAGE"

SPRINGFIELD, Ill., July 29- Pilot Jim Graham, pilot for the "flying sausage" collided with his plane and "exploded like a bomb" but caused no damage.

Mr. Graham, chief pilot for the Capital Aviation Company, who was flying to Springfield from Chicago, said last night when he sighted the object as he flew over Williamsville, that north of here, "struck about ten feet long and shaped like a sausage." He said it was trailing yellow fire.

The object, which was slightly phosphorescent, suddenly and completely sloughed into his propeller.

"I exploded like a bomb when it struck," he said.

Mr. Graham managed to stay on course. He expected to find his plane damaged to stay on course. He expected to find his plane damaged relatively, but a thorough inspection showed nothing.

Several other Springfield residents reported seeing the "flying sausage" near where Graham and her husband were sitting on their porch and saw it pass over.

"We making a popping sound," the said.

Observers at the Weather Bureau said the only explanation they could offer was that the object was a meteor that did not explode right in front of them.
