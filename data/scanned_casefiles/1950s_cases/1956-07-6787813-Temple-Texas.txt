REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

Date of observation: Tuesday, July 31, 1956
Time: Around 8:20 A.M.
Location of object: West-south-west of Temple, Texas
Elevation of object above horizon: Approximately 30 degrees
Direction of flight: West-south-west; flight level and straight, speed uniform, during entire observation

Speed: Equal or greater than jet. (positively not the speed of a kite, or slow speed of a drifting balloon- wind was 8-5 MPH south-easterly)

Color: Brilliant, soft milky-white, very similar to glowing fluorescent lamp

Shape: Perfectly round, or globular; very sharp, distinct outline: No Tuesday, rings or other appendages

Length of time object was in sight: While observer drove 5 blocks west, on Adams Street, turned left at 23rd, Street then observed full out this area. Clear, cloudless sky, no loss than 20 MPH- or estimated time of observation: one and a half to two minutes

After viewing the object for approximately three quarters of time in full clarity and brilliance, it slowly dimmed, and finally faded completely out, but not diminishing in size or speed; there was no sparking, no smoke or sparks, or explosion, just slowly faded down to extinction. Object moved entirely too slow for a meteor or UFO to be of known design during this one and one-half to two minutes of observation

Apparent size: One-fifth the size of a full moon, or 3 or 4 times larger than Venus

No vapor trail or smoke visible

OTHER POSSIBLE SOURCES OF PERTINENT INFORMATION: After driving about 5 city blocks further toward my place of employment after the object disappeared, or roughly 2 minutes later, the regular flight of a passenger plane came from the direction of Houston, and landed downward for a landing at Temple Airport, which is about 5 miles away. This plane crossed the apparent location where the UFO was seen in flight.

Page 2 of 2 pages.

With this rough timing, this plane should have been only a very few miles south-east, with the UFO dead ahead, in clear blue sky, and could have been seen and possibly reported by this crew.

This object positively in no way, in appearance or performance, resembled a balloon, plane, meteor, bird, smoke, feathers, paper, cobwebs, or a flow or reflection in my windshield.

Two separate reports of Unidentified Flying Objects sighted over Durango, Texas, were sent to James Connally Air Force Base, at Waco, in July and November, 1952, and each was separately and personally investigated by Air Force Officers.

This latest sighting was telephoned promptly to the news department of the local Temple Telegram, with an offer to fill in an added details for an item of the odd event; the news report has been ignored.

I shall be glad to offer any additional information or clarification that I can give regarding this latest sighting.

Gentlemen:

I wish to add this bit of information to my report of an unidentified flying object observed by me on July 31, 1958 at Temple, Texas, which was forwarded from James Corally Air Force Base at Waco, Texas.

In addition to my initial report, I have also completed and returned your ATIC Form 164, both given in the clearest description possible in writing but today was forwarded to you as a local theater the film, "Unidentified Flying Objects."

The single object which I observed and reported looked exactly like other one of the pair shown in that part of the film which was photographed in 1950 by Nicholas Mariana, at Great Falls, Montana, except the object I saw now relatively slowly, and was in view considerably longer, but otherwise was the same apparent size, shape, color, and with the very same appearance during its dissolution.

A review of this particular part of the above film will present a visual duplicate of what I observed and is pinned to describe in my report and in Form 164.

I trust this will be helpful in evaluating this sighting.

Very truly yours,

[Signature redacted]
