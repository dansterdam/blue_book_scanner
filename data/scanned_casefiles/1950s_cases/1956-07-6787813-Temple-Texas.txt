REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

Date of observation: Tuesday, July 31, 1956.

Time: Around 8:20 A.M.
 
Location of object: West-south-west of Temple, Texas.

Elevation of object above horizon: Approximately 30 degrees.

Direction of flight: West-south-west; flight level and straight, 
speed uniform, during entire observation.

Speed: Equal to or greater than jet. (positively not the speed of a
meteor, or slow speed of a drifting balloon—wind was 3—5 MPH
south-easterly.)

Color: brilliant, soft milky-white, very similar to glowing
fluorescent lamp.

Shape: Perfectly round, or globular; very sharp, distinct out-
lines— no fuselage, wings or other appendages.

Length of time object was in sight: while observer drove 5
blocks west, on Adams Street, turned left at 23rd. Street when
object faded out in the RET—black-out cover going less than
20 MPH— or estimated time of observation: one and a half to
two minutes.

After viewing this object for approximately three fourths of time
in full clarity and brilliance, it slowly dimmed, and finally
faded completely out, but not diminishing in size or speed;
there was no breaking up, or shower of sparks, or explosion,
just slowly faded in to extinction. Object moved entirely too
slow for a meteor as only 40 to 50 degrees of azimuth was covered
during this one and one-half to two minutes of observation.

Apparent size: One-fifth the size of a full moon, or 3 or 4
times larger than Venus.

No vapor trail or fumes visible.

OTHER POSSIBLE SOURCES OF PERTINENT INFORMATION: After driving
about 6 city blocks further toward my place of employment after 
the object disappeared, or roughly 2 minutes later, the regular
flight of a passenger plane going from the direction of Houston,
and headed downward for a landing at Temple Airport, which is 
about 5 miles away. This plane crossed the apparent location
where the UFO was seen in flight.

With this rough timing, this plane should have been only a very
few miles south-east, with this UFO dead ahead, in clear blue
sky, and could have been seen and possibly reported by this crew.

This object positively in no way, in appearance or performance,
resembled a balloon, plane, meteor, bird, smoke, feathers, paper,
cobwebs, or a flaw or reflection in my windshield.

Two separate reports of Unidentified Flying Objects sighted
over Durango, Yukon, were sent to James Connally Air Force Base,
at Waco, in relaxed Morrowbert, 1952, and each was separately
and personally investigated by Air Force officers.

This latest sighting was telephoned promptly to the news depart-
ment of the local Temple Telegram, with an offer to fill in
any needed details for a news item of the odd event; the
news report has been ignored.

I shall be glad to offer any additional information or
clarification that I can give regarding this latest sighting.

Residence:                                          Temple, Texas.
Occupation: Bookkeeper.

Gentlemen:

I wish to add this bit of information to my report
of an unidentified flying object observed by me on
July 31, 1956 at Temple, Texas, which was forwarded
from James Connally Air Force Base at Waco, Texas.

In addition to my initial report, I have also completed
and returned your AFIC Form 164, both given in the
clearest description possible in writing; but today
I was fortunate to view at a local theater the film,
"Unidentified Flying Objects."

The single object which I observed and reported looked
exactly like either one of the pair shown in that part of
the film which was photographed in 1950 by Nicholas
Mariana at Great Falls, Montana, except the object I
saw moved directly away at an even flow considerably
longer, but otherwise was the same apparent size, shape,
color and with the very same appearance during
its dissolution.

A review of particular part of the above film
will present a visual duplicate of what I observed,
and tried to describe in my report and in Form 164.

I trust this will be helpful in evaluating this
sighting.

Very truly yours,

[signature blacked out]
