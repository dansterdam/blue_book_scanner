Description of object:
I saw the object moving from west to east overhead. I first noticed it about over the crest of the Palisades. It appeared about the size of the full moon at mid-sky, shining silvery metallic color, no visible vapor trail. It was in sight about 8 to 10 seconds, disappearing from sight in the western sky. It's shape appeared slightly elliptical, the long axis in the direction of flight.
