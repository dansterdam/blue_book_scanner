AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Intelligence Officer
Bryan Air Force Base, Texas

DI-70-52 (ATRC)    PAGE    2    OF    3    PAGES

On or about 0905 hours, 27 September 1952, an unidentified object, flying at great speed, was observed by two persons, 1/Lt. JAMES E. PARMALEE, an instructor, and Cadet GEORGE R. BOHON, a student, both assigned to the 3520th Pilot Training Group, Bryan Air Force Base, Texas. Both persons were flying a T-33 jet Aircraft, number 4534. This was on a flight of four planes. The flight took off from Bryan Air Force Base at 0725 hours, 27 September 1952 and aimed to an altitude of approximately 35,000 feet near HEMPSTEAD, Texas, which is approximately fifty (50) miles east of Houston, Texas, the flight was on a heading of three hundred (300) degrees at an altitude of thirty nine thousand (39,000) feet with him sighting the object.

Lieutenant PARMALEE saw the object first and called to Cadet BOHON to observe it. The instructor had happened to look up at the sky and had seen "a circular object, appeared somewhat white or silvery." Practically overhead, both men saw the object to be about fifteen (15) to twenty five thousand (25,000) feet above them, or at an altitude of fifty five (55) to sixty five thousand (65,000) feet. It moved somewhat erratically and appeared to be very maneuverable and traveled at an estimated speed of six hundred (600) to seven hundred (700) miles per hour.

The object was observed for two (2) or three (3) minutes. Both men agreed that the object was definitely not a cloud or a plane. It seemed to bank to the vertical as with a conventional jet, and although it appeared to be a faint sixty area to the rear of the object, there was no exhaust trail. The planes in the vicinity were flying left until close and one and one half (1 1/2) times the size of a line or a little larger.

At the time of the sighting the visibility was perfect and at no time did the object appear to be metallic in color but seemed to be white.

Both men were experienced in flying and are familiar with aircraft. Lieutenant PARMALEE has approximately three hundred (300) hours of flying time, Cadet BOHON has approximately twenty five (25) hours of flying time.

Neither man at the time of the flight did observe the object, either because of difficulty in visibility or neglect in orienting the objects position in relation to their own aircraft.

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:
Both men gave the appearance of serious minded individuals who were not inclined to exaggerate and are considered fairly reliable.

SUMMARY: (Use numbered paragraphs. Give only essential information per paragraph. List references at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part II.)

On or about 0905 hours, 27 September 1952, an unidentified flying object was seen by 1/Lt. JAMES E. FARNHAM, Instructor, and Cadet Student, both assigned to Bryan Air Force Base, Texas. The sighting was made over HEMPSTEAD, Texas (30 00'N 96 15'W) from a T-33 jet aircraft on a heading of three hundred (300) degrees at thirty (30,000) feet altitude.

The object was first directly over the aircraft at about fifteen (15) to twenty (20) degrees above the horizon, appearing as a small, white, circular object. It was definitely circular, appeared more white than silvery and at great speed and slow-drifted across the sky. It was in sight for two (2) minutes in a south to north direction. It was approximately one (1) mile in diameter, jet trail was noted to bank nearly vertical and did not appear to be a cloud or reflection and did not seem to be a conventional aircraft.
