11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Very bright light with halo of diffused light encircling to appeared off right wing of a/c at 15 angle, observed to and described as round, white or orange in color. Varied from 3-5 min. Object was observed from C-119 by traveling at an approx speed of 1° along an alt of 7500'.

COMMENTS: 1. 4 out of the 6 observers state that the object was a solid, star-like object. The other 2 do not recall themselves. All agree it was bright, near.

2. Object remained stationary off right wing and was seen for 3 minutes. The planet Venus offers a possible explanation but is in the proper position of the object.

The document appears to be a hand-drawn diagram with lines, arrows, and annotations, with some text that is partially illegible. The diagram seems to show some kind of trajectory or positioning of objects, with "Venus" marked at one point and "1350" written on the side.

Tunis, Libya                                                                11 February 1953

I.   Description of Incident

An unidentified object was observed by the crew of a C-119 aircraft while enroute to Tripoli from Tunis. The object appeared very bright with a halo of diffused flight surrounding it and was observed off the right wing of the aircraft flying at 7,000' on a 170° heading making 1A.S. of 170 knots. Length of observation varied from 5 to 55 minutes by assorted members of the crew some of whom stated that it appeared to ascend and then descend slowly.

II.  Discussion of Incident

Four out of six of the crew stated that, in their opinion, the object was not a star, whereas the remaining observers would not commit themselves on a conclusion. Since the sighting seemed to be astronomical in nature, Project Blue Book was able to 1) to 1A3 astronomy, standard operating procedure in such cases. It was determined that Venus was probably responsible for the observation in that it appears at an approximate 200° azimuth in Libya on this date, and under fair weather conditions would appear very bright. The fact that it remained almost stationary and was observed for a long period of time would support this conclusion.

III. Conclusion

Probably Venus.

I can only partially read the text on this page. The text appears to be:

"... I would like this to you ... and would like ... investigation. Living ..."

There is a section in the middle of the document that is blacked out/redacted with a black bar.

The image appears to be a typewritten document with some lines of text, but much of it is difficult to read due to the poor image quality and partial redaction.
