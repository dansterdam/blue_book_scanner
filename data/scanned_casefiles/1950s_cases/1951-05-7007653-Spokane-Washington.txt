CFG 319.1                                                31 May 1951

SUBJECT: Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft

TO:   Commanding General
       Air Materiel Command
       ATTN: MCXS
       Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
       Dayton, Ohio

1. In accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5, Air Defense Command Letter 200-1, dated 11 April 1951, subject as above, the following report of an unconventional aircraft or object, which was sighted over this field, is forwarded for your information;

    a. Description- The object was elliptical and flat in appearance, similar to a large sheet of paper or a thin aircraft wing. It was light sun tan color. No noise nor visible exhaust were present. The object moved over the field from the NNW slowly, at approximately 2500-5000 ft above the surface (estimated). In a wallowing manner, it hovered over the field and then ascended rapidly out of sight at approximately a 60 degree angle.

    b. The object was sighted at approximately 0918P, 29 May 1951. Duration of sight, approximately 4 minutes. It disappeared from sight in approximately 20 seconds after it started to ascend.

    c. The object was sighted with the naked eye by observers on the ground. No aircraft was in the air over the field at the time, nor were radar observations attempted.

    d. Source of information is reliable and authentic, 2 officers (pilots) and 2 airmen reported seeing the object.

    e. Weather conditions over the field at the time the object was sighted were:
       (1) Surface observation Geiger Field, US Weather Bureau
           0930P GEE - -015030 220/50/25/./011/300-0500

8000 ft 300/02        20000 ft 240/35

2. In the opinion of the station weather officer, neither the convective activity nor the synoptic situation over the area could likely have caused a large piece of paper to float in the air and ascend at time of incident. Towering cumulus clouds were observed to the N and NE over the mountains, but there were no clouds directly over the field at the time of incident.

3. Shortly thereafter, at approximately 0943P, a passenger in a T-6 aircraft approximately 40 miles SW of Geiger Field route to Larson AFB at approximately 3500 ft above the surface, sighted an object high in the sky to the SE of the aircraft. The object was reported to be circular and had a glistening appearance. Duration of sight- approximately 20 seconds.
