SUBJECT: Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft

        Dayton, Ohio

1. In accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5, Air Defense Command Letter 200-3, dated 11 April 1951, subject as above, the following report of an unconventional aircraft or objects, which was sighted over this field, is forwarded for your information:

a. Description- The object was elliptical and flat in appearance, similar to a large silver disc or perhaps a thin aircraft wing. It was light silver in color. No noise nor visible exhaust were present. The object moved over the airfield from the northeast and crossed on a southwesterly heading at a greatly accelerated pace, hovered momentarily, then descended and landed on the field and then ascended rapidly out of sight at approximately a 60 degree angle.

b. The object was sighted at approximately 0918P, 29 May 1951. Duration of sight, approximately 4 minutes. It disappeared from sight in approximately 30 seconds after it started to ascend.

c. The object was sighted with the naked eye by observers on the ground. No aircraft was in the air over the field at the time, nor were radar observations attempted.

d. Source of information is reliable and authentic, 2 officers (pilots) and 2 airmen reported seeing the object.

e. Weather conditions over the field at the time the object was sighted were:
(1) Surface observation Geiger Field, US Weather Bureau

GPG 319-1 Subject: Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft
(a) Wind aloft, Geiger Field, US Wea Bur 16602 (C3502)
2000 ft 180/05 9000 ft 300/02
5000 ft 210/05 10000 ft 320/03

8000 ft 300/02 20000 ft 240/35

In the opinion of the observer, the reported object was probably a weather observation type of aircraft, but neither convective activity nor the synoptic situation over the area could likely have caused a mirage which might appear to float in the air and ascend at time of incident. Powering cumulus clouds were observed to the N and NE over the mountains, but there were no clouds directly over the field at the time of incident.

So definitely a metrological observation, at approximately 0945P, a passenger in a T-6 aircraft approximately 40 miles SW of Geiger Field enroute to Larson AFB, called the object and had a glittering appearance as it ascended high in the sky over the surface, reported to be circular and had a glittering appearance. Duration of sight - approximately 20 seconds.
