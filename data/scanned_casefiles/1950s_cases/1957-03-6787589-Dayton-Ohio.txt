There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a Project 10073 Record Card with various fields filled out, including the date, location, type of sighting, source, number of objects, course, and conclusions. The text on the record card is as follows:

22 March 1957
Dayton, Ohio 
Local: 1300-1305=1319
Case: 2-23-57-32 
Type of Observation: Ground-Visual
Object: One 
SOURCE: Civilian
Number of Objects: One
COURSE: Stationary
CONCLUSIONS: Was Balloon
Could be Weather Balloon
Possibly Balloon
Was Astronomical
Possibly Astronomical
Other: Insufficient Data for Evaluation

As this coincides with release of weather balloons from Sulphur Grove these sightings are most logically a wx balloon.

The letter describes an observed object in the southeastern sky on March 25, 1957, which was visible from approximately 5:30 p.m. until 7 p.m. The letter asks for any information regarding the sighting and thanks the recipient for their assistance.

WPAB, Dayton, O.

Gentlemen:

Last Friday night an object was spotted in the southeastern sky about 5:30 p.m. It continued to be visible until about 7 p.m. when it was no longer possible to see it because of the darkness. People who saw it described it as having a red or ruddy colored base with a shiny, silvery-type appearance that appeared to be miles away. From your base, do you have any record of it having been seen from other points? We would appreciate any information you can give concerning what it was. The object was first spotted by youngsters. They thought it was a new planet--their own discovery.

We would appreciate any information you can give concerning what it was. The object was first spotted by youngsters. They thought it was a new planet--their own discovery.

Thanks for what you can tell us.

P.S. It's got my curiosity aroused -- I couldn't see it, although I tried. Too many obstacles -- buildings, trees etc. in my vision.

TRANSCRIPT:

The Evening Leader
Warren, Ohio

Dear Miss _________,

Your letter of 25 March 1957 to the Public Relations Office, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has been referred to this Center for reply.

We are of the opinion that the object sighted in your area about 5:20 P.M. on 23 March 1957 was a balloon which had been released in this area about that time. Similar objects were reported from the general area during the specific time and may present some unusual effects and characteristics when observed, but our investigation indicates that they were balloons of which there will be a number released in this area from time to time for various experimental purposes as shown by the recovery data below.

We have also included a copy of the summary of our Project Skyhook Special Report 144, which may be worth to you.

We appreciate your interest in the matter, and we are glad to have the opportunity to serve you.

Sincerely,

ROBERT E. O'CONNOR 
Captain, USAF
Assistant Adjutant
