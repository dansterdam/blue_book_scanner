Gentlemen:

Last Friday night an object was spotted in the southeastern sky about 5:30 p.m. It continued to be visible until about 7 p.m. when it was no longer possible to see because of the dusk. People who saw it described it as having a red or ruddy colored base with a bright, shiny top, that it appeared to be miles away. In Do you know if this was a weather balloon sent up from your base or do you have any record of it having been seen from other points? Observers here said it was moving very slowly but that they were unable to distinguish for sure whether it was a balloon. One observer estimated it was 60 miles or more away.

We would appreciate any information you can give concerning what it was. From where it might have been sent up, where it came down etc. The object was first spotted by youngsters. They thought it was a new planet-- their very own discovery.

Thanks for what you can tell us.
                                    Editor

P.S. It's got my curiosity aroused-- I couldn't see it, although I tried. Too many obstacles -- buildings trees etc in my vision.

The Evening Leader

Dear Miss:

Your letter of 25 March 1957 to the Public Relations Office, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has been referred to this Center for reply.

We are of the opinion that the object sighted in your area about 5120 PM, 22 March was a weather balloon with no near locally just before sunset. Our files reveal that several sightings of the same object were reported from the general area during the specific times you mentioned. These balloons reach an altitude of four to six miles, and can present some unusual effects and characteristics when observed under their conditions. We have enclosed a rough sketch which will help to explain the peculiar effects sometimes observed when sun is below the horizon.

We have also enclosed a copy of the summary of our Project Bluebook Special Report #14 which may be useful to you.

We appreciate your interest in the matter, and we are glad to have the opportunity to serve you.

Sincerely,

ROBERT E. O'CONNOR
