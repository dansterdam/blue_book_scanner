Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

I would say I observed this object from across the street. The object was round, had a light underneath, and appeared to be hovering above the ground, approximately 50 to 100 feet in the air. The object remained stationary for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing out of sight.

Dear Sirs: - In my own way I will try to explain. And as to the data you see - I was not sure as to just what facts to tell. I saw something in the sky. But as to the time it happened and the direction it was traveling, I am sure as to what I saw down as described. About 11:30 p.m. on May 21, 1952, I was ready to retire. I looked out the window and saw a strange bright light moving rapidly in an east to west direction. It appeared to be larger than a star and brighter. It moved very rapidly and then seemed to stop, then suddenly it disappeared and then reappeared again, repeating this several times. I watched it for about 2 or 3 minutes. It was a clear night and I could see the stars very well. I watched the strange light until it disappeared completely. I would be glad to discuss this further if you have any other questions. I looked at the time and noticed it was 11:35 p.m. when the object disappeared.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"Would have a seli of a 'Vidget' craft observed at 2300 on the night of Aug 8, 1952 on the east side of Detroit, Michigan. the craft seemed to be proceeding to the southwest at a high rate of speed, low to the ground and at times hovering. It was observed for 15 to 20 minutes and seemed to take on the appearance of a silvery disc or object. The movement and manuvers of the craft seemed to be controlled and directed, not just random. The craft was also observed to change color from a silvery white to a reddish orange. During the period of observation of the craft there were sudden bursts of acceleration at high speeds, the craft would appear to move from one area of the sky to another area some distance away in what seemed to be a matter of seconds. The movement was jerky and rapid and the craft had the appearance of being under control and directed. It was also observed that at times the craft seemed to be surrounded by a reddish orange glow or exhaust. the color, movement, and maneuvers of the craft were such that it could not have been any type of conventional aircraft. The sighting was witnessed by [REDACTED] and several other persons. The incident has been reported to the Air Force and Project Blue Book."
