Dear Sirs:- In my own way I will try to explain. Am not sure as to the date Aug 7th. But am sure you could find out from Saturday. First if you want that information. But as to the time I am sure as to what I put down in this report.

About 11-30 PM [redacted text] myself started to get ready to retire. We had a light lunch went to bed room to change clothes, then to bath room. Then just before going to bed Both [redacted text] I went to kitchen to get a cigarette. I looked at the time was just past midnight. I walked to the front of this big window house & sat down in front of this big window looking out. My wife came to & stood in front of the window & we both noticed the light.

His thought it a big or huge star. But as we watched it would sort of jump up & down & AT times it would sort of turn to one side & when it did so it


- page 4 -

Would have a sort of a Reddish Cant. We could
see the shape only the light. We watched this up the
window for awhile & then went out on the front porch.
The lights seemed the same. We slowly decided to
call Selfridge Field when the light moved to the right
which is north a very slow could hardly see
it move. After it moved north it seemed to stay
to go north west which would be directly away
from us. Well, I was on the phone talking to
Selfridge Field (name blacked out) stood there
for a minute or so & walked to the door
to see where the light was. It was gone.
She came back & told me & I repeated
same to the officer. I was talking to. I hope
I have made this clear & of service to you
its pretty hard to describe something when
all you can see is light & when in the air
hard to judge distance.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Base Intelligence 575th ABG, Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan

REPORT NO. | PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

On the morning of 7 August 1952 at 0005g, Mr. [redacted] Whitcomb, Detroit, Michigan sighted an object in the sky over northern Detroit, Michigan. The object appeared to be white or a large star and white in color, changing intermittently to red. No exhaust or sound was noticed by the observer. The speed of the object was estimated at approximately 100 to 150 miles per hour. The object appeared to stand motionless for a period of fifteen or twenty minutes, then drifted to the NW and disappeared by drifting out of range of vision. The object was first sighted at 0005g and was observed until 0036g. Observation was visual ground only.

The investigation could not estimate the altitude or the object, but the object was located to the north of the observer. An angle of approximately 30 degrees from the ground was a single or at height.

Existing weather was: Clear sky, fifteen mile visibility, with wind from the NE at five miles per hour.

Two jets took off at 2356g and had been within 30 miles NW of Selfridge to 50 miles NNE of Selfridge. At 0035g the jets were approximately 70 miles NW of Selfridge. No other known aircraft were in the area. Detroit Lincoln Airport is in the area near sighting.
