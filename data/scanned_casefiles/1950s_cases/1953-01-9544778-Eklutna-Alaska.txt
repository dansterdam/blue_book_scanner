The text in the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
HEADQUARTERS 
HEADQUARTERS OF ALASKA
23 January 1953
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Eklutna, Alaska
1. On 21 January 1953, Mr. Richard F. Prather, a civilian employee of the 6400th Air Intelligence Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, reported observing an unusual aerial object.
2. At approximately 1735 hours, 21 January 1953, Mr. Prather was riding in a government vehicle near Eklutna, Alaska, when he observed an unidentified aerial object at an estimated altitude of 200 to 300 feet. The object appeared to be about 20 to 25 feet in diameter and had an orange-red color. After observing the object for about 10 to 15 seconds, it rose vertically at a rapid rate and disappeared from view.
3. No weather or other type balloons were released in this area near the time of the observation.
4. The object was observed under clear weather conditions.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
1-19-53
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon, Anchorage, Alaska
This document furnished to the U. S. AAF District Intelligence Office, 
Anchorage, Alaska. 
Lt. Henry Stake, circuit #3, HAZ, Anchorage, Alaska. 
Subject:   At approximately 6:15 AM on 1-16-53, Lt. STEPHEN HENSLEY observed a bright object in the sky to the south, apparently hovering approximately 30 miles from Anchorage, Alaska. The object appeared as a single bright light, slightly larger than a star and with a luminescence greater than a planet. It maintained a relatively fixed position in the sky for approximately 30 minutes, then began to move in a northerly direction at a very high rate of speed. The object quickly diminished in size and eventually disappeared from view. 
Lt. STEPHEN HENSLEY, the observer, is considered to be a reliable and conscientious officer. His report is considered to be accurate and factual. The time of observation, weather conditions, and the general description of the object are consistent with other reports received from the Anchorage area. 
Although the newspaper article indicated unusual and unexplained sightings of this nature are becoming quite prevalent and believe that use of the binoculars may have contributed to the sighting, there was no sound, trail, or exhaust associated with the object. 
Sightings of this nature have been of increasing frequency in the Anchorage area and may have some significance in the overall problem of unidentified aerial phenomena.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON  

On 9 January 1953 at approximately 7:40 P.M. Alaska Standard Time a witness observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon over Eklutna, Alaska. The witness, who wishes to remain anonymous, observed the object for approximately one minute and described it as being about 200 feet in diameter, silvery in color, and elliptical in shape. According to the witness, the object was observed at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet and was traveling in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of approximately 200 to 300 miles per hour. No exhaust or trail was observed emanating from the object. When first sighted the object was traveling in level flight and then suddenly climbed vertically at a high rate of speed and was soon lost to sight. The witness is a reliable person and his report is considered to be credible.
