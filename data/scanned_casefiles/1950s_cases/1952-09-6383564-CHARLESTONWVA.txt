Unusual Phenomena Observed by Aircrew

1. A pilot report of an unusual nature involving phenomena observed by
crew members of a B-29 while on a flight 24 September 1952, south of Charleston,
W. Va., was received by Detachment 7, 4th Weather Group, Griffiss Air Force
Base, Rome, New York. The number and home station of the aircraft and the names
and organization of the crew members were not included in the report forwarded to
Hq Air Weather Service and sent from that headquarters to Hq MATS.

2. The report is as follows:

    a. Date:   24 September 1952
    b. Time:   1530E
    c. Location: 50 miles due south of Charleston, West Virginia
    d. Type of aircraft: B-29
    e. Indicated Altitude: 19,000 feet
    f. Altimeter Setting: 30.26 inches (Hg)
    g. Indicated Airspeed: 190 knots
    h. Remarks: The aircraft was on a track of 350 degrees toward
Charleston, West Virginia. When 100 miles south of that city near the
the crew observed bright, metallic-appearing particles streaming past the
aircraft. The particles were visible from all observation points in the
plane and were observed by all crew members. The particles appeared to be
pencil-point in width and variable in length from a tiny flash to a streak
over three-four long. These flashes and streaks were visible at a considerable distance approaching the plane and at a distance of 80 to 100
feet to the sides of the plane. Nothing was observed to hit the plane (wing
edges, windshield, props, or plane surface) but flowed smoothly past the
plane. Somewhere could see the trajectory from the slipstream and to the rear
of the plane. It was agreed that the streaks were in the form of a bright,
white light and no spectrum was observed at any time. There were no turbulence
and no condensation trails. The indicated free air temperature was -10.00C,
corrected for altitude to -6.00C. There were no clouds encountered but cirrus
type clouds were visible in the distance, both to the east and west of flight
path. As an estimated 12,000 feet and at least 10 to 15 miles from the flight
path. The phenomenon was observed for a distance of 50 miles and ended approximately 50 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia. Approximately one hour
earlier (1430) the plane had covered the same path northward from Charleston, West
Virginia, on a track of 170 degrees and the phenomenon was not observed.

3. The detachment commander and detachment forecaster interviewed the
pilot and engineer of the aircraft and also a crew member from the tail section
of the aircraft in an effort to correlate the crew's report with known weather
phenomena. However, no satisfactory explanations or conclusions were reached.
The pilot stated emphatically that the particles were not ice crystals nor were
they in any way similar to chaff or dropped to disrupt radar observations.

4. The Directorate of Scientific Services, Air Weather Service, reviewed
the report and stated that AWS could offer no explanation for the reported
phenomena. It was recommended that the matter be called to the attention of
Project Bluebook, Air Technical Intelligence Center.
