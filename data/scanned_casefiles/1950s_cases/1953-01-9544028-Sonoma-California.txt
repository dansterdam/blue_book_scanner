SUBJECT: FLYOBJ

In accordance with AGL 200-3, dated 29 April 1952, subject: Unidentified Flying Object Reporting (Short Form), FLYOBJ), the following report on an unidentified flying object is submitted:

On 10 January 1953, between 1545 hours and 1800 hours, PST (23452 and 24002), Colonel W. J. Mack, USAF (Ret) and Mr. Jack Cook of the Federal Security Agency, San Francisco, California, observed an unidentified flying object while at a (3) miles northwest of Sonoma, California, from a knoll in the hills northwest of the Sonoma Valley. The object was sighted at a 45° high angle northwest from the location of the observers at a very high altitude, so high that the object was compared to the flat head of a pin from the observers' point of view. It was estimated at Four times the speed of a jet aircraft with accompanying sound similar to the USAF F-86 jet as high altitude. There was no change in sound none or little during maneuvers. Unusual maneuvers by the object were: (1) - Three (3) 90° right turns to the right, taking 2 to 3 seconds to complete each turn;
(2) - Two (2) right angles (90°) turns, first to the right, then to the left); (3) - The object slowed down to almost a complete stop, then accelerated to high speed, making this maneuver somewhat bulbous. The object then rose vertically and disappeared from view. Total time of observation was estimated to be between 50 and 75 seconds. There were no radar contacts with this object. No other observations of this object are known to have been made.

On 15 January 1953 at 1135 hours PST (10582), one Colonel
USAF, (retired), appeared and was interrogated at the Office of the Director of
Intelligence, Hamilton Air Force Base, Hamilton, California, stating he had
observed an unidentified flying object. A tape recording of this information
was made and is forwarded with this report as Enclosure #1. Information contained therein is as follows:

Name and address of Observer:    (1) Colonel    USAF (Ret'd)
                                 Sonoma, California

(2) Federal Security Agency
    San Francisco, California

Interrogated by:
    Captain M. M. Johnson, USAF

    Hamilton Air Force Base, Hamilton, California

1.  Description of Object:
    Shape:                       Unknown due to high altitude.
    Size:                        About the size of a pin-head held 2 feet from
                                 the eye.
    Color:                       Silvery, possibly due to reflection of sun
                                 against aircraft's-type covering.
    Speed:                       Great speed. Estimated as 4 times the speed
                                 of a jet aircraft.
    Sound:                       Similar to sound of an F-86 at high altitude,
                                 with no change in tone or volume during maneuvers.
    Maneuvers:                   The object made three (3), 360° turns to the
                                 right taking 2 to 3 seconds to complete each
                                 turn. These turns were made at 5 second intervals still holding on the same course. It
                                 continued on and made an abrupt right angle
                                 (90°) turn to the right, followed 5 seconds
                                 later with an abrupt turn to its original course.
                                 After this maneuver, the object slowed down
                                 to almost a stop and then accelerated to its
                                 previous speed, making this maneuver twice.
                                 The only point rose very vertically and disappeared from view. (The observer stated that
                                 the object could possibly have been climbing)

when it seemed to slow down to a stop but that he
periodically doubted it). The 330° turns were said
to be very tight turns, about one-eighth (1/8th)
of area around for jet aircraft.

Trails or Exhaust:        None observed.
Propulsion System:        Not reported.
Number of Objects:        One (1)
Manner of Disappearance:  Object rose vertically and disappeared from view
                           to the northwest.
Other Pertinent or
Unusual Features:         The glinting did not change during the maneuvers.

2. Time of Sighting:
    Local Time:            Between 1540 hrs and 1600 hrs, 10 Jan 53
    Cobra Time:            Between 25352 and 26002, 10 Jan 53
    Length of Time Observed: From 60 to 75 seconds by Colonel [redacted]. He
                           saw object 10 seconds later when Colonel [redacted]
                           pointed it out to him, due to the objects
                           terrible speed and high altitude.

3. Manner of Observation:  Visual without aids. The 20th Air Division (Defense)
                           reported no radar contacts with this object during
                           this time and date report.

4. Location of Observers During Sighting:
    Eight (8) miles northwest of Sonoma, California, from a knoll in the hills
    northwest of Sonoma Valley near the crest of Trinity Road connecting the Sonoma
    and Napa Valleys. The object was sighted at a 30° angle northwest of position
    of the observers. Distance of object from observers was undetermined, flying
    at a very high altitude in a northwest direction. Altitude was determined to be
    approx than 20,000 ft by jet aircraft.

5. Reliability of Information:
    Colonel [redacted] stated he had a total of over 1,000 hours flying time and is
    familiar with various types of aircraft. However, he stated that Mr. Hunter's
    background does not indicate much familiarity with aircraft.

6. Weather, Winds and Visibility at Time and Place of Sighting:
    Observers Report: The sun was dropping in the west. Visibility was good.
    Ceiling was unlimited with sufficient light for good observation.

Sonoma, California                                                10 January 1953

I. Description of Incident

At 2245 two civilian sources observed one small flying object moving at a great rate of speed and performing violent maneuvers. The object's sound was similar to that of a jet aircraft. The object made three 360° right turns in nine seconds then performed abrupt 90° turns first to the right, then to the left. The object then stopped, accelerated to its former speed, rose vertically and disappeared.

II. Discussion of Incident

The only known aerial object capable of appearing to go through the described maneuvers would be a balloon, however, the time factors and velocity estimates do not support this conclusion.
