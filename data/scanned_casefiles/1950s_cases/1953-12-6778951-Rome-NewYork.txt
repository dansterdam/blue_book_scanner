REPORT INVESTIGATION -- AVIS TWO-ENGINE JET PLUME IN VICINITY OF ROME, NEW YORK

THIS REPORT TELLS THE EXPLANATION IN DETAIL OF THE INCIDENT OF OBJECED SEEN IN VICINITY OF ROME, NEW YORK. IT APPEARS THAT THIS INCIDENT REPRESENTS WHAT WE CALL. PROPERLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY AS A NATURAL PHENOMENON OF NATURE.

IT WAS AT FIRST THOUGHT TO BE AN UNUSUAL OBJECT AND UPON FIRST SIGHT, AND FROM APPEARANCE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A STRANGE FLYING OBJECT. HOWEVER, ON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT WAS FOUND TO BE CAUSED BY THE EXHAUSTED PLUME OR TAIL PIPE EMISSIONS FROM A COMMERCIAL TWIN-ENGINE JET AIRCRAFT PASSING THROUGH THE AREA. THE AIRCRAFT WAS IDENTIFIED AND FURTHER CHECK UP REVEALED THAT THE EMISSIONS FROM THE TAIL PIPE OR ENGINES CREATED THE UNUSUAL APPEARANCE WHICH CAUSED THE REPORT TO BE MADE.

THIS REPORT APPROVES THE NATURAL EXPLANATION AND CLEARS UP THE QUESTION OF THE STRANGE OBJECT SEEN BY SEVERAL OBSERVERS IN THE AREA.

METEORS

By mariners reporting their observations of these bodies are greatly assisted in learning the regions desired to have the observations of mariners made possible, whether by bearing in altitude, or by relation to fixed stars, or both.

Computations on the observations on these trails and their direction of drift should be made as soon as posssible, since this wind direction is the upper wind direction at the altitudes at which the observations were made.

Gulf of Mexico
Second Officer Kenneth Davis of the American SS Esro Linden, Frankfort, master, reports the following meteor observation: 

AT 0010 U. S. T., December 12, 1953, in Lat, 26°44' N., long. 81 °00' W., a bright red and green meteor was observed bearing approximately 210° true, just 45 minutes after the moon had set. The meteor traveled in a horizontal direction for about a minute and a half, then exploded and disappeared, bearing about 260° true, at about 10° of arc above the horizon. Wind est, at temperature 80° F., sea temperature 80° F.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a sighting of a "flashing light" in the sky observed by Second Officer Holger Philipson of the Swedish ship "M.V. Stella" on December 15, 1953. The object was sighted at an altitude of 20°, was greenish in color, and lasted for about 3 seconds.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

CARIBBEAN SEA

CARIBBEAN SEA

Second Officer Holger Philipson of the Swedish ship M.V. Stella reported observing a flashing light just west of Canopus on December 15, 1953, at about 2340 Z. The light was at an altitude 20°, greenish in color, and lasted for about 3 seconds.
