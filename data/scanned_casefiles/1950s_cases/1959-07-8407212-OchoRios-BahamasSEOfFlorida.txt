Gentlemen,

I am only now that the elevation of the body is reasonably accurate, as the Pole Star was used as the reference point I had a reasonably length of time to cross check. This clear implies it the horizontal angle through a few min. angles of arc might be expected.

Imprecision only of high speed and great distance may can the given value to lack of my knowledge of height and distance.

I had hoped that a correlation being flying of position function...

Senior Officer,
U.F.O. Division,
Pentagon,
Washington D.C.
U.S.A.

Dear Sir,

If you cannot readily explain by tanker refuelling or controlled USCM activity, I feel you will be interested in this report of an otherwise unexplainable sighting of a UFO.

At 0024 2 on the evening of July 9th, on the North Coast of Jamaica drew the attention of myself and my First Officer to a strange light in the north. The sky was completely clear of cloud, and the stars bright in all quadrants as far as the eye could see.

The light was located slightly East of the North star on a course slightly East of South at an elevation of approximately 30°. As I located the object, it formed into a cigar shape of aura with the bright light at the Northern end implying an aircraft landing light shining through a light haze so that I considered this might be a passing aircraft signalling in an unaccustomed manner and listened for the motors.

Within a minute I realized this to be incorrect so endeavoured to obtain as accurate an impression as possible.

At 0122 2 direction changed to South East and was maintained until 01.12 at which time direction changed again to North East. In which direction the object became too dim to discern by 01.15 2.

During the observation the object changed position approximately 300 of horizontal angle while remaining at almost the same elevation. Light intensity was that of a 2nd magnitude star dimming only as it disappeared in the East.

July 10, 1959.

I have not yet attempted to calculate the speeds required to explain this sighting but will be pleased to assist in any way if you are unable to explain simply through your office.

Trusting this information is of some interest,

Yours very truly,

Strange object
seen moving
in the sky

A resident of Red Hills told the Gleaner last night that a bright object like Sputnik or a Flying Saucer with a long tail added, was seen moving across the sky from Northwest to Southwest last night.

Contact, Dr. E. C. McVille, president of the Jamaican Astronomical Society, said he had viewed the object through his telescope and to him it appeared to be three bright objects looking like stars but in motion. It might have been three jet planes or missiles, he added.

BUFF BAY, PA., July 9 (From our correspondent:) An object believed to be a satellite was seen here by many people at 8:20 p.m. It traveled in a northerly direction and was visible for over a minute.

JULY 10, 1959.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

On July 9th, at approximately six minutes after eight in the evening, I observed what at first - for a few seconds only - appeared to be a falling star. On looking directly at the lighted object, it appeared to be a star, the tall by this time had disappeared. After watching for approximately one minute, I drew the attention of Captain Jeckott to the object, which at this time appeared as an oval shaped glow of lighted area as if strong lights had been turned on and appeared to be at the sides and rear of the star-like centered point. This object this time was moving almost due South. In the course of seven minutes approximately, the course was changed as in a large crescent changing course through almost a full 100°. At various times through this pattern, it appeared as a large oval glow as a star and again as a combination of three stars, one central, brighter than the two trailing outside lights which appeared only briefly and occasionally. As it proceeded North and away from us, it disappeared in the distance. In appearance, it was at a tremendous height and appeared to twinkle as a star, during this whole time, there was no sound of any sort. This was seen by four others in our party and observed from the [redacted].
