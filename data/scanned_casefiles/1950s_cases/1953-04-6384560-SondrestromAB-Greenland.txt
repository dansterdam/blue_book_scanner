1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 2 April 53  0V/23002
2. LOCATION: Sondrestrom A.B., Greenland
3. SOURCE: USAF
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1 
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Aerial
7. COURSE: Descending
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Analyzed as (BALLOON)
It was believed by the Intelligence Officer of the 9th Air Division that the object observed was a balloon.
This light was observed for approximately 3 seconds and was estimated to be at an altitude of 30,000 feet. The object appeared to be descending.

UNCLASSIFIED

Sondrestromfjord Air Base, Greenland  8 April 1953

I. DESCRIPTION
At 2302, two observers flying MATS aircraft reported sighting an unidentified light 1 to 2 miles south of Sondrestromfjord Air Base, Greenland. The object was observed to be traveling in a northerly direction of travel at an estimated speed of 165 knots. The object maintained a steady course, but seemed to be in a shallow descending turn. The observing aircraft was at an airspeed of 165 knots and a true heading of 30 degrees. The white light was observed on the starboard side at approximately 20 to 30 degrees off the bow. The duration of the observation was approximately three seconds at a distance of 30 to 100 miles.

II. DISCUSSION
It was felt that there was a similarity between this sighting and the Reykjavik, Iceland, sighting of 1 April 1953. It was the opinion of the Director of Iceland Defense Forces that this was the selected phenomenon. The description of this light fits that of a meteor, except that a meteor very seldom appears white. However, Professor Bjork concurred with the MSAF evaluation when its contract astronomer also was of the opinion that the phenomenon was astronomical in nature.

III. CONCLUSION
Probably astronomical (Meteor).

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" from Project Blue Book, dated April 8, 1953.

The text in the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Incident: Unidentified flying object(s) 
Date/Time: 6 April 1953 
Place: Sondrestron AB, Greenland
Informant: Captain, USAF
GO: Sondrestrom, AB
Report of an unidentified flying object(s) observed by the crew of a B-36 aircraft on 6 April 1953 over Sondrestrom, AB, Greenland.
The object(s) were observed by the crew of the aircraft for approximately 10 minutes. The size of the object(s) was estimated to be approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter. The object(s) appeared to be metallic in nature and were observed to be in level flight at an estimated altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet above the ground. The object(s) were observed to make an abrupt change in direction and then accelerate at a high rate of speed and disappear from view.
It is the opinion of the Director of Intelligence that this incident is of sufficient importance to warrant this report.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the Ohio State University's Emerson McMillin Observatory to Lt. Robert Olsson, dated May 19, 1953.

The text of the letter is as follows:

19 May 53

Lt. lt. Robert Olsson 
Twilight-Patterson AFB.

Dear Lt. Olsson:

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April. 

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss _____ officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on each individual case that you will have my comments on each case. The uniform method I can handle is by typing and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only 2 really interesting cases. I might mention 5 April 28 March 52, Sccers APS, as the 1st report I've seen on an "Oid Venus" which have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those. 

The "Great Fall" (3 April) case was Venus if reported timesf was in error.

The 30 March Albrook AFP was probably Venus. Possibly have been 2 months the 3O March 1952, Venus. are puzzling but could have been something else.

The 8 April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.  

The 27 March San Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no radar picture. Vice is considering cases against that of astronomy in this type of thing, and for a pinch-bottle but it should be listed as Exceptional. The 29 March Spooner, Wisc. Duration Sping, people checking here. I tend to believe that object could have done all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one of the regularity checks should be more to fit Gillettes.

I'm forwarding to you the forms that were in this latest batch, and I hope you receive more data on it. Questionnaires should be sent if like to see Mongraphin this one. I't there any possibility that those could have been mirage? Apparently ducks have been mistaken.

As for the 26 (fish?) Phaenomena APS although the data are contradictory and insufficient, perhaps this was a helicopter. We ought to have much more information on this one. Has thin been received?

Sincerely,
C. Allen Hynek
