Sondrestromfjord Air Base, Greenland                                     8 April 1953

I.    DESCRIPTION

At 2300Z two observers flying a NATO aircraft reported sighting an unidentified white light 110 miles SW of Sondrestrom Air Base, Greenland. The estimated speed of this light was 1000 mph, altitude estimated to be 15,000 ft. and direction of travel 0°. The object maintained a steady course, but seemed to be in a shallow descending turn. The observing aircraft was at 9000 ft. with an airspeed of 165 knots and a true heading of 30°. The white light was observed on the starboard side at 50°, fading out at approximately 200 to the right. Total time of the observation was approximately three seconds at a distance of 50 to 100 miles.

II.   DISCUSSION

Flight plans were checked with Sondrestrom AFB, Narssarssuak AFB and the Iceland Defense Force with negative results. It was the opinion of the Director of Intelligence, NEAC, that this sighting was caused by a celestial phenomena. The description of this light fits that of a meteor, except that a meteor very seldom appears white. However, Project Blue Book concurred with the NEAC evaluation when its contacts were astronomical in nature.

III. CONCLUSION

Probably astronomical (Meteor).

25 April 1953                   2 April 1953

At 23:02, 2 April 1953, two observers, Captain Frederick Broman and Lieutenant Ralph W. Dick, flying MATS aircraft 4259, reported sighting an unidentified object (370lN/524W), 11 miles SW of Sondres for Air Base, Greenland.

Estimated speed of the white light was 1000 miles per hour, estimated to be 15,000 feet. Direction of travel 6 degrees. The object maintained a constant heading, with no observable turns.

The observed altitude was at 700 feet with an airspeed of 165 knots and a true course of 30 degrees. The white light was viewed on the starboard side of the aircraft. Observation was approximately 3 seconds at a distance of 56 to 100 miles.

It is the opinion of the Director of Intelligence, MATS, that the incident was a routine celestial accompaniment.

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson;

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss [redacted] officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each folder. The letter method has obvious drawbacks, But until that time comes and she can handle my typing and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only 4 really interesting cases. I might mention a 5th, 28 March 53, Scott AFB, which is the last report I've seen of an honest to goodness mirage. 6 Cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those.
8 April was a meteor error.

The Great Falls 3 April case was Venus if reported time was in error.

28 March Albrook AFB was probably Venus.
31 March Honshu, and 30 March Lyle, Wash., are puzzling but could possibly have been balloons.
The 8-April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.

This brings us to the interesting cases:
25 March San Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no radar pickup. Was there any aircraft like helicopters that might explain this. Don't think this is good enough for a pinch-hot but 1st should be listed as Nocturnal Meandering, Right.

29 March Spooner, Wisc. Duration times needs checking here. Hard to believe object could have done all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one of the regular questions/give should be sent to Girard, Gillette.

Next is the 12 April Stead AFB. I think this is the most interesting case of the batch, and I hope you receive more dope on it. Questionnaires should be sent. 1st like to see Nogel explain this one. Is there any possibility that these could have been aircraft? Apparently ducks have been eliminated.

As for the 26 March, Equasseur AFB although N/L, the data are reconsidered insufficient. Perhaps this was a helicopter? We ought to have much more information on this one. Has this been received?

Sincerely,
[Signature]
