1. All three "targets" i.e., all three "sightings" appear similar in nature. The very short time observed, and lack of any other confirming data prevent any positive analysis. The fact that the speeds reported were extremely high is an indication that the blips were widely spread out on the scope, and may very well have been separate "blips" not due to the same "target".

2. The "interference" from the other radar (which was recognized as such) would have appeared as "rabbit tracks" on the scope - being a number of dots, or tracks, usually curved or spiralling. These were not the targets referred to in the reports.

3. It is the opinion (which cannot be proven) that the targets observed were not "real" targets, but were examples of what unexplained paintings on a radar scope.

Unidentified Flying Objects

SUMMARY: (Give summary which highlights the salient features of narrative report. Begin narrative with AF Form 112. List inclosures, including number of pages)

1. On 14 Nov 57, radar surveillance sightings with ground electronic equipment (AF/Ops-All) at the Guspen radar station (51 degrees, 25 minutes, 05 seconds North; 09 degrees, 31 minutes, 55 seconds East) of the 601st ACWRON, Rothwesten, Germany, revealed three targets of unknown character.

2. All three targets were high speed in nature. The first target was initially detected at 1102.5 at 235 (22 nautical miles southwest of Herzberg Sovzone Airfield). The second target was located at 1743.5 at 1745 (13 nautical miles northeast of Morseberg Sovzone Airfield). The third target was detected at 1753.8 at 1805 (with Garmisch-Partenkirchen 10 nautical miles southeast of the West German-Czech border).

3. There was no evidence of abnormal electronic interference with regard to the target detected at 1102. However, an unusual amount of interference occurred at the time of the other two sightings. Investigation by reliable rather cautious and intelligent personnel both in satisfactory explanations for all interference other than the targets being reported.

        divided into two sectors. One proceeded LG 4020, 
        LH 4020, LH 4045, LJ 4020, LJ 2550 where it left 
        board. Second portion located LG 4215, LH 4345, 
        LH 4121, LJ 3050 where it left board.
    (e) Blip was painting clearly when it left bounds of 
        plotting board.

(3) Fire minutes (L1012 - L1062):
    (a) Ground-electronic (AM/TPS-11)(AM/TPS-24)
    (b) N/A
    (c) N/A

(4) Time and date of sighting:
    (a) L1001 - L1062, 14 November 57
    (b) Day

(5) Location of observer: 51 degrees 31 minutes 55 seconds E 
    (this is the location of Rothwesten, GAFB, USAF), Rothwesten, 
    Germany

(6) Identifying information of all observers:
    (a) N/A
    (b) Charles L. Flesck, S/Sgt, USAF; good reliability
    (c) Weather and winds aloft conditions at time and place of 
        sighting: good reliability

(7) Sightings: Negative due to location of target
    (a) Impossible due to speed and position of blip
    (b) Clipper 134 (DG-4) approx 193 Knots @ 7,000 ±t(this 
        was carried as track 693)

(11) This report is based primarily on the observations of 
     S/Sgt Flesck. Portions of the flight path were also 
     observed & carried by Capt. Marrant Officer, and members 
     of the 50lst ACWRON. All of them agreeing as to the high 
     speed nature of the object.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

The radar maintenance officer explained the unusual interference cited in Ltr. Kunstadt's observations as being caused by the antenna rotation rate and PRF relationships between Gunpost's MT/T251 and our Navy Son radar data. The latter is located 58 line of sight miles at 50 degrees 29 minutes 54 seconds North and 09 degrees 57 minutes 17 seconds East. Otherwise there does not seem to be answer for the phenomena in the targets being reported.
