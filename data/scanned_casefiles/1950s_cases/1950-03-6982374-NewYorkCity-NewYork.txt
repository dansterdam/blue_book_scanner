The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a city skyline at night, with a bright, glowing cloud or light formation above the cityscape. The city lights are visible as small points of light, creating a silhouette of buildings against the dark background. At the bottom right of the image, there is a date stamp or notation that seems to read "Mar 28, 1950 G 71084 C".

The most prominent feature is the bright, diffuse light or cloud formation that takes up a significant portion of the upper part of the image, creating a dramatic contrast with the dark cityscape below.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a white, elongated cylindrical or rod-like object against a dark, grainy background. The object is positioned at an angle and appears to be the main focus of the image. There are some circular markings or holes visible on the right side of the image. The photograph has a vintage, slightly blurry quality typical of mid-20th century photographic technology.

No legible text is present in this image.
