1. Description of Object: Object was a single, bright bluish colored light. Pilot thought he saw, in his peripheral vision, a dark object in the sky, then the object in his vision changed. The object appeared approximately 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the aircraft and about twenty (20) degrees to the right of the nose of the aircraft. Object observed from right to left in front of the aircraft, diving and gaining speed, to a position about ten (10) degrees to the left of the nose of the aircraft. Object turned back crossing back crossing left to right and, when about three (3) degrees right of the nose and approximately paralleled the course of the aircraft, about 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the aircraft, and about one mile in distance. Object continued a course for approximately twenty (20) seconds. Then the flame vanished.

2. Time of Sighting: At 1955(1) for approximately forty five (45) seconds.

3. Manner of Observation: Visual without optical aids from an F-94B aircraft at 30,000 feet as a speed of 260 Knots indicated airspeed.

4. Location of Observer: At the beginning of the sighting, pilot estimated his position over YALE 0000 (see attached drawing). Object appeared approximately over YALE 5957 about 5,000 feet above 5,000 feet above the aircraft. Pilot could not accurately judge the range of the object, but estimated it to be about 3 miles. Observer was pilot of aircraft, seated in front cockpit of F-94B. Radar Observer did not see the object, as he was trying to establish radar contact with the object. No radar contact was established, although radar was operating properly.

5. Identifying Information on Observer: Observer was pilot, a first lieutenant pilot has been in 68th Ftr-Intcp Sqdn. for eight months. He is a capable all weather fighter-interceptor pilot, and is steady and reliable.

6. Weather: Haze layer below 500 feet, clear skies, no moon, calm winds.

7. Other Activity Which Might Explain Sighting: None.

8. Physical Evidence: None.

9. Interception: Pilot attempted to follow object visually. When object vanished, pilot searched the area with aircraft radar with negative results.

S T A T E M E N T

I was returning from K-9, at an altitude of 30,000 feet on a heading of 155 degrees at 200 knots, inflation air speed. There were no clouds and no moon. At approximately 1955T over K-9 (USAF) I sighted an unidentified flying object emitting an intense blue "flare", approximately 4,000 to 5,000 feet above me at about 20 degrees to my right, tracking on an approximate heading of 135 degrees. At this time the object was flying at or about my speed. It crossed my track to about 10 degrees to the left of my nose, descended and turned back in and tracked back to my course and paralleled it. Position of the object at this time was about 3 degrees right of my aircraft and 1,000 to 2,000 feet above. I immediately started a climb. It continued in this position momentarily increasing speed and then the light went out. My Radar Observer was unable to establish contact with the object, although the radar was operating properly. I immediately contacted other GCI control aircraft and asked if there were any aircraft (F-94 type) in the area at or above 30,000 feet, because I first had presumed it to be a possibly the afterburner of an F-94, showing the characteristic of an afterburner. GCI informed me that there were no jet aircraft in the vicinity above 16,000 feet. At this time I checked left and right in a climb. But could not establish any radar contact. Earnest Tubbs, pilot, Lt. Skinner, M.L., immediately started climbing and heading toward my position. He notified me that he was doing so. He made no further transmission to me concerning the object. I was having trouble with getting one of my tip tanks to feed so I descended to a lower altitude to reach this position. I did not see the object again. I returned to Itazuke and landed at 2100I.
