SUMMARY: The following is a summary of information in the report:
On 15 MAY 1953, a civilian pilot, while flying a small private airplane, observed an unidentified flying object over Grand Junction, Colorado. The object was observed to be maintaining a relatively constant altitude and speed, and was followed visually for approximately 10 minutes.
DETAILED INFORMATION: The pilot, Captain, USAF (Res), while flying from Montrose, Colorado to Grand Junction, Colorado on a routine cross-country training flight, observed an unidentified object at approximately 8000 feet altitude in the vicinity of Grand Junction. The object was first sighted southeast of Grand Junction and was followed as it traveled in a northwesterly direction until lost from view near the Grand Junction Airport.
The pilot stated that the object appeared to be metallic in nature, reflecting sunlight, and was estimated to be approximately 30 feet in diameter. The object maintained a relatively constant speed, estimated at 400 to 500 mph, and appeared to be flying on a level course. No smoke or exhaust was observed.
The object was observed visually for approximately 10 minutes, during which time it covered a distance of 25 to 30 miles. The pilot made several attempts to close on the object but it outdistanced his aircraft.
The pilot stated that the object appeared to be operating at an altitude of 7000 to 8000 feet and was maintaining this altitude with no apparent changes. The object was observed to make no abrupt turns or changes in speed or direction during the sighting.
