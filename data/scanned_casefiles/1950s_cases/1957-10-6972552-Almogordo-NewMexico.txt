"10-6-1957

SUBJECT: CIVILIAN RESEARCH GROUP

INFORMATION AND PHYSICAL EVIDENCE INDICATING A CIVILIAN RESEARCH GROUP IS INCLUDED IN THE INCIDENTS REPORTED NEAR ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO, ON AUGUST 5-6, 1957.

PRIMA DONNA, THE USAF PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR, OR HIS AERIAL PHENOMENA BRANCH STAFF, DID NOT SEEM INCLINED TO FURNISH ANY INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS MATTER. HIS EVASIVE REPLIES AND RELUCTANCE TO DISCUSS IT INDICATED THAT HIS SUPERIORS HAVE INSTRUCTED HIM TO WITHHOLD ANYTHING THAT MIGHT IDENTIFY OR INDICATE THE EXISTENCE OF THE CIVILIAN RESEARCH GROUP INVOLVED.

REPORTS OF WITNESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WERE SECURED THROUGH THE AFFIDAVITS AND INTERVIEWS OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND CITIZENS. CONSIDERABLE ROCK AND SOIL DISTURBANCE WAS OBSERVED. RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN CONFIRMED IN THE AREA WHERE THE OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED.

MEANWHILE, FOLLOWING OUR INQUIRIES, OFFICIALS FROM KIRTLAND AFB VISITED THE SCENE AND TALKED WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS. THEY HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED, SAID OR DID NOT IDENTIFY, SAID THE OBJECTS AS BEING OF UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ORIGIN.

AN ASTRONOMER FROM THE NEARBY OBSERVATORY SAID, "I LOOKED UP AND SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE DOZENS OF STARS ALL FLASHING ON AND OFF." HIS DAUGHTER, LEAVING FOR WORK AT THE TIME, SAID, "I LOOKED UP AND SAW A ROUND OBJECT IN THE SKY, AND IT SEEMED TO BE EMITTING A BLUE-GREEN FLAME. IT THEN DISAPPEARED TO THE NORTHEAST." HER STORY CORROBORATES THAT OF OTHER WITNESSES IN THE AREA.

PSYCHOLOGICAL DR. CARL JUNG OF SWITZERLAND MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO DISTURBANCES THERE DURING THAT PERIOD. THIS MAN IS QUOTED IN A BRITISH JOURNAL AS SAYING THAT SOME "FLYING SAUCERS" WERE REAL.

THESE THINGS ARE NO MORE RUMORS SOMETHING HAS BEEN SEEN."

CONVINCED IT'S AUTHENTIC

Flying Saucer 4,000 Feet In Diameter
Photographed At New Mexico Air Base

Alamagordo, N.M. (UP)--
A photograph of an "unconventional aerial object" was released today and an organization which has government employees in its membership but has no official status, said a government photographic expert could not challenge its authenticity. The object was released yesterday by a group of civilians at this missile test center.

The Aerial Phenomena Organization, which has its government employees in its membership but has no official status, said the picture was taken on Oct. 16, 1957. The weird huge object hovered for 15 minutes over the east missile test range near Holloman Air Force Base, the APRO claimed.

L.G. Lorenzen of Alamogordo, spokesman for the APRO, said the name of the photographer could not be revealed. He said the Hatch Air Force Base government employee from becoming involved in public controversy was such as the decade-old debate about whether flying saucers exist.

"Experts have examined the negative and all prints and pronounced it authentic," he said. He quoted the photographic expert: "It's definitely was not a cloud."

The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains a newspaper article with the title "Results Of 'Saucer' Hearings Reportedly Kept Secret".

The text in the article discusses the NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) and their investigation into UFO sightings. It mentions that the Air Force has been reluctant to make their findings on these investigations public, and that the NICAP has been critical of the Air Force's handling of the matter.

The article also mentions a "Medal of Honor Winner" at the bottom, but no further details are provided.

Here is the text from the article, transcribed as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system would:

Results Of 'Saucer' Hearings Reportedly Kept Secret

WASHINGTON (UP1) â€” A special Air Force intelligence chief reported Saturday that the findings of secret Congressional hearings on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have never been made public. The organization that conducted the hearings, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), insists the Air Force is withholding information about the hearings and the conclusions drawn from them. 

The NICAP said the refusal to make public the results of the hearings "borders on the ridiculous." It added that the public has a right to know what was learned about the nature and origin of the mysterious flying objects.

The NICAP said the hearings were held in October 1955 by a special subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. Air Force officials were called to testify, but the committee report has never been released. 

The organization said that the committee heard testimony from scientists, military pilots and other witnesses who had seen the objects. It said the hearings produced evidence that these objects are real and pose a potential threat to the security of the country.

The NICAP added that the committee was told the Air Force has been unable to identify the objects, determine their origin or explain how they are able to perform the maneuvers they have been observed making. 

The NICAP said it was informed that the committee recommended the Air Force make a full public report on its findings but that this was never done.

The image contains a photograph of a man identified as Dr. Carl Jung, along with a lengthy text discussing Jung's views on the psychological aspects of UFO sightings. The text appears to be an excerpt from a report or article on the topic of "Flying Objects Real, Psychologist Insists".

Here is the text output from the document:

Flying Objects Real, Psychologist Insists
ALAMOGORDO, N. M., July 6 (AP)--Dr. Carl Jung, noted Swiss psychologist, said he believes the recent reports of analytical psychologists have valid material behind them, contrary to the Air Force's "creating panic" charge.
Jung's statements were made in the monthly bulletin issued by the Civilian Saucer Intelligence in New York, a small clipping center.
In the course of years, Jung has become a recognized authority on the subject of UFO's. He believes, he said, that certain there phenomenon are real and have psychic aspects that cannot be explained completely with existing knowledge.
The Swiss psychologist stated that he is convinced that the observations have proven unaccountable in psychological sense and must be received in good faith as reports about something that has been seen. 
"The data, reports, indicate, do not show that there have been sighted only dreams or illusions. They show signs of intelligent behavior," Jung stated. These observations "are such that no normal human projection into the unknown can reasonably account for them." 
The phenomenon, he continued, is so strange that one cannot dismiss them as mere products of imagination.
Jung is reported to work with the rather close circle of psychologists interested in UFO observations and that the research has indicated not only good mental stability of some of the witnesses, but also their thorough sincerity in reporting what they have seen.
What astonishes me most, Jung told the persons who interviewed him, is the frequent observation that the information is not limited to the visual senses alone. Sooner or later, we have what they call "fear-creating panic" among people who in the moment of sighting are usually calm and collected. The phenomenon, he said, stands apart from normal human experience and cannot be grasped in scientific concepts yet evolved. That is whey, he added, they have published an authentic report under the title "Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky."

The text on the page discusses various aspects of UFOs, including their purported capabilities, controversies surrounding their existence, and the attitude of the authorities towards investigating them.

Text from the document:

ALMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO, JULY 24, 1957 - AT APPROXIMATELY 1:30 A.M. AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY A RELIABLE WITNESS. 

PHYSICAL PHENOMENA. THIS SARCASTIC ORGANIZATION (CAPROI) WHICH HAS GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP, STATED THAT THIS OBJECT APPEARED IN THE SKY AND HAD A TREMENDOUS SPEED, ESTIMATED AT 4,000 MPH, AND CHANGES IN ITS LONGEST AXIS BY COMPUTING ANGLES OF 15 DEGREES AND 30 DEGREES.

IT CLAIMS THAT THIS WAS ONLY AN EDUCATED GUESS, AS ACTUALLY TIMING THE PICTURE UNTIL MARCH OF THIS YEAR WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED. LCDR NORMAN SAID: "THE APRG SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THE PICTURE COULD NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE; ACGUSEJ JUNG AMONG THE WORLD'S LEADING PSYCHIATRISTS, SAID THAT 'QUASI-HUMAN BEINGS' ARE AT THE CONTROLS OF FANTASTIC VEHICLES WHICH ARE OBSERVING US."

LCDR NORMAN SAID: "HE QUOTED THE AFPRG SPOKESMAN AS SAYING THAT UFOS COULD DO MANY THINGS THAT THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO ACCORDING TO KNOWN PHYSICS."

BRANCH: It is this office's conclusion, supported by that of ATIC Photo Analysis, that this object was a rare form of ice crystal. The so-called "circular type" formation was also common. At Holloman AFB, who reviewed the material, parallels those of this office's. Note should also be taken of the investigators' determination on the individual who took this photograph.
This office has no record of other UFO sightings from this area on purported data of this photograph.

1. The color transparency contained in this report has been examined, and it is the opinion of the specialists with this branch that it does not contain a physical object, as you have indicated.

2. It is suggested that the transparency be turned over to the Photo Lab, AFOTN-ho, with a request that an enlargement with this greatest magnification possible be made. In this type of an enlargement, the transparent edges of the object should prove it to be a cloud formation.

The text in the document reads:

NO interruption in the grading processing indicates the original transparency shows no interruption in the grading.  This gradually obliterates the clouds in the upper portion but the body of the object remains fixed in its original position.  The contour lines begin to appear which indicate the object is not saucer-shaped but rather of an unusual configuration.

In our investigation, no single clue was uncovered which in our files is listed as a UAO --- Unconventional Aerial Object.

The color transparency shows an unknown object hovering over the Holloman Air Force Base.  Included with the picture was an expert analysis and attribution.  We would like to call it a "luminous cloud", said L. J. Lorenzen, Public Relations Director of APRO.  He simply do not form over warn desert country at low altitude ---formation would not permit the master control of this type of object.  He further explained, "It was stationary when photographed and was observed in the same position for fifteen minutes."
