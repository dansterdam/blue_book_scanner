1. Subject: photograph and original 35MM negative is submitted to your office for subject action. Because of the nation-wide publicity given this photograph, and to obtain a composite of opinions from pertinent AF units. A brief background is desired.

2. The photographs and/or articles regarding the incident have been publicized in most of the nationally known magazines such as LIFE, NEWSWEEK and others, and, as we understand, some coverage given it by radio and TV. The Air Force will undoubtedly be asked to comment officially.

3. This office's original conclusion, when a large number of newspaper clippings photographs (one attached as Incl 2) were brought to its attention, was that a rare form of cloud formation known as the "lenticular cloud" type. A number of such photographs of this type have been received (see two examples, Incl. 2).

4. In reply to previous queries by the Office of Information Services, Headquarters, USAF, this Center stated that without the original negative, photo we had no comment other than our belief that it was a type of cloud as stated in previous correspondence. A request for originals resulted in receipt of the enclosures.

5. It should be noted that the conclusions of Research and Development, who reviewed the material, parallels those of this office.

6. It is requested that your comments be in some detail merely for future record or subsequent review of the case. Our findings will be made known to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, SAFIS-3, per their request.

ALAMOGORDO, N.M., AUG. 9.--(UPI)--A CIVILIAN RESEARCH GROUP
SAID TODAY IT HAS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE INDICATING A MATERIAL, EXTRA-
TERRESTRIAL BASIS FOR AT LEAST A PORTION OF UNIDENTIFIED
FLYING OBJECTS.

PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE AERIAL
PHENOMENA RESEARCH ORGANIZATION HERE, MADE THE STATEMENT AS NEW
MEXICAN NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST STANLEY LEINS THIS FRIDAY NIGHT.

SAID THE "PHYSICAL EVIDENCE" WAS SECURED "THROUGH THE
EFFORTS OF OUR WORLD WIDE ORGANIZATION." HE DID NOT GIVE FURTHER
DETAILS, EXCEPT TO SAY THE ORGANIZATION WAS CHECKING THE EVIDENCE.

MEANWHILE, A ROCKET ENGINEER AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS, N.M.
REPORTED SEEING A GROUP OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS NEAR THE
ALAMOGORDO MISSILE TESTING CENTER AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME WITNESSES
HAD SEEN A CLUSTER OF LIGHTS.

THE ENGINEER, WHOM THE ARPO DID NOT IDENTIFY, SAID THE OBJECTS
WERE YELLOWISH AND FLYING FROM THE SOUTHWEST TOWARD THE TESTING CENTER
AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 10,300 FEET.

THE ARPO SAID A CHECK WITH AIRPORTS IN THE AREA INDICATED NO
AIRCRAFT, CIVILIAN OR MILITARY PLANES IN THE AIR AT THE TIME--ABOUT
10:30 P.M.--AND NO WEATHER BALLOONS OR ROCKET LAUNCHINGS PLANNED
EARLIER, THE ARPO SAID NINE PERSONS HAD REPORTED SEEING MYSTERIOUS
OBJECTS AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME.

AN EMPLOYE OF THE ALAMOGORDO SCHOOL SYSTEM, -------- TOLD THE
ARPO'S FILTER CENTER "I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED IT IF I HADN'T SEEN IT
MYSELF."

HIS DAUGHTER, -------- 20, SAID, "IT LOOKED LIKE DOZENS OF STARS ALL
IN A CLUSTER, WEAVING IN AND OUT OF THE CLOUDS. IT MOVED TOWARD THE
MOUNTAINS TO THE EAST, THEN SEEMED TO BREAK IN TWO OR SEPARATE. ONE
PART WENT SOUTHEAST, THE OTHER TO THE NORTHEAST."

AN ELECTRONIC ENGINEER -------- 21, SAID THE OBJECTS "SEEMED
TO BE TRAVELING AT SUPER-HUMAN SPEEDS, AND MAKING MANEUVERS NO
AIRCRAFT COULD WITHSTAND."

STATEMENTS FROM AN ARTICLE PRINTED IN THE ARPO BULLETIN BY FAMED
PSYCHOLOGIST DR. CARL JUNG OF SWITZERLAND MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO
"PSYCHIC DISTORTIONS."

JUNG SAID SATURDAY IN ZURICH THAT SOME AMERICAN NEWSPAPER HAD
QUOTED HIM AS SAYING FLYING SAUCERS WERE REAL.

IN THE ARTICLE, WHICH THE ARPO REPRINTED FROM A BRITISH JOURNAL,
JUNG WROTE THAT IN SOME CASES OF SIGHTINGS "I CAN ONLY SAY FOR CERTAIN
THESE THINGS ARE NO MERE RUMORS--SOMETHING HAS BEEN SEEN."

CONVINCED IT'S AUTHENTIC

Flying Saucer 4,000 Feet In Diameter
Photographed At New Mexico Air Base

Alamogordo, N.M. (UPI)- A photograph of a "unconventional aerial object" - saucer shaped and an estimated 4,000 feet across - was released yesterday by a group of civilians at the missile test center.

The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, which has government employees in its membership but has no official status, said a government photographer took the picture on Oct. 16, 1957. The weird, huge object hovered for 15 minutes over the north missile test range near Holloman Air Force Base, the APRO claimed.

L. G. Lorenzen of Alamogordo, spokesman for the APRO, said the name of the photographer could not be revealed. He said the Hatch Act forbids government employees from becoming involved in public controversies such as the decade-long debate about whether flying saucers exist.

Experts have examined the negative and all prints and are convinced of its authenticity, Lorenzen said. He quoted the photographer: "I've never seen anything like it before or since. It definitely was not a cloud."

March of this year, Lorenzen said, the APRO spokesman released the picture yesterday because the unofficial organization had inside information from an informant stationed which could be made.

Dr. Carl Jung, citing the world's leading psychiatrists this week accused the Air Force of withholding information about unidentified flying objects. The Swiss psychological said there was more than a possibility that "quasi-human beings" are at the controls of fantastically swift UFOs which are observing the earth, at the direction of "superior" beings.

Results Of 'Saucer' Hearings
Reportedly Kept Secret

WASHINGTON (UPI)—A group
which includes a former Central
Intelligence Agency official yes-
terday that congressional committees
have conducted super-secret hear-
ings on "flying saucers" but have
never made their findings public.

The group includes the Na-
tional Investigations Committee on
Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). It
insists the Air Force is withhold-
ing evidence which would prove
the existence of flying saucers.

Retired Vice Admiral R. H. Hil-
lenkoetter, who once headed the
Central Intelligence Agency, is a
committee member.

The NICAP quoted a letter from
Rep. William H. Ayres (R-Ohio)
stating that congressional profes-
sional hearings had been held. An
aide could not be reached for
comment.

The congressional investigations
have been held and are still being held
on the problem of unidentified fly-
ing objects (UFOs). Since most of
the material presented to the com-
mittees is classified, the hearings
are never printed, When conclu-
sions are reached, they will be re-
leased if possible.

Air Force claims that no con-
vincing evidence has been held.
The Air Force says that thor-
ough investigation has shown there
are no flying saucers. NICAP re-
ported flying saucers are man-
made or piloted. Officials contend
that mysterious objects in the sky
are natural phenomena, such as
lights or optical illusions.

The NICAP differs. Hillenkoetter
and other board members issued
a statement which said:

In possession, evidence in NICAP's
files is still withheld by the Air
Force. We believe the investiga-
tion on unidentified flying objects
is still continuing. We
believe this policy to be dan-
gerous. It makes it possible for the
Soviet government to claim domin-
ion of UFOs or flying saucers.

Such a claim, especially at this
time, might create a serious situa-
tion in this country.

The group includes Rear Adm. E. Kehoe who has written ex-
tensively on flying saucers, quoted
Rep. Ralph H. Scott (D-N.C.) in
support of the demand for more
information.

Scott said: "The general public
should be allowed information thus
far known about flying objects ex-
cept, of course, in the case where
they might be a source of panic
or panicked by such a revelation."

If this information could be in a
presentable form, the American people
would be in a better position to rea-
son and not to emotion, I think.

Flying Objects Real, Psychiatrist Insists

ALAMOGORDO, N. M., July 23 (UPl)—Dr. Carl Jung, the father of analytical psychology, said today that so-called unidentified flying objects "are not mere rumor" and the U. S. Air Force was "creating panic" by withholding information about them.

Jung's statement appears in the monthly bulletin of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, UFO filter center. Jung serves as chief psychologist for the center.

"In the course of years," Jung wrote, "I gathered a considerable mass of observations." Jung wrote. "However, I can only say for certain these things are not mere rumor. Something has been seen."

A purely psychological explanation is ruled out by the fact that a large number of observations have proven unexplainable as natural phenomena. The United States and Canada consider the observations to be real and have set up bureaus to compile reports.

"The discs, reports indicate, do not behave in accordance with physical laws but as though without weight and they show signs of intelligent guidance." By quasi-human qualities are such that no normal human could survive.

Construction of the machines proves a scientific technique prior to ours and admits no two opinions, Jung's report said.

The Swiss scientist continued to work with the research group when the organization wrote him in 1947 to investigate the psychological factors involved in UFO sightings, and that because of his interest, it would like to make him an honorary member.

Jung's report continued, "Is that the American Air Force, despite all the information at its possession, and its so-called fear of creating panic seems to work systematically to do that very thing?"

Jung, who has not yet published an authentic and certain account of the situation, is following information to be charged out of it by Journalists.

(U-NA)
ALAMOGORDO, N.M., JULY 30.--(UP)--A PHOTOGRAPH OF AN "UNCONVENTIONAL AERIAL OBJECT" SHAPED SIZED AND AN ESTIMATED 4,000 (CORRECT) FEET ACROSS WAS RELEASED TODAY BY A GROUP OF CIVILIANS ASSOCIATED WITH A MISSILE TEST CENTER.

THE AERIAL PHENOMENA RESEARCH ORGANIZATION (APRO), WHICH HAS GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES IN ITS MEMBERSHIP BUT HAS NO OFFICIAL STATUS, SAID A GOVERNMENT PHOTOGRAPHER TOOK THE PICTURE ON OCT. 16, 1957, THE AERIAL HUGE OBJECT HOVERED FOR 15 MINUTES OVER THE NORTH MISSILE TEST RANGE NEAR HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE. THE APRO CLAIMED.

J. G. LORENZN OF ALAMOGORDO, SPOKESMAN FOR THE APRO, SAID THE NAME OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER COULD NOT BE REVEALED. HE SAID THE HATCH ACT FORBIDS GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES FROM BECOMING INVOLVED IN PUBLIC CONTROVERSIES SUCH AS THE DECADE-LONG DEBATE ABOUT FLYING SAUCERS.

"EXPERTS HAVE EXAMINED THE NEGATIVE AND ALL PRINTS AND ARE CONVINCED OF ITS AUTHENTICITY," LORENZN SAID. "G CONVINCED OF ITS AUTHENTICITY," LORENZN SAID. "C CONVINCED OF ITS AUTHENTICITY," LORENZN SAID. HE QUOTED THE PHOTOGRAPHER: "I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE OR SINCE. IT DEFINITELY WAS NOT A CLOUD."

LORENZN SAID APRO MEMBERS CALCULATED THAT THE "UNCONVENTIONAL AERIAL OBJECT" WAS 4,900 FEET ACROSS ITS LONGEST AXIS BY COMPUTING ANGLES TAKEN FROM KNOWN POLES, MOUNTAINS AND SUCH--HIGH APPEAR.

IN THE PHOTOGRAPH, HE ADMITTED IT WAS ONLY AN EDUCATED GUESS, SINCE THE ALTITUDE OF THE SAUCER WAS NOT KNOWN.

THE PHOTOGRAPHER DID NOT DISCLOSE THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE PICTURE UNTIL MARCH OF THIS YEAR, LORENZN SAID. THE APRO SPOKESMAN SAID THE PICTURE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO SEVERAL UNOFFICIAL ORGANIZATION HEADS WHO ADDED ALL THE USE OF IT FROM AN INFORMATION STANDPOINT WHICH COULD BE MADE.

DR. CARL JUNG, AMONG THE WORLD'S LEADING PSYCHIATRISTS THIS WEEK ACCUSED THE SWISS FLYING OBJECTS FORCE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. THE SWISS PSYCHOLOGIST SAID THERE WAS MORE THAN A POSSIBILITY THAT QUASI-HUMAN BEINGS ARE AT THE CONTROLS OF FANTASTICALLY STIFF UFOS WHICH ARE OBSERVING THE EARTH, AT THE DIRECTION OF

ROUGH DRAFT - to protect my secretary's eyes fr- -oing had due to bad handling,

ments given publicity by the press, this Center recommends
so discretion be given to include the following, in this report:

a. Rebuttal to the widely publicized "Space Man" over
New Mexico Photo: This photo was taken by a major
U.S. newspapers, in well-known publications such as NEWSWEEK
and TIME, as well as some coverage by LIFE, is given
greater significance by its purported connection with Dr. Carl
Jung, the world's foremost psychologist, who is allegedly a
"space believer". Although later developed, has indicated
otherwise, he have the original negative. Our examination
and analysis indicates the object is a cloud. USAF Research and
Development, who also examined it individually, and without
our knowledge, concurs. This office is following for
possible use as an explanation to the public:

(1) The Sun's slant rays near dawn or dusk may
often impress themselves upon small detached
cumulus clouds having flat bases and shallow,
rounded domes or cylindrical shapes. The
phenomenon can create a more effective illusion
particularly when a type of cumulus cloud, a
lenticular alto-cumulus, is involved. This
cloud form, whether seen with the naked eye
or photographed, has the well-defined shape
and appearance of the typical so-called "flying
saucer".

(2) These detached cloud forms having "saucer" or
"space ship" configurations are often photographed.
When these photographs are placed to locate or
distance and size they will invariably show the
object to be huge in size. For example, in a
recent case the object was computed to be over
one-quarter of a mile in size, floating slowly
over a fairly large-size city and adjacent to
an airway having considerable aircraft. One of
the largest airplanes in the world is an Iaa-66
whose length is less than 170 feet and certainly
would be noticed by any number of people if it
passed over any populated areas. Yet, often
the sources submitting such photographs refuse
to accept the logic that it is odd that any
craft 10 to 20 times larger than one of the
largest aircraft in the world can pass over a
city in broad daylight and in an area where
(unknown to the reporter) there were a number of
military and civil aircraft, covered 24 hours
a day by radar and other units, and no report
of anything strange or unusual reported or
observed by these or others in the area.

FRONT PAGE OF THE WEEK

A NUCLEAR BLAST
LIGHTS UP THE PACIFIC
The United States launched a missile
with a nuclear warhead from Johnston
Island in the Pacific August 1. The warhead was detonated somewhere high
over the ocean.

It was the first high-altitude nuclear
explosion--and the first firing of a groundto-air missile with nuclear warhead--to
be publicly announced by the United
States. But the blast was so mighty that
it was "public" even before the announcement.

At Honolulu, 700 miles away, residents
were dazzled by "a ball of fire with a
definite mushroom effect." Police-station
telephone lines were jammed with inquiring calls. The flash was visible from
Hawaii Island, 200 miles southwest of
Honolulu, to Kauai Island, 100 miles
northwest.

The test at Johnston Island had
been described as involving "short-range
defensive missiles"--a definition that
would fit the Redstone, the Nike-Hercules, the Talos, or experimental anti-missile missiles.

The August 1 test apparently was part
of the U.S. research program aimed at
developing a missile that can track down
and destroy the intercontinental ballistic
missiles of an enemy. Reportedly, the
missile-firing was accompanied by firing
of instruments to measure explosive effects at
an altitude of 100 miles or more.

Before the firing, ships were warned to
stay clear of a circle, 520 miles in radius
around Johnston Island. No contract, earlier tests have produced a danger area
of only about 75 miles.

STEEL AND ALUMINUM:
PRICES GO UP AGAIN
Another upward turn in the wage-price
spiral was threatened last week when
steel companies and aluminum producers
announced price increases.

Steel companies announced price
boosts averaging $4.25 to $4.50 a ton for
flat-rolled steel--used chiefly by auto
producers and appliance makers. It takes
about $3,800 worth of steel to make a
large refrigerator.

Aluminum prices for things like building-girders for construction, drill pipe
for oil rigs, tin plate for food containers
--has not been raised. But there is concern that these prices may follow the
others upward.

Prices of autos and appliances may not
be immediately affected by the steel
price increase. But, according to manufacturers, higher prices are "just a matter of time."

Aluminum uses face a price rise of
seven-tenths of a cent per pound, an-

nounced by aluminum companies last
week. Even with the increased price, pig
aluminum will be cheaper than it was last
March, before the industry cut prices by
2 cents a pound. Large quantities of
aluminum are used in refrigerators.
Both steel and aluminum companies
attributed the new price increases to recent wage boosts. On July 1, steelworkers got wage raises and fringe benefits
estimated by companies to total 20 cents
an hour. Aluminum workers received a
similar increase August 1.

AN INVASION PLOT
THAT MISFIRED
An expeditionary force consisting of
four Americans and three exiled Haitian
Army officers landed on the coast of Haiti
on the night of Oct. 6, 1957, challenging
the Government of President Francois
Duvalier. They seized a truck, drove to
the capital, Port-au-Prince, and launched
a surprise attack.

Loyal troops soon rallied and fought
back. Killing all seven invaders, The review of the plot was over. By Oct. 8, it
was over. President Duvalier was voted
dictatorial powers, and demonstrators
gathered at the American Embassy to
protest the U. S. policy of granting asylum
to Haitian exiles.

FLYING SAUCERS: FACT OR FANCY?
The idea that people who see flying saucers are "seeing
things" now is attacked by a famous psychologist.
Dr. Carl Jung, 83, says he has been studying reports
of "unidentified flying objects" since 1944. His conclusions:
These things are not mere rumor. Something has been
seen. A pure psychological explanation is ruled out.

Dr. Jung's analysis was published by the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO). A typical example, a photo from Alamogordo, N. Mex. Photo below, released by APRO
shows an "unconventional aerial object" which hovered over a U.S. missile range Oct. 16, 1957.

1. The color transparency contained in this report has been examined and it is the conclusion of all personnel that it is an actual photo of clouds, as you have stated. The transparency appears to have no false photo qualities.

2. It is suggested that the transparency be turned over to the Photo Lab, AFCIN-MD, with the request that an enlargement with the greatest magnification possible be made. With this type of an enlargement, the transparency edges of the object should prove it to be a cloud formation.

Microscopic examination of the original transparency shows no interruption in the grain. Processing prints of progressively harder contrast gradually obliterates the clouds in the upper portion of the picture as well as the trail to the left of the object, but the body of the object remains firm in outline. At this point, contour lines begin to appear which indicate the object is not saucer-shaped but rather of tubular configuration.

In our investigation, no single clue was uncovered which could identify this object as anything conventional. Therefore, in our files it is listed as a UAO --- Unconventional Aerial Object.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Alamogordo, New Mexico. The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization today released a Kodachrome of a UFO (flying saucer) to the Public Information Office at Holloman Air Force Base. The color transparency shows an unknown object hovering over the Holloman test range approximately seven miles northwest of Tularosa, New Mexico. Included with the picture was a report giving complete attribution and analysis.

"We would like to call it a lenticular cloud", said L. J. Lorenzen, Public Relations Director of A.P.R.O., "but lenticulars simply do not form over warm desert country at low altitude ---- besides, the whirlpool air currents necessary for this type of formation would not permit the misty trails soon floating off to the left of the object." He further explained, "It was stationary when photographed and was observed in the same position for fifteen minutes."

A.P.R.O. C., with headquarters in Alamogordo, is a world-wide non-profit organization dedicated to the study of the UFO problem.
