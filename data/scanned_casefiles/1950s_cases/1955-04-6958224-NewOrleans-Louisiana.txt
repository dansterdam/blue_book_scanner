1. In the opinion of the Investigating Officer, this sighting was caused by an UAF (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon).

Flight Service Center, Maxwell AFB, revealed no weather balloon information.

Only one observer reported the sighting.

Have been unable to find any additional information concerning this sighting.

Duration of sighting calls have been less than positive identification.
