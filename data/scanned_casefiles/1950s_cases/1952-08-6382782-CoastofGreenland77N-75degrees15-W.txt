1.- In accordance with reference (a) the following information is submitted for transmission to the U.S. Air Force. The information given below is in the order prescribed in paragraph 7.c. of reference (b):

(a) Objects either spherical or disk like in shape; from slightly smaller than the cosmic balloon to half its size; white in color; three in number; in a triangular formation no observed aerodynamic features, trail or exhaust, or propulsion system; speed varied from zero to a rapid acceleration to a speed in excess of the speed of sound; maintained formation throughout observation; disappeared by reason of high speed and distance.

(b) Sighted at 1550z for a period of two to three minutes.

(c) Visual observation from a PBM-2 aircraft flying at 10,000 feet at a speed of 150 knots.

(d) Sighted at latitude 77-40N, longitude 75-15 W.

(e) Both officers are PPIP's and are Naval Academy graduates in 1949. LTJG O'FLAHERTY has 506 hours flight time and LTJG MOORE has 731 hours. Both officers are considered highly reliable and have no tendencies toward the spectacular.

(f) Undercast to 8500 feet with clear weather and unlimited visibility above 8500 feet. Winds were from the southeast at approximately 25 knots.

(c) No known conditions which might account for the sighting.

(h) No physical evidence.

(i) Icebreaker called either during observation or shortly thereafter and it was determined that only one object was intentionally released from the balloon.

(j) There was no known air traffic in the general area at the time of the sighting.

On 29 August 1952, while on a cosmic balloon tracking flight, I observed the balloon at about 74,000 feet at about 155%. I was sitting in the pilot's seat on the port side of the cabin and was circling slightly to left on a heading of approximately 0400 when the balloon released the parachute containing the instruments. The balloon at this time was to the north and slightly west of my location. Its altitude at this point of release was about 74,000 feet and I was flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet.

The weather was clear and visibility unlimited above 8,000 feet below which there was an undercast. I was flying a PBY-2 at a speed of about 150 knots. To my knowledge there was no other air traffic in the general area.

Immediately upon observing the release of the instrument parachute I further observed three objects slightly smaller than the balloon, shaped like round disks with white in color. My first impression was that they were other balloons released by the larger balloon. However, this impression vanished when I realized they were in a triangular formation, equally spaced to the right of, and forming a diamond shaped pattern with, the main balloon. I observed these objects for some two to three minutes and LIKE MORE, looking through them as astro-domes, observed these objects at the same time and we discussed them over the ICS while observing them. LT CALLHART was in the co-pilot's seat and because of the relative position of the balloon and the fact that we were in a half standard rate turn I lost sightings when they came directly between me and the sun. Upon sighting the balloon the three objects had disappeared. We called the Icebreaker upon sighting the objects and while they were still within view and asked how many objects were to have been released. They replied that only one had been. The objects did not reappear and showed no means of propulsion.

On 29 August 1952, at about 1550½, while on cosmic balloon tracking flight as navigator I observed the following: Three white objects shaped like spheres, about ½ the size of the balloon and in a triangular shaped formation. I observed them through the astro-dome at an altitude of 10,000 feet with an 8500 foot undercast and clear and visibility unlimited above that. We were in a PBY-2 aircraft flying in a northerly direction at about 150 knots. Winds were from the southeast at about 25 knots. The balloon was to the north of us at about 7,000 feet when I saw it release the instrument parachute and immediately there appeared the three objects. They remained stationary relative to the balloon for about 2 minutes and then moved rapidly off and disappeared in about 5 seconds. Because of this I would estimate their speed at considerably in excess of the speed of sound. They showed no trail or exhaust nor means of propulsion. During the observation I was in communication over the IC system with LT.JG O'FLAHERTY and he lost the sighting in the sun.
