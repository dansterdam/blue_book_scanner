1. At approximately 1914h, 27 January 1953, Capt. [redacted] of the 363rd Bomb Squadron, 43rd Bomb Wing, Medium, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and his wife were observing a flying object traveling in a general northwesterly direction. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and appeared to trail a smoke-like exhaust. (See diagram). The object appeared circular in color and larger than the largest star in the sky. There was no discernible propulsion noise. While traveling through about 30 degrees of arc, the object disappeared in about one minute after traveling from view due to great distance.

2. Significance - Unknown.

1. The object observed by S/Sgt [redacted] and his wife was round, brilliant
white in color and trailed a what seemed to be luminous rocket-type exhaust gases.
The object was traveling at one altitude (unestimated by the observer) and
appeared to be traveling four to five times faster than a modern jet aircraft.
There were no propulsion or exhaust noises and the object seemed to
disappear due to distance after about one minute of observation.

The luminous trail of the object appeared to vary in length. The color of
the exhaust from the object to about three times the length of the object in
trail, appeared reddish white and gold. (See diagram). From point (1) in
diagram to point #2, the exhaust appeared to thin out assume a flame colored
thin and was a short interval much like rocket exhaust. (See diagram).
There were no apparent flight control surfaces or silhouette and the object
accompanied no maneuvers other than straight line travel from Northeast to
Southeast.
