UNCLASSIFIED

Source, a FAB major who has been close to FAB's investigation of flying saucer sightings, stated that he has for a long time believed in the existence of the reported sightings. During a recent investigation, he spent several hours in a good control tower and witnessed a sight which he considers to be highly intelligent, highly observant, and quite normal. 

The personnel on duty were surprised to see a light appear at a low altitude around prior to take-off and ground observers stated they passed near it when arriving from about halfway in cloud formations.
He stated this was not the first time they had seen such objects, and this particular sighting occurred at Gravital Air Base (Porto Alegre) several days later when 150 FAB personnel were present. The usual reports of erratic maneuvers were made.

During this latter sighting, he placed a group of FAB airmen on one side of a building's foundation to observe...

FAB records show sightings as far back as the early 1800's, which by their descriptions resembled a landing by one of these objects. He described it as being about 50 feet in diameter, or slightly less, and which was retracted for high speed travel.

FAB personnel have reported numerous sightings by Brazilian airline pilots, some of whom claim to have been very close to these objects. These reports confirm the Cruzeiro do Sul farmer's description as to size and construction.

It is hoped that further reports on this subject can be obtained in the interior of Brazil. It is reportedly flying down to take a closer look at the cities and ignite as bright officers. FAB officers are satisfied that the object again took off and disappeared as the usual high rate of speed.

UNCLASSIFIED

Source, as well as the PAS officer in charge of flying saucer "investigations", is convinced that sightings reported by reliable observers are thoroughly credible. He is also convinced that there have been a number of actual flying saucer type objects seen above. What neither he nor PAS official investigators know is to what to do with this information.

Source also stated that PAS has on file various photographs of these objects. An effort will be made to obtain examples for forwarding.

COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:
This reporter has maintained a skeptical attitude toward "flying saucers". Up to this point I have felt that the interest and study being given to reported sightings in Brazil are from unqualified observers and crackpots. And there are therefore completely unreliable. There is an underlying bias of sound reports from qualified observers which makes it difficult to doubt the existence of these objects. This reporter is no longer certain. But an evaluation of what they are and where they come from is beyond his capabilities.

NOV. 26, 1954 PARDO RIVER NEAR PONTAL, BRAZIL (LORENZEN P. 46) WITNESSES: 00. HIS SHAPE TALLER, SILVER SHINY METAL, VERY SMOOTH, WITH NO VISIBLE PORTHOLES OR MOTORS, SUDDENLY ALVES SPOTTED A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY, APPARENTLY HEADING TOWARDS HIM. HE WATCHED IT LAND ABOUT 1500 METERS FROM WHERE HE WAS STANDING. IT WAS SO NEAR HE COULD HAVE TOUCHED IT. HE SAID THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED INTO INLAND - IT WAS HUGE. AFTER IT LANDED, FOUR OR FIVE MEN, DRESSED IN TIGHT FITTING WHITE CLOTHING WITH CLOSE-FITTING SKULL CAPS, EMERGED FROM A WINDOW-LIKE OPENING ON THE SIDE OF THE CRAFT. THEY STOOD TERROR-STRICKEN, WATCHING THE SMALL CREATURES COLLECT SAMPLES OF GRASS, HERBS AND LEAVES. ONE OF THEM FILLED A SMALL METAL TUBE WITH RIVER WATER. WHEN THEY SUDDENLY AS THEY HAD COME, THE SMALL FIGURES JUMPED BACK INTO THE CRAFT AND THEIR MACHINE WHICH TOOK OFF VERTICALLY AS SWIFTLY AND AS SILENTLY AS IT HAD APPEARED.
