ATIC 212753                                  UNCLASSIFIED

Source, a FAB major who has been close to FAB's investigation of flying saucer sightings, stated that he has for a long time believed in the existence of these objects. (He is reputed to have 7,000 flying hours and is considered by the reported to be highly intelligent, keenly observant, and quite normal.)

He personally pursued one in a Gloustar Meteor last fall in Porto Alegre (he did not find it after he became airborne, although he had seen it from the ground prior to takeoff and ground observers stated he passed near it when driving from 45,000' through a hole in a cloud formation). He also was in charge at Gravat Air Base (Porto Alegre) several days later when 150 FAB personnel were reported to have seen two of these objects.

During this latter sighting, he placed a group of FAB airmen on one side of a hangar, another group on the opposite side, out of each others' sight and hearing. He then travelled between the two groups, asking them what they saw. All reports were similar. He then placed observers in a triangular arrangement around the field, about a mile on each side of the triangle. These observers wrote down what they had seen, as it occurred, and their reports jived. All observers reported an object hovering at estimated altitudes varying from 30,000 to 45,000 feet. After remaining fairly stationary in one spot (although appearing to be undulating), it suddenly sped across approximately 60Â° of arc and resumed its hovering in that location. When it again sped across a similar arc, the major clocked it by chronograph at a precise rate of 8,000 mph (assuming an altitude of 45,000). The object was then joined by a similar one, they hovered a few minutes, then disappeared at a great rate of speed.

Source reported that the object appeared to be surrounded by a white glow increased in size when it moved (i.e. this halo-like ring was small when hovering, larger when traveling).

Source stated that FAB records show sightings as far back as the early 1800's. One, written by a farmer in Mato Grosso in 1876, describes a landing by one of these objects. He described it as being about 90 feet in diameter, of metal construction, and containing a turret that rose out of the top of the disk and which was retracted for high speed travel.

FAB records are also reported to contain numerous sightings by Brazilian airline pilots, some of whom claim to have been very close to these objects (within several hundred feet in some cases). These reports confirm the Mato Grosso farmer's description, as to size and construction.

Two FAB lieutenants were reported to have sighted one, on the ground in the interior of Brazil. They reportedly flew down to take a look at it, whereupon it took off, crossed a river and landed again. The two officers are said to have continued their approach but the object again took off and disappeared at the usual high rate of speed.

Source, as well as the FAB officer in charge of flying saucer "investigations", is convinced that sightings reported by reliable observers are thoroughly credible. He is also certain that there have been sufficient sightings over a sufficient period of time to constitute the description of the object given above. What neither he nor FAB official investigators know is what to do with the information. As this writing it is merely being read and filed. Evaluation of the information is not possible both because of the relative rareness of it and because it is not within the capabilities of FAB technicians.

Source also stated that FAB has on file various photographs of these objects. An effort will be made to obtain examples for forwarding.

COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:

This reporter has maintained a skeptical attitude toward "flying saucers" up to this time. Despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of the reported sightings in Brazil are from unqualified observers and crackpots and are therefore completely unreliable, there is an underlying base of sound reports from qualified observers which makes it difficult to doubt the existence of these objects. This reporter is no longer skeptical. But an evaluation of what they are and where they come from is beyond his capabilities.
