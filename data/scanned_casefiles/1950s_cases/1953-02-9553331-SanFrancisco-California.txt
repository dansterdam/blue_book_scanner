Here is the text I can read from the document:

warm layer of cold air and then another of cold air forming the base of the "high pressure area" of the Weather Bureau.

Added a Weather Bureau note: "A high pressure area might weaken enough to allow a little fog—then you wouldn't have your inversion areas any more."

And you wouldn't have any "Binky," either, he suggested. "While the show lasted"

SUMMARY:
In accordance with AFR 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: "Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLOSRPT)", the following report of an unidentified flying object is submitted.

On 13 February 1953, between 1758 and 1820, PST four observers manning a GOC Post on top of Mount Sutro in San Francisco, California sighted an unidentified flying object. This object was sighted over the ocean at an altitude estimated at 10,000 feet. The object was described as round with what appeared to be two-vapor-trails following it. The speed of this object was not estimated but is appeared consistently slower than that of an aircraft. No sound was heard from this object except during the period when it passed over the GOC Post. The object disappeared to move up-and down and had a zig zag course. Object disappeared over the city of San Francisco.

Enclosed herewith is a copy of the story pertaining to these objects as printed by the San Francisco Examiner dated 14 February 1953. According to the Examiner thousands of persons in the Bay area observed the same or similar objects to the one described in this report during the early morning hours and early evening of 13 February 1953.

An unidentified flying object was observed by four members of a GOC Post located on top of Mt. Sutro in San Francisco, California during the evening of 13 February 1953.

1. Description of object. One, round, black object which appeared to have two slim, straight following (possibly vapor trails). Object appeared to be gaining and losing considerable altitude and flying a zig zag course. No means of propulsion were observed. A throbbing sound was heard apparently coming from the object as it passed overhead the GOC Post where the observers were located. The unidentified flying object disappeared from view over the city of San Francisco. Object was first observed approximately four miles to the West and over the ocean. Speed of this unidentified object appeared to be slower than that of a conventional aircraft.

2. Time of sighting was between 1758 and 1820 PST, 13 February 1953.

3. Manner of observation was visual without aids. No radar contacts with this object were reported.

4. Location of Observers during sighting was on top of Mount Sutro, San Francisco, California. The unidentified flying object was estimated by the observers as being approximately 10,000 feet altitude.

5. The observers of this object were: [names redacted], San Francisco, Calif; [names redacted], San Bernardito, Calif; [names redacted], San Francisco, Calif.

6. The weather was clear with a few scattered clouds. Visibility was reported as unlimited.

7. According to a newspaper article concerning similar sightings of unidentified flying objects which appeared in the San Francisco Examiner dated 14 February 1953, Dr. Otto Struve, a member of the University of California Astronomy Department explained the numerous sightings of "flying saucers" on 13 February 1953 as being caused by a temperature inversion.

Miscellaneous:

Flying Saucers. Stories of these mysterious vehicles are legion; only rarely, however, is such a report coupled with the name of a manufacturer. Particular interest is, therefore, attached to the following two announcements. In the first case, Radio Belgrade stated that a number of flying saucers flew over a Belgrade suburb on February 15th. They were, it appears, developed by the research department of the Yugoslav Air Force and had the following characteristics: diameter, flying all-up weight 1 1/2 lbs; to top speed, 31 mph with radio control. A further display is scheduled for March 15th.

NORTH ATLANTIC
The second officer of the American SS. The Cabins Capt. E. F. Nattey, Master, reports that at 0715 G. M. T., February 15, 1953, in lat. 26°53' N., lon. 71°55' W. he sighted a grayish colored object about the size of a star of first magnitude brilliance. It was first sighted bearing 225° altitude 10° and after the sky parallel to the horizon in a northerly direction for about 75° of azimuth in about 2 seconds and disappeared into a cloud.

Weather clear with few clouds, wind SW. force 3, very good visibility, barometer 30.03 inches, air temperature 71° F.

Second Officer D. B. Hoobier of the American SS. Quirigua, Capt. George Yepremian, Master, reports that at 0715 G. M. T., February 15, 1953, in approximate position lat. 26°12' N., lon. 71°41' W. he observed a bright reddish-orange meteor-like object appeared near the star Antares bearing 135° altitude 125° travelled in a straight line of about 200° and passed almost directly over the vessel at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet until it disappeared in wind clouds on the horizon in the west. It was visible for about 10 seconds and left a very bright reddish trail.

Weather clear with scattered clouds on the horizon, wind south-southwest force 4, moderate sea, air temperature 74° F.

Blinky, the Amber
Bulb, Flits in Sky;
Thousands See It

But It's Only
Hot Air

Here is the OCR text from the document:

By WILL STEVENS
"Blinky" returned to the skies over the San Francisco Bay area last night, flipping and looping and swishing like something possessed.
Thousands on both sides of the Bay saw The Thing which wasn't a Flying Saucer from Venus or Mars ... folks hoped it wasn't a fireball. Scientists naturally don't hover, and "Blinky" moved ... like this ... always up and down ... and at such a speed ... like that, etc.

Not a Jet, Either...
Nor was it jet aircraft. Their trails playing weird tricks. Neither the Air Force nor the Navy had any jets aloft. It wasn't a flare. The Navy and Air Force weren't dropping anything last night, and the Coast Guard wasn't firing any flares either. Nor was the Army—or the Marines.

It wasn't a Weather Bureau balloon. The bureau didn't launch its nightly radio balloon until 7:30 p. m. from Oakland ... and then promptly explored one south, toward San Jose—out of the "Blinky" area of operation—and up to 50,000 feet.

Gauges Colors...
What thousands saw was a round "halo"—an amber colored, changing at times to a reddish tint—hovered at from 5,000 to 10,000 feet. Between 5:30 a. m. and 6 a. m. earlier Friday, others saw the same object. Last "Blinky" came back.

Scientists and Weather forecasters agreed, however, that nature probably was doing it with mirrors—or more specifically, that a "mirroring temperature inversion" layer is the atmospheric was refracting lights to produce the weird effect.

LIKE DOUBLE FEATURE

Actually, the sky show approximated a double feature. As early as 3:30 a.m. yesterday, "Blinky"—before the scientists got way into excitement—popped at street level.

For two hours and eighteen minutes, his erratic behavior—the traditional "flying saucer" pattern—was tracked by possible watchers. Wayne and Aldo Berta, driving in separate cars in different sections in Emeryville, sighted it first.

"I wouldn't guess the altitude. It appeared to be hovering over Albany race track, and seemed to be weaving from side to side. At first it was simply colored. Then it turned to silver."

"It moved up and down at intervals. It moved to the north, round like a bulb. Then it moved south."

SEEN BY OTHERS

Officer Berta gave almost precise description. Berkeley Police Patrolman Robert Coleman saw it at 3 a.m. California Highway Patrolman Al Turner and

Policeman Roy sighted it, "hovering over the Bay, approximately halfway between Hunter's Point and Alameda. It stayed there for about a minute, then disappeared in a southerly direction."

NOT A SPACE SHIP

Still the scientist, Doctor Grove observed, last night—after suggesting the "inversion" theory:

"We're sure these 'saucers' people see are not space ships from outer space."

It is impossible, he said, to have intelligent human beings in any of the planets of the solar system except earth.

"Speculating very broadly," he added, "there is a possibility that intelligent humans beings are on other planets—other solar systems—but if they are, they are at least a million light years away."

One thing nobody saw: little green men.

Thousands See 'Bulb'
Whirl Over Bay Area
(Continued from Page One)

though. It was first class,
against the vast panorama of
the sky itself. Hundreds of
telephone calls from both sides of
the Bay, the peninsula, and Ma-
rin County turned The Exam-
iner switchboard into a minia-
ture celestial display of lights
unto itself.

VIEW FROM GATE BRIDGE
What thousands saw was
characterized briefly by Golden
Gate Bridge Toll Collector Fred
Peterson, of 149 Irving Street.
He said:

"I saw it first at 5:53 p. m.
and for five minutes there-
after, it would while lights made big, slow circles in the
sky just above China Beach.
It wasn't so high, but high-
er than the bridge towers. A
number of motorists saw it
as they drove up the approach
from San Francisco. It was
amber colored, changing to
silver at times."

Civil Defense Ground Ob-
servers Rudy Pugh, Ray Roge-
way and Roy Homer, were pre-
cisely what they saw, too.

Among the thousands watch-
ing the skies, scientists at Lick
Observatory didn't see anything.
they couldn't train their glass
downward. And "Blinky" was
giving around a 3,000 feet. Ob-
servers at Morrison Planetarium

EXPLAINED—A
mass of warm air, developing
between two layers of cold air,
acts as a reflector of light,
Astronomer Otto Struve said,
explaining the gloss over the
bay area. His theory was supported by reports from the
Weather Bureau.

Lee Wood — Patrol car at
University Avenue and East-
shore Highway, spotted
"Blinky."

Turner declared:

"It was a white ball of light
or fire, approximately 3,000
feet high. It was traveling in
a westerly direction, at about
250 to 300 mph, from over
the Richmond hills. It passed
directly over the Golden Gate
Bridge. There were no trails.
It gave the appearance of being a very bright electric light
bulb. In midair."

Wood added:

"It was too slow for a falling star or meteor."

SPOTTED FROM BRIDGE
At 5:20 a. m. Highway Patrolman James Morgan, on the
Golden Gate Bridge, picked it
up through binoculars. Said
Morgan:

"I first saw it over Alcatraz,
traveling west. It appeared to
be 3,000 feet high, judging by
the height of the 700 foot
bridge towers. There was no
noise. It was perfectly round
in shape, and of bright but
not brilliant white color. I
watched it for two minutes,
and saw it disappear past the
Farallon Islands."

At that stage, it was seen and
similarly described by lookouts
at the Mount Tamalpais Ranger
Station.

At 6:18 a. m. yesterday,
