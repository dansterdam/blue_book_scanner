AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT UNCLASSIFIED
FROM: Dir. of Intel., 25 AD
Hamilton AFB, California

An unidentified flying object was observed by four members of a GGC Post located on top of Mt. Sutro in San Francisco, California during the evening of 13 February 1953.

The description of object (one ground visual appearance) which appeared to have metallic characteristics and be larger than a conventional aircraft. No means of propulsion were observed. A throbbing sound was heard apparently coming from the object as it passed overhead where the observers were located. The unidentified flying object disappeared from view over the western horizon. The object was estimated to be moving at a speed estimated to be slower than that of a conventional aircraft.

Time of sighting was between 1755 and 1820 PST, 13 February 1953. No other observations with this object were reported.

Location of observers during sighting was on top of Mount Sutro, San Francisco, California. The unidentified object was estimated by the observers to be approximately 10,000 feet altitude.

The observers of this object were: San Francisco, Calif., San Bernardino, Calif.

The weather was clear with a few scattered clouds. Visibility was reported as unlimited.

According to a newspaper article concerning similar sightings of unidentified flying objects which appeared in the San Francisco Examiner dated 16 February 1953, members of the University of California Astronomy Department stated that the sightings could have been caused by a temperature inversion on 13 February 1953.

IS Fedearna 7 1953
Belgrade, Yugoslavia

Flying Saucers. Stories of these mysterious vehicles are legion; only rarely, however, are phenomena of this type observed with as much reliability and authenticity. Yesterday, in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, occurred another incident of this sort.
In the first case, radio belinne received on February 15th a communication from the research department of the Yugoslav Air Force stating that a formation of flying saucers had flown over a Belgrade suburb on February 15th. They were, it appears, developed by the research department of the Yugoslav Air Force and they had the following characteristics: diameter, 15 meters; speed, 1000 kilometers per hour; altitude, 3000 meters; equipped with radio control. A further display is "scheduled for Marshal Tito's birthday".

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text describing a UFO sighting report. The text appears to be from a project Blue Book document dated 15 Feb 1953, describing a sighting by the second officer of the American SS Outrider near the Azores bearing 180 degrees at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The object was visible for about 10 seconds before disappearing into a cloud.

The text in the document is as follows:

NO CASE (Information Only)
NORTH ATLANTIC
15 FEB 1953

The second officer of the American SS, The Cabook, Capt. E.P. Rathjen, reports that on 2/15/53 at 1750 GCT, he sighted a bright colored object about 20,000 feet high, bearing 180 degrees, which appeared to have a metallic surface. It traveled parallel to the horizon in a northerly direction for about 75 miles. The object disappeared into a cloud. Weather clear with few clouds, wind SW, force 3, very good visibility. Barometer 30.05 inches, air temperature 71 F.

Second Officer D. H. Hoobler of the American SS. Ouruing, Capt. George Pepghman, Master, reports that at 0715 Z, 2/15/53, he observed a long-shaped bright colored object at approximately 20,000 feet altitude bearing 135 degrees distance 10 miles. It appeared like a straight line of about 30 feet and passed almost overhead. After it was observed for a few seconds it disappeared in a cloud. The weather was clear with few clouds. Wind southeast force 3, moderate sea, air temperature 74 F.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

By WILL STEVENS 
BERKELEY, Feb. 9.--A San Francisco attorney said today he and a companion saw a formation of objects over the San Francisco Bay area at dusk yesterday, shining and flippinq and swinging in an "incredible performance." 
The man. who asked that his name be withheld, said the six or seven objects were about the size of a baseball and seemed to be at an altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. He said they were spotted over the bay near Treasure Island and Berkeley at 5:45 p.m. yesterday. 
"We watched them for about 15 minutes," the attorney said. "They were going at a terrific rate of speed, just flashing along. Then they would suddenly reverse direction and go the other way. 
"Two of them came very close together and then split off in different directions. It was an incredible performance, like nothing I've ever seen before." 
The man said fireballs don't have the performance capabilities of these objects. "I'd hate to think of them as missiles or anything of that sort," he added. 
"Not a jet, Either" 
"They were not jet aircraft, either," he said, "because my friend and I are both familiar with jet performance and these things were moving much faster." 
The man said he could not identify the objects, but he is convinced they were not conventional aircraft. 
"We watched the weather bureau broadcast this morning," he said, "and they had nothing to report about any unusual weather phenomena that would account for what we saw." 
The Weather Bureau said no special weather conditions were reported for that period over the Oakland area. 
"Whatever it was, it was high up - some 5,000 to 10,000 feet - and it was very, very fast," the man said. "It just didn't seem like anything we had ever seen before."

OCR Output:
Actually, the sky show appeared to be a double feature, as the object seemed to be as large as a house, "winky" before the scientist's eyes and then disappeared. This phenomenon--caused eyes to pop at once--was witnessed by a number of people here.
Some "professional" flying saucers flyers recently have been chasing meteors in the skies, claiming they are from outer space. Emoryviile Policemen James W. Adams and Alto Bortz, driving along a highway near Emoryzille, sighted a strange formation flare in the sky. A patroiman Wayne Van Slyke said he watched it disappear as it went off toward Hayward. He said it seemed to be weaving from side to side as it went.
It appeared to be a light bulb, moving up and down at a terrific speed. At first it seemed to be getting smaller; then it moved up and down several times, going faster and faster. Then it just disappeared. There was no noise, said the patrolman.
Officer Karl G gave almost precise description of what Robert Gornann saw in sky earlier. Many people here believe these things to be flying saucers from another world. But Gornann insists they can be explained by some other means, and are not SPACESHIPS.
Still the reports of night-time phenomena continue. People claim they see objects that appear and disappear in the sky. But if these are not space ships from another world, what can they be?

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Thousands See 'Bulb' Whirl Over Bay Area
(Continued from Page One)
BERKELEY - At first a mere pinpoint of light against the vast panorama of the sky, it grew in size and brilliance until the whole wide heavens above the Bay, the peninsula, and Marin County turned The Dazzlin,
until its intense luminare celestial display of lights itself.
VIEW FROM GATE HOUSE
What thousands saw was characterized by Charles Peterson, of 149 Irving Street, He said: "It first appeared at 6:55 p. m. and for five minutes thereafter a gleaming white light pulsated and swayed high in the sky."
He said It seemed at first about as high as a star, but high, nevertheless, and as it grew in size and brilliance, it gave the appearance of a giant fluorescent light bulb. 
"At times it would be more intense and brilliant but it never went out. There were no colors, just a tremendous white glare.
Suddenly it seemed to tilt and take on a more rounded shape. Thereupon it whirled in an elliptical path at tremendous speed, always maintaining its steady glow.
Suddenly a tail as bright as the bulb itself seemed to burst from behind the glowing mass and streaked off into the distance.
"It was much too high to be a flare, and certainly not a plane or anything else I have ever seen in the skies," Peterson declared.
SAME FROM BRIDGE
Turner, a bridge tender on the University Avenue Bridge, spotted the phenomenon from his vantage point and estimated its altitude at 5,000 to 10,000 feet. He declared:
"It was a white ball of light, approximately 25 to 30 feet high. It was traveling in a westerly direction, going from east to west, and would disappear for five to 10 seconds, and then reappear, only to disappear again directly over the Golden Gate Bridge. When it would reappear, the appearance of the light was very brilliant, electric like while in. motion."
"But it was too slow for a falling star, and too fast for a meteor," he added.

At 8:20 a. m. yesterday, Highway Patrolman George Kenyon, on the Bay Bridge, reported a similar sighting through binoculars. He said:
"The first time I saw it, it was about 5,000 feet high, judging by the height of the South Tower of the Bay Bridge. There was no sound, and it was perfectly round, brilliant white in color, and watched it for two minutes and saw it disappear in the distance."

AT 9:15 A. M. YESTERDAY
At 9:15 a. m. yesterday, the phenomenon was again spotted by bridge tenders, crossing the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. It was traveling in an easterly direction, and was sighted for about two minutes. The patrolman on duty declared:
"It was a white ball of light, approximately 5,000 feet high. It was traveling in a westerly direction, going from east to west, and would disappear for five to 10 seconds, and then reappear, only to disappear again directly over the Golden Gate Bridge. When it would reappear, the appearance of the light was very brilliant, electric like while in motion. 
"But it was too slow for a falling star, and too fast for a meteor," he added.

At 8:20 a. m. yesterday, Highway Patrolman George Kenyon, on the Bay Bridge, reported a similar sighting through binoculars. He said:
"The first time I saw it, it was about 5,000 feet high, judging by the height of the South Tower of the Bay Bridge. There was no sound, and it was perfectly round, brilliant white in color, and watched it for two minutes and saw it disappear in the distance."
