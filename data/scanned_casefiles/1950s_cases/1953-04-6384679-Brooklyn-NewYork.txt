The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet with handwritten text describing an observation of an unidentified flying object.

The text reads:

1. Sightings are not reported in local news papers, although there are several sightings frequenty in New York. This object would not have been noticed under normal conditions.

2. Several witnesses at the sight of the right observer. This happened on officer who had received the duty of observing the sky. He described them as oval shaped and elongated like a cigar. They were maneuvering in the sky. 

3. The witnesses were possibly 25 people or more in the same block with some, how ever the object caused considerable effect.

4. They were an elongated cylindrical shape - that the object didn't which an off.

My brief impressions were a sighting - similar to those seen in propulsion in the poll - and occasionally at other times of the year. Of these I have seen many.

However, almost instantly the object resulted its full glare and started off at an apparent enormous speed. It was only about a minute that I noticed that I had never seen a meteor that had the following characteristics:
(1) - Left no visible trail.
(2) - Became brighter as it descended, unlike meteors which usually become dimmer.
(3) - Showed a definite elongated shape - elliptical or cigar-shaped, rather than a point.
(4) - Traveled so slowly - 
(5) - Any other motion seen more like a "float" upwards, seemed to have a "trail" behind.

4. The color changed or followed -
(1) - Brilliant white similar to a flash of photomagnesium.
(2) - Almost instantly was larger - circle - yellow in color.
(3) - Short spits very thin with more light under white center.
(4) - At end of path were ellipsital shape, most definite color (almost black) circles or spherics center, and orange colored surrounding envelope.
(5) - appeared slightly smaller, and went out.

USAPTIS
5. This officer were not on of the following familiar effect:
(a) airplanes - running lights or exhaust
(b) Search lights - there were no signs of the existence of such apparats on beam of light to the object
(c) Reflection or reflection of any illuminated hand
lights - again the to clean and effect seemed
too low.
(d) Meteor - as material after did not resemble
any previously observed and describedata.
(e) after burners of a jet - no flames came - neither
was it any flashing or glow, back ground were clear
seem it always moved as a dark silhouette of a low figure
plane.
5. The apparent change in course could be an error
because the first sighting of a viewpoint
of flight dire were very short maybe Ve sec.
It may could be due to effect coming in perpendicular
to any line of travel flight and making a wide angle
bank - resulting in a pattern of a side shaped effect
which so far presented along its course. Detailed and
more and more careful examination and investigation
which involved friendly and cooperative consultation
may very possibly lead to an explanation.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photographic image. The sketch depicts what seems to be an object or UFO-like phenomenon, with various annotations and measurements around it.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Here is a rough sketch of how the sighting appeared:

LIGHT CUT
X - 0 X
X - 0 X
1/2 SEC.
2 SHINY
THERE

NOTE: PASSED SLOWLY
FROM RT TO LEFT EDGE
SOUND - NONE

NOTE - THE OBJECT IS DRAWN WHERE APPROXIMATELY
FULL SIZE AS IT APPEARED TO ME. 

  As per the sighted account, the estimate of 150-200 yards is merely a guess - assuming that it were similiar in size and distance (see 45 ft) to an airliner.

  On the distance - it could have been more than 200 yards, but hardly less, since the angle subtended by it was not at all imperceptible, but quite distinct.

  Against appeared to be traveling in a SW'N - NW direction towards Jamaica Bay in the vicinity of Rockaway Beach.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a point labeled "A" on it, and another point labeled "B" on the same curved line. This sketch appears to be explaining how to determine the height of an object above the horizon based on the viewer's observation.

The second sketch is larger and contains two separate diagrams. The larger diagram shows a road with buildings on either side, and a person standing in the foreground. The smaller diagram shows a more distant landscape with a curved horizon line.

OCR Output:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
