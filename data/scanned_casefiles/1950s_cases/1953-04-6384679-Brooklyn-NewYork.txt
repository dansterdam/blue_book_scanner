1. Sightings were not reported in local news papers.
2. Although there are several military people in New York, the object would not have been noticed unless someone glanced at the sky at the right moment. I happened to go up to see if the sky was clear of clouds in an effort to judge the next day's weather.

There were no one else in the same block with me, how many other people were on this block in the neighborhood, I have no way of knowing.

3. As I glanced away from the sky the object appeared.
My first impression was an airplane - but the light didn't jive on and off.
My 2nd impression was a meteor - similar to that seen in profusion in the fall - and occasionally at other times of the year. Of these I have seen many.

However, almost instantly the object reached its full size and started off on our apparent horizontal course.

At this time I decided that I had never seen a meteor that had the following characteristics:

O - Left no visible trail.
O - Became large and changed color.
O - Such a low altitude - definite line of acceleration between object and star.
O - Traveled as slowly -
O - Any other meteor seen were bright, appeared very far away, seemed to have a trail behind.

4. The color changed or followed -
O pinpoint of light similar to star of first magnitude -
O - almost instantly was large - color - yellow
O - shot fairly very thin path were bright white
    with dark center - then deep shape -
O - at end of path was elliptical shape
    with definite clear (almost flesh) circle or spherical
    center and orange colored surrounding envelope.
O - appeared slightly smaller, and went out -

5. - This object was not on of 16th following familiar
objects -

(1) airplane - seeming lights on exhaust.

(2) search light - there was no low hanging
clouds or beam of light to the object

(3) reflection or refraction of automobile head
lights - again sky the clear and object seems
too low.

(4) Motion - as mentioned before did not resemble
any previously or later seen.

(5) after burst of a jet - speed appeared too
slow - no second at any time - before, during
or after sighting - the sky back ground was clear
enough to observe any dark outline of a low flying
plane -

6. The apparent change in course could be an error
because the time from the first sighting of a perpendicular
of light to full high was very short maybe 1/2 sec-
or it could be due to object coming in perpendicular
to my line of sight and making a slight angle
band - revealing a pattern of a disc shaped object
which or at preceded along its course leveled out
more and more causing it to take on its final elliptical
shape - and finally turning on edge to disappear -

Here is a rough sketch of how the sighting appeared:

[Handwritten notes and diagram showing movement of objects, with labels like "Night out", "1-2 sec.", "Bright white", "1/4 sec.", with a sketch of objects moving across a field or sky]

Note - Rounded trailing end or tight draw shape.

Note - The object is shown here approximately full size as it appeared to me.

One for or speed went the estimate of 150-200 mph, to purely a guess - assuming that it was similar in size and altitude (500 ft) to an airliner.

Or for distance - it could have been 200 or 1200 cms. But to it was impossible to judge the sky against the back ground of stars.

Sight appeared to be traveling in a SW or SSW course headed towards Jamaica Bay in the vicinity of Rockaway Point.
