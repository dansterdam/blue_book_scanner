Mystery Objects
Follow Air Liner

LONDON, June 30 (P)— A British Overseas Airways Corp. pilot said tonight a large object and six smaller ones accompanied his Stratocruiser for eight miles today as it crossed the Atlantic headed for London.

Capt. P. R. Howard, a veteran of 150 Atlantic crossings, said the objects resembled "a large burst of flak and six smaller globes." All but one of his crew and many of the plane's passengers saw the objects, Capt. How- ard said.

He said the incident occurred at midnight 19 p. m. E.D.T. yesterday 150 miles southwest of Labrador. An American jet took off from Goose Bay, Labrador, to intercept the objects, but they "faded" as the appeared.

'Flying Jellyfish' Tailed
Plane, Crewmen Report

LONDON, July 1—The crew
of a British airliner reported the
plane was followed last night
by 50 miles by seven weird
flying black objects near Goose
Bay, Labrador.

Capt. James Howard, pilot of
the New York-London Air
liner, said the mysterious craft
vanished when a US Air Force
lighter plane came to investigate.

The British Overseas Airways
Corp. (BOAC) stratocruiser was
at 1,900 feet about 150 miles
southwest of Goose Bay when
the objects appeared.

"They flashed into sight suddenly and obviously were not
aircraft as we know them," Capt. Howard said. "All appeared black, and I will swear
they were solid. They might
have been five miles away. They
stayed with us 15 minutes.

"There was a big central object which appeared to keep
changing shape—flying jellyfish," we dubbed it.

"Sometimes it was wedgeshaped, sometimes like a dumbbell, sometimes like a sphere
with a tail-like projections. The
smaller objects dodged about, either in front or behind.

All 10 members of the crew
agreed with his description,
and those of the 51 passengers
who were awake at the time of
sighting.

CASE SUMMARY NUMBER 3

On 30 June 1954 a British Overseas Airways pilot, flying in the Labrador area, reported sighting a peculiar type of wavering light formation in the sky. He described it as being one large object surrounded by several smaller objects and having a jelly fish like appearance.

A subsequent report from a ship at sea appeared to describe the same phenomena at approximately the same location. The ship definitely identified the sighting as the planet Mars and went on to state that mirror conditions were prevailing on that date.

Project Blue Book evaluated the sighting as an inversion reflection of the planet Mars.

An ATIC evaluation of this report was furnished to the British Air Ministry upon their request.

Studies of the photograph together with other extensive investigation indicated that the light was neither a material object nor a reflection from a material object.

[The rest of the text is partially legible but difficult to fully transcribe with complete accuracy. Some words and phrases are clear, but there are sections where the text is blurry or faded. A full verbatim transcription would require careful review to ensure accuracy.]

The document appears to be a confidential report dated September 11, 1956, with the month "JUNE" written at the top of the page. The text is handwritten and somewhat challenging to read in its entirety.

"The explanation was quite simple. The hot day had warmed the air close to the pavement, but the cooling of the surface at the onset of darkness had caused a layer of warm air to be sandwiched in between the cold air close to the road surface and the cold air above. This acted like a lens which produced an out-of-focus image of a bright tavern sign more than fifty miles away, a real mirage.

There were few cars on the road, but as we met them the effect was most startling because some of them were so enlarged by the lens effect that a car a miles away seemed to be rushing directly at us only a block or two ahead. Sometimes these cars would appear to come to a sharp stop, reverse their course and disappear in the distance. At other times they would appear to be rushing on us upside down, with part of the road itself in the sky. Altogether it was a weird experience, but not in any sense supernatural. Lenses of air, either close to the ground or in the sky, can produce strange illusions."

In this case, as in many UFO puzzles, the solution depended on a knowledge of the weather conditions and of the facts of local geography. If the pursuing car had turned off the road or stopped for the night before reaching the tavern, the specific cause of the phenomenon might still be a mystery.
