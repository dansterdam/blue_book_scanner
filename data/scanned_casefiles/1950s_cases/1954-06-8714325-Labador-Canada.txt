Howard, AAC Pilot, on 30 June 1954. Records in ATIB-5 showed that the sighting had been reported earlier to HQ 23rd AD as "UFO sighting", and that HQ 23rd AD had notified ATIC and had received a reply on 7 September that no further action was required as the sighting had been explained as a natural phenomenon. ATIC informed Sgt Leader Bentley that the report had been closed. He stated that he would try to locate a COPY of the message, however, he is scheduled to visit ATIC on 19 October 1954, and will personally coordinate the matter with ATIC-5.

Mystery Objects Follow Air Liner
GANDER, June 20â€”Canadian witnesses and crew members of an Overseas Airways Corp. pilot saw strange objects and lights accompany his airliner as it crossed the Atlantic to Gander, Nfld., it was learned today at it crossed the air liner's path. P.R. Howard, a veteran of 350 Atlantic crossings, said the objects remained for some time and seemed to follow the airliner at times. He said many of the plane's passengers also saw the objects, Capt. Howard said. 
He said the incident occurred at midnite on July 2, 150 miles southwest of Gander, as the plane took off from Gander Bay, Labrador, en route to Gander, but they "faded" as the plane approached Gander.

LONDON, July 1 - The crew of an airliner reported the strange object that tailed their plane for so miles by seven weird-looking black objects near Goose Bay, Labrador. 
Capt. Howard said: "All appeared black, and I will swear they were something. They stayed with us 15 minutes."
That was in the caboose, which appeared around the airliner. sometimes like a sphere and sometimes like a smaller slender object. It stayed with the plane for 15 minutes, Capt. Howard said. "They were object, either in from or behind the plane. All 10 members of the crew agreed with his description, as did those who were awake at the time of the sighting."

CASE SUMMARY NUMBER 3

On 20 June 1954 a British Overseas Airways pilot, flying in the Labrador area, reported sighting a peculiar type of wavering light formation in the sky. He described it as being one large object surrounded by several smaller objects and having a jelly-like appearance.

A subsequent report from a ship at sea appeared to describe the same phenomena at approximately the same location. The ship maintained that the sighting as the objects were on to state that atmospheric conditions were prevailing on that date.

Project Blue Book evaluated the sighting as an inversion reflection of the planet Mars.

An ATIC evaluation of this report was furnished to the British Air Ministry upon their request.

This case is interesting in that the object was seen and described by several reliable witnesses, all of whom were pilots and other persons with technical training. The appearance of the object and its behavior were somewhat unusual and unexplained.
On the evening of 8 June 1954, at about 8:00 pm, several persons in Labrador, Canada, including a number of pilots, saw a bright, disc-shaped object in the sky. The object was estimated to be about 40 feet in diameter and was observed for about 10 to 15 minutes as it hovered and moved about in the sky. It would suddenly shoot off at high speed, then stop abruptly and hover again. The object gave off a brilliant white light, which at times appeared to change to orange or reddish in color.
One of the witnesses, a pilot, stated that as the object came closer to him, he could see that it was a definite metallic, disc-shaped craft, with no visible means of propulsion. He said the craft appeared to be under intelligent control as it maneuvered in the sky.
Several other pilots and technical personnel who observed the object confirmed the details given in the above report. The Air Force investigator who handled this case stated that he could find no natural or conventional explanation for the object seen that evening in Labrador. The case remains classified as "unidentified".

July 1954
Alamosa, Colorado

One such phenomenon, which might easily have been interpreted as a flying saucer, appeared shortly after dark one evening in mid-July 1954, and was described by one of the authors (D.H.M.) of this book in a letter to a friend: "My wife and I were driving to Alamosa, Colorado, on one of the longest, straightest stretches of highway in the United States, commonly referred to as the "Sun-barrel" highway. I had turned over the wheel to her and was settling back for a rest, after a long turn at driving, when I became aware of an unusual driving behavior on her part. First she would step on the gas, then on the brakes again. What is the matter? I asked. 'See that truck ahead?' she replied. 'Every time I try to get ahead of it, it speeds up, and then it slows down when I try to give it a chance to get ahead of me. It's making me nervous.' I peered ahead through the darkness and there, outlined brilliantly with red and white lights, I studied the situation and glanced at the speedometer, which read forty miles per hour. 'Well,' I advised her, 'you certainly ought to be able to pass that dear, the way you usually drive.' And this time she really stepped on the gas, pushing the speed up to sixty, seventy, eighty, and finally eighty-five. And would you believe it, that truck took right out ahead, still holding its estimated three hundred feet clearance, and matched us for every mile of that speed. By this time I was beginning to get an idea. 'Slow down,' I said. My wife obliged me by coming to a dead stop, brakes squealing. 'Now see there,' she said, 'I just escaped running into that truck.' And the truck had stopped, still you see ahead. At this point I ventured my conclusion: 'That isn't a truck,' I explained. 'It's a flying saucer.' You know, flying saucers on the brain,' she said. Well, to shorten the story, she started the car again and the 'truck' moved off. And we chased it in that fashion for about fifty miles. On rare occasions, as we slipped slightly in a hollow, the 'truck' would seem to dash ahead at speeds close to one hundred miles an hour. Or sometimes it would jump straight up, momentarily vanish, and then drop back into the road."

The image does not contain a photograph or image. It appears to be a page of text from a UFO report document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

"The explanation was quite simple. The hot day had warmed the air above, but the coolingof the surface at the onset of darkness had caused a layer of warm air to overly a layer of cooled air. This inversion had produced an optical effect that formed a moving, ever-changing image of a bright tavern sign more than fifty miles away, a real mirage. There were few cars on the road, but as we met them the effect was most startling because some of them were so enlarged by the lens effect that a car five miles away seemed to be rushing directly at us only a block or two ahead. Sometimes these cars would appear to come to a sharp stop, reverse their course and disappear in the distance. At other times they would appear to be rushing on us upside down, with part of the road itself in the sky. Altogether it was a weird experience, but not in any sense supernatural. Lenses of air, either close to the ground or in the sky, can produce strange illusions.

In this case, as in many UFO puzzles, the solution depended on a knowledge of the weather conditions and of the laws of local geography. If the pursuing car had turned off the road or stopped, the specific cause of the phenomenon might still be a mystery."
