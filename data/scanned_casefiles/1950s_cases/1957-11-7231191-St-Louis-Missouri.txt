Approx to St. Louis

* A test run by a/c in the
area of 9 o'clock line.

At the Conclusion: Similar to
a number of reports nice clean
& just type good a/c (F. 105 wing)
at first glance appeared to a
meteor, however, time in - say left
if seen at nite, this will
little - jet aware it will move.
They do resemble meteor at night,
at dusk - even of high altitude.
