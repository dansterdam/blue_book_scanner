Comment: a. It's somewhat surprising that someone who claims to have observed a dim moving object at for almost 10 minutes - can not give even a general statement as to the object's size, shape, other picture, details, appearance, etc., particularly a source of well-known reporting program.

b. Nothing here except a little something was drawn/moving some 10 miles, 6 the incident. Witness could not describe.

c. Surprising that although the UFO passed over a small city like Elmont, no one else reported it.

d. After reviewing this writing for this area...

NNNN
