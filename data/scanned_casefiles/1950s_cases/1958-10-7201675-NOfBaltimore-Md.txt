On 26 October 1958 at about 2230 EST (0330 Zulktwo civilians came upon a
UFO hovering above a bridge niear Lochn Raven Dam, North of Baltimore. Their
automobile failed to function when they approached and the UFO took off vertically
about a minute afterwards. They stated that their report to the Ground Observer
Corps was scoffed at and they then reported it to the Towson Police Department. The two men suffered mild burning sensations on their faces and were examined
at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Baltimore.

An electrical report was made from Andrews Air Force Base upon receipt
of the sighting.

ATIC at Wright Patterson Air Force Base requested a detailed investigation.

I, 2d Lt Bert R. Staples, tape recorded my interview with Mr. and Mrs. at 1940 hours, EST (0040 ZULU) on 4 November 1958 at their home at NNNNNNN onnnnnn Rmad, Baltimore, Maryland.

The following narrative is a verbatim transcription from this recording:
"My name is and years old, and worn 

We were taking a ride out near Loch Raven Dam Sunday, Oct 26th. After you pass the dam itself there is a rather twisting road that goes down into a valley and obstructs your view of the lake entirely. You can't see the lake nor a bridge that leads across it. Shortly after you pass the dam, until you take a left turn, then the bridge looms up in front of you at 200 to 250 yards away. We took this left hand turn and we saw, from that distance, what appeared to be a large, flat sort of egg-shaped object hanging between 100 to 150 feet off the top of the superstructure of the bridge over the lake.

We slowed and then decided to go closer and investigate the object. We crept closer to the object along the road leading toward the bridge. When we got to within 75 or 80 feet of the bridge the car went completely dead on us. It seems as though the electrical system was affected, the dash lights went out, the head lights went out, the motor went dead. Mr. who was driving the car, put on his brakes, turned the ignition once or twice. We didn't get any whirring sound, we were pretty frightened at this point. 

We both got out of the car. On this road there is nowhere to hide or run, which is probably what he would have done. So we got the car'between the object and ourselves. We watched it from that position for approximately 30 to 45 seconds and then, I am not sure of the sequence of events but it seemed to flash a brilliant flash of white light and we both felt heat on our faces. Concurrently, there was a loud noise that I interpreted as a dull explosion and Mrs. yeard as a thunder clap.

Then very quickly so that you couldn't gain the proper sequence of events, the object started to rise vertically. It didn't change it's position, as far as we could tell, during the rinsing. Only different feature it had while it was moving was that it was very bright and the edges became diffused so that we couldn't make out the shape as it rose. It took from 5 to 10 seconds to disappear from view completely. We were very frightened.

After the object disappeared from view we turned the car around without crossing the bridge. The road is rather narrow at that point and in turning the car, I remeinber that we smashed into an embankment on one side of the road. If you will look carefully you can probably see where we hit this thing. We got back to a phone in approximately 15 minutes.

The phone booth we used was located at Loch Raven Boulevard and Joppa Road. We proceeded to call the Ground Observer Corps, with no result. Out story only elicited complete disbelief.

  REPORT NO. Andrews AFB, Washington 25, D. C. 

After this unsuccessful attempt to report what we saw, we called the Towson Police Department. They told us there were two patrolmen coming over and we waited for these two patrolmen.

We told them what we had seen and at this time both Mr.                     and myself noticed burning sensations of the skin of our faces and a dryness of the eyes. Mr.                     was rather worried about this and after we finished reporting what we had seen at the dam, to the police, we proceeded to St. Joseph's Hospital in Baltimore and were given a cursory examination and dismissed.

Then we returned home, individually. "

The following account of the incident was given by Mr.               :

"My name isI live                             . I am 27 years old and a collection manager for a finance company.

At approximately 1030, riding along Loch Raven Boulevard, we came around a bend. It was extremely dark, visibility was clear, there were constellations, etc., in the sky. To our recollection there was no moon. 
We came across an egg-shaped object hovering over Bridge Number 1. This is just after you pass the dam. It was approximately, to our knowledge 75 to 150 feet high. There is some doubt to exactly how high it was. We were rather alarmed at seeing the object and we were not qualified to tell exactly how high 
it was.

When we first saw the object it was approximately 300 yards away. We were going approximately 25 to 30 miles per hour as this was bad road. This was rather fast for this road and we slowed down to approximately 10 to 12 miles per hour and came to within approximately 75 to 80 feet of the object. 
We have no way of telling the distances exactly. After we talked it over, we figured out that it must have been approximately this distance that we are talking about. The electrical system in the car seemingly gave out, as if you had your points go up, or somebody took the battery out of the car, or some other type of disturbance of this nature. I tried to put the ignition system on but there was no whirring or anything. I put the brakes on the car and we just looked at the object through the windshield temporarily.

Then we decided to run out of the car and we decided to put the car between ourselves and the object. It was a very narrow road; on one side the lake, and on the other side of a cliff. There was no place to run. 'We probably would have it we could've but we were terrified at what we saw.

We thought maybe it was a Navy blimp. We tried to rationalize what it was. Of course, the fact that the electrical system in our car conked out, made us a little suspicious as to what it might have been.

We figure,or estimate the approximate size of this Object, be followed by the formula C2 = A2 ± B2 or C2 = 75 feet' ± (120 feet) which would give approximately the size of the object. Although we are not sure, we estimate it was approximately 100 feet long since it occupied approximately one-third

of the bridge, at the height it was at. We watched it for approximately 30 seconds and then it seemingly gave off a terrifically bright light.

It had been glowing with an iridescent glow before hand but this light seemingly was blinding and approximately at the same time we felt tremendous heat wave. It didn't seem like the heat of a burning object but something like a ultraviolet light or some kind of radiation. We didn't seemingly think it was like the heat from a blast furnace.

The object disappeared from view within approximately 5 to 10 seconds after giving off a tremendous thunder clap, something approaching a plane breaking the sound barrier. After it disappeared from sight we came back into the car and turned the ignition system on and it immediately went into operation. We approached to within the bridge, backed up before crossing the bridge, and immediately, at great speed, came back to Loch Raven and Joppa Roads.

We discussed the thing and didn't know what the heck to make of it, but we figured we would at least report it either to the Police or the Ground Observer Corps to try to find out if anyone else in the area had possibly heard the sound or had possibly seen the object. We came into the booth at Loch Raven and Joppa Roads and we called the Ground Observer Corps.

Immediately after calling, the Ground Observer Corps member said, "Aww, Come on now," and I said "I would just like to report this thing. I am not interested in asking whether you believe it or not but I would like to find out if anyone else in the area has possibly reported the thing." He says, "Aww, Come on now," he said there were Navy blimps in the area but when we insisted that the thing was probably no blimp, he hung up on us.

It was at that time that we wanted to try to get confirmation of the report, not to make publicity or make names for ourselves, but to see if anyone else had possibly heard the thing. We decided to call the police.

Two policemen came to the scene and began taking a report. We at the time questioned, "This won't get any further than possibly going to the Air Force?" and he claimed that it wouldn't.

At the time we were reporting the thing we noticed a burning sensation on our faces. We didn't pay too much attention at the time except to ask the police if they had noticed if our faces were red. The policemen said that they didn't but we still noticed the burning sensation. After making the report we left the police and went to St. Joseph's Hospital to try to determine if possibly they were some kind of radiation burns or any other type of thing that we might have received. The doctor looked at our faces and claimed that Mr. _____ face was slightly red and that mine wasn't. He, of course, looked at us thoroughly, took our pressures and everything. It was only a superficial examination but he claimed we had nothing to worry about. A police sergeant at the scene, who seemingly had gone to radio active class of some kind, mentioned that if it had been a radioactive burn we wouldn't have been burned immediately and it would have taken some time

develop. This of course led us to believe that we didn't have to worry too much about the radioactivity. We left the hospital and went home that night.

The next day my face did become a little redder and it was apparently noticeable to anyone who spoke to me. "

DISCUSSION

A discussion period now follows, with Lt. Staples questioning, where details and further questions are answered.

Q. Mr. I believe you have a correction to made on your statement?
A. Yes, what I was figuring out was not the size of the object by this pythagorean theorem, but the distance from the point of sighting to the object, which was approximately 400 feet. This C = A2 + B2 bit, I was making a mistake there.
Q. What color was the glow that you observed?
A. Mr. Irridescent white, whiteish coloration not to be called white like white but sort of like a moon glow, but not exactly a cold milky white.
Q. Do you agree Mr.
A. Yes, I do, it wasn't bright enough to mar the outline or shape of the object, but it was bright enough so that if you looked into it or at it you couldn't make out any surface features.
Q. Did you notice any discernable features or details of the object?
A. Mr. None at all.
Mr. None other than possibly superficially it looked like an egg.
Q. Did it have any tail, trail or exhaust?
A. Mr. Do you mean while it was hovering over the bridge, or when it took off?
Q. Either hovering or on take-off.
A. Mr. No, not that we know of.
Mr. No.
Q. Did it make any manuevers on take-off?
A. Mr. None that we can recall except to go vertically upward.

Mr. ______ No, I can’t recall any maneuvers as such as it rose.

Mr. ______ We call it hovering, like it might have been caught in the wind. It might have moved a little bit as it was hovering over the bridge, that could have been a maneuver, we are not sure.

Q. You say you were out for a drive and not on a fishing trip, is that correct?

A. Mr. ______ Yes, the paper reported this from the police report. We happened to be riding, we weren’t fishing, I never fished in my life.

Q. What was the approximate distance from the bridge where your electrical system in the car failed?

A. Mr. ______ It was approximately 75 to 80 feet away from the bridge not from the object, which was about 75 to 100 or so feet above the bridge.

Q. You did not make any attempt after you got out of the car to approach the object.

A. Mr. ______ No, through fear we decided, I mean, we decided to put the car between us and the object.

Mr. ______ To the contrary, if there had been anywhere to hide our persons I feel most assuredly we would have hidden ourselves.

Q. Mr. ______, were you treated for any burns on the face?

A. Mr. ______ At the hospital I was given, as ______ puts it, a cursory examination, a very superficial one. Mr. ______’s face was noticeably red, mine wasn’t. He didn’t examine us but this police sergeant, as I told you, told us we didn’t have anything to worry about as far as radioactive burns. The doctor seemed very limited on knowledge about what was happening. He took our pressure but it was a very limited examination to say the least.

Q. Would you give the name of the hospital and the doctor, if you can remember, and the address of the hospital?

A. Mr. ______ The hospital was St. Joseph’s on North Caroline Street. The doctor’s name, it was an intern, I can’t tell you his name…

Mr. ______ His first name was ______

Mr. ______ That would be enough to get in touch with him if you would like to, his first name I remember definitely was Mario.

Mr. ______ Well, it was 12 o’clock at night, the police sergeant and lieutenant who came down, by the way, we don’t know their names either, I am sure that it can be verified or checked very easily.

department at St. Joseph's, we only came for treatment there. They
happened to be called by the nurse to see if anyone in the police depart

A. Mr.  I received a telegram Monday, no, wait a minute, I received the
telegram Thursday. The telegram said, "Will you please call the
following number: North... " I forgot. It was signed by Dr.
It said to call from two to five (PM) Friday or Saturday.
    I decided to call Friday around 11 o'clock and an individual,
I believe, answered the phone saying he was authorized to take
the call. He wanted to know a little bit about what happened, he said
he would like to come over to the house to investigate. He said he had
geiger counters and all the paraphanalia with which he was equipped
to investigate. I asked him "Are you a government agency?" He says,
"We are not in any way connected with the government, but we do in
vestigate phenomena of this type. " I said, "It's perfectly all right with
me," and we arranged that he was to come over Saturday between 2 and
3 o'clock (PM). Saturday at approximately 2:30 (PM) he came over to
the house and at that time I reported another circumstance that I hadn't
mentioned before, about white spots over the car. They took samples
of this for spectroscopic analysis. We went to the scene at Loch

Roven and they took "magnetized readings" of the bridge. It seemed presumably that if an object was exposed to radioactivity there would be a depolorization of an object that was exposed to radioactivity, of course, this is the way they explained it to me, I am not a physicist myself. 

Mr. What they told me was that just the top portion of it showed any magnetism, the top portion of the superstructure. 

Mr. Well, see they didn't tell this to me, they mentioned to me.... 

Mr. Mr. told me that it was slight but it did show some sort of magnetic....

Mr. Well, at any rate, at the scene, they took measurements where we were, they took pictures, motion pictures of me, my burns and everything around me, and of the car. A very complete investigation, I might add. There was an engineer among them, an electrical engineer, so lie claimed, there was a lawyer among them, there was an insurance agent among them. cos i ho is a full time mon with the organization, under I myself, was among the crew. I must add that they were competent, qualified at any rate, and they came book to the house and quizzed both and myself further on the incident. They hod tape recordings made of the whole bit and it was quite conclusive, in fact, more conclusive than the present examination we are undergoing now.

Q. Hove you heard from this organization since the investigation they made?

A. Mr. No, we were told their report would appear in their publication which. I forgot, which is published bi-weekly or bi-monthly or something along these lines. I am not sure.

Mr. I told him not do do that. 

Mr. You told him not to?

Mr. Sure, with national publicity, I'd have every crank in the country calling me instead of every crank in the city.

Mr. Well, then that't all we know about that.

Q. You said the object was about a third the length of the bridge?

A. Mr. At the height we reported it, it appeared to covef one-third of the bridge. Our measurements are not accurate, we, of course, seem to differ on how long the bridge was, says the bridge was at least 200 yards.

Mr. Yooh, I feel the bridge is 200 yards.

Mr. And I say 300 feet, I am not sure myself. At the scene, after

Q. You said you observed the object from behind the car for approximately 30 seconds?

A. Mr.      ~After we got out of the car it was 30 seconds we actually watched it. 

Q. You also stated that the object in relation to the road and yourself seemed to be either over or a little to your side of the bridge and not beyond it? 

A. Mr.      ~That's what I would say, what do you say.....?

Mr.        ~If anything it was a little more toward our side, more than likely, because of looking up and so on, it probably was over the bridge itself, directly over the bridge. 

Mr.       ~You seem to be using that as a focal point, the bridge.

A. Mr.       ~For what?

Mr.      ~For what? Like it was on strings. (Pause) I am sorry I saw it; I wish I hadn't seen it. I'd rather not be going through all this interrogation. I did see .. something like this. I hoped that if would see would add to the national interest or national information that would maybe help understand these things a little better.

UFO SIGHTING
LOCK RAVEN DAM, NORTH OF BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
26 October 1958

On 26 October 1958 two men were driving near Lock Raven Dam, which is north of Baltimore, Maryland. As they rounded a curve in the road, near a bridge they sighted what appeared to be a large, flat and sort of egg-shaped object hanging between 100 and 150 feet off the top of the superstructure of the bridge.

They slowed their car but decided to go closer and investigate the object. They slowly drove closer to the object along the road leading to the bridge. When they were within approximately 75 or 80 feet of the bridge, the car went completely dead. The witnesses reported it seemed as if the entire electrical system was affected, the dash and head lights went out when the motor went dead. The driver of the car put on the brakes and tried to start the car but got no reaction whatsoever.

The witnesses became frightened and both got out of the car, and hid behind it in the absence of any other cover. From this vantage point they watched the UFO for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. Suddenly the UFO seemed to flash a brilliant white light, and both witnesses reported they felt heat on their faces. Concurrently, there was a loud noise which they interpreted as a dull explosion or thunder clap.

Very quickly so that the witnesses didn’t know the proper sequence of events the object started to rise vertically. The object did not change its position over the bridge during the rising but did appear very bright and the edges became diffused so that its shape couldn’t be made out as it rose. It took from 5 to 10 seconds to disappear completely.

After the object disappeared from view, the witnesses turned the car around, which started without any trouble, and rushed back to the nearest telephone to report the incident. The phone was reached 15 minutes after the incident, and the sighting was reported to the Towson Police Dept., which sent over two patrolmen to interview the witnesses.

After reporting the sighting to the patrolmen, the witnesses experienced a burning sensation of the skin and proceeded to St. Joseph’s Hospital in Baltimore where they were given an examination and dismissed. The witnesses returned home individually.

Notes: The bridge is a double-arched, steel-frame construction with a concrete road bed. It has a fresh coat of dark green paint and is about 40 feet high at the maximum height of each arch. The entire bridge is about 500 feet long (0.1 mile), and the point at which the UFO was first seen was approximately 3/4 mile or one mile away.

There was no unusual meteorological activity in the area, no thunderstorms and quite clear. Visibility at Friendship Airport was 20 miles at 0100, 27 Oct 58.

This case was extensively investigated; however, no valid conclusion could be reached as to the nature of the object or phenomena, and it remains unidentified. The available evidence does not indicate that this object or phenomena constitutes a threat to the security of the United States.

a. Civilian - Name, Grade, Organization, Duty, and Estimate of Reliability:

[Redacted]
Estimated reliability: Qualified above average.
[Redacted] is a student and a member of a local (Gardenville) Astronomical Society. He is in the process of becoming a member of the GOC.

Judging from my conversation with him he displayed a keen interest in UFOs and was well informed on the subject. He seemed to be very conscientious and assured me that he could distinguish aircraft from other objects.

I would estimate his reliability to be above average because of his interest in plane spotting and astronomy and experience in the local astronomical club.

The Ground Observer Corps (blacked out) had not logged any record of any UFO reported on 26 October 1958.

St Joseph's Hospital had neglected to make any written report of the "superficial examination" but they did recall the incident. The desk nurse, Miss (blacked out) called the Northeastern Baltimore Police District for aid and advice since no one at the hospital had any experience with radio-logical burns.

The nurse contacted Lt. Cummer and Sgt Hirsch of the police department and both of these men went to St Joseph's Hospital and rendered advice to the UFO observers. No treatments were administered.

Both (blacked out) and (blacked out) appeared to be well educated and spoke in an intelligent manner. They seemed sincere and they indicated that they did not want publicity. 

The parts of their statements related to the Ground Observer Corps and St Joseph's Hospital were borne out by telephone conversations between GOC and hospital personnel, and myself.

The observers' reports were logical, consistent and coherent. Neither of the observers' occupations involve observation reporting or technical knowledge. My estimate of the reliability of the observers: Excellent.

The sighting made could have been the same object, since the color (glowing white) and the approximate time agrees. 

Five photographs of the scene where taken on 13 November 1958 at approximately 1200 to 1300 hours EST by a photographer from Andrews Photographic Laboratory. These photos are inclosed.
While enroute to take these photographs I had an opportunity to talk with the manager of a restaurant located across the lake from the bridge where the UFO was sighted. The restaurant was on Loch Raven Road. I had stopped to ask directions and it was mentioned that the manager had made a similar nighttime sighting on the night following the reported UFO. The manager was driving down Loch Raven Road (the same road that the bridge is located on ) while taking one of his employees home: can be reached c/o

Both and simultaneously pointed to a "glowing light" hovering over a field. The time was accurately established as being between 2105 and 2115 EST on 27 Oct 58. The object appeared suddenly and as and continued down the road towards it, it just as suddenly disappeared. description of the disappearance at the time was, "Look, it disintegrated!" The object was in sight less than a minute and no noise accompanied its disappearance.

Neither nor reported this because they felt that they would be called "crazy."

Upon returning to work the following evening a Mr. and Mrs. (other employees at the Baltimore, Maryland mentioned that on their way home the evening before, 27 October 1958, (at about the same time the were driving home) they saw a "glowing object hovering in a field." They also did not report this 

mentioned that several employees heard the noise which was reported by the evening of 26 October 1958, but no one saw the object. described the sound as a "Double boom" -- a "boom .... boom" in quick succession.

To the investigator his description did seem like the sound of an aircraft breaking the sound barrier. The second "boom" may have been an echo of the first.

The restaurant has a picture window which gives a full view of the bridge across the lake. The distance is about 4-5 miles across the lake. It happened that no one was in view of the bridge at the time of the UFO sighting.

AN but they did hear the noise at that time on 26 October 1958. I would estimate that the manager of the restaurant, was extremely reliable and along with Mr. and Mrs. would be in the "excellent reliability" class. appeared to be around 48-50 years old and seemed to be very conservative. He was conscientious because of his high position (manager in a very reputable restaurant) as was indicated by his refusal to report his sighting because of the fear that someone would think he was "crazy." SUMMARY: Since several reliable witnesses heard the same noise that reported in connection with their UFO on 26 October 1958 (around 2230 EST ), it can be assumed that the sighting did actually occur as re-lated except for the distances described. It can safely be assumed that the sighting on the following night 27 October 1958 was also reliable because of the four observers involved. Upon visiting the bridge and surrounding area where the UFO was sighted, the following observations were made by the investigator: The bridge is a double-arched, steel-frame construction with a concrete road bed. It has a fresh coat of dark green paint and is about 40 feet high at the maximum height of each arch. The whole bridge is about 500 feet long (0.1 mile) and the point at which the UFO was first seen must have been 3/4 mile or possibly a mile away and not 300 yards as reported. There was no usual meterological activity in the area, no thunderstorms and the weather was quite clear. Visibility at Friendship International Airport was 20 miles at 0100 EST, 27 October 1958. The height of the observation, about 150 feet, precludes the possibility of the object being an aircraft. Natural fluorescent gases, etc., can be ruled out due to the noise involved. No special projects are known to be operating in that area. As far as this investigation has gone, this UFO remains unidentified.

EXPLANATION OF PHOTOGRAPHS 
 Photograph number 1 was taken from the point on the road that   and     first sighted the UFO. The distance from this point to the bridge 
is about 3/4 mile to 1 mile (due East from road to bridge). 

Photograph number 2 was taken about 300 yards from the North end of the bridge. 

Photograph number 3 was taken at the North end of the bridge at the point where          and          claimed their car failed to function. This is about 75 to 80 feet from the bridge structure. 

Photograph number 4 is a shot from the South end of the bridge. 

Photograph number 5 was taken from the South end of the bridge. To give an idea of the height of the bridge the person in the picture is 5' 10" and the top of the hat would be about 6' from the road bed of the bridge. Judging from this the first upright girder would be about 21 feet high.
