AERIAL OBJECTS:

At approximately 2140 hours, 29 August 1952, I, Master Sergeant [redacted], CO Section XX Corps, Camp Polk, Louisiana, while sitting in my office window, Marksville, Louisiana, in such a position that I could see out of the doorway, I observed a light moving across the sky was to last a relatively short time.

Initially, when I first and watched the moving light, being my tempo as a means to measure the site, I noticed my thumb covered the light. The light moved to a point directly in front of me and it appeared to move approximately one (1) or two (2) seconds and blinked a red and instantly a green light turning to the original white light. It came directly toward my location and in 18 cases I noticed a red light on the right and green on the left and it passed directly over head.

It was slight aircraft approximately size of an L-19 and a motor noise similar to that. By a check of an L-19, which was hand going South and returned again passing directly over head going low. I noticed that this aircraft had to be very close before I could hear its motor. It further noticed that because of the slowness of the aircraft, could appear at night to be stationary and not diminish to a few (3) yards. I was watching the aircraft another light moved into my view from the west. This second light as close enough so as to be stationary. While I was watching both of these, two more light aircraft of the same type came overhead from the South southwest. I watched all of the aircraft approximately 15 to 20 minutes. In this report, I am familiar with the reports of observations contained in this report as I was one of the interviewers of the individual aerial observers. Because of this I was most attentive to the way the different lights could appear at night. The climatic conditions were similar to that of 19 August 52 as reported, cloudless, 20-20 vision.

CONCLUSION: All aircraft at a distance when moving away from or across the view of an observer appear as a white light out not brilliant. The undersigned is of the opinion that the aircraft which is the light rail is part of this, could while as the red and green navigation lights appear to be not as bright as the white light on the under side of the aircraft. It is possible very easy to for the white light to appear not to be for the white light or the aircraft to appear stationary not to be moving. It is possible for the white light to disappear for two (2) seconds instantly, again, while moving which are not shown on the horizontal plane of distance. The white light of the aircraft did so while I was watching it, I would not see the trace out I know that the trees were there. The undersigned also notes that the aircraft should have heard the "putt-putt" similar to that of an outboard motor. The undersigned noticed that the aircraft flying and to be close positively was most near activity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

That the airports in vie be checked for light aircraft flying on the SLAGLE LAKE AREA the night of 10:00 August 1952, a check of Camp Polk Airstrip reveals that no aircraft were flying night of 19 August 1952.

Q. Will you please identify yourself:
A. Lt Col [illegible] Armor - [illegible]
   Station: La. Military District
   On TDY, Hq Fourth Army Military Intelligence Summer
   School, Camp Polk, La., for period 17 - 31 August 1952.

Q. Time of sighting object:
A. Approximately 2100 hours, Tuesday, 19 August 1952.

Q. Climatic Condition:
A. No wind, no fog, visibility dark, cloudless, no moon, warm evening.

Q. Location:
A. Slagle Lake, (Co-ordinance 50-36) Slagle - Burden Creek,
   1/25,000 Scale.

Q. Were you accompanied by anyone else:
A. Mrs. [illegible] Purchasing & Contracting Office, Post Qr.,
   Camp Polk, La. This party can substantiate statement of
   Col. [illegible]

Q. What was the object you saw:
A. I do not know. It appeared to be 2 single lights, two separate
   objects, which seemed to be illuminated lights.

Q. What did you see:
A. Object as seen by me was in diameter about the size of a
   base-ball, one object was observed first. While looking
   due south one object came in view and from observers view
   at an angle of 45 degrees above horizontal. Attention was
   attracted by white light moving west to east. Angle of travel
   as observed was not at an excessive speed west to east and
   apparently remained stationary. In approximately two (2) minutes after becoming stationary, [illegible]


- page 12 -

another object appeared from the direction of the first object, same rate of speed, and dropped as approximately same space, two (2) to three (3) degrees west of the first object on approximately same altitude and with same color of first object. As of this, object was viewed as about same size as the first object.

(Note: First object observed will be identified as "Object #1" and second object will be identified as "Object #2" for remainder of this discussion.)

Both objects remained in place approximately one (1) minute. Object #1 was observed to take up a course moving in an angle of ninety (90) degrees angling east, north east. Noted size of object, as observed, had diminished to estimated size to 2/4.

This movement of object was approximately three (3) degrees. Upon reaching easterly position from observer object #1 became stationary. During this time object #2 has not changed position at all. Within approximately thirty (30) seconds after object #1 became stationary in an easterly position, object #1 changed color rapidly to a deep cardinal red and pulsating red 14 ft., followed by pulsating green light which appeared to be entire object itself. This covered approximately five (5) seconds period of time. Object #1 appeared to work in a close circle in this area. During object #1 movement to south, south west, object #2 was observed to start its movement along with appeared to be the identical course followed by object #1 to its original position, previously occupied. Object #2 has now moved at what appeared to be the same easterly position occupied by object #1.

Approximately thirty (30)


- page 13 -

seconds after arrival at the point of object #1, object #2 was observed to changed to pulsating red and green light, as object #1 had in the same position, after which object #2 remained stationary and turned white for approximately five (5) minutes.

After green pulsating, the object was observed to again return to its original white light. Object was observed to remain in same position. During this time object #2 remained in its original stationary position. Both objects continued to remain in position as stated for approximately two (2) minutes. Following this object #1 was observed to move in a south westerly direction at an angle estimated at 20 degrees. Object now appeared to be one of same size during this time (3/4 size of normal) and appeared to be at approximately the same altitude and had the same constant white light. This movement was estimated to be less than one (1) minute.

It was also observed that approximately two (2) minutes after object #2 ceased its green color, then object #1 was observed to commence movement west, north west and traveled to a position generally south from the observer. The size of object now appeared to be about the size of a baseball and appeared to occupy the same position as originally observed as a stationary object. Immediately following this, object #1, within thirty (30) seconds after assuming stationary position changed color to rapid red pulsating color, then changed to green giving off green pulsating color and back to original white color.

Object #1 appeared to remain a stationary as a white object.

Following the changing to the white light object #1, observed to


- page 14 -

Remain stationary for one (1) minute, then began to what appeared to be a southern direction, continuing south until it appeared to be the size of a dime and then completely disappeared. During this period object #2 continued to hold its position in the east.

Following this, object #2 appeared to retrace its original route to the south east taking up a stationary position due south of the observer with its size appearing to be the size of a base-ball.

Assuming the position, stationary position south of the observer, the object was then observed to change color to a pulsating red light followed by a pulsating green light. These pulsations lasted approximately five (5) seconds, then assumed its original white color and remained in this position for an estimated two (2) minutes. The object then appeared to move due south as object #1 diminishing in size. Over a period of approximately two (2) minutes by the time it became undistinguishable by the observer.

Q. During the movement of the objects, did you observe anything that might be identified as a vapor trail or exhaust?

A. No

CONCLUSION: The observer is of the opinion since the objects precise movement and visibility at the reported hours it could have been observed by other official sources.

RECOMMENDATIONS: That this report be disseminated to the appropriate Air Force and Army Intelligence Agencies who may have interest or relations of this report with that of others reported during the same period by other observers.

UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS

On 28 August 1952, [redacted] Post
Quartermaster, Camp Folk, Louisiana, residence address [redacted] North Camp Folk, was interviewed and stated in substance
that he and Lt. Col. [redacted] were seated on a pier
at Sale Lake (50-68) (Sagle Garden Creek, 1/2, 2000) on the
evening of 16 August 1952 when they sighted two unidentified objects.
Initial sighting were at approximately 2100 hours. [redacted] was
sitting on a pier facing approximately due east from their attention
was directed by Col. [redacted] to two lights which appeared to be fixed
in the sky at an unknown distance from the observers, approximately
140 degrees azimuth and 60 degrees vertical from the horizon. Movement of the two objects from time of initial sighting to the time of
their disappearance was as indicated on attached sketch. Total time
that the objects were observed was not more than fifteen (15) minutes
and probably closer to ten (10) minutes. [redacted] could not furnish approximate lengths of time that the objects were in the positions indicated on attached sketch. The objects were round and
appeared to be about the size of a five (5) inch disk as compared to
the size of the thumb nail held at arm's length. The objects appeared
as a white light initially. As the objects maneuvered to the positions
indicated on attached sketch, each seemed to emit red and green flashed
at the points to which they maneuvered. The original white light
remained at all times, the red and green flags of being shifted as if
they were a part of the white whole. The night was clear and dark,
there was no moon. Observation was made over a lake which had been
drained. There were small puddles of water between the observers and

some trees over which the objects were observed. There were no
distinguishing landmarks with which to determine relative distances
of the objects, but she "was not impressed" by their rapidity of
movement. The lights were neither brilliant nor glaring. The most
impressive thing about the lights were their size. They appeared
larger than aircraft warning lights or any other type lights one
ordinarily sees in the sky. The light identified as "x-2" attached
sketch disappeared momentarily after its maneuver and return to the
initial position at which it was sighted. The light (x-2) then
reappeared and finally disappeared together with x-1. There was no
fading or apparent movement away from x-1 at the time the
lights disappeared. The manner of disappearance was the same sensation
one senses when an electric light is switched off. Just
before the lights disappeared, Mrs. was straining to hear any
noise resembling the "put put of an outboard motor. Mrs. mentioned
this to Col. but Col. could not hear the
noise himself.
