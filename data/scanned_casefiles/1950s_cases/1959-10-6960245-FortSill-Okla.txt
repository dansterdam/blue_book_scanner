UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Clinton and 25 miles gallons
Date: 8 Oct 59    Hour: (6) 22:30-2

WX: Clear to some clouds with W & SE 10-15 knot

Description: Bright - Big, slow - like white turning to some at sunset - W move it appeared to have a mile or mile swirling it to light noted to be swirling gliding through the slight swirls then emitting light - over

Direction of Motion: SE

Satellites: (AFOIN-4F3, Phone 69219) None out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) None out moved in motions like turn for a planet or star

Radar Analysis (AFOIN-461) None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.) None out

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. Possibility in the field doing a balloon, quite apart from the trial movement

Other:

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Tolerance Good

Analysis and Conclusions: THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS VERY PROBABLY A BALLOON - THE FACT THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING GENERALLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND CAUSED RELATIVELY SLOW MOVEMENT TENDS TO SUBSTANTIATE THIS CONCLUSION - IN TWO WORDS THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE MOVED ONLY MOMENTARILY TO BE OF
