UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: 
Date: 
WX:
Description: "A light was observed by two observers movining/traveling west to east at a high rate of speed, disappearing behind a wooded area" 
Direction of Motion: SE
Satellites: (ARGON-4&3, Phone 69219)
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): Nil
Radar Analysis (ARGON-4&3): Nil
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): Nil
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc: Nil
Other: 
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Reliable, good
Analysis and Conclusions: "THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS MOST LIKELY A WEATHER BALLOON AS THE DESCRIPTION OF LOCATION AND DIRECTION OF TRAVEL IS CONSISTENT WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF UPPER AIR WEATHER BALLOONS IN THE AREA. THE OBSERVERS WERE FAMILIAR WITH SUCH PHENOMENA AND COULD DISTINGUISH IT FROM NORMAL AIRCRAFT. WHILE THE SPEED APPEARS UNUSUAL, IT IS CONSISTENT WITH A WEATHER BALLOON AT THAT ALTITUDE AND LOCATION. THEREFORE, THE SIGHTING IS CONSIDERED DUE TO A WEATHER BALLOON, AND NO EXTRAORDINARY EXPLANATION IS WARRANTED."

Transcribed text:

"Description cont'd:
At approximately 2:15 am, 6 Oct 59, the object was observed to move laterally for a distance of approximately 200 yards, with a definite slowing down and increase in light intensity as it progressed. Then it returned to its original position and light intensity. This action was repeated once more before it disappeared totally. The object was observed for a period of approximately 30 minutes..."
