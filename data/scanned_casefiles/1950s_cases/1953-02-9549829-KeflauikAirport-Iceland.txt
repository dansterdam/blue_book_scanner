The following radar plots were observed on radar screens of the ground control intercept and reporting units on 3 February 1953:

a. 12252 Bearing 215.9 Range 70 nautical miles (55° 27' N, 20° 30' W).
b. 12272 Fast faded after remaining 15 seconds.
c. 13561 Bearing 215.9 Range 112 nautical miles (55° 15' N, 20° 8' W).
d. 13592 Bearing 215.8 Range 113 nautical miles (55° 15' N, 20° 3' 30" W).

There were no aircraft, either military or civilian, operating in the area of the plots according to all military and civilian sources contacted.

There were close tracks unidentified, according to the Icelandic CAA, and civilian aircraft were operating in this area unknown to the Icelandic CAA.

The apparent lack of motion indicated during two full minutes is still unexplained.

1. On 29 January 1953, a radar plot was observed at Keflauik Airport, Iceland. This plot was detected and followed by the ground control approach radar system and was observed to be a high speed target.

2. The plot was observed at an altitude of around 25,000 feet and was moving at a speed of around 700 to 800 knots. The plot was observed for approximately 12 to 13 minutes.

3. As the plot approached the coast, it decreased in altitude to around 15,000 feet and then proceeded to ascend to around 30,000 feet.

4. Winds at 5,000 feet were from 270° at 30 knots, and from 10,000 feet were from 310° at 40 to 45 knots. A small amount of ground clutter was indicated on the radar.

5. Large flocks of geese were observed in the vicinity of Keflauik at around 1,000 feet and travelling in a northeasterly direction.

6. An investigation of all available sources indicated that there were no aircraft from the Icelandic Air Force or from any other known source which could be identified as the source of the unidentified radar plot. The Icelandic Air Force had no aircraft in the air at the time and could provide no further information on the incident.
