11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Three plots were observed on radar scope on a general heading of W. These plots were observed at 1525, 1530, and 1535. 

Plotting: 1. An electronic patch on or off 29 was made to C-47 in middle of Iceland. C-47 (G-47) in orbit to approximately at 1500.

All a short of 3 naval harbor had been using radar units had in area. In large flocks or groups now observed in the vicinity. No more information received, case regarded as unidentified.

1. Copies of this report will be furnished the Commanding General, EAD,
and Air Defense, USAF.

2. The following unidentified radar plots were observed on radar scopes
of the 92nd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron on 3 February 1953:

a. 12252 bearing 315° range 90 nautical miles (56° 25' N; 24° 30' W).

b. 12277 Plot failed after remaining motionless for two minutes.

c. 13362 bearing 341° range 112 nautical miles (59° 15' N; 24° 00' W).

d. 13692 bearing 318° range 113 nautical miles (59° 55' N; 29° 38' W).

3. There were no aircraft, either military or civilian, operating in the
area of the plots according to all military and civilian sources contacted.

4. These plots remain unidentified, although the possibility exists that
civilian aircraft were operating in this area unknown to the Icelandic CAA.

5. The apparent lack of motion indicated during two full minutes is
still unexplained.

1. At 1825Z on 3 February 1953, a radar plot was observed on the scope of the radar equipment of the 526th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron covering 505, range 50 nautical miles. This plot was observed for two call periods, first with one sweep, then with a second sweep. At 1827Z the plot faded. The object would appear to have been at approximately 25° 30' north, 25° 30' west.

2. It was estimated by the Aircraft Controller observing this plot that altitude of the object making the radar return was approximately 7,500 feet.

3. At 1828Z a new plot was observed on a bearing of 241° at 112 nautical miles, moving 15° at approximately 250 knots, 25° north.

4. At 1829Z another plot was observed on a bearing of 238° at 115 nautical miles, moving 15° at approximately 250 knots, 25° north, after which it faded also.

5. Investigation of all possible sources indicated that there were no aircraft, either military nor civilian, operating in the area of the plots. The movement's identification section of the 522nd Aircraft Control and Warring Center was unable to identify any of the three plots. However, the Icelandic CAA reported a C-47 inbound to Reykjavik at 1800Z approximately 45 miles north of Reykjavik. This aircraft landed at Reykjavik at 1900Z.

6. Weather in the area of the radar plots was as follows:
   a. Winds at 5,000 feet were from 270° at 30 knots, and from 10,000 feet they were from 310° to 320° at 40 to 45 knots. A small amount of frontal moisture was also indicated in that area.

7. Large flocks of geese were observed in the vicinity of Keflavik Airport at about 0500Z. They were approximately at 1,000 feet and travelling 14 was northwesterly direction.

COMMENTS:

8. To all these plots were of the same object, a minimum wind set speed of 20 knots would have been required for the object to move as was noted. This could have been just an artifact of the radar system or some other unexplained phenomenon.

9. Possibility that these were weather returns discussed by radar experts was not conclusive.

10. The investigation was continued but no further information was obtained.
