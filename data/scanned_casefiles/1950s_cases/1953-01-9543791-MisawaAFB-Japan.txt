10. CONCLUSION
POSSIBLY BALLOON

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Visual: Stationary light which continuously changed color from red to white. No terrain features were observed. Observed by AF pilot of F-94 a/c at altitude of 35,000' for a period of one minute.

Radar: Object appeared on radar scope of F-94 a/c as a weak fuzzy stationary speck for a period of 2 minutes.

COMMENTS: 1. Radar set had unusual behavior throughout mission at object and radar return seem to coincide.
2. Plane overhead object - object seemed to be rising. 50 minutes after Hizen location.

9 Jan 53                                  Misawa AFB, Japan

Object was light that continually changed color from red to white to green. No aerodynamic features or means of propulsion or exhaust or trail noted. No movement, shape or size ascertainable. Radar contact gave weak fuzzy return. Object sighted at 1500 9 Jan 53 with radar contact approximately 2 minutes, visual contact approximately 1 minute. Sighted visually without optical aids and by radar from an F-94 a/c at 35,000' speed 220 knots heading 360 degrees made radar contact with object at range of 24,000 yards, 20 deg port azimuth, 10 deg below in elevation. Pilot then sighted object visually and turned to 335 deg magnetic north heading maintaining 35,000' at all times. No apparent movement of object but after a/c changed heading object still 20 deg port in azimuth. Radar locked on at 5000 yards. As range decreased, angle of elevation of object below a/c increased. Azimuth reading remained constant. Radar contact broken with obj at range of 200 yards, 20 deg port azimuth, 40 deg below in elevation. Pilot and radar observer making sighting are members of personnel that no estimate of reliability possible. Weather was overcast from 6500' to 12,000' with visibility unlimited above overcast. Winds at 30,000' were 150 knots from 280 deg, at 35,000' were 90 knots from 270 deg, radar observer reported unusual interference on set throughout mission but not appeared to be operative before and after contact. No physical evidence available. Interception attempted but contact lost when a/c overshoot mission.

AUTC Comment: Since the radar set had unusual behavior throughout the maneuvers but object and radar return seem to coincide, it is believed that object was weather balloon launched by the AEW ANS at Misawa.
