DATE: SEPTEMBER 12, 1953

I sighted a red and white object and saw a morning light that could hardly be made of any normal objects. I could easily see that it was not normal. I circled around it to see if it had additional lights. I had a feeling that I was watching a nonsense. I was then greatly surprised to see the rather long straight tail come on the right almost instantaneously and the whole thing suddenly started to move rapidly and disappeared. I was watching it for a few minutes and thought it might be a airplane. But I finally decided that it could not be an airplane as it had an unusual tail and was flying at a very high speed and disappeared at high speed.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing an "ABNORMAL REFRACTION" incident observed by the American SS Extavia ship off the coast of Portugal on August 29, 1953. The text provides details about the ship's observation of unusual refraction and mirage-like effects during that incident.

ABNORMAL REFRACTION
SOUTH COAST OF PORTUGAL
Second Officer G. R. Dunlap of the American SS. Extavia, reports as follows: On the afternoon of August 29, 1953, at about 1300 G.M.T. an unusual observation was made. The vessel was near land in that direction, but the land appeared over 500 miles distant, a period of abnormal refraction was observed. The ship appeared to be almost completely blotted out by high buildings observed bearing 151° although the actual land in that direction was Morocco, over 200 miles distant. Other smaller buildings were observed and also what appeared to be grain elevators. Later the vessel's height decreased to what was normal.
Clear sky, surface haze, barometer 29.95 inches, air temperature 75° F.

Dear Mr. Secretary:

I am a cafe cook here in Jameston, N.D. and I witnessed just a few words for you about than an unusual flying object I saw on the night of August 27, 1952.

It was 10:00 P.M. (approximately) when I went outside for a breath of fresh air. I saw a light out of the ordinary - it was a bluish-white glow, almost immediately I was aware that it was moving rapidly and silently. It seemed to be about 200 feet up and moving in a westerly direction. It was almost immediately out of sight, so fast was its movement. 

I was so startled that I called my wife to see it, but she missed it. I would appreciate it very much if you would have someone investigate this for me, as I am almost certain that what I saw was an unusual flying object.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

To tell a correct story that came to my mind was within 3 minutes after seeing what I saw. This thing and meed a little bit about it. What came moving across the sky appeared as a fire head giving out a blinding light from it. It appeared as a fire head giving out a blinding light from the night sky, over my head, and to the right of me. When it had gone over a long, thin oblong shape, that seemed to have a light of its own also. This thing passed over with great speed. There in the city said the light was peculiar in all I can think of seeing don't it.

Yours truly
