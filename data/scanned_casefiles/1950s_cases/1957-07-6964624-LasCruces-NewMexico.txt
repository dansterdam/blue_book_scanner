RE: Deming-Columbus-Las Cruces UFO Case
7/1 July 1957

Investigative efforts in subject case reveal that scrapbook of newspaper clippings was received by AFCIN which constitutes a diary of investigative forms which my organization did not receive. This covers a considerable period.

The case has been in inactive status due to 6555th ACVORN pending processing of the available evidence. They advise that in their opinion the sources are not considered as reliable as to warrant full/detailed investigation due to the obvious unreliability of the sources. 

The case is considered closed.

Also should point out that the investigative affair was rather casual and the origin of the material was rather obscure and necessarily matters and meets no credence.

This report discusses an observation of a strange aerial object near Las Cruces, New Mexico on 6 July 1957. The observer, a private citizen, reported seeing a bright object hovering at a low altitude, performing unusual maneuvers. The object was described as circular in shape, emitting a bluish-white glow, and able to accelerate and change direction rapidly. However, the observer was unable to obtain any photographs or other physical evidence of the object.
