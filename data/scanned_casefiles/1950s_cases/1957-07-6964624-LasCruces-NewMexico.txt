RE: Deming-Columbus-Las Cruces UFO Case
14 July 1957

Investigative efforts in subject case reveal that source, Collate Weiss, was not reliable. Following her report of investigative forms which my organization sent out, we received a diary of her UFO sightings covering a considerable period.

Telephone conversation with 685th ACWRON at Las Cruces revealed the results of their investigation with the source. They stated that, in their opinion, there would be nothing gained by a full AIS investigation due to the obvious unreliability of the sources.

The case is considered closed.

Also should point out that the investigative officer of 685th ACWRON covered the area of the original "Volcano" sighting on foot and discovered nothing but rabbit tracks.

SUBJECT: Air Intelligence Information Report

TO:   Assistant Chief of Staff/Intelligence
      Headquarters, USAF
      Washington 25, D.C.

1. In accordance with paragraph 7a(2)(a), AFR 200-2, 12 August
1954, the attached AF Form 112 (Air Intelligence Information Report)
from the 685th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron is forwarded
for your information and necessary action.

2. This command contacted the 685th ACW Squadron before the
receipt of this report concerning a "diary" of UFOB sightings that
the SOURCE, Mrs. [REDACTED], had sent to this command.
The 685th ACW Squadron revealed that the SOURCE, in their
opinion, completely unreliable. Since only one of her sightings
(reference TG 685th ACW) can be substantiated by other
sources, this command concurs in the reliability estimate.

3. For the reason stated above, no further action is contemplated by this command.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UFOB Report

(1.1) Asst Director, 2.1., Thomas C. O'Brien:

"In the early part of the evening, the observer had visited a town where some men were using a telescope to look at the stars. Briefly stated his conclusion was not to focus the telescope on the vertical-type flying object with a group of lights about 45 vertical-type flying object. The observer, with his telescope, saw a helicopter, but he couldn't accept this. A little later in the evening, with the aid of binoculars, he noticed some strange lights on the horizon north of town and watched them for some time. In following these, he saw the ball of light."

"Four years ago the observer found some strange marks on the ground. Later, he told a neighbor he could see a round bottomed object. She reported that these tracks have never been verified. In July 1957 the observer reported a previous sighting to the 6th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. The investigating officer went to the local Civil Defense office where she had reported seeing the lights. During this trip in airplane she over, but the observer raised the question of the explanation can not be a popular airplane. This investigation officer also noticed a laser basket, science fiction novel, entitled "Going Into Space" lying on the observer's couch during the interview."
