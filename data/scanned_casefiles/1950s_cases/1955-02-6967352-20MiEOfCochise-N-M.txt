Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[Note: Some parts of the text are difficult to read clearly due to image quality]

[Top of page appears to have some header text, but is mostly illegible]

... VISUAL ... GROUND ...

... PILOT ... RELIABILITY ...

[Middle section text is partially legible but many words are unclear or cut off]

... CLEAR ... AT POINT ...

The text is very faint and partially obscured, making complete OCR challenging. Large portions of the text are not clearly readable.
