Attn: TDPT (UFO)

Subj: UFO Investigation

To: Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

Reference: 1. Your letter 22 May 1968, subject, UFO in... ations,
I have the following comments on all the ... you have
listed, in the order they were listed.

1. 7 January 1952, Palmer, Alaska.

I have rated this case E3 C7, meaning that as far as strange-
ness was concerned, the stimulus giving rise to this report could
have been something quite ordinary or it could have fallen into the
category of "cigar-shaped UFOs" with reports from many countries and
which have no ready explanation. In this instance, there is not
sufficient information to go on. The report we have states,
"Alaska Air Command Informed and will take further investigative
action," and, "additional data will be forwarded when available."
To the best of my knowledge the further data were never transmitted.
This plus the fact that it was reported by one woman out of 4 or 5
(not 45 as the original report stated) and the fact that it was
observed at the time of the setting sun, leads me to think that
the sighting might have had a meteorological origin. Possibly
meteorological, but data insufficient for firm evaluation. My
recommendation for this classification.

2. 14 April 1952, LaCrosse, Wisconsin...

I originally asked to review this case in the hopes that un-
known to me some additional follow up had been made. I found that
despite the fact that a captain of commercial airliner and others

had witnessed this, no following whatever was made. It is this sort
of thing in this case, and in a great many others, that has led to
the facetious, but somewhat deadly remark by someone that "Project
Blue Book might be called, not the 'Society for the Investigation
of Unexamined', (Ivan Sancson's organization) but rather, 'Society
for the Explanation of the Uninvestigated'." Since 1947, because
of lack of funds and adequate personnel, a formidable number of
cases were not adequately followed up. I had often pointed out,
both to officials in Dayton and in Washington, that a day of reckoning might some day come when the Air Force might be asked to know
cause why proper investigations were not made. In this case, for
instance, no attempt apparently was made even to find out "the
others" were had made this sighting. How many? Were there other
passengers? Were they members of the crew? No attempt was
made to find out the duration of the sighting. In view of this,
it is patently impossible to form any sort of a valid judgment
to what the stimulus that gave rise to this report might have been.
To list it as "insufficient information" is incorrect, but it should
really be listed as "insufficient information" because of lack of
follow-up. A store of information may have been available, but this
store was never tapped. Incidentally, how is the case presented
carried, unidentified, or insufficient information? The latter
would certainly be more appropriate.

3. 4 June 1952, Stuttgart, Germany.

I have rated this a E3 C6 meaning puzzling but possibly explainable case of credibility 6, since there were two witnesses technically
trained. One witness was a Lieutenant Colonel who was shortly thereafter assigned to the Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters,
United States Air Force. It seems unlikely that they would have
been misled into a misidentification of an F84, and reported instead
a very bright light that crossed in front of their aircraft, made
fairly tight turns, and then have turned their own aircraft to
follow it. Of course, it is entirely possible that it was a gross
misidentification on the part of these two experienced pilots, and
therefore the evaluation of possible aircraft is justified. It
is unjustified, however, in the statistics for the year to call it
an unquestioned aircraft. To be fair, one might also have originated
it "possibly unidentified" and at the end of the year have listed
it as "unidentified". I have long inveighed against the unacceptable (and this is to any good statistician) statistics employed by
Blue Book over the years in transforming "possibles" and "probables"
into firm actualities.
