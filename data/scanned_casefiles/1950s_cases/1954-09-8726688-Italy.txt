UNCLASSIFIED

The following is an extract of a series of UFO sightings observed on dates as noted below. Prepared 11 July - Sep 54.

Austria - 12 Aug 54
Graz, Austria: Circular, disc-like object, about twice as large as Venus. Observed for 2 minutes. ATIC Eval: Possible Balloon.

Finland - 14 Sep 54
Circular flying object over Helsinki at night. Flying at 800 meters (alt), it gave off an intense light and left trail of reddish smoke. Visible for 7 sec. ATIC Eval: Possible meteor.

France - 30 Aug 54 - Paris
A Paris resident observed a luminous circular object flying over the city. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Seine Department - 7 Sep 54
A 27 year old mason and his assistant observed a "flying saucer" at 0715 hrs, 7 Sep 54. The object was grey and was observed hovering over a field about 200 meters from the observers. The object oscillated slowly and seemed to move a closed door on its side. When the man tried rapidly about 50 meters toward it, the object began to fly away. Smoke was then visible from a sort of exhaust pipe on the underside. After an oblique flight of about 15 meters, the object rose vertically and disappeared. No trace of the object was found by police. The object was about 10 meters in diameter and 3 meters in height, did not glow and descended noiselessly, trailing smoke. Visible for about 3 minutes. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN

Algne Department - 7 Sep 54
A luminous red orange disc observed by three persons who saw the disc stopped suddenly 700-800 meters from the ground. It seemed to give on its upper side a small luminous tail forming an inclined part of the object. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Italy - 14 Sep 54
Two inhabitants of Pitigliano report sighting of a round, strange object making a strange, loud noise. The object came to a stand still, then disappeared at high speed. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Rome - 17 Sep 54
On the afternoon of 17 Sep 54, the control tower at Ciampino Air Base observed a mysterious object shaped like a half a cigar slowly at an altitude of 1,200 meters. The object leaving a trail of luminous smoke, was visible for 40 minutes. ATIC Eval: Probable meteorite a/c.

Memorandum - Aug 54
Two flying saucers were two flying saucers over the blue on the
night of 4 August between 1900 and 2400 hours. They moved at incredible
speed, at times remaining motionless for as long as 30 seconds. They were
flat ovals with a grayish gray hue. ATC will: Possible searchlight
power.

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked
increase in UFO sightings throughout Europe. ATC attributes the majority
of these sightings to two basic reasons:
1. The European press has been quick to publish, in detail, UFO
sightings of this phase. It is influencing a great number of persons for
personal publicity.
2. Mr. D. Keyhoe's book was recently translated into various foreign
languages. And was on sale at newsstand throughout Europe during the summer
of 1954.
