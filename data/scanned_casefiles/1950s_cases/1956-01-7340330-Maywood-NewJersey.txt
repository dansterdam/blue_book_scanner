DATE: April 3, 1956

The early morning of Sat. Jan. 21, 1956 - after having completed a round through Chemical Plant where I am employed, as a Guard - The time was 3:30 AM plus - had taken a seat in Gate House and was looking in a westerly direction toward Route 17 NJ.

At this moment - moving in a northerly direction there appeared an object in the sky. Its front was ball shaped and to the rear - several tail like shapes flashed out to the rear of the ball like front.

The front or ball seemed to contain a mass of seething gases. They seemed to be in a great state of agitation. The colors within the ball seemed to change: first green - then blue and finally yellow.

The rear - or the tails were more like a blend of the three colors. Though more or less inactive and much less brilliant than the ball.

Surrounding the main object completely, ball and tails - for what must have been quite a distance, the glow reflected in the sky was extremely noticeable and seemed as though the object was enclosed in a poorly lighted container. It seemed and was oblong in shape.

Apr. 3, 1956.

Dear Lieutenant Elwood-

First, my sincere apologies for a terrible effort in answering the information sheet. As you will see my education has been far from complete.

But - I did try - also, you will note - I am in the "Old Goat" category.

Returning to the start of this whole thing - I repeat it was a most unusual happening and I was deeply impressed.

Thank you for kindness and interest.

* - forgetting words now - and if you ever happen to be in the vicinity of the plant or my home would enjoy seeing you.

May the best of everything be yours and may God bless you.

Respectfully,
[signature redacted]

Hackensack, N.J.
