APPROVED UNDER DATE 14 JULY 1942

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

AGENCY: ALASKA AIR COMMAND

1. SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:
a. Extracts from the "Intelligence of "A-2", AF. This report indicates that at 1730 P.M. on 13 September 1950, the observers, namely: 
2 aircraft pilots of the 57th Fighter Squadron, 58th Fighter Interceptor Wing, ALAS, saw a peculiar object over the Arctic Circle 40 miles south-southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska.

b. Two observers in a C-47 aircraft (25296) while flying from Anchorage to Fairbanks, Alaska (Etar 45-08) they saw what they believe to be "flying discs" about 30 miles south of Kenai, Alaska (Etar 45-08), at 1600 hours, 11 September 1950.

c. An Air Intelligence Officer at Elmendorf AFB stated that it was reported that a rumor circulated that a "flying disc" landed near Clear, Alaska, on 14 September 1950. Upon checking this report, the rumor was not verified and the matter was classified as "unconfirmed."

d. The following is a summary of the sightings mentioned above:
1) The first sighting by the two pilots of the 57th Fighter Squadron, 58th Fighter Interceptor Wing, ALAS, was at 1730 hours on 13 September 1950, 40 miles south-southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. The objects were described as round, appeared to be metallic, and made abrupt changes in course and altitude. They were observed for about 10 minutes.
2) The second sighting by the crew of the C-47 aircraft (25296) was at 1600 hours on 11 September 1950, about 30 miles south of Kenai, Alaska. The observers described the objects as "flying discs" and they were observed for about 5 minutes.
3) The unconfirmed report of a "flying disc" landing near Clear, Alaska, on 14 September 1950, could not be verified.

10. COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
In all cases, the Air Intelligence Officers concerned by that time had investigated the reports and had determined that there was no concrete evidence to indicate the presence of any unconventional aircraft in the area. The reports were therefore classified as "unidentified."

Dear Mr. Valle,
I have just finished reading your interesting book and should like to tell you what I have while serving in the U.S. Navy. My rating was that of Aerographer 3/c (Meteorologist) and during periods of carrier duty, I served at the U.S. Navy Fleet Weather Central. I spent two years of the 31' Light Cruiser, attached to the Staff of Rear Admiral Richard L. Cochrane's group in the South Pacific. Upon discharge from Western reserve U. in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1948. On the 27th of November, 1950 I was recalled to active duty with the U.S. Navy's Fleet Weather Central. The sighting I am about to describe occurred about the middle of December, 1950. I remember that it was just before Christmas - a clear, bright day. The meteorological group at the Weather Central decided to make a pilot balloon launching to gather wind aloft data. I was detailed to handle the theodolite, while two other assistants handled the balloon. The day was perfect - warm, no cloud cover and calm - I believe the time was early afternoon. We normally charted data on the balloon drift. On this day, when the balloon had reached approximately 12,000 feet altitude, the theodolite operator called my attention to what he described as a round metallic object pacing the balloon at what appeared to be around 20,000 feet. The object was without vapor trail and appeared to be motionless relative to the balloon. I observed this phenomenon for some 15-20 minutes until the balloon passed out of sight. I can state with certainty that the object was metallic, round, and without visible means of propulsion. Unfortunately, we did not have any cameras or other photographic equipment available with which to record this sighting. I hope this information will be of interest to you.
Sincerely,
[Signature]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a report or document related to a Project Blue Book UFO incident in South Central Alaska on November 9, 1950. The text describes the sighting of multiple objects that were moving at a high speed and in a northwesterly direction from the air station, and the subsequent investigation by military personnel.

Transcribed text from the document:

I received all the readings necessary, when I was about some place in South Central Alaska, did not think anything of it but as I watched number of these things rapidly passing by and I watched to see these things he didn't maneuver to speak of. Some of them merely seemed to come on over to win. He also saw them - in order to judge the catch grass which at the threshold on one point the they had to be turned quite rapidly in order to follow their base. they were moving in a northwesterly direction from the air station, and immediately picked up a number of these objects travelling together as if in formation. There would be groups of three or four and even single objects travelling at a very high speed as in order to follow the threshold had to be turned quite rapidly to its base. reported our discovery and Chief was called in (later he made a Chief Warrant) came up and upon taking the glass immediately sighted - his report like our statement based on with the pair of binoculars brought down from the traffic control tower. As to their appearance, they had a greenish-white and were tear-drop shaped. If you were to cot on airplane wing, the cross-cut would be very close to their appearance.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document describing a reported UFO sighting.

The full text from the document is as follows:

"The arrows of course indicates the direction of their travel, but the 'jets' seemed to wave about but did not become any longer in size - it did not look like a jet trail as it the arrow no longer. They seemed to be returning, i.e. coming towards the sea coast, and then very suddenly making a 90 turn at high speed and disappearing - leaving no trail in the sky at all. I believe they kept reappearing as if they were on a circular course around the hill or mountain range.

The Navy pilots saw them apparently also. Traffic Control Towers, the materially etc. either from NAMS Holtvile, Texas brought this to my attention, a man in California was 'Craft' with some 20 passengers aboard, that took off from the Churchchin Reservoir in Korea. Our Commanding Officer, Commander , the Captain, watched them all almost that same afternoon when this was reported to us. It was later that our base radar had these effects and that our information on the speed of what we sighted was ascertained.

After about 45 minutes it was watching it appear and disappear from view at the top of the tree-line. It had a metallic glare - that is it had a gray, rather fluffy appearance - it did not appear to be solid at all, but looked as if a gray gas was building up with a metallic content to it, and suddenly it would disappear. The objects were much larger than any we know of today. The objects could be sighted and then suddenly disappear which would indicate some form of 'cloaking' or protective device. We continued to observe them several days afterwards but I have had many reports regarding this incident from the people involved who were career Navy personnel and I suppose many have been left as it happened 15 yrs. ago."

Service is continuing. Their would be difficult to service them property must be some way in this matter how this object may have landed I believe retired and living in San Diego. I saw it with intense electrical effects. There is no evidence that this was a hoax. So I do not know what we saw that day. They...were...real and tangible. Good luck on your investigation. Very truly yours. Van Dung, California.

Unusual big lights appeared at 1948 lt US air tractor 99. These lights apparently hovered at about 10.000 ft for 30 mins. They were brighter and larger than any known aircraft. When tractor pilot attempted rendezvous, lights immediately took off and disappeared at terrific speed, 1.e. out of sight in 2-3 mlns. When lights disappeared, tractor pilot observed that several aircraft which had been in the vicinity had also disappeared. As soon as lights disappeared, tractor pilot reported incident to Richardson Army Air Field tower. Tower confirmed observation of lights. Aircraft from Richardson airfleld were immediately scrambled to investigate but no contact was made. Incident caused considerable local interest and excitement due to meteor.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. IP-2650
DATE 7 DEC 1950
PAGE 1 OF 3 PAGES

The following is a final report regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object which occurred on 6 November 1950 in the general area of South Central Alaska.

Extract from the weather log of the Alaska Air Command states: "At 1402 G local the sky near Adak was obscured by an unidentified object silhouetted against the sky. It was approximately twice the size of a B-29 and appeared to be hovering over the area. Observation time approximately 4 minutes. The object then accelerated at terrific speed and disappeared over the horizon." 

Extract from the Flight Control Log of the Civil Aeronautics Administration states: "At 1404 G local an unidentified aircraft was observed over the area of Adak traveling at a high rate of speed and at high altitude. The object was heading North and was not responding to any control attempts. No air traffic was scheduled in that area at that time."

The pilot of a P-51 Mustang fighter on a routine training flight over the Adak area at the time of the sighting reported seeing the object, describing it as a "circular, metallic appearing craft, approximately twice the size of a B-29 which appeared to hover momentarily and then accelerate at a terrific rate of speed and disappear from sight." The pilot stated that the object was unlike any aircraft he was familiar with.

No other reports from this incident could be obtained. Based on the above facts, the following evaluations are made:

1. The object was observed by at least two reliable sources, the Alaska Air Command weather observer and the pilot of the P-51 Mustang.
2. The object possessed characteristics of performance and maneuverability that are beyond the capabilities of any known type of aircraft.
3. The object was not responding to any air traffic control.
