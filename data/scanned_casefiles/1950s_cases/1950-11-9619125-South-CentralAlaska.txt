    Observer locked up and saw a blue-white meteorite traveling about NW by N from the SE. It was just a flash. He would judge about five miles up. About thirty seconds later he heard an explosion overhead where he saw the meteorite. Then he heard the second, third and fourth and fifth explosions in rapid succession, each one a little further away. The last one was very faint and far away. All explosions were almost overhead and a little to South.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM Elmendorf AFB                     REPORT NO.     TR-50-50                     PAGE    1    OF    2    PAGES

6. 4 telegram received from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Alaska, in 14-
catal no 4 of 4 returns on their most northerly meteorographs.

7. a. AT ELMENDORF AFB, ALASKA THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS NOTED:

    a. At approximately 1950 an officer on duty with the 5258th ACW Sq reported
that he saw a flash of light through a window of the building where he was located,
in than -covered outside and heard a rumbling noise not over two to three (2-3) minutes
later. Course was unable to determine whether the direction, of the flash and further
stated that nothing was picked up on their radar screen.

    b. Two meteorators on a C-54 aircraft (A/C 0260) while flying from Anchorage
Washintgon, to Clearfield AFS, stated that at 1/8600, while above 10,000 west of
Talkeetna, Alaska, (680 40' - 1500 50'E) they saw what appeared to be a green flare about
twenty (20) miles ahead and about ten thousand (10,000) feet altitude, which went
into yellow. No turbulence was felt and no noise was heard.

    c. An Air Transport at Elmendorf AFB stated that at approximately 900 hours
he saw a flash of light which was very high in the air. To thread - of Anchorage, he
further stated that he then heard a low rumble from a southerly direction.

8. The following is one of the most comprehensive eye-witness accounts of the
incident. "On the evening of 15 Nov 1950, I was on duty 1st Lt. Van Etten, 5258th
air base group, at Elmendorf AFB. At approximately 1950 hours, I observed a bright
white flash, similar to a photographer's flash bulb, which lit up the entire sky
west of Anchorage, Alaska. The flash lasted about thirty seconds. I was engaged
in plotting charts, and at the moment of the flash I was looking northwest. The
little further away. The last note was very faint and quite far from the observer.
All explosion were approximately at 1115 to the south."

9. A special event with the CSI reported that at 1950 he saw a weird light,
very brilliant, resembling that seen off by an acetylene torch, which completely
illuminated Fire Island, Alaska. (610 06'N - 1500 15'W) The light was similar to
the sky from forth to South in much the same manner as a meteor: it disappeared
approximately shortly (30) seconds.

10. COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

The source concerned in this report are considered to be reliable individuals.
In all probability the incident mentioned in this report was caused by a meteor or
meteoroid traveling through space, which, when its encountered the earth's atmosphere,
was heated to luminosity.

Dear Mr. Valle                                        August 10, 1965

I have just finished reading your interesting book regarding UFO's entitled "Anatomy of A Phenomenon" and should like to tell you of an experience which I had while serving in the U.S. Navy. My rating was that of Aerographer 3/c (meteorologist) and during WWII served aboard the U.S.S. Santa Fe (CL-60) light cruiser, attached to the Staff of Rear Admiral Richard Diyo. I spent two years of the 3 1/2 I served in the South Pacific. Upon my discharge I completed my college and received my degree from Western Reserve U. in Cleveland, Ohio in 1948. On the 27th of November, 1950 I was recalled to active duty, and sent to NAS North Island (San Diego), Calif. for duty at the Navy Fleet Weather Central. The sighting I am about to describe occurred about the middle of December, 1950 - I remember that it was just a few days before Christmas. Myself and another Aerographer named [redacted] went to the top of the Weather Central to make a pilot balloon launching to gather winds aloft data. I was operating the theodolite, while [redacted] launched the balloon and recorded the readings which I called to him each minute. The day was perfect. Warm, no cloud cover and calm - I believe the time was early afternoon. We normally charted data on the balloon til it reached approx. 1,000 feet & then stopped our readings - we had almost

did not think anything of it but as I watched a
number of these things rapidly passed by and I
minated to [redacted] about seeing something; he didn't
here we and when I saw more of them, turned the
ass over to him. He also saw them - in order to
w them, we had to disengage the ratchet gears which
f the theodolite on one point, thereby freeing it to turn
idly. I sighted out over Point Loma, which is in
eral Northwesterly direction from the air station, and
mediately picked up a number of these objects
elling together as if in formation. There would be
ups of three or four, a pair and even single
s, all following the same course - they appeared to be
elling at a very high speed, as in order to follow
m the theodolite had to be turned quite rapidly
its base. [redacted] reported our discovery via the
cream to those below but no one would believe us.
ally our watch chief, Chief [redacted] (later he
s made a Chief Warrant) came up and upon taking
r the glass immediately sighted them - his report
ight everyone up on the roof. The objects were not
ble with the naked eye, nor even with a pair of
ulars brought down from the traffic control tower.

As to their appearance, they had a grayish, white
r and were tear-drop shaped. If you were to cut
ugh an airplane wing, the cross-cut would be very
se to their appearance.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

The arrow of course, indicates the direction of their travels. at the rear end there was a Cottony- looking tail which seemed to wave about but did not become any longer in size- it did not look like a Jet trail as it grew no longer. They were travelling in a North to South direction, seemingly running parallel with the sea coast, & then very suddenly making a 90 turn at high and disappearing from view heading toward the ocean toward the west). There were groups of them and I believe they kept reaffirming, as if they were on a circular course around and around. We had as many as 30 people watching them, including Navy pilots, aerographers, traffic control operators, the meteorology officer from NAAS-Holtville plus number of U.S. Air Force pilots who were using our field bringing in Marine first-bite cases from the Chunychin Reservoir then in Korea. Our Commanding officer, Commander [redacted], her Captain), watched them for almost the entire time we served them, which was for about an hour and 1/2. I was told later that our base radar had these objects and they were over 100,000 feet. Cmdr. [redacted] sighted one which was not moving- we all had a chance to look at it and a few minutes later while [redacted] was watching it, he said there was a sudden white puff from its base and it shot out view at the top of the eyepiece - he said it looked as if someone had dropped a large bag of flour out of the sun" and then it was gone. The stationary one did not have a metallic appearance- it had a gray-white, rather fluffy appearance but did appear to be solid - I could not be able to estimate the size of these objects but would guess were quite large. The objects very suddenly stopped appearing- we watched for a long while after they departed - we looked many days afterward but saw nothing. We wrote complete rpts for the Navy but I never heard anything more regarding these objects. I felt you might find this of interest- many of the people involved were career Navy personnel and because this happened 15 yrs ago. I suppose many have now left

UNUSUAL CELESTIAL OBSERVATION - POSSIBLE METEOR, SIGHTED AT MERRILL FIELD, ALASKA

The following report is a compilation of information from various sources re: an unusual celestial observation - specifically a meteor, on 30 November 1950, in South-Central Alaska.

Extract from the weather log of the United States Weather Bureau, Merrill Field, Anchorage, Alaska; entered by the weather observer on 30 November 1950 at 8:15 nights:

"Observed bright blue flash in sky at 7:55 P" accompanied by a thunder which lasted about two (2) or three (3) minutes. Distinctly noted from 300 degrees."

Extract from the Flight Control Log of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, Merrill Field, Anchorage, Alaska; entered by the Merrill Field Control Tower on duty at the time of the incident:

"Saw white flash, very bright lightning strikes area at 7:55 PM. PS-2, 50.3, GM 0255 observed strong, arched lightning to be noticed. Attached close to horizon, conditions at Merrill Field, also several persons reported having seen it. Pointing in Anchorage." (NOTES: PS-2, 50.3, OKI 0525, position of aircraft approaching Anchorage at the time...)

On 1 December 1950, the following information was received from Civil Aeronautics, Merrill Field, Anchorage, Alaska:

"Unusual light was seen approximately 30-50°N low by 2 miles distant, 10-20 miles South of Kodiak, and by a USN vessel 15 to 20 miles South of Kodiak. Lights Green (30°) miles South of Kodiak. Light Green to white."

A Civil Aeronautics Administration Engineer, on duty at the incident, examined the incident and reported as follows: "Within moments appeared to be completely over Southwestern division, Anchorage. Lasted about 2 or 3 seconds at approximately 7:55 PM. Immediately after the flash there was a sequence of rumbling sounds overhead, which I thought to be caused by Air Force maneuvers or the like."

A telegram received from the University of Alaska indicated no signs of disturbance on their most sensitive seismographs.

The following is one of the most comprehensive eye-witness accounts of the sighting. The person writing the statement was about four miles from Anchorage, Alaska, and there were no other witnesses:

"On the evening of November 30, 1950, at 7:50 PM, the sky lit up almost as bright as day. I looked up and saw a blue-white trajectory. Traveling about five miles from the Southeast. It was just a flash. I would judge about five miles long. I saw the second, third and fourth and fifth explosions in rapid succession, each one a little brighter and more vivid than the last. All explosions were almost overhead and a little to the south. I live on a homestead about four miles south of Anchorage and then saw this light on rising ground from my hand observation."

A reporter on the staff of a local newspaper in Anchorage, Alaska was on the street at the time of the incident and described "apparent" lightning and thunder. All persons who had been outside indicated that there was a very large flash of light. Lasting perhaps 2 to 3 seconds, people interviewed by the newspaper indicated they heard the subsequent explosion. People interviewed thought it might be firing of photo-flash for aerial photo taking or possibly a very sort of aerial explosion.

Unwnhosis-dtg 0100SF PGs from AFOIN-E/C I Hull. At approx
010559 the entire AF lights were suddenly illuminated by a
BRITISH blue white light which rapidly increased in intensity
most to daylight intensity before it disappeared at high in sky.
Mountains were approx 70 miles at distance of 70 miles. The
light flash was observed for only a few seconds by hundreds of
witnesses including 3.0 and 3.06 and for a few times. The flash was
followed in a few seconds by a rumbling noise. The light was
reported observed from Kodiak and as far north as Holy (185 miles north of Anchorage).

It was not observed at Naknek. Recon contact was negative.
Varying descriptions of the sighted object causing the flash, its
direction of travel and the exact noise have been received.
Samples are as follows:

1. Official weather report noted that a bright blue
flash accompanied by a loud rumbling like thunder swept the sky.

2. It traveled on the sky quite high and a little to
the south. It resembled a fire traveling East to West and in a
second or two crossed about 15 degrees of the sky, then went out
like a match. It traveled in a flat trajectory curving downward.

3. I saw a blue lights from a flat travelling north northwest.
Thirty seconds later I heard an explosion, then a second, third,
fourth, and fifth which were subsequently faintness.

4. Suddenly there was a blinding flash and the whole sky
lighted up, following by a great rumbling crash.

5. It looked like the sort of fire that might result if
a transformer exploded only brighter and was followed in ten or
twelve seconds by a low rumble like distant thunder.

6. A photo exposing Anchorage from the south said the
object appeared directly overhead increasing in brilliancy until
it was blinding to look at then seemed to explode northeast of the
plane. The object left a trail and was visible only 20 to
30 seconds.

The following is a final report regarding the sighting of an unusual celestial object, probably a meteor, in the Central Alaska at approximately 1955 hours, 30 November 1950.

1. Extract from the weather log of the "Ladd Field," Anchorage, Alaska (60°-17'N - 147°-43'W) enters: "By this weather observer on duty at the time of the incident, 'Observed what appeared to be accompanied by loud metallic-like noise to thunder which lasted about two (2) or three (3) minutes. Solidity rather large motorcycle struck north not too distant."

2. Extract from the Flight Control Log of the Civil Aeronautics Administration Air Traffic Control Tower, Merrill Field, Anchorage, Alaska entered by the Senior Air Traffic Controller, Merrill Field Control Tower on duty at the time of the incident: "At approximately 1955, while listening to KFQD radio, observed a bright flash of light in the sky. CA 25, PK 30, PC 25, WS 5. Observed same, advised believed to be meteor. Flash also seen by most Merrill Field personnel."

3. On 1 December 1950, the following information was received from the G-2 Intelligence Officer, 17th General Depot, Kodiak, Alaska: "A signal intelligence report, 17th Gen Depot, Kodiak, Alaska (CG-17 Gen Depot) was sighted by the local communications personnel at Kodiak, (CG-17) at approximately 1920 hours. The light was sighted by the local personnel at Kodiak, (CG-17) at approximately 1920 hours. The light was sighted at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet, and the duration of the sighting which was at 1900 hours, was not more than a fleeting of time."

4. A Civil Aeronautics Administration Engineer, off duty at his residence in Anchorage, Alaska, witnessed the incident and reported: "About 1955 hours, a bright light appeared in the northwest sky. The object seemed to be coming from a northwesterly direction, lasting about 2 or 3 seconds. Immediately after the object disappeared, a loud noise was heard, which I thought to be caused by its passage through the air."

5. In the "Moe" (average Commissary, AK, Merrill Field) arrived that at approximately 1900 hours, 30 Nov 1950, he was driving his car west in Anchorage, and his attention was drawn to a bright flash in the sky overhead which till line-of-sight was clear. He stated that he had a clear view of the sky and the flash (approximately twenty (20) to thirty (30) seconds). The source noted that he immediately looks us into the sky but could not determine the source from which the flash came. The CAA controller's tower reported a message received from CAA communicator at Talkeetna, Alaska (60°-N, 153°-26'W) which is quoted verbatim below:

"Two Talkeetna, Alaska tower DIONOSC* to Anchorage (AK-forward) following to Air Defense Control Center (ADC-Elmendorf Air Force Base). Two closely spaced brilliant flashes of blue light were seen over the town of Talkeetna, simultaneously about 8:27. A highway patrolman driving along road 12 N. North of Talkeetna reports that a similar phenomenon lit up the area as if it were daylight for about two seconds. No explosion reported."
