Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars".

Orion: Season's Finest
This is Juno, the winter's finest month, and Orion is now rising in the east about 9 p.m. and will be visible throughout the night. Its belt of three stars is easily recognized...

Bright Birds in the Sky
[Some text in this section is illegible]

At the bottom of the page, there are two star charts labeled "Symbols for Stars in Order of Brightness" showing constellations and their positions in the sky, with labels like Aquila, Hercules, Ursa Major, Gemini, Pisces, Phoenix, and others.

The document appears to be an astronomical guide discussing Venus, the Leonid meteor shower, and the constellation Orion.
