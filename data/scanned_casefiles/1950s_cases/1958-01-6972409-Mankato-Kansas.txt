Gentlemen:

After spending the night of January 3rd at the Sleepy Hollow
Motel in Mankato, Kansas, my wife and I motored east on
Highway 36.

I started out with the headlights on but switched to the park-
ing lights after a few miles. We were driving at approximately
60 miles per hour when my wife said, ”What is that?” and
motioned to the right.

To say I was surprised at what I saw would be an understatement.
At about 45 degrees to the right and at a distance I thought
to be less than a mile there was an airplane and a large one.
Possibly a street cruiser. It appeared to be in flight not
far above the horizon, and I was afraid it would land before
we got to a point where we could take a good picture, and we
drove possibly 3/ 4 of a mile before stopping on top of a low
hill.

What was so astounding about this plane was its appearance.
It was entirely a luminous red in color and the outline of
its form was clear. Extending above the cockpit to a dis-
tance equal to that from the cockpit to the nose of the
plane was an aerial with a white light at the top. The aerial
was not red or luminous but its form was clearly outlined.

When we stopped we could see that the plane was not flying
but was stationary above the horizon.

Between the point where we first saw the plane and where we
stopped my wife had been adjusting the camera for a picture.
As we stopped she lowered the window and got the target
centered when she said, "I've got this adjusted for a moving
object so I'd better readjust it."

While she was doing this I saw that another aerial extended
up half way from the cockpit to the tail but was not lighted
at its tip.

Before she could get her camera focused again I saw that the
nose of the plane was disappearing and told her to hurry or
she would be too late to get a picture. She looked and
raised the camera but didn't take the picture as the plane
was disappearing in an irregular line and continued to do
so back through the cockpit and finally through the tail
until all that was left was the white light of the aerial
which showed for a few moments and then was gone.

The sky was clouded in that direction and only two lines of
light from the sun could be seen after the plane disappeared.
One was in line with the spot where the plane had been and
the other farther above the horizon.

The time lapse from when we first sighted it until it dis-
appeared was several minutes, possibly five.

What was this phenomenon?

What caused it?

Are there planes in existence which have aerials similar to
the ones mentioned?

If what we saw was the image of a plane where was the original
located?

Have you received any reports from others who saw this object?

Thank you for any information.

                Respectfully,
```

SAFITS-3/Maj. Tacker/jmd/74996/2/2Feb 58

24 February 1958

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your
letter of 20 January 1958 addressed to Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base, Ohio, concerning an unidentified flying
object.

The object you observed was probably one of the
new radar-search aircraft designated WR-2. This aircraft
has the same general configuration of a strato-cruiser,
as mentioned in your letter.

For your information illustrations of this type
aircraft are inclosed, together with latest Department
of Defense Fact Sheet on this subject, dated 5 November
1957.

Thank you again for your interest in this subject.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
