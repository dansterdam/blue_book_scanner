AIR INTELLIGENCE CLASSIFICATION REPORT

Div/Int, NEAC                                                   DT-15-52        2   of   3

1. Description of object sighted:
Number: 1.
Shape: round.
Size: approximately the size of a man hole cover.
Color: Yellowish gold.
Speed: High rate of speed.
Maneuverability: rapid rate of climb. Sharp turn.
Sound: none.
Exhaust trail: none.

Characteristics: Enroute home from a picture show Mr. [redacted] noticed a bright spot about 2,000 feet up in the space which was hanging over the Rooster paper mill and appeared to watch. The spot, which appeared as a high blob of light about the size of a man hole cover, remained stationary for about one minute then with a slight wobbling motion moved up and to the left at a rapid rate. The object emerged from the smoke at an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 feet where it paused momentarily and appeared to be stationary. From this position it moved out of sight toward the east at a high rate of speed.

Three minutes after Mr. [redacted] had remarked that walk a bright object appeared in the east resembling a dot, moving toward the west and increasing in size. As a rough observer at an estimated altitude of 11,000 feet, the object seemed to make a coordinated vertical turning turn of 1800 to the left and moved out of sight toward the east.

2. Time of sighting: 2210 Local 18 April 1952. Duration of one to one and one-half minutes (1-1½).

3. Manner of observation: visual from a ground position.

4. Location of observer: Mr. [redacted] was on a city street in Corner Brook, Newfoundland (45°57'N 57°57'W).

5. Information concerning the observer:
Name: [redacted]
Age: 32 years
Occupation: [redacted] "The Western Star" newspaper.
Address: [redacted] Corner Brook, Newfoundland.
Previous experience: RCAF pilot for 4½ years.
Reliability: appears to be intelligent, reliable and of an impressive nature.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS.
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

6. Weather: clear, slight wind from the west.

7. Meteorological conditions: none noted which would have a bearing on this incident.

8. Physical evidence: none.

9. Intercept or identification action: none.

CONTENTS by Information Source:

"Flying Saucers" were already in the news when Mr. [redacted] saw the object which he reported. He was aware of Mr. [redacted] sighting (TR-LA-52), and that other sightings had been reported in Canada during the few days preceding this incident. On the day of his sighting he had published an article calling the "flying saucers". (A copy of the article is attached to this report.)

In the draft copy of an article which Mr. [redacted] prepared for publication in the April 22nd edition of "The Western Star", he had claimed in a slow spiral 3,000 feet or more in height. This may or may not be corroborated by him the same as a "slight wobbling motion".

Now that Time magazine and Ed Fern have revived the Flying Saucer issue, there appears to be no further need for [redacted] to adhere to his self-imposed security ban.

The truth of the matter is, I have intercepted radio messages from the occupant of the airplane overhead, and with the help of a young neighbor who kindly lent me his space dictionary, I have managed to decode at least one message.

This particular message had to do with a popular song which I believe is called "How deep is the ocean" and from the Martian's report (they are funny, you know) it appears that they are studying us intensely.

It is also evident that they are a race of intelligence battles because one of them concluded a reason why they are here is to get this straight before you attempt to explain it to the Big Egg."

Anyway, here is the message just as intercepted, and the reader can draw his own conclusions. It was addressed to the Chief of the FBI which I presume means Martian Bureau of Investigation.

Dear Chiefs:

Following is an Earth message intercepted by us. It was delivered in the form of a chant, and may well be some sort of cumulative report which at sentence by sentence along with the comments of our own psychologist:

How deep is the ocean?
(Psychologist's comment - Obviously these beings are of a very primitive order and know very little of the world they live in. Here they are speculating about the depth of the liquid which covers a good portion of their planet.)

How high is the sky?
("Psych. comment - Here again their ignorance is appalling. They appear to mistake the layers of dust in the air that diffuse the light of their sun for a fixed canopy which they call "sky".)

How much do I love you?
(Psych. comment - Apparently this is in reference to some basic emotion which seems to be constantly plaguing the entire species, an attempt to come to some definite conclusion as to the exact nature of the emotion and its cause has so far led to complete failure.)

(In some of the species it appears to be the cause of great unhappiness while in others it leads to complete apathy. Some appear to be peacefully inclined while in others the symptoms are the exact opposites. One race knows no love foundation for this statement. In fact, our observers report that it is believed to have existed on an all part of the planet and to have conflicting theories on the limited intelligence of the species begun.)

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Dir/Int, MAC                                     18-15-52                     PAGE 2     OF 2

The remainder of the chant seemed to be composed of equally inane queries that tend to confuse the rational behavioral or the mathematical world. A view of this, our scientists deemed it advisable to concentrate on trying to find some logical explanation for the irrational behavior of the species while under the influence of this much vaunted emotion.

Accordingly, we assembled all known data on the subject and fed it into our most intricate analysis, with the result that, "What is love?" The computer, which has been known to solve some of our most complex equations in a matter of seconds, blew up after many long hours.

In view of this, we have come to the conclusion that the mention referred to is some sort of mental hex on which these beings have stumbled on, which would surely prove fatal to a more advanced civilization such as ours.

We respectfully suggest that all plans for conquering this barbaric planet be abandoned, and our exploratory expedition be permitted to return to base at once.

... That, I believe, takes care of the Flying Saucer menace once and for all, so now let's hear no more of the darn nonsense.
