UNCLASSIFIED

25 April 1950

TO : Commanding General
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: MOI

1. In compliance with letter, Department of the Army, OGUSA, OSIRD 452.1, dated 25 March 1948, subject: Unconventional Aircraft, control number A-1927, the following information received from the Fifth Army Regional Office, Indianapolis, Indiana, is forwarded.

"On 12 April 1950, an agent interviewed Mr. [redacted], fabricator with the Continental Steel Corporation, 1200 West Markland, Kokomo, Indiana. Informant stated that, upon being awakened by his dog at 0200, 8 April 1950, he saw an 'object' about two hundred feet in the air, almost directly overhead. This 'object' was a grayish metal disc approximately fifteen feet in diameter and fifty feet in circumference, shaped approximately like a child's toy top.

On the top bulge of the 'object', he saw a small coming tower as the whole thing tilted occasionally. The 'object' rotated slowly on its perpendicular axis, and informant saw three small port holes on the outer rim. These port holes showed a blue-white light from within. After hovering for approximately two minutes the 'object' rose soundly and without tilting moved away to the north at a speed approximating that of a conventional type of aircraft at take-off.

Informant could furnish no further information as to size or appearance of the apparatus."

2. Since the referenced letter is more than two years old this office desires to know if continued compliance is still requested.

FOR THE COMMANDING GENERAL,
