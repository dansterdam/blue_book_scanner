Two objects round, size of half dollar, color cream to white. Objects side by side, appeared as hazy ball. WX balloons and numerous a/c in area. Indistinct in shape, very bright.

11. COMMENTS
Preparing officer comment that WX balloon was released at 1500 hrs and very easily could be in area of sighting. Description is similar to cluster balloon; however, duration of 3-5 secs tends to conflict with this analysis. Description of motion is in accord w/balloon analysis. Case listed as possible balloon.

AN AIR NATIONAL GUARD T-33 AIRCRAFT PURSUING TO KEESLER AIR FORCE BASE CHANGED ITS FLIGHT PLAN TO GULFPORT CIVIL AIRPORT AT 16.52 F AND LANDED AT 16.72 F. NUMEROUS JET AND CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT WERE IN THE AREA DUE TO AIR NATIONAL GUARD OPERATIONS AT THE GULFPORT FIELD.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT INVESTIGATOR, WING OPERATIONS, THE PILOT OF THE T-33 THAT LANDED AT GULFPORT AT 16.52 WAS QUERIED BY FLIGHT SERVICE AND IS REPORTED NO UNUSUAL SIGHTING OR INCIDENT. THE NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA WEATHER BUREAU RELEASED A WEATHER BALLOON (CROWN COLORED) AT 16.5 F WHICH COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN IN THE AREA OF THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING. IF A JET MADE A PASS AT THE WEATHER BALLOON THE SPEED OF THE JET IN RELATION TO THE BALLOON, THE ANGLE OF OBSERVATION.

LIGHT REFLECTIONS FROM THE BALLOON COULD EXPLAIN THE SIGHTING.

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

The rest of the document appears to be very faint or illegible. There are some vertical lines on the right side of the page, but no other clear text is discernible.
