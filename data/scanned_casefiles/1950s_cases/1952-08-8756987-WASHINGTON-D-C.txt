SECTION E

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this?
(Circle One): Yes or No

26.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? I do not know. If it traveled at wind velocity of 10 mph for 45 seconds, it went here about 510 feet above ground, and might have recognized it, but it didn't look like any weather balloon or toy balloon.

28. Give the following information about yourself:

NAME [Redacted]
Last Name                First Name    Middle Name

ADDRESS

TELEPHONE NUMBER [Redacted]

What is your present job? Mechanical Engineer

Age    44

Sex    Male

29. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?
(Circle One): Yes or No

29.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too?
(Circle One): Yes or No

29.2 Please list their names and addresses:

IN SKY OVER WASHINGTON D.C.

Time: 21 August 1952, 2:50 P.M. EDT

Place: Southeast section of Washington D.C.

Visibility: Sunny, clear, cloudless, Weather Bureau report: wind 4-8 mph, from northwest, 16 miles to west per hour at 1000 feet elevation

Description of sighting: Object was first sighted at Delaware and Nichols Avenue. Color was white, size about 1/2 inch diameter at arm's length, shape somewhat round, no distinct outline, sharp. Moved in a southwesterly direction, traveling at varying speeds, sometimes hovering, sometimes moving rapidly.

Object was white in color with no particular shape. No change in color or shape during entire observation time. No exhaust vapor trail, no sound. Motions were described as somewhat erratic.

At no time during observation did the object appear to be attached to anything visible.

A number of other published cases listed as "Unknown" were in all probability balloons. Since a probability, however good, is not the same as an established fact, these sightings remain in the Unknown category even though their actual explanation is reasonably certain. Such a case was that near Hermanas, New Mexico, which, like that a few weeks earlier at Hamilton Air Force Base, may have abeen stimulated by the 1952 saucer panic in Washington (Chapter vn).

On August 24, 1952, an Air Force colonel was flying from California to Georgia in an F-84-C plane at an air speed of about 290 miles an hour. At 10:15 (A.M. M.S.T.), when near Hermanas, New Mexico, he observed two round, silvery objects about six feet in diameter some two miles north of him and traveling east at high speed; they showed no trail or exhaust. During the three minutes they were in view, one object suddenly began a right turn while the second accelerated rapidly; they changed in shape and in color, became elongated and gray, and then disappeared. A few minutes later over El Paso, Texas, he saw two similar silvery objects, also traveling east. During the ten minutes they were in view, one object seemed to climb straight up for 2000 or 2500 feet, followed immediately by the second one. Assuming that the same pair of objects was involved in both sightings, the observer concluded that they were going much faster than any plane, and reported the incident to ATIC.

The behavior described is typical of that of balloons. Rising into a new wind stream, they may move rapidly and change their orientation so that they look sausage-shaped instead of round; reflecting the sun at a different angle, they look gray rather than silver. Investigators checked with Biggs Air Force Base, White Sands, and El Paso International Airport, both White Sands and El Paso, had released weather balloons at 8:00 that morning which had traveled southeast and burst some time before the sighting at Hermanas. Since no single recorded balloon could account for the sighting, it was listed as Unknown [2].

This inquiry can scarcely be called thorough. Apparently no check was made at Holloman Air Force Base or at more distant bases whose weather balloons might well have tracked into the area. The investigators apparently accepted the pilot's assumption that the objects in the two sightings were identical and were therefore traveling at incredible speeds; yet there was no evidence to support the assumption. It is far more probable that he was observing, two sets of objects, not one. The estimates of size, distance, and speed are all uncertain because no fixed reference point existed. The report does not state whether the objects seemed to be above or below the plane, and it gives no clear heading of the objects.

The objects looked and behaved like balloons. Another possibility is that they were fragments from the balloons that had burst earlier; the observer was looking into the sun and could have misinterpreted what he saw. But the explanation of this incident remains unknown because too few facts were determined.
