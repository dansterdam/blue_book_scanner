ARR 3, 97 APRIL 1952                    Intelligence

On 16 July 1953, the Pomona filter center received a call from a man in Atlantic City, Atlantic City, Atlantic City, who stated that he had observed a strange object in the sky. The observer was interviewed by telephone and gave the following information:

At approximately 1630 hours, while observing objects coming out of the clouds, with a vapor trail behind them. These objects were moving at a terrific speed and were very erratic. Everyone who saw these objects, everyone concluded that they were flying saucers. These flying saucers came out of the clouds and were not a thin and wispy type. No vapor trail was seen. At 1645, a report was passed and this information went word for word to Calleo, where the information was received by 1/Lt Thomas A. Bates, AF 1177 1315, at CG 56.

These saucers were also reported to the Pomona Naval Air Station at Pomona by Paul Leary, reporter for the Atlantic City Press. He gave the same information as he gave me. I received a call from Charles Shields in Atlantic City.

The last we got of these objects was at 1623 at 0056 & heading north. This track was 4 200, along unknown, high altitude. Alice had interceptors in this area and rerouted them to this location but the pilots reported at 0167 & that they had not seen anything unusual in the area. We received nothing else on this track.
