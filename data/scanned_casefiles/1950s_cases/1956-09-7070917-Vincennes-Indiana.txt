Most of the body text is partially illegible due to image quality, with only fragments of text visible. Some words and partial lines can be seen, but not enough to confidently reconstruct full sentences.

The document appears to be an official report or communication, likely related to a UFO sighting or investigation, dated 18 September 1958.
