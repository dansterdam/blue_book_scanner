Dear Sir,

Received your letter and forms of this date. I notice you thank me for reporting sighting - I mailed three sketches of three sightings with a note about others - I hope you received all of them. In any case - copies are on hand - will be glad to forward same - but my job will be a little easier if you would kindly forward forms necessary to give detail, these forms make it very much easier to complete the picture.

Certainly happy to know where to forward data - it certainly was a busy day when this affair began to your information on hand paper of parties.

Thanks to you this - and I hope to be of a little help some where along the line -

Yours Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

a thing as a flying saucer then we are seeing one
held it - in view by sighting back - as by this time
it could directly overhead and headed north - (after from
from east) called to wife to help it in view as it was
passing over garage and I did not want to lose one
second of sighting. I watched it go below garage
roof line + dashed down to where my son-in-law was stand-
ing - too late - wife said just plain rattled.

I immediately questioned wife as to sound and her
observation - nothing outstanding - no noise - no sound
of any kind - no lights - no glow - no nothing but
while we compared sighting we heard up constant
look out - for maybe a return - NONE - about five
to six minutes later - I asked - what in strange is
that cloth - she said - I was about to ask same thing
we checked alley + looked for smoke - none - just
an awful stink - it remained about - 20 minutes.
we both agreed the colour was smoky gray or done
gray - object was SOLID. I made rough sketch + notes
right away. after making sketch did everything possible
to figure out what it was - allowing for just about
everything - nothing seemed to explain that which we
had seen. The time was noted on observation + 
immediately afterward - this was due to other sighting
of which we had been not to ask on - it was due to
three other sightings that I purchased the binoculars
and have since exchanged them for 16x50 from 10x50.

Aug 20th 1956.

Dear Major Graham.

My best wishes for your good health.
You will recall my phone conversation
regarding a central point for forwarding
UFO information.

Enclosed are three sketches (Rough) on the
matter. I have other on hand - but forward
ing only those which were observed through
10 x 50 night glasses. Have other sightings
also that were not sketched due to my
not realizing that others were to follow.
I hope I have not wasted your time, and
that these may be of some interest to
those at Hamilton Field.

Thanking you for your help & consideration.

Yours truly -
