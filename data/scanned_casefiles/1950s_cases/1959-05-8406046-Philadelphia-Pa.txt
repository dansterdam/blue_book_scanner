4 the pictures are mounted on slide holders. The others are on strip 35 mm film.

It seems that the place which developed the film did not think there was anything on the 35-mm part of the film.

If you look at these closely, you will find one of the best pictures of the group. In one of the photos there may appear to be more than one object on the film. When photographed at left, it seemed at first. At this speed the object flashed more than once, so that more than one object appears. But at the time, one which was amazing at the time.

The film was developed by Camera Corner at Broad, Chestnut and Cust evening in Philadelphia, and was not touched up or changed in any way.

I hope you may be able to make something out of them, if you would telephone me, as I have not had time for my camera, and had no time to get my telescope out the first night I saw it, within a few minutes.

You will notice that the object appears to be very small and will only show up under enlargement. The picture, with the proper focusing of the lens on the projection causing the moment.

Also you will notice that there was...
