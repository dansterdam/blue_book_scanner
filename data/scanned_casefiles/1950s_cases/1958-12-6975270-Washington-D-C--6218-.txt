[REPORT

Description of Aerial Phenomenon Observed in Washington, D.C. on 6 December 1958.

On 6 December 1958, at approximately 8:15 AM, an unidentified aerial phenomenon was observed in the skies over Washington, D.C. The witness, a resident of the District of Columbia, reported seeing a dark, rectangular-shaped object floating silently at a high altitude. The object appeared to be approximately 10 feet in length and 4 feet in width. It was described as being black in color and did not exhibit any visible means of propulsion. The object remained in view for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing from sight.

The witness immediately contacted the United States Air Force, who investigated the incident as part of Project Blue Book, the official U.S. government program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects. Photographic evidence was obtained, but the identity and origin of the object remain unknown.

This report is submitted for inclusion in the records of Project Blue Book. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the nature and source of the observed aerial phenomenon.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

UNKNOWN AERIAL OBJECTS OBSERVED OVER WASHINGTON, D. C. AREA
6 DECEMBER 1958

On 6 December 1958, a number of unidentified flying objects were observed over the Washington, D. C. area. The sightings were made by several reliable witnesses, including a number of Air Force personnel. The objects were tracked on radar and observed visually.

The radar returns showed that the objects were able to perform maneuvers that indicated they were under intelligent control. The objects were observed to accelerate rapidly, make sharp turns, and hover in a manner that could not be easily explained by conventional aircraft. 

Several of the witnesses described the objects as circular in shape and emitting a bright glow. The objects were estimated to be between 20-30 feet in diameter.

This incident was thoroughly investigated by Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for the study of unidentified flying objects. The case remains classified as "unresolved" due to the lack of a conclusive explanation for the observed phenomena.
