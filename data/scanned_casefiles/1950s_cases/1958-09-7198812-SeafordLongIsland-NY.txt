Here is the text from the document:

On Sept. 27, 1957, at about 11:25 P.M. in a clear night I was driving to my home at 255 East 29th St., New York City. I looked up at the stars on the south side of 2nd Ave. and observed an unusual waiting for a change in the shape-lights. The object seemed to be a circular-ellipsed object streaked across the sky from east to west (traveling in a constant course), and was whitish-green in color. The length of the sighting was about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, and it moved faster than and was brighter than a meteorite (which I have observed in the past). The object left no trail. After it disappeared, the sky was clear and there were other stars visible in the same area. It was at a medium altitude and seemed to be in the vicinity of La Guardia Field.

October 1, 1948
New York 22, N.Y.

Office of Unidentified Flying Objects
United States Air Force
Munitions Building
Washington, D. C.

Gentlemen:

I wish to report a sighting of an unidentified flying object, called "flying saucer" in certain circles, on September 28, at about 11:25 P.M., while passing the street in front of my home.

The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed in a search-southeast-easterly direction and at very first sight seemed to be a meteorite but was traveling at a flat trajectory and was far larger than any meteorite I have observed. It disappeared past a rooftop. I would not venture to speculate as to its actual size or altitude. It seems to appear at each end of the disappearance "puffed up" as though by propulsion, etc., showing "speed trails" on aircraft (which in the latter are of course invisible).

My first impulse was to report this to the local office of the U.S. Weather Bureau, and then I decided to spend a few days thinking over this unusual experience. I am a former airline pilot, having flown thousands of hours, and am even hesitant to report this to anyone but my closest friends.

I feel that I am unusually qualified in my observation inasmuch as I am a former airline pilot. I am a Comm. airline pilot, having Airline Transport Certificate No. 4765.

The length of my sighting was from 1 to 1 1/2 seconds as nearly as it was possible to estimate. Other than the facts contained herein, there is nothing else I can add except to say that an airliner passed several seconds after the object disappeared.

It will be greatly appreciated if you will extend me the courtesy of an acknowledgement.

Yours very truly,
[signature redacted]
