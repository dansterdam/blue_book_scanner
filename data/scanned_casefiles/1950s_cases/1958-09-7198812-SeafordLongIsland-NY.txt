On Sept. 28 1958, at about 11:25 P.M. on a clear night, I was standing to my home at 255 East 50th St., New York, N.Y. I looked up at the stars on the south side of 2nd Ave., after observing that and watching a change in the sky-light. Just as I was looking at a circular-ellipsoid object streaked across the sky on an azimuth of about 60 degrees (remaining in a constant course) and was observed from further view since it disappeared about the sky's edge. The length of the sighting was about 1 to 2 seconds. The object was larger than any meteoric (which I had thought it was) and moved two lights at a pace with no variation. Sighted by [Illegible Field].

October 1, 1958
New York 22, N.Y.

Office of Unidentified Flying Objects
United States Air Force
Pentagon Building
Washington, D. C.

Gentlemen:

I wish to report a sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object, call-ed "Flying saucer" in certain claims, on September 28, at about 11:25 P.M., while crossing the street in front of my home.

The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed in a south-southeasterly direction and at very first sight seemed to be a meteorite but was traveling at a flat trajectory and was far larger than any meteorite I have observed. It disappeared past a rooftop. I would not venture to speculate as to its actual size or altitude. Trails seemed to appear at each end of the disc-like object, similar to those seen in advertisements, etc., showing "speed trails" on aircraft (which in the latter are of course invisible).

My first impulse was to report this to the local office of the U.S. Weather Bureau, and then I decided to spend a few days thinking over this unusual experience. No newspaper have been notified, inasmuch as I do not seek publicity of any kind and am even hesitant to report this to any but my closest friends.

I feel that I am unusually qualified in my observation inasmuch as I am a former air line pilot, having flown for Trans-Caribbean Airways as well as other air lines. My Airman Certificate is 164.

The length of my sighting was from 1 to 1 1/2 seconds as nearly as it was possible to estimate. Other than the facts contained herein, there is nothing else I can add except to say that an airliner passed overhead several seconds later inbound to La'Guardia Field.

It will be greatly appreciated if you will extend me the courtesy of an acknowledgement.

Yours very truly,

[Signature redacted]
