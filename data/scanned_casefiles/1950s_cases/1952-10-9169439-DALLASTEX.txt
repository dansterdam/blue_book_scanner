AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

NARRATIVE BY 1ST LT. WALTER H. BAXTER, III, 201039A

At 1812 CST, 28 October 1952, while waiting for a commercial airliner at Love Field, Dallas, Texas, I witnessed an unidentified flying object bearing of 180 degrees from Gate 7 of the terminal. Its flight path was generally 15 to 20 miles an hour, approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, distance unknown. Its speed was unknown, but the object completed an arc of about 15 degrees in from NE to SW.

There was considerable air traffic in the vicinity (normal Love Field activity) and there was enough light that aircraft were identifiable as to general type when viewed in the southwest. The arc was a flat, orange colored light which appeared to be nothing more than the exhaust or running lights of an aircraft. Then, I noticed that the light gave off an exhaust trail similar to that of a rocket. I watched the light in its descending path show four (4) seconds then, it seemed to fire a number of "rockets" and vanished. There was no change in flight path, nothing to indicate a crash, and no reason to believe that the light had done more than burn itself out. The burst of light previously referred to as "rockets" looked somewhat like HVN FIRE at that time of day.

The sighting was also witnessed by Dr. and Mrs. of Arlington, State College, Arlington, Texas. Noted that he was a former Lt. Comdr. and Navy Pilot.

Dr. and I reported the sighting to the U.S. Weather Office at Love Field, who apparently did not know what to do nor with the information we were told. Now, nor did the individual concerned take our names. Nothing was said concerning any explanation, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting. The sky was clear and visibility excellent.

I am a rated pilot on flying status and returned from air combat operations in Korea in late August 1952.

COMMENTS BY Preparing Officer:

1. Observer was questioned as to whether the object could have possibly been a meteor. He stated that he was too flat for it to have been a meteor. As to source, Lt. Baxter is newly assigned to this organization as of 29 Aug 1952. However, he has proven himself to be a sober, reliable individual, and his record bears this out.
