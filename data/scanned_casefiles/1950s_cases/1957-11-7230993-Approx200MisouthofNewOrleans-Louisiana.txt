GULF OF MEXICO, 5 NOVEMBER 1957
COAST GUARD CUTTER SEBAGO

Unidentified Flying Object was observed at 0510Z, position 25.47N 89.24W, Sebago course 023 degrees true. First contact by ship's radar bearing 290 degrees true at 14 miles. Target moving in north to south direction. No visual or audible contact. At 0513Z target closed to two miles returned up port side from south to north. Contact lost at 0514Z. Second contact at 0516Z bearing 183 degrees true, range 22 miles. Target at 0518Z, 190 degrees true and 55 miles. Third contact at 0502Z bearing 350 degrees true, range 7 miles. Target appeared stationary. At 0537Z target faded from scope at 015 degrees true, range 175 miles. Fourth contact (only visual contact) was at 0521Z bearing 270 degrees true target angle 31 degrees moving in horizontal direction from south to north. Visual contact held through 270 degrees to 310 degrees for approximately three seconds. Object resembled brilliant plane. High rate of speed.

The impression that there was only one object is erroneous. Each time succeeding target picked up it was in almost the direct opposite direction from preceding target and considerable distance away. Since 3 radar contacts were observed in a period of about 6 minutes, then disappears, anomalous propagation (false target) is the most likely cause of the radar sighting. The visual target was determined to be a meteor.

SUBJECT:     Evaluation of UFO Report, Gulf of Mexico                                5 Jun 63

TO:          TDEM/Capt Quintanilla

Opinions regarding 5 Nov 1957 Gulf of Mexico reports:

a. Speeds of two of three radar sightings are compatible
   with aircraft speeds.

b. If planes were flying at very low altitudes (below 1000 ft),
   they would "drop out" at distances around 55M. (Assuming ship's
   antenna height = 100 ft).

c. "Second time around" signals might act like this - be erratic,
   and drop out at what looks like short ranges.

d. If the target in the third sighting actually did "hover" -
   i.e., if the range remained constant, it would indicate either a
   balloon, or a false target - probably the latter, since the contact
   apparently lasted only about 1 minute.

e. Since 3 radar contacts were observed in a period of about
   6 minutes, then disregard - it seems most likely that anomalous
   propagation (false targets) is the answer.
