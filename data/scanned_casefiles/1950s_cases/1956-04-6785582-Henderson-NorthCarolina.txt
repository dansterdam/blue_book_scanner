Here is the text from the document:

Case - Henderson N. C.   This report was submitted by J. Edgar Hoover, Chief, FBI.   Dr. Hynek arranged for a personal interview with Miss (now Mrs. ____) and her (then) fiance, Mr. ______, who also observed the object that whizzed over their car on a lonely North Carolina road just before dawn on 16 April 56.   Mrs. _____ is an FBI employee and Mr. ______, according to Dr. Hynek, is believed to be a member of the CIA.   In such, they are confident to be reliable informants.   Further, they both expressed concern over the UFO sighting from the publicity vie-point, and the affect it may have on their professions.   They were assured that their interests would be secured.   The object was seen for only a few fleeting seconds.   It resembled a "large top" in outline.   They emphatically stated that it was not a newspaper, a large bird (owl, Canadian goose) or similar object that they observed.   Dr. Hynek and the undersigned reasoned that a possibly that it may have been a kite dangling from its string that was hanging over the road from a telephone pole, wire or tree.   Also, it was March and kites are flown quite extensively by children in that locality.   The outline of a kite, when silhouetted, does resemble a "large top" which would startle the drivers that flashed underneath it, first hitting it with their headlight beam.   However, case placed in "insufficient info" category.

Henderson, North Carolina - Miscellaneous - Information Concerning

On April 6, 1956, Miss [redacted], an employee of this Bureau who
resides at [redacted], Avenue, Alexandria, Virginia, with her fiance, Mr. [redacted], Jr., observed an unusual

Miss [redacted] stated at about 5 A.M., on April 6, 1956, while it was still
dark and while driving on Route 1 north of Henderson, North Carolina, she and Mr. [redacted]
were startled by what appeared to be an oval-shaped, low-flying object coming directly
towards their car at a great speed, on the driver's side. Miss [redacted] stated the object,
which was less than 25 feet from the ground, appeared to be spinning, was bright as though
containing a series of lights in a zigzagging pattern, was a light blue in color and was at
least as wide as the highway and no more than from two to four feet in thickness. She
stated the object did not change shapes, it made no sound and that she observed it for only
a few seconds before it appeared to pass over the car, accelerate speed and then off out
of sight behind them. Miss [redacted] advised when daylight came she noticed it was cloudy
and that approximately 30 minutes after they had sighted the object it began to rain.

*Letter to Director of Special Investigations
The Inspector General
Department of the Air Force

Miss [redacted] advised Mr. [redacted], an employee of the National Security agency

TO: Commander, Air Defense Command, ATTN: 4602d AISS, Ent AFB, Colorado Springs, Colorado

1. In accordance with paragraph 4c, AFR 200-2, and to properly place the sighting submitted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation under an appropriate category, it is the opinion of this Center that more detailed information should be obtained from the observer of the UFO, through the nearest 4602d AISS unit.

2. Brief, basic data submitted in the FBI report is insufficient upon which to attempt an analysis or form some firm conclusion towards resolving the reported sighting.

3. Elapsed time, apparently the unavoidable result of necessary channels between the government agencies involved, should not preclude the collection of additional information in exhausting all efforts to identify the object in question.

4. Inasmuch as this case has been brought officially to the attention of the Air Force by an investigative agency of the government, and members of the FBI are generally considered as reliable sources, this request for investigative action is believed warranted.

5. Request this matter be referred to as the [redacted] Case in any communication or reply regarding this sighting.

Miss [redacted]
[redacted] Avenue
Alexandria, Virginia

Dear Miss [redacted]:

Captain Gregory, of the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has asked me to talk with you if possible relative to a sighting of an unidentified object you made on April 16, 1956. This matter came to our attention through a letter from the office of J. Edgar Hoover directed to the Air Force. I have long been a technical consultant to the Air Force on subject matters and it so happens that I shall be in Washington from July 21 to July 24.

I shall attempt to phone you sometime over the weekend but if I fail to make connection, I wonder whether you would be kind enough to leave a message for me in care of Mr. [redacted], Avenue. I regret that I do not have his phone number at hand but it is listed in the phone book.

I would like very much to have more details on your sighting, of course, to attempt an identification. We like to keep our "unknowns" at as low a level as possible.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Astronomer

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD                                                  21 Sept 56

SUBJECT: [redacted] Case, Henderson, N. C. - Personal Interview by
Dr. J. A. Hynek

1. Reference letter from Dr. Hynek addressed to Miss[redacted]
FBI employee, regarding a proposal for an interview on the sighting observed by her on 16 April 1956.  Letter in case file.

2. The following are the results of conferences held between Dr. Hynek and the undersigned on 13 September 1956 at Cambridge, Massachusetts:

a. Miss [redacted], who is now married to her fiance (and co-observer of the sighting) was interviewed together with her husband, Mr.[redacted], Mr. [redacted] is believed to be a member of the CIA. As such, this would place both Mr. and Mrs.[redacted] in a "reliable category".

b. The object which passed over their car at dawn was observed for only a fleeting instant. It rushed from the front of their car and Mrs. [redacted] turned to observe it flashing by from the rear window. Under questioning they agreed it resembled a "large top" in outline.

c. Both insisted that it was not a newspaper or large bird, such as owl, goose, etc. that suddenly flew over their car while speeding through the darkness.

3. Dr. Hynek and the undersigned approached the following possible explanation of the sighting from the only slim clue: "It looked like a large top in outline":

a. It was March and children do considerable kite flying at this time of year and in this locality.

b. Kites are usually snagged in telephone wires or trees through-out the United States, and the general size and shape of a kite does resemble a large top in outline.

c. A kite hanging from its string, and a few feet above the highway, would seem to suddenly pass over the car with "startling speed" and disappear from the rear window.

4. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted], being members of intelligence agencies, told a sincere and straightforward story and expressed concern that there be no publicity, inasmuch as it could reflect on their professions.

5. Although the above explanation is very limited and the best that could be given under the circumstances, the sighting will be placed under an "insufficient info" category until such time more information is obtained.
