Case - Henderson, N. C. This report was submitted by J. Edgar Hoover, Chief, FBI.  Dr. Knox arranged for a personal interview with Mrs. (name redacted) and her husband (name redacted), who claim observed the object that whizzed over their car on a lonely North Carolina road just before dawn on 16 April 56.  Further, they both expressed concern over the UFO sighting from the publicity standpoint, and they do not wish to have their relationship made known.  The object was seen for only a few fleeting seconds.  It assembled into a mushroom shape and then disappeared as a boomerang shape.  The observers could not determine the color or size of the object.  The undersigned reached this conclusion:  the possibility that this may have been a hit-and-run incident from the spring meteor shower was being considered.  Also, it was March and kites are quite extensively flown by children in that locality.  The conclusion was also reached that a large top-shaped object resembling a kite or a small balloon descending could possibly be the driver that flashed underneath it, first asking is with their headlights.  However, the observers care detested that their first sighting was with their naked eyes.

1. In accordance with paragraph 4e, AFR 200-2, and to properly place the sighting submitted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation under an appropriate category, it is the opinion of this Center that more detailed information should be obtained from the Director of the UFOB program at the nearest 46028 AISS unit.

2. Submittal basis data submitted in the FBI report is insufficient upon which to attempt an analysis or form some firm conclusion towards resolving the reported sighting.

3. Elapsed time, apparently the unverifiable result of necessary changes between the government agencies involved, should not preclude the collection of additional information in exhausting all efforts to identify the objects in question.

4. Inasmuch as this case has been brought officially to the attention of the Air Force by the FBI, this Center has been directed by members of the FBI are generally considered as reliable sources, this request for investigative action is believed warranted.

5. Request this matter be referred to as the ***** Case in any communication or reply regarding this sighting.

The text of the letter is as follows:

July 19, 1956

Miss _____ Avenue 
Alexandria, Virginia

Dear Miss _____,

Captain Gregory, of the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has asked me to call with you regarding an unidentified flying object made on April 10, 1954. This matter came to our attention through a letter from the office of J. Edgar Hoover directed to the Air Force. We have long been a matter of interest and discussion, and I shall be in Washington from July 21 to July 24.

I shall attempt to phone you sometime over the weekend but it will be difficult to make connections. I wonder whether you will be able to make some convenient for me in care of Mr. _____ Avenue. I cannot give his phone number at hand but it is listed in the phone book.

I would like very much to have more details on your sighting and, of course, to attempt an identification. We like to keep our unknowns at as low a level as possible.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Astronomer
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a memorandum for record regarding a sighting case involving Dr. J. A. Hynek, who is described as a witness to the sighting. The memorandum provides details about the sighting, including the description of a kite-like object observed by the witness and their spouse, who were believed to be members of intelligence agencies. The document concludes with a statement that the sighting will be placed under an "Unidentified" category until such time more information is obtained.

Output of the text found in the document:

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD 21 Sept 56
SUBJECT: Dr. J. A. Hynek Case. Henderson, N. C. - Personal Interview by Capt. USAF

1. Reference letter from Dr.Hynek addressed to Miss Mme employees regarding a proposed interview on the sighting observed by her on 16 April 1956. Letter in case file.

2. The following are the results of conference held between Dr. Hynek and the undersigned on 13 September 1956 at Cambridge, Massachusetts:

a. Miss , who is now married to her then fiancee (and observer of the sighting) was interviewed together with her husband. Mrs. is believed to be a member of the CIA. As such, this would place both Mr. and Mrs. and a "classified category".

b. The object which passed over their car at dawn was observed for only a fleeting instant. It rushed the front of their car and Mrs. turned around to observe it flashing by from the rear window. Under questioning they were unable to furnish any large details.

c. Both insisted that it was not a newspaper or large bird, such as owl, goose, etc. that suddenly flew across their car while speeding through the darkness.

3. Dr. Hynek and the undersigned approached the following possible explanation of the sighting from the only film clue: "It looked like a large kite".

a. It was March and children do considerable kite flying at this time of year and in this locality.

b. Kites are usually snagged in telephone wires or trees throughout the United States, and the general size and shape of a kite does resemble a large toy.

c. A kite hanging from its string, and a few feet above the highway, would seem to suddenly pass over the car and "startling speed" and disappear from the rear window.

4. Mr. and Mrs. being members of intelligence agencies, told a publisher and newspaper correspondent that there be no publicity. Although the above explanation is feasible, the sighting will be placed under an "Unidentified" category until such time more information is obtained.

Captain, USAF
