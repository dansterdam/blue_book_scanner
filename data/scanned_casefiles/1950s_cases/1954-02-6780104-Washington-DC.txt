Enclosure to Investigativc Observers
Washington, D. C.

OR 23 February 1954 at 1:45 I was waiting for a chance to get to the Washington airport when I noticed the object high in the sky. It appeared to be a jet airplane flying at a very high altitude for about 7 minutes. It made no sound that I could hear. I called several others who were near me to look at it. They agreed with me that it was a jet airplane flying at a very high altitude. After about 7 minutes, the object increased its speed and climbed straight up and out of sight. I called to my secretary, who was inside the building, to come out and look at it but she did not see it as she came out just as it disappeared from view.

OR 25 February 1954. It was about the same time in the afternoon and in about the same location. I was again waiting for a chance to get to the Washington Airport when I noticed the object again. This time it appeared to be slightly larger than the first time I saw it. It also appeared to be a jet airplane but it was flying at a tremendous speed and making no sound. After appearing to be stationary for a few seconds, it suddenly increased its speed and climbed straight up and out of sight.

As the object passed it seemed to reflect the sun's rays, and this perhaps caused it to appear slightly larger than the first time I saw it. The object changed direction and went straight up and out of sight; appearing to be of tremendous speed. I called to others who were near me but they did not see it as it had disappeared so quickly. The speed of the object was such that I could not estimate it, but it was far in excess of any jet airplane I have ever seen.

I may have seen a similar object another day but I cannot say for certain.

- page 5 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

It is reported that the object was not an airplane or a lookout for the following reasons: the extreme rate of speed of the object which enabled it to fade from view in such a manner, and the fact that it had changed direction in such a manner.

The text indicates that the surface was flat, and that this was substantiated when the object passed directly overhead as a witness. The text also mentions that the object was observed for a relatively short duration during the time it was visible.

COMMENTS REGARDING SPECIAL CASE ON TV PROGRAM

round and solid, of a dull silver or gray color, seen by the observer at 1630 p.m., Feb. 3, 1954, near Ft. Washington, Md. It appeared to be a very bright silvered colored object, flying horizontal at a high elevation, with a very sharp outline. The object was sighted by the observer and several other persons in the area at the same time. No sound was detected. Several significant points here in this account, observer at 1630, Ft. Washington, MD, bright silvered object, flying horizontal at high elevation, sharp outline, witnessed by observer and several other persons.

MR. PYLES, with his telescope, observed an elongated object in the dark that appeared to be luminous. The object lifted up rapidly being observed as a "bright" object for several minutes. The object behaved in a similar manner to many similar reports received from other parts of the country. Objects sighted were at an altitude of about 100,000 feet, going 1200 MPH, from N. Washington, D. C.

The text describes the sighting of a bright, silvered colored object that was observed by the reporter and several other people near Fort Washington, Maryland on February 3, 1954 around 4:30pm. The object was flying horizontally at a high elevation and had a very sharp outline. There were also reports of an elongated, luminous object observed with a telescope that rapidly lifted up, behaving similarly to many other reports received from around the country. These objects were reported to be at an altitude of around 100,000 feet and travelling at 1200 mph from the Washington D.C. area.

INCIDENT
7 - 8 May 1957

From the testimony of the observers, and general landmarks in the photographs, the direction, bearings and elevations of the objects were determined. It was established that the sightings were observed in the direction of a U.S. Army Proving Ground area a few miles away. Further investigations definitely confirmed that between the 6th and 12th of the month, large scale and operations were taking place in the proving-ground area, as part of a joint-defense problem.

A considerable amount of artillery, mortar and anti-aircraft, rocket fire, tracers, and flares, including dropping of parachute types, filled the sky during this period. Aircraft participated. A crowd, reported as 4000 people, witnessed the exercises from within the Army grounds.

REPORT FROM G-2, FT. BENNING, GA.

1. In discussions with Col. H. W. Cook, G-2, it was revealed that extensive operations and rehearsals took place in the Aberdeen Proving Ground Area and vicinity between 6 and 12 May 1957, as part of a Joint-Defense problem.

2. The following participated, or took place:
a. Army L-20's dropping flares
b. Firing of 155mm shells and flares
c. Firing of 4.2mm mortar shells and flares (Note: These give high intensity but short duration lights. The object below the aircraft in some of the frames appears to be an object in this category)
d. 90mm AA firings
e. Ground rockets
f. Extensive use of VT fuses

3. The air was literally filled with shot, shell, flares and tracers (Quoting G-2)

4. Approximately 4000 people in the grounds witnessed the display. 

This report was given to Capt. George T. Gregory and Mr. Blick Armament Specialist.

EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE INCIDENT
2 May 1957

At approximately 0800 in the morning two Air Force camera specialists (on their way to a photo-theodolite station) were startled to see, what they described as a disc-shaped object that glinted brightly in the morning sun. Within a matter of minutes they had set up their specialized photographic device, and commenced taking photographs of the object as they tracked it for approximately 25 minutes.

The two men estimated the object to be approximately 150 feet in diameter and was traveling from West to East. 

While a check was being made for all possible aircraft, radar and flight test operators and activities that could provide some data on the probable cause of the sighting, the photos were being carefully analyzed by ATIC. Each photo image was subject to an analysis taking into consideration all the optical characteristics and limitations of the camera, the distances involved, magnification factor of the enlargements, path and characteristics of the object, and the local meteorological conditions in the area.

During this period, radar, aircraft and nearby flight-test units reported nothing was in the area at that time. A reply to a call made to a nearby weather unit had not been received as yet. Meanwhile, screen-sized projections of the 40 odd frames showed that the object went from elliptical in shape as it came across the frame, back to elliptical as it exited the frame, striking the surface, and was definitely a spherical object.

The report also mentions that a balloon was released by the weather unit shortly before the observers spotted the object, and that the balloon's elevations, bearings, and times coincided almost exactly with those of the camera crew's observations.

The optical analysis plot, graphically depicted, indicated that the probable size of the object was between 5 to 12 feet in diameter, and the distance at which it was observed was between 6 to 12 miles.

A reply from the weather unit confirmed that a balloon was released
West of the observers, approximately five minutes before they observed it, visually. Further, the balloon was tracked by precise instruments. The elevations, bearings and times coincided almost exactly with those of the camera crew.

9 MARCH 1957

At approximately 3 o'clock in the morning of 9 March 1957, Pan-American Airways flight 257 was speeding through the darkness at 19,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean with 27 passengers and a crew of 5 aboard.

The aircraft's position was approximately 300 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida, considerably west of its normal course in order to avoid a storm. The captain was... 

As though calling out to others, a peculiar, white, luminous light suddenly appeared ahead of the aircraft. The flight engineer, who was in the copilot's seat at the time, also noticed the object. For a split second it seemed to hover motionless, then with tremendous speed shot away, leaving behind a trail of glow. The object was so brilliant that it momentarily blinded the crew.

A number of passengers were injured during the violent maneuvers, and required hospitalization upon landing.

Intensive checks with all military, naval and civil activities in the area failed to disclose any known aerial activity, nor any launches, "dummy" missiles from Cape Canaveral. The Air Force investigators reached the determination of the object. (From statements herein ...)"

of the pilot and a number of passengers who happened to get a glimpse of the UFO) which was generally described as "dazzling, reddish-white in color with a greenish tinge;" and, the fact that two airline pilots (one more considerable distance in front of the PAA airliner) the other about 1.75 miles to the east) had seen the object at the same instant.
This further supports the fact that the objects were not aircraft or missiles.

The Air Force concluded that the object was a solid-seon form of a meteor, a "bolide," other referred to as a "fireball." The Air Force's analysis was submitted by a well-known astrophysicist, not with the conclusion that it was an aircraft, but that it was probably a meteor-physical phenomena, independent observation concerned with.

OLD "UTO CLASSIC" -
ABSTRACT SPECIAL STUDY
(MOTION PICTURE FILM)

TWO Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) were sighted and photographed 
at about 11:30 MST on August 15, 1950 by Mr. and Mrs.[REDACTED] at Great 
Falls, Montana. The sighting took place during an inspection of this ball park.  
[REDACTED] (and his secretary, also present at the time) first noticed the
UFO's as silvery objects to the NW, accidentally when looking to sell the
wind by the smoke from the Anaconda Copper Company smokestack nearby.

The UFO's drew his attention to the extent that he ran 60 feet from the
grandstand to the parking lot, got his motion picture camera (Revere turret
type 16mm) out of his car and began tracking the UFO's which appeared
to him to have stopped in mid-air, remained stationary for a while and then,
with a swooshing sound flashed away to the left (SW keeping about the same
distance from each other until they were lost from sight.

The color film (Daylight Kodachrome) was submitted to the Air Force.
It was studied and analyzed by the Air Force and the U.S. Navy. 

The original Air Force conclusion, based on the interrogation of
witnesses and the evaluation of the data, was that the UFO's were. In all
probability, two Air Force T-33 fighter aircraft known to be in the
vicinity at the time.

THE MARIANA CASE
5 or 15 Aug 1950
Simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances, made by an 
aircraft research firm in a recent independent and unsolicited analysis
of the ------ films, show striking similarity to the two white blobs
in this film.
Based on the degree of credibility accorded this early ATIC evaluation
and the strong corroborative evidence supplied by the recent independent
analysis, the Air Force has no compelling reason to alter its original
conclusion.

TRUE "UNKNOWN"

INCIDENT

24 July 1948

At 2:45 in the morning, the pilot and co-pilot of an Eastern Airlines DC-3, flying at 5,000 feet between Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama, sighted a dull red exhaust some 700 feet ahead, a little above and to the right of the airliner.

Captain [redacted], the pilot, immediately turned to his co-pilot and remarked: "Look, here comes a new Army jet job".

The object approached in a slight dive, deflected a little to the left and passed the plane on the right, almost level and parallel to the flight path, at a distance of approximately one-half mile. After passing, it pulled up sharply and disappeared into a cloud.

The object appeared to be a wingless aircraft, 100 ft. long, cigar-shaped and about twice the diameter of a "B-29". It had no fins or protruding surfaces. [Redacted] thought it had a "snout" similar to a radar dome on the front and he had the impression there was a cabin with windows above -- more like a pilot compartment -- except that it appeared brighter. The illumination inside the body itself approximated the brilliance of a magnesium flare. He saw no occupants nor did he [redacted].

The entire sighting, which was intense, fairly rapid, blue-green running the entire length of the object beneath the fuselage.

INCIDENT
24 July 1948
The glow reminded of a blue fluorescent factory light. The exhaust was described as a red-orange flame, the lighter color (orange) being predominant about the outer edges. thought the flame flared out from a nozzle in the rear which he thought he perceived. The flame extended some 50 feet behind the object as it pulled up into a cloud. No disturbance was felt from air waves, nor was there any wash or mechanical disturbance when the object passed. No sound was heard.
Co-pilot attention was drawn to the object by a remark. His description of the object and its maneuvers was very similar to that of except that he did not observe a cockpit in front nor did he see any radar "scopes". His drawing and description also indicated windows or openings on the side. He estimated the object passed at greater distance than did Capt. He saw the "exhaust" as a parallel wide flame which appeared to come from the entire rear of the object rather than from a nozzle never growing any wider than the width of the object itself, although he noticed the increased length of the flame as the object "pulled up".
The night was clear with a bright moon and broken cloud coverage of 4/10 at 5,000 ft. Both estimated the object to be in sight approximately 10 to 15 seconds, considered sufficient time for experienced pilots to determine whether the "light" was a reflection on, caused by some atmospheric or astronomical phenomena -- or was a material object.

The image appears to contain a report on a UFO incident that occurred on 7 January 1943. The report describes a flight of four P-51 aircraft from Marietta Air Base in Georgia to Standiford Field in Louisville, Kentucky, where the flight was contacted by the Godman Field Control Tower and asked to identify an object in the sky. The report states that Captain Mantell, who was leading the flight, attempted to identify the object but was unable to do so. The report further describes Captain Mantell's climb to an altitude of approximately 22,000 feet in an attempt to identify the object, before he was last observed at a maximum climb of 22,500 feet with the aircraft in perfect control. The report indicates that Captain Mantell was heard to say in a ship-to-ship conversation that he would go to 25,000 feet for about ten minutes and then come down, but transmission was garbled and attempts to contact Captain Mantell by radio were unanswered.

CAPTAIN INCIDENT
7 January 1943

On 7 January 1943 at approximately 1450-1455, Captain ★★★★★ was
leading a flight of four P-51 aircraft on a flight from Marietta Air Base,
Marietta, Georgia to Standiford Field at Louisville, Kentucky. Nearing
Godman Field, Kentucky, the flight was contacted by the Godman Field
Control Tower and requested to identify an object in the sky if the
mission would permit. Captain Mantell reported that his mission was ferrying
aircraft and that he would attempt to identify the object in the sky. Captain
Mantell began a maximum climb in left spirals until about 14,000 feet and from
there a straight climb at maximum, on a compass heading of approximately
220 degrees. No conversation between Captain Mantell and any member of
his flight revealed a clue as to his intentions. One pilot left the flight
as the climb began, the remaining two discontinued the climb at approximately
22000 feet. When last observed by the wing man, Lt. Clemens, Captain
Mantell was in a maximum climb at 22,500 feet, the aircraft in perfect control.
Captain Mantell was heard to say in ship-to-ship conversation that he would
go to 25,000 feet for about ten minutes and then come down. Transmission was
garbled and attempts to contact Captain Mantell by radio were unanswered.
Lt. Clemens was the only pilot equipped with an oxygen mask. "This flight
had been planned and scheduled as a ferry and navigational trip at low level.

The image does not contain a photograph, it is a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document describing the "Captain Mantell Incident" that occurred on January 7, 1948. The text is a detailed description of the incident, including the circumstances surrounding the aircraft's loss of consciousness at approximately 25,000 feet, its gradual turn to the left due to torque, and the subsequent spiraling dive that resulted in the disintegration of the aircraft between 10,000 and 20,000 feet. The text also mentions that parts of the aircraft were found scattered over a wide area, and provides information about the aircraft's descent and impact.

CAPTAIN MANTELL INCIDENT
7 January 1948

Consensus is that Captain Mantell lost consciousness at approximately 25000 feet, the P-51 being trimmed for a maximum climb continued to climb gradually leveling out as increasing altitude caused decrease in power. The aircraft began to fly in reasonably level attitude at about 30000 feet. It then began a gradual turn to the left because of torque, slowly increasing degree of bank as nose depressed, finally began a spiraling dive which resulted in excessive speeds causing a gradual disintegration of aircraft which probably began between 10000 and 20000 feet.

Since the canopy lock was in place after crash, it is assumed that Captain Mantell made no attempt to abandon the aircraft, and was unconscious at moment of crash or had died from lack of oxygen before aircraft began the spiraling dive from about 3000 feet.

Parts of the aircraft were found as far as six-tenths (estimated) of a mile from central wreckage. The parts were scattered from North to South. The aircraft came straight down in a horizontal position and landed on the left side. The left wing came off while in the air and landed 100 feet from the central wreckage. The aircraft did not slide forward after contact with the ground. Throttle was set one-fourth open, mixture control in "idle-cut-off", and prop control in "feather increase RPM".

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing the "Captain Mantell Incident" that occurred on January 7, 1948.

The text reads as follows:

CAPTAIN MANTELL INCIDENT
7 January 1948

An official board of inquiry, which made intensive study of the crash reported that Mantell, an aggressive pilot attempted to pursue the object as long as possible, even though he knew he lacked oxygen.

Of significance, is the fact that although a number of witnesses observed the object, there were some discrepancies in their description of the object. The size of the object given ranged from "small" to "tremendous" and the shape as a "parachute", "ball", "ice-cream cone", "round", "disc", etc.

Although considerations was given to the objects being the planet Venus, because the times and bearings given by observers generally agree with the bearings and elevation of the body at the time, official files disclose that it was later determined that a large Navy "Sky Hook" balloon was released from a location in southern Ohio. This was a classified project, and the existence of the huge balloons were known only to a few. A wind plot for that day indicated that the balloon would have passed near the area in which the object was observed.

Because Mantell was in the same relative position as the object observed, undoubtedly some of the witnesses saw this body rather than the balloon.

CAPTAIN MANTELL INCIDENT
7 January 1948

In fact, it is possible that in some phase of his climb, Capt Mantell may have been trying to close in on Venus, as is borne out by his remarks that he could not gain on the object.

In all events, the UFO was a conventional object.
