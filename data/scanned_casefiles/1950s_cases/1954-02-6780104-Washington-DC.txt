Enclosure to Tentative Observers
Questionnaire

On 23 February 1954 at 1:45 I was waiting for a bus at the stop located at 14th Street and Madison on the Mall just East of the Washington Monument.

I had been observing a jet airplane at very high altitude for about seven minutes. It was so far away that with some effort I could see the jet and then headed north and turned in a wide curve and headed due west. This jet was just a speck to my vision and was leaving a vapor trail. Then, as noted, I began to see some passengers of the bus on which I travel home also began to observe the jet plane also.

Suddenly an object came into view and she (the passenger) called my attention to it. She saw the object about one second before I did. The object, apparently metallic, first appeared to be at quite a distance from us (possibly four miles). It was traveling in a north-westerly direction from first sighted and curved off into a north-easterly direction toward the jet plane. The object had some details on the side face (not on). All I can remember was seeing an arc along the upper part of the circle which had a slightly larger radius than the circumference.

On 25 February 1954 I spoke with the passenger while we were riding home. She told me that she had seen a series of lines on the object and drew me a sketch which looked like the following:

[A hand-drawn sketch of an object with lines is shown]

As the object passed by it seemed to reflect the sun rays. This reflection reached a peak after several seconds of observation. When the object changed direction and went off towards the "on-way" the reflection was less vivid. The object was seen for several more seconds and appeared to be flat like a wafer. Finally the object faded from sight going in the same relative direction. (Noted at about 45 degrees). When it was first viewed it was described slightly. The object was hard to describe. It was last sighted as a small object.

The speed of the object cannot be judged but was far in excess of that of the jet which had been but a little distance relative to its total distance. The object was apparently very fast.

The size of the object is hard to be at least several times that of the entire wing of the jet. The position of the object changed a little during the observation.

Note: My eyes were checked a month ago and were found to be 20-10.


- page 5 -

Here is the text from the document:

It is certain that the object was not an airplane or a local fog the
following reasons:

extreme rate of speed of object which enabled it to
side from view in such a short time.

a local could not have changed direction in such a
manner.

The rigid shape of the object precludes the possibility
of its being either a balloon or airplane.

The radiant light indicated that the surface was flat.
This was substantiated when the object changed direction and was seen
as a wafer. The flat plane covered a relatively short distance during
the time the object was observed.

COMMENTS REGARDING SPECIAL CASES ON TV PROGRAM

Washington, D.C., 23 Feb 1954, 1630 P.M. Silvered colored object, round and solid, and reflecting sunlight...as described by the observer. Found to have been a large balloon, released just a few minutes before from Silver Hill, Significant Points: Here the observer at approximately 1600 hrs. near the Washington Ammunition when he observed this after he quit work at 1600 hrs. Numerous other persons leaving from work were there at that time-WE NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON, other than the observer reported this object. He was in the area of the object in the vicinity of 14th and K Streets, N.W. in the observation point of almost a million people would see a strange object over Washington, as a bright, sunny afternoon-strain imagination beyond the breaking point. He also was in a report on 28 August of this year-which he observed at 100,000 feet, going 1200 MPH, from M. Washington, D. C.

MR. _______ observed an elongated object in the dark that appeared to have particular, with light, coming from them. The object traveled from North to SW. There was a bright, full moon in the sky. Significant Points: On basis of investigation object believed to be an airliner. As shown from many similar reports, windows or airplanes give appearance of profile. Important: Object was observed with headquarters which shows that the object must have been of rather small size to the naked eye.

MACON, GEORGIA
7 - 8 May 1957

From the testimony of the observers, and general landmarks in the photographs, the direction, bearings and elevations of the objects were determined. It was established that the sightings were observed in the direction of a U.S. Army Proving Ground area a few miles away. Further investigations definitely confirmed that between the 6th and 12th of the month, large scale rehearsals and operations were taking place in the proving-ground area, as part of a joint-defense problem.

A considerable amount of artillery, mortar and anti-aircraft, rocket fire, tracer, and flares, including dropping of parachute types, filled the sky during this period. Aircraft participated. A crowd, reported as 4000 people, witnessed the exercises from within the Army grounds.

REPORT FROM G-2, FT. BENNING, GA.

1. In discussions with Col. H. W. Greer, G-2, it was revealed that extensive operations and rehearsals took place in the Aberdeen Proving Ground Area and vicinity between 6 and 12 May 1957, as part of a Joint-Defense problem.

2. The following participated, or took place:
a. Army L-20's dropping flares
b. Firing of 155mm shells and flares
c. Firing of 4.2mm mortar shells and flares (Note: These give high intensity but short direction lights. The object below the aircraft in some of the frames appears to be an object in this category)
d. 50mm AA firings
e. Ground rockets
f. Extensive use of VT fuses

3. The air was literally filled with shot, shell, flares and tracers (Quoting G-2)

4. Approximately 4000 people in the grounds witnessed the display.

This report was given to Capt. George T. Gregory and Mr. Blisk Armament Specialist.

BALLOON

EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE
INCIDENT
2 May 1957

At approximately 0800 in the morning two Air Force camera specialists (on their way to a photo-theodolite station) were startled to see, what they described as a disc-shaped object that glinted brightly in the morning sun. Within a matter of minutes they had set up their specialized photographic device, and commenced taking photographs of the object as they tracked it for approximately 25 minutes.

The two men estimated the object to be approximately 150 feet in diameter and was tracked from West to East.

While a check was being made for all possible aircraft, radar and flight test operators and activities that could provide some data on the probable cause of the sighting, the photos were being carefully analysed by ATIC. Each photo image was subject to an analysis taking into consideration all the optical characteristics and limitations of the camera, the distances involved, magnification factor of the enlargements, path and characteristics of the object, and the local meteorological conditions in the area.

During this period, radar, aircraft and nearby flight-test units reported nothing was in the area at that time. A reply to a call made to a nearby weather unit had not been received as yet. Meanwhile, screen-sized projections of the 40 odd frames showed that the object went from elliptical to round, back to elliptical in shape as the sun's rays were striking the surface, and was definitely a spherical object.


- page 13 -

EDWARDS AFB
INCIDENT
2 May 1957

The optical analysis plot, graphically depicted, indicated that the probable size of the object was between 5 to 12 feet in diameter, and the distance at which it was observed was between 6 to 12 miles.

A reply from the weather unit confirmed that a balloon was released West of the observers, approximately five minutes before they observed it, visually. Further, the balloon was tracked by precise instruments. The elevations, bearings and times coincided almost exactly with those of the camera crew.

PAN-AMERICAN AIRLINES INCIDENT
9 March 1957

At approximately 3 o'clock in the morning of 9 March 1957, Pan-American Airways Flight 257 was speeding through the darkness at 19,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean with its cargo of sleeping passengers.

The aircraft's position was approximately 300 miles west of Jacksonville, Florida, considerably west of its normal course in order to avoid a storm. The captain was [redacted] his co-pilot.

As though coming out of nowhere, a glaring, white dazzling light with a pale-green tinge or hue, suddenly appeared heading toward the airliner at high speed. The flight engineer, [redacted], who saw the object bearing down on them at that instant, caught his breath. For a split second [redacted] was bewildered, realizing that he had to act instantly aware of the tremendous responsibility of his passengers' safety that was in his hands. He felt that he had only one course of action by which to save his passengers and ship. He pulled the airliner up sharply, and took evasive action, pitching his passengers about the careening aircraft. He saw the object slip under his right wing, and knew that the object had missed him.

A number of passengers were injured during the violent maneuvers, and required hospitalization upon landing.

Intensive checks with all military, naval and civil activities in the area ruled out jet aircraft, balloons, rocket flights, or possible "runaway" missiles from Cape Canaveral. The two significant clues given to Air Force investigators was the description of the object (from statements)


- page 15 -

of the pilot and a number of passengers who happened to get a glimpse
of the UFO) which was generally described as "dazzling, magnesium white
in color with a greenish tinge" and, the fact that two airline pilots
(one some considerable distance in front of the PAA airliner; the other
about 175 miles to the rear), had seen the object at the same instant.
This further supports the fact that the objects were not aircraft or
missiles.

The Air Force concluded that the object was a seldom-seen form of
a meteor, a "bolide," often referred to as a "Fireball." The Air Force's
analysis was submitted to a well-known astrophysicist, now with the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, at Cambridge, Massachusetts,
where it was independently reviewed, and findings concurred with.

OLD "UFO CLASSIC" - THE [REDACTED] CASE
5 or 15 Aug 1950

Two Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) were sighted and photographed at about 11:30 MST on August 15, 1950 by [redacted] at Great Falls, Montana. Mr. [redacted] Missoula, Montana and is the [redacted]. It was during an inspection of this ball park that the sighting took place.

[redacted] (and his secretary, also present at the time) first noticed the UFO's as silvery objects to the NW, accidentally when looking to tell the wind by the smoke from the Anaconda Copper Company smokestack nearby.

The UFO's drew his attention to the extent that he ran 60 feet from the grandstand to the parking lot, got his motion picture camera (Revere turret type 16mm) out of his car and began tracking the UFO's which appeared to him to have stopped in mid-air, remained stationary for a while and then, with a swooshing sound floated away to the left (SW keeping about the same distance from each other until they were lost from sight.

The color film (Daylight Kodachrome) was submitted to the Air Force.

It was studied and analyzed by the Air Force and the U.S. Navy.

The original Air Force conclusion, based on the interrogation of witnesses and the evaluation of the data, was that the UFO's were, in all probability, two Air Force F-94 fighter aircraft known to be in the vicinity at the time.


- page 17 -

THE MARIANA CASE
5 or 15 Aug 1950

Simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances, made by an aircraft research firm in a recent independent and unsolicited analysis of the [illegible] films, show striking similarity to the two white blops in this film.

Based on the degree of credibility accorded this early ATIC evaluation and the strong corroborative evidence supplied by the recent independent analysis, the Air Force has no compelling reason to alter its original conclusion.

TRUE "UNKNOWN"

INCIDENT
24 July 1948

At 2:45 in the morning, the pilot and co-pilot of an Eastern Airlines DC-3, flying at 5,000 feet between Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama sighted a dull red exhaust some 700 feet ahead, a little above and to the right of the airliner.

Captain [redacted], the Pilot, immediately turned to his co-pilot, [redacted] and remarked: "Look, here comes a new Army jet job".

The object approached in a slight dive, deflected a little to the left and passed the plane on the right, almost level and parallel to flight path, at a distance of approximately one-half mile. After passing, it pulled up sharply and disappeared into a cloud.

The object appeared to be a wingless aircraft, 100 ft. long, cigar-shaped and about twice the diameter of a "B-29". It had no fins or receding surfaces. [redacted] though it had a "snow" similar to a radar pole on the front and he had the impression there was a cabin with windows above so much like a pilot compartment -- except that it appeared brighter. The illumination inside the body itself approximated the brilliance of a magnesium flare. He saw no occupants nor did [redacted]. Visible from the side only, was an intense, fairly dark, blue glow running the entire length of the object beneath the fuselage.


- page 19 -

INCIDENT

24 July 1948

The glow reminded [redacted] of a blue fluorescent factory light. The exhaust was described as a red-orange flame, the lighter color (orange) being predominant about the outer edges. [redacted] thought the flame flared out from a nozzle in the rear which he thought he perceived. The flame extended some 30 to 50 feet behind the object and became deeper in intensity (redder) and increased in length as the object pulled up into a cloud. No disturbance was felt from air waves, nor was there any wash or mechanical disturbance when the object passed. No sound was heard.

Co-pilot [redacted] attention was drawn to the object by [redacted] remark. His description of the object and its maneuvers was very similar to that of [redacted] except that he did not observe a cockpit in front nor did he see any radar "snout". His drawing and description also indicated windows or openings on the side. He estimated the object passed at greater distance than did Capt [redacted]. He saw the "exhaust" as a parallel wide flame which appeared to come from the entire rear of the object rather than from a nozzle never growing any wider than the width of the object itself, although he noticed the increased length of the flame as the object "pulled up".

The night was clear with a bright moon and broken cloud coverage of 4/10 at 6,000 ft. Both estimated the object to be in sight approximately 10 to 15 seconds, considered sufficient time for experienced pilots to determine whether the "ship" was a reflection, caused by some meteorological or astronomical phenomena -- or was a material object.

SKY HOOK BALLOON
(DEATH OF PILOT CHASING
UFO....)

CAPTAIN INCIDENT
7 January 1948

On 7 January 1948 at approximately 1450-1455, Captain was leading a flight of four P-51 aircraft on a flight from Marietta Air Base, Marietta, Georgia to Standford Field at Louisville, Kentucky. Nearing Godman Field, Kentucky, the flight was contacted by the Godman Field Control Tower and requested to identify an object in the sky if the mission would permit. Captain Mantell replied that his mission was ferrying aircraft and that he would attempt to identify the object in the sky. Captain Mantell began a maximum climb in left spirals until about 14000 feet and from there a straight climb at maximum, on a compass heading of approximately 220 degrees. No conversation between Captain Mantell and any member of his flight revealed a clue as to his intentions. One pilot left the flight as the climb began, the remaining two discontinued the climb at approximately 22000 feet. When last observed by the wing man, Lt. Clements, Captain Mantell was in a maximum climb at 225000 feet, the aircraft in perfect control. Captain Mantell was heard to say in ship-to-ship conversation that he would go to 25000 feet for about ten minutes and then come down. Transmission was garbled and attempts to contact Captain Mantell by his flight were unanswered. Lt. Clements was the only pilot equipped with an oxygen mask. This flight had been planned and scheduled as a ferry and navigational trip at low level.

INCIDENT
24 July 1948

After extensive investigations and studies, and consideration of all possible approaches and data pertinent to suggest at least one valid hypothesis or explanation to the sighting were exhausted --- the incident was appropriately classified as a true "Unknown".

CAPTAIN MANTELL INCIDENT
7 January 1948

Consensus is that Captain Mantell lost consciousness at approximately 25000 feet, the P-51 being trimmed for a maximum climb continued to climb gradually leveling out as increasing altitude caused decrease in power. The aircraft began to fly in reasonably level attitude at about 30000 feet. It then began a gradual turn to the left because of torque, slowly increasing degrees of bank as nose depressed, finally began a spiralling dive which resulted in excessive speeds causing a gradual disintegration of aircraft which probably began between 10000 and 20000 feet.

Since the canopy lock was in place after crash, it is assumed that Captain Mantell made no attempt to abandon the aircraft, and was unconscious at moment of crash or had died from lack of oxygen before aircraft began the spiralling dive from about 3000 feet.

Parts of the aircraft were found as far as six-tenths (estimated) of a mile from central wreckage. The parts were scattered from North to South. The aircraft came straight down in a horizontal position and landed on the left side. The left wing came off while in the air and landed 100 feet from the central wreckage. The aircraft did not slide forward after contact with the ground. Throttle was set one-fourth open, mixture control in "Idle-Cut-Off", and prop control in "Full Increase RPM".

CAPTAIN MANTELL INCIDENT
7 January 1948

An official board of inquiry, which made intensive study of the crash reported that Mantell, an aggressive pilot attempted to pursue the object as long as possible, even though he knew he lacked oxygen.

Of significance, is the fact that although a number of witnesses observed the object, there were some discrepancies in their description of the object.

The size of the object given ranged from "small" to "tremendous" and the shape as a "parachute", ball, "ice-cream cone" "round", "disc", etc.

Although consideration was given to the object being the planet Venus, because all the time and bearings given by observers generally agree with the bearings and elevation of the body at the time, official files disclose that it was later determined that a large Navy "Sky Hook" balloon was released from a location in southern Ohio. This was a classified project, and the existence of the huge balloons were known only to a few. A wind plot for that day indicated that the balloon would have passed near the area in which the object was observed.

Because Venus was in the same relative position as the object observed, undoubtedly some of the witnesses saw this body rather than the balloon.

CAPTAIN MANTELL INCIDENT
7 January 1948

In fact, it is possible that in some phase of his climb, Capt Mantell
may have been trying to close in on Venus, as is borne out by his
remarks that he could not gain on the object.

In all events, the UFO was a conventional object.
