Hq. Intelligence Office
3708th Pilot Training Wing
Williams AFB, Chandler, Ariz.

On 3 May, 1952, while attending a meeting at the American Institute of Foreign Trade, Glendale, Arizona, were interviewed and attested Mr. William J. Hull, age 41, 2700 Lewis St., downtown Phoenix in conversation with this officer. On 3 May 1952, they observed an object, which they claimed was a flying saucer. The object was moving west at approximately 500 miles an hour. Neither the size of the object nor its location can be determined. However, it was cigarshaped and about five times as long as it was thick.

It appeared to be ascending or descending, possibly jet end-tailed what appeared to be a color drifting or possibly jet exhaust. The object was observed for about four seconds with a relatively clear view. Mr. Hull is an ex-employee of the U.S. Air Force, a civilian at present, who has worked with aircraft. They had never seen any similar object.

A local call was made to Comstock Inn, Phoenix, Arizona, that area might witnessed the above phenomenon.

On 3 May 1952, [redacted], residing at the American Institute of Foreign Trade, Glendale, Arizona were interviewed by the regional office's 5, 11th CIC Detachment, Phoenix, Arizona and stated in substance as follows: At 2200 hours 3 May 1952, while driving with their wives, [redacted] town Phoenix in a convertible with the top down, they observed an object which they believed to be a flying saucer. The object was moving west at approximately 500 miles per hour. Neither the size of the object, nor its distance, nor altitude could be determined. However, it was clearly shaped and about five times as long as it was thick. It appeared to be descending at a slight angle. It gave off a phosphorescent white glow and emitted what appeared to be a reddish glow. Suddenly, it vanished. The object was observed for about four seconds when it suddenly disappeared from view. This is an excerpt of the United States Air Force, and [redacted] is an ex-pilot of the United States Navy who was formerly a celestial navigator. Both stated that in their experience they had never seen an object quite like this. They reported that approximately 200 people attending an out-door party at Camelback Inn, Phoenix, Arizona, that same night witnessed the above phenomenon.

The reliability of the informants is unknown and therefore, the truth cannot be judged.
