The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, rather than a photograph. It consists of various shapes and symbols arranged in a grid-like pattern. There are what look like X-shaped symbols, as well as arrow-like shapes pointing in different directions, and some smaller shapes that could be interpreted as birds or other objects. The overall impression is of a graphical representation or diagram of some kind, rather than a photographic image.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILES
SUBJECT: Sighting Report - Phoenix, Arizona, March 10, 1952
1. On the evening of March 10, 1952, at approximately 1930 hours, this observer, while on duty at Sky Harbor Airport at Phoenix, Arizona, observed an unusual aerial phenomenon. 
2. The sky was clear, with visibility unlimited, and the object was first observed approximately 40 degrees above the horizon to the east. The object was spherical in appearance, metallic in color, and was traveling in a westerly direction at an estimated speed of 500 to 700 knots. 
3. The object was observed for approximately two minutes, during which it maintained a relatively level flight path, then increased in altitude slightly and disappeared from view. No sound was associated with the object during the time it was under observation.

Subject: FLYOB?

In accordance with APL 200-2, dated 29 April 1952, subject visual flying objects observed by visual observers near Phoenix, Arizona were intervisually observed by the Airman Institute for Foreign Trends, Intelligence ARIZONA, who state the following:

On 25 May 1952, approximately 1830, various personnel stationed at the Phoenix, Arizona airport observed a number of small disc-shaped objects maneuvering silently with their discs visible near the horizon for over 12 to 15 minutes. These objects were observed by competent observers, to include tower operators at the airport, many of whom were familiar with various conventional aircraft but stated that they could not identify the objects as any known type of aircraft. Their movements were described as extremely fast and maneuverable, far exceeding the performance capabilities of any known type of aircraft. The objects were estimated to be approximately 200 miles per hour. Neither the size nor the altitude of the objects could be accurately determined. However, their general size was estimated to be between that of a piper cub and that of a C-47 aircraft. Their probable altitude was estimated at 5,000 to 10,000 feet.

The reliability of the observers is not questioned and they are considered to be competent and reliable. The object of the report observed in the Phoenix, Arizona, area, 25 May 1952, that was described and recorded as unidentified, the truth cannot be judged.
