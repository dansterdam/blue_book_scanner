1. On Tuesday, 22 April 1952 at approximately 2130 hours, a call was received from Capt. [redacted] of the 4673rd Ground Observer Squadron, Syracuse, New York. Capt. [redacted] advised that several objects from his area in Jamesville, New York, had been reported this information to the Chief Controller at the base immediately.

2. At no-north of the 4673rd GOS interviewed Prof. [redacted] on 22 April at Syracuse. The following information was obtained:

a. Objects were sighted on the nights of 19, 20, 21 and 22 April, south of Jamesville, New York, 5 miles south of Jamesville, New York.

b. Witnesses: 1. Prof. and Mrs. [redacted], Jamesville, NY
2. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted], Jamesville, NY
3. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted], Jamesville, New York

c. Dates and Times: First sighting 19 April 1952 at approximately 2330 hours by all witnesses in the south southeast.

Second sighting 20 April 1952 from 2200 to 2300 hours by all witnesses in the south.

Third sighting on 21 April 1952 from 2130 to 2300 hours by all witnesses in another west and west.

Fourth sighting on 22 April 1952 at 2130 hours. Objects hanging motionless and one object was sighted for a very short period.

d. Description of Objects: One object was sighted on 19 April, one on 20 April, one on 21 April and one on 22 April. Single objects were always a steady red light. Than a 4 colored ones of object, they were red and green. Regardless of direction or color, they were always sighted near the horizon.

Objects would hover at times then move, at times at tremendous speeds and at times very slowly, then hover again. With such description also seen described as a dot.

Prof. [redacted] was questioned to determine whether or not the objects were aircraft. This possibility was eliminated because no sound could be heard and the speed was too great. After this, the report was made to leave the Jamesville area during the

period of sightings but he served of the a-roach-
ing aircraft was already been told on an occa-
sion prior to this report that the objects in-
volved were making light patterns in the sky and
the objects sighted.

The intensity of the light varied each night, pro-
bably due to the weather.

Info was reluctant to estimate speeds or
distances. At the present time they are attempt-
ing to use information to determine the ap-
proximate distance.

On 28 May 1952, after an further information was re-
ceived, a college local in Syracuse, New York, contacted
Syracuse University, Mr. Goss, New York, and a
research chemist for the United Corporation an attempt to clarify
the reports and the following information was received.

Data men stated that they could not understand the reported sighte-
ings described above as we noted to the 4,875th test until they had reviewed
two broadcast with which they examined the object. They did acknowledge
evidence. Upon examination through a fixed transit, said objects were round,
spinning slightly, and illuminated as if by a light. Two movement and color as observed
in the above report. Could be attributed to the high
atmospheric conditions in the area involving turbulence of air current
and the planets astronomical position.

The preparing office check confirms for the size of the reported sighte-
ings and kind the weather conditions, 351 air division (Prov) records of
25,000 thin, broken clouds, winds 7 to 17 miles per hour, and visibility
excellent at the times given for the sightings.
