SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT

SUBJECT: Findings of Unconventional Airborne Objects, San Diego, California, during March 1952.

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

1. REPORT: Source of information, an experienced air observer, reports that during March 1952 in the San Diego, California, area, several unidentified aerial objects were sighted. Other members of a private club in San Diego have also reported seeing similar objects on various occasions. The objects are described as flying at extremely high speeds and altitudes, and performing maneuvers not characteristic of conventional aircraft. The objects are reported to be metallic in appearance, varying in size from approximately 30 to 50 feet in length. There is no discernible method of propulsion visible, and the objects leave no vapor trail. It is reported that the objects were observed by several reliable and competent observers over a period of several days.

2. DATA: Mr. _____ a civilian, residing at 2005 E. 16th Street, National City, California, advises that he is a member of a private aircraft owners' club in San Diego, California, and he has observed the objects described above on a number of occasions. The members of this club live in various points in and around San Diego, and they have reported to Mr. _____ that they have also observed similar objects on other occasions. Mr. _____ has submitted to this office reports along with various photographs, clippings, and other related data concerning his observations.

Included with the above are reports submitted by two other members of the same club, Messrs. _____ and _____, also residents of the National City, California, area, who corroborate the sightings made by Mr. _____ and other members of the club.

While driving my car east on 12th St., my wife and I observed what appeared to be a bright light.
By auto accident, my attention was called to this object in the sky, said, "What's that unusual looking thing?" I looked around in the sky and it appeared to be about the size of a basketball, self-luminous, and had the appearance of a very bright star, which cast a glow on the ground below it. The object was hovering, and then suddenly it made a very fast start, going in a southerly direction, and then stopped just as suddenly. This was repeated several times. Finally the object moved slowly eastward. The motion may have been due to the earth's rotation, that is it may have been stationary. I was unable to detect any sound connected with the object.
As far as I could determine, this was probably no more than a mile to the south of me. The size of the object was certainly not over that of a basketball, and the lumination was bright enough to cast a glow on the ground below it. The object did not appear to be anything known to me, and I have had considerable experience in observing celestial objects. The object was visible for approximately 25 minutes.
I am an aircraft mechanic and I have been trained to recognize aircraft identification, and I can state with confidence that this was not a known type of aircraft.
The above is a true statement.

The image appears to contain a detailed diagram or drawing related to a UFO sighting or report. The diagram shows various measurements, angles, and calculations related to a "red trail" observed at a certain location. It also includes information about the date, time, and location of the observation.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will now proceed to extract the text from the document:

The image contains a newspaper article with the headline "Hundreds See Fireball Flash Across S.D. Sky". The article describes reports of a "green fireball with a long tail" that was seen by hundreds of people in the San Diego, California area on the night of March 6, 1952. The article mentions that the Coast Guard, the Navy, and other organizations were investigating the incident, though they were unable to determine the exact nature and origin of the object.

The text in the document is as follows:

'GREEN WITH LONG TAIL'
Hundreds See Fireball
Flash Across S.D. Sky
Hundreds of startled San Diegans who reported seeing the phenomenon agreed it was a huge mass of green light, a fiery tail. It angled down toward the southwest and then appeared to burst out and go out, the observers said.
Rudolph M. Lippitt, secretary of the San Diego Astronomical Society, tentatively identified the object as "a giant meteor."
He said, "This was not a plane, not a rocket and not an atomic explosion. It was a huge fireball, green in color, with a tail like a comet. The Coast Guard and the Navy are also investigating it as a rare phenomenon."
Dr. Chester Sillwerinaia, State College astronomy professor, said it probably was a meteor.
He said "This could not be accurately determined without more information on its speed and altitude."
