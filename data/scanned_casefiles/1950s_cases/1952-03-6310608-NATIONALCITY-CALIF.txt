SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT

SUBJECT:   Findings of Unconventional Airborne Objects,
           San Diego, California, March to June 1952.

TO:        Director of Special Investigations
           Headquarters United States Air Force
           Washington 25, D. C.

1. SYNOPSIS: Source of information, an aeronautical engineer, 
San Diego, California, and associates residing in different localities 
in the San Diego area, have formed a "Flying Saucer Sighting Club". 
When an unidentified aerial object is sighted, other members are alerted 
for further identification, tracking, and triangulation. Source has 
qualified with various sketches and mathematical computations concerning 
sightings made during four month period, March to June 1952.

2. DETAILS: Mr. [redacted], residing at 2408 E. 16th Street, 
National City, California, employed as an engineer with the Consolidated-
Vultee Aircraft Corporation, San Diego, California, advises that he, 
along with several other engineers, has formed a voluntary "Flying 
Saucer Sighting Club". The members of this club live in various points 
in and around San Diego and its suburbs. According to [redacted], when one 
member sights an unidentified object in the sky, he immediately alerts 
other members of the club by telephone so that a triangulation and 
additional sightings can be made.

Mr. [redacted] has submitted to this office reports along with various mathematical computations covering sightings made by this group on 
2 March 1952, 9 May 1952, 13 May 1952, 21 May 1952 and 14 June 1952. 
ALL these sightings were made at night and concern meteor-like objects.

Included with the above are reports submitted by two of Mr. [redacted]'s colleagues, a Mr. [redacted], San Diego, California, and Mr. [redacted], San Diego, California. These reports contain the sighting of a [redacted] on 2 March 1952 at the [redacted] by Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] and a similar sighting on 9 May 1952 by Mr. [redacted] at the [redacted].

REPORT ON GREEN "UFO BALL"

Date: March 2, 1952
Place: National City, California
Time: Approximately 7:30 PM PST

While driving my car east on 19th St., my wife and I observed what appeared like lighting flashing and illuminating the surrounding ground, house, and trees with a green light.

My wife exclaimed, "Look, it's lightning!" I said, "Yes, that's unusual, look, it's green!" I looked around in the sky and saw through the windshield, by looking toward the shooting disc and looking up, a green ball of light. In 1:15, the ball was large as a house, and color was bright green. Even 2° by braking power, such as a sliding road in a slow plan, which was out of a street car trolley on a sleety night.

The outline of the object was sharp, not fuzzy. The light seemed to flicker, with darker areas causing it to appear within the green light, so that was observed about the object. Though the object was several hundred feet above ground, it was a trail. The object did not appear to be incandescent.

As far as I was able to determine, the object was either stationary or drifting slowly eastward. Its motion may have been due to the motion of the car. Inasmuch as the car windows were closed, and due to the sound of the engine, I was unable to detect any sound connected with the object.

The object appeared to be very close, probably no more than a mile to the horizon. I would estimate it was 150 to 200 feet above the horizon. This light did not fade out or glow hazy, but disappeared in nearly 1½ to 2 minutes. The object was approximately cylindrical in color, whitish orange, white's best. The Mr. at approximately 200 [redacted], San Diego, Calif., who estimated its location.

I am an aircraft design engineer for [redacted]. I have been convinced that this was not a "meteor" except in the sense that it was an aerial phenomenon. In my opinion the object was not falling, nor was it flying in the sense of a conventional aircraft. I believe that the explanation for this type of object lies outside the limits of our present knowledge and can not be explained by conventional means.

The above is a true statement.

'GREEN WITH LONG TAIL'

Hundreds See Fireball
Flash Across S. D. Sky

Hundreds of startled San Diegans saw a "green fireball with a long tail," believed to be a meteor, streaking through the sky south of here soon after 7:30 last night.

The Union, the Coast Guard station, Navy installations and the police were flooded with calls from curious residents in all sections of the metropolitan area.

Rudolph M. Lippert, secretary of the San Diego Astronomical Society, tentatively identified it as a large meteor. He said its greenish color.

The Coast Guard and Navy also tentatively evaluated it as a meteor.

The Coast Guard sent a helicopter aloft to investigate but it saw nothing unusual. Chester Silvernail, State College astronomy professor, said reports seemed to indicate that the fireball probably was a meteor.

He said this could not be accurately determined without reports of the direction of travel, speed and altitude.
