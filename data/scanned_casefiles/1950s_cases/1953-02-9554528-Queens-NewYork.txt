FILE NO: 24-526

DETAILS:

1. At 1245 hours on 23 February 1953, Special Agent LOUIS C. WENDERBERGER, this district, received information from Bayview, New York, alleging that he had observed an unidentified object in the air at approximately 0130 hours 23 February 1953 advised that he could be contacted at New York City.

AT NEW YORK, NEW YORK

2. On 24 February 1953, was interviewed at his office on the 16th floor of and furnished the following information concerning the unidentified flying object which he had observed previous day. The description of the object is as follows:

SHAPE - No recognizable shape was described, inasmuch as the object was considered to be merely a light, and considered circular because of its glare.

SIZE - Size of the object was estimated to be three (3) or four (4) times that of the star Polaris.

COLOR - Described the color as being an off-yellow with an orange tinge and very brilliant, about three (3) or four (4) times brighter than that of the star Polaris.

NUMBER - Only one object was observed

AERODYNAMIC FEATURES - Because of the fact that he only observed a light, could not describe any aerodynamic features, nor did he see any trail, exhaust, or propulsion system connected with this unidentified flying object.

SPEED - Did not know, nor could he estimate, the speed of the object. However, he did state that it appeared to travel at a very rapid rate.

SOUND - No sound was heard.

MANEUVERS - The object appeared to travel horizontally in very low area, covering approximately (60) degrees of angular traverse during the time that observed the object. These were very flat in trajectory and the object, in travelling through one arc, seemed to accelerate during the first half of the arc, then slowing during the last half of the trajectory. It appeared to momentarily hover and then start again on its acceleration to the apex, then decelerating to the point where it would again appear momentarily to hover. This maneuver appeared to occur four (4) or five (5) times. During these maneuvers the light did not change in size, appearance, color, or in any other way.

MANNER OF DISAPPEARANCE - stated that the light instantaneously disappeared at the end of the period of his observation. He carefully examined the area with his camera to see if there was any obstruction in his line of vision which could have caused the disappearance of the light and found none. It appeared as though the object had passed behind a layer of cloud.

3. The time of the observation was approximately

AT NEW YORK, NEW YORK (Cont'd)

(5) between 0120 and 0125 hours on 23 February 1953, and he observed the unidentified object approximately twelve (12) seconds.

[Redacted text] added that he had first observed the unidentified object from the corner of his eye while he was driving eastward on 29th Avenue in Bayside and had immediately stopped his car, dismounted, and stood outside to observe the object. The object does not wear glasses nor did he use any optical device to observe the object.

[Redacted text] stated that his location at the time of the observation was at the intersection of [redacted] and [redacted] in Bayside, Long Island, New York, which is estimated to be approximately 79 degrees 49 minutes west longitude and 40 degrees 47 minutes north latitude. This position is south of Port Totten, Long Island, New York. [Redacted text] estimated the object to be an altitude above the horizontal of between forty (40) to forty-five (45) degrees and its initial observation was a little to the south of an extension eastward of 29th Avenue. [Redacted text] then traversed approximately from (25) degrees north of due east and this would place the object approximately due east of the observer. [Redacted text] would not make an estimation of the distance of the object.

[Redacted text] stated that he was not able to draw an azimuth (or) six (6) degrees to right, or to the south, and maintained approximately constant altitude.

[Redacted text] stated that due to the time of the observation, he did not notice any other individuals in the vicinity who could be considered as witnesses of this event. Further [redacted] that he has had past experience in observing aircraft in flight, and also was well aware that something strange, and that this object did not resemble either of these and, therefore, that was why he felt it necessary to advise this office concerning his sighting.

[Redacted text] further stated that at the time of the sighting, the atmosphere was cool and, insofar as he knew, clear. No comment was made concerning the winds aloft at that time. Further stated that he had not observed any aircraft in flight in the area during the time when he observed this unidentified flying object.

7. [Redacted text] stated he is employed in the advertising branch of the Precision Department of True magazine, published by Fawcett Publishing Corporation. He stated that he had read the article concerning "Flying Saucers" published in True magazine, and that he was interested in determining the nature of these objects.
