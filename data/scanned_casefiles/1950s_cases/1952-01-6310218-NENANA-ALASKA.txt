8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
At approximately 1020Z, 22 Jan 52, ground radar site picked up an object traveling at estimated speed of 1920-2000 mph. The radar also lost the object and picked it up again at 1022Z. At 1202Z, F-94 a/c chased up a target and tried to locate it with negative results.

9. CONCLUSIONS:
1. Several targets were located the radar scope but objects were not seen visually.
2. It is believed that the various pick-ups on the radar were due to abnormal atmospheric conditions.

APPENDIX VII
Nenana, Alaska - 22 January 1952

1. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

At 10202 on 22 January 1952, a radar station at Murphy's Dome, Alaska, observed an unidentified radar return. The target was going away from the station on an azimuth of 210Â°, at a speed of about 1500 mph when first observed but appeared to reverse its direction and returned toward the station. The set was adjusted so that the target could be observed as it closed in on the station but after this change was made the target was again observed, however, at about its original location, and again going away from the station. Just before it faded, it appeared to be making a turn back toward the station.

At 10302 an F-94 was airborne to search for the object. At this time the object was going away from the station at a high rate of speed so the F-94 was told to orbit. About this time the ground station lost contact with the object but continued to track the F-94.

At about 11002 as the F-94 was approaching Nenana (near Fairbanks), the radar observer in the F-94 observed two targets, one faint and one bright. The aircraft was at 30,000 ft. and the target was at 25,000 ft. The targets crossed from right to left and appeared to be travelling slowly and as the F-94 approached the target a high rate of closure was indicated. The contact was lost at a range of 200 yards.

Approximately one hour later, again near Nenana, another contact was made by the F-94. In this instance the target was kept dead ahead and level. When the target was at a range of 200 yards, the pilot pulled up and the target was lost. The rate of closing during the run was 100 knots even though the F-94 had flaps down. No other contacts were made and the aircraft was released at 12102.

During the two airborne contacts the F-94 was being tracked by the ground station but the object was not being picked up.

The weather was clear but no visual sighting was made. On the same night, the same crew had visually identified a C-54, a C-47, and a small civilian aircraft from 300 to 500 yards. There were no clouds in the sky but it was a dark night.

No malfunctions were found in either radar set.

The set was adjusted to that the target could be observed as it closed in on the station but after this change was made the target was no longer observed. Seven minutes later (approximately 10302) the target was again observed, however at about its original location, and again going away from the station.

At approximately 1020Z, 22 January 1952, Radar Site F-2 made an original contact with an unusual target in the area of Nenana (Point "Jig"). The scope presented the target clearly but on a slant or 15Â° - 200 instead of perpendicular to radial, the normal manner of presentation. The speed was estimated at 1550 to 1500 knots.

At 1030Z, an F-94 (pilot, Lt G.E. Garrett; radar operator, Capt V.D. Ramey) was airborne and vectored to Nenana. F-2 lost the target prior to the aircraft's arrival in the vicinity, so the aircraft was given a patrol mission along the Alaskan Range.

At approximately 1052Z, F-2 again contacted this target and held it for about one (1) minute. Due to the fact that the target was outbound in relation to F-2 and to the aircraft and moving, at high rate of speed, no attempt was made to vector the aircraft on the target.

At approximately 1200Z, while the aircraft was en route to Ladd Air Force Base, the radar operator received indication of a target in the Nenana area. Finding the target ahead and low (approximately 24,000 feet to 200 yards) with a good intercept pass from 24,000 yards to 200 yards with a good target on the radar scopes. The overtaking speed was better than 100 knots.

At 200 yards the pilot pulled up and over the apparent target location. Aircraft speed on the run was approximately 250 knots indicated. After going over the target, two (2) 360Â° turns were made and a search of the area conducted for several minutes without making further radar contact or visual sighting.

During this time F-94 was able to track the F-94 but had no other target visible.

The F-94 landed at 1225Z. The weather in the Fairbanks area during this period - 1030Z to 1230Z, 22 January 1952 - was: ceiling unlimited, visibility 15 miles or more. The pilot reported that the Aurora Borealis was brilliant but not exceptionally so.

A pilot and ground observer reported what appeared to be a comet or meteor to the southeast of Ladd Air Force Base, approximately four (4) hours earlier, this data.

On 23 January 1952, from 1020Z to 1140Z, the same F-94 (pilot, Lt R.R. Diment; radar operator, Lt C.A. Hayward) was dispatched on a mission to search similar to that of 22 January could be found. At approximately 1050Z a radar contact was made at 20,000 yards, then at 18,000 feet in a shallow climb. An intercept run was begun and followed through to 2700 yards, at which time the target disappeared. The overtaking speed was more than 100 knots.

After radar contact was lost, further search was made in this area. Contact was not made either by radar or visual observation. The weather was clear, with visibility unlimited; the pilot reported that the Aurora Borealis was very active and in his opinion, unusual.

At approximately 1030W, 23 January 1952, a team checked the aircraft, utilized in these flights, for radiation, but with negative results. Due to the time lapse between the flight on 22 January and the time at which this check was made, it is possible that no results are stated.

Dr. G.T. Elvey, Director of the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska, stated, in effect, that in his opinion it is unlikely that a meteor would produce an indication on a radar set that is not specifically designed for such purposes.

the following hypotheses are advanced concerning the aforementioned radar targets:

1. That the energy transmitted from F-1 might have reflected from Mt. McKinley in such a manner as to create these radar targets.

Comments: Due to the frequencies and miles repetition frequencies of the radar sets involved (AF/CPS-5B at PAL and F-2, and the AF/APG-33 in the aircraft) it is highly improbable that this hypothesis is a valid one for technical reasons.

2. That ionized gases due to meteor activity might have produced these radar targets.

Comments: It is thought that the presence of a meteor southwest of Ladd Air Force Base at approximately 2000Z, 21 January 1952, might have been bearing on the subject. It is not considered likely, in view of Dr. Elvey's statement, that the meteor located could be a target return. There is the possibility that the ionized gases, which may have been present with the meteor's passage, might have broken into small clouds (irregular masses of ionized gas) and have been floating around in the upper air. One or more of these clouds, being at the energy of upper air currents, may have drifted into the area of Ladd Air Force Base. Further, the possibility exists that an ionized cloud may give a radar return of an aircraft near such clouds, such as happened when the fighter broke off the intercept on both MiGs, would tend to clarify the surrounding air in such a manner as to disperse the ionized cloud. This would tend to explain the arrest of F-2 to contact with the target after an intercept pass. The failure of F-2 to contact a target on 23 January 1952 is not explainable.

3. That the activity of the Aurora Borealis might have produced these radar targets.

Comments: Due to the known effect of the Aurora Borealis on radio in this theater, it is thought that some effect on radar also might be experienced. This is believed to be beyond the scientific capabilities of this Command to determine.
