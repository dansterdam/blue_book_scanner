BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
At approximately 1002Z, 22 JAN 52, ground control radar picked up an unidentified target. The target was observed on the radar scope at intervals for 2 min. The object was picked up several times, but each time it lost altitude and the radar operators could not lock on to it. It is believed that the various picks were not due to one distinct object, but rather to abnormal atmospheric conditions.

EXAMINATION 

SUBJECT: NENANA, ALASKA - UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
DATE: 17 JANUARY 1952 
LOCATION: NENANA, ALASKA
REPORT NO.: 6310218

On 17 January 1952 at approximately 2200, local time, a brilliant, steady light was observed in the sky over Nenana, Alaska, by a number of residents. The light was described as being very bright, circular in shape, and at an estimated altitude of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of about 30 minutes during which time it made several irregular movements, hovering at times, and at other times moving rapidly in various directions. No sound was heard and no trail was observed. The object eventually disappeared from view in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed.

APPENDIX VII
Nenana, Alaska - 22 January 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
At 10020Z on 22 January 1952, a radar station at Murphy's Dome, Alaska, observed an unidentified radar return. The target was going away from the station on an azimuth of 219° at a speed of about 1500 mph when first observed but appeared to reverse its direction and returned toward the station. The set was about to lose the target but after this change was made, the target appeared again and was observed a gain going away from the station. 

At 10202 an F-94 was airborne to search for the object. At this time the object was going away from the station at a high rate of speed so the F-94 was unable to close this distance but continued to track the F-94.

At about 1100Z the F-94 (while approaching Nenana, near Fairbanks), the radar observer in the F-94 observed two targets, one faint and one bright. The distance was 21,000 ft. and the bright target appeared to be traveling slowly and was the F-94. The contact was lost.

Approximately one hour later, again near Nenana, another contact was made by the F-94. In this instance the target was kept dead ahead and level. When this target was a range of 300 yards, the pilot pulled up and the target was lost. The rate of closure during the run was 100 knots even though the F-94 had flaps down. No other contacts were made and the aircraft was released at 1340Z.

During the two airborne contacts the F-94 was being tracked by the ground station but the object was not being picked up.

The weather at the time was very good. The moon was high and the sky was clear. On the same evening a few hours later, the same crew had visually identified a C-54 and a C-47 aircraft from 500 to 600 yards. There were no clouds in the sky but it was a dark night. 

No malfunctions were found in either radar set.

1. On 5 January 1952 at approximately 1645 hours, I observed a strange object in the sky approximately 15 to 20 miles south of Nenana, Alaska. At first I thought it might be a meteorite or a strange cloud formation, but after observing it for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, I realized that this was no ordinary object.
2. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and was emitting a bright blue-white light. It was traveling in a northwesterly direction at a high rate of speed, approximately 1000 to 1200 miles per hour.
3. The object seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 feet. It was visible for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from sight.
4. I am a registered guide and have spent many years in the Alaskan wilderness. I have never seen anything like this object before.

REPORTED BY: AIR FORCE RADAR INSTALLATION (UNIDENTIFIED)
INVESTIGATOR: C. A. MALONE, CAPTAIN, USAF, ACTING DISTRICT SUPERVISOR
BACKGROUND: AT APPROXIMATELY 1912 HOURS ON 29 NOVEMBER 1952, THE RADAR INSTALLATION LOCATED AT NENANA, ALASKA, DETECTED AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT ON ITS SCOPE. THE OBJECT WAS AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 12,000 FEET AND APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING AT A SPEED OF 700 KNOTS. SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE OF THE OBJECT AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE RADAR SCOPE.
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: THE OBJECT APPEARED AS A STATIONARY BRIGHT SPOT ON THE RADAR SCOPE, NOT VARYING IN INTENSITY. THERE WERE NO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE RETURN INDICATION ON THE SCOPE. THE OBJECT MAINTAINED A CONSTANT ALTITUDE AND SPEED THROUGHOUT THE OBSERVATION PERIOD. NO SOUND WAS DETECTED FROM THE OBJECT.
INVESTIGATION AND CONCLUSION: AFTER CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF THE RADAR DATA AND VISUAL OBSERVATIONS, IT IS THE OPINION OF THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER THAT THE OBJECT DETECTED WAS A METEOROLOGICAL BALLOON. THE OBJECT'S CONSTANT SPEED, ALTITUDE, AND LACK OF MANEUVERABILITY ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A WEATHER BALLOON. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED.

APPENDIX II
Nenana, Alaska - 22 January 1952

1. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
At 10202Z on 22 January 1952, a radar station at Murphy's Dome, Alaska, observed an unidentified radar return. The target was going away from the station on an azimuth of 210°, at a ground speed of about 1200 mph when first observed, but appeared to reverse its direction and returned toward the station. The set was adjusted so that the target could be observed in 5 minute intervals and it was observed to make a turn of approximately 180 degrees, and again going away from the station. Just before it faded, it appeared to be making a turn back toward the station.

At 1030Z an F-94 was airborne to search for the object. At this time the object was again being tracked by the radar station and the F-94 was in close proximity, but continued to track the F-94. 

At about 11002 as the F-94 was approaching Nenana (near Fairbanks), the radar observer in the F-94 observed the target, one faint and one bright. The aircraft was at 30,000 ft. and the target was at 25,000 ft. The targets appeared from the light to be a high speed above/below flight. One target was lost at a range of 200 yards.

Approximately one hour later, again near Nenana, another contact was made by the F-94. In this instance, the target was two bright spots and level. When the searchlight was turned on, the target was pulled up and the contact lost. The size of the object or objects was estimated to be 100 feet in diameter. During the encounter, the radar was inoperative through some unknown cause.

During the two airborne contacts the F-94 was being tracked by the ground station but the object was not being locked up.

The weather was clear but no visual sighting was made. On the same night, the same crew had visually identified a C-54 at 6-7,000 feet, and a small civilian aircraft from 300 to 500 yards. There were no clouds in the sky but it was a dark night.

No malfunctions were found in either radar set.

Intelligence Directorate, Hq AIG
15-1-52

At approximately 10202Z, 22 January 1952, Radar site P-2 made an original contact with an unidentified aircraft in the vicinity of Nenana, Alaska. The target clearly but on a plan of 183° at a distance of approx 3700 yards instead of P-2's normal radar scope and disappearance of target, the normal radar contact of 10,000 to 15,000 knots was lost.

At 10302Z an F-94 (pilot, Lt G.S. Garrett) radar operator, Capt V.D. Rainey was airborne and vectored to intercept. For a short time the aircraft was visible to the pilot, but because of the existing conditions no attack was made. The aircraft was a patrol mission along the Alaskan Range.

At approximately 10202Z when the aircraft was acquired by radar contact, it then commenced a violent evasive action and disappeared from the radar scope. After a chase of 1 1/2 minutes to aircraft and moving at a high rate of speed, no attempt was made to vector the aircraft.

At approximately 10202Z while the aircraft was en route to Ladd Air Force Base, the radar operator acquired an additional radar target ahead and low (approximately 24,000 feet altitude), the pilot made an intercept with this 20,000 yards the target at a good radar scope. During the tracking the target's speed was better than 1000 knots.

At 200 yards the pilot reported on visual over the apparent target location. Aircraft speed to the run was approximately 250 knots indicated. After passing over the target, without seeing anything further, radar contact or visual sighting, the pilot could not close on the target and the mission was abandoned.

During this time the F-94 had no other target visible. The F-94 landed at 12252Z. The weather in the Fairbanks area during this period was extremely cold, with the possibility of light visibility as much as 30°.

A pilot and a ground observer reported that appeared to be a comet or meteor to the immediate east of their position at approximately 10202Z.

On 23 January 1952, from 10202Z to 11102, the same F-94 (pilot, Lt R.R. Dement) made two separate intercept attempts but was unsuccessful to gain visual or radar contact. It was indicated that on 22 January 1952 radar contact was made to at approximately 10202Z, but because of the high speed (over 1700 knots) at which time the target disappeared. The overriding speed was more than 100 knots.

After radar contact was lost, a further search was made in this area. Contact was not made, either by radar or visual. The weather conditions unlimited; the pilot reports that the Aurora Borealis was very active and in his opinion hampered the tracking.

At approximately 10202Z, 23 January 1952, a test check on the aircraft utilizing its radar equipment, but with negative results, indicated that the radar set functioned normally. The failure of the radar contact cannot be explained or evaluated.

The pilot's comment that the speed of the aircraft he observed appears to be unusual and that in his opinion it was unlikely that a present time aircraft could obtain such a high rate of speed for any worthwhile purpose. UNCLASSIFIED.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officers:
The following hypotheses are advanced concerning the aforementioned radar targets:

1. That the energy transmitted from a F-51 might have reflected from Mt. McKinley in such a manner as to produce these targets. 
Comment: Due to the frequencies and the pulse repetition frequencies of the radar involved, it is felt that this hypothesis is not valid for technical reasons.

2. That ionized air masses due to auroral activity might have produced these radar targets.
Comment: The force field at approximately 30,000 to 50,000 feet could have produced these targets, as the auroral activity at the time was pronounced. There is the possibility of small clouds (irregular masses of ionized gas) and have been floating in the upper atmosphere. On some occasions, these ionized masses may have the capability of reflecting radar pulses.

3. That the activity of the Aurora Borealis might have produced these radar.
Comment: Due to the known effect of the Aurora Borealis on radio in this theater, it is thought that some form of interference beyond the scientific capabilities of this command to determine may be involved.
