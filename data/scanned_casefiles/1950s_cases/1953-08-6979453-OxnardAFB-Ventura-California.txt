At 2126 hours, 12 August, I was standing beside the Mobile Control Tower on the east end of Runway 26. While watching Captain Keane land in T-940 9594, I observed a light of undetermined origin across slightly in front of and above the airplane's line of flight. I estimate the light was travelling on a heading of 170° as its flight path was perpendicular to Runway 26.

By comparing the speed of the airplane (approximately 350 knots), I estimate the speed of the light to be about 500 knots, or possibly in excess of that figure.

It is impossible to judge the altitude of the light since I did not know its size, nor did I have any other object to aid in judging the size, shape or altitude.

I observed this light for approximately five (5) to eight (3) seconds.

The light was a yellowish-white in color and appeared to be maintaining a horizontal flight path.

SUMMARY: (Enter color number of report, time significance as final one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures of basic file. Begin list of reports on AF Form 112-Part II)

1. One unidentified object with magnitude and shape of other reported seas by four civilians and one Air Force officer observers, California, Cumulative total of 66 seconds within a time span from 2105 hours to 2125:03 hours on 12 August 1953.

2. Object fluctuated in flight and appeared three different times to four observers located on seaward side of public pier in Ventura, California and once to Air Force Radar Observer while standing on end of runway at Oxnard Air Force Base, California.

3. Color of object was white in three appearances and red in another. In the latter instance, observers reported who possible object close together, one white.

4. Altitude of object unknown. Sound, trail or exhaust not detected, propulsion system not determined.

5. Observers considered reliable. Three are engineers at Point Mugu Naval Air Missile Test Center and another a Civil Air Patrol Member. Air Force Condor Radar Observer at Oxnard Air Force Base.

6. Jet aircraft were in vicinity of observation area, but neither airway controllers nor GOC sites reported anything unusual.

7. The possibility that object might have been lights of F-94B Starfire was advanced to the observers, but they discounted theory due to total absence of sound on an unusually quiet evening and also the very audible sound of planes in the area soon after the observation.

OPINIONS OF Preparing Officer:

Evaluation of information is C-3 due to above average intelligence of observers and their highly factual report of the object allegedly observed.

Here is the text from the document:

1. Flying saucer from Oxnard, California, two miles west of building, Washington, made the following observation on 12 August 1953 while located on the second end of the Ventura Field:

a. At approximately 2105 hours, Pacific Daylight Time, a white light with the nose pointing to the west was sighted at an elevation of about 50°, 1 mile to the north west of building. The light was steady, not blurred, blinking or hazy.

b. The light moved to the north at a constant average elevation angle with small random fluctuations without definite periodicity.

c. When the light moved to what was judged to be the Constellation Cepheid, it stopped and moved to the south at the same 20° elevation. A red light was also observed very slightly above the white light.

d. The red light was steady and comparable to the white light in brightness. After traversing 90° of azimuth to the south, the light disappeared suddenly with an apparent increase in velocity.

e. The 90° of azimuth was traversed in 30 seconds; the movement to the north in 15 seconds.

f. At 2115 hours, the white light disappeared for 15 seconds at about the same azimuth and elevation of previous sighting to the north, it faded somewhat, gradually disappearing into or above a fog bank.

g. The white light was again seen at 2117 hours for about 60 seconds, controlled descent, arching, continued and disappeared. This was similar to a meteor's track.

h. No sound was audible during the arc quite with a very light offshore breeze. Occasionally, somewhat clarified glare over the area was noted.

i. The very audible and Mr. Millner's angular velocity was slow in comparison to the light's trajectory.

j. No outline of any object was observed though the area was partially illuminated by reflection of lights from a nearby baseball park in addition to those of moonlight.

2. Captain Jack Burton, Senior Rules Observer at Oxnard Air Force Base made the following observation while standing beside the Mobile Control Tower on the east end of the Runway 23:

a. A yellowish-white light of undetermined origin, maintaining a horizontal flight path, approximately 1.5 to 2 miles long, was observed moving slowly, roughly parallel to daylight line, and was observed for six to eight seconds.

b. The light was estimated to be traveling on a heading of 170°, perpendicular to the runway which headed 250°.

c. The speed of the light was estimated to be at least 500 knots at an undetermined altitude and disappeared suddenly.

Concluding or Preparing Officer:
This factual report advanced pertinent to the unidentified object are well-documented. Records by Capt. Copple indicate. The A/C that was seen cannot be questioned but it is entirely possible that the lights might have been those of an existing A-240 aircraft known to be in the vicinity at the time. However, the absence of a partially discernible theory along with the concrete flight path of the object.
