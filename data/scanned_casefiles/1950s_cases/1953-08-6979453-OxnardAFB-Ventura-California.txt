At 2146 hours, 12 August, I was standing beside the Mobile Control
Tower on the west end of Runway 26. While watching Captain Kemo land
in T-33 #5544, I observed a light of undetermined origin cross slightly
In front of and above the airplane’s line of flight. I estimate the
light was travelling on a heading of 170° as its flight path was
perpendicular to Runway 26.

By comparing the speed of the airplane (approximately 350 knots),
I estimate the speed of the light to be about 500 knots, or possibly in
excess of that figure.

It is impossible to judge the altitude of the light since I did not
know its size, nor did I have any other object to aid me in judging its
size, shape or altitude.

I observed this light for approximately five (5) to eight (3) seconds.

The light was a yellowish-white in color and appeared to be main-
taining a horizontal flight path.

Captain, USAF

SUMMARY. (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final comment paragraph. List indicators on lower left. Begin rest of report on AF form 112-Part II)
Unidentified objects with magnitude and sheer of size reported seen by four civilian and one Air Force officer off Ventura, California coast for an cumulative total of 66 seconds within a time span from 2105 hours to 2125 hours on 12 August 1953.
1. Objects illuminated in flight and appeared twice to some observers located on guard end of public pter in Ventura, California and once to an Air Force Radar Observer while standing on end of runway at Oxenrard Air Force Base, California.
2. Color of objects white in three appearances and red in another. In the latter instance, observers reported the possible objects close together, one red, one white.
3. Altitude of object unknown. Sound, trail or exhaust not detected, propulsion system not observed.
4. Observers considered reliable. Three are airmen at Point Mugu Naval Air Missile Test Center and another a Civil Air Patrol member. Air Force Officer is the Senior Radar Observer at Oxnard Air Force Base.
5. Jet aircraft were in vicinity of observation area, but neither aircrews nor GCI sites reported anything unusual.
6. The possibility that object might have been lights of F-94C Starfires was advanced to the observers, but they discounted theory due to total absence of soul on an usually quiet evening and also the very audible sound of planes in the area son after the observation.
    
    
COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Evaluation of information is C-3 due to above average intelligence of observers and their highly factual reports of the objects allegedly observed.

b.  The light was estimated to be travelling on a heading of 170°, parallel to the runway which headed 260°.

c. The speed of the light was estimated to be at least 500 knots at an undetermined altitude and disappeared suddenly.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
The factual reports advanced pertinent to the unidentified objects are well-documented accounts by highly capable individuals. The fact that the lights were seen cannot be questioned but it is entirely probable that the lights might have been those of an aircraft having its anti-collision lights inoperative at the time. However, the absence of sound partially discounts this theory along with the erratic flight path of the objects.
