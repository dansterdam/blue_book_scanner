The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a cover page for a document or file from Project Blue Book, dated around 1955 and related to an incident in Chicago, Illinois. The text on the image states "File 3381, about 1955, Chicago, Illinois, 1 photo".

The image appears to contain a handwritten sketch or diagram, but no actual photograph. The text in the image states "Photo - above 5' ears old" suggesting that a photograph was expected to be present, but the image does not contain one.
