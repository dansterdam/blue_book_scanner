This page from a Project Blue Book document contains two sketches, but no photographs. The larger sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and instructions for the viewer to imagine a point "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when it was first seen. The smaller sketch shows two positions, "A" and "B", to represent the object's position when it was first seen and when it was last seen.

Here is the text from the document:
