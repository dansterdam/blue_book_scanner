"FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
March 25, 1952

A Lieut. W. E. Eanett (PSYC) reported that, while doing airborne navigation work over Labrador, he and his copilot sighted a luminous object in the sky. This object appeared to be 20 to 30 feet in length, approximately one-half second. It appeared to be a long flash of light, and this lighting occurred over a period of approximately 30 seconds. The object was observed to be moving in a straight line at a very high speed. As soon as this lighting ceased, it disappeared completely, leaving no visible trail. The pilots believe that this object was not a meteor, shooting star, or any other normal heavenly body, as it did not have the characteristics of any of these. In their opinion, this was definitely an unidentified flying object."

SWORN STATEMENT
FOR OFFICIAL USE - JUNE 25 1952

I, Lieutenant Fred L. Rinker, was checking passes at the entrance to the installation at 1800 hours, 9 June 1952. At this time a local civilian employee, Mr. ------- (name deleted), came to the gate and stated that he had just seen an unidentified flying object. He said that he was checking the livestock, when he noticed a bright light in the sky. This light seemed to hover for a few seconds, then it took off at a very high speed, making a sharp vertical climb. Mr. ------- said that he was quite certain that this was not a conventional aircraft, because of the manner in which it moved. Before I could get inside to report the incident, however, when I saw Mr. -------, he stated that he had already reported it to the officer of the day.

The object appeared as a long, bright light in the sky and traveled in a straight, level path. It seemed to gain or visible mass as it passed from southwest to northeast. I can see no reason to doubt the sincerity of Mr. -------'s report. The time of the sighting was approximately 1730 hours, 9 June 1952.

In my experience in the U.S. Army Air Forces during the war, I have seen many types of aircraft, both conventional and unconventional. I can state that this was not a conventional aircraft of any type that I have ever seen. It appeared to me to be some type of unconventional flying object.

SHORT STATEMENT

June 25, 1952

This is a report concerning an observation made on June 26, 1952, approximately 100 miles northwest of Goose Bay, Labrador. At about 22:00 hours, local time, the Regional Filter Center at Goose Bay received reports of an unidentified flying object. The object was described as being oval-shaped, about the size of a C-47 aircraft, and emitting a bright light. This object was tracked on radar for over an hour and was observed visually by several people on the ground. The object at times appeared to be a very bright light, and at other times appeared to be blotting out the stars behind it. It made abrupt changes in direction and speed. At one point, the object appeared to split into two parts briefly before rejoining. The report states that this is a well-documented case and that the persons involved are considered reliable observers.

The text in the document is as follows:

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

On the 21th day of June 1952, an Inspector Jack J. Grunstem, an officer in the 5th Security Division, reported several objsets observed at altitude of 2,000 feet. 

The objects appeared to be of metallic construction and according to the inspector were traveling at extremely high speed, approximately 2,000 ft. per sec.

The inspector further reported that the objects were approximately 20 to 25 degrees in altitude and traveled in an east to west direction for a distance of approximately 30 to 45 degrees of arc.

The objects were first observed at 11:13 hours and were under continuous observation for a time period of approximately 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.

I have had a fair amount of experience in observing aircraft, and this sighting was not at all similar to any conventional aircraft that I know of, including jet or rocket propelled devices. The objects seemed to be traveling at a fantastic rate of speed, much faster than any known aircraft. They also appeared to change direction very rapidly, which is not characteristic of our present day aircraft. 

In conclusion it is my firm belief that the objects were not of this earth, but of some other origin. I am completely convinced that these were not any type of man-made device, but were of an unknown origin.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
JUNE 25, 1952

This report is submitted in accordance with instructions contained in letter dated April 28, 1952, from Colonel F. R. Skeen, Chief, Intelligence Division, USAF. The object was reported to have appeared over Labrador on June 8, 1952. The object was described as a silvery, disc-shaped object, approximately 25 feet in diameter, which hovered over a remote area of Labrador for approximately 10 minutes. The object then accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The ground observer, a U.S. Air Force enlisted man, was in a position to observe the object clearly. 

I do not believe it was any known type of aircraft. The performance characteristics of the object, as described, are beyond the capabilities of any known type of aircraft. The object exhibited a high degree of maneuverability and speed which cannot be duplicated by any aircraft under development at the present time.
