...approximately at 2130 hours M.S.T. on the evening of 24 June 1952, while on duty at my station on the radar scope, I noticed a phenomenon appearing from an easterly direction. I observed this phenomena for approximately one half second. It appeared to travel at a high rate of speed and disappeared for a moment and then reappeared. Then, at approximately the same time, I picked out like a light. The shape was not clear to me, but it seemed to be a long green flash of light. This sighting occurred at approximately 2100 hours M.S.T. My coordinates in observing this were approximately 210° N.S.T. years, therefore, I can positively state this was not an aircraft of any type, which I have observed in the past. It is, however, my opinion that this object was a green colored mass.

SWORN STATEMENT
FOR OFFICIAL USE
25 JUN 1952

I, Inspector Fred L. Miner, was checking gates at the White Sands gate when I looked up from a car to see a flame in the sky. It appeared, to be east N.E. traveling north. The light was bright and seemed to be a very bright one surrounding a flame. It was distinctly visible and seemed to be a flame about 5 seconds (approximately). I called the guard F.R. Hines. He walked up. The light was vanished at once. I asked the occupants of another car which one to go get. He noticed my doing, but he and his wife said they had not seen any object. I was near but back in front of them the light was brilliant. I came to have another look. At this time I presume it was some distance away. Before I could get inside to report the incident, a broadcast described a green lights, however, when I saw it did not seem to be green at all, but appeared to be a clear flame with just a yellowish tint.

The object appeared as a long streak in the sky and traveled in a straight 10° inclined position. It gave no sound or visible means of propulsion. I can not accurately estimate the speed of this object. It seemed about a 1 inch resolution. Then it disappeared 11 seemed to grow brighter and then completely go out.

In my three years experience in the U.S. Army Air Force during the past world war, I never witnessed a phenomena such as this. I definitely state that it was not an aircraft of the type which I have observed in the past. I think this may have been a meteor.

SWORN STATEMENT

June 25, 1952

I, 1st Sergeant Charles W. Foy, of the Protective Force Branch, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, Los Alamos, did on the night of June 23, 1952, approximately 2000 hours, observe a disc-shaped object approximately 100 ft. in diameter, observed in the west of the project area. The top of the near 3616 Gail Circular was in the west of the point near top of the near perimeter fence. I was approximately 1200 ft. away. The object was very bright and my first impression was that it could have been caused fire as electrical short in the west of the adjoining apartment. Due to the limited visibility, I can see no details, direction, etc., except that it did appear to be a green ball with orange tinted edges and trailing tail.

I have had experience in aircraft recognition while serving in the Air Force, and its cadet training program. It definitely was not a conventional aircraft. I can not definitely state the color, however, due to the color am inclined to hesitate to state that it was a meteor.

SHORT STATEMENT

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY GLF

I, Inspector Jack J. Charboneau, on the 24th day of June 1952, was assigned duty with Protective Force Branch, Security Division. At 2100 hours that date, from my station, I observed an unidentifiable phenomenon which appeared to be a meteor or similar object. It appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, approximately 2 to 3 miles in diameter, possibly one mass or reflection of the other) at approximately 2000 ft. and descending to earth at an approximate angle from 30 to 45 degrees of angle. From point of observation, it appeared a bearing of south-east to northwest and about 2 miles distance from this observer.

The elapsed time of observation was 10 seconds, during which I observed 2 round green balls, apparently the size of a beehive calls, and having a 15-20 foot red-orange tail. These calls seemed to be traveling at about 250-300 M.P.H. There was no sound that I could hear. But I was inside the station at the time. As I observed further, these were no tactics or maneuvers as it descended in a straight line and seemed to fade or burn out as it neared the earth - the tail or exhaust did the same.

I have had a fair amount of experience in observing aircraft, and in either case the object was not a conventional aerial object as I have previously imagined it might be. Possibly an astronomical object such as a meteor. This conclusion stems from the fact that it seemed to be traveling too slowly to be rocket or jet propelled.

In conclusion and summation to me, it was not an aircraft and was nothing that I have never before seen.

SUMMARY:
The following information was furnished this headquarters by the CO, 1932D AACS Squadrons, Goose Bay Airport, Goose Bay, Labrador, is a spot report, dated 26 June 1952, with times and dates noted in Civil Time and Dates.

1. On 24 June 1952 at approximately 2155T, aircraft G-54, AJ 2714 overhead ocean station vessel 41B attempting to contact an unidentified aircraft which was thirty five (35) miles south of 47B flying in a westerly direction.

2. Ocean station vessel 41B was unable to contact aircraft. Contact was attempted on 12N.5 frequencies, 6543 kilocycles and 3270 kilocycles.

3. Airman 1/0 Norman S. Barnes, AJ 13333329, 1932D AACS D/F operator called Goose Air Base control tower for information on aircraft in the area and received a negative reply.

4. Ocean station vessel 41B at 2155T was located at five six degrees, thirty minutes north, fifty one degrees, zero zero minutes west.

5. The reporting aircraft landed at 2350T, 24 June 1952, and the crew was queried for further information. The crew consisted of Major O. Jermyn, aircraft commander, Torbay, Major G. W. Rich, pilot, Torbay, Lt. R. K. Bayer, navigator, Goose Air Base, and Airman 1/0 J. G. Erickson, radio operator, Torbay.

6. The crew reported that ocean station vessel 41B had both aircraft targets on the scope at the same time approximately 80 miles northwest, the other radar target was 35 miles south of 47B. The crew of AJ 2714 stated that 41B attempted contact for fifteen minutes without success.

7. Three possibilities exist: (1) that the unidentified aircraft was not guarding the assigned frequencies; (2) that the aircraft was on a classified mission and maintaining strict radio silence; (3) that the aircraft was a friendly or unfriendly on a "Ferret" mission.

In accordance with AFL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBSRPT), the following report is submitted:

On 24 June 1952 at approximately 2100 MST, and from Los Alamos, New Mexico observed a strange object in the sky. This object appeared to be a blue-green ball of fire with a portruding red flame tail. It seemed to be east N.E. traveling west. The object made no sound and had no visible means of propulsion. The speed of the was about that of a 4 inch rocket. It traveled in a straight 10 degrees inclination position. When it disappeared, at 14 kilometers, it seemed to become brighter just before it faded or burned out. All observers stated that they had never witnessed such a phenomena before.

The reliability of the informants is considered good.
