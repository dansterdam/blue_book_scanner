AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Dir/Int Hq NEAC                                                  IR-17-51                     PAGE    2 OF 3

1. On 18 - 20 September 1951 three (3) B-36 type aircraft flew a training mission from Goose Air Base, Labrador, to Resolute NWT, Thule, Greenland, and return to Goose Air Base.

2. The following aircraft took part in the exercise:
   a. 44-92668 - Major Paul E. Gerhart, radar operator.
      Major Charles J. Cheever, navigator.

   b. 44-92866 - S/Sgt Donald E. Jenkins, ECM operator.

   c. 44-92061 - S/Sgt Doyt T. Larimore, ECM operator.

3. Individual reports are as follows:
   a. Major Paul E. Gerhart. At 180320Z radar interference was noticed on the radar scope which was finally determined to be an unidentified aircraft on a relatively bearing of 130 degrees and 28 NM from our aircraft. The position of our aircraft at the time was 61/13E 68°50N. There was very noticeable jamming at approximately 180120Z. (Our position 63/30N 70°10W) The anti-jam time was approximately 6 min. The crew was informed at this time that it looked as though the ship (aircraft) was being tracked. At 180435Z radar interference was coming from the side of our aircraft and covered 120 degrees on the radar scope. At the position given 74/40N 16 NM unidentified aircraft crossed over from the right side of our aircraft to the left side at 18,000 feet and at a speed estimated to be 30 knots. At 36 NE 2645. (Speed of B-36 was 228 knots according to navigator's log) Landing lights were not standard. Instead of having the usual red and green lights on the wing tips, all lights were white. It had twin flashing white lights.

   b. Major Charles J. Cheever. At 180320Z interference was picked up on the radar scope. "It was an aircraft at 130/28 (Relative bearing of 130 degrees and 28 NM from B-36), going away course (H) 300° at 180/35N the unidentified aircraft flew along side (right) then crossed over nose. Our position was 65/40N 71/40N at an altitude of 18,000 feet. It was in view (visual) for a short 20 minutes. All running lights were white. Major Cheever was unable to identify it. The aircraft passed (the B-36) rather fast on a grid heading of approximately 046 degrees. (34 degrees True). Our ground speed was 208 knots. At 180450Z the auto-pilot and APQ-24 radar set went out. The APQ-24 came back on after a few minutes.

   c. S/Sgt Donald E. Jenkins. B-36 No. 2066 departed Goose Air Base at 192200Z and route to Resolute, NWT. At 192225Z shifting, carrier wave type signals were picked up on the following frequencies: 867, 869, 821, 730, 715 and 730 mcs. At 192345Z very powerful signals were picked up on the following frequencies: 38 to 42 and 48 to 57 mcs. NOTHING FURTHER NOTED.

   d. S/Sgt Doyt T. Larimore. B-36 No. 2061 departed Goose Air Base at 192220Z en route to Resolute, NWT. At 192315Z a signal on frequency of 240 mcs was picked up. The "use of this signal was one (1) microsecond and continuous tracking" type was picked up on a frequency of 53 mcs. The pulse of this signal was one (1) microsecond; the cycle, 4260 OPS. From 200000Z until 220100Z signals were picked up on the following frequencies: 37.5, 41.5, 44, to 56, 58.3 and 39.5 to 92 mcs. At 200100Z an "image signal" was identified on a frequency of 180 mcs. At 200200Z a T-type signal was identified on a frequency of 240 mcs.

D.I./Lt Hq NEAC                                 IR-17-51

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. The possibility of a naval vessel with radar in the Hudson Straits is ruled out. With NORAD's return flight at AP-A-2, Raider set.

2. Frequencies in the 700-900 and 900 megacycle group are unexplainable since no radar stations, U.S. or Canadian, are known to exist in the area within range of the B-36.

3. There are no aircraft assigned to the NEAC area that have night lights as described in par 3a above, or fly at this altitude and airspeed indicated.

4. There is no IFF installed in aircraft of this command.

5. 243 mcs is a national emergency frequency.

6. It does not appear feasible for an enemy aircraft to make reconnaissance flights in the NEAC area with night lights on.

7. NEAC is unable to furnish further information as this Command has no ECM equipment or personnel.

8. It is understood that SAIC is sending two (2) RB-36 aircraft to Goose Air Base in an attempt to determine the possible source and explanation of this incident.
