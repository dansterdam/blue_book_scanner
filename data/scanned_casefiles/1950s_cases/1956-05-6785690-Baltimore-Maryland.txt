7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1 hr 30 mins

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one

9. COURSE: unknown

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
One object like a star with circle around it. Size of grapefruit. Color orange, object descended below horizon. Winds 270 dgr-290 dgr up to 80 knots. Initial observation 65 dgr elevation in ENE. Disappeared below horizon in ENE. Observation through small telescope.

11. COMMENTS:
Object viewed for 1Â½ hour through telescope. Was moving ENE or descending. Since observation did not change in azimuth, only in attitude from 065 dgr to the horizon winds to SE ruling out balloon. Motion contrary to astro observation in azimuth was correct. Insufficient data. (motion missing, confirmation of azimuth missing, changes in color motion & intensity missing)

12. CONCLUSIONS: [All checkboxes appear unchecked]
