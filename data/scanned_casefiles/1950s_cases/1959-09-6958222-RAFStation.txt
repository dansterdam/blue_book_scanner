FM EDINBURGH AIRPORT IND THAT AN AIRCRAFT WAS POSS UN THE VIC AT
THAT TIME PD THIS ACFT WAS A REG SCHED FLT FM LONDON TO EDINBURGH
CMM AND WAS APPROACHING THE FLD ON A EAST NORTHWEST HEADING PD BELIEVE
THE TWO ZERO THREE ZERO ZULU SIGHTING MIGHT POSS BE RESOLVED AS THIS
AIRCRAFT PD FURTHER INFO FROM THE EDINBURGH AIR TFC CONTROL REVEALS
NO FLT DUE AFTER TWO ZERO THREE ZERO ZULU TWO NINE SEP CURR THAT COULD
CONCIDE WITH THE TWO THREE ZERO ZERO ZULU TWO NINE SEP CURR SIGHTING

PD LOCAL RADAR STAS WERE ALSO QUERIED WITH NEG RESULTS PD WHEN EDINBURGH
AIRPORT WAS QUERIED CONCERNING ACFT SCHEDULED CMM WEA CMM ETC PD IT
WAS LEARNED THAT CAF AIRMAN HAD ALSO MADE A UFO SIGHTING TWO THREE ZERO
ZERO ZULU TWO NINE SEP CURR PD THIS AMN CMM AC ONE GIBEY CMM GERALD
CMM WAS AT THE EDINBURGH AIRPORT WHEN HE MADE THE SIGHTING PD INFO
RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCE REVEALS BASICALLY THE SAME INFO IN CLN
IN THE OTHER REPTS CLN ONE SLOW MOVING WHITE LIGHT AT ABOUT SEVEN FIVE
