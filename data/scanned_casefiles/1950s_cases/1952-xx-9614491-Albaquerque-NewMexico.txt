The text I can discern on this document is partially legible. At the top of the page, I can make out:

HEADQUARTERS
RECORDING CARD
Albuquerque, New Mexico

The rest of the text is too faint or blurry to confidently transcribe. The page appears to be a form or record card with multiple columns, but the specific details are not clear enough to read accurately.

At the bottom of the page, there is a form number that looks like "ATC FORM 164 JUL 52 P20" but I cannot be completely certain due to the image quality.

AF FORM 112-PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Wing Intelligence Office
525th Pilot Training Wing
Williams AFB, Chandler, Ariz.

REPORT NO.
PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

At a position 25 miles east of Albuquerque, N.M. at 1118
MST at 11,500 ft. 7 June 1952 Pilot and Co-Pilot of AF 8840
3-25 made the following observation.

An object, as described below, was observed simultaneously
by Pilot and Co-Pilot as it crossed the flight path of the B-25
from a point at approx. 2 o'clock relative to the aircraft nose
to a point at approx. 4 o'clock when it blocked from view by
the right wing of the aircraft.

The trajectory of the object was considered as flat or
diving, slightly and when observed appeared to be not more than
250-300 ft. from the aircraft. Its altitude was estimated as
11,000 ft. or slightly above.

The object appeared to be rectangular in shape with dimensions estimated to be 6' x 4' of metal construction, possibly
aluminum.

The above was reported to Kirtland Airways at Albuquerque
who advised that no weather balloons had been released by the
AFB or CAA since approx. 0800 that morning. Kirtland was
further advised by the pilot that a written report would be
submitted on landing at Williams AFB.
