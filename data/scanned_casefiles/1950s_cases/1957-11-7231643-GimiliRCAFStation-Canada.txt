Gimili RCAF Station
Canada
Radar contacts, 7 November 1957
Weather conditions at the time were - wind from 220 degrees at 30 knots, visibility 15 miles, ceiling 2000 feet, no precipitation.
At 2300Z a radar contact was detected about 15 miles northeast of the station. The contact moved rapidly to the southeast and then south, disappearing from the scope after about 3 minutes.
At 2307Z another contact appeared 20 miles northeast of the station, moving rapidly south and then southeast. This contact remained on the scope for about 4 minutes.
The radar operator described the targets as very strong, fast moving, and of circular shape. The targets gave the impression of being intelligently controlled. No aircraft were known to be in the area at the time.
