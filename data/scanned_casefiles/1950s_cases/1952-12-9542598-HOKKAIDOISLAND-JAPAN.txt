Object described by observer as set of rotating lights, counter clockwise, varying red, white & green. Object appeared to have two beam-like legs on top and one on bottom sides.

Source: Who in pilot of 5-46th Sq/Obs observed the object at 77,000' altitude then climbed to 87,000' which was same altitude of object.

When observer attempted intercepting, object pulled away & disappeared after approximately 30 seconds. Source is a reliable combat pilot who is an AF colonel.

Northern Honshu, 29 Dec 52, ATIC Document 110519

The following is a report of an aerial sighting on an unidentified flying object near Misawa, Japan at 1993L 29 Dec 52. The object was a brilliant light that changed in color from red to white and was seen by 2 crew members of a B-26 for approximately 5 to 7 minutes. The light appeared to be moving at a speed equivalent to approximately 40-70 nautical miles SW of the a/c. Object seemed to be descending slowly and moving in the clouds, finally disappearing.

Concurrent sightings from other US aircraft in the area of an unidentified light are as follows: 2 F-84's, 1 F-84 flying over Misawa AB, and 1 C-47, flying was an unidentified radar track that disappeared at 1857L 12 miles east of Misawa AB.

Comments of the 20th Weather Sq: Suggest some interesting planet and weather factors which well might explain a phenomena of this type. The planet Venus is at a maximum magnitude at this time of year, appearing well and very bright. The planet Mars is predominately red. Both planets assume approx the same relative position in December. From a great distance can very well appear to move in a circular motion due to the refraction effect of atmospheric conditions near the horizon.

CONTENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:

1. The source showed great presence of mind in the investigation of this unidentified object. There was a difference of 25 seconds. The source was able to pull away when the source said his two areas at the object. This was an unusual incident. The source was flying at 11,500 ft. with a northerly vector to observation by the subject. Assuming it existed. The fact that there were no full moon conditions several excellent incidents for distortion and reflection or performance of aircraft compass produces different reflections or variations.

The source of the object. The report was filed by A/3c Culver, who was accompanied by the source flying as F-84 and by a pilot of an F-84 as well as a 2nd Lt. This incident was considered significant. The disappearance of the object to the west is considered significant. On the first sighting the curve of pursuit was flow breaking. If so, this phenomenon a "stacking" of the moon off the windshield, it would have also great in the operative direction.

On the second pass, There was too many indications of the presence of something for the source's remarks to be considered an observation of nothing.

3. Ice clouds are common in the Northern area of Japan where these sightings were made. The clear nights, bright moon, and stars indicate possible light refractions through ice clouds.

4. The following extract from IR-1-53, 59th Air Division, Incl 1 indicates the possible refractive effects when viewing bright stars through binoculars (which also bears some correlation):

From statement by A/3c Culver: "On Dec 24, 1952, I was scanning the sky with binoculars, I noticed a star which seemed to change colors, size, and shape. It was not constant. While watching with binoculars, I found that by moving the binoculars up and down, the star would change size and color. I could make the star rotate vertically and horizontally and change colors. When I held the binoculars still, the star would change in color."

5. In all cases except the reported ground sightings, the object was reported as being to the West of the different observers which were in different locations. This indicates either a far-distant terrestrial object, or some celestial object, (or a combination of celestial light refraction by distant meteorological conditions).

6. D/I JAFE advances the following comment which could provide a possible explanation for this unusual sighting:

"The planet VENUS is at maximum magnitude at this time of year, appearing white and very bright. The planet MARS is predominantly red. Both planets spanning approximately the same relative position in December, and from a great distance could well appear to "Move" in a circular motion to the formation of fast of the atmosphere near the horizon."

"At 20 North Latitude on the night of December 29, 1952, VENUS at 1900/I was located at 24d azimuth at 30 above the horizon. Between 1900/I and 2100/I this planet moved from 24d Azn, at 30 elevation, to a 266° azimuth position at 5° elevation. This would explain any noticeable dip into the horizon."

1. Description of Object: Object was a brilliant light that appeared to change in color. Color appeared to change in a constant, regular pattern, taking approximately 5 seconds to complete a cycle from red to white to red again. The oscillation of one color by another was a gradual one, moving in a clockwise manner from top to bottom. Object showed both red and white during transition period.

2. Time of Sighting: At 1940I for about 15 minutes.

3. Manner of Observation: Visual, without optical aids from a F-94 aircraft at 20,000 feet at a speed of approximately 250 knots. Airborne radar unable to make contact.

4. Location of Observation: At time of sighting, aircraft was continuing over such 270°. Object was on a northerly of 250M at a substantial, but undetermined distance from the aircraft. Observers were the pilot and radar observer of an F-94 aircraft.

5. Identifying Information of Observers: Observers were a Senior Pilot, Captain, who had a combat veteran with 11 years rated experience and a Radar Observer with 10 months rated experience. Other both observers are members of a USAF unit still to be positively identified.

6. Weather: Clear to broken with tops at approximately 8,000 feet. Moon was all but visible over clouds. Winds 55-65 knots from 280° at 20,000 feet.

7. Clear Visibility Which Might Explain Sightings: There are numerous marine lights along the Honshu and Hokkaido coast adjacent to the Tsugaru Strait, one of which is a group occulting white and red sector lights at XBGM 0142.

8. Physical Evidence: Negative.

9. Intercept: Aircraft was under control of GCI on another mission so it did not attempt intercept.

10. Air Traffic: Other traffic in the general area included:
    a. One F-94 flying in Chitose area. Reported position at 1940I was 25 miles southeast of Chitose heading to Hakodate.
    b. One F-94 flying Misawa Air Base area. This aircraft also reported seeing unusual light.
    c. An unidentified radar track faded at 1857I 12 miles east of Chitose.
    d. One B-26 reported sighting of unusual light at 1959I while at XBGM 3214.

B/I Japan Air Defense Force Command:

Reference TR 4-52 and TR 5-52, 601st Air Base Wing.

Several missions, this headquarters, advises of no unusual naval activity in vicinity of sighting area which might tie in with this object sighting.

20th Weather Squadron suggest some interest by the plot and weather factors which will aid in analyzing the incident at Sapporo.

The planet VENUS is at maximum magnitude at - 1/2 to 3 times of year, appearing with so very bright. The planet MARS is radio-traceable. Both planets assume a very bright, the more realistic to be in a near constant position. A different color will serve to "move" in a circular motion due to the recession effect of atmospheric conditions near the horizon.

At 30° North Latitude on the night of 2 December 1952, VENUS at 1900H was located in an azimuth position of 240° at 30° above the horizon, between 130°I and 210° with 130° at 1200H this azimuth moved from 240° at 30° to a 260° at 1900H at 50° above the horizon. This movement could explain the entire visible tip into the horizon.

This phenomena could provide a possible explanation for this type of sighting.

STATEMENT

On 29 December 1952, I was the pilot of a night-scrambled F-94, orbiting
about 27,000 in a volume port over and north of Hokkaido Island, Japan. A
brilliant light which was apparently below the altitude of 20,000' where we were
flying. The light was unusual, both because of its intensity and because it was
constantly and regularly changing color from red to white. Therefore I rolled
out of my orbit and placed the light in line with my nose, taking a reading
heading from my slave gyro compass of 2550. Upon further observation, I decided
that the light was not moving or if it was, the movement was so great the error
was no apparent movement. From 1940 until about 1955, I then destined gave me a
vector of 90°, I observed the light and saw no break in the position or pattern
of the light pulsation. It was definitely not a flashing light, but rather one
which had a rythmic change of color from red to white to red, from top to bottom.
The color was either large enough or close enough that it didn't appear to twinkle to
a star like. The color change was only took place in a translation from top to
bottom, but appeared also to rotate in a clockwise direction. There were no other
lights at all in the vicinity of the reported light. In my opinion the light was
either on the ground or so far away it appeared to be on the ground.

We were making a tight orbit over Columb (XXXX 2726) at 20,000' awaiting a target when we noticed a bright light at 1 AO. The light appeared to be a ground beacon, but we were unable to ascertain an altitude of it due to a cloud layer below us. When first noticed it was though to be a star or planet, but the change of color was too definite. The 1st period at what appeared to be a constant position. The color of same was from red to white to red. The change was very regular, and seemed to be half red and half white at the same time. After we noted it we made a plane, I proceeded to take a heading on it. We rolled out of our port orbit, pointing the nose of the aircraft directly at the light. The magnitude, heading 2659. The light remained in view until we woke out of our orbit point to intercept a stranger coming from Louisville (XXXX 3948). When we lost the orbit our heading was 0900 and the time was 1925H.

Case #16
29 Dec 52
Hokkaido Island, Japan

A single flying object of unknown actual size was observed on 2 occasions; first sighting was at 1840 hours and lasted until 1950 hours (local time), second sighting commenced at 2000 hours and was terminated at 2005 hours (local time). At initial sighting observer was certain it was larger in body than any of the stars or other heavenly bodies. Since the pilot making the observation was flying a T-6A1 A/C at time, he was unable to note whether the object was accompanied by any sound. The means of propulsion was likewise unknown. First impression of description offered by observer was that this object appeared to be a cluster of lights rotating slowly in a counter-clockwise direction or from E to W. The object was terminal in its color effects.

Its body whose shape can only be assumed to be circular gave off three, red-white-green. These are the colors that gave the rotating color effect when sighted. This rotation was constant during both observations (totaling 12 minutes). The shifting of the 3 colors during their cycle of rotation was similar to the change in colors often seen in popular takes of juke-boxes. As these colors rotated in the body of the object, at times the entire body was 1 solid color, either white, red or green, but in the process of completing a revolution the body was frequently functionally red, white or white-green plus the other possible combinations of the 3 colors. Beyond the prominence of the colors common to the body, (possibly the center of the body) the most prominent item of description appeared to be the 3 beams of light that worked from the body outward in straight shafts of white light. The 3 beams never changed their relative positions, and actually were located at about 11 o'clock, 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock. These white beams did not swirl around as searchlights would, but maintained their constant position on the object. Very much like 2 legs on the lower portion, with 1 remaining tip displaced on the top of the object to a point approximately 11 o'clock. It is possible that the two lower legs could have been a bit high on the bottom side of the body, say at the 4:30

1. Description of Object: Object was a light similar to a brilliant planet except that it apparently changed in color from red to white to light green and then revolved with irregular motion. The color change followed a continuous regular pattern with each color period lasting for approximately 3 seconds, followed by a one second transition period in which the colors appeared to blend before the next color appeared. Object appeared to be more than 10 miles at an approximate level with the ground. Altitude of object was approximately 20,000 feet. At about the color of the light, object apparently changed the motion of the object did not appear to vary during the 3 minutes observation period. Observed was a middle to dark area of object. Aircraft lost sight of object as approximately 40x30/50 when object appeared to sink in with a background of haze.

2. Time of Sighting: Initial sighting took place at approximately 1517, but aircraft was on another mission and only noticed object intermittently until 1541. From 1541 until visual contact was lost at 1557, no forward forward motion was observed on object.

3. Manner of Observation: Visual without optical aid from a B-26 aircraft at 20,000 feet at a speed of 250 knots. Airborne radar unable to make contact.

4. Location of Observer: At the beginning of the sighting, aircraft was at approximately 40°N, 150°E. On first flight on squadron rotation from aircraft, but was two distinct mission assigned missions to key particular aircraft to 40°N, 150°E. Object all initially reported in a small area while aircraft flew search pattern in 25 mil of cross. After discontinuing search at 1541, aircraft was approximately 25 miles in an area of 1500M from Otinsk, hewing to Kilawa. The object, on a bearing of 2500M, was observed by both pilot and radar operator.

5. Identification Information on Observers: Observers were a 1st Lt. pilot with 10 combat rated experiences as a pilot and 7 years experience as a Radar Observer/Technician, and a 2nd Lt. Radar Observer with 7 months rated experience. Since both observers are members of a transient unit their reliability cannot be adequately determined.

6. Weather: Clear to scattered with a few broken clouds north of the Tangarl area. Tops approximately 7,000 feet. There was a full moon and visibility was estimated above clouds. Visibility was 55 to 65 knots from 250°.

7. Other Activity: High altitude activity in the area: There were numerous marine lights in the area, with no notable significant activity, one of which is a green reddish white and red sector light at approximately 1013.

8. Physical Evidence: None

9. Interception: Aircraft was low on fuel at completion of search mission and unable to attempt interception.

Naval liaison, this headquarters, saw no unusual naval activity in
vicinity of sighting area which might tie in with this object sighting.

208th Weather Squadron enroute some interest a plot not weather factors
which a flight well explain a phenomena incident this sight.

The planet VE-13 is at accurate position at this time of year, appearing
white and very bright. The visual (AIS) magnitude was 6.0. Approximately
the same relative position rate 1 Dec this year, and from a great distance
could very well be seen from this point. This is due to the great effect
of atmospheric conditions near the horizon.

At 300 north lat wide on the night of 2 Dec 1952, at 1200T
was located in an azimuth position of 2400 at 300 between 1800T
and 2100T this planet moved from 2400 to 200 to a 300 at mid position at 50 above
the horizon. This movement could be 1/2in the visible sky into the horizon.

This phenomena could provide a possible explanation for this type of
sighting.

I was the pilot on the F-94, and 2nd Lt. Radford O. Haddy was my radar observer on a scramble from Misawa Air Base, Japan, at 1821 on 29 December 1952, to view vectored to the Chitose Air Base area for an unidentified ground radar track. When we arrived in the Chitose Air Base area the ground radar track had faded, and we were requested to contact GCI. There was considerable aircraft traffic. Chitose tower reported no aircraft traffic, but were obtaining visual observations on two unidentified objects which were described as flashing horizontal red and vertical green. These objects were estimated southeast, and were of Chitose Air Base at a range of 36 miles and altitude of 5000' to 10,000'. We were requested by GCI to institute a search for these objects at 1915, and we did so in a rectangular area some 25 x 50 miles. We made no observations in the designated area, but did notice a very bright object in the west, slightly above the horizon, that remained a plane. This object had a reddish color above, varying from a reddish color to a white color to a greenish color in regular sequence. The main reason my attention was attracted to this object, which I had considered to be a plane, was its relatively bright appearance.

I again contacted Chitose tower requesting further information on their sightings, but the tower again gave the same report, definitely placing their sightings in the west and southwest. I continued my search for primary objects, without visual or radar contact, until 1944 when I reached my minimum fuel. At that time, because of the Kawi passage (close to the west to the object of my search), I took a bearing on the object and reported it to GCI.

I was approximately 25 miles from Chitose Air Base at the time (1947) on a magnetic bearing of 3500 to the base, and the magnetic bearing to the object was 2500. I was unable to estimate the range. At the time the object was 15 nautical mile range of our aircraft radar equipment, but the object appeared level with my altitude of 20,000', slightly above the horizon. It was the same bearing with my altitude of 20,000', slightly reddish to white to greenish, the individual colors lasting about 2 seconds, and the transition between colors lasting about 2 seconds.

At that time I was proceeding to Misawa Air Base on a magnetic heading of 215° at 20,000', and observed the object at its same relative position until 1953. At that time I spent approximately 15 seconds checking the object, which I checked for the object again, i.e. that time, it was not in sight and I was unable to reestablish visual contact. At 1954, I landed at Misawa at 2020L.

I was the Radar Observer on the F-94 which sighted unusual lights 20 December 1952, after contacting Chitose Tower at 1941 we searched the area east of Chitose for reported flashing red horizontal and green vertical lights. In found nothing in this area over visual by my radar. During this entire search we had noticed what appeared to be an obvious planet in the west. We were cautioned to return to Misawa AB local GCI at approximately 1944. At this time we noticed this light in the west and thought possibly it might have been what the Chitose tower saw as a flashing red and white or green light. Its appearance except for the color, it was a bright light changing red to white to pale green at about our same altitude. Without we at the time 20,000'. We reported this to GCI and took magnetic bearings with our aircraft. We determined we were 25 miles from Chitose on a magnetic bearing of 330 and this object was on a magnetic bearing of 250 from us. We observed this light for 11 minutes and there was no apparent change in its size and color. We were unable to investigate due to low fuel. At 1951 the lights appeared to fade below the clouds and that was our last contact with it. We could not estimate any distance except that it was more than 15 miles from us. Our radar would have picked it up had it been closer. It appeared to be a planet but the changing of colors and the Chitose tower report of unusual lights provoke an unusual observation of this light.

1. Description of Object: Was a brilliant light that underwent a continuous change in color from red to white to red. During transition period was one color to another, one observer saw quick flashes of white, blue and red phases. The white and red phases were particularly intense. The light appeared to be moving at a speed approximately 4-5 nautical miles 67 of aircraft. Object seemed to be descending, slowly and moving to west, finally disappearing in clouds. No means of propulsion, exhaust trail, or condensation trail noted.

2. Time of Sighting: Approximately 1937? for five to seven minutes.

3. Number of Observation: Visual sighting optical aid from a B-26 aircraft at 10,500 feet at a speed of approximately 250 knots.

4. Location of Occurrence: At the beginning of the sighting, aircraft was at approximately 38°N, 140°E, which was on a course of 255°M and expected to be at 10,000 feet altitude. Object seemed to be over the Tsugaru Strait. Both observers were in the cockpit of the B-26 which was flying a heading of 190°M.

5. Manifesting Information on Observers: Observers were two pilots, both Major and Captain rank, on a B-26 aircraft. Observers were along on the flight and only a sketch log was kept. Both were experienced, then ending positions are therefore approximate.

6. Weather: Clear to broken with tops at approximately 8,000 feet. Bright moonlit and with limited adverse cloud. Winds approximately 55 knots from 230°.

7. Other Activity Which Might Explain Sighting: There are numerous lights along the main island of Hokkaido near Chitose. In the Tsugaru Strait, one of which is a group occluding white and red sector light at MGH 0147.

8. Physical Evidence: None.

9. Interception: Flying ADX mission, no attempt made to intercept.

10. Air Traffic: Other traffic in the general area included:

(1) One F-94 aircraft which also reported an unusual light. Aircraft was flying in Chitose area and at 1944M was approximately 25 miles SE Chitose having toward Misawa.

(2) One F-94 aircraft orbiting area NNW 2527. Crew reported unusual lights sighted from this position at 1940M.

(3) One F-94 aircraft flying "Isawa Air Base Sea". This aircraft also reported unusual light.

(4) There was an unidentified radar track that disappeared at 1557M 12 miles east of Chitose.

Naval Liaison, 5th headquarters, advises of no unusual naval activity in vicinity of sighting area which might tie in with this object sighting.

20th Weather Squadron suggest some interesting planet and weather factors which might well explain a phenomena incident to this sighting.

The planet VENUS is a maximum magnitude at this time of year, operating with an very bright. The planet MARS is approximately 180 degrees from the same approximate relative position into December, and from a great distance could very well appear to "move" in a circular motion due to the refraction effect of atmospheric conditions near the horizon.

At 30° North Latitude on the night of 29 December 1952, VENUS was located in an azimuth position of 240° at 1900 hours and 210° at 2100 hours. Between 1900 and 2100° this planet moved from 240° to a 260° azimuth position at 50 above the horizon. This movement could explain the noticeable dip into the horizon.

This phenomena could provide a possible explanation for this type of sighting.

I was pilot of B-25 call sign Fincher "W" the night of 29 December 1952. 
Inbound to Miawa on a scheduled bombing mission at 10,700 Ft. I saw a brilliant 
white light just above my altitude approximately 10 miles away 290° to the right of 
my course (1500 N). At the time was over the coast of Hokkaido between 
Twam Chitose and Misawa. The light was large and brilliant, changing color from 
white to deep red, and appeared to be moving west. We observed the light for 
approximately 7 minutes before it disappeared, seeming to drop into the clouds.

and 7:30 clock positions. The observer recalls that the upper beam located just off the center appeared to be exactly opposite the lower right beam and established a one-way balance for effect. The object at no time executed any violent maneuvers, except for an almost gradual change of direction during the 2 observations. The observer attempted to estimated the speed of each revolution of the 3 color series in the body, and saw it is loosely estimated at 4 to 3 seconds. There was no jet exhaust noticed during either observation.

Both sightings were made visually by the pilot of an F-84-G a/c. Subject pilot was engaged in local area night flying. His first observation was made while he was at 27,000' altitude; the object stayed in his view while he climbed to 35,000' - at which point he was level with it. His second sighting of the object was also at 35,000' altitude. During one period, the pilot's airspeed indicator was exhibiting 330 knots, resulting in a true air speed of 458 knots and true ground speed of 412 knots.

The observer's position at the time of initial sighting was 40 deg 57 min 15 sec N, 141 deg 23 min 15 sec E. He was flying a mag heading of 010 deg at an altitude of 27,000'. At this sighting the object was higher than the observer at 9 o'clock position which was almost due west from him, traveling on a parallel course due north. He lost sight of the object at approximately 41 deg 32 min N - 140 deg 30 min E some 7 minutes after seeing it.

The source caught sight of the object for the second time just 5 minutes after losing sight of it. This was at 2000 hrs I time and the source was still at 35,000' altitude, but heading SE on magnetic heading of 160 deg. During this second sighting, the object was still at the same altitude level as the F-84 pilot, but it appeared approximately 30 deg off to the right of the F-84's nose - distance still unknown.

The general area of these sighting was extreme northern portion of Island of Honahu, Japan.

STATEMENT

At approximately 1940L on the night of 29 December 1952, I was flying on a heading of 1900 enroute back to Misawa from Hokkaido. My altitude was 10,000 feet. I was flying in the easterly course at 0-125 kts with our pilot as pilot. We were approximately 14 nautical miles from Chitose-machi, due north, when we spotted an object approximately 50-70 miles west of us at about our same altitude and what looked to be a parallel course to our B-26. It, the object, had a bright red light showing and all of a sudden switched to a white light. This alternating took place several times before the object disappeared. In intercepted radio from an F-94 flying in the vicinity of the object but do not know whether the pilot intercepted the object or not. Nothing was distinguishable about the object except the lights. No witnesses other than the pilot observed. Neither at the time was work on cold overcast, but visibility was unlimited at 10,000 feet. Our assigned altitude, we completed our tracking mission and participated in one intercepted problem before landing at 22/51. The incident was reported to the interrogator upon landing.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

D/I, 36th Air Division, AFO 919 11-1-53

STATEMENT

I was on duty in the control tower, O'those Air Base, 25 December 1952, at 1250I hours. Upon receiving a call from Sgt. Aramae, who was to the northwest and east for an object approaching Chitose at a fast rate of speed, I went to the window which changed colors, and was able to rotate vertically. It would rotate in a vertical manner, and then tilt to an angle of approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. Within this time, I noticed an object directly west of Chitose, fairly, and would turn around. It appeared to be rotating horizontally, and would also rotate vertically. It would rotate in a vertical manner, and then tilt back up to vertical position. When I first saw the object it was dim, then became bright, and then turned an angle approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. The object was on an angle of approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. I could not define the distance. I noticed a second object of the same type about fifteen minutes after seeing the first object. I motioned a second object of the same type about fifteen minutes after seeing the first object. I motioned a second object above the horizon. I estimated the distance to be fifty miles. The same applies to this object as to the first and second objects.

At 2000I hours, I observed a third object of the same type northwest of the station at low altitude. Its was not bright, but appeared to be close. Because of clouds I was only able to observe this object for about thirty minutes. The same applied to this object as to the first and second objects.

The weather conditions were as follows: 3,000 scattered; 2,000 scattered. The ground visibility was six miles with fog to the southeast. From the tower the visibility was unlimited, and the sky about clear. There were no clouds near as possible conditions in the area which I observed the objects.

I carried on a conversation with the pilot of the P-96, whose call sign was Calder 42. The gist of the conversation was as follows: "Resolved to his that we could over come or take any action." I was unable to get a seal that is all.

The Dyer-Fox unit in the tower was tuned into Able channel, and the following reports were heard: One P-96 reported that he had an object parallel to him, and three miles west of his, and that he changed color, ran and green. One reported that he had an object 500 feet above him.

Sportily after 2000I hours, I observed a white flash going toward the ground. It was east of the control tower. A wall of green was near.

On December 31, 1952, at 0320I hours, I was again the sky with binoculars. I noticed a star which seemed to change colors, with white, and green. I passed over it with the binoculars. Upon examining I found that by moving the binoculars, the star would move vertically and horizontally, and change colors; red, white and green. Then I held the binoculars still and the star was stationary, and white in color. I do not believe this was an object or objects which I observed on 29 December 1952. I could not get this object from the same area, one was northwest 50 degrees above the horizon, and the other was southwest on an angle of approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.

STATEMENT

I went up to the tower and listened to the conversation between the B-29 pilot and the control tower. The pilot said that he was an object some 34,000 feet. Two minutes later the tower called it to his altitude. He replied 34,000 feet. A few minutes later he said that he was 500 feet above the object. The object had bright red and green lights flashing. Approx an 8-10 thirty seconds later, the pilot stated that he was looking at the object. He was approximately 5 miles northwest of Chitose, and was turning smaller and going to the north.

I did not hear the remainder of the pilot's conversation on approximately 19:01 hours, 29 December 1952.

It looked like a star with a red and green flicker. It appeared as a planet. (Venus) It did not move in a vertical or lateral path. This is not the same object that the B-29 was chasing. I did not see object, but the B-29 was very close.

The weather conditions were clear and visibility unrestricted. There were no clouds in the air.

The object that I observed seemed to be in the east-south-east. I can not tell whether the object was to be a traffic object or whether the object appeared to rotate.

STATEMENT

The following is my own eye witness account of an unidentified object seen
in the sky above Chitose Auxiliary Air Base on the night of 29 December 1952.
At 1930A on the 29th of Dec 1952, I was on duty as Asst Operations, or for-
ward my usual duties. The "Sgt" line from Misawa ADCC rang and the I.D. was there
with me. I was informed of an unidentified target southwest of the station, tracking
an unidentified target southwest of the station, approximately 30 miles from our
base heading directly in to us. I informed him that no aircraft existed to my
knowledge, but I would check tower.

I called A/3c Callaway, the tower operator on duty, and asked him if they had
any aircraft working. He said, "No". I informed ADCC of this. ADCC asked if
tower would keep an eye open for an aircraft.

A few minutes later Callaway can't and said he was seeing a very strange
sight. He requested that the A.O. and myself come to the tower and look at it.
The A.O. Lt. Simms, and I went to the tower and using binoculars, we looked
at this object. Of quick look it was a star, but using the glasses and getting a
steady view of it, we saw it was flashing red and green.

I studied it for a full minute. My impression was that it resembled a ferris
wheel with a great many red and green lights. The object was rotating vertically at
this time. (A my aerial look of few minutes later the object seemed to slip on a
150 angle with the high side pointing north. It continued in this manner for the
rest of the time I viewed it. At one time I personally thought it moved down, a
sort of dropping movement, but I may have been wrong for no such sign was moved.

The night was clear with a visibility of at least 10 miles. The temperature was
about 30° Farenheit. A small wind was noticeable.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

D/I, 39th Air Division, APO 919                IR-1-53

STATEMENT

On 20 December 1952, I received a call from W-1. They had an object on the radar scope heading directly for Chitose approximately 70 miles south. The base alerted it to be a jet type aircraft. We went outside the tower and with the naked eye it appeared to be a flashing star. But with the glasses, it had a silvery metallic rod and green light.

We notified W-1 of it and they arrived at us to direct the aircraft to be checked. In the meantime, an officer and he "floored" us back. About five minutes later the aircraft asked us if we could give any other information. We advised his the object was still there and he "floored" us back.

At 8:15 there were observed another object which appeared to be brighter. It appeared to be 30 degrees vertical from the surface. This also appeared to be A/3c Callaway mentioned. At 8:20 we saw another object. The first two objects did not move until about 10:51, then the clouds covered them. The third object did not move, but another then finally vanished and then the clouds covered it. We could not tell the distance.

The weather conditions were the same as A/3c Callaway mentioned. One was to the northeast about 200 feet above ground. It did not move for about fifteen minutes. It gave off a red and green light. I had followed it about fifteen minutes when it began to look like a flashing light. About one earth ago we had observed objects that were not reported.

In the northeast about 200 feet above ground, I thought I saw an aircraft on base leg. It did not move for about fifteen minutes. It gave off a red and green light. I had followed it about fifteen minutes when it began to look like a flashing light. It appeared to be the east at a very high altitude; although I had observed it for about fifteen minutes, I did not know whether I thought it to be a star. About a week later, I saw an object that appeared to be the same to the east at a very high altitude, moving up from the surface. It did not move, but gave off the red and green light.

Referring back to the incident on the 20th of December 1952, the aircraft was 34,000 feet, and I heard him mention the word "flicker". I can not describe the object because it was too small. It was more or less just a flashing ray.

STATEMENT

On 29 December 1952, while serving as AO at Chitose Air Force Base, I went to the operational tower of that base. Prior to going to the tower, Col had requested various witnesses. I was informed that no aircraft had remained in the vicinity so whether or not we had any aircraft flying southwest in that area. There was no aircraft in the area from this installation.

The Chitose tower attempted to contact aircraft by VHF, with a negative result. The tower operator said by attached information on board, which appeared to be a star. The object was east-northeast of the tower. I observed this object through night glasses and it appeared to have a very rapid color change. The colors were quite vivid. The colors were red, green and white. While I observed the object, it did not appear to travel either laterally or vertically, I could not estimate the distance nor the altitude.

The existing weather conditions at the time of my observation were as follows: Ceiling virtually unlimited, no clouds. The temperature at ground level was approximately 19 degrees Fahrenheit. After observing this object from the tower, I left the ground without glasses, as object which appeared to be a shooting star traveling from north to south, appeared to be a shooting star traveling northwest. The second object left a trail. The original trail first appeared to be a vertical plume with all terrestrial red, white, and green lights visible. After a few minutes of observation, the trail became color-wise. After observing the object for a few minutes longer, it appeared to tilt to the left approximately 45 degrees. I did not see the object still, but did observe it in both positions.

Time: 1930I to 2005I; 29 December 1952.

CASE #26 (cont - page 3)

The pilot reporting these sightings is a colonel possessing long experience in World War II and the Korean Theater. Source has held responsible command assignments for some time and presently commands a Fighter Escort Wing operating under the 5th Japan Air Defense Force. The accuracy of source's statements was consistent despite revealing the interrogation, his sequence of times, locations and descriptions did not vary at any time. Source is stable and thoroughly reliable.

The area in which the sightings were made had the following weather conditions at 1730 hrs (low local time). 10/10 overcast, from 6 to 10,000' - brilliant moonlight and visibility of minimum to miles; temperature at 35,000' was 46 deg, pressure 210 millibars. Winds aloft reported by Misawa Weather Station were as follows: 37,000' from 250 deg at 50 knots/35,000' from 260 deg at 40 knots, and at 33,000' from 270 deg at 200 knots.

The pilot of this a/c was originally put on his guard to be watchful for something unusual, by virtue of hearing a radio-telephone transmission from an a/c calling a radar station on the ground.

The forenight of the source exhibited when he extinguished all the lights on his a/c, coupled with his persistency in being accurate in reviewing the details of his sighting result in a graphic description of an "object" normally falling into the family of "unconventional flying object". The source's experience and past actions demand attention to this sequence of sightings. This pilot was thoroughly versed in the limitations of flying machines; his attempt to garner all the pertinent information concerning this unknown item was definitely genuine. His ability to reconstruct all the factors common to these sightings was excellent and well organized.

ATIC Comment:
The tone of this report is very much similar to previous sightings of the planet Jupiter. Although this object is not Jupiter, it is felt that the very pilot that might be capable of misidentifying a celestial body and possibly the planet...

DEC. 29, 1952 NORTHERN JAPAN                    (KEYHOE-1953 P 190) 6 WITNESSES

AT ABOUT 7:30 P.M. AN AIR FORCE RADAR BASE IN NORTHERN JAPAN RECEIVED A

CALL FROM A B-26 CREW.
*WE'VE JUST SIGHTED A UFO. IT LOOKS LIKE A CLUSTER OF LIGHTS -- RED, WHITE
AND GREEN.*

MOMENTS LATER THE AIR FORCE RADAR MEN PICKED UP THE UFO. BUT BECAUSE OF
THE B-26's LOW SPEED, NO INTERCEPTION COULD BE MADE. AT 7:45 P.M. AN F-94
PILOT RADIOED IN, REPORTING THE SAME TYPE OF DEVICE. THE CALL WAS OVERHEAD
BY COLONEL CURTIS LOW, COMMANDER OF A FIGHTER ESCORT WING IN JAPAN. COLONEL
LOW WAS FLYING HIS F-84 JET FIGHTER AT 27,000 FEET.

THREE MINUTES LATER THE WING COMMANDER SIGHTED THE STRANGE OBJECT, EASILY
IDENTIFIED BY ITS RED, WHITE AND GREEN LIGHTS. HE CALLED GROUND CONTROL AND
WAS ASKED TO TRY AN INTERCEPTION.

AS HE CLIMBED, COLONEL LOW SWITCHED OFF HIS LIGHTS. THE OBJECT'S LIGHTS DID
NOT CHANGE -- PROOF THAT IT WAS NO CANOPY REFLECTION. KEEPING HIS OWN LIGHTS
OFF TO AVOID DETECTION, LOW CLIMBED TO 35,000 FEET. WHEN HE GOT CLOSER, HE SAW
THAT THE OBJECT'S LIGHTS WERE REVOLVING IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION -- A
STEADY ROTATION BETWEEN EIGHT AND 12 TIMES A MINUTE.

BESIDE THE SHIFTING COLORS, LOW COULD SEE THREE FIXED SHAFTS OF WHITE
LIGHT SHINING OUTWARD, APPARENTLY ONE PART OF THE OBJECT WAS ROTATING, BUT THE
CHANGE OF COLORS WAS PUZZLING. AT TIMES THE OBJECT WAS ONE SOLID COLOR, WHITE
GREEN, OR RED. IN BETWEEN, THE WING COMMANDER SAW BRIEF COMBINATIONS -- RED-
WHITE, RED-GREEN AND GREEN-WHITE, BUT THE THREE WHITE BEAMS REMAINED
CONSTANT.

AFTER WATCHING THE DEVICE FOR A MOMENT LONGER, COLONEL LOW OPENED HIS F-84
TO FULL POWER, RACING IN AT OVER 500 MILES AN HOUR. HE TRIED TO CLOSE THE
GAP. APPARENTLY HIS UNLIGHTED PLANE WAS NOT SEEN FOR A SECOND OR TWO, THEN
THE UNKNOWN INCREASED ITS SPEED, GRADUALLY PULLING AWAY, IT DISAPPEARED IN
SECONDS.

FIVE MINUTES LATER, CIRCLING AT 35,000 FEET, THE WING COMMANDER SAW THE
OBJECT AGAIN. AS BEFORE, IT WAS AT HIS LEVEL, BUT NOW MOVING PARALLEL WITH
THE F-84. THIS TIME, AS A 1:30 COLONEL LEFT HIS LIGHTS ON WHEN HE TRIED TO
CLOSE IN. IMMEDIATELY TURNING WEST, THE STRANGE OBJECT SPEEDED UP, SO
SWIFTLY THAT IT VANISHED IN FIVE SECONDS.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

About 7:20 p.m. December 7, 1952, at Air Force radar base 1 northern Japan received a call from a radar operator who sighted a UFO. It looks like a classic of its kind, with unusual movements. Moments later, the radar men picked up the 1750. Because of the radar low speed, the object was a jet type of device. The call was confirmed by Col. Curtis Low, commander of a fighter-escort wing in Japan. (As he was mentioned in the case, I am using his draft name.) He was flying his F-84 jet fighter at 37,000 feet. Three minutes later, he sighted the strange machine. He called it an interceptor and was asked to give an interception.

As he climbed, Colonel Low saw the object's lights did not change—proof that it was no canopy reflection. Keeping his own lights off to avoid detection, Low climbed to 35,000 feet. By this time the object was so that the saucer's lights were revolving in a counterclockwise direction—a steady rotation, between 8 and 12 times a minute.

It Vanished in 30 Seconds
Low could see three fixed shafts of white light shining outward. Apparently, one part of the machine was rotating, but the change of color was peculiar. At times, the hue would shift between white, green or red between the various combinations — red-white, red-green and red-white. But the three white beams remained constant.

Low left his F-84 to full power, Racing in at over 500 miles an hour, he tried to close the gap. Apparently, his unlighted plane was not seen for a second or two. Then the saucer increased its speed. It disappeared in 30 seconds.

Five minutes later, circling at 33,000 feet, Low saw the machine again. This time, as a test, he left his lights on when he tried to close in. Immediately turning west, the saucer rapidly sped up, so withdrawing that Low could not follow.

Eleven nights later, another machine with similar rotating lights was sighted over Japan and tracked by radar. With the previous case, Low correlated both cases to war correspondents, withholding the details I have just given.

"Don't dismiss these as the reports," he warned the reporters, "these were actual sightings by trained pilots and radar operators."

(The ATIC summary of this incident stressed the stability and reliability of the colored and his testimony. The tone of this report is very similar to previous sightings of this type of device. There is a great possibility that this is a "Jupiter." The conclusion is nominal.—Ed.)

Headline: Air Force Reveals Pilot's Story Flying Disk Buzzed Japan F-84

Article text:
A UNITED STATES AIR BASE IN NORTHERN JAPAN, Wednesday, Jan. 28.—An American pilot saw at close range a mysterious flying disk make a pass at an F-84 fighter jet over central Japan and then speed away, the Air Force reported today.

The base intelligence report quoted an intelligence officer as saying the disk was "noiseless" and "metallic looking." Just before noon on Jan. 28, Lt. David G. Graham, an Air Force pilot, said the disk was about eight miles from his F-84, closed to within twenty feet of the fighter, briefly paralleled it, and then disappeared.

It was the second disclosure of such a sighting in recent months through the acts over Japan. First American-made public intelligence reports of a "flying saucer" in Japan were dated Dec. 29 and were without comment.

Lt. Graham was flying a F-84 interceptor at about 500 miles an hour when he watched the disk. He said the disk was metallic, had no exhaust protectors and left no exhaust or vapor trails.

He said there were no markings on the disk that there was a "ripple in the metal skin." He estimated the disk was flying at about 200 miles an hour.

Lt. Graham's report to Intelligence said the disk made a pass from the Thunder, closing from behind, then pulled up and away.

The disk rapidly, and just before it pulled up, tilted its fuselage to a 45-degree angle, almost perpendicular to the ground, Lt. Graham said. He added that the disk disappeared at approximately a 90-degree bank.

Then it flashed with tremendous acceleration and or three seconds, pulled away and around his stationary wing appearing to tip over as if all the time it was playing with him.

"Then it passed him, crossed in front of him and pulled up abruptly, apparently to accelerate and take out of sight in a steep climb," Lt. Graham said.

Sightings of the light clusters were made at several points over northern Japan on Dec. 29.

In a Washington, a spokesman at Air Force headquarters said today's report was indicated more of the technical intelligence officer of the Air Material Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was getting reports on flying saucers.

He was indicated not be a report sent to the Far East for such a report.

secret space war?

[The rest of the text is as follows, with some sections quoted directly:]

the Mathematics and Astronomy department at the University of New Mexico here, and also Director of the University's unique Institute of Meteorites (meteor studies). He says this:

The green fireballs of 1951 could be a brand new kind of meteor.
- Certainly they differ from ordinary fireballs - big meteors bright enough to cast a shadow and which usually end in an explosion.

They're different because:
> They are more brilliant - some reported much bigger and brighter than the moon.
> Ordinary fireballs are rarely this impressive.
> They are silent, where ordinary fireballs of comparable size fall with a roar.
> They follow a straight line - where big meteors, perpetrating our atmosphere, always have curved trajectories, concave toward the earth.
> Most unusual of all is their green color. The livid shades, as green as a traffic light or neon sign, are absolutely new.

"Consequently," says Dr. LaPaz, "we may be witnessing in November" something which nearly parallels the green fireballs during a bombardment of red-hot B-B shells.

Such facts lead to one conclusion: If the green fireballs are meteors, they are of an absolutely new type. Their coming may mean that the solar system (including our earth) has lately reached a new corner of the universe where totally unexpected events can occur.

GEOLOGY STUDENT Ted Chamberlain draws picture of fireball he saw while riding in jeep on night on Nov. 4 (see story). Ball had deep green head, but shaded to lighter green and white toward tail.

By WALLACE A. SPRAGUE

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - We face a mystery of outer space even more arresting than the unsolved "flying saucers." It is the mystery of the giant green fireballs.

Nine of them flashed across the skies of the Southwest U.S. late last year. Each vanished though its light had been switched off. No trace of a single one has been found.

People here are trying to unravel the mystery. Atomic energy scientists at the armed forces' Sandia Base, where the atom bomb is assembled, across the state is the rocket laboratory of White Sands. They know what technical wonders our scientists can produce.

A ball when they see a green ball bright as the moon streaking silently across their skies, they know no ordinary event is taking place.

"They know, too, that this is no "flying saucer" hoax, based on flimsy evidence from a few observers. Already, more than 165 separate written reports are on file concerning one giant fireball seen on November 2. Sober scientists and observers are beginning to think that the answer to the fireball riddle may mark a milestone in our knowledge of outer space.

What is the green fireball seen only in our Southwest? A brand new meteor - or something much more frightening, possibly long-range guided missiles or even space vehicles?

One place to start unraveling the mystery is on a dirt road snaking across the New Mexico desert one Sunday night last November.

Overhead, stars glistered in the clear, light air. Along the rutted road trudged a rebuilt jeep at 25 miles per hour. Riding inside were three University of New Mexico students, Ted Chamberlain, senior in geology, his friend, Gus Armstrong, and another.

It was nearly 9, and the youths were returning from an antelope hunt on the San Agustin plains near Magdalena. In the rear of the jeep lay their kill, a medium-sized buck. Suddenly, all three were blinded for a half-second.

The Jeep Ran Wild

Far in the Northwest sky burned a giant green fireball falling fast at an angle of about 25 degrees. Its tail was whitish, but the ball itself was the typical color of a green neon tube - or, as Chamberlain recalls, of copper-burning in a laboratory burner.

"Look!" yelled Armstrong. As he did so, he lost control of the jeep, which hit a rutted, vaulted a five-foot bank, and dumped its occupants on the roadway idest. Overhead, the fireball silently vanished. Minutes later the three dazed young men re-started the jeep, and rolled on toward Albuquerque.

• Something similar had almost happened two nights earlier
• Later Miller and his wife, of Palo Alto, Calif., had been driving east on Highway 60 near Globe, Ariz.
Not long after dark they too, saw a great blue-green burst overhead. "It was so intense that I nearly drove off the highway. I was temporarily blinded," said Mr. Miller.
This was no ordinary meteor display.

Watchers across a 1,000-mile span from Santa Fe, N.M., to Vista, Calif., watched the green fireball in the heavens.
Conductor J. B. Hale of a Santa Fe freight train was sitting at his desk aboard a caboose at Flagstaff, Ariz.

"One of the brakemen outside yelled for me to hurry up, for a terrible looking blue-green flash had just lit up the sky," he reported.

"I Saw a Fireball . . ."

Railroad conductors are not excitable people. Neither are airline pilots. Yet the same night Captn. Grady C. Kelly and Thomas R. Ballard of Slick Airways watched a plane as they approached Kirtland held here. "We both commented at the time that it was by far the brightest meteor we had seen in 10 years of flying," Ballard said later.

Elsewhere, a convalescent soldier, Bill Henderson, at Ft. Bayard, N.M., watched the ball of fire from his hospital window. An observer 12-year-old girl, Evlnita Ann Rife, of Santa Fe, saw it and described its head as "rounded, bluish-green, with an orangy-red tail."

• Scientists at Los Alamos saw the display and reported on it. So did the Civil Aeronautics Administration's tower man at Truth and Consequences, N.M. So did Walter Haas, of Las Cruces, an experienced observer of meteors.

So did Julian B. Blue Jacket, a Navajo.

Some westerners blamed the collapse of a water tower at Tucumcari, N.M., (which killed four), on such a fireball. Investigation showed the flash seen at the moment of collapse came from short-circuited electric lines.

But to all who have seen them, sight of the great green fireballs flashing through the heavens is an unforgettable experience. They, like thousands of other Americans here, have wondered what they are.

No government source knows—or if any does know, it isn't saying. Thank foes for the giant Atomic Energy installation at Los Alamos, and for the careful technicians at Sandia Base here. The Department of Defense is also mum, although various Intelligence and scientific agencies of the government have shown interest in the fireball mystery.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

about 15° above the eastern horizon. This might mean it was at a very high altitude and faded because of the light from it passing through more of the atmosphere as it neared the horizon. So it is very hard to make an estimate on the altitude and since the speed would depend upon the altitude it is hard to make an estimate. It would a meter because it went to slow, and it was too fast for a jet. We both know what these look like, and can tell one when we see one.

It would almost have to be mechanical to travel in the speed curve it does.

The reason why I write you know (12 years after I saw it) is because since then I have become very interested in "flying saucers". Then when I saw this field I decided that I should write you. I did nothing, you then that I saw something but waited two careful for you.

CASE NO. 17

29 DEC 1952

Misawa AFB, Japan

At 1150 hours 29 March 1952 an unidentified object was observed approximately 20 miles north of Misawa AFB. This sighting was made by an AF pilot flying a T-6 a/c.

This T-6 was traveling at 6,000' altitude on a heading of 0 degrees at 130 knots. At the time of sighting, 2 F-84 a/c were making practice runs on the T-6. The object was first noticed by the pilot of the T-6 a/c when it pulled abreast of him and reflected the sunlight. The object then appeared to make a pass at the F-84 at an estimated 40-50 feet in excess of the F-84's airspeed. It closed rapidly and just before flying into his fuselage, it decelerated to his airspeed almost instantaneously. In doing so, it flipped on its edge at approximately a 90 degree bank. It then fluttered within 20' of his fuselage for 2 or 3 seconds, and pulled away around his starboard wing where it was caught in the slipstream behind the aircraft and flipped once. Then it passed him, crossed in front of his and pulled away abruptly, appearing to accelerate and shot out of sight in a steep almost vertical climb. The pilot of the F-84 didn't observe the object.

Comment

No further information has been forthcoming. No explanation for this sighting can be proposed other than the possible reflection and refraction of light through the canopy of the observer's aircraft.

1. The source whose information comprises this report, experienced two sightings of an unidentified flying object. Both sightings provided the source with some unusual exhibits of the object's configuration. The first sighting occurred at twilight and the best illustrates the general nature of the object; but it is anchored on the periphery. Inclosure number 1 lends the visual portrayal of what the source saw.

2. Unevaluated "hear-say" reports from other agencies in this area increases the "weight of these sightings", since to the best of the source's knowledge, these scattered "hear-say" reports once proposed by Allied Intelligence agencies at the same scene, should lend to the substance of this specific sighting.

1. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: A single flying object of unknown actual size. At the initial sighting, observer was certain it was larger and brighter than any of the stars or the surrounding sky. Since this observation was made during or after F-84's take off, it was unable to note whether the object was actually moving or stationary. The observer's first impression of object's motion was that this object was located first at one point, then moved to another point from west to east. The object was unusual in its color description. It was a solid color, while and rose. These colors gave off three colors, i.e., slightly shifting motion was constant during both observations (establishing this mainly by the object's color changes). In an effort to describe colors, similar to the change in colors often seen in neon signs or juke-boxes, the observer noted colors as a solid color, i.e., either white, green or red - but in the process of observation, a very slight change of white/green plus the other possible combinations of these colors. Several times the observer could describe the color as (near) white body. These beams of light that formed from body outlined a shape of white light. These three beams never changed their relative positions, and actually were not quite still and in a searchlight-like angle. These white beams positioned on a broad, rectangular shape, with one remaining leg displaced. Very much like the legs on the lower section, with the 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, and 9 o'clock. It is possible that 1 & 1/2 to lower leg could have been a bit higher on a broad solid area. The observer noted that at 12,500 ft altitude the object. The observer recalls that the upper beam located just off center tended to be somewhat off center. The observer was able to balance the act. The object at no time executed any violent maneuvers, except for an almost vertical change of direction landing. The observer attempted to estimate the speed of revolution of the three color beams in a two hour, 20 minute period estimated to 4 to 5 seconds. There was no exhaust visible during either observation.

2. TIME OF SIGHTING: The source occasioned the sighting of this object on two occasions at 1242 hrs, then time, and lasted till 1259 hrs. The first sighting was in progress at 2000 hrs and was terminated at 2005 hrs, then.

3. ALTITUDE OF OBJECT: Both sightings were made visually by the pilot of an F-84F aircraft. The first observation was at the local area of Sapporo, Japan. The first observation was made while he was at 25,000 ft. altitude of the object was within 16. His second sighting of the object was also at 25,000 ft. altitude. During one period, his position indicator was at 33,000 ft. altitude in a VLF of 125 kcs - and time spent a speed of 412 knots. At the conclusion of the Mach - for this aircraft, F-84G, .82.

4. LOCATION OF OBJECT: The occurrence position at the time of initial sighting was 44° 10' North, 147° 10' East. At an altitude of 25,000 degrees, 231° East on the heading of 010 degrees at a radius of 20 miles. The was flying a short heading of 010 degrees at an altitude of 25,000 ft. with a starting point of 44-10N, 147-10E, hovering on an area of 20 miles. Almost due north of the object at approximately 10 deg. 30' - 140 deg. 30' E. some 7 minutes after.

Meeting No. The action caught sight at a object for two hours just prior landing near Sapporo at 2° 28' N, 141° 08' E. This was at 20,000 feet, and the source was still at 38,000 ft altitude, but heading 1/2 on my heading of 140 degrees. Winds at 20,000 ft altitude level were 3-4 pilot, and it seemed approximately 3 degrees out to 4 or 5 degrees from my heading. The general mode of those sightings are to draw northern portion of the island of Hokkaido, Japan.

on this heading, he rode to the coast again at 35,000 ft level with his end right wing somewhat to be a good lookout course. On this heading, it was at nearly 30 degrees to the west of his starboard wing. It was a modifi- 
ed B-29 to near Fuchu after checking (all his navigation lights were on the right). To assure main traffic on west up at 1st area: Following covering a/c was sighted in about five seconds time. It was a good visual object and went to west and disappeared rapidly to disappear. Thought was a/c was 1st, which was a/c F-84. Noted the other's block altitude with 1st, 1st, 1st, with lights outside. In the first instance, with 1st, 1st, 1st, 1st, 1st. In the first instance, he was a true object. He was not a mirage. On 1st, 1st, 1st, he had two F-84's that were the other's block. Though had been queried why a block was not observed, he said no reason of course and suggested in 30 seconds. Source then continued to the crew of the team.

AIRCRAFT DETAILS: The pilot of this F-84 was originally at an alt and so no definite of position; unusual, by virtue of nearby a radio-navigation point on this heading. The F-84 call sign used by this element was "marker". The source stated that time to F-84 was reported; this was not clear. At his transmission no data was given, but he stated that he was a pilot, Jr. and to exact orbits of his transmission were not recalled, but he drew some indication of the F-84 saw the object near 1925 hrs. The pilot initially was given a/c type of first F-84 near here. Here, local and it is assumed there was a/c F-84. (In sighting record of neighboring intelligence area class added to the fact that this "marker" did in its passed two F-84 near Hkm Air Base. In addition, similar report was heard from a person in the same area evening.

COMMENTS OF INTELLIGENCE OFFICER:

1. The transcript of a source exhibited does not substantiate any sighting on his airway, coupled with the possible enemy "object" not really will. True to a result in a more basic description or an "object" not seen. The source's experience with aircraft identification is good, attention to a/c types or performance characteristics. Just actions noted will be taken to require a full statement of his history to prove will to continue. All to a call to these sighting was excellent and well taken. So no negative tactical (?) to block out of it's general area during the early evening hours of 29 October 1952.
