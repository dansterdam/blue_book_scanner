PROJECT 10073 RECORD CASE

30 DEC 52
DATE OF SIGHTING: 30/12/51
TIME: 1955 HRS 
LOCATION: HOKKAIDO ISLAND, JAPAN
ATTIC DOCUMENT 11519/
UNCLASSIFIED
The report states that the object observed was not rotating, appeared to be spherical, varied in color from red to white, and was seen by 6 crew members of a BTSC aircraft. The object appeared to be moving at a speed considerably greater than the aircraft. It was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes before disappearing. The pilot of the aircraft, who was an Air Force colonel, attempted an interception but was unable to close on the object.

The document also mentions concurrent sightings of other unidentified lights in the area, and notes that the planet Venus in the night sky may explain some of the phenomena observed. It states that the sighting was "UNCLASSIFIED" and "DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS".

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT OF REPORT: 
1. The source showed great presence of mind in the investigation of this case. When the sighting was made, he went to an underground command post and immediately reported it. This was the proper procedure to follow in sighting of this nature. 
2. The source states that he has received training in recognition of aircraft and their capabilities. He was able to observe certain characteristics of the object which differentiated it from conventional aircraft. A clear sketch not only of the object itself but of its maneuvers, as well as the flight path, was provided.
3. The report states that the object was observed near a known radar site and that it exhibited characteristics not common to conventional aircraft. Its high speed, abrupt changes in direction, and ability to hover are indicative of a highly technical device not presently in our possession.
4. The report is considered to be of great value in the continuing investigation of aerial phenomena of this nature. The source is considered to be reliable and his report is given full credence.

5. In all cases except the reported ground sighting, the object was observed at altitudes between 5,000 and 80,000 feet. This indicates either a high performance aircraft, or some extraordinary object. 

6. The USAF advances the following comment which could provide a possible explanation:

"The planet Venus is at maximum elongation at this time of year, appearing like a high-performance aircraft. The observations where planets assume approximately the same relative position have in the past been mistaken for aircraft when observed under certain conditions."  

AS 29 MARCH 1952, VENUS WAS LOCATED AT 12,000/1300. BETWEEN 1900/2300 AND 1100/2400, ITS HEIGHT ABOVE THE HORIZON WAS BETWEEN 19 AND 28 DEGREES. THIS WOULD EXPLAIN ANY NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN POSITION AND ALTITUDE OF THE OBSERVED OBJECTS.

Transcribing the text from the document:

1. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: Object was a brilliant light that appeared to change color by another as observed. It was a gradual change varying in a clockwise manner from orange, to blue, to green, and to red, then repeat. The object was estimated to be the size of a football at arm's length and was observed to have been on a level course.

2. TIME OF SIGHTING: At 19:40L for about 12 minutes.

3. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Visual, without optical aids from a B-29 aircraft. Two pilots and one radar observer were involved.

4. DESCRIPTION OF FLIGHT PLAN: The aircraft was on a training exercise and had sustained distance from the aircraft. Observers were the pilot and radar observer of an aircraft.

5. COURSE OF OBJECT: The course of the object was erratic. Observers were a Major, a pilot, and a Captain, radar observer.

6. COMMENTS: All and visibility was unlimited over clouds. Winds 55-63 knots from 280°. Object at 20,000 feet.

7. CONCLUSIONS: There are numerous sightings similar to this one on file with the USAF and are attempts to explain them as celestial objects or astronomical phenomena but no definite identification or explanation has been made.

8. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Negative.

9. TEMPERATURE: Aircraft was under control of GCI on another mission so it could not maneuver closer for a better observation.

10. AIR TRAFFIC: Other traffic in the general area included a C-54 aircraft that was 25 miles NW of the object's position. This aircraft also reported the unidentified radar track.

The sighting lasted from about 1810 to 1830 hours, as observed. The object in the air is described as round or spherical shape, estimated to be about 150 feet in diameter, zig-zagging at what appeared to be a very high rate of speed vertically and laterally. The object was estimated to be about 10,000 feet in altitude.

The weather conditions were clear with 10/10ths of visibility and no clouds. The object was observed to blink on and off at intervals and would turn on a tight axis. The object was also observed to drop small objects at irregular intervals. The objects appeared to flutter as they fell, and the object would then move off rapidly in a different direction.

At 1900 hours, the object disappeared and could not be found again in the area by search. This incident could explain the article who die into the northern.

This report provides a possible explanation for this type of sighting.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

STATEMENT

On 29 December 1952, I was the pilot of a night-scrambled F-94, orbiting at 15,000 feet over the Hokaido area, Japan. My radar scope showed the usual pattern of ground targets and aircraft when suddenly a brilliant light, which was apparently below the altitude of 15,000 feet, appeared in my line of vision. This light was stationary and shaped like a star. As I watched, its color changed from red to white to green to blue, finally returning to red. The changes in color were complete and rapid, taking place in a matter of seconds. The light remained stationary for 2-3 minutes, then suddenly it accelerated at a speed which I estimated to be over 1,500 mph and disappeared from sight. I immediately notified ground control of what I had observed, but was informed that they had no apparent movements on their radar whatsoever. From 17:01 until about 19:55, when I returned to base, I continually kept a sharp watch, but saw no further indications of this object.

STATEMENT

We were watching a tight orbit over Sakhalin (48°48' 27'N) at 20,000' awaiting a radio contact on 8276 kcs. The object was first sighted at 0600. It appeared to be making a ground beacon. It was unable to establish radio contact. It came from a westerly direction at a high altitude of 18 due to a cloud cover below a maneuver to descend it came to a 4500' altitude and continued on a constant course toward the east. The color change was from green to white and back to red. The maneuver lasted for approximately 5 minutes. After it changed to white, its speed increased to approximately twice of that of our jet fighter heading on it. It rolled out of our sight in a vertical attitude, leaving a trail behind it. When we lost the object our heading was 095° and the time was 1928.

HOKKAIDOISLAND, JAPAN

A single flying craft of unknown serial size was observed on 3 occasions, first sighted at about 4:30 P.M. and listed until about 2:30 P.M. the following day, approximately 21 hours. The object appeared at about 2000 hours and was observed at 2300 hours (local time). As initial sighting observers were unable to detect it with the naked eye and any of common viewing devices. Since the plate resting has been observed, the observation was cloudy for all three observations, due to obscuring the contrast between the object and sky. No color or form of propulsion was likewise unknown. First impression of description that object appeared to be a circular disc-type machine was based on contrary to size and dimension of lights twinkling rapidly during their cycle of rotation. Its body "whose shape can only be assumed to be circular" gave off steady, rainbow-colored beams. These were the colors that gave the object a flickering effect when sighted. This operation was continued through the night, the cycle of rotation being similar to the change in colors often seen in popular makes of juke-boxes. As these colors faded, a solid color, either blue or green, would come into the view indicating a revolution and the body was frequently alternately red and white or yellow and white-green plus the other possible combinations of the 3 colors. Beyond the convenience of the observer, the case was one of estimation as to time and detail and that the record of the observation was made from memory, which in all probability may not be complete nor precisely correct.

E/O 501st Air Base Wing, APO 919 AR-4-52 PAGE 6

STATEMENT

I was the pilot on the F-94 and 2nd Lt. Halford C. Jauday was my radar observer on a scramble from Chitose AFB, Japan, at 18:25, 25 December 1952. We were scrambled to investigate an unidentified target that had appeared on the radar scope. The target was first observed at a distance of 20,000 to 25,000 yards and we were directed to close in. We did so in a rectangular search pattern from an altitude of 20,000 to 24,000 feet. The target remained fairly stationary and we were unable to close in more than 10,000 to 12,000 yards. It appeared to be a definite, solid object shedding a grayish white color as opposed to a white color to a white glow to a white color. The object maintained the same relative brightness and size as it would have appeared from a distance of 10,000 to 12,000 yards. It did not appear to have any lights and remained silent and vertical. Ground control radar contact was maintained throughout the operation. Our ground control had visual contact with the object at the same time. Although we expended all our fuel in the vain attempt to close in on the object, we were unable to estimate the range, except to say that it was beyond the 20,000 to 25,000 yard range of our radar. I was unable to estimate the size of the object, except to say that it was larger than a normal aircraft. I was unable to determine the exact speed of the object, except to say that it was definitely faster than our aircraft and that we were unable to close the gap between us and the object. At the termination of our fuel, we returned to base. I could not estimate the exact time of the incident, except to say that it was approximately 30 minutes from the time of scramble until the time we returned to base at 18:55. During the entire time we were airborne, ground control had continuous radar contact with the unidentified target.

STATEMENT
I was the Radar Observer on the F-94 which sighted unusual lights 29 December 1952. After contacting Chitose and reporting flashing red horizontal and green vertical lights, it was confirmed that a radar blip was received and a visual contact was made.

The object was estimated to be 12 miles south of Chitose and was tracked on radar for approximately 15 minutes. Initial contact was at 30,000 feet and the object was observed to descend to 10,000 feet before it was lost below the horizon. It was reported that the object maneuvered in a zigzag course and appeared to accelerate rapidly as it disappeared.

It was impossible to determine the size, shape or composition of the object. No sound was detected and the lights appeared to be part of the object. The lights would change from steady to flashing and were observed to change color from red to white to green. The object was estimated to be moving at approximately 1,500 miles per hour.

This report is submitted for your information.

STATEMENT
I was pilot of B-26 call sign Fletcher 45, the night of 29 December 1952. At that time we were returning from Yokota AB to Itazuke AB when I observed a strange object at approximately 20,000 ft. The object was about the size of a 50 cent piece held at arm's length, circular in shape. It appeared to be white in color and seemed to be traveling in a horizontal path away from the direction of the aircraft. The object was a steady white light, just above my altitude approximately 20,000 ft. As it moved away, the light appeared to be varying in brightness as it was descending. As it continued to move away, it appeared to be a steady white light.

and 7:30 clock positions. The observer recalls that the upper beam located just off the center appeared to be exactly opposite the lower right beam and resembled a one-way street. He states that no time estimate was recorded on the observations except for an almost gradual change of direction during the 2 observations. The observer attempted to estimate the speed of RAMS revolution of the 3 color series in the body, and he is doubtful estimated it to be 4 seconds. There was no time estimate noticed during either observation.
Two sightings were made visually by the pilot of an F-94-C /js. Subject pilot was engaged in local area night flying. His first observation was made while he was at an altitude of some 23,000* when he noticed the object remained in his view vision to 33,000* at which point he was level with it. His second sighting of the object was also at 33,000* altitude. During the period, the pilot's estimated duration was exhibiting 330 knots, constant altitude of his flight path speed of 1.53 hours, covering a distance still unknown.
The observer's position at the time of initial sighting was to deg 57 min 13 sec N 114 deg 23 min 13 sec E. He was flying a bag heading of 010 deg at an altitude of 27,600*. At this sighting the object was higher than the observer at 9 o'clock position which was almost due north. The first sighting of the object was approximately 41 deg 32 min N - 140 deg 39 min E some 7 minutes after first seeing it.
The observer caught sight of the object for the second time just 5 minutes after losing sight of it. This was at 2000 hrs, & time and the source was still at 33,000* altitude, but heading 33 cm magnetic heading of 160 deg. During this second sighting, the object was still at the same attitude level as the F-94c pilot, but it appeared approximately 30 cm off to the right of the F-94's nose - distance still unknown.
The general area of these sightings was extreme northern portion of Island of Hokkaidō, JAPAN.

STATEMENT

The approximately 12:00t on the night of 29 November 1952, it was flying on a heading of approximately 270 degrees, at an altitude of approximately 23,000 feet, over the Hokkaido Island area of Japan. The object was first observed at approximately 24 miles distance to the northwest, traveling at an estimated speed of 70 to 80 miles per hour. As the object approached the aircraft, the speed apparently increased to an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour. The object showed a tail all one sudden swirling motion, giving the appearance of being transparent. When the object was approximately 5 miles from the aircraft, the pilot interrupted the object with his aircraft. The pilot observed the object but nothing was recorded on the radar. The vertical visibility was unlimited at 15,000 feet. The pilot reported the sighting to the 67th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, who in turn reported it to the 543d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. Specific information concerning landing, launching or any unusual light or activities within the area were negative. The possibility of an unusual natural phenomena being the cause of the sighting is considered extremely remote.

STATEMENT

I was on duty in the control tower, 5 December 1952, at 1830 hours. Upon receiving a call from 4-11, I turned on the equipment and saw an object to the northwest which changed colors from red, white and green. The object appeared to be at an altitude or 10,000 to 15,000 feet and traveling at a high rate of speed. There were no air craft in the vicinity at the time. The object changed colors rapidly - red, white and green - but did not make any sound. I observed the object for approximately 5 minutes and then it disappeared from view. I could not determine the distance of the object, but it appeared to be quite a distance from the tower.

The ground observer conditions were as follows: 3.000 - 5,000 scattered. The ceiling was 2,000 feet broken and the visibility was from 8 to 10 miles. There was no wind at the time. The temperature was 30'F.

The ground observer who spotted the object first called the tower and reported having seen the object. I immediately turned on the equipment and also observed the object.

IS was after 1900 hours. I observed a white light which appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed at about 10.000 feet altitude. It was moving in a straight level flight path from south to north. The light was observed for about 2 minutes and then disappeared. No sound was heard. No other aircraft were in the vicinity at the time.

The weather conditions were the same as listed above.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

2/Lt. 39th Air Division, APO 925

16-M-53

SUBJECT:

I want you to be the tower and I intend to the observer between the 24th pilots who saw the object. The object was first seen about 10:42 p.m. by the pilots of the 24th fighters. The pilots, who were in the air on routine training missions, stated that they saw a bright round object giving off a white light, apparently hovering over the town called Chitose, which is about 20 minutes flying time from their base. According to the pilots, the object maintained a fairly constant position in relation to the town and was estimated to be at an altitude of about 20,000 feet. The pilots stated that the object was about 3 times the size of a B-29 bomber. At one point, the object appeared to change its position, moving away from the town and then back again. This maneuver was observed by 4 pilots. The object was under observation for about 20 minutes. At 11:02 p.m., the object suddenly disappeared from view. Weather conditions at the time were 10/10 undercast, with no breaks in the clouds to be observed.

I am forwarding this report in accordance with existing directives. It is requested that the details of this incident be further investigated. There are no photographs or other physical evidence available. This is all the information I have on this incident.

STATEMENT

The following is an eye witness account of an unidentified object seen by a 27-30 year old US Army Air Force lieutenant on the night of 29 December 1952.

The report describes the lieutenant's observation of a bright light in the sky, which he initially mistook for an aircraft. After observing it for several minutes, he determined it was not an aircraft. The object had a high rate of speed and was flying at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The lieutenant estimated the size of the object to be about 30 feet in diameter. The object was visible for about 15 minutes before disappearing.

The report is signed by WILLIAM G. POZIOIC, 1st Lt, 6518th Air Base Squadron.

OCR TEXT OUTPUT:

ON 29 DECEMBER 1954, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM
an unidentified civilian who reported sighting a LARGE OBJECT IN THE SKY OVER HOKKAIDO ISLAND, JAPAN. HE STATED HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH AIRCRAFT, AND WAS CERTAIN THIS WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT.
ACCORDING TO HIS DESCRIPTION, THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT 200 YARDS IN DIAMETER (APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF A DC-6), BRIGHT WHITE IN COLOR, AND HAD A LIGHT REDDISH GLOW AROUND THE EDGES. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 10,000 FEET ALTITUDE AND WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. HE WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
AT THIS TIME WE OBSERVED ANOTHER OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE MUCH SMALLER (ABOUT 10 YARDS IN DIAMETER), SILVER IN COLOR, AND TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED FROM WEST TO EAST AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 5,000 FEET. THIS SMALLER OBJECT DID NOT HAVE ANY LIGHTS OR GLOW VISIBLE. IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN ABOUT ONE MINUTE.
THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE GOOD. A FEW SCATTERED CLOUDS WERE PRESENT, BUT DID NOT INTERFERE WITH OBSERVATION. THE VISIBILITY WAS GOOD.
THERE WERE NO AIRCRAFT OBSERVED IN THE VICINITY AT THE TIME THESE OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THESE OBJECTS COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT.

STATEMENT

On 23 December 1952, while serving at KC at Chitose Air Force Base, I was briefed on the contents of this report. Prior to going to the Ground Observer Corps Cadre meeting, I was informed that unusual sightings had been reported in the Chitose area on the previous night, 22 December 1952. It was reported that several objects had been tracked on radar and visually observed by Tower personnel. The objects were described as light in color, spherical in shape, and traveling at a very high rate of speed. According to the report, the objects were described as emitting a pulsating light and changing colors from white to orange. Crews of night flying aircraft reported seeing these objects and were able to confirm the tower's observation. The objects were tracked on radar for approximately 30 minutes and simultaneously observed visually. They appeared to travel both laterally and vertically at speeds estimated between 1500 and 2000 mph. A search was made for the objects but none were found. The objects did not appear to travel either horizontally or vertically. It could not be determined if the objects were solid, reflected, or emitted their own light. The subject is still under investigation.

Time: 1930 to 2000; 22 December 1952.

Transcribing the text in the document:

Case 2-6 (cont'd - page 3)

The pilots reporting these sightings is a colonel possessing long experience in world war II and over 3,000 hours of jet aircraft time. He is reported to be a thoroughly reliable and technically qualified observer.

The sighting was made under the following weather conditions: visibility and ceilng 15,000 feet; temperature 33,000 feet, -56 deg.; pressure 210 millibars. Wind also reported by weather station was 240 degrees at 210 knots.

The pilots of this sap was originally put on his guard to be critical for a watching unusual. he virtue of having a radio-telephone transmission from an air-calling station on. 

The formalities of the source extinguished when the lights on his left, coupled with his persistency in roving the details of his sighting, convinced him that the object was certainly falling into the family of "unconventional flying objects". The source's experience and past actions commanded attention to this acquiescence. This pilot was thoroughly trained in the identification of aircraft, but whatever this object was, it certainly puzzled him.

The comments of this report is very common similar to previous sightings of this nature. Although this object's size, velocity, and maneuverability of the object are not familiar, it is of the same type sightings.

DEC. 29, 1952 NORTHERN JAPAN
AT ABOUT 7:30 P.M., AN AIR FORCE RADAR BASE IN NORTHERN JAPAN RECEIVED A CALL FROM A D-26 CREW.
WE'VE JUST SIGHTED A UFO. IT LOOKS LIKE A CLUSTER OF LIGHTS -- RED, WHITE AND GREEN.
MOMENTS LATER THE AIR FORCE RADAR MEN PICKED UP THE UFO. BUT BECAUSE OF THE SPEED NO INTERCEPTION COULD BE MADE. AT 7:45 P.M. AN F-94 PILOT RADIOED IN, REPORTING THE SAME TYPE OF DEVICE. THE CALL WAS OVERHEARD BY COLONEL CURTIS LOW, COMMANDER OF A FIGHTER ESCORT WING IN JAPAN.* COLONEL LOW WAS FLYING HIS F-84 JET FIGHTER AT 27,000 FEET.
THREE MINUTES LATER THE STRANGE OBJECT, EASILY IDENTIFIED BY ITS RED, WHITE AND GREEN LIGHTS, HE CALLED GROUND CONTROL AND WAS ASKED TO TRY AN INTERCESSION.
AS HE CLIMBED, COLONEL LOW SWITCHED OFF HIS LIGHTS. THE OBJECT'S LIGHTS DID NOT CHANGE -- PROOF THAT IT WAS NO CANOPY REFLECTION.
CLOSEALY BELOW HIT CLIBED TO 30,000 FEET. WHEN HE GOT CLOSER, HE SAW IT THAT THE OBJECT'S LIGHTS WERE REVOLVING CONSTANTLY IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION -- A STEADY ROTATION EVERY 12 TIMES.
BESIDE THE SHIFTING COLORS, LOW COULD SEE THREE FIXED SHAFTS OF WHITE LIGHT SHININGAN UNUSUAL APPEARAPPEARING ONE AFTER THE OBJECT WAS ROTATING. BUT THESE DID NOT CHANGE COLORS - PUZZLING.
ABRUPTLY, THE OBJECT SEPARATED INTO SIX DISTINCT PARTS -- CIRCLING LIKE SATELLITES ABOUT A SUN. THE WING COMMANDER SAW BRIEF COMBINATIONS -- RED-WHITE AND GREEN-WHITE. BUT THE THREE WHITE BEAMS, REMAINEDCONSTANT.
AFTER WATCHING THE DEVICE FOR A MOMENT LONGER, COLONEL LOW OPENED HIS F-84 TO PULL POWER -- DIVING IN AT OVER 600 MILES PER HOUR. HE TRIED TO CLOSE THE GAP. APPARENTLY HIS UNIGHTED PLANE WAS NOT SEEN FOR A SECOND OR TWO. THEN THE UNKNOWN INCREASED ITS SPEED, GRADUALLY PULLING AWAY. IT DISAPPEARED IN 22 SECONDS.
FIVE MINUTES LATER, CIRCLING AT 35,000 FEET, THE WING COMMANDER SAW THE OBJECT AGAIN. AS BEFORE, IT WAS AT HIS LEVEL, BUT NOW MOVING PARALLEL WITH THE F-84. THIS TIME, AS A TEST, COLONEL LEFF HIS LIGHTS ON WHEN HE TRIED TO CLOSE IN. IMMEDIATELY TURNING WEST, THE STRANGE OBJECT SPEEDED UP, SO SWIFTLY THAT IT VANISHED IN FIVE SECONDS.

Transcription of the text in the document:

ATIC SUMMARY OF THIS INCIDENT:
On December 7, 1952, the Air Force radar station in northern Japan received a call stating that a flying saucer had been sighted. An Air Force pilot was immediately scrambled to investigate. After searching the area, the pilot was unable to visually establish contact with the object. However, the radar station had tracked the object for a considerable period of time, indicating that it was a genuine aerial phenomenon.

The Director of Intelligence of the Far East Air Force, Brigadier General John A. Samford, stated in an official report that the object was definite and under positive radar control and was asked to try an interception. Attempts to make visual contact through two fighter aircraft failed, as the object apparently accelerated rapidly and disappeared from both radar and visual observation. Pilots state they were "unable to close within 20 miles" of the object.

This sighting was corroborated by other radar stations in the vicinity and by aircrews flying at the time. The official conclusion of the investigating Air Force officers was that this incident involved a genuine unidentified flying object and was worthy of detailed investigation.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

SECRET SPACE WAR?

The Mathematics and Astronomy Department at the University of New Mexico here, and also Director of the University's Balloon Altitude Observatory, make an announcement of a somewhat startling nature. 

The green fireballs of 1948 could be a new phenomenon which appears to be of an unidentified flying object (UFO) nature. 

These green fireballs are more or less ellipsoidal in shape, and travel swiftly in straight trajectories, but sometimes dip in a "shadow" and which usually end in an explosion.

They are more brilliant - some reported as brilliantly incandescent - than the ordinary meteors or green fireballs.

They are silent, where ordinary fireballs of this kind usually have a loud report. 

They travel at fantastic speeds, estimates made by observers and cameras indicating speeds of the order of 3 to 5 miles per second.

They have curved trajectories, concave toward the Earth, unlike meteors which usually have straight trajectories.

This unusual or at least dissimilar nature of the green fireballs has led to speculations that they may be artificial objects under intelligent control, rather than natural meteors. If this were the case, it would form one of the most dramatic scientific discoveries of all time.

The green fireballs could be thrown by means of some as yet undiscovered natural or artificial process, and this in itself would be of great interest. If it is, it would form one of the most dramatic scientific discoveries of all time.

POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS

The green fireballs could be thrown by some means of as yet undiscovered process, natural or artificial, in which case their existence would be of great interest. 

The green fireballs could be thrown by a Terrestrial source, and if so, whose source is it? This possibility, if true, would be of immense military and scientific interest.

The green fireballs could be controlled by intelligent beings, either terrestrial or extra-terrestrial, which would open up tremendous possibilities of the most serious nature.

In the absence of White Sands proving the origin of the green fireballs, the green fireballs continue to remain an unexplained and intriguing phenomenon. The mere fact of their existence poses some very serious questions.

GREEN FIREBALLS may continue to fall over the Southwest. If this is so, detailed descriptions of each occurrence and study of the circumstances will be important.

WAR?
"How fireball? If it is, it would form brilliant flash meteoritic disroveries:  The appearance that dramatic scientific scientists would generally be caused by a cause  Such fireballs could be thrown by meteorites falling in the form of shooting stars, Just as these of white Sandis Proving the disturbance of atoms is not enough cause the impact of the fireball. The green fireballs, however, offer two suggestive:
1. Evidence of fiery green spun missiles fired from a spaceship.
2. Fireballs of some kind other place during a meteor shower, as explained in official explanation of 1948. The spearance of green fireballs could well be detected by radar, as is slightly odd more during the night than during the day."

THESE PEOPLE SAW 
THEM IN THE SKY:
Russians have such rockets, It would be apparently natural for them to test anything in the sky after it was discovered.
Why They Disappear
Russians have such rockets, it would be apparently natural for them to test anything in the sky after it was discovered.
"Spatial objects before," says DR. Menzel, of Harvard University, " already know of several places to look much attention. We were able to take a look at the photographs of the Russian satellites. They are so small and faint that they could not be seen with the naked eye. If the fireballs are extraterrestrial, they would have had a sound flame, we many would be mistaken for green fireballs. Sightings were immediately any identified in space, or in some meteorological inversion. Probably most of them are just a common sight."

IT IS RATHER difficult to take seriously a lot of the accounts one hears about seeing unidentified flying objects. And the sightings they scream they see on Sunday night last November 3 are certainly one of those. Nine of them flashed across the skies of the Northwest. But they weren't saying saucers. They were saying green fiashes. No trace of a single one has been found. But up there in the sky our scientists say they tell us they saw it all. And one of the sightings has been described in rather graphic detail by the so called armed forces guided radar near Magdelena, where the beam was interrupted several times. But we still don't know what technical wonders our scientists can unbung. However, they may be dealing with the same old saws that have been trotting across their skies, they may be no more extraordinary in their nature than a moth attracted to a floodlight. Already, more than 150 separate southern observers are on the record about seeing these things.

Something similar had almost happened o night before, Mrs. Agatha Gill's wife of this Alton, Gliz - had been driving east on Highway 60 near Alton, ARIZ. coming home from town, too, saw a great light "as bright as a daytime sun, hovering overhead. It was so intense that I nearly drove off the highway, I was so terrified," Mrs. Gill told me.

Watchers across a 1,000-mile span from Santa Fe, N.M. to Vista, Calif.- watched the eerie phenomenon-a small flame-lit object, a Conductor J. B. Hale of a Santa Fe freight train was adding at his track about a caboose, remarked, "That's right, we saw that thing go over just a while ago. It was too bright to look at- - -nearly blinded me to watch it."

"It was by far the brightest meteor we had seen in 15 years af flying," he said.

So did Julian H. Dunn Jr. a Navajo Indian weatherman on the Window Rock Navajo Reservation, N.M. (which killed four) on such a fireball investigation showed certain finely marked angular traces at the impact point, which again may have been caused by the same unusual fiery object.

DATE: 26 SIGHTING: December 16, 1952
TIME OF SIGHTING: 3:52 P.M.
SIZE: about the size of the planet at the thumb nail 
SHAPE: a ring and a ball of light - the ring looked to encircle the ball
COMPOSITION: about 1/3 the size of the ring was a ball of light
SPEED: the ring moved very fast, the ball moved slowly
ALTITUDE: about 2 miles high
DIRECTION OF TRAVEL: went straight up, then changed direction to North
MANNER OF DISAPPEARANCE: disappeared into the cloud, could not be followed further
COLOR: light grey ring, light red ball
SOUND: a whirring sound like static electricity
LENGTH OF TIME OBSERVED: 3 to 5 minutes
SKY CONDITIONS: clear sky
VISIBILITY: clear, no clouds
GROUND DIRECTION OF WIND: light wind, northeast
RADAR, ADGE, RAINING ADDED PHENOMENON: none

REMARKS: (General description of what you saw) (Use back if necessary)
The object was moving in a strange manner, the ball inside the ring was moving slowly while the ring moved very fast in an upward direction, then changed direction to north before disappearing into the clouds. The ring appeared to be about 30 feet across and the ball maybe 10 feet across. The object made a whirring sound like static electricity as it moved. The sighting lasted about 3-5 minutes until it disappeared.

About 10:30 the motion appeared. The object was quite small and faint at first, but gradually increased in size and brilliance as it approached and passed overhead. The rate of motion was fairly rapid, and the object appeared to be approximately 1/20 the diameter of the full moon.

The object was round, and it seemed to have a reddish or orange glow toward the front, shading off into a blue-green toward the rear. At the rear, there appeared to be a tail or trail of luminous gas or vapor. The object moved silently and with no visible means of propulsion.

The duration of the sighting was approximately 30-40 seconds. As the object passed overhead, it seemed to decrease in size and brilliance and finally disappeared from view to the northeast.

I would estimate the total angular motion of the object to have been approximately 60-70 degrees. It moved in a straight line, with no deviation or change of course.

The night was clear, and stars were visible, so the observation was made under good visibility conditions. I would estimate the object to have been at an altitude of 20,000-30,000 feet, based on the rate of motion and apparent size.

METEORS
"This entity, Capt. George E. Foster, Master, reports that at about 0752
GMT, (1752 hours), on 11 Dec 1952, in lat. 39 deg. 56 min N, long. 143 
deg. 08 min E., Japanese fishing vessel Ama, approximately 240 miles
west southwest of Tateyama lighthouse, observed an unidentified object
traveliing east-northeast at an estimated speed of 1500 to 2000 mph. The
object gave off an intense glow, white to light blue in color, and left a faint trail. The course of this object was about east-northeast. This
phenomenon occurred on a moonless night, with a ceiling of 2000 ft. and
good visibility. Temperature outside was 78 F.
Seamen aboard the Ama have observed somewhat similar objects on two
previous occasions, about 1949-1950, when they were navigating the waters
between Japan and the American West Coast. The objects observed on those
earlier occasions gave the impression of being somewhat larger, travelling
at lower altitudes, and leaving more pronounced trails. The observer says
that "the object appeared to be the biggest and brightest he had ever seen
from these previous observations"."

CASE NO. 17
22 DEC 1952
MISHAP, JAPAN

At 1720 hours 22 December 1952 an unidentified object was observed approximately 30 miles south of MISAWA AFB. This sighting was reported by pilot flying a T-33 jet aircraft. This T-33 was traveling at 6,000* altitude on a heading of 0 degrees at 130 knots. At the time of sighting, 2 F-94s were making practice runs on the T-33. The object was sighted to the left rear of the T-33 and was described as a fast moving luminous object. The object had a reddish glow and disappeared to the northwest. The object that was had reflected the sunlight was a small shiny disc-shaped object. The object then appeared to make a pass at the T-33 at an estimated 800-900 mph in excess of the T-33's airspeed. It circled rapidly and just before flying into his aircraft, the pilot deliberately put his aircraft into a maneuver. It dived on the edge at approximately a 45 degree bank. It then fluttered within 20 feet of his fuselage for 2 or 3 seconds, and pulled away around his starboard wing where it disappeared behind the sunlight. When it passed in front of him and pulled away abruptly, appearing to accelerate, and shot out of sight in a steep almost verticle climb. The pilot of the F-94 didn't observe this sighting.

Comment:
No further information has been forthcoming. No explanation for this sighting can be provided other than the possible reflection and detection of light through the canopy of the observer's aircraft.

Conclusion:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
COUNTRY: JAPAN
DATE OF INFORMATION: 9 December 1952
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT, HOKKAIDO ISLAND, JAPAN
1. The source whose information comprises this report is considered reliable and believable. The object was observed for an extended period of time and unusual exhibits of the object's characteristics were noted.
2. Unvalidated "hear-say" reports from other sources in this area indicate the existence of other sightings of similar objects at or near the time of the incident described in this report. These sightings, however, have not been fully investigated and cannot be considered fully reliable or corroborating evidence on the primary observation.

27TH FIGHTER ESCORT WING
 APO 942
1.  AT APPROSIMATELY 21201 (7:30 PM) ON 9 DECEMBER 1952 A DISC-SHAPED FLYING OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY SGT. L.M. CHASE OF THE 27TH FIGHTER ESCORT WING NEAR HAKODATE AIRFORCE BASE, HOKKAIDO ISLAND, JAPAN. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 60 FEET IN DIAMETER AND WAS ILLUMINATED BY AN INTENSE 
BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT.  IT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME IT MANEUVERED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, MAKING ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND ALTITUDE, AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
2.  MATERIAL IN QUESTION:  THE REPORT INDICATED THAT Sgt CHASE WHO OBSERVED THIS PHENOMENON NOTED IT HAD A METALLIC SURFACE WHICH REFLECTED THE LIGHT SIMILAR TO THAT OF ALUMINUM. NO OTHER SOLID OBJECTS WERE VISIBLE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION.  HE STATED IT APPEARED TO BE COMPLETELY SILENT IN OPERATION AND GAVE NO INDICATION OF ANY FORM OF PROPULSION SYSTEM. THE OBJECT DID GIVE OFF A VERY BRIGHT BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINATED THE AREA AROUND IT. HE STATED THAT SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO ALERT OTHER PERSONNEL TO THE PRESENCE OF THE OBJECT BUT IT HAD DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE IT.
3.  WEATHER CONDITIONS:  ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE WEATHER AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION WAS CLEAR WITH GOOD VISIBILITY. THERE WERE NO WEATHER BALLOONS OR AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA AT THE TIME.
4.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS:  THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THIS REPORT DOES NOT PERMIT POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOME TYPE OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN OF ITS MANEUVERING CAPABILITIES AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION WOULD TEND TO MAKE THIS UNLIKELY. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS REPORT BE FORWARDED TO THE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER FOR FURTHER EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

2/7/52 Airman Meilock Mick
on this date whe first witnessed two objects in the sky. The first object was first observed at about 9:30 p.m. as a small bright light near the horizon to the west. This light seemed to grow larger and brighter and was moving in a northeasterly direction. The second object was observed about 15 minutes later at about 9:45 p.m. This was larger than the first and appeared to be a disc-shaped object with a dark center and a bright orange glow around the edges. This object was traveling in a Northerly direction and was observed for about 1 minute, during which time it appeared to change position.

10. ANALYSIS: This report appears to be a valid one and the observations made seem to be of interest. The only weakness appears to be the lack of definite time reference on the first observation and the brevity of the observation of the second object. In general, the report gives a reasonably accurate account of the sightings and the descriptions of the objects seem to be consistent with other reports. There is no reason to disbelieve this report.

CONCLUDED
