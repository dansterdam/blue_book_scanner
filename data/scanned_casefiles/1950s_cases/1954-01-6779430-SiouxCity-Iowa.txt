Dear Sir:

I has come to my attention that around 2 to 4 January 1954 vapor trails of jet craft were seen driving toward for four consecutive hours covering every square mile, apparently in pursuit of a U.F.O./U.A.O. over Solverville, Tennessee, and neighboring communities.

It is my objective to learn the reason for this maneuver. Were these jet craft in pursuit of a U.F.O./U.A.O.? If so, can you inform me of the circumstances; location; maneuvers; and possible identification, including speed, color, shape, etc., of said U.F.O./U.A.O.?

If, for any reason, you cannot give me the requested information for classification/ security restrictions, please forward this missive to the proper authorities.

Thank you for your kind cooperation in this matter.

President
