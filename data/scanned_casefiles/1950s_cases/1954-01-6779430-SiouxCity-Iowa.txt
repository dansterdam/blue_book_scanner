The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is a letter addressed to the "Director, Ground Observer Corps/Air Filter Center, Los Angeles, California" from the "President" of an organization called "Flying Saucers International" located at "P.O. Box 31, Preuss Station, Los Angeles 35, Calif."

The text of the letter is as follows:

Director 
Ground Observer Corps/
Air Filter Center
Los Angeles, California

Dear Sir:

I has come to my attention that around 2:10 4 January, 1954 (0213) unidentified objects were sighted over the vicinty of Sioux City, Iowa, USA. These objects were observed for four consecutive hours, apparently in pursuit of a U.P.O./U.A.O. over Sioux City, Iowa. 

It is my objective to learn the reason for this surveillance. Were these objects set craft in pursuit of a U.P.O./U.A.O.? If so, can you inform me of the circumstances; location, direction, speed, color, and possible identification, including speed.

If, for any reason, you cannot give me the requested information for classification/security restrictions, please forward this missive to the proper authorities.

Thank you for your kind cooperation in this matter.

President

Attachment to USAF report:
(2) The following weather information was made available at this station:
ALTITUDE    READINGS                TEMPERATURE
6000*             340*                     28*
8000*             360*                     32*

14000*           320*                     35*

This report was prepared by 2/14. Major W. Stanley, Intelligence Officer, 537th Air Defense Group, Sioux City Air Base, Iowa.
The object was sighted at approximately 2130 hours on Highway 60 near Sioux City, Iowa. The reliability could be judged as good as the speed and maneuver of the object was of a member of the Army Air Corps.
This writer can make no analysis of the possible cause of the sighting.

Dear Sir:

It has come to my attention that around 2 to 4 January 2, 1954, your trainee or jet craft were seen criss crossed for four consecutive hours at Knoxville, Tennessee, apparently in pursuit of a U.F.O./U.A.O. over that vicinity.

It is my objective to learn the reason for this unusual maneuver. Very often these jet craft in pursuit of a U.F.O./U.A.O. as so, can you inform me of the circumstances, location, and possible identification, including speed, color, of said U.F.O./U.A.O.?

If, for any reason, you cannot give me the requested information for classification/ security restrictions, please forward this missile to the proper authority.

Thank you for your kind cooperation in this matter.
