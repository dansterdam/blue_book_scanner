The image appears to be a black and white photograph with some text annotations. The photograph seems to show an object or shape against a dark background, with varying shades of gray and white. There are markings "TOP" on the left side of the image and what looks like "TO TM" on the right side. The image is somewhat grainy and appears to be an old document or report photograph.

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Country of Activity Reporting: USA
Report No: TR-16-57
Date of Information: 14 Feb 57
Date of Collection: 9 March 1957
Date of Report: 18 March 1957

Activity Submitting Report: 100th Bombardment Wing (H)(SAC)

Prepared Individual: Paul J. Anthony, Capt, USAF

Source: Mr. and Mrs. [redacted]

Evaluation: Uncertain

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object

SUMMARY:
Included is an unidentified flying object report. Observation of UFO was first made by Mr. [redacted] on 15 Feb 57. Knowledge of UFOB was first brought to the attention of the 100th Bomb Wing Intelligence upon receipt of a telephone call from Mr. [redacted] at Law on 9 March 1957.

Feb.14-Laurelton, LL-7:10pm-Brilliant yellow-orange Fireball arcing down-ward to the NE Horizon, 1/4 the size of the Full-Moon.

February 16, 1957, CSI member [name redacted] Condict was walking northward in Laurelton, Long Island, NY. With him, Mrs. [name redacted] was attracted by a bright "Fireball" near the northeastern horizon. It was a brilliant incandescent yellow-orange in color, one-Fourth the size of the recently-sighted full moon, which was just to its right. The meteor moved downward and to the observer's right as he faced it, and "looked as if it were going to hit the ground", but being somewhat low on the horizon, it disappeared from view behind buildings after being observed for 2 to 3 seconds. In Condict hurried to the corner, but it had disappeared.

The observation, one of a group of recent local sightings of fireballs and more or less fireball-like objects, is included here in the hope of obtaining corroborating reports for the purpose of triangulation.

5. The location was Brave Boat Harbor Road, Kittery Point, Maine, 43°05'N, 70°42'W.

   a. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] described the night as cold, dark, and with no stars or moon visible. Mr. [redacted] described the night as cold, bright, and moonlight.

   b. Portsmouth AFB Weather Detachment 27, 5th Weather Group gave the following information: 2/10 cloud coverage at 20,000 feet, surface temperature 27°, surface wind N/NE at six (6) knots. No thunder storms or other unusual activity.

   Winds aloft: 6,000 feet - 100°/73 knots, 10,000 feet - 290°/07 knots, 16,000 feet - 220°/17 knots, 20,000 feet - 230°/35 knots, 30,000 feet - 220°/27 knots, 50,000 feet - 200°/55 knots, 70,000 feet - 180°/37 knots.

   c. Rye GCI Site reported no unusual sightings.

8. Negative.

10. Negative.

11. Knowledge of UFOB first brought to the attention of the 100th Bomb Wing Intelligence upon receipt of telephone call from Mrs. [redacted], Attorney at Law, Kittery, Maine. This phone call received from Mr. [redacted] approximately 1000 hours on 9 March 1957. Date of investigation: 9 March 1957, and 15 March 1957.

12. Photographs of area where Mr. [redacted] thought the object landed.

13. Statements of Observers:
    a. Mrs. [redacted] related she was out in the yard on the south side of her house taking down her washing. Her attention was attracted first by the light. She then observed for a very short period of time an object described as round, and about the size of a softball surrounded by a very bright emerald green light which illuminated the area around the house. The object seemed to be in the center of this light, and did not seem to be burning in its self. The object passed very quickly and did not have or leave any smell, light, residue, wash or effects other than startling the observers. It appeared to be traveling on a course from north to south, (a compass reading taken of the path described was 21.5 degrees mag.) and seemed to angle down after passing overhead of the observer. It appeared to be just above the tree tops, and did not have tail as if it were propelled. There was no explosion observed prior to, during, or after the passing of this object.

    b. Mr. [redacted] related he did not observe that which his wife related, with the exception of the light which the object gave off. He observed the light while putting the car in the garage. Mr. [redacted] discovered at the northeast end of a swamp pond, an odd hole in the ice. On 2 March 57, he discovered, at the northeastern end of a swamp pond, an odd hole in the ice. The hole appeared to be about four inches in diameter, perched in shape, and burned at the edges. This burning was described as looking like it had been cut with an acetylene

cutting torch. The hole edge looked as if it had been edged with fine soft coal.
The hole appeared to have been made at an angle, with the object approaching from a
northerly direction (a compass reading taken of the path described was 320 degrees
mag). The hole was frozen over with clear ice at the time of discovery. Upon
crossing another swamp pond adjacent to the northwest of the pond where the hole was
observed, Mr. [redacted], his son, and two dogs passed through what appeared to be a
band of heat approximately twenty(20) feet wide, running west to east. He entered
and left this bank of heat three times. The dogs appeared to be unhappy and whined
and whimpered several times within the band of heat. On 3 March 57, Mr [redacted]
when he returned to the band of heat the third time. On 3 March 57, Mr [redacted]
and his son returned to the hole in the ice and upon close observation they noticed
an object on the bottom of the pond. The object appeared to be brown in color and
approximately six (6) inches in diameter. Its edges were ragged and was curved as a
portion of a ball. Mr. [redacted] cut a hole in the ice and gently touched the object
with the blade of his axe. The object appeared to be metal to the best of his knowledge. A geiger counter gave a background reading of 20 beats in the area away from
the hole, and a reading of 50 to 70 beats directly over the hole. Mr [redacted]
stated that his TM set had very poor reception since the passing of the object.

c. Mr. [redacted] related he was traveling northeast in his car on Haley road about
one mile from the Kittery Point fire house. Shortly after 1900 hours he observed a
bright light much Like a flash light bulb. This flash appeared over his left shoulder some distance away. The light did not appear to have any particular color other
than white. He did not observe any object, hear a noise, or smell anything at this
time. There were no lights (street lights, car lights, etc.) in the vicinity at the
time of the observation. Mr. [redacted] stated that it was a bright moonlight night.

14. On 9 March 57, an investigation team composed of Capt Anthony, Capt Blue, T/Sgt
McNeill, and S/Sgt Jack visited the pond where the object supposedly fell. Observations of the surrounding area showed no indication of burned trees, bushes, etc.,
which would have been caused by a low flying burning object. Due to mild weather a
large portion of the ice had melted and no trace remained of the hole described by
Mr. Gunderson, nor was any object visible in the water.

15. On 13 March 57, the investigation team again visited the pond where the object
supposedly fell. This time the team was equipped with 1 geiger counter and 1 ion
chamber. The pond and the surrounding area for 50 yards was thoroughly probed. The
highest reading recorded on the geiger counter was 1/100 of a roentgen. The ion
chamber reading was negative. It is the opinion of the investigating team that Mrs.
[redacted] is sincere and convinced that she did see a bright green lighted object pass
over the top of her house and disappear behind the trees. Mr. [redacted] since and
convinced that he saw the bright flash of light in the sky at approximately the same
time that Mrs. [redacted] saw the green lighted object. Bearing in mind that our
investigation took place 30 days after the sighting, Mr. [redacted] story of the
peculiar hole in the ice, and the band of heat is completely unfounded by the result
of our preliminary investigation.
