Unidentified Flying Object Report

1. This report covers the sighting of one (1) unidentified flying object at 1045, 27 February 1959, over the point NG 1070, AMS 1:500,000, San Diego Sheet, by two (2) naval aviators. Both pilots, members of VMF(AW) 513, MAG-15, were flying F4D aircraft. At time of sighting no other air traffic was in the immediate area.

2. Captain Tom D'ANDREA, 0629081/7302 USMCR.

a. Pilot experience: 12 years; 2200 flight hours; 260 flight hours in F4D aircraft.

b. Initial sighting of object by radar while on course of 090 at 36,000 feet, speed 250 knots. Object bearing was twelve (12) miles distant, 15° starboard, high. Pilot executed a climbing turn to starboard. At 43,000 feet the radar broke lock.

c. At 43,000 feet, the object was sighted visually. It appeared to be a heart-shaped form resembling an F4D without a nose cone. It was at an estimated altitude in excess of 60,000 feet. Color of object was white-buff. It left no trail nor exhaust features.

d. Pilot executed a climbing turn to port, coming onto course 200 at 45,000 feet when radar broke lock.

e. Pilot executed a 360 keeping object in sight visually. Object appeared to remain in same relative position without any forward speed, with the point of "heart-shape" turning in the same direction of flight as the F4D. Altitude of object estimated in excess of 75,000 feet.

f. Size of object was that of a dime held at arms length.

g. Contact was broken after second pilot had object in sight.

h. Total time of observation was approximately ten (10) minutes.

3. Captain Henry L. SCHWELL Jr., 060707/7331/6602 USMC.

a. Pilot experience: 7 years; 1300 flight hours.

b. Initial sighting of object was visual while flying at 39,000 feet, speed 250 knots, course 100°.

c. Upon turning to course 180°, sun obscured the object.

d. Captain D'ANDREA first sighted the object and radioed the information of its location.

e. Object resembled a pure delta-wing, without any protrusions, white in color, at an altitude in excess of 60,000 feet.

6. Preliminary analysis by preparing officer (Ass't C/s, G-2):

a. Object being at such high altitude without apparent forward speed undoubtedly was a weather balloon.
