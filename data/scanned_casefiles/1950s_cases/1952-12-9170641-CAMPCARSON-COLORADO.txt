Camp Carson, Colorado                                                24 December 1952

I.    Description of Incident

Observers at Camp Carson sighted a silvery unidentified flying object at 0617 MST. It appeared circular in shape about the size of a baseball, changing from to a tear-shaped configuration and hovered in view for two to three minutes after which it disappeared at a high rate of speed. Observers were three airmen assigned to this base and all stated that the unknown object was located south of their observation point. The object emitted an intermittent white light while in view.

II.   Discussion of Incident

Although the sighting took place two hours after a scheduled piball balloon release at Pueblo, Colorado, this report has been evaluated as possibly balloon due to the description. Its tear-drop shape indicates that it may be a large pre-shaped upper air research balloon. ATIC has not yet had the opportunity to check the object against known upper air research balloon tracks but tentatively evaluates the sighting as shown below.

III.  Conclusion

Possibly balloon.
