AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: U.S.A.

AREA REPORTED ON: Wing, Craig Air Force Base, Pilot Training Wing, Selma, Ala. (Hqs. 3rd Air Force)

DATE OF REPORT: 27 August 1952       DATE OF INFORMATION: 27 August 1952       SOURCE: 1st Lt. LOUIS F. TSCHOLD, O-797,463
                                                                                        1st Lt. ROBERT J. KRISS, AO-959796

SUMMARY: (Enter brief summary of report. Give highlights in first paragraph. List locations in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part I(2))

On the night of 27 August 1952, the two officers listed as the course of this information were 1st Lt. Craig A. Tschold and 1st Lt. Robert J. Kriss, both of Meridian, Mississippi. Their speed was 200 MPH and their heading was 120 degrees. At 2015 hours they saw a pale green light moving at about 10,000 feet.

Source states the light resembled an airplane's navigation light. It was traveling at: nose-and-left no trail. No sound was audible and no method of propulsion could be seen.

The object remained in view for no more than ten seconds. Source states that at first it was above and to the right. It immediately turned north and again vanished quickly out of sight.

The weather at the time was slightly hazy with ceiling unlimited. The wind was from 60 degrees at about 15 MPH. This sighting cannot be explained by any known meteorological or other scientific explanation. No photos or other material evidence of the nature or existence of the object. No efforts were made to intercept it.

Sighted at A-3-1 altitude. Appeared at intervals of approximately 7 minutes. They were easily distinguished from the other aircraft reported. No other aircraft were noted.

These officers seem to be men of sound judgment and stable emotions. There is no apparent reason to doubt their report.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Headquarters, 3315th Pic

REPORT NO.

PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

STATEMENT

The following statement is submitted in accordance with paragraph 7, c, AF 200-5 dated 29 April 1952.

1. The object seen was a pale green light resembling the navigational light of an aircraft. Its size was unknown but it appeared to be 7,000 to 8,000 feet higher than our own aircraft which was at 7,000 feet. There was no sound or exhaust. The object was traveling at a great rate of speed.

2. The object was first observed at 2015 hours, 27 August 1952, and observed for a period of about 5 to 10 seconds.

3. The object was observed with the naked eye from a F-51 aircraft. Our speed was 250 IAS at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

4. The object was seen over Meridian, Mississippi. It was observed heading west and passed over at about 10,000 feet on our 11 o'clock. It turned to the north and rapidly accelerated until it was out of our view.

5. I have been a rated pilot in the USAF since May 1944 and low combat in the Pacific in World War II. I was separated from the service in January 1946 and recalled in May 1951. I have 1,500 hours most of it single engine time.

6. The weather at the time was slightly hazy, and the wind was from 60 degrees at 15 MPH.

7. There were no activities or conditions meteorological or otherwise that can account for the sighting.

8. No photographs or other physical records were made.

9. No attempt was made to intercept the object.

10. Only F-51 airplanes flown by students in cross country were in the area. They could not be confused with the object reported.

Tng. G, Craig AFB, Alabama

REPORT NO. 1-7752         PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

STATEMENT

The following statement is submitted in accordance with paragraph 7, c, A.F.R.

1. The object I sighted was a pale green light of unknown size, somewhat resembling a navigation light of an aircraft. There was no sound or exhaust and the object was traveling at great speeds.

2. It was sighted at 2315 on 27 August 1952, for a period not longer than 10 seconds.

3. I was flying as control aircraft in a F-51 or a student home room in a cross country, and sighted the object visually.

4. At the time of sighting I was flying at 7,020 feet on a heading of 120 degrees at an indicated air speed of 200 M. I observed this object heading west at what appeared to be about 10,000 feet altitude (above and to my right). My location at the time of sighting was directly above the meridian, Mississippi. Almost immediately after initially sighting this object it began to turn to the right or north and finally disappeared out of sight. As previously mentioned in this report it was not in sight for over 10 seconds.

5. I have been a rated pilot since January 1944. I was separated in December 1945, and a regular day job pilot. I fly as many as 720 hours in European Theater of Operation in World War II and served 6 months as instructor in fighters. Since recall in May 1951, I have been an advanced single engine instructor.

6. At the time of sighting the weather was slightly hazy with unlimited ceiling and the wind was from approximately 10 degrees at 15 K.

7. To my knowledge there was no activity or condition of any kind which could account for the sighting.

8. I have no physical evidence of any kind supporting existence of this object.

9. I took no interception action. Only F-51 airplanes flown by students in cross country were in the area. They were not in contact with the object sighted.
