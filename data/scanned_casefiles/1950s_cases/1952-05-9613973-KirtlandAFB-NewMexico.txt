SWORN STATEMENT

I, [redacted], Lt., USAF, 125th Aircraft Control and Learning Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn statement:

On 23 May 1952 at 1600 hours, while acting as Director, I was informed by the door guard that there was a silver object in the sky to the West of our station. I immediately went downstairs to the door and observed a shining object at a low angle from the ground. I then went back to the radar scope and observed three tracks, at 20, 25 and 30 miles heading outbound. After checking with the Identification Section, I was able to identify one track as a Constellation. Idaho #1 being airborne at the time on a test flight, was diverted from over Kirtland to identify the other two tracks and also to search for any unusual objects. Idaho #1 was vectored to 350 degrees and all angels and at approximately 35 miles one track was identified as a Piper Cub. Idaho one continued for the second track on a heading of 260 degrees and at 50 miles, identified a C-47. The third track at this time was 270 degrees and 85 miles.

I received word that the object was still in sight so had Idaho #1 climb to 23 angels and search on an inbound heading. He came within 15 miles of the field without sighting anything and since the object was still in sight from the ground, he was again vectored outbound on a track of 254 degrees at 18 angles.

When at 50 miles, he reported fuel running low, he was vectored toward the base at minimum altitude and landed.

Idaho #1 reported excellent visibility with the only clouds 50 miles West of Kirtland Air Force Base, with tops estimated at 17,000 feet.

At no time was there an indication other than the three outbound tracks, with the exception of Idaho #1.

SWORN STATEMENT

I, [redacted] Lt. USAF, 135th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn statement:

At 1600 MST, Friday 23 May 1952, an object was sighted approximately 260 degrees, West of Building T-420, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.

Object was light in color reflecting the sunlight intermittently. Bright for periods varying from 3 seconds to 2 or 3 minutes. Remaining dark for like periods of time as though slowly circling. Object did not vary it's position horizontally more than 5 degrees.

Object was under constant surveillance from 1605 MST to 1625 MST. Object was viewed through a pair of 7 X 50 Binoculars and the telescope of a transit but due to the distance which was approximately 12 to 20 miles recognition was impossible.

Toward the end of the observing period the object slowly descended below the horizon and out of sight.

Interception was attempted with negative results.

SWORN STATEMENT

Captain USAF, 135th Air-
craft Control and Warning Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn
statement:

On 23 May 1952 at 1600 hours, a shiney airborne object was called
to my attention. This object was approximately 260 degrees from KAFB,
a-peared to be heading west and was approximately 3,000 feet above the
terrain. It a-peared to be 15-20 miles from KAFB and because of this dis-
tance no definite shape could be determined. However, because of the re-
flections, which were continuous, the surface could have been aluminum.

This was called to the attention of the Gladwin Senior Director who
had already received instructions from the Chief Controller at AD3 to
investigate. This object remained in sight about 40 minutes during which
time an Idaho flight, which was airborne, was diverted to investigate.
Since we had no radar contact with the object, the direction of the Ida-
ho aircraft was based on ground observation. A land line was run from
the observer to the dais at Gladwin ADC.

Despite the fact that the Idaho aircraft was dead reckoned and dir-
ected to the position with relation to a cloud bank, the interception
of this object was not successful. After about 25 minutes the Idaho
flight, low on fuel, returned to KAFB for pancake.

[LETTERHEAD PARTIALLY OBSCURED]
Lieutenant Colonel, United States Air Force,

I hereby make this statement

On or about 1600 hours, 23 May 1952, my attention was called by Lieutenant [REDACTED] to a strange object at 260° Azimuth, this Station. This object appeared to me to be approximately one to two thousand feet above the terrain at a range of ten to twenty miles. It did not have any apparent motion other than random motion. I looked at it once through field glasses and it appeared to be silver in color, flat on the bottom, slightly rounded on the upper edge, but the highest portion of the rounded section was offset to the left.

Captain [REDACTED] arrived at this time and the object was pointed out to him. I had called the Direction Center by this time and asked what action had been taken. I was informed that a fighter was now vectoring on 260.

Captain [REDACTED], Lieutenant [REDACTED] and I went to the Direction Center and observed the object from the Radar Maintenance room window. Mr. [REDACTED] was by that time observing the object through a transit telescope. I directed that a line be run from the controller to the observers position which was done within the next two or three minutes. By that time, however, the object had drifted below the horizon and was not again observed by me.

I have on two previous occasions observed objects in the air which I subsequently decided were merely large pieces of paper. This time, however, I can not convince myself that this was either an airplane outbound, a paper object, or a balloon.

The following statement is my opinion of the reliability of the witnesses:

Captain [redacted]--thoroughly reliable.

Lieutenant [redacted]--thoroughly reliable.

Mr. [redacted]--reliable but statement must be considered in the light of his late observance of the objects. He did not study it as long as the others.

Lieutenant [redacted]--reliable but is convinced that the object was an outbound plane even though there is no evidence that a Constellation would have been in that area at that time.

S/CRI STATEMENT

I, [REDACTED] Philco Technical Representative, 135th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn statement:

At about 1600CST, Friday 23 May 1952, my attention was called to a bright object in the Western sky. A transit was available in Maintenance Section, and using this instrument, I attempted to identify the above mentioned object. Although plainly visible to the naked eye because of its brilliance, the object was still too small to be identified using the telescope on the transit. Attempts to identify the object with the aid of a pair of 7 X 50 binoculars were also unsuccessful.

This object was observed for about forty-five minutes during which time it appeared to be floating in the air and moved about in a random fashion. When first observed, it was about 2 degrees above the horizon and almost due West of Building T-420. (About 263 degrees). Total change of position did not exceed 5 degrees horizontally or 2 degrees vertically. No rapid changes in position were observed.

Toward the end of the period of observation, the object's angle of elevation decreased rather steadily and at the same time its brilliance decreased until it became invisible at one time location, bearing about 271 degrees. Brilliance of this object changed continuously, during observation, being bright for periods of two seconds to two minutes, and very dim, sometimes invisible, for like periods. Change in brilliance was gradual.

Motion of this object rules out the possibility of it being an airplane or meteor. Other possibilities are:

1. Helicopter: No helicopters known to be in the area.
2. Flying Saucer: No comment.
3. Piece of paper soaring on thermal: Possibly taken aloft by a whirling wind. Explaining motion and change by brilliance cannot be discounted because of high brilliance of observed object. Sunlight on floating paper results in an unusually brilliant object when viewed with the sky as a background.

It is my opinion that the object sighted was a piece of paper.
