SWORN STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED

I, _________, Lt., USAF, 135th Aircraft Control
and Warning Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn statement:

On 23 May 1952 at 1600 hours, while acting as Director, I was in-
formed by the door guard that there was a silver object in the sky to
the West of our station. I immediately went downstairs to the door and
observed a shining object at a low angle from the ground. I then went
back to the radar scope and observed three tracks, at 20, 25 and 30 miles
heading outbound. After checking with the Identification Section, I was
able to identify one track as a Constellation. Idaho #1 being airborne
at the time on a test flight, was diverted from over Kirtland to identify
the other two tracks and also to search for any unusual objects. Idaho #1
was vectored to 350 degrees and 11 angels and at approximately 35 miles
one track was identified as a Piper Cub. Idaho one continued for the sec-
ond track on a heading of 260 degrees and at 50 miles, identified a C-47.
The third track at this time was 270 degrees and 85 miles.

I received word that the object was still in sight so had Idaho #1
climb to 23 angels and search on an inbound heading. He came within 15
miles of the field without sighting anything and since the object was
still in sight from the ground, he was again vectored outbound on a track
of 254 degrees at 18 angels.

When at 50 miles, he reported fuel running low, he was vectored to-
ward the base at minimum altitude and landed.

Idaho #1 reported excellent visibility with the only clouds 50 miles
West of Kirtland Air Force Base, with tops estimated at 17,000 feet.

At no time was there an indication other than the three outbound
tracks, with the exception of Idaho #1.

SWORN STATEMENT

I, [redacted], Lt. USAF, 135th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn statement:

At 1600 MST, Friday 23 May 1952, an object was sighted approximately 260 degrees, West of Building T-1420, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.

Object was light in color reflecting the sunlight intermittently. Bright for periods varying from 3 seconds to 2 or 3 minutes. Remaining dark for like periods of time as though slowly circling. Object did not vary it's position horizontally more than 5 degrees.

Object was under constant surveillance from 1605 MST to 1625 MST. Object was viewed through a pair of 7 X 50 binoculars and the telescope of a transit but due to the distance which was approximately 12 to 20 miles recognition was impossible.

Toward the end of the observing period the object slowly decended below the horizon and out of sight.

Interception was attempted with negative results.

SWORN STATEMENT

I, Captain USAF, **** 135th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn statement:

On 23 May 1952 at 1600 hours, a shiny airborne object was called to my attention. This object was approximately 260 degrees from KAFB, appeared to be heading west and was approximately 3,000 feet above the terrain. It appeared to be 15–20 miles from KAFB and because of this distance no definite shape could be determined. However, because of the reflections, which were continuous, the surface could have been aluminum.

This was called to the attention of the Gladwin Senior Director who had already received instructions from the Chief Controller at ADC to investigate. This object remained in sight about 40 minutes during which time an Idaho flight, which was airborne, was diverted to investigate. Since we had no radar contact with the object, the direction of the Idaho aircraft was based on ground observation. A land line was run from the observer to the dais at Gladwin ATC.

Despite the fact that the Idaho aircraft was dead reckoned and directed to the position with relation to a cloud bank, the interception of this object was not successful. After about 25 minutes the Idaho flight, low on fuel, returned to KAFB for Pancake.

Lieutenant Colonel, United States Air Force,
do hereby make the following statement as a disinterested party.

On or about 1600 hours, 23 May 1952, my attention was called by Lieutenant [blacked out] to a strange object at 2600 Azimuth, this Station. This object appeared to me to be approximately one to two thousand feet above the terrain at a range of ten to twenty miles. It did not have any apparent motion other than random motion. I looked at it once through field glasses and it appeared to be silver in color, flat on the bottom, slightly rounded on the upper edge, but the highest portion of the rounded section was offset to the left.

Captain [blacked out] arrived at this time and the object was pointed out to him. I had called the Direction Center by this time and asked what action had been taken. I was informed that a fighter was now vectoring on 260.

Captain [blacked out], Lieutenant [blacked out] and I went to the Direction Center and observed the object from the Radar Maintenance room window. Mr. [blacked out] was by that time observing the object through a transit telescope. I directed that a line be run from the controller to the observers position which was done within the next two or three minutes. By that time, however, the object had drifted below the horizon and was not again observed by me.

I have on two previous occasions observed objects in the air which I subsequently decided were merely large pieces of paper. This time, however, I can not convince myself that this was either an airplane outbound, a paper object, or a balloon.

The following statement is my opinion of the reliability of the witnesses:

Captain ——————--thoroughly reliable.

Lieutenant————--thoroughly reliable.

Mr.————--reliable but statement must be considered in the light of his late observance of the object. He did not study it as long as the others.

Lieutenant————--reliable but is conyiced that the object was an outbound plane even though there is no evidence that a Constellation would have been in that area at that time.

SILFI STATENEII

I, PhiICO Technician; Control and Warning Squadron, 135th AC&W Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn state-
ment:

At about 1600 EST, Friday 23 May 1952, my attention was called to a bright object in the western sky. A transit was available in Fair Main-
tenance Section, and using this instrument, I attempted to identify the above mentioned object. Although plainly visible to the naked eye be-
cause of its brilliance, the object was still too small to be identified using the telescope on the transit. Attempts to identify the object with
the aid of a pair of 7 X 50 binoculars were also unsuccessful.

This object was observed for about forty-five minutes during which time it appeared to be floating in the air and moved about in a random
fashion. When first observed, it was about 2 degrees above the horizon and almost due West of Building T-120. (Azimuth 268 degrees). Total change
of position did not exceed 5 degrees horizontally or 3 degrees vertically. No rapid changes in position were observed.

Toward the end of the period of observation, the object's angle of
elevation decreased rather steadily and at the same time its brilliance
decreased until it became invisible at or near the horizon, bearing about
271 degrees. Brilliance of this object changed continuously during ob-
servation, being bright for periods of two seconds to two minutes, and
very dim, sometimes invisible, for like periods. Change in brilliance was
gradual.

Motion of this object rules out the possibility of it being an air-
plane or meteor. Other possibilities are:
1. Helicopter: No helicopters known to be in the area.
2. Flying Saucer: No comments.
3. Piece of paper soaring on thermals: Possibly taken aloft by a
whirl-wind. Exploding motion and changing brilliances. Cannot be
discounted because of high brilliance of observed object. Sun-
light on fleeting paper results in an unusually brilliant object,
when viewed with the sky as a background.

It is my opinion that the object sighted was a piece of paper.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 Yrs.
