1st Ltr 200-5, dtd 29 April 1952

GENERAL INFORMATION:

At aprx 1205, 9 July 1953, A/2C, 3750th Group, Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, Texas, was standing on the 5th Street hospital ramp in the hospital area during his lunch period, when he made around 'ym two (2) B-29 type aircraft flying westwardly, caused him to look up.

Upon looking up, he saw an object appear in the sky at a very high altitude. The object on its initial appearance appeared to be circular in sight, and was aprx one and five tenths (1.5) inches in diameter (as observed with his naked eye). The thickness of the object could not be determined. The object began losing altitude at a very fast rate of speed, but continued to travel in a Northwest to Southeast direction. The height of the object when it appeared at its lowest altitude could not be determined, but appeared much higher than the nearest flying in the immediate vicinity.

(Note: It is estimated that the aircraft were flying at an altitude of aprx 7000, feet.) The radius distance of the object as observed by the source was aprx eight (8) inches. It was also observed at this point that the object appeared to be somewhat horizontal, flying on its side, and at its lowest altitude appeared to be elliptical in shape, and slightly conical on the top and bottom sides.

The color was silvery-white with what appeared to be a phosphorescent glow. The object was observed at this altitude for aprx one (1) second, then it suddenly began climbing at a very fast rate of speed and travelling in a Southwest direction and passed over the neighboring hospital area.

No vapor trails nor any kind of smoke were emitted by the object during the course of observation. Although unable to judge the speed of the object, polar stated that it traveled at almost the speed of a falling star.

NOTES: The following signed statement was submitted to this Headquarters by the undersigned in his own words.

at 1205 hours, 9 July 1953, I, A/2c [name redacted] at the 5oth Street hospital range of the Base hospital, 3750th Medical Group, was a patient in the 4th Ward, Building 1, Room 2, looking upward. I am the (2) B-29 type aircraft flying in a westward direction, after a few seconds a strange flying object appeared in the sky and I followed it with my eyes during its course of travel. It appeared to be a circular disc more when I first observed it, some (1) inch in diameter. The object appeared to increase in size as it came closer to me from a very high altitude. The circular shape of the object seemed to change to elliptical, the closer it became. The object was traveling in a southwest direction, at a very fast unknown rate of speed, much faster than I have ever seen an aircraft. After having seen the object for some five (5) seconds, I reported it to the Base Facilities.

The object when it first appeared seemed to be flying at a much higher altitude than the two (2) aircraft that were flying in the immediate area, and it appeared to be traveling somewhat parallel to the ground across the sky. The fact that the object was spinning horizontally and yet traveling with a forward motion caused me to observe it as an aircraft.

The object at its largest point appeared to be eight (8) inches in diameter as I observed it with my naked eye. The color of the object was white, (1) white, somewhat like a white cloud. It was a clear day, that made the object appear to be bright and full at the same time. It traveled from the northwest to the southwest, but fearing an orbit to the northwest. It also appeared to have made a vertical passage before disappearing over neighboring buildings. As it came closer the object seemed to slow down considerably, and then it suddenly gained altitude again, and disappeared at a very fast rate of speed.

The following statement was submitted by A/2C [redacted] of the 3750th Medical Group, Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, Texas. Airman was on duty at the time of the sighting.

"At 1205 hours, 9 July 1953, I, A/2C [redacted] of the 3750th Medical Group, Headquarters Squadron Section, Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, Texas, was sitting outside of the 5th Street hospital area building two (2) B-25 type aircraft, told so to look at a flying object coming from the Northwest, and was moving westwardly. The two (2) B-25 type aircraft suspended flying training and were observing the altitude of the object, but it was very much higher than the aircraft was travelling. The object was white, and appeared to be considerable speed for a few seconds and then suddenly began moving to the Southwest and then over the base again using speed and altitude. The object was white, and appeared to be phosphorescent. Observation of the object was from five (5) to seven (7) - eight (8) inches in diameter when at its lowest altitude, and could be seen 18 inches above the roof of neighboring buildings in the hospital area."

NOTE: The following is a statement of observations from A/20 Navigator.
All distances and measurements are approximate.

"At appr 1205 hours, 9 July 1953, I, [redacted] was returning from dinner to the 3750th Medical Group, Headquarters Squadron Section, Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, Texas, when I stopped on the hospital ramp with 1/20 A/20 aircraft flying over the hospital area. An we turned to observe them, A/20 was an object overhead and turned to me and said, 'There's a flying Saucer'. Being curious of the matter I turned quickly and saw what I believed to be a Flying Saucer. Then the object first appeared in was very high speed, spinning rapidly in flight. This object appeared to be the shape of a chrome disc. It made no sound, and I was very much startled. At the largest point, the object seemed to be about eight (8) inches in diameter.

The object came from the northwest, traveling towards the southwest, orbiting to the northwest. The color of the object was a highly polished aluminum. I have never seen anything quite like it before and traveling at such a rate of speed."
