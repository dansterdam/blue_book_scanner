METEOR ROCK HITS CAR ON NEW JERSEY HIGHWAY: A rock or meteorite the size of a softball hit a 15-year-old girl riding in a car on the Pulaski Skyway near Newark, New Jersey, last Feb.4th. The rock crashed through the windshield and screamed off the left nearly causing her father, John Watson, to lose control of the car. The object was identified as a meteorite by officials of the Newark Weather Bureau. A mineralogist said that 99 percent of the time, meteorites are ordinarily found in rocks of north Jersey. An official of the Museum of Natural History and Hayden Planetarium identified the object as an ordinary piece of rock. The case was investigated by a successful researcher of various reports of this nature.

CLOSE SIGHTING MADE BY A COUPLE DRIVING ON JERSEY SHORE:
A couple, who wished to allow their names to be used in the papers, stated
that on the night of Feb. 6th they watched a saucer do maneuvers over their
car for nearly half an hour, while driving near Somers Point, New Jersey. The
woman said that at one time the object was so close above them that "a good
rifle could not hit it." She said that it seemed round but because of the angle it
was shaped "like a kidney bean." Sometimes it stood still, and then would move
slowly, quickening its speed until it was soaring "faster than a jet." It appeared to be making or metal. The object had a bright center and a glow toward and
and there would be a bright light in the center and a glow around it. At another time it would go straight up in the air with a bright light above it and
a glowing tail like a meteor. Their final statement was, "We don't know what their sudden
dark."

Pg. 12 - Ft. Worth, Missouri - Newspaper editor Bo Sterling and his wife saw two white discs flying in the sky, appeared to be at a great distance and were first sighted north of the city. They appeared to be rather large in size and were silvery in color and remained stationary in the same direction and stayed the same distance apart.

Aeronautical Chart & Information Photo Library
number B-163969 A.C.

original source of photo unknown (photo taken
during Air Show--)

A low-flying jet, enveloped in an aura of cloud made by the jet
itself, can look like a strange object. This condensation phenomenon,
called contrafl, occurs when areas of low pressure develop on the
wing surface, the air cools by expansion in the slowly moving
boundary layer in contact with the wing. The depth of the boundary
layer and the drop in pressure both increase with increasing air
speed, but each depends very closely on the aerodynamic qualities
of the wing. An excellent photograph of one such disk produced
by a Canberra jet was taken on February 4, 1956, along the coast
of Africa near Accra on a morning when the condensation phenomenon occurred several times during air maneuvers. The weather was
fine, the sky cloudless with a few patches of haze over the sea, and
visibility was more than eight miles. During the display the air
speed of the jets was usually too low or the air too dry for the aura
to form. "But over the cliff edge where the sea-breeze was just
beginning to break through in patches the air would be moist enough
to condense about 1½ gm. of water droplets in each cubic metre
of air, quite sufficient to produce the observed effect. The effect
is increased by higher speeds at the end of a dive (when the
angle of incidence of the aerofoil is least) . . . but it is likely that
the patchy onset of the sea-breeze was the most important contributing factor." [7]

Exhibit "J"

JET AT HIGH SPEED IN A FOG - SHROUDED SKY

The image shows several silhouetted figures viewed from behind, looking up at a jet aircraft flying in a foggy sky.


- page 17 -

The image shows a black and white photograph of several people viewed from behind, looking up at a long, slender object ascending into a hazy sky. The object appears to be a rocket or missile launching vertically. The people are silhouetted, with their backs to the camera, watching the object rise into the sky.
