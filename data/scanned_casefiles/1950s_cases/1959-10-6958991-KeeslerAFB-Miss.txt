To them:

This morning while two other airmen and I were walking to breakfast was noticed the flying star. There about five degrees north-west over something that after a moment was sighted was not the moon. It was a patch of light about the size of the moon or a little larger, and as we watched, the object seemed to signal. When the periphery had moved out, the original patch the size of the moon was left, but its color started to change from white to orange. This happened at about 5:52 AM, CST.

If something the Russians are doing, I will observe about it. In my view, perhaps you will welcome report from mine place.

Very truly yours,

[Note: The top and bottom lines are blacked out, likely redacting names or other identifying information]

One of the scenes I saw with a spherical, haze over it. We saw it, that it was an extreme expansion in width, open. That was the only explanation one could think of. We thought it was obviously something outside the atmosphere. We thought it was obviously something outside the atmosphere.
