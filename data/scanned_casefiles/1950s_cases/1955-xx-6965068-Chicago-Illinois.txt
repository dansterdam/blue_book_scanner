Dear Sirs,

Back in 1954 I sighted several U F O's, along with my brother and several other people, while playing in a park on the Northwest side of Chicago.

After sighting them, I ran home and grabbed my camera. When I returned they (the U F O's) were still there. My brother and I then went to the top of a fire escape on a school to get a better look at them. It was then when I took a picture.

When I had the film developed I saw what seemed to be some form of aircraft. However to this day I still can't figure out just what it is.

If you are still interested in U F O reports you may write me and I will be happy to give you more information on this sighting plus the print of the picture since I lost the negative.

Very truly yours,

It was suggested to send this picture to you for evaluation.
If you find it to be nothing at all don't think I'm nuts
because I am not, its just that I'm curious to find out what
it is.

If you think it might be something I will look for the
negative. However if its nothing please return the photo.
Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.

Yours truly,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 5 April 1960 together with your included monographic print of a possible unidentified flying object.

The photographic is in very poor condition and if positive identification is to be made, we will have to have the negative in order to analyze this particular sighting.

In addition, we will need more information with regard to this sighting. We will need a description of the camera and the lens which was used to take the picture, and the Air Force Questionnaire enclosed herewith should be carefully completed with respect to this UFO sighting.
