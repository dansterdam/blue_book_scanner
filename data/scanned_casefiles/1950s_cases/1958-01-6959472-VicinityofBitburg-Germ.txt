OUTPUT OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

THIS INITIAL BRILLIANCE OF THE UFO'S APPEARANCE
WAS TO LAST ONLY A BRIEF PERIOD. AS IT CONTINUED TO 
VISIBLE IT'S INTENSITY GRADUALLY DIMINISHED AND 
IT'S VISUAL SIZE APPEARED TO BECOME SMALLER.  IT 
THEN EMITTED A BRIGHT LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO BE A 
LIGHT SCREAM AT THE TOP OF THE CONE. THIS LIGHT
SCARCELY HAD A VISUAL EFFECT ON THE OBSERVERS. IT
SEEMED TO BE ONLY A PROJECTION OF LIGHT FROM THE 
CONE-SHAPED OBJECT. THIS LIGHT WAS NOT REFLECTED 
IN THE OBSERVERS' EYES. THERE WAS NO APPARENT CHANGE
IN THEIR PUPILS.  ALTHOUGH A SOCIAL LOCKOUT OF 
VISION DUE TO BRIGHT LIGHT DOES OCCUR UNDER CERTAIN
CONDITIONS, THIS EFFECT WAS NOT NOTICED IN THIS
INSTANCE. THE CONTROL, PAR T I'D PHYSICAL STATE OF 
THE OBSERVERS REMAINED NORMAL THROUGHOUT THE INCIDENT.
FURTHER REPORT OF SUBJ ECTS USED SIGHTING WILL 
BE SUBMITTED AT A LATER DATE. 
THIS CONCLUDES THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORT SUBMITTED BY
THE 2D TO P.I. REPORTING CENTER.
