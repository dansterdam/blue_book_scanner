TRANSCRIPTION:

O.K.. We are hereby making the following report regarding the observation of a strange aerial object which was sighted on the evening of 7 October, 1956. The incident occurred in the vicinity of the Cincinnati, Ohio suburb of Blue Ash.

At approximately 8:30 p.m. on the evening in question, two separate observers, who were not acquainted with one another, simultaneously sighted a strange aerial object in the sky. One observer was Mr. John Smith, who was standing outside his home in Blue Ash. The other observer was Mrs. Mary Jones, who was driving her automobile on a local road in the Blue Ash area.

Both observers described the object as being oval or disc-shaped, and estimated its size to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object was observed to be silently hovering or suspended in the air at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet. The object was illuminated, with a bright white light emanating from its surface. After being observed for several minutes, the object suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

Subsequent investigation revealed no evidence of any conventional aircraft or other known aerial vehicle in the area at the time of the sighting. We are therefore classifying this incident as an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) pending any further information that may come to light.

A diagram and photographs of the object as described by the observers are attached for reference.

This concludes our report on this UFO sighting incident.
