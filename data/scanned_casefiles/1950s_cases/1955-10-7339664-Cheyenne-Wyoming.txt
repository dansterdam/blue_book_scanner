I. SOURCE: Address: Cheyenne, Wyoming
Age: 23 years
Occupation: Insurance salesman
Education: 12 years

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: The SOURCE's credentials and information provided by the individuals who interviewed him suggest that he is a reliable and qualified commercial pilot. His account of the sighting is technically detailed and corresponds to the information obtained from other sources regarding the same incidents.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On Sunday, 16 October 1955, at 2000 hours, Mountain Standard Time, SOURCE and companions observed a strange object in the sky. It was described as being cylindrical in shape, approximately 50 to 60 feet in length, and 8 to 10 feet in diameter. It was illuminated by a very bright, bluish-green light which seemed to be emitted from the object itself. Both men then proceeded up the back road for approximately one-half mile. 

JUAN CHORA, similar to that of four (4) turbine type engines, approaching from the southeast at high speed and an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. As the object came closer, the noise increased. The SOURCE outlined sharply against the stars, although the SOURCE could not ascertain the exact contours of the strange object due to the brilliance of the light. The object appeared to be solid material with no lights or illumination. Mr. SOURCE stated that he was of the opinion that the object must have some form of propulsion and was headlight-like in appearance.

A bi-motored SOURCE stated that the noise of the bi-jet drowned out the sound of the object as it passed. Mr. SOURCE heard the whining - the object, for an estimated ten (10) seconds and seconds, the object had passed. The SOIIRCE was of the opinion that it covered the distance in approximately 15 to 20 seconds. He searched the area for the deer he had killed but could not find it. The SOURCE was not in the belief that the disappearance of the deer was connected with the object he had observed.

The report states that the source may be considered a reliable source, but also notes several contradictory statements and unsubstantiated claims. It describes the source's sighting of an unidentified flying object, including details about the sound and movements of the object. The report concludes by stating that the sound of the object, in intensity, was that of four to six 8-17 type aircraft on take-off.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. The sighting was another located approximately 300 yards northeast of the area where the original sighting occurred. It was described as a high-powered rifle shot at approximately 2000 hours on 6 October 1955, but had no unusual flying objects associated with it.

2. Mrs. A., a rancher's sister-in-law of the above rancher, residing at the same location, revealed nothing unusual regarding the sighting.

3. Lt. Colonel G. A. T., a rancher (name withheld), located approximately 200 yards east of the area where the original sighting occurred, stated that he saw nothing during the evening of the sighting, but did state that he heard an aircraft pass overhead "a few minutes before 8:00 P.M. on 16 October 1955". The investigator was unable to identify the aircraft observed.

4. Mr. B., a resident of the area, who allegedly observed a sand storm during the sighting, stated that he thought he saw the beam of a searchlight, but was not sure. The investigator could find no evidence to substantiate the claim of the SIGHTING.

5. Lt. Colonel E. H. Rogers, Deputy Commander of Civil Defense, State of Wyoming, stated that various individuals reported unusual sounds or unidentified flying objects for 15 October 1955. Colonel Rogers revealed that no unusual sounds or any unusual flying objects were reported to him during that evening.

6. Lt. Colonel H. Miller, Cheyenne Police Department, was interviewed. Lt. Miller stated that no reports of unusual sights or sounds had been received by the Cheyenne Police Department relative to the evening of 16 October 1955.

7. Mr. Warren H. Schroeder, Air Force Police, was on guard duty at the Kent Gate, Warren AFB, Cheyenne, Wyoming, when he allegedly observed the sighting. He was interviewed and stated that he did not observe or hear anything unusual during the evening of 16 October 1955.

8. Mr. A. reporter for the CHEYENNE EAGLE TRIBUNE, was interviewed. Mr. B. was the original reporter from the CHEYENNE EAGLE TRIBUNE who had interviewed the original investigator with the exception that Mr. B. claimed to have observed the sighting. The investigator advised Mr. B. that the report would not be released to the media since the original investigator had doubted the veracity of the report.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT:
LOCATION OF OBJECT: Cheyenne, Wyoming
AGENCY: USAF
DATE: 7 OCTOBER 1955
PAGE: 6 OF 7 PAGES

The text in the document is as follows:

CONTENTS OF FORWARDING OFFICER

1. The reliability of both observers and therefore the validity of their reports cannot be questioned.

2. The face, shape and motion of the object observed was essentially as described by the observers and the conclusions drawn from the observation are substantial.

3. Insofar as intense as described by the sources.

4. The object was observed and seen in the sky for a considerably period of time and there is no reason to question that the object was there no object but then denied.

5. In view of the retraction by Mr. _________ that he had seen the object, the investigator could find no one who had definite information as to whether any object had been seen over Cheyenne but the investigators could find no one who could either confirm or deny the observations.

6. Information received from Mr. ________ places a diesel-electric locomotive, containing six Sherman-type, 10-cylinder, diesel-electric locomotive miles south of the area at the time of the sighting. Information received from the Operator indicates that a freight train was moving to the south at the time of the sighting, the locomotive being fired up and ready for an evening run, and the speed of the train could have been high enough to account for the speed described in the report.

7. When accounts were received of the sightings by the same observers on several occasions which were very similar to the first one, it was concluded that the object passing to the south sometimes sounded "strange".

SOURCES have overactive imaginations, and the data and conclusions drawn above it is believed that no object was actually sighted, but rather the observers saw and heard the diesel-electric locomotive passing to the south, which is the probable explanation of the "unidentified" object.
