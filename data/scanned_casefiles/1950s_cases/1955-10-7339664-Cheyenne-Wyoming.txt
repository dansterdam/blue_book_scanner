I. SOURCE:
Address: [redacted], Cheyenne, Wyoming
Age: 23 years
Occupation: Insurance salesman
Education: 12 years
Qualifications: Commercial pilot, 450 hours; Reg AF, 4 years, AP

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was extremely cooperative, even profuse in answering the questions of the investigator. Mr. [redacted] is a qualified commercial airlines pilot and claims thorough knowledge of the configuration and flight characteristics of most aircraft. The description of the sighting obtained telephonically prior to the personal interview was highly exaggerated compared to the description obtained by the personal interview. Upon questioning, the SOURCE gave many conflicting statements of the events of the sighting. SOURCE tends to emphasize the more spectacular aspects of the sighting and has an active imagination. The SOURCE was very talkative, which were not worn at the time of the sighting. SOURCE is considered to be of [remainder cut off]

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. Sunday, 16 October 1955, at 2000 hours, Mountain Standard Time, SOURCE and companion, Mr. [redacted], while in an automobile, were poaching for deer by means of a spotlight. SOURCE on Mr. [redacted]'s automobile, shot and killed a deer. Both men then proceeded up the back road for approximately one-half mile.

2. FJAM 0607), SOURCE and companion searched for the deer. While searching, Mr. [redacted] heard a noise similar to that of four (4) turbine type engines, approaching from the ears. Mr. [redacted] frightened by the intense noise from the object, jumped into the ravine. From the ravine the SOURCE looked up and saw a large black object overhead, sharply against the stars. Although the SOURCE could not ascertain the shape of the object, he stated it was approximately the size of an automobile and 50 to 60 feet over his head. He described the object as being a "dark glob of material with no lights or illumination". Mr. [redacted] stated that he was of the opinion that the object must have come from somewhere and was heading west at a "tremendous" speed, faster than any jet aircraft he had seen.

3. SOURCE stated that the noise of the object drowned out the sound of a bi-motored aircraft passing overhead.

4. Mr. [redacted] heard the whining of the object for an estimated ten (10) seconds and saw the object for five (5) seconds. The SOURCE estimated the time to be 2015 hours, 16 October 1955.

5. After the object had passed Mr. [redacted] searched the area for the deer he had killed but could not find it. SOURCE was positive in the belief that the disappearance of the animal was directly attributable to the object he had observed for he was certain he had killed the deer earlier.

I. SOURCE:
Address: [redacted], Cheyenne, Wyoming
Age: 23 years
Occupation: Heavy equipment operator
Education: 12 years
Qualifications: USMC, 2 years

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE may be considered [redacted] due to many contradictory statements, continual reference to the object as a "flying saucer" and self-admittance to being a "fanuer enthusiast". SOURCE stated he knows the characteristics of "saucers" from science fiction literature and comic books. SOURCE continually seemed surprised, indicating the amount of influence held by the SOURCE in PART ONE and the influencing factor of talking over the sighting phenomenon.

SOURCE heard the object as well as heard the sound of the object but upon questioning stated that he had seen the object only. SOURCE had noted many continue over the Cheyenne area on the days immediately following his sighting and was certain that this was Air Force activity. SOURCE stated the object had been five minutes fast or slow.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. SOURCE'S description of the object paralleled that of [redacted] with the exception of the following items:

a. SOURCE heard the whining sound of the object for a period of forty-five (45) seconds, but did not see the object.

b. SOURCE glanced at his watch immediately after the object passed overhead and noted that the luminous dial of the watch was glowing brighter than he had ever seen before. SOURCE attributed this phenomenon to radioactivity from the object.

c. SOURCE stated that the time was exactly 2015 hours but stated that he was not quite sure.

d. SOURCE stated that the sound of the object, in intensity, was that of four to six B-47 type aircraft on take-off.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. Mr. [redacted], a rancher located approximately 300 yards north-west of the area of the sighting, was interviewed. Mr. [redacted] further stated that he was not reading at the time of the sighting. Mr. [redacted] further stated that he heard the sound of a high-powered rifle at approximately 7:00 hours on 16 October 1955 but had at no time during the evening of 16 October 1955 noticed any unusual flying objects or heard any unusual or loud sounds.

2. Mrs. [redacted], sister-in-law of the above rancher, residing at the same location, heard nothing unusual or saw no unusual objects during the evening of the sighting.

3. A rancher (name withheld), located approximately 200 yards east of the area of the sighting was interviewed. The rancher stated that he had heard nothing unusual during the evening of the sighting, but did state that he had an aircraft pass overhead between 1930 and 2030 hours on 16 October 1955. The investigator was informed that Union Pacific locomotives passing one and one-half miles south of the location of the sighting sometimes sounded "weird".

4. Scene of the sighting was visited by the investigator and Mr. [redacted]. Although the deer shot by Mr. [redacted] purportedly rolled down a sandy bank of the ravine, no trace, blood, or markings could be found to substantiate the claim of the SOURCE.

5. Lt. Colonel E.L. Rogers, Deputy Commander of Civil Defense, State of Wyoming, was interviewed. Colonel Rogers stated that the Cheyenne CGC Post was inoperative at the time of the sighting. He also stated that his organization had received no reports of unusual sounds or unidentified flying objects for 16 October 1955. Colonel Rogers suggested that Mr. [redacted] be located one-half miles north-west of Cheyenne, be contacted. Mr. [redacted] was contacted and stated that he had heard no unusual sounds or had seen no unusual flying objects during the evening of 16 October 1955.

6. Lt. Miller, Cheyenne Police Department, was interviewed. Lt. Miller stated that no reports of unusual flying objects or sounds had been received by his organization. He further stated that his men on duty outside at the time of the sighting had not reported seeing or hearing anything unusual during the evening of 16 October 1955.

7. A/3C Joseph M. Schroeder, Air Force Police, on guard duty at the East Gate, Warren AFB, Cheyenne, Wyoming, was interviewed. A/3C Schroeder stated that he had neither seen nor heard anything unusual during the evening of 16 October 1955.

8. Mr. [redacted], reporter for the CHEYENNE EAGLE TRIBUNE, was interviewed. Mr. [redacted] stated that he had received the verbal report he received from the SOURCES. The description was comparable to the description given to the investigator with the exception that Mr. [redacted] claimed to have seen the object. Mr. [redacted] stated that he referred the SOURCES to the local Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA). Mr. [redacted] also stated that he did not give newspaper coverage to the report because he doubted the veracity of the report.

9. Mr. William D. Olsen, CAA control tower operator, Cheyenne Municipal Airport, on duty at the time the SOURCES reported the sighting to his organization, was interviewed. Mr. Olsen stated that he interviewed the SOURCES and prepared the original [remainder of text cut off]

10. Mr. Robert Baxter, CAA control tower operator, Cheyenne Municipal Airport, on duty at the time SOURCE reported their sighting, was interviewed. The description given to Mr. Baxter by both SOURCES was very similar to the description given to the investigator with the exception that Mr. Baxter claimed to have seen the object. Mr. Baxter stated that both SOURCES seemed very well composed and that neither SOURCE seemed to be shaken by the sighting or the events surrounding the sighting. Mr. Baxter, when interviewed telephonically one day prior to the personal interview, seemed to be excited and shaken even though the sighting had taken place a day previous to the phone interview.

11. Mr. Johanson, Stationmaster, Union Pacific Depot, Cheyenne, Wyoming, was interviewed. Mr. Johanson was queried as to the departure and arrival times of any trains on the evening of the sighting. Investigator was informed that train number F7 had departed Cheyenne, heading west, at 2005 hours, 16 October 1955, and had passed approximately one and one-half miles south of the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting. The investigator was referred to Mr. Sherman, Special Agent, Union Pacific Railroad, for further information.

12. Mr. Sherman, Special Agent, Union Pacific Railroad, was interviewed. Mr. Sherman verified the fact that train number #7, engine number 987, passed approximately one and one-half miles south of the area of the sighting, at 2020 hours, 16 October 1955. The investigator was further informed that the engine of train number #7 was composed of three units, each unit containing two Diesel-electric engines. Mr. Sherman stated that trains heading west out of Cheyenne are forced to apply full power to negotiate the steep climb to the summit of the mountains west of Cheyenne. It was learned that the sound of six Diesel-electric engines with full power applied would carry far many miles, especially in the mountains and with a wind supporting the sound waves.

14. Mrs. Georgia Bassett, U.S. Weather Bureau, Cheyenne, Wyoming, was interviewed. Investigator was informed that the surface winds in the area of the sighting were from the south southeast at two (2) knots and that the sky was cloudless at the time of the sighting. Ceiling and visibility was unlimited except by darkness.

FROM: (LOCATION)                REPORT NO.                   PAGE 6 OF 7 PAGES
Hq., MATS                       F102-0053-55

COMMENTS of Preparing Officers:

1. The reliability of both observers and therefore the validity of their reports can be deemed "poor".

2. The fact that the incident was located within 300 yards of the sighting, heard initially after wild claims by Mr. [redacted] to ghost the area, but did not substantiate the absence of an object emitting a sound with the intensity of fact to cite in (4) type district. Similar statements by other people in the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting substantiate the lack of sound.

3. In view of the above it must be assured that there was no object emitting a sound as in source as described by the SOURCES.

4. Mr. [redacted], originally reported that he had seen the object, but then denied that he had seen the object when interviewed by the investigator. Mr. [redacted] at a later date telephonically stated that he was sure he had seen the object by getting a fix on it against the background of stars. Although he could not define the exact position of the object, he did not wear his eyeglasses at the time of the sighting, although he is definite he saw them.

5. In view of the retraction by Mr. [redacted] that he had seen the object, the discrepancies in Mr. [redacted]'s story, and the fact that the investigator could find no one who had or heard such an object, leaves great doubt as to whether any object had actually been seen.

6. Information received from Mr. Sherman places a Diesel-electric locomotive, containing six Diesel-electric engines under full power, one and one-half miles south of the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting. Information received from the Cheyenne Weather Bureau indicates that the surface winds from the south south-east would have acted as a sound carrier of "whining" of the Diesel locomotive passing to the south at the sound pitch of the sighting. The cool evening air and the topography of the land would tend to accentuate sound of the locomotive.

7. Both SOURCES described the sound emitted from the object as being similar to a turbine, a sound very similar to that of Diesel-electric engines.

8. A local rancher stated that the Union Pacific trains passing to the south sometimes sounded "weird".

9. In view of the discrepancies in the SOURCES' stories, the fact that both SOURCES have contradictory imaginations, and the data and conclusions drawn above, it is herewith submitted that no object actually existed and the sound, being built up in the imagination of the SOURCES, was in reality that of the Diesel locomotive passing to the south.
