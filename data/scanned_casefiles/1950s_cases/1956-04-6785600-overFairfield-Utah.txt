STATEMENT

17 April 1956

I, Thomas P. Petits, Captain, USAFR, AO-770390, do hereby make the following statement in reference to an unidentified flying object which has been a matter of concern to me since 17 March 1956 and have no objection to this statement being attached to the 313th Fighter Bomber Squadron (Reserve) at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.

On 16 April 1956 at approximately 1930 MST while on an IFR, 14,000 feet mission at 37,000 feet, I sighted an unidentified flying object. My position at the time was aircraft heading 230 degrees direct from Kirkland AFB. I had the object in sight for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object was a bright silver color and was illuminated as a bright silver ball or globe. The object appeared to be larger than a car as it was falling or plummeting at a high rate of speed down from the canopy of my aircraft, passing my head around the cockpit and disappearing from sight into the overcast below the aircraft. In addition, the object increased in size and a change of color became more distinct as it approached, appearing as a bright silver ball and then diminishing in size and changing to a dull grayish color as it went out of sight. The object was originally closely observed for a possible disabled or disabled aircraft. After discerning that the object was traveling either 1,000 ft/sec or left and was at the 12 o'clock position as inbound to me, I went on instruments. While inbound, the object continued on a collision course. While under instruments, the object disappeared from my sights. I never lost visual contact on the object except when the aircraft went into the overcast. It did not return to the same general location, and the sighting was self-terminated. I am sure I did not pursue the object any further, since it was not seen again.

REPORT FORMAT AFR 200-2

1. Since it was night flight, the discernible outline of the object could not be determined. The side could have illuminated to give an impression of size or shape, but this is only a supposition and could not be determined periodically. There was only one object. There were no discernible features, contours, trails or other identifiable features except the changing lights and the strange movements.

2. The object was first noted as a bright light and identified as a normal aircraft, but its rapid acceleration and unusual flight pattern caused me to closely observe it. The elevation angle would be estimated as 290 degrees. The flight pattern was from left to right and approximately over Wendover, Utah. The flight pattern was from left to right.

Transcribing the text in the document:

1. It states that the object observed was more horizontal than vertical with no regular pattern. The speed would be estimated to be very rapid and irregular, one which no aircraft could accomplish. The object did not disappear until it penetrated the overcast into Salt Lake City Radio. The object was in my sight for approximately 25 minutes.

2. The sighting was part of Serial 53-2057 as 37,000 feet on a heading of 290 degrees at an indicated air speed of 250 k. Home station is Hillafb.

3. The light conditions were between the hours of 1950 to 2015 EST. The light conditions were excellent for sighting. It was a clear night. I was 1,000 feet on top and the object was several thousand feet very brilliant. It was however night and distances are very hard to accurately establish.

4. The object was oval-shaped and illuminated. Then from a distance the object became dimmer, then brighter again with a reading of 250 degrees and the object was first sighted 20 minutes out of Fairfield and lasting 10 minutes and went out from a reading of 313 degrees inbound to Salt Lake City and into the overcast.

5. Thomas F. Patit, Captain USAFRES, 113th Fighter Bomber Squadron (Reserve) Operational Officer, 113th Fighter Bomber Squadron.
