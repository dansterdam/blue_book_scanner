10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One object, no discernible outline or features, about the size of a base-ball held at arm's length. Changed colors fm blue to white periodically.

First appeared to be, & identified as a blinking light. The object appeared to be at 40,000 feet on an azimuth of +290 dgrs. Obj appeared to have an erratic course in the West.

*ATIC Comment: Star Almanac & Ephemeris plot indicate Venus almost precisely in boat high altitude, through a/c windshield. Celestial body appears to move over horizontally due to slight "yawing" & movement of a/c on its axes.

11. COMMENTS
Copy of preliminary rpt attached. Due to the duration of the sighting, the position of the UFOB as compared w/the position of *Venus at the time of the sighting, the colors of the obj & the circumstances of the sighting; the obj in question was probably the planet Venus.

STATEMENT

17 April 1956

I, Thomas P. Poth, Captain, USAF, AO-770390, do hereby make the following statement of the sighting of an unidentified flying object. I have been a rated flying officer since March 1946 and have approximately 1,300 total flying hours. 230 am in jet aircraft. I am presently assigned to the 313th Fighter Bomber Squadron (Reserve) at Hill Air Force Base in the capacity of Operations Officer.

On 16 April 1956 at approximately 1950 MST while on an IFR, 1,000 feet on top night flight from Kirtland Air Force Base to Hill Air Force Base at 37,000 feet, I sighted an unidentified flying object at the first sighting was inbound to Fairfield, Utah on a heading of 290 degrees direct from Kirtland AFB. I had this object in sight for approximately 25 minutes. The object was a bright white light in an altitude of 23 minutes after turning off the cockpit lights and eliminating the possibility of interior lighting being reflected from the canopy, moving my head around the cockpit and checking my gun sight switch in the OFF position. In addition, the object increased in size and a change of color became more distinct as I drew closer and the perception of the object's distinct movements became apparent. The color changed from very white to very dim brown but not in any standard sequence. The object was originally closely observed for the possibility of it being another aircraft. After discerning that the object was not traveling either right or left and being in the 12 o'clock position to my line of flight, it was observed more closely for the possibility of a collision course. While inbound to Fairfield, the object continued to grow in size and the diameter of the color cone increased. The flight pattern of the object was very rapid - horizontal and vertical within a small area with no set pattern. It did not move from the same general area of the sky. After arriving over Fairfield, Utah, I reported the sighting to Salt Lake ARD and did not pursue the object any further, since I was on an IFR clearance.

REPORT FOREMAN AFR 200-2

1. Since it was night flight, no discernible outline of the object could be established. The size would be estimated to be about the size of a baseball. The color changed from brilliant white to a brilliant white periodically. There was only one object. There were no discernible features, exhaust trails or other identifiable features except the changing lights and strange movements.

2. The object was first noted as being a blinking light and identified continuously as being another aircraft. The elevation would be estimated to be approximately 40,000 feet on a heading of 290 degrees from Fairfield, Utah and approximately over Wendover, Utah. The flight pattern was from left to

right, horizontally then vertically with no regular pattern. The speed would be estimated to be very rapid and certainly one which no aircraft to my knowledge could accomplish. The object did not disappear until I penetrated the overcast into Salt Lake City Radio. The object was in my sight for approximately 25 minutes.

3. The manner of observation was air to air. I was flying T-3A, Serial M 53-5097 at 37,000 feet on a heading of 290 degrees at an indicated air speed of 230 M. From station is Hill AFB.

4. The sighting occurred on 16 April 1956 between the hours of 1930 to 2015 MST. The light conditions were excellent for night. I was 1,000 feet on top and the stars and partial moon were very brilliant. It was however night and distances are very hard to accurately establish.

5. The observer was inbound to Fairfield, Utah from Kirtland AFB on a heading of 290 degrees and the object was first sighted out of Fairfield (approximately 120 vertical miles) and was kept in sight until crossing Fairfield and turning to a heading of 343 degrees inbound to Salt Lake City and penetrating a tar-tack.

6. Thomas F. Petit, Captain, USAFRES, 315th Fighter Bomber Squadron (Reserve), Operations Officer, Pilot, 12 years - 235 lbs height.

7. Weather reported by Wendover Air Force Base on a teletype at 1930 Hours, MST: 7,000 broken, 20,000 broken, Wind, Northerly, North Northeast at 10 K. Rain showers, unknown intensity to the West Southwest. 2030 Hours MST: 7,000 broken, 20,000 broken, Visibility 15 M, very light rain showers. Rain showers began at 2020 Hours, wind, West Northwest at 11 K. Winds 6,000 feet, 20 degrees, 10K. Winds 10,000 feet, 350 degrees at 5 K. Winds 16,000 feet, 260 degrees at 15 K. Winds 20,000 feet, 270 degrees at 30 K. Winds 25,000 feet, 270 degrees at 25 K. Winds 45,000 feet, 260 degrees at 15 K.

Observer's account of weather conditions: Visibility militedly solid cloud layer, approximately 30,000, 5,000 feet thick over the area involved. Salt Lake layer broken, Pilot went VFR at approximately 24,000 feet after penetration.

8. None known.

9. None.

10. Unknown; but object could not have been another aircraft.

11. Unknown.

12. Unknown.
