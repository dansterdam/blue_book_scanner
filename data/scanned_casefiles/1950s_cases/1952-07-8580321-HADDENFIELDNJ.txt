The text I can clearly read on this document is:

16 JULY 52 HADDONFIELD NJ

There is a faint stamp/header at the top of the page, but the text is too illegible to confidently transcribe. The rest of the page appears to be blank or too faded to read clearly.


- page 2 -

Here is the text I can discern from the image:

X-H
X-E (not much data, just most likely civilian)
K-&

The number "21" is written in the top right corner of the page.

The number "300108" is written vertically along the right side of the page.

The rest of the page appears to be a grainy, faded document with no other clearly legible text.

At 2215 hours, 16 July 1952, Captain [redacted] acting as Director for McGuire Air Force Base received a telephone call from [redacted], Haddonfield, New Jersey. Mrs. [redacted] reported the sighting of a strange unidentified object in the air by her, her husband and three small children.

The object was sighted by the [redacted] family at approximately 2050 hours as they were returning home from a pleasure drive. It was seen for some fifteen seconds, disappearing from recognition and reappeared and was seen for five to ten seconds before its final disappearance. It appeared to be a perfectly round phenomenon, composed of white light, which had no visible means of propulsion. The object was travelling west to east when suddenly it changed direction and travelled in another direction. The object was not seen again.

The claims made by Mrs. [redacted] were referred to the 4568th Air Base Group for investigation and were investigated by S/Sgt Dennis G. [redacted], Intelligence Operations Technician. His complete report is forwarded.

I just wish to state, that there were no stars nor sun nor moon as it was cloudy, and that it was no definite object soaring through the sky. The amazing thing was, that it did not turn gradually — but made a sharp turn and seemed to disappear. I then it appeared again, then disappeared. I imagine if it was an astronomical feature its would seem to fall, whereas this seemed some through the air like an airplane will.
