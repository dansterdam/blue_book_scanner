The image shows a hemispherical diagram, likely representing the sky, with various directional degrees marked around the perimeter such as 0° (N), 45° (NE), 90° (E), 135° (SE), 180° (S), 225° (SW), 270° (W), and 315° (NW). The zenith (90°) is at the top of the hemisphere. There are also angle measurements from 0° to 90° progressing upwards from the horizon to the zenith, marked at intervals of 30° and 60° along both the vertical and horizontal lines. No photograph is present; the graphic is a line diagram.

The diagram appears to denote the positions or directions in which observations were made or something similar. The ground level is illustrated with a line and some texture representing the horizon.

RAREST INVITATION
YOU MAY RECEIVE
...to see and photograph beautiful, gentle and gorgeous Glen Canyon of the Colorado River.

MAY AND JUNE, 1959
* This opportunity will never come again. Why? Because during the winter of 1958-59 the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will close normal river flow with a cofferdam at Glen Canyon damsite. This will begin the forming of Glen Canyon Lake and back the waters above the mouth of the San Juan River, making a lake more than 50 miles in length. That portion of Glen Canyon will forever be buried beneath water and dead silt.
* Come and see the final 100 miles of Gentle Glen Canyon in 1959. We offer the lowest boat fares in our 21 years of guiding on Western Rivers.
* To all of you who pay your full fare before December 31, 1958, the full fare will be $50.00. The same short-trip fares after January 1 will be $60.00.
* For 20 years we have offered river trips on Western Rivers in U. S., Canada and Alaska- "down north" to the Arctic. Our small craft have traveled to within 1400 miles of the North Pole.
* To all of you who identify within one -half topographic mile, the camera spot of the above photo we will give a $5 credit on any booking fare. For particulars, write or wire:

Here is the extracted text from the document using OCR:

```
Our headquarters are at Monticello, Utah,
the hub of the most scenic area in southeastern
Utah and the Four Corners area.

In connection with these points of interest we
visit many more areas, side wayons and an
cient Indian Ruins as out time and local con-
ditions will permit.

For superb scenery and complete relaxation
plus delicious meals prepared over an open
camp fire and sleeping out in the fresh air
between clean sheets and blankets in warm
sleeping bags with air mattresses, is a thrill
never to be forgotten.

THE NEEDLES was named for the thousand
of red and white sandstone spirals standing
in this canyon country near the junction of the
Green and Colorado Rivers. This area is fa-
mous for its photographic scenery and near by
are hundreds of canyons with cliff dwellings,
pictographs, and the beautiful Angel Arch,
Castle Arch and many other arches.

THE STANDING ROCKS is a wild and remote
country bordering along the North Rim of Cat-
aract Canyon. In places a person can loo!
into the river canyon and see the muddy Colo-
rado 2000 feet below. There are sprials, arches,
unexplored side canyons and many other inter-
esting sights in this wild land of the historic
Robbers Roost country.

SOUTHEASTERN UTAH is the land of blue
sky and white clouds. Often a person can see
the distant mountains 100 or more miles
away.

River Tours

Water stage run-off determines the dates for the Spring, early Summer river runs down 
the San Juan River. These dates, for nine-day trips are set for, Bluff, Utah, to Lees Ferry, 
Arizona:

May 1 to 9   
May 12 to 20 
May 23 to 31 

San Juan .  .  . 

June 3 to 12
June 15 to 23

$125.00 for nine days

Glen Canyon---Hite, Utah, to Lees Ferry, Arizona:

July 3 to 14
July 17 to 28
Aug. 3 to 14
Aug. 17 to 28
Sept. 3 to 14
Sept. 17 to 28

Party of 19 or less . . . $175.00 for 10, 11 or 12 days
Party of 20 or more . . . $150.00 for 10, 11 or 12 days

(The above fares are for Glen Canyon)

The July, August and September dates are for 12-day periods. All these boat runs for 
the Glen Canyon section of the Colorado River start above HITE, Utah, and extend nearly 
170 miles to LEES FERRY, Arizona. In this section there are 22 minor rapids, or big riffles, 
with little or no danger.

For the first night’s stop we plan to take passengers to Capitol Reef Lodge, due to open 
May 1, 1949. It is located in the heart of Capitol Reef National Monument, deep in a val-
ley of colorful Navajo and Wingate sandstone; the Chinle shales; and the Moenkopi Red 
Beds. 

At the mouth of Padre Creek in Utah, we have the Crossing of the Fathers, where on 
Nov. 7, 1776, Padres Dominguez and Escalante and party crossed the Colorado. Even in 
the East, you do not have too many points of older history.

Of course, the 5 1/2 mile hike to RAINBOW BRIDGE one day, and return to the river the 
following day, is the highlight of the Glen Canyon and San Juan River trips. Those who 
do not care to make the 11-mile plus hike will be made comfortable in camp, near fresh 
water swimming pools, or can spend the night at Echo Camp near the Rainbow Bridge.

For nearly all meals for overland travel, preceding the river trip (Glen Canyon), we will 
contract with a chartered bus line, using station wagons and sedans. For river travel we will use the World War II neoprene, 10-man, 8-air chamber rafts. 
Those were the type you saw in motion pictures of our June 1948 San Juan River run, 
at Smithsonian in Sept.

Up to 100 different foods will be carried. Special diets will be cared for if we are no-
tified in advance.

Passengers are to supply their own sleeping bags. We suggest that passengers bring one
pair of high tennis shoes of the “Keds” type, Levis, socks, shirts, one warm jacket, sun 
helmet and light rain coat. Personal baggage will be limited to 25 pounds exclusive of 
bed roll and camera.

There will be eight 10-man passenger boats available, allowing 4 persons and our boat-
man to each boat. Army Air Corps surplus life preservers supplied for all. There will be
waterproof special purpose rubber bags for protection of most valuable personal equipment.

The following may be added to PROPOSED ITINERARY for Glen Canyon trips: Those 
who drive to join river party may leave car, travel clothes, etc., with Mr. and Mrs. Art 
Green at Marble Canyon Lodge, Arizona (Via Cameron). Come to Richfield, Utah, in
outing clothes, via Santa Fe Trailways. Car will be awaiting you at end of river journey.

For the San Juan River run, the meeting place will be Bluff, Utah, or Mexican Hat,
Utah. If desired by car owners, their cars will be driven to Marble Canyon Lodge by de-
pendable desert drivers.

$25 deposit when passage is booked. Balance on day of sailing. Deposit refunded if 
passage is cancelled 30 days before sailing.

Please do not hesitate to ask for additional information.

WHAT CONTACT?

In the swashbuckling days of 1918 
In the days of World War One in France 
When men were “aviators”—always 
“Flew by the seat of their pants”

Two pet words in that day 
were—“CONTACT,” “COUPE.”

The modern fly-boys are more 
business and shekel-minded; 
Their helmeted brow never streamed a mademoiselle’s silk hose!

They concentrate more on E.T.A.
and delicately balanced wind sock;
Prosaically they say,
“Switch On—Switch Off.”

The early birds were pioneers all,
The modern boys, although jet headed,
May yet know, electronic control.

So to you, fast flyers 
and slow boaters;
And intermediate hikers;
To ALL of you dear souls;
Whether we have flown—
High in the air;
Whether we have flown—
Low in the water;
Trudged deep in the desert sands;
My appreciation,
And heartfelt thanks;
For having made CONTACT—
Along life’s way;
I love you,
Beyond the day of COUPE!
