RAREST INVITATION
YOU MAY RECEIVE

To see and photograph beauti, gentle and gorgeous Glen
Canyon of the Colorado River.

MAY AND JUNE, 1959

• This opportunity will never
come again. Why? Because
during the winter of 1963-59
the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
will close normal river flow
with Glen Canyon Dam. This
will be dansite. This will begin
the forming of Glen Canyon
Lake and will back water
above the mouth of the San
Juan River, making a lake more
than 50 miles long. All of Glen
Canyon of Glen Canyon will
forever be buried beneath water
and dead silt.

• Come and see the final 100
miles of Glen Canyon before
in 1959 we offer the lowest
boat fares in our 21 years of
guiding on Western Rivers.

• To all of you who identify
within 1 mile of the above
photo we will give a $5
credit on any boating fare. For
particulars, write or wire.

For superb scenery and complete relaxation camp life and sleeping out in the fresh air between clean sheets and blankets in warm sleeping bags with air mattresses, is a thrill never to be forgotten.

THE NEEDLES was named for the thousands of red and white sandstone spirals standing in this canyon country near the junction of the Green and Colorado Rivers. This area is famous for its photographic scenery and near by photographs of canyons with cliff dwellings, Castle Arch, and the beautiful Angel Arch.

THE STANDING ROCKS is a wild and remote country bordering along the North Rim of Cat Canyon. In places a person can look into the river canyon and see the muddy Colorado 200 feet below. There are spirals, arches, unexplored side canyons and many other interesting sights in this wild land of its historic Robbers Roost country.

San Juan

Glen Canyon—Hite, Utah, to Lees Ferry, Arizona:

July 17 to 28                                Sept. 3 to 14
Aug. 3 to 14                                 Sept. 17 to 28
Party of 19 or less . . . . $175.00 for 10, 11 or 12 days
Party of 20 or more . . . . $150.00 for 10, 11 or 12 days
Plus above dates for Glen Canyon

The July, August and September dates are for 12-day periods. All these boat runs for the Glen Canyon section of the Colorado River start above HITE, Utah, and extend nearly 170 miles to LEES FERRY, Arizona. In this section there are 22 minor rapids, or big riffles, with little or no danger.

For the first night's stop we plan to take passengers to Capitol Reef Lodge, due to open May 1, 1949. It is located in the heart of Capitol Reef National Monument, deep in a valley of colorful Navajo and Wingate sandstone; the Chinle shales; and the Moenkope Red Beds.

At the mouth of Padre Creek in Utah, we have the Crossing of the Fathers, where on Nov. 7, 1776, Padres Dominguez and Escalante and party crossed the Colorado. Even in the East, you do not have too many points of older history.

Of course, the 5½ mile hike to RAINBOW BRIDGE one day, and return to the river the following day, is the highlight of the Glen Canyon and San Juan River trips. Those who do not care to make the 11-mile plus hike will be made comfortable in camp, near fresh water swimming pools, or can spend the night at Echo Camp near the Rainbow Bridge.

For nearly 250 miles overland travel, preceding the river trip (Glen Canyon), we will contract with a chartered bus using station wagons and sedans.

For river travel we will use the World War II neoprene, 10-man, 8-air chamber rafts. Those were the type you saw in motion pictures of our June 1948 San Juan River run, at Smithsonian in Sept.

Up to 100 different foods will be carried. Special diets will be cared for if we are notified in advance.

Passengers are to supply their own sleeping bags. We suggest that passengers bring one pair of high tennis shoes of the "Keds" type, Levis, socks, shirts, one warm jacket, sun helmet and light rain coat. Personal baggage will be limited to 25 pounds exclusive of bed roll and camera.

There will be eight 10-man passenger boats available, allowing 4 persons and our boatman to each boat. Army Air Corps surplus life preservers supplied for all. There will be waterproof special purpose rubber bags for protection of most valuable personal equipment.

The following may be added to PROPOSED ITINERARY for Glen Canyon trips: Those who drive to join river party may leave Car, travel clothes, etc., with Mr. and Mrs. Art Green at Marble Canyon Lodge, Arizona (via Cameron). Come to Richfield, Utah, in early clothes, via San to Trailways. Car will be awaiting you at end of river journey.

For the San Juan River run, the meeting place will be Bluff, Utah, or Mexican Hat, Utah. If desired by car owners, their cars will be driven to Marble Canyon Lodge by dependable desert drivers.

$25 deposit when passage is booked. Balance on day of sailing. Deposit refunded if passage is cancelled 30 days before sailing.

Please do not hesitate to ask for additional information.

CONTACT

Contact men and women has come about through hundred twenty-seven of you may recall the "ER RATS" invitation to see colored motion pictures, given by COLORADO UP RIVER. This invitation was printed in war days, on galley proof.

Approximately 600 of you men and women listed in have, for 15 years, enjoyed "Grand Vacation Deluxe." During the years we have learned "Are the Grandest People on Earth."

From our little "get-out-of-work outing" by 3 GO UP RIVER EXPEDITION; LARABEE STERN RIVER TOURS; and as CANYON originated respectively in the years 1939, 1948 and 1952. We exist, and are constantly searching for ways

To all who know our "quaint fancy," you under-stand the publishing a list of logs; diaries; journals; "cer-tain writings"

To all you appeared to 1954. We

To those you have gallantly crossed. We sail all.

For those "who are indicated with three stars (***)", our battle over The Four Horsemen, and have The River Styx.

WHAT CONTACT?

In the swashbuckling days of 1918
In the days of World War One in France
When men were "aviators"—always
"Flew by the seat of their pants"

Two pet words in that day
were—"CONTACT," "COUPE."

The modern fly-boys are more
business and shekel-minded;
Their helmeted brow never stream-
ered a mademoiselle's silk hose!

They concentrate more on E.T.A.
and delicately balanced wind sock;
Prosaically they say,
"Switch On—Switch Off."

The early birds were pioneers all,
The modern boys, although jet headed,
May yet know, electronic control.

So to you, fast flyers
and slow boaters;
And intermediate hikers;
To ALL of you dear souls;
Whether we have flown—
High in the air,
Whether we have flown—
Low in the waters;
Trudged deep in the desert sands;
My appreciation,
And heartfelt thanks;
For having made CONTACT—
Along life's way;
I love you,
Beyond the day of COUPE!

Photo by Hugh Culler

(As he appeared in 1940)

The image shows a person wearing a wide-brimmed hat, holding something close to their face, possibly a camera or other device. The photograph appears to be a black and white image with a vintage look, consistent with the 1940 time period mentioned in the caption.
