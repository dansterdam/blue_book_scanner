FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

1. This investigation was directed by Headquarters, Air Force Intelligence, USAF, in accordance with AFR 200-2, concerning a flying saucer incident at Wilton, Connecticut, on 23 February 1955.

2. The action was initiated in this case initiated by Special Agent in charge, SAFOI-3.

3. On 1 March 1955, the undersigned contacted a letter from Headquarters USAF, Washington 25, D.C., concerning the sighting of a flying object on 23 February 1955. The 1st ind of 23 February 1955.

"It is not known if an official investigation has been made with respect to the following information, but it not, you can at least pass it on.

I live in Wilton, Connecticut, on a return trip from last Saturday night, February 27, with my wife, I was on Route 33, about 1/2 way between Wilton to my home (which is about 1/4 mile from the center), my wife spotted and pointed to me a rather peculiar flying object across the horizon. It appeared to be a red ball of a solid shape, much like a meteor and traveling at a high pace or speed. It was not an airplane. A local air base was later mentioned as some possible explanation for this.

However, I spoke to a friend of mine, who lives on the main highway, who was able to corroborate, in reply to my description, that the same object was seen by him a similar object and a vehicle passed over his home at approximately the same time. This could have been a meteor or a similar object, but the way, speed and distance were such that it was hard to believe there was a justification for the location of the object. It also was somewhat difficult to explain 1000 ft. or slightly lower in such case."

You may have further comments of this strange object, and it will be glad to have you fill in blanks.

This image appears to be a road map or topographical map with numerous interconnected lines representing roads, highways, and geographical boundaries. The map is in black and white and shows a dense network of roads and pathways covering the entire page. Due to the image quality and resolution, most of the text labels are too small or blurry to be clearly read with certainty. The map seems to cover a region with multiple intersecting routes and appears to be focused on a specific geographic area, likely in Connecticut given the filename, but the exact details are not legible.
