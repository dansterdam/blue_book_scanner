Statement of Observer:

1. The objects that I sighted were round and they appeared to be elliptical. I could not tell the size of these objects, as there was no scale for me to use. They were very high, apparently 8 to 10,000 feet altitude. They left no exhaust or vapor trail nor any sound. They were of a flat white color which did not leave any light or reflection from them. When they first came into view, they were in a (5) loose formation, then well away from each other. The speed was great, the lack of time in which to make observation prevented my accurate estimate. I was only able to keep the objects under observation for about 1 minute before they turned over the base and disappeared, heading north.

2. These objects were sighted at 1050 hours, Pacific Daylight Saving Time. This occurred about one hour after a cloud cover atom that was sighted in the direction of Las Vegas.

3. They were observed on the ground by naked eye.

4. I was in the range tower at the George Air Force Base, south area, 2 blocks east of the base Harry Truman. The objects came from a southwesterly direction. They turned, making a slow arc to the northwest, then went in a northerly direction over the base and disappeared. No reliable estimate of altitude could be made. (See attached sketch.)

5. In civilian life, I worked for Lockheed Aircraft Corporation as a plastic fabricator. I have studied art for 14 years and have done some commercial art work. I did not graduate from high school. I am a retired civil service employee, 4 combat tours in the Korean War, 6 years California National Guard for 3 years as platoon sergeant. I was also a member of the Civil Air Patrol. I have spent a large part of my life learning aircraft. I am well acquainted with aerodynamic theory.

6. There was a clear sky, no clouds, and the temperature was warm.

7. None.

Statement of Observer

I, [redacted], do make the following statement concerning certain unidentified objects observed by me on 11 May 1952:

1. One of the 3 objects that I observed resembled a paper plate in shape and appearance and was of a flat white color. The others were too high to allow accurate estimate as to size, but had a metallic glow. One of the smaller objects was not continually visible because it seemed to waver or "bob". As it turned, its sun's reflection on its hull caused it to glint. The other small object was continually visible and both seemed to be in a wing formation. The object resembling the "paper plate" at flipped end over end in a definite direction, disappeared into "the south" and was gone about 5 minutes later at a reduced speed. 20 to 30 seconds after the second observation had commenced, I saw the "paper plate" object make a 90° turn to the south and approach the two smaller objects, which did not make their appearance until the second observation. These appeared to be no interaction between the "paper plate" object and the two smaller ones. I did not notice any noise or vapor trails emanating from any of the objects.

2. I made the two sightings at 1220 and 1226. The first observation lasted 1 minute and the second one lapsed 1 minute.

3. I observed the objects from the ground with the naked eye.

4. I was at the central part of George Air Force Base when I made the observations. George Air Force Base is located 6 miles northeast of Victorville, California. The larger "paper plate" object moved in a southwest direction when first sighted. When I sighted it for the second time, it was moving south and then headed south after executing a 90° turn to the right. Its altitude was between 10,000 and 15,000 feet. The two smaller objects did not have in any direction but remained in the same general vicinity. They were between 33,000 and 43,000 feet high.

5. I have a high school education and am taking instruction as a civilian light aircraft pilot.

6. Weather was clear, with good visibility and little wind in the vicinity.

7. No special activity or condition which might account for the sighting.

8. No physical evidence of the observation was apparent.

9. No interception or identification action taken.

10. No aircraft in the air in the vicinity at the time of observation.

Memorandum for Record

SUBJECT: Trip to George AFB on 20-23 May 1952

On 17 May 1952, I called Major Vincent Wolrath, Wing Intelligence Officer of the 146th Fighter Bomber Wing at George AFB, Calif. Major Wolrath stated that due to the recent flurry of sightings he deemed it very advisable to send someone from ATIC to George AFB.

On 20 May arriving at George AFB late on the evening of the 20th.

On 21 May 1952 contacted Major Wolrath who reviewed sightings on 17-18-19-20 May. Several of these sightings from a T-6, seemed to be representative and plans were made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 21 May.

[Redacted] who had piloted the T-6, during previous observations was contacted to fly at 2 P.M. and talk along and to assist in setting up an observation team. Both the Ground Control Intercept (Radar) and Fighter Interceptor squadron of ADC were contacted and briefed on the sightings and plans to observe from a T-6. They agreed to stand by all afternoon on "D" channel of VHF in case the object was sighted. If it was, F-86's would be scrambled and radar would attempt a pick-up. A ground station and a ground observer team headed by Major Wolrath was equipped with a ground VHF set and would have telescopes to make ground observations from the George AFB line. Weather was alerted in case a theodolite was needed. All VHF sets were set up for "D" channel on a special frequency to keep the interception of messages to a minimum.

At 1330 PDT, the T-6 was airborne. It had a Leica with a 135 mm telephoto lens in case photos could be taken. At 1430 PDT, the ground observer team called the T-6 and stated they were observing the object through a telescope and it appeared to be a balloon. Also it was identical to several of the previous reports as previous observers were on the ground watching. The aerial search was broken off and the T-6 landed at 1440 PDT. The object disappeared. The aerial search was continued with no success.

[Redacted] contacted Edwards AFB and was informed that at 1438 PDT a Rawinsonde balloon from their station burst at 75,000-80,000' SSE of their station (approximately over George AFB).

It was concluded that the object was this balloon.

On 22 May 1952, the entire day was spent interviewing sources of other sightings. It will be noted that although some of reports were attributed to balloons, others could not be and are still being investigated.

Lt Ruppelt returned to W-P AFB on 23 May.

The cooperation received at George AFB was excellent.

APPENDIX VI

George AFB, Calif. - 1, 9, 13, 14, 20 May 1952

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

The sighting on 1 May 1952 at George AFB, Calif., was the first of a series of nine sightings there in a three week period. These sightings were all by military personnel.

a. 1 May 1952 - Five round, disc-shaped objects, flat white in color which gave no glare or reflection were sighted. They were in formation with three in front and two in the rear. The latter two darted around in a circular zig-zag manner.

b. 9 May 1952, 1020 PDT - An unidentified round, silver object was sighted visually from the ground and from the F-86 aircraft.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDT - Two unidentified objects moving with the current or breeze at a slow speed. They appeared to be a silver metal color with a dark spot in the center and at certain angles to the sun gave off a bright flare.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDT - Object was of dull color like a thundercloud. It was shaped like an arrowhead but had no known aerodynamic features.

e. 11 May 1952, 1220 PDT - Object looked like a white paper plate flipping end over end with an initial speed comparable to a jet although later reduced its pace.

f. 13 May 1952, 1425 PDT - Single object, appeared round, shiny, metallic which glowed or reflected white or silver was observed for thirty minutes.

g. 14 May 1952, 1405 to 1430 PDT - Same description as object sighted on 13 May and by same sources.

h. 20 May 1952, 1425 PDT - A silver colored, bright, round object was observed for five minutes. Initially the object was stationary but eventually moved and faded away.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

Only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately over George AFB, consequently, for the most part they are the only balloons with which we are concerned. These balloons are released irregularly thus accounting for some of the unusual times of sightings reported in cases which are probably balloons.

Memorandum for Record

SUBJECT: Trip to George AFB on 20-23 May 1952

On 17 May 1952, Lt E. J. Ruppelt called Major Vincent Molrath, Wing Intelligence Officer of the 146 Fighter Bomber Wing at George AFB, Calif. Major Molrath stated that due to the recent flurry of sightings he deemed it very advisable to send someone from ATIC to George AFB. Lt Ruppelt had ordered out and deployed by commercial air on 20 May 1952 arriving at George AFB late on the evening of the 20th.

On 21 May 1952, Lt Ruppelt contacted Major Molrath who reviewed sightings on 19, 20, 11, 13, 14, and 20 May. Several of these sightings from a T-6, seemed to be repetitive and plans were made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 21 May.

Lt [name blacked out] who had piloted the T-6, during previous observations was contacted. He offered to fly that P.M. and take Lt Ruppelt along as observer and to assist in setting up an observation team. Both the Ground Control Intercept (Radar) and Fighter Interceptor squadron of ADC were contacted and briefed on the sightings and plans to observe from a T-6. They agreed to stand by all afternoon on "B" channel of VHF in case the object was sighted. If at 1345 PQST, a ground station and a ground observer team headed by Major [name blacked out] was equipped with a ground VHF set and would have a telescope to make ground observations from the George AFB line. Weather was alerted in case a theodolite was needed. All VHF sets were set up for "D" channel on a special frequency to keep the interception of messages to a minimum.

At 1330 PQST, the T-6 was airborne. Lt Ruppelt had a Leica with a 135 mm telephoto lens in case photos could be taken. At 1430 PQST, the ground observation team called the T-6 and stated they observed the object through a telescope and it appeared to be a balloon. Also it was identical to several of the previous reports as previous observers were on the ground watching. The aerial search was broken off and the T-6 landed.

Lt Ruppelt contacted Edwards AFB and was informed that at 1438 PQST a Rawin-sonde balloon from their station burst at 75,000'-80,000' SSE of their station (approximately over George AFB).

It was concluded that the object was this balloon.

On 22 May 1952, the entire day was spent interviewing sources of other sightings. It will be noted that although some of the reports were attributed to balloons, others could not be and are still being investigated.

Lt Ruppelt returned to W-P AFB on 23 May.

The cooperation received at George AFB was excellent.

APPENDIX VI

George AFB, Calif. - 1, 9, 13, 14, 20 May 1952

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

The sighting on 1 May 1952 at George AFB, Calif., was the first of a series of nine sightings there in a three week period. These sightings were all by military personnel.

a. 1 May 1952 - Five round, disc-shaped objects, flat white in color which gave no glare or reflection were sighted. They were in formation with three in front and two in the rear. The latter two darted around in a circular zig-zag manner.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - An unidentified round, silver object was sighted visually from the ground and from two F-86 aircraft.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Two unidentified objects moving with the current or breeze at a slow speed. They appeared to be a silver metal color with dark spot in the center and at certain angles to the sun gave off a bright glare.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - Object was of dull color like a thundercloud. It was shaped like an arrowhead but had no known aerodynamic features.

e. 11 May 1952, 1220 PDST - Object looked like a white paper plate dipping end over end with an initial speed comparable to a jet although later reduced its pace.

f. 13 May 1952, 1425 PDST - Single object, appeared round, shiny, metallic which glowed or reflected white or silver was observed for thirty minutes.

g. 14 May 1952, 1405 to 1430 PDST - Same description as object sighted on 13 May and by same sources.

h. 20 May 1952, 1425 PDST - A silver colored, bright, round object was observed for five minutes. Initially the object was stationary but eventually moved and faded away.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

Only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately over George AFB, consequently, for the most part they are the only balloons with which we are are concerned. These balloons are released irregularly thus accounting for some of the unusual times of sightings reported in cases which are probably balloons.

San Francisco
1 May 1952

Dear Sirs:

I like to tell you about something that happened to me today. It's all about flying saucers. I was on my way home and came with bus up the hill at Turn and Baker St. in S.F. Just when reaching the top of the hill I happened to see a object in the sky. Seemed to be high up at the same time not too far away to the right of the bus. I got the impression it was a saucer might away of drawing you can figure out even though since now and in what angle I saw it. It seemed to be only big as a beam to me that how big I saw it from the bus and was standing still hitting a little. The thing was all black around the borders and a shiny very bright part in the middle should say something like real shiny aluminum. I could not in so short time I had as I was getting off the bus at the top of the hill. It was only have been about 30 seconds it all occur to me. I got off the bus and looked right away for the object but it was absolutely gone. I could not find it any place on the sky. I should say it was just about to take off when I sighted this object as it was still at the moment I saw it was standing still. However, I saw another plane in the sky to the right. It was one of the old school planes with the landing wheels down but it was going from left to right and it could obviously not have been this plane I saw as it was so much nearer and every contour of that plane was not visible. No wings or tail was seen at the object I saw.

I went upstairs as I live only half a block down the street and have a big picture window facing the sky at where I saw the object. I took my binoculars out not very good but helps on near objects. I could not find it on light side of the house in the sky. When I saw the saucer it was just about 3.25 pm "daylight saving time." Next thing I saw made my knees weak I just came in from the other side of the house after looking there for quite a long time. There I put the time at 3.50 p.m. I looked at the clock thats how I know about the time to the minutes. I have followed every article about saucers and rockets and I am very interested in scientific matters. I have been watching the sky every day whenever I got time for it.

Well next thing made me shaky as I said. I am sorry to make it so detailed and so much going around the hole thing.

I came in from the other room and in to our room and started to cook immediately. And here I saw big black bird coming down toward the church as is standing on this hill of Fulton St. toward the beach I think about 5 blocks from here. I did not see from where they came as I saw them just coming from the air pretty low at about 300 feet and going down to about 175 and 200 feet. My first thought was just like this. I go 6 or 7 angles. But when I looked through my glasses they did not look like ordinary birds. Lack this wind was blowing from the ocean beach toward city Center. If you have a way I hardly you can follow it better. These big blurry thing, was flying toward the beach the slowed down to nearly no speed at all at the church. Dark no wing flags was visible whatever. I am often sitting looking


- page 28 -

Here is the full text from the document:

at the birds around here they are neagules, pigeons and small birds and
they always fling the wings that in and around the mouth is with of
the wind on straight wings without flapping. These birds seemed to have
an unknown power pushing them against the wind forward without hardly moving
the wings except of what seemed to be for balance. One of the birds flew
cut from the others and circled around the church once very slow still not
flapping the wings. It lifted one wing up to turn like this

I tried to see if it was bird or what my glasses was not strong enough for
it all I could see was that it had no long neck in such a way as I can not
or much a bird. It did not have a birdlike tail it had as two feet was
put in one leg. The hole thing looked like if it contained a human body
and with wings extending at the waist. To me it seems like if it was some
big kind of a black skin or uniform. My husband tried to make a model of
it after my saying how. But I still should say the body in this model is
not right quite more form of a body could be made like a human being.
The head is just about correct of what I saw. The only one of the birds I
could study was the one which circled around the church top slowly. All of
it I had seen in about 30 minutes time gave me a funny feeling. Afterwards
I watched the other planes in the air. I passed along a couple
of small planes. On the other side of the house I was a jet plane take off
from Alameda but none had the resemblance of the object. I also sat for two
hours watching the other birds in the binoculars when they flew by the church
on all the birds I saw clearly the tail spread apart even though they was
so much smaller than the flying things I saw.

Now I wonder what did I really see? Did I see something nobody else
saw. After it all was over I thought about those big birds and the smaller
and I can hardly believe it. I really watched the flying birds for about
5 minutes. My husband laughed at me when he came home and I told him but as
true as I am writing this it was not an earthly plane I saw and I don't think
the birds was from the earth either. The birds must have been at least 5 not
more than 4 feet long. I compared the length with example after. I have
never seen birds that does not have to flap their wings against wind. I hope
you will believe me as I do not tell lies at least not without having a good
reason and I can very interested in what to in the outer space so I would not
like to tell a false thing about a thing like this. I hope it can be of more
use for the scientists or whoever is in charge of the saucer divisions.

Sincerely
San Francisco

P.S. I do not want my name given out to papers or anything. Please keep it
a secret, I do not like embarrassing questions from people who does not understand or believe that there is something in space called saucers watching us.

It did no flapping of wing

on paper and clock right away.
Looked at birds with weak
binoculars.

They sure looked like it was
small human being inside a
birdskin that was no feathers
on. Take also covered and
black, scarey-looking they
were to me.

This is the nearest I can come

This bird was about the same length
as a penguin. No visible beak, no
tailfeathers and flew against the
wind with no flapping of wings, only
used wing for balance (what it looked
like) and turning. No visible wing
feathers and flew too fast for being

Dear Gentlemen,

This letter was intended for the N.I.C.A.P. which I wrote to last month but I decided against sending it so I have saved it in my personal investigation to you people as they only seem interested in getting their 5 dollars.

It reported seeing a "Flying Saucer" to you people in 1952 or it might have been 1953. Last of May and since that day I have spent all my spare time delving into the "Flying Sauces" matter.

I decided to go to U.S. cite writer and took up astronomy here in their evening school. I was an amateur astronomer before and still am, but I wanted to refresh my knowledge so that I could better start to dig into the matter. Nothing really worked out at first to find out what and

Here is the text from the document:

where these objects come from
Until I come on the other phenomenon
mentioned in the following little. That
completely changed everything.

It is very clear in my mind
by now as I have gotten used to
my belief by now. It has been for under-
stand the things I have mentioned out
pear but it grows on you and the more
I read the scripture the surer I am that
I have come on to the VERY KEY to the
Bible. It is about 4 years now since I
first got unto it, what it is all about
and I have studied a lot of books, taking
one into different subjects concerning the
earth in all fields to try to disprove my
theory but they all point to the fact that
I am right. This is not an easy thing to
admit to and to set the facts behind it all
but it is all there to be had by anyone

who likes to know. It does not dis-
prove of religion but it helps the
religion because when you have want
what I have written (am not big look)

I am sure you will see my points.
I have discussed it with several people
young and old and they believe I am right.

It is just that Scientists and
the men of knowledge is looking for
something that is out of this world
and all the time they are looking in
the wrong direction, it is all for close
to our faces to be seen.

I believe I have broken the case
and here it is. The best you can do
for me now is to study it carefully
with an open mind in return for the
years I have spent at it trying to figure
it all out. Thank you.

of holding at secret. People are
not quite as dense as you think
they are. And in this case I am
afraid it belongs to the people
if you don't let the people know
the truth I can suppose you that I
am writing a book on the subject
and at least some of the people on
Earth will know.

S.F. 17th of Aug. 1960

Sorry it took a long time to make up my mind
about it. I feel it would help a lot if you
could see it is my duty to tell or help at
this writing of Mid Bluff. I just naturally
might make up my mind to tell you. Might also
tell you that I hope Peter may figure it out
words at most from the Bible. I just collected
some and got it wrong. Am all his people and
don't try to give another answer just be-
cause I am know "I am might add" that we

Dear Sir,

Thank you on your prompt answer on my letter of May 29th 1952.

You are most to busy people on you only had time to write 3 lines in the reply to my own letter, and the rest as was of the mail letters.

It really surprised me, believe me.

But as I believe you are looking in the very wrong direction in your answer to the riddle of the flying saucers of think I'll write you another one.

Normally I am away most that is printed now in mass prediction that your letters, but I become so distant that you are not able to set and write such individual in person about the Flying Saucers sight ways that you seem to'll forgive you Reg of me as I do etc.

as I told you before in my earlier note
the personal investigation of some done
finally led me to an analogy the B.H.
of stated with what a fellow work
one day said that "Ezekiel, you was
to know as in the Bible" referring to
an act different matter than the flying
saucers. Well I started thinking
perhaps there is something about the
flying saucers in the Bible here
I did not start to read it anyway
so after a short time I bought the
FATE magazine and in that book there
was a small advertisement that said
"Flying Saucers in the Bible" and I desire
to read and such articles, plus it
mentioned "Ezekiel" and a couple of
other books that I did not remember
now. I did not and after the booklet
in question, but I started to read Ezekiel

Well it has been known now for some time that Dan of Perm University wrote a book and document this, sighting of sky shield as natural phenomenon wing my notice as a lot of mystery of you perhaps my language. He did not think book before he wrote that book. Despite did by skill not he wrote this book, but for him it will excuse his mistake because he had never seen a flying object before except for birds, so it was unbelievable to him that it really was reality to contest he saw. Instead of a "mexican" as the Bible points out. I know for myself when I saw this "flying saucer" in 1952 that it was unreal imaginary maybe that it seemed like it did not quite belong in our atmosphere, yet it was there.

Check: Air Force "Project Bluebook" in Dayton.

Ohio for sighting of may 1st 1952 and set if my report as not that if you like Troubled of what time it fly of can Potential and it was. The gentlemen I received was quite a strong to fill out by the way.

Anyway after I saw this, sitting it seemed I was real thousand men flying if I did set if. It was just that it was something I did was seen before and it did not belong here. Distance may be chief must have felt after he saw these models coming down to earth.

And he even talked to these beings.

If you read it you will find that he is even describing them to have a kind of crystal or (plate if you wish) helmet which had a bandmaster sitting on top of it.

He is also describing some contents the four head, I would like to document

Here is the OCR text from the document:

as being in the middle of: I, the real
face of its being itself being human

as the true animal face was on the
helmet which is described in the text.
Because he does say that their appear-
ance was like that of a man. The old
Pilgrims held forms in their helmets re-
member. The wings could or could not
be sent but 7 of them spent a little
against human nature don't you think,
or were they of the insect life? I doubt
that very much. I doubt if because
I don't think insects would be able
to talk the earthly languages as they
apparently did.

Well this was the point of
reading the Bible which I was not done
since the day I received it at my
confirmation in 1947, and do I wish
I am a fanatic religious person eight

because they don't tell the truth in the
churches any more that is the very state
of facts. None of their goals however be-
came they don't know the truth.

People to me are in a semi sleep and
can't wake up and face the facts which
could help them in very much.

I read the little psychology about
the "Dead Sea Scroll." Here they point
out that the Holy Spirit has to give
because there is no Holy Spirit as yet
believe it. The Noran however point
out that the "Holy Spirit" as Holy Spirit
is the Angel of Revelations the angel Gabriel
ANGEL, i.e. being a messenger from God.

How many times in the Bible are
the angels mentioned, you count them. These
Angels were quite at home here being able
to walk around the Earth as ordinary

tremendous roar like of a waterfall.

Does this sound like ordinary swing to
you gentlemen? Really now, don't think
we are quite that stupid.

The Battle does not stop with flying
saucers sightings with excited.

Remember please this was about 2,000
years ago. How much scientific know-

or easterners had at that time. Even to-
day you will find that the peasant people
of that area are very low in

That all depends on how you look at the

like Enoch when I was a child, then
me would not get very far in the new light-
ing, would me now?

Sometimes someone would have big
to happen in the first place for the Bible
to ever sit main today or not withstand
for 2010 thousand years and more of course.

It was something out of the extraordinary
in that happened at the time and all the
way back to Adam and Eve if you please.

Shows that the people of the time was
so very little up on scientific knowledge
however. And it is a shame that the
Scientists of today is so little interested

Yes you will say because that is the way you
were taught by the clergy in the churches? Well
told them if was here? Nobody is living who
was here to say so. Who then shall we dare
it! The angels and God have superior being.

But the Bible was apparently destroyed
by people here on Earth to hide about the
facts as the angel Gabriel himself says
in the "Koran" because the Koran says
the garden was really up in the heights
i.e. meaning in the Heavens and Adam
and Eve including Cain who slew Abel
was turned down to Earth after their
sins being Adam and Eve had eaten an
apple of the tree of life and Cain of course
had committed murder, an unintentional sin
in the heavens. Now gentlemen what

in the United States 2. Transient flight.

Well it certainly was not just an
ample that carried god to the invisible
claim and can draw to tell as to him
self away that act with he engaged with
in miracles because his people of the time
did not or would not understand the east
fractle if he told them. Which proves that
it certainly was not very bright people
living here at the time of these cities
ogy, which is the first books of the bible
and apparently god told him about the
beginning of his world while they followed
him across the desert for over 40 years.
& Well, who pretend what across the
desert you'll now say if you heard me right
god and angels now.

Now remember that god himself
said that he made the human beings


- page 47 -

Adam and Eve in the likeness of B.H.M.

What does he say about himself? How was he made. He says I am flesh and blood.

So a very simple conclusion tells us he is very much the same as we are.

Yet the works of man tells us a cloud followed them. The 6900 thousand people across the desert for over 40 years. Will lets take a look at it and see what this "cloud" could be. First

Point number 1: The Bible says, if looked like a cloud, at in the daytime.

Of does not say it was a cloud. Further it says: and like fire at night. Does a cloud look like fire at night? Really,

Gentleman. How many source reports have you gotten where people have described them as looking like a burning light, at night-time reports? Think please.

Furthermore there was being in...

this cloud, God himself plus a number
of Angels. Lets take a look at this.
Can anyone of you Gentlemen climb
up on a cloud and stand on it. I don't
think so. Yet this cloud carried
several people made of flesh and blood.
Now really, we all know a cloud
can not carry even a little bit of
this, to fly right through its. How ig-
norant are we going to be to the facts
Gentlemen.

God you show me a cloud that
will stop and go as this one did when
it pleased them for over 40 years, yet
been stood on the ground beside Moses
tent and hovered above the Tabernacle. Gentlemen please, I am not
quite that dumb. And this in the hot
desert even. My goodness if these
clouds that behave that way in the

The people that were in this clear
even went to the length of pointing down
quite a few inches of the miles with
something that sounds like "Flamethower"
or better. Also they apparently opened
up the ground and let a visible section
of Zents fall into it. This was no
small doing exactly that was moving

these people were not satisfied people far
from it. They were even just now
to carry out certain objects, as a friend

1. And there came two angels to Sodom at evening, and Lot sat him in the gate of Sodom; and he seeing, him up in the street and he turned himself with his face toward the ground.

2. And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

(Note:) What Spirit beings would not wash their feet. Figure that one out if you please. And the 3rd verse tells how Lot's family bathed bread and the Angels ate it.

10:15                 10:15
On 19 May 52 at 11:45 hours Pacific Light (ALD5 acft) I observed the
following:

I was a making a flight of two (2) F-86 aircraft on an air defense mission
at George AFB, California. At approximately 11:45 hours while flying in the
G-6 area Air Force Base area we observed, it was a very bright, brilliant
halo-like for local training purposes. While in a rapid rate of turn at altitude
with a 360° turn, I observed an object which appeared to be round, circular
in shape and bright.

The object appears to be some sort brilliant flection from the sun with
at a slight silver color. I stopped my aircraft to investigate and was able
to spin the object in sight. The object was at my 12 o'clock position at
of distance. (approx 15,000 to 17,000) at 15,000 feet there the object was visibly
overhead. The object was no less or more than 15° in size. The object was
all white. However at the time it seemed to me to be at least 20°.
By maneuver set a position to observe, this object in addition to my F-86
was climbing and going ahead. At approximately 12 o'clock time my height
observed the object to hover motionless then accelerate in an instantly direction.
It did not go faster, however it would have also direction. At the start
upon of my observation. During the course of diversion I could turn the
object at the highest possible rate of turn in order to keep it in sight. During
the observation, I could see no trail or exhaust. I was in complete control
of my F-86 limit. The control level began at 15,000 on that day but the top
could not be determined. For my controls were still static. At 16,000 feet
this to object or altitude worked to the point of 16,000 feet. I could see no
motional use in the immediate area. Mentioned previously for a period of 5 minutes
than 1/2 total ground track. I made no evasive action. After making
to low I observed the object in one of the turns appear to have a wing, but
verified distance separation made accurate identification of exact shape impossible.

The weather at the time of the incident was clear with visibility of 20 miles.

The object seen appeared to be clear but I cannot give an azimuth or the object's distance. Although I tried, the object could not be seen from the ground. No vigor trail or jet smoke could be seen from the ground. I could observe it through binoculars. The object was white in color. It appeared to be at high altitudes and moving at high speeds. The cumulus clouds were at about 1000 ft. and ascending slightly. I lost sight of the object as it moved in a smooth, fast manner by the sun's glare.

The object was sighted about 1735M and was observed for about 15 minutes.

I observed the object with a pair of binoculars from the control tower. The object was visible with the naked eye, appearing clearly for the most part.

Location 36.06N 117.03W

The object at first seen 9-10 miles NE of the base, then at approximately 70,000 ft. It later began to take up an easterly course.

Observed from the control tower by operators on duty.

No action taken other than observation.

Statement of Observer

I do make the following statement concerning a certain unidentified object observed by me on 9 May 1952:

1. The object that I sighted was too high to make any determination of size or shape possible. Its color was that of a military aircraft (metallic). It was motionless, and I saw no vapor trail in view. As far as appearance is concerned, my impression of the object was as it would be if I were looking at a single star after sunset.

2. The time of observation was 1250 hours on the date given. Length of observation was approximately 20 seconds.

3. I observed the object with the naked eye from the ground.

4. I was located on the eastern side of George Air Force Base at the time that I observed the object. The object was located vertically above me at an altitude of 30,000 to 40,000 feet and was moving in no direction.

5. I am a civilian light aircraft pilot and have a high school education.

6. Visibility was excellent, with clear skies and slight winds prevailing.

7. No activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

8. No physical evidence, such as fragments or photographs, of the sighting.

9. No interception or identification action taken.

10. One aircraft, a T-6, was flying in the vicinity of the sighting at the time of observation.

Statement of Observer

To make the following statement concerning a certain unidentified object observed by me on
9 May 1952:

1. The single object that I observed appeared to be of a full color, like that of a summer cloud. It seemed to be shaped like an arrowhead, its size was difficult to determine because of the height altitude. There were no vertical features. If it was the approximate size of any known aircraft, it would have to have been about 30,000 to 40,000 feet high. I heard no sound from the object. The object flew straight and level and disappeared over the horizon to the south.

2. I saw the object at 1750 hours on the date indicated. It was in sight for about 30 seconds.

3. Observation was made by naked eye from the ground.

4. I was on the east side of George Air Force Base when I sighted the object. It was vertically overhead and proceeded south at 30,000 to 40,000 altitude.

5. I have a high school education and am taking instruction in civilian flying.

6. Visibility was good, skies were clear and there was little wind in the area.

7. There were no special conditions, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

8. There was no physical evidence, fragments, photographs, etc., of the sighting.

9. No identification or interception measures were taken.

Memorandum for Record

SUBJECT: Trip to George AFB on 20-23 May 1952

On 17 May 1952, Lt E. J. Ruppelt called Major Vincent Wolrath, Wing Intelligence Officer of the 146th Fighter Bomber Wing at George AFB, Calif. Major Wolrath stated that due to the recent flurry of sightings he deemed it very advisable to send someone from ATIC to George AFB. Lt Ruppelt had orders and departed by commercial air on 20 May 1952 late on the evening of the 20th.

On 21 May 1952, Lt Ruppelt contacted Major Wolrath who reviewed sightings on (illegible) 17-19 May. Several of these sightings from a T-6, seemed to be repetitive and plans were made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 21 May.

Lt Meiser, who had piloted the T-6, during previous observations was contacted. He offered to fly that P.M. and take Lt Ruppelt along as observer and assist in setting up an observation team. Both the Ground Control Intercept (Radar) and Fighter Interceptor squadron of ADC were contacted and briefed on the sightings and plans to observe from a T-6. They agreed to stand by all afternoon on "D" channel of VHF in case the object was sighted. Lt x was, F-86's would be scrambled and radar would attempt a pick-up. A ground station and a ground observer team headed by Major Wolrath was equipped with a ground VHF set and would have telescopes to make ground observations. From the George AFB line. Weather was alerted in case a theodolite was needed. All VHF sets were set up for "D" channel on a special frequency to keep the interception of messages to a minimum.

At 1330 PDT, the T-6 was airborne. Lt Ruppelt had a Leica with a 135 mm telephoto lens in case photos could be taken. At 1430 PDT, the ground observer team called the T-6 and stated they were observing the object through a telescope and it appeared to be a balloon. Also it was identical to several of the previous reports as previous observers were on the ground watching. The aerial search was broken off and the T-6 landed.

Lt Ruppelt contacted Edwards AFB and was informed that at 1438 PDT a Rawinsonde balloon from their station burst at 75,000'-80,000' SSE of their station (approximately over George AFB).

It was concluded that the object was this balloon.

On 22 May 1952, the entire day was spent interviewing sources of other sightings. It will be noted that although some of reports were attributed to balloons, others could not be and are still being investigated.

Lt Ruppelt returned to W-P AFB on 23 May.

The cooperation received at George AFB was excellent.

APPENDIX VI

George AFB, Calif. - 1, 9, 13, 14, 20 May 1952

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

The sighting on 1 May 1952 at George AFB, Calif., was the first of a series of nine sightings there in a three week period. These sightings were all by military personnel.

a. 1 May 1952 - Five round, disc-shaped objects, flat white in color which gave no glare or reflection were sighted. They were in formation with three in front and two in the rear. The latter two darted around in a circular zig-zag manner.

b. 9 May 1952, 1020 PDT - An unidentified round, silver object was sighted visually from the ground and from two F-86 aircraft.

c. 9 May 1952, 1220 PDT - Two unidentified objects moving with the current or breeze at a slow speed. They appeared to be a silver metal color with dark spot in the center and at certain angles to the sun gave off a bright glare.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDT - Object was of dull color like a thundercloud. It was shaped like an arrowhead but had no known aerodynamic features.

e. 11 May 1952, 1220 PDT - Object looked like a white paper plate tipping end over end with an initial speed comparable to a jet although later reduced its pace.

f. 13 May 1952, 1425 PDT - Single object, appeared round, shiny, metallic which glowed or reflected white or silver was observed for thirty minutes.

g. 14 May 1952, 1405 to 1430 PDT - Same description as object sighted on 13 May and by same sources.

h. 20 May 1952, 1425 PDT - A silver colored, bright, round object was observed for five minutes. Initially the object was stationary but eventually moved and faded away.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

Only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately over George AFB, consequently, for the most part they are the only balloons with which we are concerned. These balloons are released irregularly thus accounting for some of the unusual times of sightings reported in cases which are probably balloons.

The project monitor of Blue Book went to George AFB to investigate the various reports.

a. 1 May 1952 - Report well documented. No additional information obtained.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PST - A balloon was released from Edwards AFB, 55 minutes prior to this sighting.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PST - No known activity which could account for sighting.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PST - No known activity which could account for sighting.

e. 11 May 1952 - Third report in three days from same individual. No activity in area.

f. 13 May 1952 - Balloon launched from Edwards AFB at 1340 PST.

g. 14 May 1952 - No balloon release officially reported.

h. 20 May 1952 - Balloon released from Edwards AFB at 1332 PST.

III. CONCLUSIONS

a. 1 May 1952 - No Conclusions.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PST - Very probable that the balloon released from Edwards AFB was the object sighted.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PST - Very possible that paper was caught in the thermals and swept along. A similar sighting turned out to be just that.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PST - No conclusions.

e. 11 May 1952 - No conclusions.

f. 13 May 1952 - Probably was balloon released from Edwards AFB, 45 minutes previous.

g. 14 May 1952 - Description fits incident of 13 May so perfectly it is highly probable that the object was a balloon.

h. 20 May 1952 - Balloon released 53 minutes prior to sighting was probably object observed.

They were of a flat, white color and gave off no glare or reflection. They were in formation (an arc or crescent), with the last two drifting around in a circular motion. I noticed a vapor trail of a similar nature.

2. I first saw the objects at approximately 2000 by an ant they were in my sight for some 20 seconds.

3. I observed the objects from a 20 foot control tower on the small arms range. The control tower was on the east side of George Air Force Base, California. It was a visual observation and I estimated the altitude of the objects at approximately 4,000 feet. Some 10 miles away, also that of ordinary jet aircraft.

4. From the observations I made at the time, I would say that they came from the southwest over Apple Valley, California. The formation had a northwest direction toward George Air Force Base, then veered clearly to the east.

5. I am 22 years of age, married and have a high school education. I have spent close to 2 years in the Army and Air Force. I worked in the tower at Victorville, California, as a small arms range tower operator since November 1950.

6. The weather was warm, the sky was clear, and there was little or no wind.

7. I think that weather conditions (no overcast) made this sighting of these objects possible.

8. None.

9. There was no interception or identification.

STATEMENT OF OBSERVER

I, [redacted], Jr., Major, USAF, [redacted] make the following statement concerning certain unidentified objects observed by me on 9 May 1952:

1. The two (2) objects that I observed were of a silvery, metal color with a dark spot at the center, and, at certain angles to the sun, they gave off a bright glare. They were, in my estimation, much as a kite in the air. They were moving with the air current or breeze at a speed described as "slow". No type of movement might be characterized as erratic. No vapor trails or noises were noticed by me.

2. The objects were observed by me at 1250 hours on the date given. I kept them in my sight for 4 minutes.

3. I sighted these objects from the surface with the naked eye.

4. At the time that I first observed these objects I was standing next to my own residence, which is located at Wherry Housing, just south of George Air Force Base. I continued observation of them as I drove north toward the base in my automobile. The objects were from 4,000 to 5,000 feet high. They appeared to be at a distance of about 2 miles. They were located west of me and appeared to be drifting in a north-westerly direction.

5. I am the Intelligence Officer of the 146th Fighter-Bomber Wing.

6. At the time that I saw the objects, the weather was calm, clear and hot, with good visibility prevailing.

7. There was no activity, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

8. There was no physical evidence of the sighting.

9. There was no interception or identification action taken.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. One classification paragraph. Ifg indicates in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part II)

1. Reference letter AFCIG-C/06-2, Subject: "(UNCLASSIFIED) Reporting of Information on Unidentified Flying Objects," dated 19 December 1951, Headquarters, United States Air Force, Washington, D.C.

a. The following information is submitted:

(1) Total of 3 objects were observed. One resembled a paper plate in shape and appearance and was of white color. Glare was too high for accurate estimate of shape or size and metallic glow. One of these two was not continually visible because it seemed to move or "bob". As it turned, the sun's reflection on it was evident. The other of the two small objects was continuously visible. Both of them seemed to be in similar formation. The largest appeared to be like object "flipped end over" and danced, changing direction, diving into south with speed of jet fighter and resuming about 5 minutes later at a reduced speed. "Paper-plate" object was 900 feet to south. About 20 or 30 seconds after, two smaller objects, which did not appear until second observation, appeared between "paper-plate" object and two smaller ones. No noise or vapor trail apparent.

(2) Sightings made at 1920 and 1220 respectively 11 May. Both observations lasted about 1 minute.

(3) Observation took place on ground virtually.

(4) Observer was on central part of George Air Force Base at time of sighting (located about 6 miles northwest of Victorville, California). Larger object, when first sighted, was moving east toward observer, then head-on south after 900 turn to right. All-view was east on 15,700 feet. Two smaller objects also in vicinity but remained in vicinity. Altitude was between 4,500 and 4,250 feet.

(5) Observer has high school education, background and is taking instruction as civilian light aircraft pilot.

(6) Clear sky, visibility 30 miles, temperature 850, wind west at 5 knot per hour.

Statement of Observer

I, [redacted], do make the following statement concerning certain unidentified objects observed by me on 11 May 1952:

1. One of the 3 objects that I observed resembled a paper plate in shape and appearance and was of a flat white color. The others were too high to allow any accurate estimate as to shape or size but had a metallic glow. One of the smaller objects was not continually visible because it seemed to waver or "bob." As it turned, the sun's reflection on it would cause it to glint. The other small object was continually in the south formation. The object resembling the "paper plate" flipped end over end in a definite direction, disappearing into the south with a speed of a jet fighter and returning about 5 minutes later at a reduced speed. 20 to 30 seconds after the observation had commenced, I saw the "paper plate" object make a 90° turn to the south and then it seemed to approach the two smaller objects, which did not make their appearance until the second observation. There appeared to be no interaction between the "paper plate" object and the two smaller ones. I did not notice any noise or vapor trails emanating from any of the objects.

2. I made the two sightings at 1223 and 1226. The first observation lasted 1 minute and the second one lasted 1 minute.

3. I observed the objects from the ground with the naked eye.

4. I was at the central part of George Air Force Base when I made the observations. George Air Force Base is located 6 miles northwest of Victorville, California. The larger "paper plate" object moved in a southwesterly direction when I first sighted. When I sighted it for the second time, it was moving east approaching me and then headed south after executing a 90° turn to the right. Its altitude was between 10,000 and 15,000 feet. The two smaller objects did not move in any direction but remained in the same general vicinity. They were between 30,000 and 40,000 feet high.

5. I have a high school education and am taking instruction as a civilian light aircraft pilot.

6. Weather was clear, with good visibility and little wind in the vicinity.

7. No special activity or condition which might account for the sighting.

8. No physical evidence of the observation was apparent.

9. No interception or identification action taken.

10. No aircraft in the air in the vicinity at the time of observation.

STATEMENT OF OBSERVER

I, [redacted], 146th Medical Group, this date make the following statement concerning my observations on 1 May 1952:

1. The shape of two objects appeared to me to be round, like that of balloons or spheres. The diameter approximated five (5) in length of a G-47. They were five (5) in number, three or them were flying forward and two behind. The color of the objects was silver or white. They were perfectly round in appearance and had no vapor trail or exhaust of any kind. I saw nothing on the objects that looked like motors and I heard no sounds coming from the objects. The two objects at the rear of the formation were moving in a zigzag manner. They appeared to be moving faster than a jet aircraft and disappeared at as great a pace as they appeared.

2. I sighted the objects at approximately 1045 hours and I saw them for from 5 to 10 seconds.

3. I spotted the objects from a tower which is about twenty (20) feet high. I was unable to take a close scrutiny of the objects with binoculars because by the time they had already disappeared from view.

4. I sighted the objects from the tower of the small area rising range of George Air Force Base. They flew over the base in a northeasterly direction at an altitude estimated to be between 10 thousand and 20 thousand feet.

5. I am nineteen (19) years old, am an ambulance driver at George Air Force Base. In civilian life I worked as a mechanic's helper. I completed the 10th grade at school and am married.

6. At the time that I sighted the objects the sky was clear and there was practically no wind.

Statement of Observer

I, A/1C [redacted], HQ & Hq, 146th Air Base Group Base Flight, George AFB, California, do this date make the following statement concerning my observation on 13 May 1952 of an unidentified flying object:

1. The object was round and small and appeared to be very far away. The color was whitish but not bright like a reflection of the sun. There was only one and there was no trail as it seemed to stand still in the air. At one time the object seemed to turn on its side and become thinner. For about 30 seconds. I was looking at the object and it was almost directly overhead when it disappeared very fast.—Almost like a light being turned off. It must have gone straight up.

2. Time sighted 1425 to 1455 13 May 52.
   Time observed - 30 minutes.

3. Visual observation from the air. Speed 150 mph. Altitude 10,500. Type of aircraft - F-46.

4. I was sitting in the rear seat of the aircraft north of George AFB about 10 or 15 miles. The object was almost above us, a little north of us. The aircraft I was in flew east to west and west to east, back and forth. The distance of the object was at least 30,000 feet above us. It appeared to be above a 2-47 in the area and that aircraft had vapor trails from it.

5. I am 22 years old and have completed two years of college. I worked for 13 months at Hughes Aircraft, Culver City, California, the latter six months in the flight test department as a field attendant. I have completed a six month aircraft and engine mechanic's course at Sheppard Field, Texas, in April of this year. I have flown in aircraft since I was 18 years old and never witnessed anything similar.

6. The weather was very clear - no clouds and a slight haze below us.

7. The object might have been from Muroc Air Force Base.

8. None.

9. We went as high as we could in our aircraft.

14 May 1952

UNCLASSIFIED

1, 1st Lt. [redacted], 946th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, to this date make the following statement concerning my observation on 14 May 1952 of an unidentified object:

1. The single object I observed was round, but I was unable to determine whether it was flat or ball-like in volume. I was also unable to make any judgment as to its distance. The object was a metallic surface that appeared to reflect light. It was silver in color. I observed no aerodynamic features on the object, nor did I see any vapor trail or exhaust. The object disappeared as my observer and I looked away during this time.

2. I observed the object from 14:25 to 14:30 hrs.

3. Observation was made in the F-86, flying in a T-66 aircraft at 150 miles per hour, at an altitude of 10,000 feet LAL. A track of 250 degrees was maintained. Location of observation was over the vibration of the aircraft reported several hours later in this area.

4. At the time of observation I was on a flight between a point just west of the Mojave River and a point just south of Edwards Air Force Base. (See attached diagram.) Altitude of the object was estimated to have been for above 40,000 feet. Location of the object was 20 miles east of Edwards Air Force Base.

5. I am 25 years old; commissioned for 7 years. I have had two years of college. I am a Korean returnee who have served as Flight Safety and Accident Investigation Officer with the 946th Fighter-Bomber Wing.

6. Ceiling and visibility was unlimited to the north. There were some high thin ice clouds. In the area, strong ground winds were present but were not quite above 7500 feet.

7. No activity, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the condition, inquiry, or sighting was to lead or relate release in the area brought a negative answer.

8. No physical evidence such as fragments. However, several photographs were taken of the object by a small box camera.

9. I asked Edwards AFB control if any aircraft were in the air that could be dispatched to investigate. They advised me to contact 21st Air Control Squadron, ADC. They replied, however, Clear Tower (tower) stated that an F-86 was being sent. Two (2) jets and one (1) F-84 were observed tracking, at approximately 40,000 feet on east to west heading for the next 3/4 hours.

Statement of Observation

I, [redacted], Headquarters Squadron, 146th Air Base Group, do this date make the following statement concerning a certain unidentified object observed by me on 20 May 1952:

1. The object that I sighted appeared to be oval in shape when viewed from an elevated position; otherwise, round. The color was a bright white, with a blush near the edges. To exhaust, or near well was apparent to me. It hovered in one spot and then, as it slowly traveled off or turned, it displayed a reddish brown color (which lay have been the color of the object and not of the propellant). It disappeared slowly.

2. I sighted the object at approximately 1425 1952.

3. I sighted the object virtually from the ground. The height of the object was very great. It appeared to be only 11 times larger than a pin point. No optical aids were used in the sighting.

4. I sighted the object while on the flight line at George Air Force Base, California. The object was northwest of us at approximately a 1 o'clock position.

5. --

6. Weather was clear with high ground winds.

7. None.

8. None.

9. Report of observation was made immediately.

3. Visually from ground.

4. The object appeared from north of the flight line, George Air Force Base, at a 1 o'clock position above the vapor trail of a B-47 which had recently been in the vicinity. I was standing on the flight line at the time.

5. --

6. Weather conditions were as follows: Clear weather with clouds at high altitudes.
