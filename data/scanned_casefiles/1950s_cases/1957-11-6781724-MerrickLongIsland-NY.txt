WOMAN SAID SHE THOUGH IT WAS THE LIGHTS, I E PAD SOCKET
NOWHERE, NO BULBS WERE BURNED OUT & LIGHTS STAYED ON.
WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NOT BEEN DRINKING, NOR A "QUACK"AND
THAT A NEIGHBOR WAS WITH HER AT THE TIME. NO WINDOWS WERE
BROKEN, THERFORE, MUST HAVE BEEN A FLASH OF LIGHT.
COMMENT: IT BEING A HEAVILY DUSKY DAY, OSCURATION COULD
POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN FROM PHOTO FLASH LAMP IN NEIGHBORING
HOUSE OR OUTDOORS

a flash lamp will [illegible] look
very bright on a heavily dusky
day as reported.

It is amazing how a person
can get scared more in black of
light. It cannot be imagined
only the woman reported it
to the air force.
