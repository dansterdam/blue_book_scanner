10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One circular object, orange, noticed by control tower operators because it was an unfamiliar object. Control tower called at F-89D in area who made a lockon by radar for approximately two minutes with aircraft indicating an overtake speed of fifty knots. Target then began to climb, and lockon was broken.

11. COMMENTS
Object characteristic of balloon description and motion as well as duration consistent with this analysis. A/c radar lockon with climb of object also indicates balloon with radar reflector. Balloons frequently not sighted by pilots.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE has worked in the GCA and Control Tower field
for over three years. Was emphatic in stating that object could not have been
a star, and seemed positive of all times and descriptions. SOURCE is due for
discharge from service in one month.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "I was on standby duty in GCA
on the night of 11 January 1956 when Sgt Compean called my attention to an
object hovering off the approach end of runway 06 at approximately 1840 EST
(ME3408). As he told me to keep an eye on it he called Paperdoll (754th
AC&W Sq) at Alpena, Michigan). I picked up the binoculars and continued to
watch the object. In appearance it was a reddish-orange ball similar to a jet
aircraft flying at approximately 1000 feet. The object was perfectly round; I
believe it was higher than it was wide. It was approximately the size of a
nickel held at arm's length away. There was no apparent motion although it
did glow in an 11 to 12 o'clock position. The object was near Paperdoll
Tip-Toe-Tay (Wurtsmith Base) F-89, aircraft #465) down for a look. Tip-
Toe-Tay came on the runway radar and we told him the object was below him
and to his left. He then reported a temporary radar lock-on. A few moments
later he reported he had lost the target and would come in to land. He touched
down at 1910 EST (ME3410). We later called the pilot in the alert hanger; he
reported he had not seen anything. The object was between 6500 and 11 miles
out. The object suddenly climbed in a 40° angle to his position and the object
was gone. Observer lacks 11. I would estimate the object's altitude to be
between 6500 and 7000 feet. At one time I had both Tip-Toe-Tay and the object
in sight, so I know could not have been confused with a nearby star at the time and it seemed much duller than the star. The
object looked more like a dim fire and when it began climbing I knew it was
going too fast to be a star."

II. RELIABILITY:  SOURCE seemed quite sure of himself in his ability
as a Radar Observer.  He stated that before this incident occurred he always
believed that UFOB were only called in by Pranksters.  SOURCE is married
and plans to make the Air Force his career.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF RADAR CONTACT:  "Upon returning from a
searchie we were told by Reardell that the burstein tower had an unidentified
object in sight.  We confirmed the tower and they told us the object was
heading approximately 240° degrees.  We rolled out on a heading of 230° degrees
at the same time.  We were told the object was in sight and the object was to
left and slightly lower.  We leveled off at 7000 feet and I obtained a contact
3° ahead and slightly left.  I lost contact and a look-on was obtained and
we had approximately a 50 knot over-take speed, the was approximately 1850
MSL (indicated).  We were unable to maintain contact to
gain altitude as indicated by the elevation dot on the radar scope indicator.
He started a climb at 450 knots IAS but were unable to keep the target within
the external limits of the radar.  The target was climbing much faster than
we were.  The automatic gain control cut out at this time which led me to
believe that I no longer had a lock-on.  I immediately went to hand control
but could not make contact.  We then returned to the field and landed at
approximately 1910 EST (120n/c)."

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE didn't seem too certain of himself. Tried to
make his statements coincide with those of Sgt. Porter.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "On the evening of 11 January
1956, at 1840 EST, the personnel in the Control Tower, S/Sgt Porter, S/Sgt
Compean and myself spotted an object off the approach end of runway 06 at
about 7000 feet. The object looked like an aircraft that had just departed
and we were looking at it from the rear. We observed it through the binoculars
and it didn't seem to move. We called Pardnoll to see if they had an aircraft
under their control and they stated that Tip-Toe-Easy was returning from a
B-47 intercept. A few minutes later Tip-Toe-Easy called us and asked if we
still had the object in sight. We said we did. Then had the object and
aircraft in sight and told Tip-Toe-Easy the position of the object from his
present position. He then began approaching the object. He said he had a
temporary lock. We had no visual contact. He stated its position as 11
miles ahead but then said he had lost the object due to its rapid climb. I
saw the object spin slightly, rapidly, and then disappear. We later talked to
the pilot and he stated no other facts. We had lost sight of the object
approximately the same time Tip-Toe-Easy lost radar contact and didn't observe
it after that."

Flt 3-G, 46024 AISS

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with the Wurtsmith Weather Station revealed no significant meteorological data which could be related to the UFOB sighting.

2. Lt Pinasso contacted the 754th AC&W Squadron at Port Austin, Michigan who investigated the possibility of other aircraft being in the area during the UFOB sighting. No aircraft were known to be in the area.

3. Contact was later made with Dr. Everett R. Phelps, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Wayne University in Detroit, Michigan. Dr. Phelps stated that he was at the Planet Venus at the brighter stage during the time of the UFOB observations. He also stated that the position of Venus during the UFOB sighting was 300 degrees above the horizon in the southwestern portion of the sky.

4. The pilot of the F-89 aircraft, 1/Lt Culpepper, could not be contacted during the course of the investigation due to his participation in a cross country flight. S/Sgt. Goepan was on pass and could not be reached either.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that although the planet Venus was located in the same area of sky as the UFOB on the night of the observation, there can be no correlation between the two because of the following reasons:

    a. Sgt. Porter compared the UFOB to a nearby star (which could have been Venus) and stated that the UFOB was not a bright as the star.

    b. Sgt. Porter also stated the color as being reddish-orange; the colors normally associated with stars are white, blue and yellow.

    c. A radar-equipped F-89 aircraft cannot make radar contact with Venus or any other celestial body when flying straight and level at 7000 feet.

    d. The UFOB made a steep angle climb which was observed both visually from the tower and with the F-89 radar indicator.

PAUL J. FINAZZO
1/Lt., USAF
Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. A comprehensive analysis of weather conditions existing in the Wurtsmith AFB area at the time of the sighting revealed the presence of a strong, moving tropopause (temperature inversion), the top of which was at an altitude of 5,500 feet. The above mentioned meteorological phenomena created a bending of radar waves (anomalous propagation) toward the earth's surface and thus a ground target can appear to be in the air. A radar lock-on can be made on a ground target in this situation.

2. Astronomical bodies viewed from the ground through this temperature inversion would appear to be distorted and could appear to move, bounce, and/or take on various colors of the spectrum.

3. After consideration of the statements of the SOURCES, the location of the planet Venus and the evidence of a pronounced inversion, it is the opinion of this headquarters that the sighting was probably caused by an electronic and optical reflection due to meteorological conditions.
