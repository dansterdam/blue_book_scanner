There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document that contains a questionnaire with various questions about a UFO sighting.

Text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound No sound
b. Color Silver, metallic; gray, shiny with dark spots on it.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or a pencil in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a questionnaire form from Project Blue Book, which was the official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text from the document is as follows:

20. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object?
(Circle One) Yes No
IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate? 7 to 10 times the speed of a jet

21. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
(Circle One) Yes No
IF you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was? Impossible to estimate

22. Where were you located when you saw the object?
(Circle One):
a. Inside a building
b. In a car
c. Outdoors
d. In an airplane (type)
e. At sea
f. Other

23. Were you (Circle One):
a. In the business section of a city? 
b. In the residential section of a city?
c. In open country side?
d. Near an airfield?
e. Flying over a city?
f. Flying over open country?
g. Other

24. IF you were MOVING IN AN AUTOMOBILE or other vehicle at the time, then complete the following questions:
24.1 What direction were you moving? (Circle One)
a. North b. Northeast c. East d. Southeast e. South f. Southwest g. West h. Northwest

d. Window glass Yes (No) h. Other

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a complete object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you said you saw. The more details, the better. Well there was just what it looked like a small circular object in the sky with a hazy grayish appearance that seemed to blend in with the overcast sky. it was moving in a straight line at a steady pace at a tremendous speed and it suddenly stopped for a second and then shot off in a different direction at an extremely fast rate of speed that the human eye could not possibly follow.

The image does not contain any photographs, only sketches and text. The first sketch shows an illustration of how high the object was above the horizon, and the second sketch is a compass rose.

In the text, it states:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 / 11 / 55
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. The object was bigger than my car, it was silvery and round. It seemed to be hovering fairly low. I called my wife to come out and see it as it was certainly an unidentified flying object. We watched it for around three minutes till it went behind some trees. I would like to know what it was. I only wish I could have got a better look at it. It seemed very solid and quite unlike anything I have seen before. I have not spotted any such object since and I am quite certain that what I saw was not of any conventional nature.

1. Reference the attached letter from Steff Millard requesting information on unidentified flying objects. The following information is provided to assist you in answering his letter:

2. There have been no reports of Venusian's living in the Pentagon nor reports of flying saucers on the surface of the moon. We do not deny the possibility that there may be life on other planets. We simply state that to date the Air Force has no evidence to substantiate this fact and we have no evidence of intelligent beings from other planets visiting our atmosphere in space ships.

3. The summary of the Washington D.C. sighting of 1952 and the summary of the Mantell case should answer the remainder of Mr. Millard's questions.

4. We are attaching an FTD Form 164 for his use.

The image does not contain any photographs. However, it does contain text that appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads as follows:

July 24, 1954

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in reply to your recent letter in further reference to unidentified flying objects.

While the Air Force does not deny that there may be sightings of other flying objects, there has never been a shred of evidence that would lead anyone to believe that these beings have visited the earth in spaceships. On the contrary, all the investigations made during the past 15 years have served only to strengthen the conviction that no identifiable "flying objects" under discussion are actually craft of some conventional object such as an aircraft, balloon or something even their.

In the case of Captain Mantell, at the time he was dispatched to investigate a UFO, it was not known that a weather balloon was in the area. When the report of his sighting was checked out, investigation revealed that the Navy had released such a balloon under a then classified project and the sighting was determined to be of that balloon. Publicity to those persons actually working on the project.

The Air Force conclusion of the Washington D.C. sightings were that they were due to mirage effects created by a double inversion.

Sincerely, 
MASTON M. JACKS

Dear Saulomann

Could you please send me a copy of section 200 - 256 of the regulations.
Could you also send me a copy of the instructions for filling out U.F.O. reports. I am trying to help the U.S.A.F. and I have met one U.F.O. sighting that I want to report.

I thank you.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,
I would like to relate some details regarding a sighting of "a blue object" witnessed by residents of Woodside, California. The report indicates that on March 25, 1959, around 8:15 PM, several people observed a blue object in the sky. This object was round in shape and was not merely a reflection or a meteor. The object hovered and maneuvered for several minutes before departing rapidly. The report notes that there is no evidence that this was a known aircraft, and it was not identified as a conventional UFO. The report suggests further investigation may be warranted, as the witnesses were considered reliable. The letter concludes by stating that while Project Blue Book has no further information on this specific sighting, there is evidence that similar objects have been observed in the area.

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a handwritten document that appears to be a report or notes related to a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Wake 3 knew 1 sited UFO maneuvered around while lighted up. Was in army on Okinawa & believe around 1952 Sept, Nighttime
Little while man saw 1 UFO, circling area at high altitude, Bright lights, Stood still & then shot away very fast. Same time, another GI saw one
& reported to CO, so both saw same thing. I do not know what make, model or size of UFO, but it was lighted up, maneuvered around & then
left very fast. I have seen a couple of other UFO sightings also, but not so clear. Last night in our area 2 sighted UFO trailed by SAC jet
approx 830 PM 9/6 Unidentified object very bright. Moved to West. Watched several minutes & then object made a quick acceleration & was gone
Total time seen approx 5 minutes.
One thing was noticed on many occasions, we could not see very clearly of the UFOs, seem to have haze around them. Do not know why. This
could mean they are operating some kind of shield or magnetic field to obscure clear view. These are facts, not fantasy. I have no theory, only
reported what was seen. No explanation by base officials."

Going 40,000 mph. - I have spoken with the man who is supposed to have seen this object and it appears to me that here is a rather common occurrence. Four 1 3 they came out as was found in a field of blue sky. I was found to be approximately 600 feet in diameter and had a very rapid spinning motion. It appeared to be almost transparent and it seemed to be slightly glowing. Next day several witnesses came in an trying to identify it and very little could be done. The object shortly disappeared from their sight. But I called Mantel's I strongly that this is the same object that Mantell was chasing and that caused his death.

It would seem to me that a certain of UFO reports particularly those that are contingent on our activities or the activities of others, who may or may not be reliable, simply can't be taken very seriously, those are the ones that are contingent by can be confirmed. I think this is simply an account of a common occurrence.

Sincerely Yours.
