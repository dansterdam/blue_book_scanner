14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what
it moved behind: 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what
in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound No sound
b. Color Silver metal; grey wing with dark ground; thin white edge

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how
much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of this
sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
about a 1/3

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details
of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A hand-drawn sketch of an object with an arrow indicating its movement direction is included on the page]

Here is the OCR text from the document:

20. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object?
(Circle One) Yes No
IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate? 200 MPH North to blue spirit plane

21. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
(Circle One) Yes No
IF you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was? 1 mile to 1 1/2 mile

22. Where were you located when you saw the object?
(Circle One):
a. Inside a building
b. In a car
c. Outdoors
d. In an airplane (type)
e. At sea
f. Other

23. Were you (Circle One)
a. In the business section of a city?
b. In the residential section of a city?
c. In open countryside?
d. Near on airfield?
e. Flying over a city?
f. Flying over open country?
g. Other

24. IF you were MOVING IN AN AUTOMOBILE or other vehicle at the time, then complete the following questions:
24.1 What direction were you moving? (Circle One)
a. North
b. Northeast
c. East
d. Southeast

24.2 How fast were you moving?

24.3 Did you stop at any time while you were looking at the object?
(Circle One) Yes No

25. Did you observe the object through any of the following?
a. Eyeglasses Yes No
b. Sun glasses Yes No
c. Windshield Yes No
d. Window glass Yes No

e. Binoculars Yes No
f. Telescope Yes No
g. Theodolite Yes No
h. Other

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw:
It was just like a small rocket metal of Saturn with the big ring around the middle but turning white bright, very metallic with an 8 square light on leading edge of ring.

Here is the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? ________________
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The document also contains two diagrams: one with a curved line showing angles from 0° to 90° with a landscape scene, and a compass rose. The second diagram shows a simple path with "A" and "B" marked at the beginning and end.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   29   Jul    1956

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: What I saw was like a sighting of some witnessed by a group of about 60 boys. The object was bigger than past sightings of UFO. You were to hold your arm out. It was solid looking going slow like a plane going over. The wing rotated slowly. I would like to know what I saw. It didn't look like boat inversion or a weather balloon. I am not sure exactly when I saw it but I remember it clearly. I have not expected it before because I wasn't aware of this questionnaire. The time was just after dusk. It was almost completely dark. No moon up yet that I noticed but wasn't completely dark. UFO held steady over across sky.

Dear Mr.

This is in reply to your recent letter in further reference to unidentified flying objects.

While the Air Force does not deny that there may be life existing on other planets, there has never been a shred of evidence that would lead anyone to seriously believe that these beings have visited the earth in spaceships. On the contrary, all the investigations made during the past 15 years have tended to strengthen the conviction that unidentified flying objects merely natural phenomena such as meteors or ball lightning, or misinterpretation of some conventional object such as an aircraft, balloon or perhaps even bird.

In the case of Captain Mantell, at the time he was dispatched to investigate a UFO, it was not known that a weather balloon was in the area. When the report of his sighting was checked out, investigation revealed that the Navy had released such a balloon under a then classified project, and therefore its release was known only to those persons actually working on the project.

The Air Force conclusion of the Washington D.C. sightings were that they were due to mirage effects created by a double inversion.

Sincerely,

Dear Gentleman

June 13, 1964

Could you please send me a copy of section 200-2 of the regulations.

Could you also send me a copy of the questionnaire you give to people who reportedly saw a flying saucer or UFO. I have heard that you in the USAF are trying to keep the UFO mystery secret. I have been open UFO chat if I can't explain (maybe) how I had too much evidence to not believe in flying saucers. Of course, don't believe half the stories, but am convinced they exist & would like to know why it is being kept so secret.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Sir,

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the current info. in Project Blue Book & would like to receive the "facts sheets" referred to in the clip you sent me. It is always nice to get back into a story. The USAF is not nearly as long as some "news" people paint it.

I regret to say that I did not receive a copy of AFR 200 2 & would appreciate a copy.

Also I noticed for a copy of your UFO questionnaire. I saw a "UFO" several years ago (not a flying saucer) & would like to know what I saw. In brief it was a "citizen" ring of all & luminous with no form white lights on ring which didn't turn it up after sunset. The object was low in the east. I would like to get a copy of USAF books & find out if it was a UFO, what inversion or heat "flying saucer" was in the info. After this, in Project Blue Book you say that only 7% are really UFO. & there is no evidence to prove they are intelligently, see

Well I have heard UFO minute stories site. I won't heard a word here. Uncertain was living in the Pentagon. I have city heard of people having under the surface of the moon. Many stories I don't believe but I can't help thinking that other planets (not in our I necessarily) have intelligent life & that most believe UFOs are flown by these people. For example several years ago UFO were tracked by radar into Washington (from 1/2 PM to 4AM). They were included at jets both 100 to 500 MPH in speeds. Some UFOs disappeared when they got over Washington only to reappear when the jets left. Next in version yet possible that might no matter what DC thought. Those UFOs were tracked by some fabulous things at patrols speed over Washington including 900 turns etc.

Also many other radar interests have been made & planes scrambled just to track UFOs fly circles around them.

Radar has picked up UFO diving rising 25000 MPH number bombs.

One ship was tracked on radar as

dying 40,000 MPH. These speeds along with
the maneuvers seem to point out a
craft controlled by a highly intelligent
people, if I am wrong, maybe you
can set me straight.

Could you clear up one other thing?
Most of the UFO generation spot Capt. Mantells
F 51 just in a free field of blue cpt.
nobody was found. Cal. Hepler is
the only guy who says a body was
found. Why Capt. Mantells body found?

Personally I don't believe the public
is getting a straight story on the UFO.
It would be nice to get a straight story
but I guess it would also be nice if as
many formations didn't exist. My view
point is simply that a certain % 
of UFO reports (especially radar & visual
sighting from planes) are authentic &
that those are controlled by an advanced
race elsewhere in the universe.

Thank you for your courtesy

Sincerely, Yours
