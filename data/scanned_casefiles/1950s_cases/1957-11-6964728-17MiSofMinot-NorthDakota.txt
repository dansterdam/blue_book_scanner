e. Inclosure #5: There are several unusual things about this reported UFOB sighting. First, the equipment was evidently under control of maintenance personnel at the time of sighting. This could mean that the radar equipment was not in perfect adjustment, or some sort of target simulator or other special equipment was being used in connection with the maintenance operation. (There is no mention of this in the report, however.) Also, the report gives no indication of any attempt to rotate the antenna to a new bearing to determine whether the signal originated inside the equipment. (This question arises since the azimuth of the target was reported to be exactly the same throughout the time of interception and, therefore, appears to indicate that the antenna was not rotating). Further, regular operating personnel are generally more familiar with the appearance of a particular radar scope and could possibly be more reliable observers than maintenance personnel. Hence, it is concluded that possibly a false target due to equipment malfunction rather than an actual target caused the reported radar paint.
