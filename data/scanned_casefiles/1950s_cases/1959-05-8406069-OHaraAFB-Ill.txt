Headquarters
The attached drawing and photo is a photo of a strange object seen in the sky over Tinker AFB, Oklahoma on July 17, 1959.

The object was not visible to the naked eye but was photographed through binoculars. It appeared oblong in shape and moved quite rapidly through the sky.

I would normally state that this was no doubt some type of aircraft, however, the witness states that the object had no visible means of propulsion and that it moved in a very erratic manner.

I would not consider this of any great importance except that the witness is a reliable observer and I have checked the area and find no record of any activity in the vicinity at that time.

Gentlemen:

On 25 July, 1959, I sent a photograph taken at O'Hare Air Force Base on 27 July, 1959. I mentioned in my original letter that I encountered a strange object in the sky that day.

Somebody photographed this aerial phenomenon was returned to me by Major L. J. Tacker, who said that a committee evaluation considered the object in the photograph to be a cloud formation.

The photo was taken during the Armed Forces Day Air Show. There was nothing visible to the naked eye above the aircraft.

As I said in my earlier letter, I would pass it off as a developing or other natural condition, except for the fact that the object does not continue into the border or the edges of the negative.

Would you please send immediate acknowledgment of receipt of this letter and indicate your evaluation when you have completed your analysis. I wish your evaluation.

Respectfully yours,
[Signature redacted]
