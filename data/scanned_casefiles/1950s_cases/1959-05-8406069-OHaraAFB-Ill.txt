Gentlemen:

I took the enclosed photo at O'Hara Air Force Base during the Armed Forces Day Air Show held there on July 17, 1959.

The object was not visible to the naked eye.

I would normally pass it off as defective developing, a light streak or something on the negative. But the fact that if in making a print for the fact that the streak does not continue up on the negative.

I would set the time at somewhere around 1/500 P.M.

The negative is available for examination at my home if it is wanted.

Respectfully yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]

1. The attached photograph was submitted to the ATIC photograph section

is a developing flaw.

2. This Center cannot comment on how this streak may appear on the nega-
tive (reference Par. 3 of AFR 200-2). The negative was requested by this Center on 11 August 1959, through your office, and
was not received.

I am returning the photograph submitted with your letter of 23 July 1959.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center has determined that the object on the photograph is a weather balloon. The negative cannot comment on how this strange appearance on the negative was acquired in August 1959.

Regarding my report and letter of 23 July 1959:

In your answer of 5 January, 1950, received today, you may that you asked for the negative in August of 1959. A check of my files shows that this item was not requested. In fact, there has been no mention of the letter by your office until the letter of the 5th.

If you desire the negative for examination, I would be willing to send it to AFTIC. However, it is return may be guaranteed, as I do not want to risk losing it and the other attached negatives.

I would like to know the official conclusion in the case involving and unidentified flying objects seen over and near AFB, California and 25 March, 1957.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours;

Gentlemen:

On 25 July, 1959, I sent a photograph taken at O'Hara Air Force Base on 17 May, 1959. In my earlier letter, I chronologically stated that it was taken on 17 July.

Recently the photograph was returned to me by Major L.J. Tacker, who said that a complete evaluation was not possible without the negative. Therefore, I am sending the enclosed negative to you so that you may complete your study.

The photo was taken during the Armed Forces Day Air Show, held there on the above date, at approximately 1500 hrs.

There was nothing visible to the naked eye above the aircraft.

As I said in my earlier letter, I would pass it off as defective developing or something of that nature, except for the fact that the streak does not continue into the border or the other negative.

Would you please send immediate acknowledgment of receipt of this letter and negative and return the negative when you are finished. Your evaluation.

Respectfully yours;
