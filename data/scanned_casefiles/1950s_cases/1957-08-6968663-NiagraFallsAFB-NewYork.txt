CONTACTED AND THEY REPORTED A VISUAL SIGHTING. OTHER GCI SITES
CONTACTED REPORTED NEGATIVE CONTACT VISUALLY OR BY RADAR.
THE GOC CENTER IN BUFFALO, NY., REPORTED THE SAME OBJECTS AND
THEIR REPORT INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE BRILLIANT WHITE
LIGHTS ON THE WESTERN HORIZON WHICH GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED BELOW
THE HORIZON. THE MILITARY WEATHER DETACHMENT AT NIAGARA FALLS
MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, NY., REPORTED OR PRESENT. ONE INTERESTING
FACT FROM THE WEATHER REPORT WAS THE PRESENCE OF A CONTINENTAL
POLAR AIR MASS THAT WAS COMPLETELY FREE OF ATMOSPHERIC HAZE,
DUST, AND SMOKE. THIS UNUSUALLY CLEAR ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION
MADE THE INTENSITY OF OBJECTS ON THE WESTERN HORIZON APPEAR
EXTREMELY BRILLIANT. CLEAR DAYS IN THIS AREA ARE RARE DUE TO
THE EVER PRESENT INDUSTRIAL SMOKE AND HAZE PREVALENT IN THIS
AREA. CONSEQUENTLY THERE WERE A GREAT NUMBER OF SIGHTINGS OF
STARS NOT NORMALLY SEEN. THE PRESENCE OF VENUS AND JUPITER IN
THE SAME AREA OF THE SKY WAS DEFINITELY VERIFIED BY DR. JOYCE
MILLS, ASTRONOMER, BUFFALO MUSEUM. THEODOLITE MEASUREMENTS
OF THE POINT IN SPACE OF THE HORIZON WHERE THE OBJECTS DISAPPEARED
CORRESPOND ACCURATELY WITH THE POINT IN OCCUPIED BY VENUS AND
JUPITER AT THE TIME THE OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED.

REFERENCED REPORT HAS FOLG EXPLANATION: THE OBJECTS HAVE BEEN
IDENTIFIED AS THE PLANETS VENUS AND JUPITER. THEODOLITE
MEASUREMENTS OF THE POSITION OF THE TWO OBJECTS INDICATED THAT
THEIR POSITIONS OF THE TWO OBJECTS CORRESPONDED WITH THAT OF
THE TWO PLANETS MENTIONED ABOVE. INTERCEPT ACTION WAS TAKEN AND
THE INTERCEPTOR PILOTS REPORT INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE
STARS, DUE TO THE FACT THAT, AFTER 230 MILES OF PURSUIT AND

SUMMARY: IT IS THE OPINION OF 1ST LT HERBERT D.

ALL INFORMATION COLLECTED POSITIVELY INDICATES THAT THE PLANETS WERE SEEN AND EXPLANATION IS THE MOST LIKELY OF ALL OTHERS CONSIDERED. UFOB C LINE FOUR OF PAGE THREE LOOKED RPT LOOKED
