CONTACTED AND THEY REPORTED A VISUAL SIGHTING. OTHER GCI SITES
CONTACTED REPORTED NEGATIVE CONTACT VISUALLY OR BY RADAR.
THE GC CENTER IN BUFFALO, NY., REPORTED THE SAME OBJECTS AND 
THEIR REPORT INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE BRILLIANT WHITE
LIGHTS ON THE WESTERN HORIZON WHICH GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED BELOW
THE HORIZON. THE MILITARY WEATHER DETACHMENT AT NIAGARA FALLS
MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, NY., REPORTED OR PRESENT. ONE INTERESTING
FACT FROM THE WEATHER REPORT WAS THE PRESENCE OF A CONTINENTAL
POLAR AIR MASS THAT WAS COMPLETELY FREE OF ATMOSPHERIC HAZE,
DUST, AND SMOKE. THIS UNUSUALLY CLEAR ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION
MADE THE INTENSITY OF OBJECTS ON THE WESTERN HORIZON APPEAR
EXTREMELY BRILLIANT. CLEAR DAYS IN THIS AREA ARE RARE DUE TO
THE EVER PRESENT INDUSTRIAL SMOKE AND HAZE PREVALENT IN THIS
AREA. CONSEQUENTLY THERE WERE A GREAT NUMBER OF SIGHTINGS OF 
STARS NOT NORMALLY SEEN. THE PRESENCE OF VENUS AND JUPITER IN
THE SAME AREA OF THE SKY WAS DEFINITELY VERIFIED BY DR. JOYCE
MILLS, ASTRONOMER, BUFFALO MUSEUM. THEODOLITE MEASUREMENTS
OF THE POTIN IN SPACE OF THE HORIZON WHERE THE OBJECTS DISAPPEARED
CORRESPONDED ACCURATELY WITH THE POINT IN OCCUPIED BY VENUS AND
JUPITER AT THE TIME THE PJECTS WERE SIGHTED.
