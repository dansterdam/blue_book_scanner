** STATEMENT **

I observed an unidentified flying object at about 22:00 hours, CST,
27 December 1952, approximately 20 miles South of Canadian, Texas. I
and four other occupants of the car all observed the following phenomena,
and at the time of sighting the night was cold and clear.

I was driving South on US Highway 83 when an intense blueish-white
light caught my attention. The light was comparable to that light which
is emitted from the center of a blue light bulb We were traveling at
a fairly rapid speed and it took but a few minutes before the car could be
pulled over to the side of the road, however, the object when first sighted
was about five degrees to the left of the road.

The object's size was comparable to a baseball and flew at about
two to three thousand feet. The object when first sighted appears
In the Southeast and flew a straight level course to the Northeast.
Then the object passed over the highway on which we were traveling,
it was approximately two to three miles in front of us. As the object
crossed the road it must have been traveling about 300 miles per hour,
but as it continued it seemed to gain velocity.

One thing that I feel is worth mentioning is the fact that in the
two to three minutes that we observed the object no sound was heard.
The intense blueish-white light which emitted fire and yellow as or
fumes from the rear disappeared by going out of our sight range.

I certify that the statement above is true and correct to the best
of my knowledge.

Canadian, Texas 													27 December 1952

I. Description of Incident

Several civilian eye-witnesses observed an unidentified aerial object between 2200 and 2300 hours CST, for two to three minutes. It was described as round, bluish-white light of high intensity and disappeared by going out of sight to the southwest. The object passed low overhead then appeared to climb upward at the end of the sighting. 

II. Discussion of Incident

Local air traffic has not been identified in this sighting. Pending this, the object appears to be a jet aircraft's exhaust seen at a low altitude, perhaps with its afterburner cut in. The night of sighting was extremely clear facilitating observation of any object crossing the sky. No jet noise was heard, however, the observers were in a moving car. The jet may have been based at Amarillo, a nearby air base. 

III. Conclusion

Possibly aircraft.

PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

In compliance with AF Letter 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted.

(1) Object appeared to be round, about the size of a baseball, and emitted a bluish-white light. Only one object was seen. A trail or exhaust which consisted of fire and a yellow fumes being emitted from the rear of the object was the only visible means of propulsion. Eye-witnesses could not agree as to the consistency of the objects altitude. One witness stated that when the object was sighted it was at a altitude of three thousand feet and gained altitude as it moved across the skies, the other said that the altitude of three thousand feet stayed constant throughout the entire flight of the object. Speed was estimated at about three hundred miles per hour when first sighted and about a thousand when last seen. Object disappeared by going beyond the sight range of the eyes.

(2) Time of sighting was 2200 hours to 2300 hours, CST, 27 December 1952 and was observed for about two to three minutes.

(3) A visual surface observation without optical or electronic equipment was made.

(4) Observers were thirty miles South of Canadian, Texas traveling South on US Highway 83. Object was first observed in the Northeast and travelled in a southwesterly direction.

(5) Object was observed by air----------- San Antonio, Texas, his ex-wife------------- and his son-------------, A/10-------------- Lackland AFB, Texas, and his wife also accompanied Mr.-------------- and his family and witnessed the phenomena. Reliability of the witnesses is unknown, however, Mr. ------------ states that he was a crew chief of a B-29 during 1945 and a one time employee of Brook Aircraft Q Kelly AFB base, Texas, and that he is acquainted with all conventional type aircraft.

(6) A cold clear night with a light layer of snow on the ground prevailed at the time of sighting.

(7) No activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, known to have existed at the time which may have accounted for the sighting.

(8) No physical evidence of the sighting.

(9) No interception or identification action taken.

(10) Location of any air traffic in the general area at the time of the sighting unknown.

                                     STATEMENT

On Saturday, the 27th of December 1952, between 2300 and 2400 hours, I was riding in a car approximately 50 miles South of Canadian, Texas, on US Highway 83. Four other occupants and I were traveling due South, when there appeared before us an intense bluish-white light. The light was different than any light I have ever seen on any conventional type aircraft, in that, it had a "Fluorescent" type color and brightness. The light at first appeared in the Southeast at an altitude of about two to four thousand feet, as the object flew in what seemed to be a straight line to the Northwest, it climbed to approximately a mile and a half in altitude.

When the object traveled from the Southeast to the Northwest it passed ahead and above our car which was pulled to the side of the road. As the object flew across our field of vision, and we got a somewhat side view of it, we could see that sparks and fire were emitted as though from an exhaust. The object was traveling directly into the wind and sparks could be seen trailing the bluish-white light. This was the only visible means of propulsion, however, no sound whatsoever could be heard as the object moved across the skies. No estimation of size or construction could be made as the object passed by so quickly, that only the intense light and fire trail could accurately be seen.

I would estimate that the object stayed in vision for about two or three minutes and did not disappear by loosing velocity or light, but continued on its course beyond the sight range of our eyes. When the object was first sighted it was about two miles away with a velocity of two or three hundred miles per hour. As it climbed and moved across the skies, its velocity increased to about eight hundred to a thousand miles per hour.

At the time the above took place the night was cold and clear with a light layer of snow on the ground. All the occupants of the car observed the phenomena depicted above and all agreed it did not resemble any conventional type aircraft known to us. I was a B-29 crew chief during the last war and cannot recall any type aircraft that even resembled this object.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
