AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Langley Air Force Base, Va.     TAG IR-23-52     PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGE

1. Seven yellowish-orange flying objects were sighted visually from the ground by Captain and Mrs. [redacted] on 11 August 1952 with an instructor with the 4400th School Squadron, Langley Air Force Base, Va.

2. The first two objects were sighted by Captain and Mrs. [redacted] as they were riding in their vehicle from their home near Chapel, Hampton, Va., along Route 134 to Hampton proper. Source's location was approximately 1/2 mile from his headlights on a concrete overpass. The time of sighting was approximately 2130 EST. Later at approximately 2000 feet, source saw four additional objects, three flying at 34-5000 feet and one at 7000 feet. His location was near handing 8.1 Area Port Nichole, Va. to Franklin, Va. The time of this sighting was approximately 2151 EST.

3. All objects flew with a steady motion. Source observed that the two original objects pulled up in a chandelle, reversed heading on top of chandelle and headed S.W. from source's location near Franklin, Va. No noticeable climb was observable in climbing. The intensity of the yellowish-orange light emitted by the objects was constant. The total length of observation was 5 minutes.

4. At approximately 2200 EST source returned along the same route and sighted a second object of the same description as the previous six. However, this object was flying extremely low, appearing to skim the treetops in its flight. Caution was taken and it was noted to be in area York-Kearns to Franklin, Va. During this and other sightings, no moon was out.

5. Hampton weather: 2130 EST; 28000 feet scattered; visibility 6 miles haze; present 1015 millibars; temperature 81 degrees; DT 74; winds 6 & 5 knots; altitude 29.97; isothermal layer 5-5000 feet.

6. Langley Control Tower Operator dispatched one B-26 to identify and intercept flying objects. Reported result was negative. An additional B-23 type aircraft were over the local area at time of sighting. Captain [redacted] claimed but he was able to differentiate between the flying objects and local aircraft.

This light looked exactly like an plane at a distance 9 or 10 miles. Quite would not have been noticed. Watching it when flying. The light seemed to turn from an orange to a reddish orange as it came near to the horizon and just before going out of sight. Then children called my attention to it.
