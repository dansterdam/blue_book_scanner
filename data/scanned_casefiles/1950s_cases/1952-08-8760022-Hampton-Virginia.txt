AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

CASM NU: IR-23-52
PAGE: 1 of 1
PAGES:

1.    Seven yellowish-orange flying objects were sighted visually from the ground by Captain and Mrs. (deletion) (A03) on 11 August. Subject officer is an instructor with the 4400th School Squadron, Langley Air Force Base, Va.
2.    The first two objects were sighted by Captain and Mrs. (deletion) as they were riding in their vehicle from their home at (deletion) Pine Chapel, Hampton, Va., along Route 134 to Hampton proposr. Source's immediate reaction after seeing the two objects, was to interpret them as reflections of his headlights off antennae. The time of sighting was approximately 2130 EST. Captain (deletion) estimated the altitude to be 500 feet and the speed 400 mph. Stopping at the intersection of Freeman Drive and Route 134, source saw four additional objects, three flying at 3 - 4000 feet and one at 7000 feet. Like the previous two objects, these were headl.ng nn frm Fort Monroe. Va.. to Franklin, Va. The t.me of this sighting was approximately 2134 EST.
3.    All objects flew with a steady motion. Source observed that the two original objects pulled up in a chandelle, reversed heading on top of clandelle and headed Sfrt fr Fort Monroe, Va., to Franklin, Va. No directional was noticeable in climbing. The intensity of the yellowish-orange light emitted by the objects was constant. The total length of observation was 5 minutes.
4.    At approximately 2200 EST source returned along the same route and sightings seventh object of the same description as the previous six. However, this object was flying extremely low, appearing to skim the treetops in i.s flight. Captain (deletion) estimated its heading to be SW from Fort Monroe to Franklin, Va. During this and other sightings, no moon was out.
5.    Hampton weather: 2130 EST; 25000 feet scattered; visibility 6 miles haze; pressure 1015 millibars; temperature 81 degrees; DP 74; winds SW 5 knots; altimeter 29.97; isothermal layer 5 - 6000 feet.
6.    Langley Control Tower Operator dispatched one B-26 to identity and intercept flying objects. Negative results were reported. An additional 24 F-23 type aircraft were over the local area at time of sighting. Captain (deletion) claimed that he was able to differentiate between the flying objects and local aircraft.
