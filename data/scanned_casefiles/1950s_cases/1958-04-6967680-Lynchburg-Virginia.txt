ORIGINAL REPORT WAS FILED WITH HQ. 354TH AIR DIVISION (DEF).
MAPLETON, GEORGIA, IMMEDIATELY AFTER LANDING THERE.
ON 16 APR. 1958 [REF. MESSAGE BW DOI 58-122 CIRVIS
REPORT FROM 836TH A DIV LANGLEY AFB, VA.]

The weather was good, with only high stratus.
We were flying at 6000'. This flying object appeared
15° to 20° above the horizon in a straight path,
rotating slowly, and passed off my left wing
(and slightly below it) at a distance estimated at
1000'. The object was lost to sight as it
plunged into the ground due to terrain and foliage.
Its speed was estimated at 300 r.p.h. and it was in sight
a total of four seconds. It maintained what appeared
to be a straight path, slowly rotating, and was
not falling at all near a tactical path, but
was falling thus:
