Flying Saucer
With Us Again,
Over Theater

Lo and behold--up comes another flying saucer story. This time it comes from a man who should know what he's talking about--Aubrey Yates, Jefferson County sheriff's deputy who's licensed flier and a member of the Air Force Reserve.

Mr. Yates, who lives at 3116 Avenue E, Fairfield, went to the Fair Park drive-in movie last night. Midway the movie, he looked up, saw a "cigar-shaped object right above us."

"My wife saw it, too, and we watched it for about 15 minutes," said the deputy. "It looked like a cigar burning on both ends--with big glows with a kind of soft glow between."

Then all at once, the thing disappeared. "It went straight up and disappeared in about three seconds," Yates said.

At the sheriff's bureau, Yates said he received several other calls, describing the objects as Yates did.

"But we didn't see anything," they said.

Yates was sure it wasn't the glow of the steel mills, because a cloud passed between the object and the ground, blacking it out.

"If I had been reflecting," said Yates, "I would have shown on the cloud."

The puzzled deputy said he was sure it wasn't any kind of airplane. "But whatever it was, it scared hell out of me."
