PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE
22 August 1956

2. LOCATION
Bornholm, Denmark

3. TYPE OF SIGHTING
Local

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
☑ Ground-Visual ☐ Ground-Radar ☐ Air-Visual ☐ Air-Intercept Radar

5. PHOTOS
☐ Yes
☐ No

6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
approximately 3 hours

7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
four

8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Radars first reported 2-3 objects on an easterly heading at 700 knots, no altitude given. Approximately 2 hours later appeared, but were orbiting over the location (53 dgr, 20 min N - 18 dgr, 00 min E) at at 25,000 ft and 700 knots. About 1½ hours later tracks added.

9. COURSE
Not clearly legible

11. COMMENTS
The appearing & disappearing of tracks on this radar scope is characteristic of "spurious blips". The fact that the objs were "orbiting" over one spot at 700 knots supports this conclusion. Location surveyed is approximately 50 miles south of Danzig, Poland. The above characteristics (orbit at high speed) make it highly improbable these objects were Soviet guided missiles.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown

8. Bornholm Case (AFR Base)). The 'electronic-temporary inversion' approach towards explaining this sighting submitted to CINCUSAFE and his USAFE was considered appropriate, considering the limited information.

Bornholm Case

There is insufficient track data to determine the nature of the track - whether it is erratic, changing speed a direction, rapidly, (as is usual in most of these sightings) or whether the acceleration and course changes are smooth.

The reference to picking up "3 to 5 unidentified objects" at time 0850Z at least infer that the targets were not steady, but were appearing and disappearing.

If this is true, these targets are out in a similar manner to those sighted at Lakenheath, and appear, therefore, to be only due to anomalous propagation or weather returns.

As in the other sightings, it is not possible to make a thorough evaluation without scope photos, more complete track position and time data, weather information, (temporal inversion, moisture layer data) etc. etc.

f. Bornholm Case (RAW Base): The "electronics-temperature inversion" approach toward completing this sighting submitted to CINCUSART and HQ USAFE was considered appropriate, considering the listed information.

Conclusion Case 4

There is insufficient track data to determine the nature of the track - whether it is erratic, changing speed and direction rapidly, (as is usual in most of these sightings) or whether the acceleration and course change are smooth.

The reference to picking up "3 to 5 unidentified objects" at time 0850z at least infers that the targets were not steady but were appearing and disappearing. If this is true, there targets are acting in similar manner to those sighted at Lakenheath, and appear, therefore, to probably due to anomalous propagation or weather returns.

At the other sightings, it is not possible to make a thorough evaluation without some more complete track-position data, weather information, (temperature inversion, moisture type data) etc., etc.

explain observed erratic movements and tremendous speeds of supposed solid target.

Temperature inversions can cause radar beam projected upward to bend down and pick up objects on the ground, appearing as objects in the air. Other strong evidence of weather return is disappearance of all targets simultaneously. Under certain conditions, inversion layers can cause interference between two radar stations some distance apart. Interference can be checked by changing frequency 20 to 40 megacycles, if settings can be varied. All can often be confusing to trained, experienced radar operators.

PART III: Specifically, track data submitted insufficient to determine nature of track whether erratic, rapidly changing speed and direction (as is usual in most sightings of this nature), or whether acceleration patterns and course changes are smooth. Reference to picking up 3 to 5 unidentified objects at 0850 Z* at least infers that targets not steady, but appearing and disappearing. If true, targets observed are somewhat similar in manner to Lakenheath Bentwaters England sightings.

MEMORANDUM FOR COL JOHNSON AND COL GREEN

SUBJECT: Bornholm Radar UFO Sighting

1. During one of Mr. Archer's recent visits to Gen. Levis, a query was made regarding the status of subject sighting. ATIC-4 indicated on the basis of the limited information submitted is that these objects which present themselves on the Bornholm Radar scopes were the result of anomalous propagation, i.e., the number of blips suddenly disappearing are characteristic of unusual weather conditions which does effect radar.

2. In respect to this phenomena being guided missiles, ATIC's evaluation is that the existence of several orbiting objects in the air at the same time does not conclusively point to possibly guided missiles. However, this does not conform to existing test and flight philosophy for guided missiles. Also, there is no information for guided missiles or ATIC activity known to have concerning this place on 25 August 1956 and fall within the radar coverage of the Bornholm Radar. We have requested more information in a form conclusion.

3. Would appreciate if the above information, in substance, be passed on to Gen Levis.
