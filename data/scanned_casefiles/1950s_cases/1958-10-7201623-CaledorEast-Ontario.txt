Elliptical obj estimated at 10ft x 20ft. A"real flying saucer," aluminum, speed fast & then slow. Observed at top of one mile descending to 13 ft. Direction of travel NE. Color silver. Rose by secret method of jerks & flops. No sound until obj exploded. 10 min observation during daylight. Made seven attempts to land in a field 30ft in wings & then halled one ft above the ground where it remained motionless for exactly 5 mins. At this time a red glow started at 1 end & when the entire obj was glowing

11. COMMENTS
it then exploded. Witness ran away. Has told everyone in the neighborhood but can't convince anyone it wasn't a hallucination.

Apparently the witness believes that he saw some sort of attempt at a hoax so indicated. If the event reported actually happened, there would have been some remains in the area or explosion, if nothing more than charred ground. As listed as convinced that obj was actually there.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Header/Location]
Caledon East, Ont.

[Body of text - partially legible due to handwritten script]

Dear:

[Several paragraphs of handwritten text, mostly illegible]

Date: 10/31/58
[Some additional handwritten text with times and measurements, partially legible]

[Bottom of page has additional handwritten text that is difficult to fully transcribe]

Note: While I can see the text exists, much of the handwritten script is too difficult to definitively transcribe with complete accuracy. The document appears to be a handwritten letter or report from Caledon East, Ontario, dated 10/31/58.

The text in the image is largely handwritten and somewhat difficult to read in its entirety. The first few lines at the top are partially illegible. The document appears to be a handwritten report or statement, written in cursive script on lined paper. There are three small circular marks/holes on the page - one at the top right, one in the middle right, and one at the bottom right of the document. A thick black line crosses through part of the text near the top of the page. While I can see the text is present, the cursive handwriting and image quality make it challenging to confidently transcribe the full text with complete accuracy.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

N.B. The [illegible text] that I have [illegible text] to [illegible text]

"The Lauen"
