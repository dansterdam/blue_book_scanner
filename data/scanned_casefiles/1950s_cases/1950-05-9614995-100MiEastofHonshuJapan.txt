AF FORM 112 - PART I
UNCLASSIFIED

Country: Japan
Report No: TN-132-50
Subject: Sighting of Unidentified Object
Location: Honshu, Japan
Date of Observation: 20 June 1950
Date of Transmission: 19 May 1950
By Whom: Maj. Edward H. McLean
Source: Two (2) F-6Q Fighter Pilots
Headquarters: F/F, APO 925
Evaluation: B-3

SUMMARY:
Report of the sighting of an unidentified object by two (2) F-6Q pilots at 40°30'N-146°24'E (100 miles East of Honshu, Japan) at 1040', on 19 May 1950.

An object was first detected around radar and the pilots were given a vector at 103QK. At 1040' the pilots made contact with an object. Several passes were made in an effort to determine its identity. The pilots spent the next six being similarly to a box kite in appearance and having the approximate dimensions of thirty inches by twenty-four inches. (Incl #1-2-3a). To validate means of spotting the object was found and both pilots reported that it appeared to remain stationary. The object was observed from 1000' to 1005'.

At 1000'K a dropsonde was released from an RB-29 reconnaissance aircraft in the approximate vicinity of the sighting. (Incl #5). The dropsonde is similar in appearance to the reported sighting, and it reached the surface at 1015'K.

COMMENT OF APPROVING OFFICER:
Since the object cannot be positively identified as the dropsonde, due to the incongruity of the time element, this report is forwarded for your information.
