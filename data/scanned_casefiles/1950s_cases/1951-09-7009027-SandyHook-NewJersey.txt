Lt Rogers demurred, saying that it was probably illegal for the civilian to photograph the map. The photographer answered that he had many times taken a picture of people in front of this very map, and a picture was taken. A second picture was taken of Lt. Rogers and a Captain (by officer), posed at a table with the map.

The unknown captain did not wish to have his name used, but consented to pose.

The civilians subsequently left.

Lt Rogers left Mitchell for Dover that evening.

d. On 11-12 Sept 1951, exact date indeterminable at this moment, MSC ea. led Maj Ballard at Dover from New York, asking for information pertaining to the incident over Sandy Hook. The major replied that he was sorry not to be able to discuss the matter with them, but transferred then to Lt. Payne, the PIO (Public Information Officer) concerned. Lt. Payne later provided them with a "highly classified message," and that he refused release, but offered to check on possibility of obtaining release. He called SADS, who called USAF, and the men were told by Psy to "go ahead, can clearance wasn't forthcoming, and that the matter should be forgotten.

e. Later, a Lt. Best at Dover received a call in operations from Associated Press. For Maj Balla rd, who told Lt Best, so say he was not there.

f. On 17 MAY ordered Maj Ballard and Lt Rogers to Detachment 7.

g. Information: About 20 September 1951, Robert Johnson of Republic Aviation called Maj Ballard and asked for permission to visit his interest in the incident. Maj Ballard said that he knew Johnson and Mr. Brewster of Republic were authorized to discuss the incident with Lt. Rogers and Maj Ballard. This discussion proceeded with record track, range, time of sighting, duration of sighting, color, altitude, and heading. The asked specifically concerning a result, and offered several sketches for identification—more or less tentatively. The subj ect interviewed was learning that Brewster was studying the matter, that USAF and ATIC personnel would soon arrive to investigate, and that Brewster had some notes of people that had reported similar objects previously.

h. Until the interrogation reported here was made, there were no further inquiries concerning their sighting of 16 Sept 1951.

4. It is worth noting that the additional information received is that the officers have not previously revealed their estimate of speed of 700-800 mph to persons questioning, except those, and that only during the inadvertent transmission to Samworth was this speed quoted.

5. Previous reports that Lt Rogers had determined that Samworth had negative results in attempting to track are negated by Rogers. Neither he nor Maj Ballard know whether Samworth tracker or whether Samworth got a return on the object in question.

Flying Saucer report 11 September 1951

A P-33 Jet fighter landed at Mitchell at 1145 yesterday, the 10th of September. The pilot reported that they had seen in the sky over Sandy Hook a round object moving at a terrific rate of speed. With an arc like motion it was within their field of vision for about two minutes. They were travelling at 450 miles an hour, at a height of 20,000 feet. The object was approximately 8000 feet below them. They peeled off to take a closer look at it, and chased it to Asbury Park, whence it veered out to sea. They believe that the sun's rays are being reflected from the object because it had that effect, that is it shone, whatever it was. They reported this to operations officer when they landed, and somehow it got to the ears of one of the local newspapers on Long Island.

Col F: Yes, you made a release on it, is that correct?

Maj B: I made no release on it, said nothing, but then I got the press inquiries. (I gave them the facts as reported to me by the pilot) The pilots made no mention of the fact that they saw a flying saucer, but merely reported that they saw a strange object, moving at a speed they estimate to be in excess of 900 miles an hour, in an arc-like direction, over Sandy Hook. In response to the press inquiries, we gave the facts as reported to us by the (pilot), who were by name Lt. W. Rogers, who was piloting, and Capt. B. Ballard, who was piloting Interceptor Wing at Dover.

Col F: Yes, I'm getting it, so ahead.

Maj B: I think I've given you the basic facts of the matter. I don't know how word reached the newspapers early, but as required by regulations, when I was asked to check the story by the press, I checked it, I found out the report to be true and I released the story, as given to me by the pilots.

Col T: All right, may I ask you at this point whether you personally interviewed
the pilots?

Maj B: I talked to one of them on the phone, but I didn't see them.

Col T: Was he able to give you any additional description of the object, as to
its apparent shape, methods of propulsion, possible construction, and
so on?

Maj B: No, he said it was a round object which reflected the sun's rays, in-
dicating a metallic surface. That information supports simply my inter-
polation. - They say it reflected well. - That it was moving in an arc-like
direction, they said it was an arc-like movement, not straight, - in an
arc, and that when they got approximately 6000 feet from it, it veered,
and went out to sea and vanished completely. Now I was told by Lt. Rogers
that he communicated with one of the radar outposts in this vicinity, and
asked them to check, and he told me that the response was entirely nega-
tive. Nothing appeared on the screen.

Col T: The radar unit did check during the time of operation and did not report
anything appearing on the radar scope.

Maj B: That as I remember it Rogers conversation with me, - at the time I didn't
make any particular note of it but it has since come up, and seems to be
important and I believe that's true. The Colonel, perhaps you'll want
to talk to some of those pilots at Dover. They are at Dover today.

Col T: They are assigned to a Fighter Interceptor wing at Dover. Is that Dover,
Delaware? Dover, Maryland

Maj B: I believe it's Delaware Sir, but I'm not certain

Col T: Yes. What is the designation of their unit, do you know?

Maj B: It was 146th Fighter Interceptor Unit.


- page 5 -

Col T: One four eight

Maj B: 148th Fighter Interceptor, 798, - either Wing or Group.

Col T: All right, - we are very glad indeed to have this information and we'll evaluate it here, one reason I wanted to get a complete report from you so that I can turn it over to our Intelligence people here. And we will get in touch with you if we would like to ask you to take any more action on it.

Maj B: All right Sir.

Col T: Meanwhile, I don't see anything else you could have done in the circumstances, concerning the Press. I'm glad to know that no release was initiated, but I can easily

Maj B: I assure you Colonel that my office knew nothing about this story until they were queried by the newspapers.

Col T: That's good. I understand that and that's a very good thing. - I'm glad you handled it that way. So we will let you know if there is any official action to it here, - meanwhile if you get any additional information please call me again.

Maj B: Right Sir, - now can I give you my extension in case you need it?

Col T: If you will Sir, please.

Maj B: It's Extension 3125, or 2221. My full name is Major John Barron.

Col T: All right, - thank you very much indeed.

FROM: Counter Intelligence Div, Mr. Special Investigations, The Inspector General

FOR COMMENT ONE 1 OCT 1951
COMMENT NO. 1

1. At approximately 0330 hours on 1 October 1951, a WX was received by OSI, District #2, 67 Broad Street, New York 4, N. Y., from Lt. Colonel Nathan Robert Rosengarten, AFOIN-NTIA-2, Wright-Patterson AFB, which requested an investigation as to the circumstances surrounding a press release on 11 September 1951 concerning an aerial object observed over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The article, as released, was substantially as follows:

Two pilots from Dover AFB, Delaware, reported they saw a strange moving object in the sky over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The speed of the object was estimated to be in an excess of nine hundred (900) miles an hour. The object was in their field of vision for approximately two minutes, and appeared to be moving in an arc like motion. They were unable to state exactly what they saw but certainly saw something. The officers were flying a T-33 and are assigned to the 148th Fighter Interceptor Wing, Dover AFB.

2. Pursuant to the request of Lt. Colonel Rosengarten, Major Bernard Barron, USAF AO-100L292, PIO, 2500th Air Base Group, Mitchell AFB, N. Y. was interviewed on 1 October 1951 by agents of OSI District #2. He stated that Nick Aurelio, a reporter for Newsday, a daily newspaper published at Hempstead, Long Island, N. Y., telephoned at various times on 10 September 1951 in an effort to obtain the story. Major Barron, at first, told Aurelio that nothing had occurred, but Aurelio called back and stated that he was positive that the two officers had seen a mysterious object, at which time Aurelio requested permission to interview 1st Lt. Wilson S. Rogers, the pilot of the aircraft. Inasmuch as flying objects are not classified information, Aurelio was given permission to interview Rogers. As an article, passing from his interview, appeared in Newsday on 11 September 1951, and apparently was sent to both the Associated Press and United Press because on the morning of 11 September, Barron received telephone calls from various newspapers, including the New York Journal American, Command, both of Mitchell AFB; Air Material Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and Colonel Washington, Field Liaison Section, Director of Public Relations, Headquarters USAF.

No one mentioned anything about a possible violation of AFR 205-1. The PIO did not release the story. Major Barron stated that his instructions are to cooperate with the Press.

the Press and, accordingly, when he was requested by Aurelio for permission to interview Lt. Rogers, the request was granted.

3. Mr. Dick Aurelio was interviewed on 1 October 1951, and his story is as follows:

At about 1400 hours 10 September 1951, he overheard a couple of airmen, rank unknown, talking about a report of an unusual object cited by two pilots who had landed at Mitchell AFB. This conversation was overheard in a diner located at Hempstead, New York.

At 1230 hours, 10 September, Aurelio called Major Barron and asked him about a report of an unusual object. At first, Barron said he had no report but would check and let Aurelio know. Barron checked with Operations and called Aurelio back and told him that he had no information on a Jet landing at Mitchell AFB. Aurelio, apparently, was not satisfied and thought there was some basis for the report he had overheard and conducted a check of his own and called Major Barron back. Aurelio stated that he had spoken to a Lt. Pearson at Base Operations, Mitchell AFB and when Pearson was reluctant to talk, Aurelio thought that something had occurred. Barron checked further and discovered an incident, was, in fact, reported by Lt. Rogers and his passenger, who was a Captain Edward Ballard, Jr. At that time Aurelio asked for permission to interview Lt. Rogers, which was granted. Aurelio accompanied a photographer who took a picture of Lt. Rogers.

4. An initial report of investigation is being prepared by OSI District #2, which, upon forwarding to this headquarters to date, will be furnished your Directorate and AIC upon receipt by this office.

DETAILS:

1. Investigation predicated upon a TWX, PMC 0422, from Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, by Lt. Colonel ROSENGARTEN, AFOIN-ATIA-2, to investigate circumstances of release of information to the press by Public Information Officer, Mitchell Air Force Base, New York, 10 September 1951.

AT MITCHELL AIR FORCE BASE, NEW YORK

2. This investigation conducted by Special Agent PAUL L. MC COY.

3. On 1 October 1951, the Public Information Officer, Mitchell Air Force Base, Major JOHN B. BARRON, AO-1001292, was interviewed relative to any press release on 10 September 1951 which may have constituted a violation of security.

4. Major BARRON informed the writer that the only release out of the ordinary was concerning an unknown object that had been sighted over Sandy Hook, New Jersey, by two pilots flying into Mitchell Air Force Base.

5. Major BARRON was requested to furnish the writer any information which he might have concerning the appearance of a newspaper article which appeared in the 11 September 1951 edition of NEWSDAY, a Long Island daily paper.

6. Major BARRON dictated the following statement concerning the article, in the presence of the writer, to the CSI stenographer:

"1 October 1951

"At 1430 hours, on 10 September 1951, I received a telephone call from Mr. DICK AURELIO, a reporter for NEWSDAY. Mr. AURELIO asked me to check into a report which his newspaper had received, that a strange object had been seen by two pilots from Dover Air Force Base over Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

"I called Base Operations and talked to a Sergeant on duty. He told me that he had no knowledge of such a report.

"I called Mr. AURELIO to tell him we knew nothing about such a report.

"At 1500 hours, Mr. AURELIO again called me and said that he had positive information that two pilots had seen a strange object in the sky. I again called Base Operations. Lt. FRANCIS, when I believe to the Assistant Base Operations Officer, confirmed the report that two transient pilots from Dover Air Force Base had seen a strange object in the sky over Sandy Hook.

"I called Mr. AURELIO and informed him that the report of an unknown object being sighted was apparently accurate. He requested that he be permitted to interview the two pilots. In accordance with established Public Information policy, such permission was granted. Mr. AURELIO came to this

Base Operations building, where he talked to Lt ROGERS, one of the two pilots, about the incident. The story appeared in WEDNESDAY over his by-line on 11 September.

"To the best of my recollection, I then took the following steps: 1)
at 0300 hours, 11 September, I initiated a series of telephone calls to apprise my higher headquarters of the fact that a newspaper story would appear about that was called by the reporter to be a "Flying Saucer" story. I called the Public Information Officer of Hq First Air Force, Major THOMAS BILLINGTON. I then called the assistant Public Information Officer of Hq Continental Air Command, Captain FRED KREUZER. I also called Colonel CARTER of the Field Liaison Section, Directorate of Public Relations, Hq USAF, Colonel CARTER suggested that I call the Public Information Officer of Air Materiel Command, stating that Command would officially not comment on news stories about flying saucers. Colonel TAYLOR, Public Information Officer, Air Materiel Command, made a recording of my telephone report. On the same morning, Major GEORGE called me from Washington for further details, which I gave him. Also, on the suggestion of Colonel CURRAN, I telephoned the Base Operations Officer at Dover Air Force Base, and requested that he have the pilot submit an immediate report to Hq USAF, attention Public Information Office, and to the Public Information Officer of the Air Materiel Command.

"Throughout the 11th of September, I received telephone calls from practically every newspaper and news agency in New York City. My answer to their queries was to this effect: "Yes, two pilots reported a strange moving object in the sky over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. They reported it as moving rapidly and as descending in its movements." In several cases I was asked for official comment. I declined to comment in view of the Air Force Public Information Office policy. Also, on the morning of the 11th of September, I briefed Base Commander LOUIS ... as to what had happened and my version of the story.

"At no time did I, or any of my staff, make a release on this story. Our procedure was to answer telephonic inquiries in the normal fashion. Since this was not a classified matter, the news was treated in the normal fashion. Facts at our disposal were placed at the disposal of any media representative who called. A also requested the Base Operations Officer to investigate any possible regulation which necessitated a report by his office. The entire story was treated as an unclassified matter. The Public Information Officer that since the press had expressed a desire to get the story, and since there was nothing classified about the information, it then became his obligation to present the facts as to what had been reported to him.

"On 11 September, the media representatives who queried me on the story were the following:

Dr. GEORGE CARROLL, Aviation Editor for Journal-American
New York Times
Herald Tribune
Daily News
Associated Press
United Press

I received other calls which are not clear in my memory.

"The following representation was given to all press inquiries, to the best of my recollection: 'Two pilots from Dover Air Force Base have reported that they saw a strange moving object in the sky over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. It was moving at an extremely rapid rate which was estimated in excess of 600 miles an hour. They had the object in their field of vision for approximately two minutes. They reported that it moved with an arc-like motion. They are not able to say exactly what they saw, at the same time they are quite sure that they saw something'. At no time did I suggest that the pilots say a flying saucer. I am fully aware of the Air Force attitude toward flying saucers and would, under no circumstances, suggest to any member of the press that an Air Force pilot saw an object fully identified as a flying saucer."

AT HEMPSTEAD, NEW YORK

7. On 1 October 1951, Mr. RICHARD H. AURELIO, reporter for NEWSDAY who writes under the by-line of DICK AURELIO, was interviewed at his residence, 23 Villa Court Street, Hempstead, New York. In substance, AURELIO stated that he first heard about the unusual flying object 30 September 1951 while in a diner near Mitchell Air Force Base. Two airmen were discussing the landing of a jet at Mitchell, the pilot of which reported seeing an unidentifiable flying object off Sandy Hook, New Jersey. AURELIO stated that he returned to his office and called Major BARON, Public Information Officer at Mitchell Air Force Base, to verify the information he had overheard. BARON called him back shortly to inform him that Operations had no information concerning the report of flying saucers or unverified aircraft.

8. AURELIO then asked BARON to have the call switched to Operations and he talked to Lt. PEARSON. AURELIO stated PEARSON would not answer questions and was reluctant to talk, which led him to believe that PEARSON was withholding information concerning the information which he (AURELIO) had overheard. AURELIO called BARON again and told him to call PEARSON, that he believed PEARSON had knowledge of what the two pilots had seen. BARON called back shortly and confirmed the report that two transient pilots had seen a strange object in the sky over Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

9. AURELIO stated that he then requested permission to interview the pilots, which was granted by BARON. AURELIO then advised his editor of the possibility of a story and was directed to interview the pilots. AURELIO did contact/did interview this pilot, a member of the 142nd Fighter Interceptor Wing located at Dover, Delaware, who gave him the information which was carried as a story the following day, 11 September 1951. Captain EDWARD BALLARD, Jr., passenger in the aircraft piloted by ROGERS, was not available for interview. AURELIO then returned to his office and wrote up the interview.

10. The following morning the story was released over the wires of the United Press and the Associated Press. AURELIO stated that this made the story available to all newspapers affiliated with the United Press and Associated Press. The information was not released until the morning of 21 September, in order that NEWSDAY would be the first paper to carry the story.

11. AURELIO stated that he would be unable to identify the airmen whom he had overheard in the diner. He was unable to recall their ranks and could only hazard a guess as to where they might work on the Base. His impression was that they were mechanics and were discussing information which they had overheard.

AT MITCHEL AIR FORCE BASE, NEW YORK

12. On 2 October 1951, Major THOMAS W. ELLINGTON, AC-80091, Public Information Officer, Hq First Air Force, was interviewed concerning the news article in question. ELLINGTON stated that he had knowledge of the story in question and that, in his opinion, there had not been a violation of security, since he knew of no regulation or policy which prohibited reporters from writing stories concerning Air Force activities which were unclassified.

13. ELLINGTON was of the opinion that since no regulation or policy existed which set forth instructions of releasing information to the press, unless classified, the instant matter was handled in accordance with AFR 190-6, dated 27 April 1951, title: AIR FORCE PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAM.

14. Paragraphs 2b and c of AFR 190-6 are set forth below:

Par 2b: "Air Information: Consisting of the collection, correlation, analysis and dissemination to the public of unclassified information pertaining to the Air Force. This aspect of the program is based on the policy that the full record of the Air Force is available to the American people, subject only to security restrictions and the dictates of good taste."

Par 2c: "Civil Liaison: Consisting of full cooperation with civilian individuals and organizations in matters of mutual interest and responsibility. This aspect of the program is based on the policy that harmonious relations with the civilian population will be maintained."

15. On 2 October 1951, AURELIO called his editor to inform him that a statement which he had stated he would prepare would not be made, since his editor had advised him that any information concerning news items or activities of reporters of NEWSDAY would be cleared through the editor of NEWSDAY. No attempt was made to interview the editor.

PORT MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY, INCIDENTS

On 10 and 11 September 1951, a series of both visual and radar sightings were reported from the Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, area.

I. VISUAL SIGHTING BY PILOT AND PASSENGER OF T-33 AIRCRAFT

A. Discussion

At approximately 1135 COST an unidentified object was sighted by the pilot of a T-33 aircraft, an Air Force Lieutenant, enroute to Mitchel Air Force Base, New York, from Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. The object appeared to be over sandy hooks, New Jersey, between 5000 ft. and 2000 ft. at 11 o'clock from the aircraft heading. The T-33 was approximately over Point Pleasant, New Jersey, at the time of the initial sighting. Upon seeing the object, the pilot started descending at 300° turn to the left in an attempt to intercept and identify the object. Approximately 45 seconds after the initial pitch, the object, the passenger, an Air Force Major, who had been making a radio check, sighted the object. The object was then near Freehold, New Jersey, making a 120° turn toward the coast. The pilot continued his 300 turn but the object was lost at its closest point. During the descending turn the speed of the T-33 increased from 450 to 550 m.h. and the altitude decreased from 70,000 ft. to 17,000 ft. (See enclosed overlay.)

When first sighted, the object appeared to be descending over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. It then leveled out and maintained a constant altitude. The object was painted an silvery and had no reflux or tail light. At one time during the attempted intercept, it appeared flat. The size was judged to be 30 ft. to 50 ft. in diameter.

At approximately 1112 EST, 10 September 1951, two balloons were released from the Vans Signal Laboratory, New Jersey, located at 40° 19' N and 74° 04' W. (two enclosed overlays). These balloons were 7 ft. - 8 ft. in diameter at time of release and expand on ascending. They ascend at an average of 300 fpm and are painted silver for radar tracking. Experienced balloon observers state that when viewed from certain angle, they appear to be disc-shaped, at 12-15,000 ft. These balloons would have been at approximately 12,900 ft., and would have moved to a position nearly in line with Point Pleasant, New Jersey, and Sandy Hook. (And 8.5 at 10-15 knots.)

Attempts were made to use the information obtained from the interrogation of the T-33 crew and the data on the balloon landing to prove that the pilot and passenger of the T-33 had observed a balloon. However, not all of the data given was consistent with such a conclusion.

In an attempt to establish the fact that the object was a balloon, a flight path drill to the one from by the T-33 crew was assumed. (See "Warners Path of T-33" in enclosure.) The T-33 crew was interested twice and gave different flight paths and traces of the object at each one. It is therefore assumed that due to the altitude and speed of the T-33, and the fact

that grew we intent on watching the object, they could not pin point their ground track any closer than 5 nautical miles and thus it would be feasible to assume a flight path within 5 nautical miles of the river track. Since the two interrogations as to location of the ground track differ slightly to some extent, the track marked on a chart included with signed statement is assumed to be more nearly correct.

Referring to the assumed flight path on the enclosed overlay, at A, the object appeared to be over Sandy Hook. It will be noted that a comparatively small object close to the a/c would appear to be large in assumed to be over Sandy Hook. (See Figure 1.)

Sandy Hook, N. J.

Balloon would appear to be large if judged to be over Sandy Hook.

At the T-23 as reached the balloon, the balloon appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, several seconds must have passed. After the initial sighting, while the pilot decided that the object was not a conventional a/c and that he should attempt to identify it. During this period, it is assumed that the a/c continued on course making the pilot's observation less direct and level on a reciprocal heading. The fact that the object appeared to be level when first sighted cannot be explained. The fact that only one of the two balloons was seen can be explained by the fact that the observer concentrated on one balloon and did not notice the other one.

Forty-Five seconds after the initial sighting, the observer noted the object to be terrain left near Tuckahoe, New Jersey. This can be explained it was too far that the L-37 was trailing. The relative motion could be calculated by cancer to be from 10 to 15 miles per hour. By this method a minute to six or sky and terrain silver (ionol) line was the frame and we do so. This does concern "of balls" is a common occurrence with short period random balloons.

It is apparent from the above that it was not made to be made in or by the L-37 but the object was a balloon in a near vicinity and the fact that it was 10-15 and observed was more of a thin act track and a true wind or evidence to the same effect. Now, in these conditions there made, it cannot be concluded that the object was definitely a balloon.

II. RADAR TRACKING PROCEDURE AND RESULTS

4. Discussion

All of the radar sightings made this period were made by students at the Port Monmouth Training Center. A detailed list, the students involved with a detailed mechanical description, was not possible. In the radar set used, let to the extent that it could readily available. It was evident there was a problem in this case, he was allowed to work. The net was to a large extent, low or late of any type were lost. It should be noted that these factors were maintenance not state, but were.

1. In 10 or better 1951 an A/C was most of time up in a test-flying, 10-12,000 ft. above a. (exact altitude not clear) approximately 1110 hours. At this time a portion of the test was to determine the target area to work with follow a certain plan. The aircraft was the only military aircraft in the area at this time. The major not was utilized to eliminate certain tracking difficulties.

From information, it was found that the operator, who had more experience than a new area object, was critical in a group of visitors at the time. Because of his inability to use the A/C or obtain true and which will normally track, an attempt was made to 10-8 ft. ... not to will track. The target was not a/c, was also not stationary, and the track of the object of an a/c in the area. This was the reason.

In definite conclusions can be given due to the lack of accurate data with this particular case. It is felt that the track was not a/c, was not a balloon, was in an area very close to the ground, and the tracking was poor. The track was ill-defined and the operator was not favorable for analysis. This

2. On 10 September 1951, 1815 hours, an SCR 584, serial number 433, tracked a target which moved about slowly in azimuth north of Fort Monmouth at a range of about 37,000 yards at the extreme low elevation, angle of 150 mils, (altitude approximately 93,000 ft.). This was proven to be a weather balloon. It was tracked at the request of the Commanding Officer of the Student Detachment to determine its altitude. In addition, it was a coincidence to determine what the altitude of a balloon which was sighted right to.

3. On 11 September 1951, 1050 hours, two SCR 584's, serial number 217 and 215, picked up the same target northeast of Fort Monmouth at an elevation circle of 50 to 700 mils at a range of approximately 30,000 yards (approximate altitude 31,000 feet). The sets found it impossible to track the target in range due to its poor and erratic performance. The operators had to report a manual range tracking in order to hold the target. The target was traced in this manner to the maximum tracking range of 30,000 yards. The operators judged the target to be moving at a speed higher than the maximum aided tracking ability of the radar sets. This target provided an extremely strong return both at maximum range, however, the echo signal periodically fell off to a 1 yard below normal return, these echoes coincided with maneuvers of the target.

This sighting proved to be a weather balloon. Now it was determined unknown that A/C was involved that it was a balloon by A/IC telecon 15-75, dated 5 October 1951, Car Item 1, which stated: "Weather sighting was later confirmed; as weather balloon, later traced vertical, later exploded and descended to ground."

4. On 11 September 1951, at about 1730, a target was picked up on an SCR-584 radar set, serial number 14, that displayed unusual maneuverability. The target was approximately over Hawthorne, New Jersey, as indicated by its 10, 20, and 30 mile range. At this mark, the target remained practically stationary on the scope and appeared to be hovering. The operators looked out of the van in an attempt to see the target since it was not such. However, short range conditions prevented such observation. Returning to their operating positions the target was observed to be changing its elevation at an extreme, rapid rate, the change in range was so small the operators believed the target was hovering vertically. The target ceased its rise in elevation at an elevation angle of approximately 1,500 mils at which time it proceeded to move at an extreme; rapid rate in range in a southerly direction over the target changing the radar tracking ability of the SCR-584 so that manual tracking became necessary. The radar traced the target to the maximum range of 35,000 yards at which the target was at an elevation of 100 mils. The operators at that point did not attempt to judge the speed in excess of the above tracking rate of 700 mph.

It is highly probable that this is an example of anomalous propagation as the weather on 11 September was favorable for this type of phenomenon. The students at that time were aware of this phenomenon, however, it is highly probable that due to the wartime scientific training of what they thought were unusual types of aircraft, they were in the correct psychological condition to see more such objects.

III. CONCLUSIONS

UNCLASSIFIED

A. The unidentified aircraft reported by the L-49 pilots was probably a balloon launched by the Army Signal Laboratory a few minutes before the L-49 arrived in the area.

B. The 1110 ELST radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was not necessarily a very high-speed aircraft. Its speed was normal, the operator's inability to use side tracking and this was possibly due to the operator being confused, and not the true speed of the aircraft.

C. The 1915 ELST radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was a weather balloon.

D. The 1050 ELST radar sighting on 11 September 1951 was a weather balloon.

E. The 1330 ELST radar sighting on 11 September 1951 remains unknown but it was very possible that it was due to anomalous propagation or the student radar operators' thoughts that there was a great deal of activity of unusual objects in the area.

Appendix VI
PORT MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY - 10-11 September 1951

On 10 and 11 September 1951, a series of incidents occurred in the area of Port Monmouth, N. J. An initial sighting of an unidentified object was made on a radar set. Soon after the radar sighting, two Air Force officers in a C-33 aircraft unsuccessfully attempted to intercept an unidentified object. Later several more radar sightings were reported.

Status of Investigation

A complete investigation of this incident was carried out and will be reported in Project Grudge Special Report No. 1. It has been tentatively determined that the T-33 pilots probably observed a balloon trail. A few minutes prior to their arrival in the area, two of the radar sightings were returns from balloons and the others were probably the same. The radar return changed to exclude the original sighting. However, the incident seemed to reveal the inability to track the object was due to the inability to properly operate the GCI under mental stress.

1. The following report is in accordance with ADC Letter 200-1, Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft:

a. The unidentified object which was sighted at about 1135 DST Monday September 10th was round and flat in shape. The size of the unconventional object is estimated to be the same as a fighter or light bomber, 30-50 feet in diameter. Only one object was sighted and no exhaust or trail was observed at any time. The estimated speed of the object calculated by distance of 35 miles in two minutes. Only one time was the object seen edgewise and it appeared definitely discus-shaped; the rest of the time it was in a port turn, disappearing as it went out to sea.

b. Time of observation was between 1135 and 1140 DST. Duration of the observation was about two minutes.

c. The manner of observation was visual. The object was sighted from an Air Force T-33 which was on a routing training flight from Dover Air Force Base. The T-33 was cruising at 20,000 making good about 450 miles per hour when the object was sighted at least 12,000' below at eleven o'clock position. After making a gradual 130 degree descending turn to 17,000' the T-33 was making good over 500 miles per hour when the object disappeared out to sea.

d. The observers were above and the south of the object when it was first sighted. Observers plan was over Point Pleasant and the object was over Sandy Hook, N. J. when it was first sighted. The object flew southwest over Red Bank and started a gradual port turn to about 120 degrees, crossing just south of Point Pleasant and heading out to sea.

e. The observers were 1st Lt Wilbert S. Rogers and Major Ezra Ballard, Jr. Both men are experienced fighter pilots.

Flying Saucer report 11 September 1951

A P-33 Jet fighter landed at Mitchell at 1145 yesterday, the 10th of September,

The pilot reported that they had seen in the sky over Sandy Hook a round object moving at a terrific rate of speed. With an arc like motion it was within their field of vision for about two minutes. They were travelling at 450 miles an hour, at a height of 20,000 feet. The object was approximately 8000 feet below them. They peeled off to take a closer look at it, and chased it to Asbury Park, whence it veered out to sea. They believe that the sun's rays were being reflected from the object because it had that effect, that is it shone, whatever it was. They reported this to operations officer when they landed, and somehow it got to the ears of one of the local newspapers on Long Island.

Col T: Yes, you made no release on it, is that correct?

Maj B: I made no release on it, said nothing, but then I got the press inquiries, (I gave then the facts as reported to me by the pilot). The pilots made no mention of the fact that they saw a flying saucer, but merely reported that they had seen a strange object, moving at a speed they estimate to be in excess of 900 miles an hour, in an arc-like direction, over Sandy Hook. In response to the press inquiries, we gave the facts as reported to us by the two pilots, who were by name Lt. W. Rogers, who was piloting the ship at the time, and Capt. E. Ballard, Jr., both of the Fighter Interceptor Wing at Dover.

Col T: Yes, I'm getting it, go ahead.

Maj B: I think I've given you the basic facts of the matter. I don't know how word reached the newspapers here, but as required by regulations, when I was asked to check the story by the press, I checked it, I found out the report to be true and I released the story, as given to me by the pilots.

The map appears to be a detailed navigational or aeronautical chart of the New York and New Jersey area, with numerous lines, radio ranges, and location markers.


- page 34 -

Col T: All right, may I ask you at this point whether you personally interviewed the pilots?

Maj B: I talked to one of them on the phone, but I didn't see them.

Col T: Was he able to give you any additional description of the object, as to its apparent shape, methods of propulsion, possible construction, and so on?

Maj B: No, he said it was a round object which reflected the sun's rays, indicating a metallic surface. That supports simply my interpolation. - They say it reflected rays. - That it was moving in an arc-like direction, they said it was an arc-like movement, not straight, - in an arc, and that when they got approximately 5000 feet from it, it veered, and went out to sea and vanished completely. Now I was told by Lt. Rogers that he communicated with one of the radar set-ups in this vicinity, and asked them to check, and he told me that the response was entirely negative. Nothing appeared on the screen.

Col T: The radar unit did check during the time of operation and did not report anything appearing on the radar scope.

Maj B: That as I remember Lt. Rogers conversation with me, - at the time I didn't make any particular note of it but it has since come up, and seems to be important and I believe that's true. Now, Colonel, perhaps you'll want to talk to one of those pilots at Dover. They are at Dover today.

Col T: They are assigned to a fighter interceptor wing at Dover? Is that Dover, Delaware? Dover, Maryland?

Maj B: I believe it's Delaware Sir, but I'm not certain.

Col T: Yes. What is the designation of their unit, do you know?

Maj B: It was 148th Fighter Interceptor Unit.

Col T: One four eight

Maj B: 148th Fighter Interceptor, yes, - either Wing or Group.

Col T: All right, - we are very glad indeed to have this information and we'll evaluate it here, one reason I wanted to get a complete report from you so that I can turn it over to our Intelligence people here. And we will get in touch with you if we would like to ask you to take any more action on it.

Maj B: All right Sir.

Col T: Meanwhile, I don't see anything else you could have done in the circumstances, concerning the Press. I'm glad to know that no release was initiated, but I can easily

Maj B: I assure you Colonel that my office knew said nothing about this story until they were queried by the newspapers.

Col T: That's good. I understand that and that's a very good thing, - I'm glad you handled it that way. So we will let you know if there is any official action to it here, - meanwhile if you get any additional information please call me again.

MajB: Right Sir, - now can I give you my extension in case you need it?

Col T: If you will Sir, please.

Maj B: It's Extension 3115, or 2221. My full name is Major John Barron.

Col T: All right, - thank you very much indeed.

DAYTON, OHIO

Pilot Says He Saw Odd Object
Speed Over Coast at 900 M.P.H.
By the Associated Press

MITCHELL AIR FORCE BASE, N.Y., Sept. 11.—An Air Force jet pilot reports sighting a mysterious round object speeding about 300 miles per hour over the New Jersey coastline.

The report came yesterday from Lt. Wilbert S. Rogers, 28, attached to the Air Force base at Dover, Del.

Lt. Rogers told officers here about the strange object after landing with Capt. Edward Ballard, Jr. as his passenger on a flight from Dover in a T-33 Jet trainer.

"I don't know whether it was a flying saucer," Lt. Rogers said. "But it sure was something I've never seen before."

The World War II veteran from Columbia, Pa., was reminded that various units of the armed forces have knocked down reports of "flying saucers" and that most have been explained as weather balloons.

"This couldn't have been a balloon," he said. "And besides, no balloons goes that fast."

Here's Lt. Rogers' description of what he and Capt. Ballard saw:

While flying over Sandy Hook, N.J., at 20,000 feet at an altitude of 20,000 feet at 11:35 a.m. 10:33 EST yesterday, they spotted a white or silver circular object below them at about 12,000 feet altitude moving inward. The object appeared to be about the size of a fighter plane.

As they followed the object, it moved in an arc from Sandy Hook to Red Bank, which is inland in New Jersey, then out to Asbury Park on the coast, and out to sea in a southeasterly direction.

The object disappeared after the Air Force plane had followed it about 30 miles, getting as close as 8,000 feet to it.

The object did not seem to be moving from the Air Force plane, and its speed appeared constant. It had dropped to about 2,000 feet altitude before the two men lost sight of it.

Capt. Ballard left for Dover to report on the occurrence to the 148th Fighter Interceptor Wing, Rogers said.

STATEMENT

17 September 1951

While participating in a training flight from Dover AFB, Delaware to Mitchell AFB, New York, over Asbury Park, New Jersey, I sighted an unidentified object over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. I was pilot of a T-33 type aircraft, cruising at 20,000 feet, making good a 450 mph. At the time of sighting of the object, Major Ballard was making a position report to San Neork, Continental. While Major Ballard was making his position report, I started timing the object from the time I saw it and followed it in a descending turn to the left. About 15 seconds after I first sighted the object, I clued Major Ballard and pointed the object out to him. The object continued a port turn, disappearing out to sea south of Asbury Park, N.J. From the time I first sighted the object until it disappeared, two minutes elapsed, with the object covering a distance of about 35 miles.

The size of the object was approximately that of a fighter plane, 30 to 50 feet in diameter. The object was silver or metallic in color, had no markings, emitted no exhaust or trail. Most of the time during which I had the object in sight, it appeared to be circular in shape, however, at one time I saw it edgewise where it gave a flat appearance. The design of the object could be said to be identical to a disc as in track events. I could not say whether or not the object was spinning. Throughout the time of my observation, the object was to my left and considerably below our altitude. When first sighted I would judge that it was between 5 and 8,000 feet over Sandy Hook, as is noted on the attached map. It appeared to be descending when I first saw it at Sandy Hook and appeared to level out in flight just north of Red Bank, New Jersey and continued on the same altitude until it disappeared. At the point of our first sighting of the object, I started a descending 360 degree turn to the left at the same altitude until it disappeared. From 20,000 feet to 17,000 feet, gaining airspeed from 450 mph to 550 mph on a course paralleling that of the object until it was lost from sight.

In our training and daily practice as intercept pilots, we must note accurately the time at which the object of the interception is first sighted. I did this authoritatively when I first sighted the object over Sandy Hook and noted the time to be approximately 1135 EMT, 10 September 1951. Although we were on a direct course for the destination of Mitchell AFB at 20,000 feet over the time of the sighting, it was so made at the speed of the object that I immediately started to track the turn to the left and waited for Major Ballard to get through with the radio conversation he was having with San Worth so I could point the object out to him. As soon as he completed the radio check in, I called the object to his attention and we both watched it make a 90 degree turn to the left and kept it under observation together. While it appeared to be banking approximately 20 miles and disappeared out to sea. The object appeared to be banking as its course described a gradual 90 degree turn to the left.

SUMMARY:

On 10 September, Major Ballard and Lt. Rogers were participating in a training flight from Dover AFB, Delaware to Mitchell AFB, New York (Direct), when they spotted an unidentified cloud over Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

The time was 1135 EDT, and the weather was CAVU. When spotted, the object was at an estimated altitude of 8,000 feet. Flying at 20,000 feet, the pilot immediately made a diving turn in his T-33 and followed and timed the object until it disappeared two minutes later.

Both pilots observed the strange object, which appeared to be the size of an F-86 but much faster (900+ mph), disc-shaped, steady in flight with no visible means of propulsion, and only silver in color.

At 1110 EDT a radar station at Ft. Monmouth plotted an unidentified, high speed (above 700 mph) object in approximately the same location.

This headquarters has no information regarding natural phenomena, experimental aircraft or guided missiles that could have caused the observations.

Request USAF evaluation of incident be furnished this headquarters.

On 10 September, Major Ballard and Lt. Rogers of the 118th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, spotted an unidentified object over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Their F-33 was at 20,000 feet, the object was well below, heading southwest. Lt. Rogers was first to sight the object (1135 EDT) since Major Ballard was making a position report.

Lt. Rogers followed the object in a diving turn to the left descending to an altitude of about 16,000 feet with the object about 8,000 feet below and to the right of the aircraft. Thereafter he tried to keep a course paralleling, but above, that of the object.

As soon as Major Ballard completed his radio check-in he was notified of the strange object. Both watched it make a 90 degree turn to the left and kept it under observation together while it covered approximately 20 miles before it disappeared out to sea. (Refer to statements of pilots and maps)

Lt. Rogers, in control of the F-33, had the object in sight for about two minutes with the object covering a distance of about 35 miles; Major Ballard had the object in sight for less than a minute. As to the weather and description of the object see attached statements.

On the same date a radar station at Ft. Monmouth reported two targets that were unidentified, traveling over 700 mph, and giving returns that could not be explained as being equipment malfunction, anomalous propagation, or anything but an actual target as described in the attached report. However, the possibility exists that the news item reporting the observation by the fighter pilots could have caused the imaginations of the radar observers to run wild. This is considered remote in view of the number of observers witnessing the scope returns and the fact that Lou Incidentals are reported in two days. However, the possibility is being investigated and results will be submitted upon receipt.

1. All personnel listed in initial report from Ft. Monmouth were students, with the exception of Mr. Norman Meier. Mr. Meier has been a qualified radar observer since 1942 and states he had no knowledge of a "flying saucer" report prior to observation. Further states observed target was not similar to any observation ever made by him.

2. Item listed in paragraph 2, initial Ft. Monmouth report, was later identified as a balloon.

3. Radar data at Ft. Monmouth were in first class mechanical condition. However, tests will be conducted during this calendar year to 10 September in order to check possibility of recurrence of targets and/or explanation for same.

4. At variance with paragraph 1, above, is fact that the Ft. Monmouth F10 called the radar section on the morning of 10 September making if they had seen anything unusual. A negative reply was received by the BCO, but word-spread throughout the outfit that something was going on.

16 October 1951

The purpose of the information recorded on this wire recording is to summarize results of a field investigation accomplished by Col. N. R. Rosengarten and Lt. J. W. Cummings between the period of 28 September and 2 October 1951. The material recorded herein in chronological fashion although some organization will be introduced in handling the information derived from persons interrogated in Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey. The trip originated was a receipt at approximately 1400 at Air Technical Intelligence Center of Teletype No. 246, Telecon Item CSAF Item 2. This telecon was sent down from AFOIN-W/TC.

The reported sightings on 10 September 1951 and on 11 September 1951 by electronic and visual means of unidentified flying objects. Col. Kirkland had been advised early in the morning on 28 September that Gen. Cabell's office was desirous of knowing concerning a sighting at Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey.

Therefore, the Project Monitor of "Grudge" Project extracted from the files information that had been received on the Ft. Monmouth sighting and related same to Col. Kirkland. Now Col. Kirkland made a telephone call to Washington and advised me to stand by that fact action would be necessary on this because of the General's personal interest. Therefore, a stenographer was alerted since it was expected that information might be received after working hours were completed or to work over would be necessary to accomplish the mission indicated by Col. Kirkland. However, no information reached us until 4 P.M., quitting time. At that moment, Mr. Deyarmond informed that a message had come in, that they had sought the Project Monitor and that discussion was being accomplished in Electronics Branch. Consequently, Col. Rosengarten and Lt.

Note: This is full of errors. So use it cautiously - Errors made in transcribing from wire.

Cummings accompanied by Mr. Deyarmond went to the Electronics Branch and learned that the stated telecon had arrived some yards in length and it was being discussed by Electronics Branch and Mr. Zimmerman. The decision was made soon after that meeting was broke up that we had been delayed already two hours and we might as well get into the field because information necessary for evaluation was not present in the communication from TCB and that other information seemed likely to be had. The decision was then submitted by a request in the subject telecon CSAF Item 2 as follows. It is advisable to make an evaluation of these incidents recommend a full investigation to obtain a complete report of the incident and related circumstances. Evaluations and conclusions should be forwarded to this HQ by teleconference. Immediate investigation must be made. Findings must be related immediately to this HQ not later than Monday, 1 October 1951, following information concerning these instances is quoted for preliminary analysis to be made immediately for Gen Gabell and then EADS, HQ, Stewart Air Force Base interrogations concerning radar and visual sightings are quoted. Now Col Kirkland was contacted and travel orders were written at a late hour in the evening so that Col Rosengarten and Lt Cummings boarded a TWA airplane for New York at about 11:30 that night. About 10 o'clock on Saturday morning Lt Cummings and Col Rosengarten reached Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, and contacted their G-2 of the Signal Corps station, Ft. Monmouth. Arrangements were made to begin immediate interrogation of personnel concerning electronics sightings through the cooperation of G-2, Base Commander, acting through Col Murmano. The persons interrogated are as follows: PFC Clark, Pvt Abelle, Pvt Allen, Pvt Mason, Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Meyer,

in preparation for becoming an instructor at Fort Monmouth where he is actually functioning in that capacity now. PFC Geary was operating an MPG type set
MG-1 and consequently his information and that of Mr. Meyer's are somewhat
more reliable scope than that of the students. No purpose seems to be served
in detailing the results of the interrogations of these men but rather we will
go at once to the items of CSAF Item No. 2 in order to discuss the influence of
the interrogations on the material presented in these items are the basic
teleconference telecon Item No. 1, September 10, 1951, PG-1 radar
set picked up a fast moving low flying target, etc. This is under the auspices
under the operation of PFC Clark at that time. PFC Clark was operating the set
unattended at that time. This set has a nominal range of 12 to 14,000 yds., the
set is zeroed in azimuth using a compass on stakes so that 0° for a set in
azimuth is magnetic north field approximately with experimental error of the
situation may set it upon. PFC Clark was making a demonstration for some
visiting non-technical officers at the time he observed Item No. 1. It was
his intention to obtain a target to lock the target in on automatic semi-aided
tracking and to demonstrate this feature as such, he is successful almost as
soon as he started the demonstration of finding a saturation echo on a PPI scope
with almost constant target heading, on attempting to lock in a sided tracking.
However, he was considerably flustered by the fact that the aided tracking
would not keep up with the object. After several attempts to maintain aided
tracking of this target, he determined that the speed was too high for aided
tracking of about 700/mps. Because of the circumstances of the demonstration he
quickly tried to pass to another target and was finally successful in demonstrating a ground target, namely, the Highlands which lie between the station

5

and New York City. Interrogator regarded anomalous propagation involving trapping effects and gave negative indications and was verified by other personnel. Weather shows that September 10 in that area was not one favoring anomalous propagation but the September 11 was. We have indications evidenced by PFC Clark was that ground quarter was of a normal nature and was not extending inside of 5,000 yds. prior 3 centimeters set of the MPG type or others were in operation in the area at that station to the knowledge PFC Clark and other personnel there which eliminates interference effects. Note that no pif shape may be discussed here in order to fix the current size of target because of the use of the PPI scope alone and aided tracking was not possible. PFC Clark began operation on this instance at approximately 11:15 and the operation was ended by 11:18 approximately. This is EDST. Maximum duration of sighting approximately 3 seconds at one time although 45 seconds in a row. It could not be verified 10 September 1951 was fixed in the telecon, however, the student with reference to other events would fix this as 11 September or 12 September. This is given a low evaluation. It is believed, in fact it was on September 10. The MPG set had been in operation since 1100, that is warming up, for 15 minutes before the demonstration began in which the target was picked. This story interrogation by PFC Clark was high azimuth rate target traveling north bound up the Jersey course from Belmont. It was lost near Sandy Hook, he said. Following the course line changing the range only slightly but changing azimuth rapidly. The target was lost in the northeast at a range of 14,000 yds. Operator initially identified the target as a ship and then realized it could not be a ship. PFC Clark upon interrogation stated that he intended to say operator found a target near location of ship is usually found and realized it was not

a ship. Now finding a reinterrogation of PFC Clark independent of the pre-
viously accomplished one indicated azimuth variation from 315 to 205°, remember
this is magnetic. Notice that the stories are radically different, and it is
the opinion that consequence of firm statements by PFC Clark, one must conclude
that the track is not that specified by CSAF Item No. 2 nor are they the track
which begins at a heading of about 315 magnetic and changes continuously to
about 205 magnetic. This would put the track very similar to that of the object
observed by Major Ballard and Lt Rogers, airborne at about that time. There is
no more significant information to report of CSAF Item 2, subparagraph 1.

Reference paragraph 2 stating on 10 September 1951, 1515 hours ABSCR 584,
S-33 shortly before track-target, etc. It is given an A-1 evaluation that
this target was a balloon. It was tracked at the request of the Commanding
Officer of the Student Attachment to determine the altitude in order to es-
tablish who won a pool concerning what the altitude of the balloon which is
sighted might be. The pool was formed by several officers at a risk of $1 a
head concerning this target. It is a significant feature here which lies in favor
with the discussion of balloons. So much for Item 2, Paragraph 2.

Paragraph 3. On 11 September 1951 at 1050 hours, two SCR 584 Serial sets
217 and 315 picked up the same target north of Ft. Monmouth at an evaluation
of 245 to 300 miles range of 30,000 yds., etc. The interesting part of this
sighting is that it was inspired by alert which was based to magnetograph. It
involves further Mr. Meyer the instructor previously mentioned and Pvt Mason
the MIT graduate, previously mentioned. Pvt Mason and a crew of two other
men were training in a radar set which was in operation at the particular moment
just prior to the signal received at 1050 hours. The instructor, Mr. Meyer, was

advised that he should put all sets into watch in the search in order to
watch for unidentified flying objects. In order to do this, he had another
instructor point out directly to his students and advise them that they should
search at once for unidentified flying objects. Pvt Mason and the other two men
were among the students who were notified. Another instructor went directly to SCR
584 set No. 217 put it on the air. It had previously been warmed up that morning.
Almost at once Pvt Mason and his crew announced to Mr. Meyer that they had a
target high speed and strong. Mr. Meyer investigated and observed the target
himself on the scope, noticed the azimuth and went directly to set 217 searched
in the proper azimuth for the same target and soon succeeded in finding it.
Indication of a target of greater than B-25 size generally of the B-29 size
interrupted distinguished from a B-36 size aircraft. Mr. Meyer had personally
tracked on several occasions and could distinguish, he said, from a balloon
stating that it was definitely not a balloon he had in the scope. Target
first appeared at 0° azimuth and varied 250 to 50 in azimuth. During turns
the pip would diminish in the manner which was characteristic of jet aircraft
at that range. He put the scope on tracking because they would keep the
target in aided tracking by assisting the operation by applying torque to
the hand wheel. G-2 Coenhower whose age is 31, is at least a B reliability.
He is cleared for Secret, however, other weather information showed existence of
fronts lying out from Fort Monmouth in such a nature with the radar load pro-
jecting downwards would give signals somewhat like the type observed. It is
not an evaluation. There is not sufficient data from which to make an evaluation.
Only the indications are given here. Very little sensible information could be

- page 68 -

solicited from Pvt Mason and his crew due to the difficulties of time having
elapsed and the student's being confused by their training program, speaking
specifically of a rigid detail and routine to which they are subjected. This
should not be construed to be a criticism in that their technical capabilities
seem to be unusually great for students showing that their training course is
likely a very good one. Notice that paragraph 3 of basic communication includes
two unrelated reports. Pvt Mason and his crew are identified with No. 4, SCR
Serial No. 315. Mr. Meyer identified with this Serial No. 217, Item 3. Now
it is proper to discuss SCR Set Serial No. 315 of Item 3 identifying this was
Pvt Allen and his crew. Pvt Allen, Pvt Abello of this crew were interrogated.
It developed that Pvt Allen was operating the set alone at the time he picked
up the signal. He did not relate the information that morning to his fellow
students but rather waited until that afternoon. Although they were within
easy hearing distance at the time he identified the target on the scope, the
situation is too confused again in this instance to state specifically any
findings. It may be concluded, however, that weather could have had a definite
effect upon this target as well. Some question may be introduced concerning why
Pvt Allen would fail immediately to notify his fellow members of such an unusual
target had he seen it and indeed not mention it during the lunch but wait until
that afternoon late in order to reveal it. It is not to be construed as an
evaluation again. There is not sufficient data to arrive at a conclusion. The
time to be ascribed to paragraph 3 should be approximately 1037 WCT. Interrogation of the student personnel occupied Saturday, Saturday night, and Sunday
morning and part of Sunday afternoon. Much time was spent attempting to fix

with greater detail dates, time, and circumstances in order to find something
of value. However, it was realized after all this was accomplished, it had been
in vain, absolutely too much time had elapsed for human memory to recover the
detail necessary for further evaluation. Then, the two pilots, Major Ballard
flying as observer, and Lt Rogers who was flying as pilot of a T-33, sighted
an unidentified flying object and they flew into Fort Monmouth for interrogation.
The story was verified, questioned, analyzed, discussed, and the pilots remained
firmly convinced of the details which they had sighted. However, certain circumstances were indications that they did not possess the detail which they
claimed concerning a track of the flying object they claimed to have seen. They
were interrogated at great length concerning the circumstances whereby this
report concerning the flying object they saw reached the press and also a
request was — signed for investigation of the base PIO
officer at Mitchell Air Force Base, a Major Warren, in order to clarify his
part in the activity. It is sufficient to state that neither Ballard or Rogers
made a voluntary statement to press and that Rogers made his statement to the
press only when he was directed to do so by Major Warren, Base PIO, and this
is according to Rogers statement only. An interrogation of the personnel at
Twin Lights Radar Station was undertaken and it was learned that Twin Lights
was off the air at the time the sightings occurred on 10 September. Visual
and radar sightings are referred to in this instance. Operating hours at
that time at Twin Lights were 0400 to 0800 and 1930 to 2330 only. Therefore,
there is no verification from Twin Lights loss of the sighting one way or
the other. However, Staff Sgt Pallock who was monitoring channel fox at the

11

Capt McNicholas; Dr. Bennett; Col Munnumro; Agent Debora; Agent and Chief Reed, both of G-2; and consequently, Lt Rogers and Major Ballard of Dover Air Force Base, pilots concerned; Major Markin, Commanding Technical Officer of Twin Light Radar Station; Staff Sgt Pallot, Monitor radar box channel, Twin Lights Radio Station; and incidental individuals.

Reference to basic GPAS, Item No. 2 of the telecon of 28 September 1951 will show the names of Clark, Aboile, Mason, and Myer. These individuals were concerned with operations of radar stations from which signals were seen on 10 and 11 September. Now the significant fact learned at Port Monmouth was that the students were operating radar sets in a training center that these students were not connected with practical operations. They maintained no plotting records and they did not plot and did not log any of their findings. Circumstances were basically that as students who were being trained in maintenance at this training facility and that an instructor put certain mechanical or electronic difficulties into radar sets of the SCR 584-A type. The students were charged for determining the malfunction causes and eliminating those causes. If the students were successful in eliminating the causes and peaking their set to higher radiation efficiencies, early in their phase of the program associated with these sets, they were permitted to operate the sets much the same as a tactical operation for the balance of the period to which they were assigned to a particular set.

This is an important item in connection with the following interrogations in that three students were assigned to each set and these three students were required to operate alone, not providing a man for allowing or coordinating by plots. It was considered incidentally desirable by the students to operate the sets as a sort of privilege and they attempted to do this whenever possible.

station overheard a radio check and conversations between the pilots which is
discussed in detail in other reports enclosed in the folder. He reports
that the conversation was an exciting one and verified roughly the statements
Rogers and Ballard made concerning what they revealed over the air. He fixed
the time as only about 11:45 EDST and could not fix the date. Pallock is
evaluated "A" by his personnel. He is cleared for secret. Dr. Bennett was
queried concerning possible activities of a countermeasure station in which
he works which might have an effect of giving spurious signals to radar sets
operating in the area. His answer to these proposals were unqualified
negative. He was interrogated by Col Rosengarten and his report is filed in
the project folder. Mr. Hoffman, Capt McNicholas, Agent DeHorn, Agent-in-
Chief Reid, were all interrogated concerning the circumstances of alerts which were
given student operators at that station. Mr. Taylor is not recorded here as

of Twin Lights and gave the information of the hours of which the station was
on the air. With some seven hours of sleep, and one or two meals, the infield
parting, that is Col Rosengarten and Lt Cummings chartered an airplane at Red-
banks Airport for Washington, D. C. at approximately 1:30 P.M. reaching Wash-
ington at approximately 3:30 P.M. in time to brief Gen. Cabell's staff and to
give a very preliminary rundown of what had been accomplished, to Gen. Cabell
himself that evening. The airplane was chartered because although the Signal
Corps attempt to use their liaison airplane to take us to Washington, the
liaison airplane was torn down for periodic inspection. It would have been
necessary to wait until the next day by rail or other transportation been

relied upon. Work continued in Washington and Gen. Gabell wanted to be
briefed on Tuesday in detail. We checked with Col Kirkland and learned
that he wished us to leave behind in Washington as short and incomplete
a record as possible pending our firm commitment to Washington as a power of
center commitment at a later date after we had the opportunity to study the
data in detail. This we were successful in accomplishing. We did have the work
in Washington on Tuesday morning and afternoon in order to determine the
possibility for balloon and experimental aircraft situations as the incident
reported. Balloon results were, until after we left Washington, negative as
were experimental aircraft possibilities. Agencies contacted with this respect
were Gen Mills, a Mr. Beloin in Minneapolis, Minn., a Mrs. Whelan of the
Signal Corps Research Development Center in the Pentagon, Dr. Jack Holloway,
and Dr. Lytle of the Office of Naval Research, Major Vickens of Abbey-Dick
Project in the Pentagon, and others incidental in discovering the identity
of these project monitors. The weather bureau was contacted for the weather
report. Command Post personnel were contacted to determine whether any reports
from the Eastern Air Defense Command might have reported any sightings which
we did not have. These results were negative. Persons contacted include:
Col Lambert, Eastern Air Defense Command, AC&W Officer, at the Pentagon; Col
Corry, Command Post Commanding Officer; Lt Col Hubber, Command Post Deputy, and personnel in the message centers. The following conclusions were left with Gen.
Gabell's staff, Hartford and Ball, and qualified to them as particularly preliminary conclusions. Reference to the telecon message again CSAF Item 2,

basic information which applies possibly in with the airborne sighting.

Paragraph No. 2 (a) 1 balloon because:
a. Constant altitude.
b. Slow variation in azimuth.
c. Visual observation about the same time at the same altitude by a group of officers.
d. Motive as to the cause for search for that balloon was established as an order from the Commanding Officer of the student attachment.
e. Pip size checks with balloons.

3. Target echoes as described bear the characteristics which closely resemble aircraft. It is based on what we have now. We can't add anything negative. Although it resembles an aircraft, it is not impossible that it is caused by weather phenomena. It is of bleak waves.

4. Weather possibility exists as follows:
a. Stationary target when first detected giving rapid altitude change offers us one solution that fits.
b. It is to be qualified, however, that weather is not as plausible an explanation of a track of 10,000 yds. continuously at 700/mph over south to 32,000 yds. range. It is to be mentioned however, that more accurate experienced observations than those of the students would be required to identify any points of similarity in the actual appearance of aircraft return.

Students were able to yield primarily only information concerning the motions of the pip. However, as most preliminary conclusions offered this staff, the airborne sighting of 1st Lt Rogers and Major Ballard follows:

There are counter-indications that it is an attempt by these two officers to gain publicity in that transmission by the pilot to Sansworth were monitored by Twin lights and it was definitely reported by the monitor that the pilots were excited in describing something which they believed to exist from the sound of their voices. A ground track was established by reference to interrogation a chart made airborne by Lt Rogers. It is believed that the ground chart which he recorded on that map is correct as the pilots consider it. No statement was made as to whether the pilots are correct but only as they consider it. The range involved cross-section by observation from greater altitude against geographic points on the ground. Upper limited range could thereby be established. A size was reported 30 to 50 ft. in diameter is not a fixed or reliable value. Lt Rogers will admit a larger size even up to 3-17 dimensions. As to speed, Rogers and Ballard would not fix a value. They quote only their ground track against the sighting time that is 30 to 50 nautical miles in about two minutes. This shape oblates spheroid the color silver. There were no more observations which we could offer the staff. At the time of this recording, conclusions are something as follows: From the interrogation of Lt Rogers, the E-33 pilot, (a) the subject was circular in shape changing after banking to elliptical. Conclusion: Oblique spheroid in shape the object bank in turning. (b) The object was silver in color. Pilot was firm that the object did not reflect the sunlight brightly. (c) The object covered 35 to 50 miles during a two minute period of observation. Conclusion: That with an allowance for misinterpretation, the object makes good speeds greater than 700/mph. (d) The object cannot be fixed for size except within the lower

bound of 35 ft diameter and upper bound of B-17 diameter. (e) The time of sighting was 11:35 EDT and the object was lost at 11:37 EDT, on 10 September 1951. However, all the foregoing observations concerning the conclusions from the interrogation of Lt Rogers are in the assumption that it is impossible to demonstrate this criteria necessary to establish their sighting as one of a balloon. Now these criteria are considered to be something like the following:

a. Opportunity - that is the presence of a balloon in that geographic area.

b. Similarity - that is points of similarity between balloons and observations made.

c. Absence of a negative component - that is, the pilots themselves verified as a balloon or the subjects who were viewing from the ground did not see a balloon or did see a balloon. However, this could be elaborated upon.

It is believed that essentially that these factors would effect the decision.

Now as to opportunity, we have information that the Evans Signal Laboratory released two balloons at 11-12 EDT 10 September, that these balloons were in the air until 12:32 EDT on 10 September and that they burst at 104,000 ft and the diameter of the balloons at burst were 39 ft approximately. It is to be noticed that Evans Signal Laboratory is located at Belmar, N. J. It is considered that opportunity is presented in the time element and in geographic locations regarding points of similarity the following must be considered:

Considering that the pilots disagreed radically, interrogations of A-2 of the EADF and interrogations by ATIC personnel as in their written statements concerning ground tract that they are not sure or more than this fact that the

object was always on their left and that they did not or did assume a parallel heading. Mathematically speaking, this is to say that the object was going in the same direction as the T-33 aircraft was turning and that the object is following a course such that it is always leading the aircraft, that is, out of phase with it, or that the object is traveling in phase inside the circle of the aircraft and indeed that it may even be stationary inside the circle of the aircraft.

It is to be noted that the interpretation that the object always lay on the left of the pilot may be that the object was a balloon stationary inside their turning circle. It is also to be noted that the pilots are not sufficiently sure of the ground track to negate this and a calculation concerning what the altitude of a balloon must be are unnecessary and impossible in that the accuracy of the pilot's report is an extremely questionable thing. In fact, there is indication that they cannot fix the alleged ground track of the object within 10 nautical miles. Note that in terms of speed, this means ten nautical miles in two minutes or five nautical miles per minute or 300 knots per hour if one takes the extreme error between the two observations of ground track. A point of similarity is that balloons are silvery painted for radar purposes when released from Evans Signal Laboratory. So recon was reported by the pilot. A point of similarity is the shape viewed under proper circumstances that the balloon might have an oblique spheroidal shape. In the light of this information, it is considered that there is a strong possibility that the sighting was that of a balloon. However, if it can be disproved without recourse to metaphysics that the object was not a balloon, then it should be considered that the four conclusions previously are essentially those which we can stand firmly upon.

20 Sept., 1951

Following is a transcript of an interrogation of Lt. Wilbert S. Rogers and Maj. Dana NIL Ballard Jr., of the 148th Flr Interceptor Sq., of Dover, Delaware. The interrogation was a conf placed by Lt. Col. W. A. Rosengarten at Ft. Mc Henry, Cummings, 125th Field Activities Group, Air Technical Intelligence Command.

The subject matter relates to the sighting of an unidentified aircraft which the subject officers observed on 16 Sept. 1951, while airborne near Sandy Hook, N.J.

Although these men had been previously interrogated by the Air Defense Command (Col. De Maurier) on 12 Nov. 1951, the information which was available from this report was not sufficient in coverage to establish the facts of the matter, particularly in regard to the means whereby the information became available to the public. This question was at large when the Fort Monmouth radar school received several telephone calls concerning the incident.

The interrogation follows:

1. The object was first sighted over Sandy Hook, and the information available to the interrogators was verified as true and complete by the subjects.

2. The conclusion of communication of the information as examined as follows:

a. Between 1135 and 1157 16 September, 1951, Sergeant (CPCS) became aware of the existence of a fast flying object when initially the information was that an unidentified object was flying by? Pilot Rogers to Maj. Ballard was transmitted over a radio check-in. It is certain that Sgt. Monmouth heard that there was an unidentified object making 7-800 because at this time Sgt. Monmouth queried "What was that?"

At this time Pilot Rogers described, giving heading of 1200 and an invariably invariable geographic "fix" on Sandy Hook, instead of Point Pleasant. It is believed that Lt. Carr was on 301 and say I was acknowledged although this is not certain.

Invariably after locating the object, the "F-3 Meagan" being on 301 and to Mitchel, entered into traffic pattern alone, and landed immediately. The two officers agree on landing time as 1147 EST.

3. The question of nonselective communication of this information was raised. Specifically, whether the information could have been released by those who were placed to overhear their conversations, etc.

4. The driver of a carryall in 7 have heard from the two men that they saw a road object at very high speed while no warning was given from the ATC to operations on landing. The name of the driver is not known, nor is it known that he could hear their conversation over the truck noise.

5. The officers did not render a report of the sighting to the operations officer at Mitchell, nor did they receive a debriefing since this was a local flight in X.I.

c. The officers advised Col Sprowls and Col Spain, operations and training officers on General Winnie's staff that they had seen a very high speed unidentified aircraft and were making observations concerning such action. "Their only response was laughter." Time 1200, approximately, 16 Sept 1951.

d. Since Maj Ballard returned to De Ver, Lt Rogers, while at Mitchell, spoke with a man identifying himself as Major Barron, public information officer. He/what it was that the subject saw. Lt. Rogers related location, ground track, description, time of sighting, duration of sighting, and color.

Maj Barron allegedly did no inquiry himself except as PIO. He then stated that this sounded like good newspaper material and that he was sending a newspaper man (newspaper name forgotten) over to operations to get the story from Lt. Rogers. He is further said to have advised Lt. Rogers that he was personally clearing this information for release. Maj Barron did not provide a means of identifying or establishing the individual who was to come to see Lt. Rogers. Then Maj Barron asked how long Lt. Rogers would be at Mitchell and was told some hours.

About half an hour after the telephone call from Maj Barron, a man in civilian clothes (description not recalled) appeared and asked the operator and clerk for Lt. Rogers. Lt. Rogers was but pulled out and found that the telephone of the base security officer was due to subsequent events.

The civilian introduced himself as a newspaper man, gave his civilian number, and asked that Maj Barron send him to get a story. He asked that Lt. Rogers inform the man that he must call Maj Barron to get a report on his clearance. This the said (sic) failing to locate it at the PIO office, but succeeding at the officer's mess. The conversation between the civilian and Lt. Rogers on the other end of the line, and the civilian Lt. Rogers, was all right, that he was cleared to receive the information on the authority of Maj Barron.

Lt. Rogers took the civilian to the operations map, and showed the geographic location of the sighting, the track, the elapsed time, the color, shape. They went from the operations map to a sectional-air map. The civilian asked for further explanation due to large scale. Lt. Rogers told him what he thought he had seen, and was told that it was an object which Lt. Rogers had never seen before.

Lt. Rogers detailed to his CO what transpired when the civilian asked further explanation due to large scale. The civilian stated that the weather balloons cannot travel so fast as the object sighted.

At this point an unidentified civilian, carrying a 45 Spec drape, w/ flash gun and with lens and bellows open approached and stated that he wanted a picture of Lt Rogers in front of the operations map. Lt Rogers stated that the two men behaved as Lt. Rogers here working together, but they exchanged no greeting and names were not used to his recollection. Then
