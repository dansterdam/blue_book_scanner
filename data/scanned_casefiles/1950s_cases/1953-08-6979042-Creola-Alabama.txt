Details: At approximately 1900 CST, 26 August 1953, the USAF Intelligence Officer was notified by the USAF Intelligence Officer of the report of five separate unidentified flying objects observed by [redacted]. The dates of the sightings were from 21 July 1953 through 17 August 1953, inclusive.

The Intelligence Officer of the 17024 ATC conducted an investigation and obtained the following statements from the observers:

On 21 July 1953 at approximately 2000-2030 hours local time, [redacted] on his way home from Creola heading North on Highway 13, was at his try home from Creola, heading North on Highway 13, when a bright light was observed in the field of vision through the windshield of his vehicle from the Southwest, crossed the highway, and disappeared to the Northeast. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and at a fairly high altitude. The object glowed a bright reddish-orange color and duration of sighting was for only a few seconds. No sounds were associated with the glow and did not appear to resemble a meteor or a shooting star. The location of the observation was Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 56 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 31 minutes West.

On 1 August 1953 at 2020 hours local time, [redacted] was getting into her vehicle when she sighted the flying object. This object was on the west side of her car, approximately 100-150 yards away. The object was round and glowed. She could not estimate the altitude other than stating that it was at a fairly high altitude and that the object was not too far away from her. The leading part was a dull amber color in the center part. Light did not resemble a meteor or a shooting star and no sound was associated with the light. Duration of the sighting could not be determined. Location of the observation at the time of the sighting was in Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 56 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 02 minutes West. Visibility 3-2.

On 2 August 1953 at 0920 hours local time, [redacted], Methodist preacher, was on his way home from Creola to Citronelle, Alabama when he sighted the flying object. It glowed and gave off a glow on the leading edge which appeared to be a brilliant white. The object was large and gave the appearance blurred and tapered toward the rear. The object was large, on the west side, at a high altitude. Subject stated that he could not estimate altitude so he guessed that it was 5-6000 feet high. It appeared to be solidly large in size with no seams noticeable. Speed was estimated to be much faster than the jet aircraft in this area. Individual stated he has knowledge of meteorology and that the object was either a vapor trail or a shooting star. Observer did not see any formation of aircraft at the time of the sighting. Location of the observation was in Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 56 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 02 minutes West.

On 3 August 1953 at 1730-2700 hours local time, [redacted]...

STATEMENT OF
CREOLA, ALABAMA

On 1 August 1953 at 20:30 PM local time, I was just gettin into my vehicle when I saw the object in the sky. It was on the West side of Hwy 43 heading in a SW direction. I could not make out shape or size and the only thing that I could notice was the variation in the color of the lights. It appeared to be glowing a reddish color in the leading part of the object and a dull amber glow in the rear part.

I was traveling a very high rate of speed and the duration of the sighting could not have lasted two seconds before it disappeared to the SW. I could not approximate the altitude although what I did see of the object was fairly large in size. There was no routine associated with the light and I did not see or hear any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. It appeared to be going in a straight and level flight.

It appeared as a bright reddish glow loading from the North to the South and parallel to Army 45, on the East side. Object was traveling at a high rate of speed on at a 45 degree angle. Both observers agreed that this object far exceeded the speed of jet aircraft they had seen in this area. Duration of the sighting lasted for approximately three seconds. Neither of the observers saw or heard any aircraft in the area at the time of sighting. There was no indication what this object was or did it appear to be a meteor or a star.
