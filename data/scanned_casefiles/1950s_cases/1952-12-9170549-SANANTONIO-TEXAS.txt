LOCAL: 29/00159

LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 7 Yes

SOURCE: City Male

OBJECTS: One

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Green bell-shaped object traveled at a high rate of speed in a slightly downward course, then took a further downward dip and disappeared. Elevation of object when first sighted was 15° above the horizon. Estimated speed of object was faster than a jet a/c and slower than a meteor. Reliability of source is unknown.

CONCLUSIONS:
- Was Balloon
- Probably Balloon

STATEMENT

TIME: 1815 hours, 21 Dec 1952
LOCATION: Pecos-Tilden Highway approximately one mile South of the seven Sisters Road intersection, San Antonio, Texas
DIRECTION: Object was traveling in a South Eastern Direction

I was driving my car on a heading of approximately 0 degrees. Suddenly, a male green light appeared in the sky at about one o'clock. It was much the same appearance as a "ball from a Bunsen burner". It was at an elevation of about 15 degrees above the horizon and traveled very rapidly to a two o'clock position on a slightly downward course. The velocity of the object seemed remarkable. Slower than a meteor but faster than any jet aircraft which I have observed.

The intensity of the object's light seemed to vary, for after an interval which I would estimate to be one to one and a half seconds, as the object was moving in the downward course, it took a further downward trend, seemingly losing velocity and light, and disappeared from view. The object appeared to be about 10 degrees above the horizon when it disappeared.

At the time the above took place I was alone, however, one car was stopped on a South heading about 250 yards South of the Seven Sisters intersection, and another car's headlights on the Seven Sisters Highway was observed. It is possible that occupants of these cars observed this phenomena.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

(Circle One): Yes or No

29.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too?
(Circle One): Yes or No

29.2 Please list their names and addresses:

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size if necessary.

All the observable facts of the sighting of this phenomenon were included in my signed statement.

I believe that I am a fairly qualified observer due, first, to my engineering experience and, second, to my experiences as an Air Force pilot of the Eighth AF in Europe from Feb. '43 to July '44.

It is my considered opinion that this object was not, in nature, so-called "shooting stars", nor did the slight amounts form an aircraft.

It is further my opinion that this questionnaire is poorly executed. For example: No. 19 leaves would be applicable in a limited number of cases. No. 19 leaves much to be desired in determining the actual size of the object. No. 20 also gives measurements tied up to archiving - should the "questionnaire" of No. 19 be in error, No. 20 has no significance.

I. Description of Incident
One round, unidentified object of undetermined size, that emitted an intense green light was observed and reported by a civilian man while driving in his car in San Antonio. Time of sighting was 1815 hrs., CST, for a few seconds only. Object looked like a "Roman Candle" and faded just before disappearing.

II. Discussion of Incident
This can be written off with quite a bit of assurance as simply a common meteor. It has all the characteristics, including a short time in sight and faded out just before disappearing.

III. Conclusion
Probably meteor.

Gentlemen, Sir,

I am a student and I am very much interested in special questions.
at the present time I am not log up on a subject that is quite debatable-
do flying saucers exist or not?

I read an article in a French magazine which stated that on the 22nd
of December, 1952, a technician of the United States Air Force saw in the
sky a luminous object (report 7 to be forwarded later).

Could you get hold of it and within the scope of your possibilities
let me have some data on the subject?

Awaiting your answer I extend you my regards

(Beg)

My first impression was that it was a taillight of an airplane. Since it was in the plane of an airplane taking off toward me I discounted the taillight idea. Stopped my car while still keeping the object in sight. Got out of the car and heard no sound at any kind. Suddenly the object whipped straight up toward the zenith showing its bottom side which was a deep orange red. It shot upward in pulses from right to left at about 45 degrees from vertical. Such line it accelerated faster. Suddenly it streaked across the sky toward the south at about an angle of 50 degrees with its white side toward me the major portion of the time. Three times it reached through a plane which showed its reddish under side. A point about midway through this roll showed no light. It finally took up a position to the south of the plane Jupiter and stopped at an altitude which I estimate at 100 degrees. All this happened in 5 minutes. At this position it would dart forward each time in an alternate direction, Left or Right. I watched until 7:45 P.M. or a total of 15 minutes later.

Note: I walked across the highway to a gas station and called the attendant's attention to the object. This was 5 minutes after the object reached its zenith and stopped. He confirmed its movement. Do not know attendant's name or type of gas sold in his station.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

In compliance with AF Ltr 220-5, dated 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) Object was believed to be a bird, something like an 11 ft. from "Eggers" Drafting, could not be determined. Appeared to be visible intermittent. Site and configuration of object not clearly determined. Object was hovering, no forward motion was observed. No normal behavior of wind was there. Observation was made from a point less than a hectare. Object was first observed in one position, and then appeared to move to a new position in a few seconds. Observation about 10 minutes above the horizon on a clear day. "Vicinity of" Lackland AFB was last or object last before it disappeared.

(2) Object was sighted 1415 hours, 637, 21 Dec 1952, and was observed for only a few brief periods.

(3) A visual surface observation without electronic or optical equipment was made.

(4) Observer was an Airman-Enlisted Airman, apparently with Air Force South of San Antonio, Texas.

(5) Object was observed by [REDACTED]. Well Air Force pilot, stationed at Lackland, in all operational type aircraft. He is presently employed as a staff officer for Kelly Air Force Base.

(6) Fair clear weather prevailed at the time of the sighting.

(7) No activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise is known to have existed which may have accounted for the sighting.

(8) No physical evidence of the sighting exists.

(9) No interception or identification action taken.

(10) Location of air activity in the general area at the time of the sighting is unknown.

NARRATIVE

TIME:    1:15 hours, 21 Dec 1952
LOCATION: Pecan-Hides (Highway approximately one mile South
           of the Seven Sisters Road intersection San Antonio, Texas)
DIRECTION: Object was drifting in South Eastern Direction

I was driving my car on a heading of approximately 7 degrees. Suddenly, at 1:15 p.m. I noticed an object in the sky at about one o'clock. It had much the same appearance as a "ball from Anzio candle". It was in an elevation of about 15 degrees above the horizon and traveled very rapidly. To a good watch location all sky coverage was possible. The velocity of the object seemed considerably slower than a meteor but faster than any jet aircraft which I have observed.

The intensity of the object's light seemed to vary, for after an interval which I would estimate to be one to one and a half seconds, the object was moving in a constant course. Its downward trend, gradually losing velocity and light, and then curved from view. The object appeared to be about 10 degrees above the horizon when it disappeared.

At the time the above took place I was alone, however, one car was stopped on a South heading about 250 yards South of the Seven Sisters Highway was observed. It is possible that occupants of those cars observed the phenomenon.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
