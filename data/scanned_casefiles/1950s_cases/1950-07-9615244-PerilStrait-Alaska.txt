Flying Saucers
Seen in Sky Here

A number of Clinton county residents saw a phenomenon in the western sky Monday between 9:30 and 10 P.M. which they described as appearing to be flying saucers.

Visitors: Haroum, of Route 74, west of Wilmington; Mrs. C. A. Henry, Louise street; Mrs. Glenn Curtis, West Locust street, and Mrs. Roy Henry, of Bennett road, all told the News-Journal they had witnessed the shooting lights in the sky.

Mrs. Roy Henry said they looked exactly like those they saw a year ago between 11 P.M. and 12 midnight, except for the one stationary light spot which Haroum and Mrs. C. A. Henry also saw.

Haroum described the lights as not very high above or across, which flitted across the sky. He said one of them went from north to the west, seemed to turn back toward the north for a short distance and then stopped, remaining stationary, while other lights flashed across heavens this one.

Mrs. Roy Henry said while lights looked like a smoke ring to the left at a high rate of speed. Some of them seemed to be somewhat like a smoke ring.

Mrs. Henry added, Mrs. Glenn Curtis, who was driving into Wilmington on the Xenia road when she noticed the lights, said they seemed to be like a smoke ring across each other, traveling in opposite directions. She did not see the stationary light, however.

There was no distinct appearance, Mrs. Roy Henry said, describing the lights as a kerosene flame.

Other were reports in Clinton and the Associated Press told the News-Journal that Cincinnati meteorologists explained that the lights were caused by a cloud condition which brought about the unusual play of light rays.
