17 September 1958

Dear [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 13 August 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object sighted by your son on 10 August 1958 at Collinsville, Illinois. Your letter contained insufficient data to result in a valid conclusion. However, the color of the object strongly suggests a bolide (or fireball).

For your information I am enclosing latest Department of Defense Fact Sheet dated 5 November 1957 on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

Encl                                                LAWRENCE J. TACKER
