hours. Colonel observed a luminous, greenish-blue colored object
to the northeast, approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. The object
appeared to have serrated contours and was approximately the size of a
baseball. When in an arc of the object appeared to be elliptical or slightly
tear drop in shape. Colonel did not observe any exhaust connected thereto.
The object was moving in a straight line toward the northwest and traversed
approximately 20 degrees of the horizon before it appeared to fade into the
background. Colonel observed the object for two to three seconds before
from two to three seconds before it disappeared. Colonel heard no sound
in connection with the object nor could he estimate the distance away or
speed of travel. Colonel stated that he could recall no correlation at the
time of the sighting, but that he was sure it was after 2000 hours and so he
had been after 2100 hours. Colonel further advised that he thought the
object was a large one, flying toward the ball park in Phoebus, therefore, dismissed
the incident from his mind.

4. On 18 April 1952 Langley Air Force Base Operations advised that
there were no aircraft from Langley AFB flying in the vicinity of Fort
Eustis, Virginia, on the evening of 17 April 1952.

5. On 18 April 1952 the office of the District Intelligence Officer,
5th Naval District, Norfolk, Virginia, advised that subject sighting was
typical of a Navy jet pilot's use of his after burner or a quick work of
speed, but that no Navy aircraft equipped with an after burner were flying
in the vicinity of Ft Eustis on the evening of 17 April 1952.

6. Weather Sequence reports from Langley AFB Base, which is located
fifteen (15) miles southeast of Ft Eustis, for 2030 hours and 2130 hours 17
