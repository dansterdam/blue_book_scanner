10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One round (sometimes irregular) obj the size of a pinhead held at arms length, appeared silvery, white and rosy. At times the object appeared to oscillate and as the sun set the obj appeared to become a rose color. The object remained in the same general position throughout the entire 2 hour sighting. FSD's tried intercept with success due to extreme altitude of object.

11. COMMENTS
Concur with the opinion of the reporting officers that this sighting was caused by a balloon. All facts of the sightings could not better fit a balloon hypothesis. Not only was balloon released, NOTAM area was sent by the Ontario, Calif aprt about a balloon in the area at the time. Check w/ADC 9K revealed that there was also a balloon(origin unknown)plotted 6 of the area few hrs earlier. This balloon drifting toward area of sighting.
