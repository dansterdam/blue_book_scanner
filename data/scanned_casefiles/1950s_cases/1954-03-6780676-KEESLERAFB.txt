NAME: A/C [redacted]
SIGNATURE: [redacted]
DATE: 8 March 1954

At approximately 10:30C 7 March 1954 we took off in a C-45 type aircraft to try to find an unidentified object which had been sighted over Wiggens, Miss.

We flew around the Wiggens area for about 30 minutes without sighting anything unusual when the Control Tower in Brockley Alabama called, telling us there was an unidentified object over Mobile Alabama. We proceeded to Mobile flying at 10,000 feet. About 10 miles West of Mobile we sighted an object high over the city (Mobile). We flew to a point under the object and started to circle. The object was observed for two hours from all angles. During this time it was observed that the object was drifting in an easterly direction at approximately 20 miles per hour. The object was very high, probably about 50,000 feet. We had to look up at an angle of about 80 degrees while observing it.

The object was white and appeared to be translucent. It appeared to be a balloon, and could have been made of rubber or plastic. There was a white streamer hanging from the bottom of the object which appeared to be about 1/5 of the object's diameter long and about 1/10 of the object's diameter wide. I took about 5 pictures of the object with

a Stereoscopic (three dimensional) camera at 1/100 of a second shutter speed and
16, 11, and 8 lens opening. During the two hours we observed the object we watched
it with the naked eye and through 7X50 binoculars.

At about 12:30 a jet type aircraft (F-55) flew up to see if he could
identify the object. He climbed to 40,000 feet and said the object was about 7,000
feet above him or at 17,000 feet. When we observed the object through the binoculars
it appeared to be the size of a pea (in the glass). This was the same size a small
house appeared on the ground through the binoculars. Since we were 10,000 feet from
the ground and approximately 37,000 feet from the object it appears that the object
was three times as big as a small house.

We left the object at approximately 12:30 and went back to our base. At this
time another jet (F-86) was proceeding to the scene to try to get closer to the
object and possibly identify it. When we left the object was still drifting to the
East at approximately 20 miles per hour.

Film from Stereoscopic camera is being forwarded with this report. Film broke once
while taking first picture from plane, which necessitated re-threading the film in
the airplane.
