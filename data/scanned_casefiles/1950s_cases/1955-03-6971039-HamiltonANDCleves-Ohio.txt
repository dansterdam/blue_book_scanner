There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or form with various questions related to the observation of an unidentified object.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension: 2 - 3 feet.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with various questions and answer fields.

According to the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the text in the document:

The object was located inside a building when it was seen.
The object was in the business section of a city.
The witness was doing nothing special at the time they noticed the object. 
The witness was not moving in an automobile or other vehicle.
The object was first seen from true north and was estimated to be 22 degrees from the horizon. 
When the object disappeared, it was from true north and the elevation was unknown.

- page 8 -

The image contains three sketches or illustrations, but no photograph. The first sketch depicts an object above the horizon, and the instructions ask the viewer to imagine how high the object was above the horizon. The second and third sketches show the position of the object when it was first seen and its later position, respectively.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
