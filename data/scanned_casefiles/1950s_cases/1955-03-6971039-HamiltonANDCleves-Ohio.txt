(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repost information that you have already given in the questionnaire, end add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [Redacted]
SIGNATURE: [Redacted]
DATE: May 21, 1955

[Handwritten text, partially legible, appears to describe an observation of lights. The text is somewhat difficult to read in its entirety due to handwriting and image quality.]

The first paragraph seems to describe seeing small lights, something about their movement and behavior.

The second paragraph continues the description, mentioning something about the lights' position and movement.

The third paragraph appears to continue the narrative about the observed lights.

Due to the handwriting and image quality, I cannot confidently transcribe the entire text verbatim without potentially introducing errors.

At the top of the page, I can see:

USAFTIS                                                                Page 2

The handwritten text appears to be:

"It was within 100 yds at about 500 yds height. It was followed on air, but missed on low or the little one. The light was the smaller one, we noticed, no more around."

The text is somewhat difficult to read with complete certainty, but this is my best interpretation of the handwritten text.
