REPLY TO
ATTN OF:    M002

SUBJECT:    Unidentified Flying Object (UFO): Sighted 0200 Hours November or
            December 1959 (Date Unl), at [redacted], Clarkston, Michigan

TO:         Air Technical Intelligence Center
            Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2 the attached file concerning an
unidentified flying object allegedly seen and photographed by Mr.
[redacted] with contents contained herein is submitted.

2. Due to the ambiguities involved concerning the date and time of
the sighting, detailed analysis of this report, at this level, is
extremely difficult; however, the only real time clue found under the
weather and winds section of the report was pursued and revealed the
following information:

    a. The first snowfall for the area concerned was listed as a trace
    only and recorded on 13 November 1959. The weather was clear,
    temperature 27 degrees and winds WSW 4K.

    b. The first snowfall for the year that remained over night was
    recorded on 28 November 1959. The recorded weather at time of
    sighting reads high clouds 2/10 sky coverage, temperature 27 degrees
    and winds NNE 6K. This is the most probable date of the sighting and
    based on this precept the following information was revealed.

    (1) Aircraft of a known type and design are eliminated due to
    the length of time observed.

    (2) The possibility that a weather balloon may have been
    sighted was investigated with results as follows:

        a. The meteorology section located at Flint, Michigan
        Airport station releases two (2) weather balloons daily at 0700
        EST and 1800 EST. These balloons ascend at a rate of 1000 FPM to an
        average altitude of 50,000 feet. The balloons normally expand and
        reach a diameter of thirty (30) feet then burst, however, on 23
        November the balloon did not burst. It reached an altitude of 80,000
        feet and developed a glow leak. At this point the recording run was
        considered complete and discontinued.

        b. The sun set at 1712 EST.

        c. The balloon reached sunlight between 40 and 50
        thousand feet.

d. 90% of all balloons released by the Flint Meteorology Station burst and fall within a five (5) mile radius of Clarkston which is 20.81 ESE of the point of release.

e. The exact ascent azimuth the balloon followed on the date in question is unknown since the records are retained for 60 days only.

3. In view of the foregoing, it is believed that this object was most likely to have been a weather balloon.

There is very little text visible in this image. On the left side of the page, vertically along the margin, there appears to be some text, but it is too small and blurry to read clearly. The only other notable elements are a black oval/circle shape in the top right corner of the page and a thin white/light line running diagonally across the page.
