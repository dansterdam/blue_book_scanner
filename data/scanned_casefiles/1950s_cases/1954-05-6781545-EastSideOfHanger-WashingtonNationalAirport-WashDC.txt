I interviewed these three men later the same day, I understood they had been discussing meteors, "flying saucers" and related objects just prior to the sightings, so they were probably in the proper frame of mind to see something along those lines. However, they are men who have performed this duty before during these hours and are not new to the job. Considering their experience and the fact that these men saw these objects at three different times, I feel a certain amount of reliability must be attached to their sightings.
