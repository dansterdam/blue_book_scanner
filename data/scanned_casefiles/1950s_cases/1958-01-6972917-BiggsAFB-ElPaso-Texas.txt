FOR COMMANDERS. SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
IN ACCORDANCE WITH AFR 200-2 THE FOLLOWING REPORT IS SUBMITTED:
1. OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED ON RADAR BY THE OFFICIALS IN CHARGE
OF THE RAPCON STATION BIGGS AIR FORCE BASE, TEXAS
VISUAL SIGHTINGS WERE ATTEMPTED BUT NONE WERE SUCCESSFUL.

A. NEGATIVE
B. NEGATIVE
C. NEGATIVE
D. EIGHT TO ELEVEN

OF NECESSARY SPECIALIZED INFORMATION IT IS THE OPIONION OF THE
PREPARING OFFICER THAT THESE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS COULD
NOT HAVE BEEN ANY KNOWN AIRBORNE OBJECT, EXCEPT FOR THE SUDDEN
APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE ON THE RADAR SCOPE AND THE FACT
THAT NO AIRCRAFT WERE CLEARED FOR SUCH A FLIGHT BY THE LOCAL CAA
FACILITY, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT THE RADAR RETURNS COULD HAVE
BEEN FROM A FLIGHT OF HELICOPTERS. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY, IS
THAT THE RADAR RETURNS MAY HAVE BEEN FROM A FLIGHT OF DUCKS.
IF SUCH AN EXPLANATION IS POSSIBLE IT APPEARS TO BE A REASONABLE
EXPLANATION. THE RETURNS DISAPPEARED WHILE IN THE VICINITY
OF THE ONLY LAKE IN THE LOCAL AREA. RADAR RETURNS PROVIDED BY
UNUSUAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS APPEARS TO BE A LOGICAL EXPLANATION.
HOWEVER, UNUSUAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE
EXISTED AT THE TIME. NO RADAR SCOPE PHOTOGRAPHY WAS TAKEN.
