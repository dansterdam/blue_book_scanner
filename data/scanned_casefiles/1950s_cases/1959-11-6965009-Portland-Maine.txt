U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may go on to the back of this sheet if necessary. Add any further comments, names, dates, times, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [redacted]
SIGNATURE: [redacted]
DATE: November 6, 1959

The text handwritten on the form states:
"I happened to be looking out of the bay window at the northern horizon where I have a good view of the northern sky. At that moment at approximately 7:05 PM CST, I saw a small spherical object moving at a high rate of speed across the northern horizon. It was definitely round and white in color. It was going at a terrific speed & disappeared into the distance relatively near the horizon. It was in view at most 15-20 seconds. I definitely could not have been merely a satellite or plane. The motion was very erratic & swerved back & forth in the sky. At first I thought it might be a weather balloon or meteorite, but discounted these because the motion was too erratic to be either."

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document page with handwritten text.

Clear without any closed formation, which I can note because this was observed from a distance. It had been moving rather rapidly. A new method of operation that I had not seen before in the sky before as it was something like I have never seen. Most definitely something out of the ordinary.

The image appears to be a diagram or schematic depicting a celestial observation, likely related to a report on unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The diagram shows a 90-degree zenith, with various angular markings, elevations, and azimuth directions labeled. There is a sketch or illustration of a landscape or cityscape visible in the lower portion of the diagram. However, the image does not contain any photographic elements.

Location: Portland, Maine
Date: 11/10/59 Hour (?)  1630
Witness: C. D. S., Observer 
Description: Triangular Object, copper 
color, white-hot interior, no evidence 
of propulsion or stability, disappeared 
rapidly. 
Direction of Motion: S 12 W
Satellite: (AGC-P-33, Phone 692119)
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc):

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Poor
Analysis and Conclusions: THIS CASE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS CASES INVOLVING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS IN SIGHT FOR OVER 5 SECONDS AND SHOWED CHARACTERISTICS OF UNUSUAL PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, IN VIEW OF THE POOR RELIABILITY OF THE OBSERVER, NO DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN.

The text of the letter is as follows:

November 16, 1959
Portland, Maine

Department of the Air Force
Washington, D. C.

Sir,

I wish to report having seen an unidentified flying object on November 13, 1959 about 2:00 p.m. The following is an account of what I saw:

About 2:00 p.m. as I was looking across the sky in a south-north direction, a bright light caught my attention. As I watched it was a weather balloon but soon discounted this as it got closer. It was flying high and had a translucent glow of rapid speed. It had a round ball shape and was white in color. It was not a conventional military or commercial aircraft. It disappeared in the northern sky.

The sky at the time of observation was a clear blue without cloud formations. It was not and could not have been a satellite coming on a path very close to earth.

The above is a factual report as I described it. I am sending this information to you for whatever value it may be to you.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
