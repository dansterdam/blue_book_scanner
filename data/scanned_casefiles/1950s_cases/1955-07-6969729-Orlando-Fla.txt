Textual content from the document:

IN ACTION
15 JUL 1955 07 55285 07 552
REPORTED OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A BRIGHT LIGHT THAT MOVED VERY RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY FROM WEST TO EAST. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE VERY BRIGHT AND DID NOT FOLLOW A STRAIGHT COURSE BUT SEEMED TO WOBBLE OR "WEAVE" SLIGHTLY AS IT TRAVELED.
THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY THE REPORTER AND HIS WIFE FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES. THEY WERE IN THE BACKYARD OF THEIR HOME IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA, AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION.
WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE CLEAR AND THE SKY WAS DARK. ONLY THE VERY FAINT OUTLINE OF SOME CLOUDS COULD BE SEEN.
THE OBJECT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE LARGER THAN A STAR OR PLANET WHEN FIRST SIGHTED. IT TRAVELED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND WAS ONLY VISIBLE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.
THE REPORTER CLAIMS THAT OBJECTS OF THIS TYPE HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN THE ORLANDO AREA ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BUT THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINCT SIGHTINGS HE HAS EVER MADE.
