AF FORM 112-PART I
UNCLASSIFIED

Country: Germany

Subject: Unusual Object Sighted in Sky near Neubiburg Air Base

Date of Information: 14 November 1951
Date of Incident: 11 October 1951

Prepared by: Capt. GERALD M. JONES, USAF
Forwarded by: Capt. Robert L. Rice, USAF
                Carl E. Lucas, T/Sgt., USAF

Evaluation: Documentory

1. At 0455 hours on 11 October 1951, two enlisted men of the 385th Bomber Squadron stationed at Neubiburg Air Base, Neubiburg, Germany observed a strange looking object in the sky over Neubiburg Air Base. Forwarded herewith and #2 are the statements of Sgt. Robert L. Moe and T/Sgt. Carl E. Lucas which describe the sighting. From their description the object appeared to be some form of a flying "disk". Its altitude was estimated to be about 20,000 feet.

2. A check was made with the weather detachment and flight operations to determine whether there might be some explanation. There were no weather balloons known to be in the sky. Ore C-47 detached from Neubiburg Air Base at 0355 hours, but the two airmen insisted the observation was earlier than 0355 hours and that the object was not a C-47.

3. From time to time this office receives information similar to that presented in this report. It is requested that the Analysis Division of the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Dayton, Ohio, advise this office whether to continue to send back reports of this nature.

APPROVED:

STATEMENT OF ROBERT L. VICE

At 0845 hours local, 11 October 1951, I was standing in front-of-525th hangar at Neubiberg Air Base, AFO 65, when an object catching-the sun's reflection attracted my attention to the sky. In a direction Southwest of the Air Base, First, I believed it to be a blimp or dirigible at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. I continued this altitude because of a layer of Cirrus clouds apparently below the object. However, since the object seemed to remain in one spot or moved at an imperceptible speed, I fixed my attention and I concluded that it wasn't anything I recognized. It reflected light all over except for a triangular dark area.

It looked so odd that I called T/Sgt. Carl E. Lucas from the hangar-and asked him to come look and tell me what he thought. He looked at it and said "Damned if I know what it is, you keep your eye on it and I'll go get Sgt. Warnke." In then left and within ten (10) seconds after he left it disappeared while my eyes were still on it. It was just like a light went out. This is as it looked to me:

STATEMENT OF CARL E. LUCAS

At 0845 on 11 October 1951, Sergeant Robert L. Vice called me from the hangar to observe an object in the sky. He waved his hand toward the Southwest and I instantly saw the object.

It was in the Southwest and looked like an ellipse with a dark triangular section at the portion which seemed to be the rear underpart. It glowed with a shimmering light like reflected sunlight. It seemed to be in two parts like:

I looked for about thirty (30) odd seconds and immediately left to get someone else. I did not see it again.
