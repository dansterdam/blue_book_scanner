USABILITY OF REPORT: EXCELLENT
SPECIFIC: UNKNOWN
USAGE: UNKNOWN
COMMENTS: (Keep the Intelligence Collection informed)

While participating in Eighth Air Force Operations Order 23-54, a B-36H type aircraft was enroute from Nouasseur Air Base, French Morocco, to Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, via the Azores Islands and Bermuda Islands. Aircraft 9179 was skimming the top of a thunderstorm air mass at 15,000 feet on a true heading of 2559 at a true air speed of 171K. The area is approximately 670 NM NNW of Lajes Airfield, Azores Islands. The time was 040142Z about 2200 hours 3 July 1954 local area time. Captain Spahn, the Radar Observer, was engaged in a radar weather search when suddenly he spotted this unusual return on his scope about 20 NM ahead of the aircraft and 15 NM right of course. His APS-23 Radar Set, a component of the K-system, had the antenna set at 45° tilt with the beam pattern adjusted for 40,000 feet. This arrangement normally gives very little ground or sea return. Captain Spahn reset antenna tilt to 0° and gave a closer inspection to the unusual return pattern and rechecked his set. At this point, he turned his O-15 scope camera on (Frame number 6509). After observing the scope for about two or three minutes, he asked his navigator to take a look. About five minutes after the first sighting, he called the aircraft commander and reported what he saw. The aircraft commander did not think the sighting was of importance and dismissed the matter. Captain Spahn continued his inspection of the returns by varying his gain, video, and antenna tilt. At +10° antenna tilt, the objects faded, but not completely. This action was noted by the Intelligence Section, 11th Bomb Wing, H Carswell Air Force Base, Ft Worth, Texas

would tend to confirm his opinion that the objects were on or near the surface. He
switched to sector scan to obtain a larger scale presentation (frame number 6565).
After watching the returns for fourteen minutes and observing no apparent motion,
Captain Spann stopped taking pictures. However, he continued to watch the objects
for another five minutes until they were out of radar range. The position of the
unusual returns were fixed by celestial plot at 35°33'N 40°25'W. The navigator
terminated his celestial navigation leg of 1250 NM at Kindley Air Force Base,
Bermuda, with a circular error of 13 NM.

There was scattered thunderstorm activity in the area. Visibility was
unlimited except for 6/8 undercast. The forecast wind was 245°/15K at 15,000 feet.

RADAR OBSERVER'S COMMENT: Captain Charles C. Spahn, A02072394, MBR on crew
S-63, 98th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy, 11th Bombardment Wing, Heavy. Eleven years
Air Force service, 3,400 flying hours, 1,500 hours as a radar observer. Quote "I've
seen ships on the scope before. In fact I was tracking one a couple of hours before
these things showed up. I'm sure it wasn't interference, and because of the odd
pattern, I don't think it was a cloud return." End quote.

Interpreter, Headquarters 11th Bombardment Wing, Heavy. Sixteen years Air Force service, ten years experience as a Radar-Photo Interpreter, seven years as a Bombardier with 400 hours as a radar operator. Approximately three hours prior to Captain Spahn's sighting, a five aircraft cell of B-36 aircraft passed within 40 NM of the reported sighting and saw nothing. Two of these five aircraft were doing radar weather search. I have conducted typhoon radar reconnaissance both as a radar observer and photo interpreter and have had extensive experience in analyzing unusual scope returns. However, until now I have not observed a return such as presented here. Sometimes interference presents unexplainable patterns, likewise ice crystals in clouds. This persistent number one return is of the same type as presented by a radar reflector target such as target 36 at Eglin Air Force Base Bombing Range. The symmetry of the seven individual returns and the stability of the pattern over an extended time period and azimuth change would indicate a good radar reflective substance, and eliminate the possibility of a saturated cloud formation.

The shape of the individual returns are not common to ships. However, it does resemble a World War II convoy pattern. DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS

The outside diameter of the circle is approximately five nautical miles, using the 10 NM range markers as a base. The size of the individual returns is difficult to determine because a metallic object 20 feet to 200 feet in diameter would give

more accurate data as to size, shape and separation of the returns. The enclosed
