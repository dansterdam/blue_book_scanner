DISTRIBUTION: "G" (ALL CONCERNED)
While participating in search air force operations over the Atlantic Ocean on 3 July 1954, a USAF B-29 aircraft was sighted from Ramey Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, via the Azores Islands and Bermuda Islands. Aircraft 9179 was climbing the top of a 5,000-foot rain shower air mass at 15,000 feet on a true heading of 359 degrees at an average air speed of 17 knots. The aircraft passed about 17,670 ft west of Lajes Airfield, Azores Islands. The time was 0401422 about 2200 hours 3 July 1954 local area time. Captain Spain, the Radar Observer, was engaged in a radar weather search when suddenly he sighted this unusual radar return on his APS-23 Radar Set, a component of the K-system. His APS-23 Radar Set, a component of the K-system, had the antenna set at 4500 tilt with the beam pattern adjusted for 40,000 feet. His radar determination normally gives very little or no return. Captain Spain reset antenna tilt to 00 and gave a closer inspection to the unusual return pattern and rehecked his set. At this point, he turned his Q-15 scope camera on (engine running 50) After observing the return, 1:02 of three minutes, he asked his navigator to take a look. About five minutes after the first sighting, he called the aircraft commander and reported what he saw. The aircraft commander did not think the sighting was of importance and dismissed the matter. Captain Spain made a landing motion of the return, gave a video and antenna tilt. At 2100 antenna tilt, the objects faded, but not completely. This action intelligence Section, 11th Bomb Wing, 9 July 1954.

COMMENTS: Captain Charles C. Sedam of s-83, 96th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy, 11th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, devised his celestial navigation techniques of 1/400 flying hours as a radar observer. Those techniques enabled him to track objects which were as small as a quarter inch on the radar scope before. In fact I was tracking one a couple of hours before these things showed up... I'm sure it wasn't interference, and because of the old Bk-61 and certain modifications I don't think it was a cloud refraction. Send Evaluation.

INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS SECTION
USABILITY OF REPORT:
CREDIBLE PROBABLE TRUE
SPECIFIC UNKNOWN
USAGE: INFORMATION OF REPORT REQUIREMENT

This interpreter, Headquarters 11th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, Sixteenth years Air Force Service, ten years experience as a Radar-Photo Interpreter, seven years as a Bombing Range Director, and other duties in Radar Operations. On 8 July 1954 Captain Spahn's sighting, a five aircraft cell of B-36 aircraft passed within 40 NM of the reported sighting and saw nothing. Two of these five aircraft were doing radar weather search. We have conducted typhoon radar reconnaissance both as a photo-interperter and photo interpreter and have not observed any unusual scope returns. However, until now I have not observed a return such as presented here. Sometimes interference presents unexplainable patterns, likewise the detected signals showed. This persistent number is of the same type as presented by a radar reflector target such as target 35 at Eglin Air Force Base Bombing Range. The symmetry of the seven individual returns and the stability of the target over the minutes would indicate a good radar-reflective substance and eliminate the possibility of a saturated cloud formation. The shape of the individual returns are not common to clouds. However, it does resemble in general pattern cover echo returns on the scope.

The outside diameter of the circle is approximately 150 nautical miles, using the 10 NM range markers as a base. The size of the individual returns is difficult to determine because a metallic object 20 feet to 200 feet in diameter would give the same scope return.
