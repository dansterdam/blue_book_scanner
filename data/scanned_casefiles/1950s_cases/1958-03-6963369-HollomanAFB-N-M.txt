[Handwritten note at bottom of page, partially illegible]

All of this above is characteristic of a balloon. However, the local weather station indicates there was no balloon in area at the time, this was the only thing it could be, and would have had to be launched in the local area for how Carlson follow the low overcast, if the same weather prevailed at Holloman, as at El Paso, Texas.
