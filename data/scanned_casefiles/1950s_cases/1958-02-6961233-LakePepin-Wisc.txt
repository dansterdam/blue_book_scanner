1. Reference message this headquarters OTN 6, 28 February 1958, and your message, Unclas. ACTIN-4845-1001-3, 21 May 1958, in regard to completed action on UFO sighting of 23 February 1958 at Lake Pepin, Wisconsin.

2. The UFO report in question was submitted under provisions of AFR 200-2, 12 August 1954, and Detachment 7, 1006th AISS Squadron was contacted immediately. After message OTN 6 was submitted, however, this headquarters was informed by the AISS that any physical investigation would be be tactical by headquarters, 1006th AISS. Headquarters CADF was informed of this, while this organization at its own expense and with its own transportation went to Lake Pepin and investigated all leads on the spot. Also all other collateral sources were checked. Details are contained in the 315t ADN "Preliminary Investigation or UFO Report", copy attached as Incl. 1.

3. After we had analyzed all reports our conclusions were:

a. That [redacted], ill at the time and the only individual who actually claimed to have seen impact of an object on Lake Pepin, was not completely reliable as an informant.

b. The game warden and commercial fishermen at Lake Pepin could not find any object on the Lake ice or a hole made by an object.

c. Lake Pepin was covered with thick ice and snow which made recovery operations unfeasible.

d. All other witness reports indicated that no object, probably a meteor, fell at approximately the same time, to the NW of Minneapolis, exact location unknown.

Lt. Col. R. Schumacher
Capt. Walter C. Neumann
T/Sgt Jack Manley

On the 27th of February, OIN, 31st Air Division (Defense), received a report from the Division Controller turned in from a [redacted] Minneapolis, Minnesota. This report was 5 days old. Never-the-less, after obtaining information contained in attachment #1 (UFOB Report), a call was placed to CADF, Lt. Col. Kelly, CADF Intelligence, called back and requested a followup investigation. The following names reported as having information bearing on this report were checked out:

Mr. [redacted] Mpls, Minn. (Eye witness to impact) Telephone [redacted] Age - 65 Salesman

Mr. [redacted] Mpls, Minn. Student U of Minn. Telephone [redacted] Age - 25

Mrs. [redacted] White Bear, Minn. Housewife Telephone [redacted]

Mrs. [redacted] Mpls, Minn. Housewife Telephone [redacted]

Further checking and investigation called for a check of the point of impact at Lake Pepin, Wisconsin, and any possible witnesses living in that area. Report of this trip, along with further investigation of the above-named people follows:

Departed St. Paul at 0730, 1 March 58. Arrived at Red Wing, Minnesota and talked to the Desk Sgt. He stated that no reports of objects had

Rept of Prelim Investigation of UFO3 Rept (Cont'd)

been made in regard to an object being seen on 22 February at 2000 hours.

The next stop was Frontenac, Minnesota. There was only one cafe located in that town. The owner stated that to his knowledge no one had mentioned seeing an object during the evening of 22 February 1958. The next stop was made at the Police Station at Lake City, Minnesota. Time was 0945.

The Police Chief stated that he had heard nothing until the morning of 1 March 1958 when a Mr. [redacted] called him from long distance and informed him to collect any information available as there would be people from the Air Force checking on the report. He then (the Police Chief), called the sheriff of Wabasha, Minnesota, and made inquiries as to any reports being received there. Answer was negative.

The Lake City Police Chief then called the Game Warden for Lake Pepin and made the same inquiries. Game Warden's answer was negative.

Lt. Col. Schumacher and myself then proceeded to Maiden Rock, Wisconsin, where we made inquiries of the cafe owner and [redacted]. In both cases Mr. [redacted] had called and made the incident known to these individuals. This was the only report they had of the incident. Our next stop was Stockholm, Wisconsin where we made inquiries at [redacted]. She stated that Mr. [redacted] had stopped in there, had two brandys and after approximately one hour had departed for home. She further stated that Mr. [redacted] had mentioned that he was feeling ill and would not be able to stop and see her husband at Maiden Rock, Wisconsin. Also, that she had known Mr. [redacted] for approximately 20 years. Time was now 1300. Her last statement

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Rept of Prelim Investigation of UFOB Rept (Cont'd)

was, "Mr. _______ called me about 2330, 22 February on long distance and told me he had seen an object fall into the lake." He believed that she should know in order to warn people who might be diving on the lake.

It was bothering him and he was unable to get to sleep. Outside of this statement she knew of no other information and had heard nothing further of any eye witness accounts. She made a trip along the highway the next day, but saw nothing.

We next proceeded back to Maiden Rock and had lunch. Upon questioning several of the local residents at this point, we again received negative answers. After lunch, at 1430 we proceeded to Red Wing and stopped at the radio station _______ where we questioned the news broadcaster. He had heard nothing and had made no releases on this subject. Departure was made from this area. Upon arrival back at St. Paul, Capt Neumann had a call from the 31st ADIv Controller, who stated that a patrolman, Harry G. Roberts, telephone 2341, Frontenac, Minnesota, had a list of witnesses who had seen this object. A call was placed to Mr. Roberts. His report follows:

"I checked all persons in this area and found no one who had actual knowledge. I was in touch with the Game Warden at Wabasha, Minnesota, and he stated that he had been over the lake in the Maiden Rock and Stockholm, Wisconsin, area the 26th of February and had found no holes of unexplained origin." This call came through on 1 March 1958 at 1735 hours.

Meanwhile, calls were placed to a Mrs. _______ and Mr. _______ Reports follow: Time, 1800, 1 Mar 58,

Mr. age 23, student at the University of Minnesota, telephone St. Paul, Minnesota:

"I was standing on the corner of 15th Ave. SE and 4th St. when I saw what appeared to be a meteorite in the NW. It appeared to be falling straight down on 15 degrees from a 90 degree angle. There appeared to be what looked like pieces falling or braking off. It seemed to fall in the opposite direction from Lake Pepin, or to the SW of Mpls. (Last sentence answer to question about direction). The time was approximately 2000 hours - not known for sure.

Mrs. housewife, White Bear Lake, Minnesota, telephone was home watching TV program (Lawrence Welk) at 2015 to 2030 when her attention was attracted by a wide path of golden color in the NW sky. It appeared like a big ball exploding with a long wide streak. It appeared to grow larger and looked like it might strike close by. She called her husband and children. Object was in sight about 7 to 9 seconds and appeared to be falling straight down. She reported it to KSTP radio station.

Mrs. housewife, telephone She was traveling west on Broadway, across street from Russel, and looking up at a store sign. At that time she saw a round form shoot over and down, leaving a streak.
