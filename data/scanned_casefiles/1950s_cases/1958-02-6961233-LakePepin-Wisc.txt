5. All other witnesses describe the object as a fireball.
6. Because of the maneuvers taken, it was obvious the object could be controlled and only a carefully considered estimate of its technical capabilities warranted.
7. Considering other reports, this object appears in the same category as a glowing, rapidly moving, silent object sighted on other occasions.

1. The UFO report in question was submitted under Project SIGN on 12 August 1954, and your message, inclas. AFJN-4-345-1001-3, 21 May 1958, in regard to completed action on UFO sighting of 28 February 1958 at Lake Pepin, Wisconsin.

2. The UFO report in question was submitted under Project SIGN on 12 August 1954, and ARGUS sighting on 12 August 1954. However, this headquarters was informed by the ATIC that any physical investigation would have to be directed by headquarters, 1006th AISS. Headquarters CAAF was informed of this, while this organization was in turn informed to obtain all other details and with its own transportation went to Lake Pepin and investigated all leads on the spot. Also all other available information was obtained.

3. After we had analyzed all reports our conclusions were: 
That the report received on Lake Pepin, Wisconsin, was not completely reliable. Only individual who reported having seen an object on Lake Pepin, was not completely reliable himself. The same commercial fishermen and commercial fishermen at Lake Pepin could not find any object on the lake nor a hole made by an object.
Lake Pepin was covered with ice and snow which made recovery operations impossible.
All other witness reports indicated that an object, probably a meteor, fell at approximately the same time, to the ATIC or Headquarters, CAAF.

Scope of Preliminary Investigation of UFOs Rept (Cont'd)
Been made in regard to an object being seen on 22 February at 2000 hours.
The next stop was Brookings, Minnesota. There was only one cafe located in that town. The owner stated that to his knowledge no one had mentioned seeing an object during the evening of 22 February 1958. The next stop was made at the Police Station at Lake City, Minnesota. Time was 0945.
The Police Chief stated that he had heard nothing until the morning of 1 March 1958 when a Mr. [REDACTED] called him from long distance and informed him to collect any information available as there would be people from the Air Force checking on the report. He then (the Police Chief), called the sheriff of Wabasha, Minnesota, and made inquiries as to any reports being received there. Answer was negative.
The Lake City Police Chief then called the Game Warden for Lake Pepin and made the same inquiries. Game Warden's answer was negative.
Lt. Col. Schumacher and myself then proceeded to Maiden Rock, Wisconsin, where we made inquiries of the cafe owner and [REDACTED]. In both cases Mr. [REDACTED] had called and made the incident known to these individuals. This was the only report they had of the incident. Our next stop was Stockholm, Wisconsin where we made inquiries at [REDACTED]. She stated that a friend of hers had arrived there unexpectedly and after approximately an hour had departed for home. She further stated that Mr. [REDACTED] had mentioned that he was feeling ill and would not be able to stop and see her husband at Maiden Rock, Wisconsin. Also, that she had known Mr. [REDACTED] for approximately 20 years. Time was now 1300.

Report of Prelim Investigation of UFOB Rept (Cont'd)
was, "Mrs. XXXX called me about 2230, 22 February on long distance and told me he had seen an object fall into the lake." He believed that she should know about the report in case some people who might be digging on the lake.
It was bothering him and he was unable to sleep. Outside of this statement she knew of no other information and had heard nothing further of any eye witness accounts. She made a trip along the highway the next day, but saw nothing.
We next proceeded back to Maiden Rock and had lunch. Upon questioning several of the local residents at this point, we failed to receive negative answers. After lunch, at 1430 we proceeded to Red Wing and stopped at the radio station where we questioned the news broadcaster. He had heard nothing and had made no releases on this subject. Departure was made from this area. Upon arrival back at St Paul, Capt Neumann had a call from the 31st ADIV Controller, who stated that a patrolman, Harry G. Roberts, telephone 2341, Frontenac, Minnesota, had a list of witnesses who had seen this object. A call was placed to Mr. Roberts. His report follows:
"I checked all persons in this area and found no one who had actual knowledge. I was in touch with the Game Warden at Wabasha, Minnesota, and he stated that he had been over the lake in the Maiden Rock and Stockholm, Wisconsin, area the 25th of February and had found no holes of unexplained origin." This call came through on 1 March 1958 at 1755 hours.
Meanwhile, calls were placed to a Mrs. XXXX and Mr. XXXX. Reports follow: Time, 1300, 1 Mar 58.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This seems to be a page from an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, that describes an incident involving a "fire ball" or unidentified object falling to the ground.

T/3 st. Manley on 3 March 1953 proceeded to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] for purpose of interviewing them about the object they sighted falling to earth on the 22 Feb 1953.
