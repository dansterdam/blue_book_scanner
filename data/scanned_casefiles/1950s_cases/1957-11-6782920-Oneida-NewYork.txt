FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Albany, New York
November 2, 1957

Lieutenant Colonel L. T. Nichols
Commanding Officer
Intelligence Division
Office of Special Investigations
Headquarters, Air Force Base

Dear Colonel Bush:

This is to advise that at 7:40 p.m. on November 13, 1957, the Albany Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation received a telephone call from FRED K. * * *, of Oneida, New York, who reported that at approximately 7:30 p.m. that evening, he observed what appeared to be a flying saucer hovering over the Oneida area.

Mr. * * * stated that he is employed by the Clark Motor Company, and had spoken to the Vice President of the company, who had also observed the object and felt that it was a flying saucer.

Mr. * * * stated that the object appeared to be approximately two miles in the distance and that it had no lights, but was illuminated in a peculiar manner. He said that it remained hovering for approximately five minutes and then disappeared from sight.

Mr. * * * stated that he was skeptical at first, but now that he has seen this object, he is convinced that it was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. He said that his wife was with him at the time and also observed the object.

According to Mr. * * *, the Albany Police Department was notified and two officers were dispatched to investigate, but they were unable to locate the object upon their arrival.

This information is being furnished to you for your information and any action you may deem appropriate.

Sincerely yours,

AGENR
