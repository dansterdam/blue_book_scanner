The card which the Space Man referred to was a comic advertisement showing some crazy-outrageous thing to a nice new car.

I heard "Burt" at somebody Monkey around your car.

Between the lines of print on the back I noticed the Space Man if anybody was moving just around this however like that. It was asked in just but the answer came back serious on tape.

Mr. [redacted] said the Space Man laughed like an eight year old kid over it too. He also said it was the first acceptable thing sent by direct mail to one of them. A bit of beforehand information made it possible. What I done other can do also.

He told [redacted] that the continent of Atlantic went down due to the miracles of Atomic or a similar power. He also told many other things, which I will gladly tell you if you come to write me, or write to Mountain View Ranch Mountain View Missouri &.

The fact that you write to with one of us would in sight in strictest secrecy if you would be [redacted] it should be that way. The Space People have trusted both of us to keep our word so I believe you can.

It took a lot of courage to write this letter to you. Mr. [redacted] so I hope you will not treat the matter lightly.

I am sincerely yours.

"Often visiting Mr. [redacted] in Galt and my son [redacted]
[redacted] and I spending three days night after Christmas
with him and also exchanging many letters
we cannot find any grounds for doubt that
he states facts which he says he was taken
to other planets. Also all conditions around
him and his own personality would be
conducive to the safe landing of space ships.

We arrived there for my second visit on Dec 24, 1955
space man [redacted] had spent all day Christmas
with Mr. [redacted] and had left a tape recording.

My purpose in writing to you is to give you
the message which was left on the recording.
Here it is just exactly as it was taken
from the recording word for word.

Christmas Message
to the World.

Speaker.
This is a tape recording made in the
home of [redacted] on Christmas day 1955.
my distant cousin [redacted] is here with me.
will say a few words to all of you
in America and all the world.

The most voice you will hear will be of
from Planet Venus. OK. [redacted]

Speaker---

I wish to tell all a Merry Christmas, and
wish [redacted] thankfully for her card. Also to
give her the answer to her question---"

Yes, it has happened to our wishes, too. 
I appreciate such 
effort for souvenirs. I appreciate 
such gifts, and I know in return, as we cannot 
yet expect anything in return, can tell all 
that are. Well tell your wife. I am here 
that asks. Will tell your wife. I have just returned from California, then to 
see my father in Colorado. Now here to see 
you and tell the world on this tape 
recording that this world must give up 
atomic weapons and warfare. The next 
war, if fought, will be on American soil. 
America will be destroyed, then surviving 
all over the world. We are 
here to see which way this world will 
use atomic power, for peace or war. We 
have stood by and seen other planets 
one other, destroy itself. In this Earth 
next? We wonder, and watch and wait. 
Again I say, give up your Atomic Weapons, 
and may peace be on this Earth 
I will tell the world much more that he can 
tell the world.

I know that will want my time 
here to be spent in a private home - like 
way, and I also desire it that way, so 
must say "Good Bye" to all the world from 
perhaps.

I thank you for your talk to the 
people of the world. This is recorded at

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PAGE 4 OF 4 PAGES

12. Base Intelligence Officer - Comments

I have talked to the lady making this report and feel that she is a sincere and trustworthy individual. It is my opinion that what she saw was a radiosonde which was launched at Norfolk Naval Air Station at 1503. This device was carried aloft by a white balloon, 10 ft. in diameter and the winds were from a direction and at a velocity that will give reasonable over the Hampton, Va. area at the time of the reported sighting.

Also there were numerous jet and conventional aircraft in the Hampton, Va. area at that time. I feel convinced that the known radiosonde weather balloon was the object sighted in this instance and feel that no further investigation is necessary.

Dear Sir:

I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. J. Edgar Hoover in which he tells me that he has referred my letter to him to your office. This letter is regarding a man of my acquaintance by name of [redacted] of New View, Missouri. He claims to have been taken to Washington D.C. for interrogation concerning a ride he allegedly took in a flying saucer to Venus. He claims to have letters from the Air Force verifying his story, and is selling books on the strength of this, giving his true experiences. Would you please refer to my letter to Mr. Hoover and answer my questions concerning this man. If he is lying about this, and using the Air Force or FBI to verify it, then he is using the mails to defraud it seems. He says you have the negative to a picture he took of these flying saucers.

Appreciate your consideration. This is of great interest to me.

Yours truly,
/s/ [redacted]

Mrs. [Redacted]

Mr. Charles Wilson
Secretary of Defense
Washington D.C.

Dear Mr. Wilson,

Under you have been paying rather close attention
to the reports on U.F.O.'s and new scientific findings
which are not yet public, then you will notice this
letter comes from a crack-pot. Be that as it may
I promise to give the message out.

Last summer in Detroit a Missouri farmer talked
to our Flying Saucer Club. He told us that he had
been taken to the Moon, to Mars and to Venus in a
space ship.

My sister Florence Collins of Davidson, Michigan
and a sister [Redacted] on the 4th of Oct. 1955. My sister is
a witness, was and enters and is fairly well known
around your home in Bloomfield Hills. I think she has
been to your house, too. I am a ship investigator and
have done quite a bit of work in the same area.
I had a month through Mells studies which your
wife is no doubt very familiar with. So you see this
letter isn't coming to you from someone at the
Pontiac insane asylum.

A very brief account of [Redacted] experience -
on July 30th 1954, [Redacted] saw the saucers
over his house. They came a number of times and
he photographed them twice. I have seen the original
film. The Air Force Intelligence has seen it along
after covering a few times for space pictures, (surely
when to be known would tend to the planets before
anything). There were three men and the youngest
[Redacted] for identification only, told [Redacted]
he was at instant contact and proved it. He was born
in Colorado and was taken to Venus a few years ago
and is now teaching English on Venus.

The text on this page is illegible. The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a landscape with trees, some structures or buildings, and a large circular or spherical object in the sky. The image is very grainy and low contrast, making detailed text recognition impossible.

The only text I can clearly see in this image is "553" written vertically on the right side of the photograph.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing what seems to be a large white circular or oval object in the sky above a landscape with trees and what looks like a fence or structure in the foreground.

The image appears to be a grainy black and white photograph showing a large, soft-edged white or light gray object against a darker background. The object has an irregular, cloud-like shape and takes up a significant portion of the image. There are two small circular holes or marks at the top of the page. The rest of the image is very grainy and difficult to discern specific details. No text is legible in this image.

I apologize, but I cannot find any legible text in this image. The document appears to be a black and white photograph showing a landscape with trees and a fence in the foreground, and a large, bright circular or oval-shaped object in the sky above. The image is grainy and has two white circular marks at the top of the page, likely from hole punches.
