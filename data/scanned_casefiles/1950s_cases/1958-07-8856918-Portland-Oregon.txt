UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SUMMARY
SUMMARY AND EXTRACT REPORT

DATE OF INCIDENT: 24 July 1958

LOCATION OF INCIDENT: Portland, Oregon                TIME: 0529 2 (9:30 P.m.)

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT: School supply helper, happened to look up at a 35 degree direction. Claimed that they appeared the size of a piper club. The objects continued towards the south, descended, broke formation and returned. When last seen approximately 245 degrees. Source states approximately 25 seconds sighting duration. When first observed at approximately 40 degrees elevation, and above 20 degree horizon when last seen (i.e. descending line).*

INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS: Check with current aero chart (WAC #269 - Columbia River) shows that Air Traffic Airway - Amber 1 (V-2) runs almost precisely with the direction of the formation given by source, i.e., 357 degrees into Portland. Plot from source's position to a southward track shows that any a/c formation followed from 355 degrees to a 245 degrees azimuth (as given by him) would be indicated as a descending flight. *Call to W70th COS, Det. 3, Portland, Oregon (ACIC No. 335-17) talked to C.O., Maj. F. E. McDonnell who said he recalls a flight of ADC planes in formation on maneuvers that night with their flight plan destination as somewhere in California. No reports of any UFOs or anything unusual for that time from anyone*. Half check.

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None

FINAL ATIC EVALUATION:

Aircraft, on basis of the following:
1. Has been repeatedly proven that slender fuselage a/c with thin wings will often appear as slender wingless objects against a dark sky.
2. The flight path of the objects was for all practical purposes on the exact track of the Airway into and out of Portland from the north.
3. No other report of any strange phenomena - yet the objects flew over a very large area.
4. Portland GOS confirmed formation of jet a/c on maneuvers in the areas at that general time and date.
