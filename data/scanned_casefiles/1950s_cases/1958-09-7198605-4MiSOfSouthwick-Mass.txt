This report is supplementing previous report 25 Sept 1958 containing the following additional details. It is doubtful if any connection exists between the sighting and the AFSW mission sighting howver an evaluation of this incident and the sighting in the manner at his home at 1930 hrs 3 Oct 1958. During the interview he produced sketches of the object sighted. He stated that he at first thought it was a jet aircraft in trouble but the trouble was not apparent. He became aware of the sighting at about dusk and the object was then already in the sky. It became aware of the sighting, viewed the object through binoculars and appeared to be a reasonably calm person. He and his wife recalled that they had observed a similar obiect but had not reported it for fear of ridicule. The sketch and logs of 25 September 1958 were not plotted on U.S. Air Target Chart ORT 5033-6-991-1-000. No further comment or explanation concerning this sighting is available.
