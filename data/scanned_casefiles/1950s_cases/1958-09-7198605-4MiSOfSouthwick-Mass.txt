k. The Staff Intelligence Officer 99th Bomb Wing, Major Robert F. Nelson, This report is supplementing 9900l message 5932 Dated 02/14/56. It is doubtful if any connection exists between this sighting and the director's ACSW sighting. However to proximity of time and locale. The interview at his home at 1930 hrs 1 Oct 1958. During the interview he produced a sketch he made of the object after arriving home within 15 minutes of the sighting. He stated that he at first thought it was a jet aircraft in trouble and this prompted him to call "Westover AFB, Mass." However the telephone operator connected him with the local newspaper, which is how I first became aware of the sighting. Mr. [redacted] is a technical artist by trade, he flown light aircraft, wears thick bifocal glasses and appeared to be a reasonably calm person. He and his wife recalled that while travelling by car through New Mexico in 1949 they had observed a similar object but had not reported it for fear of ridicule through public notice. The sketch and locs. 1 & 2 in 1/4 Color transparency are attached as enclosures. Coordinates and azimuth information in this report were plotted on U.S. Air Target Chart S0310-9941-100, 2.5D Ed Feb 1956. No further comment or explanation referencing this sighting is available.
