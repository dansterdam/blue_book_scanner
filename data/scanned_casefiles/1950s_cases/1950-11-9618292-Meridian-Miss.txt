g. The CLARION-LEDGER, (Jackson, Mississippi), of 16 November 1950, carried the following account of a "flying saucer," reportedly signed by several persons:

"FOLKS IN BROOKHAVEN SEE FLYING OBJECT"

"Brookhaven & Several persons have reported to the Leader-Times of seeing another 'flying saucer' moving across Brookhaven about 6 p.m. Monday afternoon. Some described it as resembling a 'ball of fire' or 'air sleeve' towed by pilots in target practice.

Other persons speculated that it was merely a vapor trail made visible by the setting sun in the late afternoon skies or left by a trail of smoke from a passing plane.

[Name redacted] said he and Tom Lofton drove out to U. S. Highway 51 and watched the object for about 15 minutes. Sample said he thought it was a blimp or an airplane.

J. A. Smith reported seeing what he described as a 'flying saucer' at about 6:15 p.m. Monday on North Jackson Street. He said several persons observed the strange object passing across the sky in a north westerly direction. He said it left a light pink fire in its path."

h. The Vicksburg EVENING POST (Mississippi) carried the following account of a mystery object sighted in sky:

"MYSTERY OBJECT SIGHTED IN SKY"

Stephens, of the 285rd Fighter Squadron of the Mississippi Air National Guard, said the object was reported in Jackson, McComb and Meridian. He said he flew 830 miles per hour and reached an altitude of 21,000 feet in his pursuit.

Stephens said the object resembled the edge of a bright silver plate and could have been the vapor effect of a high-flying B-36.

1. The Jackson DAILY NEWS, (Jackson, Mississippi), 14 November 1950, carried the following account of a "Mysterious streak of light," reportedly sighted by local citizens:

"Could Be," Jacksonians Say, Seeing Vapor Trail"

"A 'mysterious streak of light' in the sky here late Monday startled local citizens and cause newspapers, radio stations and the Weather Bureau to be swamped with calls.

Officials at the control tower at the airport said it probably was a vapor trail from a jet plane, but Jacksonians who saw it thought otherwise, with many of them saying it had a 'burning tail.'

The same light was reported seen in Florence and Vicksburg and elsewhere.

It was described as changing in color from orange to lemon and then to white as it disappeared toward the horizon.

As the Weather Bureau, officials, said the light first was seen distinctly over the city and that it moved from east to west at a height of well above 30,000 feet." They said they didn't know what it was.

West Jackson residents reported they watched the light for some time before it disappeared. Their guesses as to what it was ranged from 'a flying saucer' to 'something from another world.'

It was described as having an oblong shape.

In Meridian, Miss. [redacted] of the Mississippi Air National Guard said he chased an unidentified object for 65 miles at 300 miles an hour, but never got near it.

He said it did not have a vapor trail, and that at it enabled the edge of a bright tilted plate, bar or flattened out new moon.

Two mechanics at Key Field, in Meridian watched the light with binoculars and said it could have been vapor trails from a B-36.

Mrs. [redacted], 24, who resides between Jackson and Clinton, said she and other members of her family saw the object about 4:45 p.m. They said it was flying at a very high altitude and traveling very fast directly west.

She added that she could not see the front of the object but the rear end looked like a cylinder of flame about five or six feet long.

Mrs. [redacted] said she called the observation tower at the Jackson Air Base who confirmed her report of seeing the strange object, but officials there would not attempt to identify it.

3. ACTION: None contemplated by this Headquarters.
