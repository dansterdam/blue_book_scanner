Stephens, of the 185th Fighter Squadron of the Mississippi Air National Guard, said the object was reported in Jackson, McComb and Meridian. He said his 200 mile an hour and reached an altitude of 21,000 feet in his pursuit. 

The Jackson DAILY NEWS (Jackson, Mississippi), 14 November 1950, carried the following account of a "mysterious streak of light." 

"'Could Be,' Jacksonians Say, Seeing Vapor Trail"

A mysterious streak of light in the sky here late Monday apparently startled local citizens and left newsmen and weather bureau officials wondering what could have caused it.

Officials at the control tower at the airport said it probably was a vapor trail from a jet plane, but Jacksonians who saw it thought otherwise, with many of them saying "it had a bluish trail." 

The same light was reported seen in Florence and Vicksburg.

It was described as changing in color from orange to reddish-brown and then to white as it disappeared toward the horizon.

As the Weather Bureau officials said the light "first was seen directly over the city" and that it moved from east to west at a height of "well above 20,000 feet," they said they could not explain what it was.

West Jackson residents reported they "watched the light for some time before it disappeared." Their guesses as to what it was ranged from "a flying saucer" to "some kind of strange object."

It was described as having an oblong shape.

BAPS Intelligence Report, DO No. 28 Nov 56, Subject: Report of Unconventional Aircraft

In Meridian, Miss., a citizen of the Mississippi Air National Guard said he chased an unidentified object for 55 miles at 300 miles an hour but never got near it. He said it did not have a vapor trail and that it was flying very erratic with a bright flickered flame.

Two mechanics at Keesler Field, in Meridian, watched the flight with binoculars and said it could have been a V-2.

Mrs. J. L. Bentley, who resides between Jackson and Clinton, said she and other members of her family saw the object about 4:45 p.m. They said it was flying at a very high altitude and traveling very fast directly west.

She added that she could not see the front of the object but the rear end looked like a cylinder of flame about 50 or 60 feet long.

Mrs. J. L. Bentley said she called the observation tower at the Jackson Air Base who confirmed her report of seeing the strange object, but officials there would not attempt to identify it.
