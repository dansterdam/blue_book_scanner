17 August 1953                                                UNCLASSIFIED                                                Peoria, Illinois

Description
Two civilian observers at different locations in Peoria saw an unidentified flying object at 1845 CST 17 August 1953. The object appeared in the size of a baseball with a very brilliant white color. No trail or exhaust was observed and the object seemed to be suspended in the air and then slowly moved away. The speed of the object was unknown. The object was observed south of Peoria and moved off south-southeast. At the time of this sighting, personnel of the 791st AC&W Squadron, Hanna City, Illinois, observed a half-moon shaped object in the same vicinity. Total time of observation was 30 minutes.

Discussion
The AC&W Squadron at Hanna City did not pick up any unusual tracks on radar in the same mentioned. Checks with local weather station for possible release of weather balloons in the area. Checks made with airfields in the vicinity precluded that there were no aircraft in the area. Check with upper air research balloon over Peoria at the time of sighting.

Conclusion
Was balloon.
