10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) round, white object, the size of a head of a pin held at arms length, was observed to remain stationary over (or near) Santa Margareta, California.

11. COMMENTS (SEE LTG FROM CAMP SAN LUIS OBISPO)
Two reports arrived from approximately the same place (1 miles apart) and although no definite time is given for the one mentioned from Camp San Luis Obispo, they took place at almost the same time. By comparison of the two reports, they are possibly the same sighting. Due to the fact that many balloons are released in Southern California, and that both of these sightings could fulfill the description of a balloon. Possibly Balloon
