FLYING OBJECT--On Jan. 16 around noon a luminous round flying object was observed in the area of Litschau (3 km from the Czech border). The flying body came from Czechoslovak territory, steeply upward at a terrific speed, crossed the border, and entered Czechoslovak territory again. It then circled and vanished in the direction of the Czech border. Police ascertained that the object had a guided rocket, either its own or else remote control. Its speed was as fast as that of the Czech jets which frequently cruise near the border. The object was observed for two minutes. (Vienna, NEUER KURIER, Jan. 17, 1959--A)
