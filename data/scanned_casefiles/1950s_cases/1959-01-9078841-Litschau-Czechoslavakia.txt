FLYING OBJECT--On Jan. 16 around noon a luminous round flying object was observed in the area of Litschau near the Czech border. The flying body came from Czechoslovakia toward, crossed the border, and moved steeply upward at an immense speed emitting a hissing noise. It then circled and vanished in the direction of the Czech border. Police examined that the object was a guided rocket, since neither round nor shape was similar to a plane's. Its speed was about three times as fast as that of the Czech jets which frequently cruise near the border. The object was observed for two minutes. (Vienna, NEUES KURIER, Jan. 17, 1959--A)
