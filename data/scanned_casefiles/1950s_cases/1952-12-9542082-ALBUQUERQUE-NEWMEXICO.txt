Albuquerque, New Mexico                                                   28 December 1952

I.    Description of Incident

At 2309 CST a military pilot sighted an elongated cigar-like object about the size of a medium bomber with an exhaust about eight times as long as the length of the object itself. It traveled from east to west over Albuquerque, New Mexico. All sighting were visual for a period of 10 to 20 seconds. There were broken high clouds at 30,000 feet with 40 miles visibility.

II.   Discussion of Incident

All air traffic in the area was identified by Kirtland AFB. The object may have been a meteor since the time of sighting was brief. In addition the object had a tail, concern to some networks, not enough correlation information is available to afford a possible solution. ATIC is in the process of checking past sightings against known meteor tracks and an answer might be found here.

III.  Conclusion

Insufficient information.

Very bright white light.
Looked like after burner of a jet which remained visible several seconds after the white light had passed. There were no protrusions of any sort, just round in appearance.

Only

Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

I do not know of any object that had the appearance of what I saw other than a large white light. I could see nothing but the light and either his exhaust trail, after burners, smoke, or what over it was. It looked much like the vapor trail of jets. I called the Kirtland Tower and they advised they had no jets at no I dimagined the thought of a white trail from a jet. Besides, I doubt that a vapor trail from a jet could have been observed in the darkness.

UNCLASSIFIED

TIME:    Saturday, December 27, 1952, 2212 hrs.

PLACE:   200 yards east of the Wyoming-Navajo Intersection on Navajo, Moffras town addition, Albuquerque, New Mexico

SIGHTING: A milky-white object several seconds of arc in diameter. The object was rather motionless having no sharply defined edges but round in shape. A faint luminous trail was visible behind this object for a distance of about 8 to 10 diameters of the object.

This object was traveling east to west in a curved path in a counter clockwise direction and in a manner that would almost place it in the Kirtland Field traffic pattern. (This description of the curved path is very rough since I have no experience in describing the curved path with objects.) The object passed slightly north of the zenith and then behind clouds that the U. S. Weather Bureau said were about 20,000 ft. high. The angle traversed by the object from the point first seen to the point it passed behind the clouds was about 30Â° of arc. The time of observation during which the object traversed 30Â° was about 4 or 5 seconds. No sounds were heard; no evidence of wings, etc.

CONDITIONS
SURROUNDING
OBSERVERS:  Mildred, my wife, first sighted the object from her side of the car. She quickly stopped the car and got out just in time to see the object quickly stopped the car and got out just in time for both of us to see the object pass behind a cloud. We were in the close neighborhood and no sounds were audible.

After several seconds, I looked toward Kirtland Field, and I think I saw the light of an airplane although this white light also disappeared quickly.

SUMMARY
In accordance with ADC 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, subject Unidentified Flying Objects (short title: FLYOBRT), the following report of Unidentified Flying Objects is submitted:

On 27 December, 2209 MST, Central Airlines pilot, shortly after take off from Borger, Texas, observed an unusual aerial phenomenon. The object appeared to be at the same altitude as the observer, traveling from east to west, then north over and around Amarillo. The object appeared like a bright light following by an extended trail or contrail. The object was reportedly only seen from the control tower at Amarillo, Texas. Although attempts to obtain additional information from the tower operator were negative.

This report includes the above mentioned observation and three ground observations from Albuquerque sighting and the Albuquerque sighting was approximately 6 minutes. The reports from Albuquerque indicate the object was traveling at a speed would be near 3,000 MPH.

On 27 December, 1952, 2215 MST, and an operator at Kirtland, Albuquerque, New Mexico, while on duty at the radio station located at the northwest corner of Kirtland Air Force Base, observed an unusual aerial phenomenon. The object was moving from east to west leaving a control or azimuth trail. The object was also observed from a local hospital and another location. A local astronomer studied under Dr. [name redacted], a well known local astronomer. The information given by two military employees at Kirtland differs by two minutes. No aircraft were known to be in the Amarillo-Albuquerque area at the time of the observation. No radar contact was made with the object.
