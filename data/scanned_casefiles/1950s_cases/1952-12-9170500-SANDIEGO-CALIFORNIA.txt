1. SYNOPSIS: Between 1515 and 1525 hours, 17 December 1952, four
members of the U. S. Navy Electronics Laboratory, San Diego 52, California,
sighted two flying objects from their place of employment which they
concluded were definitely not conventional flying aircraft.

2. DETAILS: This District Office is in receipt of a first indorsement from the District Intelligence Officer, Eleventh Naval District,
San Diego, California, accompanied by a letter of transmittal from the
U. S. Navy Eleventh Electronics Laboratory, which has a inclosure the statement of four employees of the Laboratory concerning their sighting of two
unconventional flying objects between 1515 and 1525 hours, 17 December 1952.

3. The sightings were made by G. F. ALTHOUSE, Electronic Scientist; H. W. VOLLMER, Electronic Scientist; HANS WAND EXTERN, Electronic Technician;
and A. J. HOLMES, Electronic Scientist, from Room 1060, Building 33,
of the U. S. Navy Electronics Laboratory.

4. Weather conditions were described as mostly cloudy, with several
rain squalls to the South and East. There were other jet aircraft in
the area.

5. The speed of the two objects was described as being from the
speed of present day jet aircraft to at least five times that speed or
1500 miles per hour.

6. The shape of the objects was described as cigar shape or like
on edge. One felt it presented a circular arc toward the viewer.
One described the objects as being round shape, well defined at edges.

7. With the exception of one who stated one object appeared quite
dark, all stated the objects emanated bright light, but not dazzling.

10. Height was estimated by two viewers as approximately 500 feet.

11. No smoke, vapor or flame was noted emitting from the objects. Their source of flight was described as being without smoothness, given to sudden alterations in direction. The flight of the jet in the area was described as being smooth, no turbulence apparently being present.
