BOSTON MASS.
CASE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
SIGHTINGS OVER PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y.,
20 JUNE 1952

This report contains information provided by the witnesses to the sightings, as well as analysis and conclusions drawn by the investigators. Several individuals observed multiple unidentified objects in the sky on the evening of 20 June 1952 over Port Washington, New York. The objects were described as elliptical in shape, metallic in appearance, and they executed various maneuvers such as hovering, rapid acceleration, and abrupt changes in direction. No further details or evidence, such as photographs, were included in this report.

The text content of the document is as follows:

"an article which appeared in the Boston Herald of that date, and was of particular interest in view of my interview with the witness Howard L. Everett, whose comments are included. The article indicated that the witness had reported seeing an unusual object in the sky, and had notified the authorities. Based on the article, it appears that the witness described seeing an object that was "saucer-shaped" and that moved rapidly across the sky before disappearing. The article also noted that the witness was considered a reliable and credible source. The handwritten notes on the document provide additional details and commentary, but do not include any information that would identify any individuals mentioned in the case."

Transcription of the text in the document:

Oh course they are supposed to be rellow and shiny and hover and perform fantastic aerial maneuvers, but this is not the case in the present instance. My friend 'ho) originally spotted the object says it was a steady and rather dull grayish-white color. As he watched it, it would seem to move ahead for a short distance, then stop and hover for a few seconds, then move ahead again, but always maintaining a steady and even speed, neither accelerating nor decelerating abruptly. It was observed for several minutes before it disappeared from sight. My friend says it made no sound whatsoever, in contrast to some reports of humming or buzzing sounds associated with UFOs.

This object was seen in the early evening, shortly after sunset, when it would have been difficult to make out details of shape or structure. My friend did not attempt to estimate its size or altitude, since he had no known objects nearby for comparison. He is a mature and responsible individual, not given to fantasies or undue excitement. Although he was somewhat puzzled by what he saw, he does not claim it was anything more than an unidentified flying object, the nature of which he cannot explain. He reported it promptly to the authorities, as he felt it was his civic duty to do so, particularly since the object was observed in the vicinity of a major airport.

The text in the document is as follows:

EXTRACT OF REPORT FROM WEATHER BUREAU AIRPORT STATION
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, DATED AUGUST 7, 1952

"On July 22, 1952, from approximately 11:15 PM to 11:26, PST, a flying object was observed which interfered with my 21,000-ft. balloon run at that time. This object was followed with a theodolite as it appeared to be closely associated with the dimming balloon. It was not seen with the naked eye because it seemed more apparent to follow its closely with the theodolite and record the angles and change of colors.

The object was oval shaped with colored lights of red, green, and blue arranged horizontally. The colored lights, when clearly visible, appeared rectangular in shape with rounded corners. The brightness of the lights seemed to depend on the angle of observation.

"During the 11 minutes observed, the object which was southeast of the station gained altitude from an azimuth angle of 115 degrees to 130 degrees and angles of elevation of 20.5 degrees to 23.0 degrees. The object made a three-second maneuver in which the angles of elevation and azimuth remained constant while the colored lights seemed to fade and a blue-white light was observed. When seen through the telescope, the balloon itself appeared as bright as a star of the first magnitude. The object appeared to be circling the 100-gram balloon.

"The object was estimated to be 25,000 ft. from the point of observation at WBAS, Boston, and at a height of 25,000 ft. when first noted, later climbing to a height of 35,000 ft.

"It seemed unlikely to the observer that jet planes could turn repeatedly in such an area as was recorded. The observer checked with the Traffic Control Tower and was informed that no aircraft were in the area. The Police Traffic Control Center received no reports from any plane in the area. Negative results were received from all concerned."

UNCLASSIFIED
29 JUL 1952

10-0AI 21-149
SUBJECT: (Unclassified) UNKNOWN SUBJECT(S): Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, 23 July 1952, Boston, Massachusetts

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D.C.

SYNOPSIS: 
On 23 July 1952, reports of sightings of unidentified phenomena between 2215 and 2300 hours, 23 July 1952, were received from five (5) separate sources. No activity or condition developed that accounts for sightings.

DETAILS:
1. At 0000 hours, 23 July 1952, a telephone call was received at Detachment "W", the District CIC Detachment, Boston Army Base, relaying a report from Lt Commander ADAMS, USN, relative to the effect that he and several others had observed unidentified phenomena over the Braintree area on the evening of 23 July 1952. This sighting was substantiated by reports from an officer at Logan International Airport, Boston, Massachusetts, advised that he observed strange lights between 2315 and 2326 hours, 23 July 1952, additional details of which will be forwarded as received. Headquarters Air Defense Command, Colorado Springs, Colorado advised that reports were received from Roslindale and West Roxbury, Massachusetts, indicating that an undetermined number of persons had observed similar phenomena in that area during the aforementioned period. This District Office interview with Special Agent JULIUS B. POPPINGA on 23 July 1952 are not complete and will be forwarded unless your Headquarters directs otherwise.

2. Information provided by Lt Commander ADAMS:

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document with text describing a reported UFO sighting.

ID-GJX 24-349
(a) Description: Two (2) round, bluish-green lights, much more brilliant than stars, and without sound or exhaust trail. Observer could not estimate the size or distance.

(b) Formation: One directly behind the other and at the same level. Almost exactly the same distance between the two points, but the fact hat they kept this position exactly indicated that they were rigidly connected.

(c) Maneuvers: The lights were sighted at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizon in the southeastern sky. They moved northwest until directly over the observer, at this point the distance between the two lights increased. They then reversed their direction, passed over the observer, and began a wide arc toward the northeast. All maneuvers were on the same horizontal plane, without any noticeable change of altitude.

(d) Disappearances: Lights were not dimmed by distance, but the disappearance was abrupt, as if the objects had been switched off suddenly. They would reappear at another point along the arc, continuing until reaching the approximate point at which the first disappearance occurred.

(e) Time sighted: For approximately 15 minutes, by an officer of the station, who was on duty and reported the sighting.

(e) Manner and location of observation: No optical or mechanical aids were employed. Observation was made from the administration building at Squantum Naval Air Station, Quincy, Massachusetts.

(g) Identification and description on observer: Lt Commander
has served twelve (12) years active duty in the U.S. Navy, primarily as a pilot. He is presently performing duties of assistant personnel officer at Squantum. He stated that falling stars, jet exhaust trails, flares, and other lights were distinctly different from any of these.

(h) Existing conditions that might account for sighting: None. No physical evidence exists, and no interruption of station activities was taken.

UNCLASSIFIED
Weather conditions described the sky as perfectly clear, according to exceptional visibility. The weather conditions at 2220 hours EDT on July 22, 1952 were reported as follows: "Clear, west wind 11 mph, visibility 15 miles."
Detachment (1) advised that 1st Sgt ANTHONY DI NALLO, Marine Air, observed the phenomena with him, and that Sgt. MELVIN L. HALL, also of Detachment (1), observed it from a point one (1) mile north of Wollaston, Massachusetts on 22 July 1952. DI NALLO and HALL were separately interviewed by Special Agent JULIUS B. POPHAM, and their observations were confirmed. No explanation from this given by USAF.
(4) During his tour of duty, ADAMS received a total of six (6) telephone calls from the following persons who, according to ADAMS, reported unidentified flying objects in the vicinity of the Boston area: 
1. Sergeant, R - Hingham, Massachusetts.
2. Corporal, A - Cambridge (who observed the lights from Wollaston Beach near Weymouth).
3. Lieutenant, J - Medford.
4. Corporal, J - Weymouth.
Landings in these areas were not contemplated, unless your Headquarters directs otherwise.
2. Information provided:
(a) Description: Four small lights, red and green, at times completely enveloped by a single, bluish-white light much brighter than a star of ordinary magnitude. Shape, round, unusual. Cloud, and speed were not determined.
(b) Formation: None. Appeared as one (1) body only.
(c) Maneuvers: Appeared to make three complete elliptical circles at a constant altitude on one of 22 degrees. Apparently showed to slight most a step before changing direction.
(d) Time sighted: From 2315 to 2326 hours, 22 July 1952. Observers had no difficulty to track the objects moving faster than normal aircraft, but was prevented from making further observation because of other duties.
(e) Because of observations: Object was not visible to the naked eye, but was observed through a weather Bureau theodolite. A telescope used for tracking weather balloons could not be determined from markings or from observatory personnel. However, their activity indicated that balloons 15 feet in diameter could be seen through the instrument at a distance of 20 miles.

(2) The observer was standing on the observation platform at the weather bureau observatory at eastover, southwick as he fixed his attention on a peculiar light while tracking a balloon at an azimuth of 120 degrees for southeast. He noticed that the light did not change attitude, and remained within an arc of 22 degrees from the horizontal.

(a) Information on observer: This observer is a weather observer (3) and no evidence to his familiarity with all types of aircraft was advised other than his training caused by his occupation. He could not account for the peculiar light by anything else such as search light reflections or shooting stars that he notoriously observed for the existence.

(h) Existing condition that might account for sighting: None. No physical evidence exists, and no interception action was taken.

ACTION:
Two (2) copies of this report have been forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Material Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. Attn: MCINT-A, no further action contemplated by this District Office.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects, Boston, Mass.
DATE OF INFORMATION: 29 Jul 52
DATE OF REPORT: 22 Aug 52
REFERENCES: Nil
SUMMARY: This report is intended to clarify two previous "sighting" reports, per
reference. This sighting occurred on 23 Jul 52, was investigated, and considered
resolved. The REPORT submitted pertaining to sighting by Lt M--- was based
on brief notes taken at the time and was neither complete nor entirely accurate. 
The details are as follows:
On 23 Jul 52, two pilots, Lt A--- and Lt B---, USAF, were flying a routine training
mission over the Boston area. During the flight, they observed two extremely bright
lights in the sky which appeared to be traveling at high speed. Estimating the angular
separation between the two objects, the pilots determined that they were actually one
object, possibly an aircraft. After a period of observation, they lost sight of the object
as it passed out of view. Upon landing, the pilots reported their observation to their
base. Based on their description, station intelligence concluded that the object sighted
was probably a meteor or another natural phenomenon, rather than a man-made aircraft.
This conclusion was based on the high speed, the brightness of the light, and the lack
of any other confirming evidence that the object was an aircraft. The pilots concurred
with this opinion when they were interviewed shortly after the incident.
REFERENCE: Nil
CONCLUSION: The details contained in this report clarify the facts surrounding the
previous "sighting" reports by Lt M---. It is the opinion of the undersigned that the
object sighted on 23 Jul 52 was a meteor or other natural phenomenon, and not an
unidentified flying object. No further investigation is considered necessary.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (FILE NO. 6582-55)

STATION: BOSTON AIRPORT, BOSTON, MASS.

DATE OF REPORT: 23 JUL 52

DATE OF INFORMATION: 22 JUL 52

WEATHER: CLEAR, NO CLOUDS, 4/10 VISIBILITY, LIGHT WIND NORTHWEST, ALTITUDE: 1000 FT, OBS: LOGAN AIRPORT, BOSTON, MASS.

REFERENCE: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS SIGHTED IN THE BOSTON AREA

SUMMARY: (See continuation sheet for complete summary of report)

The purpose of this information is to determine whether or not this station had airborne aircraft in the Boston area, saying he had picked up an "unknown" sighting. The HQ receiving the call passed wing instructions to the information necessary for this type reporting, and passed these instructions to the Logan Airport. Subsequent report from Mr. [REDACTED] was received, via Base Operations MAC, RT NO: 1700-2, 23 JUL 52.

The Base Operations HGO indicated that Mr. [REDACTED] is an "old-timer" in the weather game and had made the sightings when preparing to make a weather observation. The unidentified points of this report in the supporting data indicate that observations were initially made just prior to, and during some of, the time sightings and attempted intercept was being made by F-94 aircraft of the 33rd FIS (GCI AW) in the Boston area. (These sightings (or F-94) were reported by General message 23 Jul 52).

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Flying Object (FLYOBJ)
DATE OF REPORT: 23 Jul 52
DATE OF INFORMATION: 22 Jul 52 
PLACE: Boston, Mass.
WEATHER CONDITIONS: Weather Observer, Logan Airport, Boston, Mass.
SUMMARY: The course of information contained in Part II first called in to ATIC and ours to determine whether or not this sighting had disclosed aircraft in Boston area, saying he had picked up an "unknown" sighting. The HCO receiving the call queried the intelligence section, received instructions to interrogate further and obtain detailed information.

The HCO receiving the call queried the intelligence section, received instructions to interrogate further and obtain detailed information. Subsequent report from Mrs. ** was received, via Base Operations 1800, at approximately 1700Z, 23 Jul 52.

The HCO operations indicated that HCO is an "old-timer" in the weather game and had made the sightings when preparing to make a weather observation. The significant point of this report is that observations were initially made and attempted intercept was made by F-94B aircraft of the 33rd FIS (Otis AFB) in the Boston area. (These sightings (by F-94) were reported by District means 23 Jul 52).
