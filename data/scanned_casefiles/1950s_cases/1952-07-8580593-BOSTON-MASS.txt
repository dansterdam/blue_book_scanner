[The rest of the text is a handwritten narrative that appears to be a detailed account of some observations, but due to the handwritten nature and some areas being slightly blurry, I cannot guarantee a 100% accurate transcription. The text discusses various observations, locations like Boston, San Francisco, and mentions dates around July. The writing seems to be a personal account of some event or series of events, possibly related to UFO observations.]

The last line appears to be cut off and contains the word "(over)" suggesting there might be additional text on the reverse side of the page.

EXTRACT OF REPORT FROM WEATHER BUREAU AIRPORT STATION
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, DATED AUGUST 7, 1952

"On July 22, 1952, from approximately 11:15 PM to 11:26, DST, a flying object was observed which interfered with my 23,000-ft. balloon run at that time. This object was followed with a theodolite as it appeared very bright in comparison with the dimming balloon lighting unit. It was not seen with the naked eye because it seemed more important to follow it closely with the theodolite and record the angles and change of color.

"This object was oval or disk-shaped with colored lights of red, green, and blue arranged horizontally. The colored lights, when clearly visible, appeared rectangular in shape with rounded corners. The brightness of the lights seemed to depend on the angle of observation as the object moved.

"During the 11 minutes observed, the object which was southeast of the station, stayed within the reciprocal azimuth angles of 118 degrees to 130 degrees and angles of elevation of 20.5 degrees to 23.0 degrees. The object made three complete circles in that area. It was not moving very fast. As the object moved, the colored lights seemed to fade and a blue-white light was observed. When seen through the theodolite, this blue-white light was as bright as a star of the first magnitude. The object appeared to be circling the 100-gram balloon.

"The observer estimated the object as being at least 10 miles from the point of observation at WBAS, Boston, and at a height of 25,000 ft. when first noted, later climbing to a height of 35,000 ft.

"It seemed unlikely to the observer that jet planes could turn repeatedly in such an area as recorded. The observer checked with the airport Traffic Control Tower and the Air Route Traffic Control Center to see if any planes were holding in this area. Negative replies were received from all concerned."

SUBJECT: (Unclassified) UNKNOWN SUBJECT(S): Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft, 2315-2400 hours, 22 July 1952, Boston, Massachusetts

TO:   Director of Special Investigations
       Headquarters, USAF
       Washington 25, D. c.

SYNOPSIS:

On 23 July 1952, reports of sightings of unidentified phenomena between 2315 and 2400 hours, 22 July 1952, were received from five (5) separate sources. No activity or correlation developed that accounts for sightings.

DETAILS:

1. At 0800 hours, 23 July 1952, a telephone call was received at Detachment "D", Headquarters, 1st District CSI, from the duty officer, 108th CIC Detachment, Boston Army Base, relaying a report from 1st Cos. Major H. J. ADAMS, Squantum Naval Air Station, Quincy, Massachusetts, to the effect that he and several others had observed unidentified phenomena during the night of 22 July 1952. At 1400 hours, 23 July 1952, CWO J. B. HALEY, weather observer, U. S. Weather Bureau, Logan Airport, Boston, Massachusetts, advised that he observed strange lights between 2315 and 2326 hours, 22 July 1952. Additional calls reported similar phenomena were received from Weymouth, Rocksbury, all in Massachusetts; and from personal interviews with and by Special Agent JULIUS B. POPPINGA on 23 July 1952 are set forth. This District Office does not contemplate interview of and unless your Headquarters directs otherwise.

UNCLASSIFIED

(a) Description: Two (2) round, bluish-green lights, much more brilliant than a first magnitude stars, having no aerodynamic features, and moving without sound or exhaust trail. Observer could not estimate size, speed, or altitude of lights.

(b) Formation: One directly behind the other and at the same level. Aware could not estimate the actual distance between the lights, but stated that when looking at them over his outstretched arm, a hand's breadth covered the space between them. This formation did not change.

(c) Maneuvers: The lights were sighted at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizon in the southeastern sky. They moved northwest until directly over the point of observation, then reversed their direction, again 45 degrees, again reversed their direction, passed over the observer, and began a wide arc toward the northeast, all maneuvers were on the same plane, without any noticeable change of altitude.

(d) Manner of disappearance: Lights were not dimmed by distance, but the disappearance was abrupt, as if objects had been switched off suddenly. The loud light disappeared first, while the second one continued until reaching the approximate point at which the first disappeared and then vanish.

(e) Time sighted: [redacted], who was on duty as officer of the Day, received a call from East Weymouth, Massachusetts, advising that two very bright lights were moving in the direction of the Naval Air Station. The immediately next outside and sighted the phenomena. The time was 2345 EWT. The maneuvers described lasted about three (3) minutes, or until 2348 EWT.

(f) Manner and location of observation: No optical or mechanical aids were employed. Stood just north of the administration building at Squantum Naval Air Station, Quincy, Massachusetts.

(g) Identifying information on observer: Lt Commander has served twelve (12) years active duty in the U. S. Navy, primarily as a pilot. He is presently performing duties of assistant personnel officer at Squantum. He stated that falling stars, jet exhaust trails, search light reflections, and navigational lights on conventional aircraft are all very familiar to him and that the phenomena described was distinctly different from any of these.

(h) Existing condition that might account for sighting: None. No physical evidence exists, and no interception action was taken.

(c) Weather conditions: described the sky as perfectly clear, after exceptional visibility. Weather conditions at 2320 hours CDT, 22 July 1952 were reported by the U. S. Weather Department, Logan Airport, Boston, Massachusetts, as follows: "Clear; west wind in mph visibility 15 plus all temperature 63; humidity 58%"

(c) advised that S Sgt ANTHONY DI NALLO, Marine Air Detachment, Squantum, observed the phenomenon with him, and that Sgt DI NALLO observed it from a point one (1) mile south of the station but at the same time. On 22 July 1952, DI NALLO and HIGGINS were separately interviewed by Special Agent JULIUS D. POPPINGA.

(k) During his tour of duty, ADAMS received a total of six (6) telephone calls from the following persons, who, according to ADAMS, reported substantially the same thing:
[Redacted names]
East Weymouth, Weymouth
Landings (near Wollaston Beach near Weymouth); and [Redacted name], Cambridge (who observed the lights), Roxbury. Interviews with these persons are not contemplated, unless your Headquarters directs otherwise.

3. Information provided by [Redacted]

(a) Description: Four small lights, red and green, at times completely enveloped by a single, bluish-white light much brighter than a star of first magnitude. Shape, sound, course, altitude, and speed were not determinable.

(b) Formation: None. Appeared as one (1) body only.

(c) Maneuvers: Appeared to make three complete elliptical circles at constant altitude within an arc of 22 degrees. Apparently slowed to almost a stop before changing direction.

(d) Time sighted: From 2315 to 2326 hours, 22 July 1952. Observer had to abandon the light to prepare weather report, and was prevented from making further observation because of other duties.

(e) Manner of observation: Object was not visible to the naked eye, but was observed through a Weather Bureau theodolite, a telescope, and instruments used for tracking weather balloons. Lake and Long power could not be determined from markings or from observatory personnel. However, they advised that balloons 18 feet in diameter could be seen through the instrument at a distance of 50 miles.

(c) Location of observer and position of light(s):
Two standing on the observation platform at the Weather Bureau Observatory at Logan Airport, Boston, Massachusetts. He first located the light while tracking a balloon at an azimuth of 120 degrees or southeast, at a vertical angle of 22 degrees. From the horizontal, he noticed that the light did not change altitude, and remained within an arc of 22 degrees, from an azimuth of 118 degrees to 140 degrees.

(d) Information on Observer: He has been a weather observer for eight (8) years. The airport location of the observatory gives evidence to his familiarity with all types of aircraft. He advised that if the lights were caused by jet aircraft, he could not account for their slow speed during changes of direction. Could think of nothing else such as search light reflections or shooting stars that could account for the sightings.

(h) Existing condition that might account for sightings: None.
No physical evidence exists, and no interception action was taken.

ACTION:
Two (2) copies of this report have been forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Tactical Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, Attention: MCIS. No further action contemplated by this District Office.

This report is intended to clarify and resolve two previous reports, per above and Incls.

Reference Incl 1:
The report submitted pertaining to sighting by was has been resolved to the satisfaction of the investigating officer. The sighting at the same time F-94B aircraft, piloted by Lts Hearn & Lafleur of the 58th Ftr Intcp Sq, were in his surveillance area.

After considerable detailed conversation with those two pilots as to their tactics, etc., a thorough interrogation brought out that they had sighted it is the opinion of the undersigned that was tracking their aircraft.

The F-94B made definite 360°.
Afterburners were lit, power advanced and retarded.
The is likely momentary with the appearance of the afterburner blast of a jet fighter as it appears at night, and during maneuvers.

Reference Incl 2:
After considerable detailed conversation with the pilot making the sighting there was further officer confirmation with the base (Otis AFB) weather officer, and (now) the reporting pilot, that the object sighted and reported as unidentified was a weather balloon.

Further, at the opinion of all three that the object (resolved as a pilot balloon) was most likely released from Westover AFB, Mass.

Because of this conclusion no further report was made on the object.

SUMMARY:
The sources of information contained in Part II first called in to Otis AFB Operations to determine whether or not this station had airborne aircraft in Boston area, saying he had picked up an "unknown" sightings. The NCO receiving the call queried wing intelligence section, received instructions on information necessary for this type reporting, and passed these instructions to Mr. at Logan Airport. Subsequent report from Mr. was received, via Base Operations NCO, at approximately 1700Z, 23 Jul 52.

The Base Operations NCO indicated that Mr. is a "old-timer" in the weather game and had made the sightings when preparing to make a weather observation.

The significant point of this report is that observations were initially made just prior to, and during some of, the time sightings and attempted intercept was being made by F-94B aircraft of the 58th FIS (Otis AFB) in the Boston area. (These sightings (by F-94B) were reported by electrical means 23 Jul 52.)
