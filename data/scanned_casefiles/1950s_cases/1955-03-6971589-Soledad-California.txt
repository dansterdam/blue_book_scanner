6. DURATION OF SIGHTING 
One (1) round

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) round object, the size of a nickel held at arm's length, was observed for only a few seconds. The object moved straight and was reported as a 15 degree angle. The pilots scrambled aircraft and searched the area, but no other confirmation could be made. AIRCRAFT reported as 20/010 at 50 thousand feet, moving like a jet but showed no confirmation of its flight.

12. CONCLUSIONS
D - Possibly Balloon
E - Possibly Aircraft

A check of astronomical charts fails to reveal any unusual activity that could account for the sighting. The vanishing and reappearance of the sighting, along with the inability to obtain any further definite information, which prevents the possibility of an accurate analysis, seem to indicate the possibility of an aircraft.
