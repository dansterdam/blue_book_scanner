10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
1) Round, Red & green flashes. Lights
flashed on and off. Vertical movement.
Area searched by 2 F-51 a/c. Negative
results. Local A/c & w had slow moving
blip under obs, which faded.

2) Round, silvery white, drifting
straight west.

11. COMMENTS
A flashing red and green light,
rising vertically, could indicate a balloon. It is feasible
that ball payload was picked up
by the radar, then released.

[Remaining text is partially illegible or appears to be in a coded format]

The number "4" is written in the top right corner of the page.

The document appears to be a military communication or teletype message, likely from the 1950s based on the filename context.

One (1)

8. COURSE
Rising (15°)

9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) round object, the size of a nickel held at arms length, was observed to rise from the ground at a 45 degree angle. The object flashed red and green alternately. Pilots scrambled alert. It and searched the area thoroughly but without results. 666th ACRON reported at 30/0152 they had a slow moving 110 in that area, but for only for sweeps and then faded.

11. COMMENTS
A check of astronomical charts fails to reveal any heavenly bodies in the direction of the sighting. The flashing red and green lights, which were rising, seem to indicate the possibility of an aircraft.
