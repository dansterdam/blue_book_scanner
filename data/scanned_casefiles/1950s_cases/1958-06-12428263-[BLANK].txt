Letter to ATIC 20 May 1956
Suspense 27 May 56 in Arlington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Arcier:

Here is a letter from Congressman Henderson of the 15th District, Ohio, concerning UFO's.

He asks many questions and we desire to have complete answers to each one in response to his letter.

He also wants ten of the best sightings in the last five years which have been classified as "unknowns". Please oblige to the best of your ability.

Major Boland and I intend to hand-carry the reply to Mr. Henderson and brief him on the entire project as Boland did Chairman Vinson and we intend to show him the minutes of the Panel meetings leading to their Formal Report.

I suspect the letter was inspired by a constituent in Ohio but, since the Congressman uses first person, we must handle as a personal congressional inquiry.

I need this information in my office no later than 27 May 1958. Sorry for the time element but their suspense to me is the next day.

Sincerely,

Hon. Neil H. McElroy
Secretary of Defense
Department of Defense
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Mr. Secretary:

I have read with considerable interest the book, "The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects," by Edward J. Ruppelt, telling of the work of Project Blue Book.

In order to be brought up to date with respect to information developed since Ruppelt left the project, I should appreciate having the answer to several questions. Briefly, these questions are outlined below.

1. Is Project Blue Book, or some similar project, still in operation to receive, investigate and evaluate UFO reports?

2. Have reports of UFO's still continued to come in? If so, how many since 1953? How are these distributed by year and month? How many have been classified as "unknowns" by year and month?

3. Have any efforts been made to get more scientific data on UFO's than is provided by visual sightings by ground or air observers, or by visual observance of radar equipment? For example, have any films been made or radar screens when a UFO is picked up? Have any efforts been made accurately to track and triangulate UFO's so as to give more accurate information on speed, size and altitude? Have any tests been conducted to ascertain whether there is a connection between background radiation and the presence of a UFO? Have spectro-meters been used to try to analyse the light emitted by UFO's? Have films been taken or UFO's? In addition to knowing if any of the above or similar efforts have been made, I should appreciate knowing if any of the above or similar experiments have been planned.

4. Could you furnish me reports on say ten of the best sightings in the last five years which have been classified as "unknowns"?

D. As with any free-lance author, Mr. Ruppelt's Theories, opinions, and conclusions are his own, and not necessarily those of the Air Force. His book was reviewed and passed on by Hqs USAF from a security viewpoint only. While most of the statements in his book are factual, the inferences and implications that he attempts to leave are definitely questionable.

As project officer of UFO program, Ruppelt had good knowledge and appreciation of various technical and scientific fields; competent in monitoring investigations, studies; collecting and correlating data for analyses, and conclusions. However, he was not an expert in highly specialized fields such as astrophysics, meteorological optics, psychological influences, etc., for which Air Force has relied on many scientists and specialists, whose conclusions are considered more valid.

E. Answers and info in order of questions submitted in Mr. McElroy's letter: (1) Project Blue Book is a continuous Air Force project; is directly related to Air Force responsibility of defense of Air Space over U.S.; and rigidly prescribed by a standing directive, AFR 200-2, for the detection, identification and analysis of things in the air that may be a threat to U.S. (2) Yes, Reports still continue to come in. (3) Since 1953 a total of 2764 reports have been received, for an average of slightly over 550 per year.

(4) Distribution by year and month (Statistics to be handcarried your office) (5) Unknowns by year and month (to be handcarried) (6) Yes (7) Yes. Numerous times,and often involve very experienced radar operators. This is standing requirement for radar operators when object considered UFO and photo equipment available. Examples: Some time ago Navy rushed to ATIC approximately 3000 ft of radar film of UFO observed in Far East. Also, a B-36 radar operator with 11 yrs experience photographed exceptionally sharp UFO's showing on his screen while flying over the South Atlantic. Analysis confirmed the actual nature of the UFO's. (8) Yes. Tracking has been done through Theodolite, radar and other instruments. Triangulation is a part of the standard analysis technique, and is utilized where two or more observers report the same object from separate locations. (9) Yes.

Results negative. For example, Geiger Counter sweeps of some aircraft involved with alleged UFO's at high altitudes shows a slightly higher radioactivity than normal. Reason: Aircraft receive a greater dosage of cosmic rays at high altitudes. Example: Mantell Case, (which apparently prompted this query).

(10) Yes. Specialized combination spectrographic - stereocamera instruments are located in approximately 60 strategically located sites in the U.S. Results: negative. Only conventional objects in those few spectrographic photos taken.

(11) Yes. Those not found to be hoaxes, photographic flaws, mistaken identification, and optical illusions caused by adverse weather, light exposure or other conditions, are at best, only large and small indeterminate spots of light.

(12) In order to improve its investigative, detection and analytical techniques and capabilities, the Air Force is continuously testing and experimenting in this field. For example, the world-wide "Moonwatch" facilities are often called upon for data to assist in identifying reported unidentified aerial objects. The services of all professional astronomical observatories are at the Air Forces disposal, and also including the FBI, OSI, ONI and others where needed. (13)

Ten best "Unknowns" of the last five (5) years (Re telecon between Maj. Tacker and Capt. Gregory 1330 hrs, Fri. 23 May 58. The conclusion was that this requirement could not be fulfilled during time period, and that interview with Mr. Henderson could cover subject.) (14) The Air Force is advised of foreign sightings by various U.S. government agencies and personnel overseas.

Until recently very few foreign UFOs reported. Definitely established increase is proportionate to number of Flying Saucer and UFO books distributed overseas. (15) Only a very small percentage of UFO reports officially issued by foreign governments or our allies. The majority generally qualify them with opinion that objects are probably aircraft or other airborne (man-made) vehicles.

Maj. Byrne AFCIN/XIA
June 23, 1958

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Briefing of Representative Henderson and Colleagues on the
Air Force Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Program

1. On 20 June 1958, Major Boland, SAFLL and Major Tacker, SAFIS,
assisted by Mr. Ardern, AFCIN-4XL, and Maj Byrne, AFCIN-XIA, briefed
the following House members, in the Capitol chamber of Representatives
John F. Henderson, Ohio.

Rep. Henderson, Ohio
Rep. Cramer, Florida
Rep. Marguon, Washington
Rep. (Mrs.) Walker, Washington
Mr. Mongel (Adm. Aid--Henderson)
Mr. Bachelor (Adm. Aid--Cramer)
Mr. Toly (Adm. Aid--Marguon)
Mr. Gordon (Adm. Aid--Griffen, Mich.)

2. The briefing was prepared in response to a personal request
by Rep. Henderson who had previously submitted a series of questions
on UFO's. AFCIN prepared the answers to these questions and supplied
the necessary briefing material.

3. Members of Congress are constantly besieged by constituents
regarding UFO's, by letters, telephone and personal visits. With rare
exception, such requests are forwarded to SAFLL for answer. The lack
of information on UFO's professed by the Congressman causes a certain
amount of professional embarrassment. As a result, a great number of
Congressmen and their administrative aids have indicated an interest
in first-hand information on UFO's. SAFLL, on the urging of SAFIS
and AFCIN, seized this opportunity to prepare a number of briefing
kits, containing reproductions of statistical information, charts and
graphs, individual case histories, and such other related material
that would give the reader a rather comprehensive knowledge of the
subject. These kits were submitted at the time of the subject
briefing. It is expected that additional requests will be made for
kits as word travels regarding their availability.

4. The Congressional audience was favorably impressed by the
presentation. One apparent dedicated skeptic, at the conclusion of
the briefing, professed his complete faith and confidence in the
Air Force handling of UFO's. Several members indicated that they
were now prepared to deal directly with their constituents without
calling on SAFLL.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

5. The subject briefing, scheduled for one hour, lasted the full morning, which attests to the Congressional interest in the subject. The following is believed to have accrued from the briefing, with members expressing:

a. Confidence in the Air Force UFO program.

b. An understanding of the problems the Air Force faces in administering the program.

c. Acceptance of responsibility to personally advise their constituents on UFO matters.

d. Agreement that it would be unwise to give the subject undue publicity, particularly in an open or closed formal Congressional hearing.

e. Distrust in private organizations and authors, as giving undue impetus to the existence of "flying saucers" and stimulating unwarranted public hysteria.

6. Mr. Archer addressed the group as a technical consultant. Maj. Byrne, in the capacity as administrative consultant, clarified certain answers given by the ATIC representative, to preclude possible misunderstanding on how the UFO program is administered Air Force wide.

7. The excellent briefing material prepared by AFOIN-4 and the personal attendance of Mr. Archer, who impressed the group with his profound knowledge, deserve special note as reason for success of the briefing.

8. Classified portions of the UFO Scientific Panel Report of 1953 were made available to and receipted for by the Congressmen present.
