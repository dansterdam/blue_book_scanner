1. This office was telephonically contacted on 10 April 1958 by
the above Subject who advised that she was in possession of some 8mm
movie film which contained pictures of an unidentified flying object
sighted by her in the early part of 1958. Mrs was interviewed
by Special Agent DOUGLAS W. ALEXANDER of this office on 11 April 1958 at
which time she presented a real containing 200 feet of 8mm film which she
advised contained the pictures referred to above. Due to the lapse of
time since the sighting, Mrs was unable to furnish sufficient
information upon which to render complete information, pursuant to the
provisions of paragraph 7d, AFR 200-2; however, she furnished the follow-
ing information:

a. Film Data: Bolex H-3 Deluxe, Switar Lens 1:1.5 (f:1.25mm)
Lens opening 1.5; distance - infinity. The entire reel of film was
exposed over the period January to February 1958, however, based on the
sequence of the scenes in the film she estimated that the sighting would
have taken place during the period 1 to 9 January 1958. The pictures in-
volving the Unidentified Flying Object were exposed at approximately 0100
to 0130 hours with a full moon. Mrs stated that she first
thought the object to be an unusually large star and observed it through
a pair of binoculars for a period of about five minutes, during which time
it appeared to be moving towards her and increasing in size. She then
aimed the camera at the object which appeared to be approaching her from
a due west direction. At about this time the object turned at right angles
and proceeded north. There was no sound accompanying the object. Mrs.
further advised that she was in the rear of her residence at 1226 Lathrop,
River Forest, Illinois, taking pictures of the moon when she first observed
the object. She further advised that she did not report the sighting at
that time.

Unidentified Flying Object Sighted by [redacted]

2. Examination of the film at the 24th District OSI office through use of a standard 8mm motion picture projector disclosed that the portion of film containing pictures of the alleged unidentified flying object is approximately six inches in length. The film is color film and the object appears red-orange in color; however, no other identifying features could be made due the short period during which the pictures appear on the screen. The film has been returned to Mrs. [redacted], however, she expressed a willingness to furnish the film for further examination and evaluation if desired. Mrs. [redacted] is employed in the office with her husband, an Attorney, at [redacted] LaSalle Street, Chicago 3, Illinois.
