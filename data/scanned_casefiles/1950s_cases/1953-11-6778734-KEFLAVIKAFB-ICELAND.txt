Headquarters, Iceland Air TR-526-53
Defense Force, Keflavik Airport, Iceland

1. Shortly after taking off from Keflavik Airport in NAV 467 L-79 on Local flight, Major Charles J. Mack (AF 17212), Keflavik tower operator last Lt. G. Gislason, L7716t with Major Mack, observed that he (Major Mack) had observed an unusual sighting at 271830Z. The sighting was described as a bluish light, coming in an easterly direction, at an estimated speed of 20-30 knots. The light climbed from about 1,000 ft. to 5,000 ft. then disappeared.

2. At 830 on 23 Nov 53, the reporting officer (Major Mack) who was pilot in command of T-33 jet aircraft, while in a climbing turn at approximately 1,000 ft. altitude, estimated air speed 170 mph, observed the "something" which appeared to be a light blue or white object. He was about 10 miles from Keflavik at 12,000 ft. The G-29 was approximately 10 miles from Keflavik on a northwest heading.

3. At 1020Z, as he was concluding his turn to pick up a heading of 270 relative, Major Mack observed a light in the vicinity of 2 miles south of Keflavik Airport, at an estimated altitude of 1,500 ft. Moving with normal speed and direction, on a heading parallel with his course, it continued moving in that direction, climbing at an angle of approximately 45° until it was nearly out of sight. Major Mack continued to brighten or dim his aircraft lights and disappear. Major Mack observed the light for approximately 7 to 8 minutes and believed that it was a celestial phenomenon. However, it disappeared.

4. The sighting was confirmed by the copilot, Captain J. MCCULLEY, 1971st, who said only that he had only observed the incident and had nothing to add except that he had seen a bluish light moving in an easterly direction.

5. Major Mack has been flying for 12 years and has flown T-33 type jet aircraft. He stated that the high percentage of time that he had observed an airborne jet aircraft mid-air, however, that he had never observed the flame of an airborne jet aircraft at this time. Take was normal except the 11 pm was not a celestial body.

6. The local weather report at 271620Z was scattered clouds at 25,000 ft., broken clouds at 15,000 ft., visibility 15 miles, wind NNW 4 knots, altitude 20-275, to weather balloons were released during the time, made airborne in the Keflavik area.

7. Records at MCCORA Operations Command indicate that only the T-33 and G-29 aircraft in the area during the time of sighting were those mentioned. Further, no correlation was reported that no airborne aircraft were being worked by that facility during the time of the sighting. The 95th Air Division reported that no jet aircraft were airborne, and further reported no correlation could be known.

8. Lacking information which would tend to support Major Mack's opinion that the light may have been a jet flame, the officer undertaking the investigation concludes as a possible astronomical phenomenon.
