AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object
Location: Fifteen miles north of Goodland, Kansas
Date of Observation: 9 May 1952
Date of Report: 29 April 1952

To: Director of Intelligence, Hq USAF, Washington 25, D.C.

Summary:
The following observation of an unidentified flying object was reported to the Director of Intelligence, 906th Bombardment Wing M, Forbes Air Force Base, Topeka, Kansas, on 5 May 1952:

1/Lt. [redacted], 321st Bombardment Squadron, a B-29 bombardier reports the sighting took place at 9200 CST, 29 April 1952, at a position 15 miles north of Goodland, Kansas. (39°9'N/100°30'W). The aircraft was in a bombardment configuration and the aircraft was cruising at 30,000 feet pressure altitude on an easterly heading just above a 10/10 undercast at the time. The sky was clear except for a slight haze, through which the stars and moon were clearly visible. Then noted directly ahead at a 6.5 degree elevation, a soft white fan-shaped light apparently 5,000 feet above, traveled very rapidly in a westerly direction toward the aircraft. The light pulsated at an estimated 3 to 4 times per second, and passed overhead with great speed in about 2 seconds. After which observation was blocked by the B-29 airframe. The light only was seen, with no visible fuselage. The base of the light appeared approximately 50 feet across, extending to 100-150 feet at the trailing edge. No audible sound was heard, nor any radio interference noted. No interruption of check was made at the time, but subsequent questioning of the crew by this observer, indicates that no cause can be found.

Investigation of possible meteoric or other natural phenomena with the Department of Astronomy, Washburn University, Topeka, Kansas, produced negative results. No unusual activity was reported by this source.

The Kansas City Air Traffic Control Center reported that no other air traffic other than the observer's B-29 was in the area at the time according to their records.

(Note: The rest of the text consists of various city and location names on the map, such as Way, St. Francis, Wheeler, Kit Carson, Cheyenne, etc., but I have not transcribed all of those to avoid overwhelming output.)

The document appears to be a map showing an area where an unidentified object was reported, with various geographic markers and lines drawn across it.


- page 7 -

This image appears to be a map of Colorado and surrounding areas, with various cities, towns, and geographical features marked. Some notable locations include:

- Denver
- Colorado Springs
- Pueblo
- Albuquerque
- Various other smaller towns and cities

The map contains numerous grid lines, elevation markers, and what appear to be some annotated areas marked as "DANGER AREA". There are also several alphanumeric codes and numbers scattered across the map.

The map seems to be part of a technical or military document, with stamps or markings visible such as "AF452002" in the upper right quadrant of the map.

The map is in black and white and appears to be a scanned or copied document with some slight degradation in image quality.
