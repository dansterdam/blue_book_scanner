SYNOPSIS: Lt. Colonel L. S. Goll, U.S.A.F., Dover AFB, Delaware, reported the following observation of an unidentified flying object near Goodland, Kansas, on 5 May 1952:

The following observations of an unidentified flying object was reported to the Directorate of Intelligence, USAF, concerning an incident on 5 May 1952, approximately 3:15 p.m.:

The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes. It appeared to be flying at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet, moving in a northerly direction. The object was silver in color and circular in shape, about the size of a C-47 aircraft. No vapor trail or exhaust was visible. The object moved at a high rate of speed, approximately 1,000 mph. It appeared to be completely silent. The object was not picked up by the Goodland radar.

Investigation of possible meteors or other natural phenomena with the Department of the Air Force revealed no other observations of this nature. No other air traffic, other than the observer's B-29, was in the area at the time according to their records.
