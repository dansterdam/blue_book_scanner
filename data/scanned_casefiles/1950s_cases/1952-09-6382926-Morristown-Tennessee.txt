30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

I feel almost certain that this object was not an aircraft - or at least not an aircraft as I know them.

I feel almost certain that the object was not a large object or single object, or other object in that might be in common up by the surface of the city, during the object that the large point cloud or point illumination of the city and on out over the dark desert, as when I saw it once the city.

It is hard for me to estimate the size, I shall not positively estimate how far it was from me. If the object was 1/4 mile away I would roughly estimate its size as being about 250 feet. Say 100 ft. and about 10 ft. thick, although the latter would be much shorter to estimate and I could be considerably off on this.

I feel sure the object was not shown up by the reflected sunlight says, means of light time of night.

INTRODUCTION

1. A letter, dated 8 Oct 52, enclosure 1, containing information on a flying
object arrived at this headquarters on 10 Oct 52 via ordinary mail. Subject letter
was addressed to: Intelligence Officer, Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino, Calif.
From a confidential the following return address: 520 D Street, Modesto, California.
The source of the letter as derived from the return address and signature was D. E.
Little, hereinafter referred to as SOURCE. SOURCE reliability is unknown and truth
of report cannot be judged.

GENERAL

2. SOURCE was sitting on the front porch of his home, "Woodlees,"
California, about 1520 PST, 7 September 1952, when he noticed a single object moving
slowly across the south, and he immediately called the attention of his wife to
same.

3. SOURCE and wife agree that the flying object was of a design as indicated
by the facsimile sketch attached as inclosure 2, i.e., a delta wing type aircraft.
SOURCE writes that the aerial performance of the object was similar to that of a
delta wing aircraft and that the flying object made no noise and maintained a steady
course. SOURCE writes that approximately 15 seconds elapsed from the time he initially observed the flying object until it passed beyond some trees which interrupted
his line of sight.

4. SOURCE initially writes that he could not determine the flying object's
speed, or distance, but feels that it was at least one (1) mile away. SOURCE then
writes that in the event the flying object was one (1) mile to the East of his position, he would estimate it to be flying at an altitude of 2,000 feet at 100-125 mph,
and its width approximately 200 feet. SOURCE states that it would be difficult to
estimate the thickness of the flying object as he and his wife could not see it
clearly at anytime.

5. SOURCE writes that the flying object was light in color and seemed to have
a dull glow or slight luminescence. SOURCE feels that the object's color or luminous
appearance was not a result of reflected light from the city as it maintained its
color or luminous appearance after passing over the city onto the desert. SOURCE
writes that there were no clouds in the vicinity and that the moon did not rise for
another hour. SOURCE further writes that he has ruled out the possibility that the
unidentified object could have been a large flock of ducks or other birds because of
the above.

6. SOURCE writes that he has ruled out the possibility that the unidentified
object could have been a conventional aircraft as he is familiar with same, and believes that the only explanation for the unidentified object would be some atmospheric condition which formed a cloud-like shape that traveled in a direction opposite
to the light prevailing breeze. SOURCE writes that such existence, however, would
not explain the dull glow that made the object visible on a dark night.

7. SOURCE writes that he feels his information on his sighting will be value,
but that he has explained the matter to the best of his ability under the circum-
stances. SOURCE writes that he has reported this sighting to substantiate other pos-
sible reports of the same, that he felt it his duty as a citizen to render such report,

11. A report of air traffic in the vicinity of Needles, California at the time
of this sighting has not been obtained.

Subject: Unidentified Object

Last night while sitting on my front porch at Needles, about 9:30 PM, I noticed an object moving from north to south and immediately called the attention of my wife to it. I have no way of knowing its size, speed, nor how far away it was, but I feel - rather sure, it was at least a mile away and probably farther.

My wife and I agree that it was this shape:
[A hand-drawn sketch of a delta-like shape]

Direction of Travel ↑

In other words it was on the order of a delta type craft and moved thru the air like the above type does. It made no noise and kept on a steady course. I estimate that from the time I first saw it, until it was hidden from view by some tall trees, about 15 seconds elapsed.

In the event this object was a mile to the east of where I was, I might roughly estimate that it was at an altitude of 2,000 ft. and was going about 100 - 125 miles per hour and its width about 200 ft. I would be hard to estimate its thickness, because we could not, at any time, see it very clearly.

This matter was light in color and seemed to glow a very dull glow, or was by some phenomenon slightly luminous itself.

I feel rather certain that the object was not lit up by the lights of the city, because it was just the same dull intensity after it had passed over the city and continued on over the desert. There were no clouds in the immediate vicinity, and it was fully an hour or more before the moon came up.

I have ruled out the possibility that it might have been a large flock of ducks or other birds because of the above.

I also have ruled out the possibility of its being a conventional aircraft, as I know them anyway, at least.

The only thing I can think it might have been was an atmospheric condition forming a cloud-like shape and sending it in a direction almost opposite the light prevailing breeze that was moving at that time.

Subj: Flying Object (Verbatim copy) (continued)

Of course this does not explain the dull glow that made it be seen on the dark night, so I guess I will just keep on guessing and wondering.

All the foregoing will seem rather vague, I am sure, but I am merely explaining the matter the best I can under the rather vague circumstances.

It is possible others saw this and have reported it and if so, it would seem the more reports that come in would help you on the subject that much more.

I am merely trying to be a good citizen in reporting the above and should you have any questions on this subject I will be glad to try to answer them to the best of my knowledge and ability.
