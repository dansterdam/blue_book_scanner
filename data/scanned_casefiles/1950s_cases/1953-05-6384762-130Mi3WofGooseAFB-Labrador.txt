AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Place: Goose Air Base, Labrador                                    FROM: Dist/Int, MFAG
Date of Information: 2 May 1953                                   EVALUATION: B-3
Date of Report: 2 May 1953

BY: NATHAN J. LEVERSON, Captain, USAF                             107th AGW Squadron,
                                                                  Goose Air Base, Labrador

SUMMARY:

1. The pilot of Maritime Central Airways-64 aircraft observed an unidentified object 130 miles southwest of Goose Air Base 2 May 1953 at 0825Z.

2. Statement of Second Lieutenant H. L. Brown, 107th AGW Squadron:

"At 0C/O-252 the Tower gave me the following information by land line telephone: Pilot Warden of MCA-64, sighted a luminous object, size unknown. Object was sighted 550 East off the starboard wing, object stayed alongside aircraft three or four minutes. Then plunged, object rapidly and last known location. Another soon sighted object was sighted directly in front of the first object. When Shaped."

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. No other aircraft were in the area at the time of sighting. It therefore appears that this incident represents an aerial object caused by either a meteorological phenomenon or some physical observation, such as reflection from the aircraft.

2. Lack of sufficient information precludes the possibility of concrete evaluation or thorough analysis of the incident.

3. This information is of interest to Air Technical Intelligence Center, ATTN: ATIAC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.

ENCLOSURE NO. 726 - Goose Bay, Labrador

At 0305t and at 0825t on 2 May 1953 two unidentified objects were observed from Goose Bay area. The first consisted of a sighting of an unidentified light by an F-94 under CAVU conditions. As the F-94 gave chase, the light ran it. A similar object, believed to be the same one and the F-94), sighted, was reported from the Goose Bay tower and described as point a "terrific rate of speed". According to the source, the light was probably an unidentified a/c.

The second observation was also from the air, when the pilot and copilot of a commercial airlines reported sighting two luminous objects approximately 500' off the right wing of their a/c. The plane was located 130 miles SE of Goose Bay at the time of sighting.
