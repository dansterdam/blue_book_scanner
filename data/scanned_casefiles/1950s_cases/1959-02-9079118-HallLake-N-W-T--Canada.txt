AT 1345Z 09 FEB 59, AN OBSERVER AT WEST MELVILLE, ANOTHER AT ROWLEY
AND TWO OBSERVERS AT HALL LAKE, ALL IN THE NORTH WEST
TERRITORIES WERE ATTRACTED BY A VERY BRIGHT WHITE FLASH IN THE
SKY. THE INITIAL FLASH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FOURTY DEGREES ABOVE
THE HORIZON AND FROM TWENTY TO SIXTY MILES NORTH OF THE OBSERVERS.
THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF THE FLASH THEN DECREASED SLIGHTLY AND
AN OBJECT ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASEBALL HELD AT ARMS LENGTH.

PAGE FIVE DE RJEDMBA 2373 INCOMING
RESEMBLING A MAGNESIUM FLARE, CONTINUED IN A DOWNWARD ARC
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. AFTER ABOUT TEN SECONDS THIS ABJECT
INCREASED NOTICEABLY IN BRIGHTNESS AND THEN COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED
ABOUT FIFTEEN DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. A WHITISH VAPOROUS
TRAIL LASTING ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE POINTS
OF THE INITIAL AND SECOND FLASH. THIS TRAIL WAS SAID TO RESEMBLE THAT
LEFT BY A JET AIRCRAFT BUT TO BE CONSIDERABLE LESS DENSE.
ALTHOUGH INITIALLY A SOLID TRAIL IT BROKE UP INTO THREE SECTIONS IN
A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SLOWLY DISSIPATED.
TWO MORE OBSERVERS AT HALL LAKE AND ONE MORE AT WEST MELVILLE
WITNESSED THE PHENOMENON SHORTLY AFTER THE INITIAL FLASH BUT
DID NOT NOT ACTUALLY SEE THE INITIAL FLASH. THEIR ATTENTION WAS
PROBABLY ATTRACTED TO THE OBJECT BY THEIR SECOND FLASH. THEIR
REPORTS WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL THE OTHER OBSERVERS.
ALTHOUGH THESE VARIOUS OBSERVERS WERE WIDELY SEPARATED THERE IS A
REMARKABLE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE OBSERVATIONS WITH ONLY MINOR
VARIATIONS HEIGHT AND DISTANCE ESTIMATES. I AM OF THE OPINION
THAT THIS WAS A GENUINE SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING
OBJECT, WITH A VERY STRONG POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING THE ENTRY OF A
METEORITY INTO THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

THE INTENSE WHITE COLOR OF THE OBJECT, THE APPARENT VELOCITY,
THE RESULTANT VAPOR TRAIL THE DOWNWARD ARC OF THE FLIGHT PATH
AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ANY NOISE OR VIBRATION WOULD APPEAR
TO BEAR THIS OUT. THE POSSIBILITY HOWEVER DOES EXISTS THAT THIS
PHENOMENON WAS THE RE-ENTRY OF SOME TYPE MISSILE INTO THE EARTHS
ATMOSPHERE.
