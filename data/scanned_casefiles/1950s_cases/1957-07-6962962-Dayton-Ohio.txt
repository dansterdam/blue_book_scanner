18. July 1956

Dear Colonel Spaulding,

Further to my letter of June 13th, 1956, I am pleased to inform you that we have at last tracked down the owner of the photograph of the "alleged UFO".

I am sorry to say that the photograph was not examined satisfactorily by the then editor of the Flying Saucer Review at the time when it was first launched in the world. Enquiries instituted by our Mr. Creighton have revealed the fact that the photograph is a hoax. We had only recently heard rumours to this effect, but were unable at first to confirm this information. Now, I am happy to say, we have obtained a written "confession" from the perpetrator, Mr. Z. Pogl. I append the relevant extract from his letter:

"The faked UFO was made at sea. I used two plastic cones, for model airplanes, 4" dia. and stuck them together. A few alterations and a good high gloss silver paint did the rest. I used a yellow filter and a F 3.5 lens. Thus - no sign of a fine white base."

Mr. Creighton goes on to say that:

"His full name is either Z.T. or Z.D. Pogl (I cannot read his signature), and his present address is: 6, Broadway, Hutfield, Herts."

... / I propose to

Directors: G.A. Bowers (Editor)   G.W. Creighton   D.G. Dempster   C.H. Gibbs-Smith   The Hon. Brinsley le Poer Trench

I propose to publish an exposure of this hoax in a future issue of the review. I can assure you I feel a little disturbed by the affair, as nowadays one can be so very careful with all photographs. If we publish them at all, we do not make extravagant claims about them.

Yours, sincerely,
Charles Bowen,
Editor.

P.S. I have marked this letter confirming in view of my remark in the first sentence of the second paragraph.

The sketch bears a striking resemblance to UFO photographs from a Navy UFO photograph taken off California in 1957. Note the formation, running lights and antennae. The rough exterior of the object in the photo appears to jive with the description Mamone and his 19-year-old son gave police: "It was rough and pitted all over like coral rock."

CSI OFFICER SEES UFO

July 2, 1957: On this day a UFO was observed by CSI's Organizational Vice President, late George in northern New York. Harold had just been taking some ribbing from his companions about his saucer interests, when Lita exclaimed, "My God, what's that?" Harold could not have said it better. It was a white-luminous ellipse about an eighth the size of the full moon, and three or four times as bright as Jupiter, was moving in a clear sky over Black Mountain in the east-northeast. The object was emphatic about the luminosity; the glow could not have been reflected sunlight, which would have been yellow; (A plane, reflecting a brilliant golden gleam, had passed in the eastern sky a few minutes before.) The ellipse, horizontally oriented, was moving slowly southward (toward the observers' right). One of the witnesses noted a halting or jerky type of motion. After a few seconds in a fruitless effort to find his camera (which, when found, was not loaded anyway). He did, however, see enough to feel sure that the object was not a symmetrical egg-shape, but a thick disc or flattened spheroid (like a white tire thrown the hole in the center) seen not quite from edge-on. The object was not fuzzy; its contours were well-defined. Moving deliberately southwest, it appeared to make a turn toward the east. It was gradually dwindled in size until it was lost in the "afterglow". It had been in view for four minutes by the observers' watches. It could not have been a balloon, an aircraft, or an astronomical object. It would seem to be comparable to the UFOs filmed by and seen in the movie "U.F.O."

                                                                Lake George, New York

July 2, 1957: About 4 p.m. on the same day that CSI vice-president, sighted a UFO at Lake George, New York (see N.L. #8), another interesting observation was taking place nearer home-in Teaneck, New Jersey. Mrs. 12-year-old son Robert, and his 12-year-old friend Richard Levine, saw a brilliantly shining UFO of peculiar shape—"like a kettledrum." In the course of a long phone conversation with the Research Director, Mrs. confirmed the similarity of the object's shape to that of a kettledrum—round on the bottom, flat on top.

When Mrs. and the boys first noticed it, the "flying kettledrum" was east of their position and apparently somewhat south of the George Washington Bridge. (They live about three miles west of the Hudson River, and a few blocks north of the bridge.) The object, at an elevation of at least 50 degrees, was moving rapidly and silently in a northerly direction ("toward Tenafly") in a straight, smooth trajectory. It left no trail. In angular size, it exceeded the full moon—so confusion with a conventional aircraft is out of the question. The edges were sharp and clearly defined, and the object had a decidedly "solid" appearance. Its color was brilliantly metallic, appearing practically like highly polished chrome plate. No windows, openings or protrusions of any sort were to be seen—the surface was "just an unmarred shine."

But as it proceeded northward, its shiny finish abruptly turned to a dull, cloud-like, grayish-white color. Its head had a distinct impression that this change occurred within the surface of the object itself, and was not due to sunlight reflecting off it. The sky was moderately overcast, although the sun was shining at the time. The object did not pass in front of, or behind, any clouds. It gradually diminished in size and disappeared from view in a northerly direction, without changing course or losing altitude. It was in view for no less than ten seconds, and no more than twenty.

The incident first appeared in the Bergen Evening Record, July 3rd. Mrs. had requested the reporter who took her story to advise her of any corroborating reports; he called later and told her there had been none.

Campos, Rio State, Brazil

UFO Follows
Brazilian Airliner

On July 4, 1957, a circular, lighted object paced a B.R.A.L. Airlines plane from Campos, Rio State, Brazil, almost to Victoria, the Capital of the Espirito Santo State. This is approximately 230 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro.

Reported by the plane's pilot, Caporal Da Costa, the object was also watched by his co-pilot, radio operator, stewardess, and members of his passenger.

The UFO followed the airliner for several minutes, sometimes speeding up to fly in front of the plane.

The object was circular with up and down parts according to Caporal Da Costa's report in the newspaper "Folha de Manha" published in Sao Paulo. Whether this is referred to a usual loose clear. One unique aspect of the sighting was that when the plane and the object went through clouds, little windows were lighted, emitting a very strong light, which was put out immediately when the object came out from the clouds.

NICAP is checking this report with the Brazilian government and the airline for further details about the mysterious object.

We are indebted to Brazilian correspondent Paulo Gibeiro da Rocha Neves of Sao Paulo for this information.

                                                    Rio Doce, Brazil (about 100 km in coast)

SEEN FROM THE AIR

Captain Tulio Ramos Ribeiro of Cruzeiro do Sul Airlines has sent us an account
of his sighting over the radio-active "hot" strip in Brazilian Southern Coast. It
may be significant that most of the UFOs seen from the air, are spotted over the
area marked on the map below. Why daddy?

"On July 14 1957 at 17:50 6 clock local time (20:50 GMT) we were flying the
convair PP-VDI, 4,700 meters high, magnetic heading 235, near Rio Doce, about
100 kilometers from the coast, when my co-pilot called our attention to a strange
luminosity ahead of our plane, a little to the left and on a slightly higher
level.

"The light was white and its intensity was something none of us had seen before. It
grew rapidly in size and when it was at an estimated 20 kilometers from us, it
made a 90 degrees sharp, very sharp turn to the left and flew toward the coast. At
the moment it changed its course were able to clearly see that it was some sort of
cigar-shaped form, thicker in the middle than any cigar. It was totally white as
though it were made of aluminum.

Then we saw that the white lumino-sity was ahead of the body or in the front part
of it. It could be compared to water kened by the keel of a fast moving motor-boat
you know, that thing we call "mutachoe" only instead of water, the spray was
luminous. Behind the body we could see crangs, red and blue colors changing
in quick succession. The speed was "enviable" and we had the stranger in sight
for 10 or 15 seconds. The flight was horizontal all the time; the day was clear and
no stars were visible at the time."

July 10, 1957 (both of Heppner, Oregon, were piling brush near Crawford Springs (nine miles out of Bull Prairie) at 12:10 p.m. when they saw a round, hat-shaped object moving rapidly toward the northwest at "terrific speed." They estimated its size as about "half that of a forest service Porter Wagon Truck," and described it as brown in color, "similar to dried pine needles." Traveling in straight level flight at an estimated altitude of 3000 feet, the object left no trail and had no visible means of propulsion.

However, the two men said it made a sound "something like a jet plane, only with a very noticeable whistle." As it disappeared from view, it made a sound described as a sort of "plup," similar to the sound of a bullet striking water.

They viewed it for ten seconds. The men immediately reported the incident to the Madison Butte Lookout high in the Blue Mountains, southeast of Heppner.

(The "hat-shape" is reminiscent of the Twin Falls, Idaho report of Aug. 13, 1957 (Blue Book file, p. 23); and the Whittier, Calif. report of August 22, 1957 (see following page). The brown color is very unusual.) -- Heppner Gazette-Times, 7/11.
