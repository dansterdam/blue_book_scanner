could not close in on it. 2-3 days
later a photograph of a fuzzy white 1i
light was taken purporting to be the
same object.

This PI Report has been written to fulfill a request submitted by Captain George Gregory
AFOIN 1846 concerning analysis of UFO Photography.

1. After detailed review of IR 2-58 and three attached photos. It is apparent that
discrepancies exist in the data presented.

The image measurements on the respective photos were as follows:
                Length (mm)     Width (mm)
P-21142            3.10            .05
P-21143            1.05            .11
P-21144            1.70            .11

These image dimensions when produced by 105mm lens dictates the angles subtended
by the traces of the objects in space. They are as follows:
                Length (mm)
P-21142            3.10            10 - 41' - 26"
P-21143            1.05            00 - 34' - 20"
P-21144            1.70            00 - 55' - 38"

2. Using the given speed of 310K or 5.94 m/min and the limits of exposure times of
1 and 4 min the images shown could only have been produced by the item being at
the respective ranges.

                (1 min)           (4 min)
P-21142            201 ml           805 ml
P-21143            595 ml          2379 ml
P-21144            367 ml          1469 ml

Some foreshortening of the image would occur if the trace and lens axis intersected
at an angle other than 90°, the extent is not determinable from the data given.

3. The following is a list of the latitudes and longitudes for various sightings, and the time of each. The eighth sighting in this list contains only latitude.

[A table follows with columns for Position (Latitude, Longitude), Time, Δ Position, Δ Time (min), Average Velocity (miles/MPH)]

The table contains multiple rows with latitude and longitude coordinates ranging from 41° to 43° North, and 139° to 140° East, with various times and velocities.

The above positions were plotted and time between noted. The relation between geodetic and geographic coordinates were noted and the corresponding distances between computed, computer values were of distances and time average speeds were computed. The mean of these average speeds was 1262 mi/hr or a value not consistent with that reported 310K to compute range. The range could be increased by a factor of more than two. Thus making the situation more improbable.

4. The location of the observation stations and the heading and elevation angles during sighting and exposures were not included, this data is of prime importance in relating photos to other supporting data.

Likewise, nothing was stated concerning type of film used or development it received. The photo images did not agree as closely as would be expected to the operators mentioned; however, nothing definite can be ascertained because of the lack of data.

Conclusion: From the above analysis it is shown that considerable contradiction in results are the direct effect of inconsonant data. Unless the points in question regarding the data can be resolved no worthwhile interpretation can be made.

1. This report is not sufficiently documented to enable a reasonable radar evaluation to be made. Obviously, photos of an object "thought to be the same object" in several visually and on radar two days earlier are no of value.

2. However, based on the above, end considering the number of people who observed the object(s) visually and on radar, there is no solid factual data to indicate just what these people did see. The erratic movements of the targets on the scope of course sound like anomalous propagation but this does not explain the visual sightings. This report appears to fall in the category of those incidents which cannot be satisfactorily explained.

1. Photographs attached to UFO report from 848th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron have been examined and the following analysis made from a photographic report:

    a. Object photographed was a stationary light of some type and could be anything from a light bulb to a moonlit a moon or star. It is not likely because with an exposure of 45 seconds, there would be subject movement resulting in a streak.

    b. There is no similarity between the one print and the other 3 which are the same and it is doubtful that they are of the same object.

2. Any further photographic analysis of these photos would require negative and information on camera used, etc.

1. As requested, prints from attached film strip have been made and are enclosed.
   The film strip is a color positive and the prints are in black and white negative form.

2. From a photographic analysis of the prints, the following facts are evident:

   a. Exposure was definitely a time exposure made of a moving illuminated
      object.

   b. The difference in length of exposed streaks on prints is due to length
      of exposure and the speed of object traveled during the exposure.

   c. The different width of objects in the three prints is due to the amount
      of halation on film caused by the intensity of light striking it. This, in turn, was
      controlled by the use of different aperture settings as stated in data sheet.

   d. Normally with an exposure made into the sky at time these photos were
      made, the stars will also appear as light streaks similar to the object. An overcast
      sky would prevent this but it would also prevent a planet from appearing.

STATEMENT
                                                                16 December 1957

SUBJECT: Report of Sighting And Attempted Intercept of UFO

1. Approximately 0845½ 12 December 1957, I left the mess hall to return to my BOQ. When passing the NCO barracks Sgt. Dickerson asked if I had seen the object. I with to the window in the messway and noticed what at first glance seemed to be a very bright light directly to the west and level with the F3 tower. Object seemed to have a slight bobbing motion to it but no movement as to lateral displacement. I watched the object for thirty (30) seconds then called operations hill and requested that the senior director initiate a scramble through CG.

The senior director has informed me that they were pointing the object on HRI. I immediately proceeded to operations. Upon reaching the top of the mill I again sighted the object. The object was located to the S3W and seemed to be stationary except for the bobbing motion. I went into operations and observed a definite blip well defined. The blip was stationary at first as if in orbit. This blip at the time was approximately 60 miles from the station. Again went outside for a visual check and noticed that the object had moved approximately ten (10) degrees to the west. This movement was determined by a fix I had just visual. I again went into operations and monitored the HRI. The object commenced to move and I timed it for one minute and established a speed of approximately 300 knots. I then timed it for another minute and the object was again located by this time "moving real" near time 1630, had been scrambled from Misawa, and I took control of them and vectored them to the area of the object. The object faded from our radar at 0925½. At this time interceptors were still JQ miles from target. I continued to vector the aircraft to the last known position, but no visual contact was established. A position was given by Pearl driver (another radar station) was sourced. Of Plug, Hilo) which proved to be an erroneous report. The only intense light that the pilots reported apparently stemmed from the plane's venus.

2. The time between my first sighting the object and vectoring aircraft for landing was from 1745 to 1107½ 12 December 1957.

3. I very definitely feel that the object I saw visually was not a star or planet. Plus being very brilliant it seemed to radiate small orange or red pinpoints of light from underneath.

4. Shortly after the contact lost by our radar equipment it was established that the radar had become inoperative due to a bad crystal. This could have caused the fade.

Statement Concerning the UFO Sighted by this station (Plight-45)
Time: Approximately 1745-1850 I with personnel visual sighting at
1800 I or 0900Z.
Date: 12 December 1957.

Charlie Crew reported for evening shift 16:30 at 17:45 Lt. Wright
was called outside by one of the airmen to observe a very bright light
in the Southwestern sky. At approximately the same time this station was
contacted by SITE 13 to ascertain if we had a local visual on the light.
At this time I checked the PPI and HRI for any pickup. I immediately
picked up a blip on the HRI as follows: alt. 19,400 ft., Range 110 miles.
There was no PPI pickup at all. I turned the the upper data and reported
the above information to Lt. Short, the Senior Director on duty. Immediately I turned again to check the object and found it had already moved
into a range of ninety (90) miles in this short time. I next estimated
the speed of the object to be between 500 and 600 knots. For the remainder of the time we carried the object at approximately 550 knots
while it seemed to be pulling stalls while changing altitude up or down
eratically.

At 1745I I was able to get outside operations to view the object.
At first visual sighting I judged the object to be SSW of this station.
I did not get the immediate impression that the object was a star for
the following reasons: (1) It seemed much too close, (2) To the naked
eye it cast off a white light not at all hazy or with any bluish haze,
(3) It looked much like a round auto headlamp in the rapidstance, (4)
The object seemed to have a very white glow yet seemed to remain quite
distinct to the eye. At first, with the naked eye no movement was
apparent. I then viewed the object through 7X50 Binoculars. It was just
above a red light on a distant mountain Southwest of this station.
Immediately the object seemed to move toward the East, from my right to
left. I then placed the glasses on a steady support three different
times to assure myself of this movement. At a later time the object
seemed to move in the opposite direction (Westward) until it finally
faded from view of other observers. I think that the overlay, flight
pattern later made up from plots on the object will verify the above.
As I sighted the object through the binoculars at exactly 1800 I saw
the following:

Glowing White Body-                                   Three Yellow arms-
                                                       very distinct without
                                                       tapering or having any
Reddish-Orange flamlike color                          sort of attachments.
emitted from the rear of the object
as it moved.

The white body and yellow arms (5) were quite distinct in shape and color.
The reddish-Orange glow from the apparent rear of the object seemed to

change shape and length and had the appearance of a jet or rocket blast.
For some few seconds the object seemed to have a reddish cast surrounding
it, but I believe this was inside in the focusing of the binocular lens
rather than the object itself.

At exactly 1803I I returned to the Senior Director dais in operations
and drew a picture as presented above. I thought that my own first impressions should be recorded immediately before talking about the object
with others who saw it. From this time (0805I) I remained at the Senior
Directors desk until the object faded on the Plught HRI and visually
outside. I recorded the facts of range, altitude, azimuth, etc. of the
object as related by the crew chief, SSgt. Nyrick, and other facts and
times of actions concerning the object as they happened, all of which
were submitted immediately following the incident.

STATEMENT

16 December 1957

The UFO which appeared SSW of Asoiyayama on the 12th of December, 0845Z, appeared at first glance to be a bright star. I watched the object four times for periods of about three minutes each. The first two times I saw it, the intensity of light was very bright. The last two times, the glow was not quite as bright. (My sightings were at approximately 0855Z, 0910Z, 0942Z, and 0950Z.) I viewed it with a pair of 7X50 binoculars as well as the naked eye.

The object's form was oval, almost circular. The intensity of light seemed the same all over the oval form, but the left side glowed with rays of light much brighter than the right side. There were three long steady arms of light extending from the left side. These were from two to three times larger and longer than the other rays, and were the most distinct things about the object. At times there appeared to be a double or triple image. This could have been caused by the binoculars. The most distinct second image and the only one visible with the naked eye was below the oval form giving a shadow effect. This second image was more of a red color (very light) than the oval form which was a white light. The object had no other distinct characteristics during the time I saw it.

16 December 1957

A2C Davidson requested that I bring the binoculars and accompany him to view an object reported by Lone Wolf to this site. When I first viewed the object of concern it appeared to be a star except for the exceptional brightness of the object and the unusual way it glowed. The object appeared to be directly over a certain light on a distant mountain (approx. 2209 or 2300 in reference to Chart) and seemed to leave a definite path of light through the sky although very indefinable due to the glow completely surrounding the object. The object never went more than approximately 2300 or 2400 from Plughat. The object reached its maximum and size at approximately 09302. At this same time a message was relayed to me that the object had turned from the station. From the time the object turned away until it had faded completely it diminished in both size and brightness very rapidly. The object was reported to have been varying relative mainly thousands of feet, but I could not observe visually any change in the objects location (azimuth or altitude) except by its position relative to certain lights and landmarks observed by myself. The object faded my statement approximately two minutes before the glow could no longer be observed. I lost complete visual contact with the object at 09522, 12 December 1957.

I feel quite confident that what I observed to be the star in the sky on my way to work tonight (0730Z, 12 December 1957), in the same general direction from Plughat as the above mentioned object, was the above mentioned object already very distant in the sky but not nearly so noticeable since it was still light and there was no glow distinguishable.

At approximately 1430N, 12 December, my attention was called to an illuminated object. Southwest of this station. It was a circular object and looked like a landing light of an aircraft, except it seemed distant and extremely bright. The object's illumination seemed to fluctuate. I observed the phenomenon until approximately 1930 at which time 1930 seemed to be moving West Southwest and illumination decreasing in intensity.

16 December 1957

At approximately 1310I, 12 December 1957, MSgt. Dickerson called me by telephone in my barracks (building T-10) informing me of the existence of "something" in the sky and requesting I attempt to get a picture of the object. I personally sighted the object a few minutes later while standing in front of the mess hall. At my first observation I noted a light of brilliant intensity at approximately 45 degrees from my position (using 90 degrees as directly overhead). The object seemed to have about the same intensity as that of burning magnesium. I felt that I could discern movement like that of a huge pendulum; however I was unable to time a definite pendulum swing. The object approached the size of a large grapefruit. There were stars in the area of the object and I noted nothing unusual about them. The object appeared to me to be over the Sea of Japan near Ichikawa Bay. I observed the object from behind building T-21, from behind building T-25, and in the POL area on receiving hill. During these observations I noted that the object was becoming lower on the horizon and that the intensity of the object was not so great as when I originally sighted the object. I was unable to draw any realistic conclusions from my observations as to what or where the object was. My camera was inoperative during the entire period.

10 December 1957

At approximately 1800 I saw a very bright object in the sky southwest of this station. After I had watched the object for a while, I went into near operations and saw very soon an attitude in a "pick up" object. We were unable to get a return on our search equipment, but a "paint" was observed on the height finding equipment. I then initiated a check of USAF bases and operations, however, and were unable to determine the possibility of friendly aircraft in the area of our radar return; none of these agencies had aircraft in the area.

The object was continuously tracked with the AHI. The object's speed ranged from 550 to 700 knots. Altitude checks were made every minute. The object seemed to be "pulling stalls" or orbiting the then recovering at high speeds. During the study, the object was over four to five thousand feet.

Lastly, again, went outside, and the object seemed dimmer. It was the most unusual object I have ever seen. It appears round, or egg shape with tints of red extending outward from it; it was reddish looking at one end like a jet with after burner on.

I have never seen a star as large as the object. I have never seen a star present on him. The fighters were south of the position of the object.

STATEMENT

16 December 1957

On the 12th of December 1957 at approximately 1815 hours I witnessed an object in the sky. An object to which I have never seen reference. To the best of my knowledge I can honestly say that it was artificially lit and controlled by some means of a nuclear device.

The best description I can give is that it was a ball, so to speak, of a highly illuminated and also dull light of the color white.

The appearance of the object was there and there for a definite purpose and I can honestly and truthfully say it wasn't any hallucination of any kind. This evening at approximately 1700 hours 15 December 1957 the object appeared again and I witnessed this same object from the camp site and once again it made the same appearance.

My opinion of the object is definitely controlled by man due to the tactical approach and dispersement.

The night of December 12 someone came into operations and said that there was a strange bright light in the sky. They said it looked like a bright star. When I went out to look at it, I admit it did-look like a star. The light was very bright and very high. It was south west of our station. Someone must have gotten the bright idea to turn our HF antenna in that direction because we did have something pointing at that azimuth. I don't remember the range and azimuth at the time the first picked it up, but its closest range was about forty miles and its lowest altitude was about twelve thousand feet. Its speed was terrible. Since it was constantly orbiting, we could get no definite speed. On the HF light movements were orbiting to and from this station, up and down in altitude, and north and south from about 220 degrees to about 320 degrees. Later when I went out to look at the light, it looked dimmer. Fighters were scrambled on it. When they got close to it they were supposed to have said it disappeared.

Lt. Wright and I saw the object at about the same time, approximately 1750L, 12 December 1957. It was very easy to see without the aid of binoculars and was about three (3) times brighter than the brightest star. It was approximately at an angle (10) degrees up from us. I looked at it through the binoculars and it appeared to be round with a very brilliant glow all around it. It seemed to be closer than any star in the sky and quite stationary. In position it was observed moving in a northern direction and tracking approximately North Northwest. I observed it for about ten (10) minutes and intermittently from when on until it disappeared at approximately 1845L. All the time I observed this object its glow did not change in intensity until it began to fade about the last fifteen minutes. It appeared to be round and white in color.

On 16 December 1957 at approximately 0110 16th, I observed a bright light in the sky. At was southwest of this station. To the eye, it appeared to be a star, only it was several times brighter and much larger. When observed through a field glasses, it gave the impression of being several bright lights. At this time movement could be detected. From the right side of the glasses to the left was the pattern of movement.

The UFO was 1/4 inch at 30 inches on our drawing. Direction obtained was east; speed-500 knots; measured altitude- 21,000 feet; scope presentation-small aircraft.

A flight of aircraft, Nugget 44, was approximately Chitose, Chitose; it was diverted to the UFO. The UFO turned in the opposite direction and finally broke off due to fuel shortage. Nugget 44 was 45 miles from this station.

Two subway news were scrambled. At no time could the subways come within one hundred miles of the UFO. All we can say is we were still in visual contact with my other aircraft. I feel this indicates airborne radar with a range of over 100 miles.

During another run, the altitude changed from 21,000 feet to 14,000 feet with an unusual rate of descent. Its last measured altitude was 19,000 feet. The speed was a little better than 500 knots, and it was increasing.

Approximately 10% miles from the station the UFO was joined with another similar object. The second object was detected 15 miles from the site. The two objects then faded from our radar.

STATEMENT

16 December 1957

My first impression of the UFO was that it was from the Southwest. It appeared to be in some kind of an orbit moving West and then to the East. It was a Whitish color and quite bright. When I first saw it quite close. After visual contact I went to the HRI and picked up a blip flying between 12 and 21 thousand feet. Returning for a second visual I found the object to be dimming and moving in a Westerly direction.

We were working as usual on our 4:30 to twelve shift on the night of December 12. Things were going on normally when all of the sudden there was an increased amount of commotion. I was pulling scope at the time and didn't know at first what was going on. Everyone seemed to be rushing outside. I had someone to relieve me so I could find out what was going on.

When I got outside there was a fairly brilliant white light in the sky. It was too close and too bright to look at. I almost looked at it for a couple of minutes I came inside and began tracking it on the scope. From the way it appeared on the scope its amount of acceleration was tremendous.

It varied altitude at almost every move. At the time I computed its speed at better than 700 miles per hour. Then when the fighters scrambled on it and got within a radius of about 70 miles, it just vanished. I might add that I wasn't a reflection of any clouds because there were no clouds in the sky.

REMARKS: Site P-45 assumed control of Subway Red at 0922Z and immediately
was vectored toward the object. P-45 was painting the object by the Height
Range Indicator and visually. Subway Red reported he had a visual on the
object at 09992 but lost it almost simultaneously. At 09552 the aircraft
reported a visual on a bright object off their port wing, but wasn't moving.
In the meantime, site P-45 had lost contact, both visually and electronically
with the object and Subway Red was told to anchor his position. (Site 29)
advised they were observing the object at a bearing of 240°, 110 miles from
Site 45. Subway Red was vectored immediately 230°, and obtained another
visual, but the object wasn't moving literally, but vertically. The aircraft
lost the object and were broken off at 11:02Z. Later, Site 29 reported that
the object they were observing was a reciprocal.

MEMO ROUTING SLIP

[Blank routing slip with empty fields]

REMARKS:
For Ev. Ext. Record:
Comment: All observers who gave a direction of the object stated it was located generally in the Southwest. Very little if any movement. This is about the exact position of VENUS at the time and place from Pilots who was fixed stated that the intense bright was dark. Radar analysis discloses that the attempt to make a positive correlation was not entirely satisfactory. The radar sight was marked "uncertain".
