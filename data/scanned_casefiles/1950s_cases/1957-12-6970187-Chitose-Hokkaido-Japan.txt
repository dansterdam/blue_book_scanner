SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112 

5TH AF ATOLLO
6 December 1957, an unidentified object was observed over the sea to the west of the southern tip of Hokkaido, Japan.

1. The object was described as a bright bluish-white light, circular in shape. Color was reported as greenish-white, changing to yellow or white with orange color.

2. The object was under visual observation for a period of one hour, twenty-five minutes. It was reported to be stationary for a period of twenty-five minutes, then it started to move erratically with a zig-zag pattern. Its estimated height or ceiling was 10,000 feet and speed 210 knots. Track was irregular on 21 December 1957 from 1245 Zulu, 1350 Zulu, 1415 Zulu, 1425 Zulu.

3. Other details: 190/75, 190°/75° at 0900, 210°/80° at 1000, 230°/80° at 1031, 235°/45° at 1045, 240°/45° at 1100, 250°/45° at 1115, 270°/30° at 1130.

4. Altitude above surface was clear, 10,000 feet and 170/100; 50,000 feet, 230/100, 10,000 feet, 230/50; 20,000 feet, 250/100, 10,000 feet, 270/100; 50,000 feet.

5. Photography was accomplished at 0900Z, with a German made Leica camera, lens F3.5, and F22, with exposure times between one and ten seconds.

6. The incident was reported by message CHED-OPS 1139, DTG 130925Z, December 1957, Detachment 15, 548th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Misawa Air Base, Japan.

7. Photography was accomplished at 0900Z, approximately 7 miles south of Chitose, Hokkaido, Japan, with a German made Leica camera, lens F3.5, and F22, with exposure times between one and ten seconds.

8. Photography was by Capt William R. Gowdy, 613th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Detachment 12 AFB 919.

QUALITY: POOR

This PI Report has been written to fulfill a request submitted by Captain George Gregory
AFOIN HFIG concerning analysis of UFO Photography.
1. After detailed review of IR 2-58 and three attached photos. It is apparent that
discrepancies exist in the data presented.
The image measurements on the respective photos were as follows:
P-21142 Length (mm) 3.10 Width (mm) .85
P-21143 1.05 .11
P-21144 1.7 .11
These image dimensions when produced by 105mm lens dictates the angle is subtended
by the traces of the objects in space. They are as follows:
P-21142 Length (mm) 3.10 10' 41" x 26'
P-21143 1.05 00' x 34' = 20'
P-21144 1.7 00' 55" = 39'

2. Using the given speed of 31Oc or 5.94 m/s min and the limits of exposure times of
1 and 4 min the images shown could only have been produced by the item traveling at
the respective distances.
P-21142 (1 min) (4 min)
201 m 805 m
P-21143 595 m 2379 m
P-21144 839 m 3355 m
Some reexamining of the image would occur at the frame and lens axis that would
at an angle other than 90°, the extent is not determinable from the data given.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which includes a table with latitude and longitude coordinates, time, position, average velocity, and other details related to various UFO sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

3. The following is a list of the latitudes and longitudes for various sightings, and the times of such. The sightings all took place in this list contain only latitudes.

Position Latitude Longitude Time Altitude Average Velocity
(Miles) (min) (MPH)

42° - 00' N 139° - 30'E 093562 - 51.1 4 766 
42° - 55' N 140° - 30'E 09002 37.0 2 510
42° - 45' N 141° - 00'E 0112 -14.2 9 94.7
42° - 55' N 140° - 30'E 0132 25.7 1 1542 
43° - 12' N 140° - 20'E 0182 21.3 6 213
43° - 20' N 140° - 23'E 9202 14.4 2 122
42° - 34' N 139° - 37'E 9222 93.9 8 629
42° - 00' N 139° - 18'E 9292 23.1 1 1686
41° - 53' N 139° - 52'E 9312 30.0 2 900

The above positions were plotted and the time between grid and geographic coordinates were noted. The relation between geographic coordinates was computed. From these values the average speeds were computed. The mean of these average speeds was 1262 mi/hr or a value not consistent with the data reported. If the computed speeds at 0.0002 or 766 mi/hr were used in place of the reported 310k to compute ranges. The ranges would be increased by a factor of more than 10. Finalizing this situation requires additional investigation.

4. The location of the observation starting and the heading and elevation angles during the sighting were not included. While data is prime importance in evaluating photos for other supporting data.

Likewise, nothing was stated concerning type of film used or development it received. The photo images did not appear as closely as would be expected to the operations methods however nothing definitive can be ascertained because of the lack of data.

Conclusions: From the above analysis it is shown that considerable contradiction in results are the direct effect of inconsistent data. Unless the points in question regarding the data can be resolved no valid conclusions can be made.

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT
TO: AFOIN-4hh
AGENT: Capt. Gregory
1. This report is not sufficiently documented for a complete evaluation to be made. Obviously, photos of an object "thought to be the same object" as visually and radar two days earlier are of no value.
2. However, based on the above, and considering the number of people who reported the sighting, plus the fact that the object was said to have been seen from several places, it would indicate just what these people did see. The erratic movements of the target on the scope and the course sound like unaccountable and inexplicable. This report appears to fall in the category of those incidents which cannot be satisfactorily explained.

1. Photographs attached to UFO report from 84th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron have been examined and the following analysis made from a photographic standpoint:
a. Object photographed was a stationary light of some type and could be an exposure of 1/10 to 1/2 second or a moon or star as it does not likely become an object or an exposure of 45 seconds, there would be subject movement resulting in a streak.
b. There is no similarity between the one print and the other 3 which are the same and it is doubtful that they are of the same object.
2. Any further photographic analysis of these photos would require negative and information on camera used, etc.

COMMENT NR 2
The film strip is a color positive and the prints are in black and white negative form.
1. As requested, prints from attached film strip have been made and are included. The film strip is a color positive and the prints are in black and white negative form.
2. From a photographic analysis of the prints, the following facts are evident:
a. Exposure was definitely a time exposure made of a moving illuminated object.
b. The difference in length of exposed streaks on prints is due to length of exposure and the speed object traveled during the exposure.
c. The difference in width of objects on prints is due to the amount of rotation on film caused by the intensity of light striking it. This, in turn, was controlled by the use of different apertures as stated in data sheet.
d. Normally with an exposure made into the sky at time these photos were made, the stars will also appear on a light sensitive film similar to the object. An overcast sky would prevent this but it would also prevent a planet from appearing.

SUBJECT: Report of Sighting and Attempted Interest of UFO
1. Approximately 0930 16 December 1957, I left the mess hall to return to my BOQ. When passing the NCO barracks Sgt. Pinkerson asked if I had seen the object. I went to the window and noticed what at first glance seemed to be a very bright light directly to the west and slightly north. It was round and appeared to be hovering. I immediately turned on the instrument beacon and notified the operations officers. We watched the object for thirty (30) seconds then called operations hill and requested that the sighting be reported. The senior director has informed me that they were painting the object on the radar. It was separately so registered.
3. I very definitely feel that the object I saw visually was not a star or planet. This being very brilliant and seemed to fluctuate small orange or red pinpoints of light from underneath.
4. Shortly after the contact lost by our radar equipment it was determined the radar did become inoperative due to a bad crystal. This could have caused the observed disappearance of the object.

STATEMENT

Statement Concerning the UFO sighted by this station (Plutchot-A)
Times: Approximately 17:45-18:59 I with personnel visual sighting at 
1800 I or 0002.
Date: 12 December 1957.
Chitose Craft reported Officer Evening shift 16:30 Lt. Wright
was called outside by one of the airmen to observe a very bright light
in the southwest. At this time the object was still visible. It appeared
to be rounded (circular) in shape, glowing reddish-orange in color, and had already moved
into a range of ninety (90) miles in this short time. I next estimated
the speed of the object to be between 600 and 650 knots. For the remainder of the time we carried the object at approximately 550 knots
while it seemed to be pulling its altitude slowly up or down.
At 17:45 I was able to get outside operations to view the object.
At first visual sighting I judged the object to be the size of this station. 
I did not get the immediate impression that the object was a star for the following reasons: (1) It seemed too close, (2) To size-specified,
(3) It looked much like a round auto headlamp in the distance, (4) 
The object seemed to have a very distinct 750 mph tendency to remain quite 
distinct to the eye. At first, with the naked eye, I estimated the object
appeared to be roughly 450 miles away. It was just above a red light on a distant mountain Southwest of this station. Immediately the object seemed to move forward to more or less the same spot. From the different 
times I assure myself of this movement. At a later time the object
seemed to move in the opposite direction (Westward) until it finally faded
from view of other observers. I think that the object's flight pattern
rather than up from below the object will verify this above.
The following:
Glowing White Body - Reddish-Orange (Flames-like) emission emitted from the rear of the object as it moved.
The white body and yellow arms (2) were reddish-orange glow from the emission of the object seemed to flash more distinct in shape and color.
The reddish-orange (flame-like) emission from the rear of the object seemed to
be U cLt^iiied

The text in the document is as follows:

STATEMENT
16 December 1957

The UFO which appeared SSW of Aomiyama on the 12th of December, 1957 appeared to be a bright, star-like object. I watched the object four times for periods of about three minutes each. The first two times I saw it, the intensity of light was very bright. The last two times I saw it, the intensity of light was not quite as bright. (The approximate coordinates were 08952, 09102, 09402, and 09502.) I viewed it with a pair of 7x50 binoculars as the naked eye.

The object's form was oval, almost circular. The intensity of light seemed the same all over the oval form but the left side glowed slightly brighter than the right side. There were two long steady arms of light extending from the left side. These were the most distinct thing about the object. At times there appeared to be a double or triple image, and the only one visible with the naked eye was the most distinct second image. This could have been caused by the intensity of light. The object's speed was very slow, approximately the same speed as a jet aircraft passing overhead. The object had no other distinct characteristics which was a white light. The object had no other distinct characteristics.

STATEMENT

16 December 1957

A2C Davidson requested that I bring the binoculars and accompany him to view the object reported by some USAF men at this site. When I first viewed the object, I was impressed by the exceptional brightness of the object and the unusual way it glowed. The object appeared to be approximately 20°9 or 23°9 in reference to Chitose. I first viewed this object at approximately 0054, 16 December 1957. As I continued the observation, the object and it continued to grow in size and brightness, was heading toward me (the observer determined by position of object in reference to the distinguishable lights on a distant mountain). As the object approached a position approximately 20 or 25 degrees above the horizon, the glow completely surrounding the object. The object never went more than approximately 25°9 or 25°9 from directly above. The object reached its maximum and size at approximately 0932. At this same time a message was relayed to me that the object did in fact diminish in size and brilliance, turn reddish and blink out. The object reappeared and its size and brightness very rapidly. The object was reported to have been varying in little more than 20 feet. I could not observe visually any change in the object's location (azimuth or altitude) except by its position relative to certain lights and landmarks observed. I watched the object until 12 December 1957. After 12 December the glow could no longer be observed. I lost complete visual contact with the object at 0952Z, 12 December 1957.
I feel quite confident that what I observed to be the only star in the sky on my way to work tonight (0732, 12 December 1957). In the same general direction from Hughes as the above mentioned object, was the object mentioned at lights were not distinguishable in the sky and there was no low cloud cover to obscure them. The object was not blinking and there was no trail or exhaust visible.

STATEMENT

16 December 1957

At approximately 1930, 12 December, my attention was called to an illuminated object, something like a landing light of an aircraft, except it seemed distant and extremely bright. The object illuminating seemed to fluctuate. I observed the phenomenon until approximately 1930 as varying in intensity to be moving West Southwest and illuminating in intensity.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

STATEMENT

16 December 1957

At approximately 1310I, 12 December 1957, MSgt. Dickerson called me by telephone informing me of the existence of "something" in the sky and requesting I attempt to get a picture of the object. I apparently sighted the object a few minutes after while standing in front of the mess hall. At my first observation I noted a light which appeared to be stationary. Shortly, the object started to move in a northerly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. The object appeared to have the same intensity as that of a burning magnesium. I felt that I could discern a slight movement of a large pendulum, however I was unable to time a definite pendulum swing. The object approached the size of a large streetlight. There appeared to be the area of the object and a luminous glow surrounding the object extending over the Sea of Japan across Tsugaru Strait. I observed the object from behind Building T-25, and in the POL area on receiver hill. During these observations I noted that the object was becoming lower on the horizon and that the intensity of the object was not so great as when I originally sighted the object. I was unable to draw any realistic conclusions from my observations as to what or where the object was.

UNCLASSIFIED

16 DECEMBER 1957

An approximately 1000 feet object in the sky southwest
of this airbase at about 1 minute duration. The object
appeared to be hovering at first, then went into a very
fast climb. We were unable to get a return on our search
equipment, but it appeared on the radarscope: a high intensity
trace of a visual case operations. However, we were unable to
determine the possibilityo of technical or air matter. The
object was continuously tracked with the APN. The object's speed
ranged from 100 to 700 knots. The object changed direction was made
every minute. The object seemed to be "pulsing" or "blinking" and
such changes in characteristics but we could never find a final
determination of the object.

It again went outward, and the object seemed dimmer. It was the most
unusual object I have ever observed. It appeared to be the size of
the B-24 aircraft, but outward from it, it was blinding looking, at
the end there were never any trails, or vapor trails on. A star
give us never seen it after. The distance of the object, I have never
seen a star of clouds at such. The location of the object.

STATEMENT
16 December 1957

On the 12th of December 1957 at approximately 1815 hours I witnessed an object in the sky. An object to which I have never seen before. The size of my knowledge can best be described as a ball, so to speak, of a luminous and also dull light of the color white.
The appearance of the object was there and there for a definite purpose and it seemed to be hovering and undulating slowly may be approximately 175 yards 12 December 1957 the object appeared to gin and I witnessed this same object from the same site and once again it made the same appearance.
My opinion of the object is definitely controlled by man due to the technical approach and disappearance.

UNCLASSIFIED
16 December 1957
The night of December 12 someone came into operations and said that there was a strange bright object in the sky. They said it looked like a bright star. When I went out to look at it, I admit it did look like a bright star. But the light on it was rather large like a landing condition was 1 of our stations. Someone must have gotten the bright idea to turn our sdf antenna in that direction because we did have indications on the scope that we were picking up the object. Distance was about forty miles and its lowest attitude was about 45 degrees. Efforts were made to make contact but we could get no definite speed. On the few times its movements were discernible, it did seem to back down and north and east. Then when I went out to look at the light, it looked dimmer. Sighters were somewhat on it. When they got close to it, they were supposed to have said it disappeared.

STATEMENT
16 December 1957
Lt. Wright, and I saw the object at about the same time, approximately 1750R, 12 December 1957. It was very easy to see without the aid of binoculars and was about three (3) times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. At first I looked at it with the naked eye and upon looking through the binoculars it appeared to be round with a very brilliant glow around it. It seemed to be closer than any star in the sky and upon placing the binoculars in a stationary position it was observed moving in a northerly direction and tracking approximately North 10° East. I observed it for about ten (10) minutes and intermittently lost sight of it due to the intermittent lighting at approximately intensity until it began to fade about the last fifteen minutes. It appeared to be round and white in color.

Text extracted from the document:

On 6 December 1957 at approximately 2015 hours, a USAF, T, OKAMOTO, Pilot of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing at Chitose AB, Hokkaido, Japan, observed an unidentified object. He first thought it to be a star, only it was several times brighter and much larger. The object appeared to be stationary and emitting a flashing light. He observed it for about 5 minutes. The movement could be detected from the light and out of the light and out of the light slight movement could be detected. At the same time the object seemed to be tumbling - the light getting brighter and dimmer. When first observed the object was about 90 degrees above the horizon. During the observation it lowered to about 45 degrees. The object finally disappeared in the direction of the horizon.

STATEMENT
16 December 1959

My first impression of the UFO was that it was from the southwest. It appeared to be in a straight line, moving West and then to the East. It was a whitish color and quite bright. When I first saw it, it appeared quite close. After 7 or 8 minutes it began to diminish for a return to turn vertical, and it had a second visual I found the object to be dimming and moving in a Westerly direction.

16 December 1957

We were working as usual on our 4:30 to 12:30 shift on the night of December 16, 1957. While working on the control panel of the sudden flare was an increased amount of motion. I was pulling at the time and didn't know what was going on. The overhead seemed to be flaring up outside. If this was someone to relieve me as do I could find out what was going on. 
On going outside I discovered lights in the sky. They appeared to be moving at a tremendous speed. They were very bright and slightly smaller than commercial aircraft. At one time I looked at it through 7x50 binoculars and it appeared the size of a dime at arm's length. It varied altitudes at almost every move. At one time it appeared to be below 1000 feet and at other times higher than 7000 feet. It appeared to be at those altitudes at seconds and fractions of a second it seemed. From the way it appeared on the scope it couldn't be a reflection off of some clouds because there were no clouds in the sky.

REMARKS:
RCAF (RCAF) F-45 assumed control of Subway Red at 09222 and immediately vectored it toward the object. F-45 was painting the object by the height-range finder and visually. Red reportedly maneuvered the object. At 09552 the report reported a visual on a bright object off the coast which, but visual tracking was lost. Since the object and Subway Red was told to cancel the mission, it can be ascertained the object went away between 2400, 110 miles from the site. Subway Red was vectored until approximately 2350' and obtained another visual. However, the visual was broken off and it was reported they were observing a reciprocal.

MEMO ROUTING SLIP

REMARKS: Fn. Cru. Capt. Comment: CApT Toshimoto Nato of 10th Guard plane was flying his plane when he noted Venus hovering almost stationary in the sky. It continued to show color variations from red to blue and was revolving at intervals of 5-10 minutes. This is the first time I have ever seen an identification of VENUS as the object of observer. In analyzing the details it appears quite probable that the unusual display of this planet was seen. The observer is a capable officer in the Ground Controlled Intercept outfit and there seems no reason to doubt his statements.

Transcription of the text:

There appeared 5 m in diameter at the horizon and the objects appeared to be heading northwest and were travelling at a high rate of speed.
Estimated to be at least 1000 miles per hour.

In fact the object did not ascent or descend so the shape and the size remain the same.
Astronomers are now trying to determine if VENUS visible during to the period.
No actual details of objects were discernible due to haze and cannot determine the exact nature of the objects.
