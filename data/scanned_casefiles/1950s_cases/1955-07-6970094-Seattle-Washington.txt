10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Three (3) white objects, still in sight at the
time of the preliminary report, appeared the
size of a star. The objects were seen for a
period of thirty minutes at the time of the
report. The observer had four witnesses.

11. COMMENTS
The fact that the observer had four
witnesses would tend to eliminate the
possibility of optical phenomena. The
description of the sighting could pos-
sibly be that of a balloon cluster
reflecting the lights of the city.
Sendpoint NAS releases many balloons,
with winds permitting, drift over
Seattle.
