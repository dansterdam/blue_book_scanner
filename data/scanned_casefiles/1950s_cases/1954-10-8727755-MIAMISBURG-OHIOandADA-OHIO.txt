The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line on the horizon, and the instructions indicate that this represents how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it.

The second sketch depicts a larger view, showing the position of the object when the observer first saw it, and a reference to a smaller sketch to provide an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The third sketch shows a landscape with mountains in the distance and a person standing in the foreground, suggesting a perspective of the observer's view.

All the text found in the document is:

12. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
