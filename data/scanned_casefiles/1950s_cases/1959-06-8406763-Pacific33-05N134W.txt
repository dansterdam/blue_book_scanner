There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old document containing text.

The text from the document is as follows:

"The number of meteors reported as flying saucers or spaceships has diminished in the last few years, but the Air Force has continued to investigate all doubtful or puzzling sightings to determine whether they constitute a security hazard. Every such identification of a UFO as merely a meteor, planet, or satellite is bringing certain amount of relief.

The typical case, successfully solved, is that of June 26, 1959. About 9:15 p.m. PST the pilot of a United Airlines flight over the Pacific Coast a little east of the Oregon-California border had observed an apparent rocket firing about thirty-five miles west of the plane. The pilot described the passage of a small, brilliant light which flashed a bright flash of light, then the entire sky lighted up and he saw four round, fiery globules of an intense reddish-orange color, with no trails. Flying two by two, they were observed for three or four minutes.

The weather was clear and calm, the visibility excellent. The pilot noted another plane some 100 miles to the west reported seeing the same objects at the same time (1:51).

Because this sighting occurred in a very sensitive area where military officials were expecting a Russian test firing of an ICBM, the Air Force made an extensive study of this report. However, the United Airlines pilot estimated the distance of the objects as only about 10 miles, and their rate of travel as seemingly comparable to that of a jet fighter, but indicated that their trajectory, and the fact that they climbed and disappeared vertically, and the rapid "power plant" was apparently still operating at this stage of flight, indicated the impossibility of a meteoric or ballistic trajectory. However, the Air Force concluded that the object sighted was in all probability a meteor."
