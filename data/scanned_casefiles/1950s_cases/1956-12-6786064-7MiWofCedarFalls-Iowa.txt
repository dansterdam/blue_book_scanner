SUBJECT: Unidentified Balloon

TO:    Commander

        Wright Patterson Air Force Base
        Dayton, Ohio

1. Subject balloon was found by Mr. [redacted] in a roadside ditch adjacent to his mother's home located 7 miles west of Cedar Falls, Iowa. Mr. [redacted] found the balloon 12 December 1956. He stated that the balloon was not in the ditch previous to that date.

2. The balloon envelope indicated that the balloon may have been of cellular construction. The remains of the envelope were in shreds which were 14 - 15 feet in length. The shreds were examined minutely and no identifying marks could be found. The shreds were cut off the base assembly.

3. Futile attempts were made to identify the remains of the balloon by the Operations and/or Intelligence section of:

    a. 20th Air Division
    b. Central Air Defense Force
    c. Western Air Defense Force
    d. Air Defense Command

4. Mr. [redacted] stated that he had found a balloon similar to this one in 1948 but that it was not as large as this one, and it bore General Mills markings. He further stated that he had disassembled the metal portion in hopes of finding indications of a reward such as he had received in the case of the 1948 finding. He said that he had searched the adjacent areas thoroughly for additional parts of the balloon but found none. Search of the area subsequent to the finding was preceded by a snowfall which blanketed the entire area.

5. The finding was at first suspected to be one of the balloons launched from the Vandalia, California Site; however, WADF Investigation eliminated the possibility. There being no satisfactory

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD                                   3 January 1957

SUBJECT: (U) Balloon Identification - Recommendations

1. Subject item was forwarded to ATIC after all efforts were made by pertinent agencies to identify it as to origin, purpose and design. It appears that it is not of U. S. origin. As such, it possesses a potential for intelligence information.

2. Inasmuch as it has been identified as a known object, it falls out of the UFO category and should be placed in the hands of pertinent specialists for further intelligence exploitation, if any.

3. Accordingly, to assist you in this matter the following are offered:

    a. Have made arrangements with Mr. Arnold, 442 Equipment Specialist, to work with you in this respect.

    b. Mr. [redacted] and this officer, previously worked on a balloon equipment project and you will find him very cooperative.

    c. Some of the intelligence requirements for information that may be considered in this matter would include origin, purpose, track of the balloon, possibly jet streams, or upper atmospheric data that may relate to the object, etc.

[Signed]

1. Receipt of subject balloon is herewith acknowledged.

2. An examination of the components and the type of plastic material indicates that the balloon is not of foreign origin, and unquestionably a constant-altitude type manufactured by General Mills, Inc., and released by one of the Air Force research contractors. General locale of launching is believed to have been from either the Sioux City or Minneapolis area.

3. Any action deemed necessary may be taken by your organization in notifying the agencies previously contacted (reference paragraph 3 of same commission) regarding this matter.
