Dear sir:
This, I suppose, should have been reported long ago; but a difficult matter to decide what to do under the circumstances may give my husband, Cla'd. Schmidt, and me hesitant to call Earle and I were planning from a picnic, about 8:50 P.M. when the saw this entry while driving quite low, and very possibly 100 mph, for 15 minutes, as though it were attempting to do something. Then all at once it went up into the air and were out of sight in less than a minute.
We were quite averase from it and only about 3 miles: about 24 miled south of Ely, Nevada.
