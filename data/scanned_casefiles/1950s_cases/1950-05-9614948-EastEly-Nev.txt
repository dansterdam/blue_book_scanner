Dear Sir:

This, I suppose should have been reported long ago, but I didn't know who is to report anything about flying saucers, until just the other day!

Our May 7th my husband, Ed.W. Schmidt, my grandson Lowell Earl and I were returning from a picnic, about 4:46-6:30 PM when we saw this silvery white object hovering quite low, 100 ft. from the ground. It moved back and forth for 10 minutes as though it was trying to gain altitude. Then all 7 or 8 then it went up into the air and was out of sight in less than a minute.

We were directly across from it and only about 2 1/2 or 3 miles away. It was about 9 miles south of Ely, Nevada.

Yours truly-

[Signature area is blacked out]
