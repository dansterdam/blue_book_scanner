THE SIGHTING OF A FLYING SAUCER-TYPE OBJECT

Place Observed: Centerville, Queen Anne's County, Md.

Date and Time: March 20, 1952 - 10:42 p.m.

Length of Time Object was Sighted: Approximately 30 seconds

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
An orange-yellow saucer shaped light, two or three times the size of the average wing light on an airplane. It was travelling about halfway between the horizon and zenith from the compass to seaward at a very fast rate of speed, and continued at an extremely fast speed and continued on at the higher level. Its upward dip did not appear to be very high. The object appeared to be more enough to hear some noise from it, if there was any, but no noise was heard.

Report of Sighting

Mr. [redacted] of [redacted], Washington, D. C.

The sighting took place at Centerville, Queen Anne's County, Md., on 20 March 1952 at 2:42.

The object was described as a dull, orange-yellow, saucer-shaped light resembling an old-fashioned light bulb. The size of the light was twice to three times that of an ordinary a/c wing light.

The object was traveling very fast and seemed about five miles away from the observer halfway between the horizon and zenith.

The only maneuver performed by the object was twice jumping vertically a distance equal to what looked like a foot at that range. The jumping is similar in nature to the bounce of a basketball.
