DATE: July 34 1952

It was about 10 AM Thursday morning that
I went into the back yard to converse with
my neighbor. As I was talking to her, I
read a plane and I always look upward.
I heard one, and as I did, I noticed
this shining object. I at once tried to
my neighbor "look up and see the
flying object". She looked up and said
perhaps other neighbors. We watched it for
about twenty minutes and during that time
I went and called the Miami Herald.

6 Newspaper, to report it. The object as it moved across the sky seemed to give off things greater evidence in a while. & then will be a "ruffle" moving around it. It was a white or silvery object and so it was very high, so no it didn't look very large. However, it was very high on comparison to an airplane flying by, at a fairly high altitude. It seemed to move real fast and when we first sighted it, it seemed to move into the same on its ways.
