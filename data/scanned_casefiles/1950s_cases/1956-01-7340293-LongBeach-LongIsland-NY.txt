II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a mature, level-headed, well to do businessman and displayed concern over his sighting which he had felt was his duty to report, but was worried about receiving any publicity over the matter. At no time did SOURCE indicate that he had seen a saucer or other interplanetary vehicle, but conversely expressed his confusion over the strange series of events that had taken place before his eyes. At no time did the SOURCE tend to embellish any of the details involved nor were there any contradictions in his statements.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was driving home at 18/2140J (About 6:00 PM in a westerly direction). About four miles from home he noticed what he at first believed to be a crescent-shaped silver of the moon and continued on his way. Looking up moments later he again saw the object, however it had changed its position from vertical to horizontal. Once more this was ignored since he felt that some upper layer of clouds had passed in front of the moon giving it haze and strange form. Then in a few seconds it reappeared in an entirely different position he became concerned and stopped the car. After watching it slowly drift downward from one position to another for a couple of moments, he got into his car again and hurried home. He rushed to the upstairs bedroom of his house, located on the beach overlooking New York Harbor, and with the aid of binoculars, observed the object for about 25 minutes longer. SOURCE was certain that he had seen the object for about 25 miles and that it was about 30 miles at a heading of about 275 degrees. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon at first and then drifted slowly, downward to about 20 degrees until darkness prevented further observation. The sizes were said to have given the impression of being well defined, but that the distance involved prevented the detection of any details. I, gave SOURCE the impression of the silver lining of a cloud but that it did not shimmer. It was white and brighter than the background sky and since it was a clear day with excellent visibility, it remained slight at all times till darkness.

SOURCE wore glasses and made his observation with 10x50 binoculars through the bedroom window. SOURCE added that all movement was gradual, that it appeared to be a solid object, remained constant in shape, and left no trail. He did not notice any celestial bodies at the time of his sighting. SOURCE stated that it appeared to be about three to five times as large as a commercial transport aircraft at the same distance and was about the size of a pea held at arm's length.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check was made with the Filter Center at White Plains, New York which has several GOC posts in the same area in which SOURCE lives. Negative results.

2. A check was made with the Base Operations section of Mitchell AFB, New York, and the records of the AO reviewed. Negative results.

3. A check with the AO Stewart AFB Weather Office revealed that on the afternoon of 18 Jan 56, the sky condition was clear and the wind were as follows:

Level                   Direction                Velocity
Surface                 360°                     15 to 20 knots
1,000 to 8,000 feet     360°                     30 knots
10,000 feet             340°                     35 knots
15,000 feet             330°                     50 knots
20,000 feet             350°                     65 knots
30,000 feet             300°                     75 knots

Considering the wind factors above, the only stations in the area surrounding the location of the sighting which are responsible for the release of RAOB's are at Albany, New York, Buffalo, New York and Mitchell AFB, New York. These balloons are released daily at 0900Z and 2100Z.

4. Contact with the Coast Guard Station located at Short Beach, Long Island, New York, and the Floyd Bennett Airport, Long Island, New York, revealed that no remarkable any report of a sighting.

5. A check with Newsday, the Garden City Long Island newspaper, revealed that a woman had called and reported an object in about the same position and at about the same time, however no name or address was given. She stated that it appeared to be motionless and that it hovered something like a balloon.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the sighting might have been caused by a weather balloon released at Buffalo, New York at 0900Z since the report-ed velocities were insufficient to transport the object the required distance in the 40 minutes elapsed from the time of the sighting at 2140Z and the time of the evening release at 2100Z.

2. The north and north-westerly winds tend to rule out the probability of a balloon originating at Mitchell AFB, which lies about 25 miles northeast of the location of the sighting.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. The following additional information was revealed by the Investigating Officer upon request of this headquarters:

    a. Piball balloons are released at 0300Z, 0900Z, 1500Z, and 2100Z daily from both civil and military agencies in the New York City area, LaGuardia and Idlewild Airports release this type balloon at the above times.

    b. These balloons are three feet in diameter with balloon color dependent upon sky conditions at the time of release. On a clear day, as was 18 Jan 56 in the New York City area, white piball balloons were released.

    2. It is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was caused by a piball type balloon released at LaGuardia Airport (code# GJEL120L) at 18/2100Z January 1956. The following items are given in support of the above hypothesis:

    a. LaGuardia Airport is located fifteen (15) miles north-northwest of the SOURCE'S home. Winds at the time of the sighting were from the north and northwest, thereby carrying the balloon released at LaGuardia Airport at 18/2100Z Jan 56 to a position west of the observer.

    b. At 2140Z, the time of the sighting and forty (40) minutes after the release of the piball from LaGuardia, it has been computed that the subject balloon would have been approximately eight (8) miles west of the observer and at an altitude of 22,000 feet.

    c. From the above figures we can obtain the angle of elevation of the balloon as seen from the SOURCE'S location as follows:
