Here is the text from the document:

realize how frequently mirages occur. Many persons do not know what a mirage is or what can cause it. First, let me say that a mirage is something real, not a hallucination like a pink elephant. Nor is it an optical illusion. Light may depart appreciably from its nearly straight-line path when exceptional temperature conditions occur in the lower atmosphere, as, for example, when an intensely

hot or extremely cold layer of air lies close to the earth's surface. The air acts as a sort of lens to bring a distant light source into focus. The lens is imperfect, so that the world seen through it is distorted and unfamiliar; it is a little like looking through someone else's spectacles. No wonder one sees weird things – even flying saucers. This brief description of a mirage will have to serve until we again consider the question in more detail, in a later chapter.
