HORRY COUNTY MAN SHOOTS FLYING SAUCER
Dick Watches After Receiving
Direct Hit

All over the United States reports have been made of the sighting of various unusal objects in the sky, now commonly referred to as "Flying Saucers," and just such a thing was reliably reported by _____ of the Popular and Aerial community of Horry County, this week.

Booth is a 29 year old ex-serviceman, a member of the Popular Methodist Church and of exceedingly high character throughout the area in which he is known. There is no doubt in the minds of those who know him well, including neighbors, that no nature trifling and of high moral integrity. What he saw was no hoax, and he had ample data to back his story.

Booth runs a community store and service station on Highway 701 about eight miles north of Conway. He usually keeps his business open until about 11:00, which he did on the night of January 22, last Thursday.

He lives with his parents a mile or so from the store and after closing the station, he drove home and arrived there at about 11:15. His mother had left his supper prepared for him, so around 11:30 he sat down to read the paper while it was heating.

A few minutes later, he heard one of his father's mules neighing at the barn. A few minutes more and he heard his father causing a commotion, a mile back in the road easily disturbed. Then at about the same moment, the chickens and a pen of ducks began hollering and Booth sensing something was wrong, grabbed a 22 calibre pistol and went to investigate.

He was particularly anxious to investigate because the day before a cow of his had suddenly, and the veterinarian diagnosed her case of death as poisoning. Fearing some similar trouble, he went out to the barn and began to determine what type poisoning.

When this, Booth thought, perhaps some more stock was being tampered with by some one. This was outside his barn; he was directly to the barn, and seeing nothing, he went around behind the building. By this time it was near midnight and a full moon lit up the sky. The eclipse of the moon on the same night had already completely vanished. From this vantage point there, he looked up above the top of the pine trees, and there in the center above the trees, he saw a thing that he never saw before.

The object was almost still, like it was drifting at a pace slower than the Fast walk of a human. It was only some ten or twelve feet above the ground and easily visible. It was making a very low humming noise, barely detectable. Booth realizing he was looking north, looked a long distance up the history of the long discussed "flying saucers" yelled back to his wife, "Myrtle, come quick, Dick has gone crazy, about 200 yards away, and he was not able to across them.

"Well, I still wanted to know more about this thing that was hovering around over our farm. I walked up with my flashlight and directly in the beam of the light, it was easily catching up with me. I walked around it, viewed it from all sides. It was

about 24 feet long and about 12 feet across, was a light grayish color and was lit up
on the inside. The witness, a farm assembler named Booth, had been plowing and
over. I could see the light inside but could see no object in there. The back also
was something resembling a cockpit with a claimed glass over it. "I could see
through this window, but I could not see through it," Booth said.

"The object was about 6 feet or ten feet above. The front sloped upward at the
base at an angle of about 60 degrees and the back was sloped toward at an angle of
40 to 50 degrees. The sides came up almost vertically and were about 5 or 6 feet
feet and then sloped outward and joined the base at about a 45 degree angle," Booth
said. The object obviously was well in considerable and very generally, showing
lined effect something like hair or eye cut and so on.

"Underneath the 'saucer' was something resembling a built-in wheel, with half
the 'wheel,' possible three feet across, extending below the base in a crescent shape.
There were no markings anywhere on it because I looked hard for some identification,"
Booth said.

He continued, "There was no visible means of propulsion. It had
no propeller, there were no exhaust fumes showing, no vapor trail and I could detect
no rocket, trail and I could detect no sound. The object or glow alone, as I observed
alone as I ran around and around it nothing just as good a look as I could. I
walked it for about 20 minutes, maybe as much as 35 minutes."

Despite Booth's yelling for someone to come and see the object, according to
the report, no one came. He described his initial sighting at the "saucer" at a distance
about 75 feet. It hovered stationary in the sky. It was a metallic sound and
moved off. A few instant after the object left, the object began making considerable noise like a loud hum. About 300 feet of a high ridge of ground rose at
about a 65 degree angle. It kept the same course until it was completely out of
sight, Booth said.

He pointed out that the noise it made when it took off could have been heard
easily at his house. If some one had been listening for it, although it was by no
means a loud noise like an airplane or conventional design would have made.

He also debunked any notion that it was a helicopter or any other man type aircraft. "I have been in helicopters and been in and around almost every type of plane.
This was none of them and didn't resemble any of them," he said.

Booth said that he was reluctant to tell anyone about the object, even with his family. Because of the widespread debunking of those who have reported seeing objects, he was reluctant. However, his family had heard the shot, and he told them about what he had
seen.

He also told Rev. Elwell Jones, Baptist minister in Horry County, and Rev. Jones
said "I have known Lloyd Booth all my life. We are about the same age and have
been neighbors. When he says he saw something, he didn't just imagine it." Another
library citizens who have known Booth for years. "He is a Christian and we accept
this," the report stated.

And as a finishing touch, the report pointedly added: At least three other citizens
have also mysteriously in Horry County within the last three weeks. All have had

instantaneously, some never even tickled. All have died from poisoning, or a caustic nature. There have been no early symptoms. The cows simply have fallen over, and have died in an instance.

Two cows owned by Harry Anderson died of poisoning less than a mile from the sighted object on the very night that both saw it. Not some cows were killed and fed the same hay from the same field as killing time the next morning. Other cows have died the same way from Myrtle Beach Naval Air Station and Poplar Sections.

And the greatest number of hogs here died in the area in this story. Some farmers have lost whole herds. One man alone posted losses 75. They all died of cholera.

All of which adds to the mystery. What did Booth see? Why was it there. Did it have anything to do with the death of Harry Livesay?

"Flying Don't Go That Path"
BOOTH DENIES C. A. A. STORY HE HIT HELP

The Horry County farmer who on January 29 became the only man in the world to shoot a flying saucer today countered a CIA assertion that he might not actually have "wounded" a Navy blimp.

Lloyd C. Booth, 22, said: "I have seen many blimps and I've even been in one. I'd certainly know a blimp when I saw one 50 feet over my head."

That was the height of the unidentified object which floated slowly over Booth's farm on the morning of January 29 with a 22-caliber pistol. Booth sighted the object after a commotion among his livestock sent him in search of a possible trouble.

The ship suggestion came Tuesday from C. W. Hall of the CIA control tower at Bluethenthal Field, Wilmington, N. C. Hall said three Navy blimps were en route from Cherry Point, N. C., on January 29, and that one of these could have passed over Horry County at midnight when Booth was patrolling his farm.

High hundreds kept the blimps low, Hall said, which was why Booth spotted one just that afternoon when the blimps were on his land.

Booth rejected the blimp possibility on the basis of his past experience with the craft. He added:

"It was with an anti-aircraft unit for 22 months during the war and I was trained to identify planes on sight. If the object I saw and shot was a plane or a blimp, I surely would have known."

Booth described the craft as being circular, with the contour of an arc sliced from both sides. From both sides, he was unable to see what might have been a cabin on the forward topside. He saw it in light glimpses.

THE FIELD (Conway, S. C., 19 February 1953)

"BLIMPS GOING TOO FAST"

While cruising from east to west over him, the craft gave off a low hum, like a distant auto. Booth was able to keep pace with the vessel at an average walking speed. It was almost directly above him when he threw a 16 mm Bolex movie camera to his brother with a metallic sound. The craft shot up and away instantly and was beyond range then.

"I never heard of a blimp going that fast," Booth said today.

Cla-man Hall joined that an investigation of the blimps now at Mecklsville would reveal a good bit in both types of camera work. The diary has not announced any such data or indication of his association with the shooting since the event was recorded.

Reports of flying saucers have been frequent in this area during the past few weeks. One was seen near Myrtle Beach a week before the Booth shooting. A Marine Corps jet pilot pursued and lost a strange craft along the Carolina coast. Last Friday, another was seen by four people at Myrtle Beach, heard by six others a few minutes later over Marion, S. C.

Latest reports were made last night when three Myrtle Beach residents saw an unidentifiable object fly inland at approximately 1000-1030 altitude.

THE HORRY COUNTY NEWS AND THE DORIS SENTINEL, Loris, South Carolina, Thursday, February 19, 1953

BOOTH SAYS FLYING SAUCER WAS NOT A NAVY BLIMP

Conway, S. C. - Feb. 17 - The Horry County farmer who on January 22 became the only man in the world to shoot a flying saucer today denounced a CAA suggestion that he might actually have "wound" a Navy blimp.

Lloyd C. Booth, 29, said, "I have seen many blimps and I've even been in one. I'd certainly know a blimp when I saw one to float over my head."

That was the hell of the unidentified object which floated slowly over Booth's farm on the eventful night and which soared away after he shot at it with a .22 rifle. Booth said he chased the object after a cornstarch angle his 11-year-old son Lin in search of a possible prowler.

The blimp suggestion came yesterday from C. W. Hall of the CAA control tower at Blantchford Field, Wilmington, N. C. Hall said blimps "very close" from Glynco, Ga., to Mecklville, N. C. on January 22 and that one of them could easily have passed over Horry County at about the same time.

High headwinds kept the blimps low, Hall said, which was why Booth spotted one just ten feet above the line on his land.

Booth rejected the blimp possibility on the basis of his past experience with the craft. He added:

"I was with an anti-aircraft unit for 22 months during the war and I know."

"To identify plane on sight. If the object I saw and shot was a plane or a blip, I surely would have known. I watched the blip for almost 30 minutes."

Booth described the craft as being circular, with the contour of an egg sliced from end to end. He viewed it from directly below and from both sides, but was unable to describe any identifying marks or any propulsion. He saw his hitting emanating from what might have been a cabin on the forward topside and near the center.

While cruising from east to west over him, the craft gave off a low hum, like a distant auto. Booth was able to keep pace with the vessel at an average walking speed. It was almost directly above him when the craft, at his belief, struck with a metallic sound. The craft shot up and away instantly and was beyond range when Booth first heard it.

"It took off at a speed I'd estimate at 700 miles an hour," Booth said today. "I never heard of a blip going that fast."

CAA-man Hill opined that an investigation of the blips not at Mecklsville would reveal a dent in the bottom of one of the Navy's Piper Pach deck. The Navy has not announced any such damage or indicated any association with the shooting since the crash reported.

Reports of flying saucers have been frequent in this area during the past few weeks. One was seen near North Beach a week before the Poch shooting. A Marine Corps jet pilot pursued and lost a strange craft along the Carolinas coast. Last Friday, another was seen by four people at Myrtle Beach, nearby Marion. Then seen by six others a few minutes later over Marion, S. C.

Latest reports were made last night when three Myrtle Beach residents saw an unidentified object fly inland at approximately 1000-1500 altitude.

51 Man Tells of Studying Hovering 'Flying Saucer,' Shooting Into It

SC Man Tells
Some Identifications.
The man who made the report is
simply set down and drifted along
with a few humming sounds in
the sky. He said the object was
just as good a look at it could
be. He said he watched it for
about 15 minutes.

Booth said his yelling aroused no
one. So necessary was the silence
that he could hear a dog bark at
a distance of about 15
miles.

Booth said that the noise it made
was a low hum, and that it hovered
easily at his house at some
points and listened for it. He said
it was not loud like an airplane
or automobile.

When questioned about his location, Booth said he lives near the
center of Conway township, some
three miles from the river bottom
from the bottom.

Booth was very close to the
object and said he could see it
chance to settle down in a nearby clearing, so he could investigate.

continued from page 1

Identifications.
There were no visible means of
propulsion that he could see. At
times there were no exhaust
fumes. He said the object simply set there and drifted along
with a few humming sounds in
the sky.

Booth said, "I have been in helicopters and been in aircraft of
many types, but this was neither
then and didn't even faintly resemble any of them."

Booth said he watched it first to tell no one about the object,
even his family because "he was
afraid they would think he was
crazy." However, his family heard his statement and he has been
discussing it with friends, including a Baptist minister, The Rev. Mr. Jones
and others.

Booth said, "We are about the same as any other people. When he says
something happened, I say it happened."

Other Booth citations of the report say he saw the object in the
same area where he lives.

Meanwhile, other "saucer" reports
are from the same general area
in the Broadway area.

Booth, in response to a query
rapidly to a question, he said that he did not have on this report anything to add to what he had previously told.

Booth said he had closed his store
about 11 p.m. and driven about a
mile from his home. Where he lives. Booth said the object was
making a low humming noise
and was hovering over a field
near his home.

Booth said cattle near the object
did not seem to be disturbed.

Booth went on to say, "a machine about 30 feet long and 15 feet high. An eclipse
of the moon was on that night. At one point, he looked up above the top
of the trees and saw the
object."

Citizens in the area noted that at
least 12 cows about 100 yards from
the object were grazing quietly
within the last three weeks.

Booth said he doesn't know what
the object was, but he was sure
some intelligent power was behind
the result. Booth said cattle pointing in "pretty wide" areas were
from poisoning of a caustic nature.

There have been no early symptoms over and have died in 12 instances.
Two cows owned by Booth, less than
a mile from the pasture where the
object was seen, have died.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. The object sighted by [redacted] of Conway, S. C., on the night of 20 January 1953 had the following identifying characteristics:

    a. Shape - The bottom of the object was oblong-shaped. The top was of a shape much like an eye cut in half. The front blended in with the bottom and had a cell-like affair extending about four (4) feet around the sides. The back was in a pitch black color (2) round opening. The whole was covered by red lights (apparently exterior lights) more-or-less 15 or 17 inches in diameter. On the bottom of the craft was a cone-shaped object which was about 12 to 14 inches long and which covered about half of the overall length of craft.

    b. Size - The object appeared to be approximately 21 to 25 feet long and about 8 feet wide. Visually, the projection on the bottom which was about 3 or 4 feet tall and approximately the same in width.

    c. Color - The object was observed to be a dull light gray color, not like aluminum or light gray. This is hard to define. This was all observed. A dull moon.

    d. Number - There was only one (1) craft observed by Mr. [redacted]

    e. Trail or Exhaust - No trail or exhaust was observed.

    f. Propulsion System - No visible means of propulsion was observed. There were no jet, open flame, or rocket type exhausts. The observer stated that this object had a dull humming or whistling sound to it like a lawn electric door running.

    g. Speed - When first observed, the object was practically standing still. It was so slow that the observer stated it was moving at a snail's pace. For about twenty (20) minutes. It was about twenty (20) minutes after first observing the object that it began to move. It was moving about 200 feet above the ground. He heard the first shot hit the object and bounce off. It was then the object tilted slightly and went up to about a 500 foot estimated to be between 600 and 700 M.P.H. No erratic movements were noted. The object was traveling practically due west.

    h. There were no identifying marks such as numbers, insignia, and the like. No human elements were observed in the object although the cockpit-like area was fully lighted.

2. The object was observed at 37°05'N (January) for a period of twenty (20) minutes. The object was approximately 50 feet above the ground at 1/2 miles S.E. of Conway.

3. The manner of observation was visible and was observed by Mr. Booth alone.

4. The location of the observer during sighting was approximately 200 yards from his home which is located 1/2 mile to 1 mile off U.S. Highway 701, 7 miles northwest of Conway, S. C. There are no known limitations in the vicinity. The object was observed from the ground and headed the West.

6. The weather on the night of 29 January 1953 in the Horry County area was clear and cool with winds about four (4) M.P.H. This is the official report given to me by the 3d Weather Squadron at Pope A.F. Base. The CIA Correspondents flying from there were given by the CIA Control Tower. The report from there stated that high handwinds kept the blimps flying from Georgia to North Carolina unusually low.

7. There was apparently no activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

8. There was no existence of any physical evidence such as fragments, photographs and the like of sighting.

9. There was no interception or identification action taken.

10. Other than the possibility that one of the Navy blimps mentioned above might have been in the area, there was no known air traffic around at the time.

11. Reports of sighting unidentified aircraft or unconventional design have been received in the Horry County area for quite some time, but this investigation is only one that has reported seeing the objects so close at hand. Inclosed with this report are several newspaper articles on the sighting, and an other newspaper clipping. One interesting sidelight gathered from this investigation is the possibility of this area are quite unique objects are repeatedly sighted. They claim that every time one of these objects is reportedly sighted, within twenty-four hours several cows in the vicinity are found dead. They may that the cattle have died from caustic or lead poisoning. This may or may have been reported sighting.

To Whom It May Concern:

I have talked to [redacted] on five occasions since he sighted a mysterious flying object on the night of January 22, 1953. Mr. [redacted] has told me the same story on each occasion. He told it in deadly seriousness. He was never tangled up on details and never had to check a single question concerning his story that I would ask him.

He is quiet, introvert type personality. He is not prone to talk much. He told me one could interview for several days without learning much more than he already knew.

I talked with a large number of Mr. [redacted] neighbors, including some who have known him all his life. Everywhere his character stands out. He is a road, Charleston, Charleston area that has never been known to lie or misrepresent anything. Rev. [redacted], a Baptist preacher in Horry county who has known him, said all his life he was of good character and when he told you something you could depend upon it. The same story is told by every individual in that community that we have contacted.
