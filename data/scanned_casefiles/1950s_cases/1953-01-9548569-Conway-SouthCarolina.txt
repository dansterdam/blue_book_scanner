THE FIELD, CONWAY, S. C., THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1953
FORTY EIGHT MAN SHOOTS FLYING SAUCER
Details Varlous After Receiving DIREC TIVE

ALL over the United States reports have come in in the last week of various unidentified flying objects seen in the skies, With many reports coming from South Carolina, Conway, this week. 

According to a 26 year old ex-serviceman, a member of the Peoples Methodist Church and active in the affair of local government, he reports that on February 7, about 8:30 p.m. he, his mother and his brother were standing on his father's farmland near Conway observing a lighted, saucer-shaped object in the sky. 

Details of the object are as follows: It was about the size of a good sized apple held at arms length, round, silver and saucer shaped. It appeared to be about 200 yards away at an altitude of about 1,500 feet. It remained stationary for a few moments, then took off at a terrific speed, faster than any jet plane. There was no sound to the object. 

When the object took off, the witness became greatly excited and yelled to his mother, "Look, there it goes!" His mother and brother both saw the object. The witness then ran to the house, got his 30-30 rifle, ran back to the spot where it had been seen and fired 48 shots at it, emptying his rifle. The object had disappeared from sight by that time. He fired the shots mostly to see if he could hit it, to determine what it was.

He reports that since that time, his father has talked to him and told him that it would be best to keep quiet about the incident as it may get him into trouble. He has been afraid to say anything to the public or the authorities about it until now. He felt it his duty to report what he had seen and done. 

This appears to be one of the many incidents of unidentified flying objects seen in various parts of the country recently. The Air Force is investigating all reports received.

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PLACE OF ORIGIN: (Conway, S. C. - February 9, 1953)
SUBJECT: SAUCER (The saucer, Conway S.C. February 9, 1953)
SUMMARY: On February 9, 1953 between 12:30 and 12:50 pm, a 15-20 feet diameter disc-like object was observed on the trail near Conway, South Carolina. It was dull gray in color and was moving erratically, slowly gaining altitude. It was observed by two adults for several minutes, but it could not be approached. Both said, "The object obviously was never in contact with the ground and was completely under control in its motion."
"Under the weather," the observers claimed, accounting for a hill-in where it momentarily disappeared from view. The object was seen to emerge over the hill and continue on its way without interruption. The object was not audible and did not leave a trail.
To summarize, "There was no visible sign of propulsion. No vapor trail. No noise. No disturbance of the surrounding air. It simply moved as if under complete control and with apparent anti-gravity characteristics."
Destruction Regime: To be destroyed by consigning to the wastepaper basket & by forgetting the matter.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FLYING SAUCET (The Field, Conway, S. C., 5 February 1953)
Investigator advised that two men, Henry Anderson and William Dillon, citizens of Cad.ton, North Carolina,
have definitely sighted unusual lights which they believe were flying saucers on the night of 5 February 1953.
Two cases owned by Henry Anderson died of poisoning less than a mile from the direction from which the lights came.
The dogs were outside at the time, and the animates died shortly after the lights were sighted and moved on. Other
dogs near by were not affected. 
And the intricate nature of how they have diet in the same direction. Some precaution
should be taken to try to determine the cause of this strange happening.

THE FIELD, Conway, S. C., Thursday, February 19, 1953
"BOTH DOGS C.A.A. TAKE HIS LIFE"

That C. A. had just returned from seeing and talking with some of the only witnesses in the world to
what a strange and unexplained thing, for this man apparently committed suicide on January 29, because he was
distraught over some of the things he had seen and could not understand. 
As ye this is only a report, we are still investigating.
I fly may 6, 1953, death, 29th, after "I have not seen anything to warrant his death, and I'm very much in the dark
as to the whole matter.' This was the remark of a prominent physician in the area, whose statement gives us a
clue that there was perhaps a possible premature to the death of C. A.
The details are still sketchy, but it is known that C. A. was employed as an air traffic controller a Myrtle Beach
airport, and that some unusual activities and objects had been observed in the sky which he had cause to report
to his superiors. This, coupled wit h the strange deaths of the two dogs, seem to indicate that C. A. may have
known something about these unidentified objects that led to his death under somewhat unexplained circumstances.
Both incidents have been carefully investigated, and it is believed that the 11.5. possibility on the scale of his
past experience with the war and I was trained this way indicate a possible clue to the real reason behind his
death.
Further investigation is continuing in an effort to determine if there is any connection between the strange dog
deaths and the death of C. A. This report is classified as UNCLASSIFIED.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

THIS FIELD (CONWAY, S. C., 19 FEBRUARY 1953)
"BAREPS DAVIS CO THAT PAST"

A civilian called and reported the following: "The witness, who was driving alone, suddenly observed a bright lihgt in the clear sky which seemed to be approaching him at a high rate of speed. He said that the light appeared to be very close at hand, and was shaped like an inverted saucer or dish. The witness stated that this object hovered about 700 yards an hour, and seemed to rock or sway from side to side as it moved. He said that the object appeared to be approximately 30 feet in diameter, and was dark gray or black in color. 

"It was rounded on the bottom, and had a trail of whitish-yellow flame extending about 12 feet behind it. The flame was steady and did not flicker or waver. The object was observed for about 5 minutes, after which it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight."

Reports of civilian sightings have been frequent in this area during the past few months. A number of observers have reported seeing similar objects, varying in size, color, and speed. Many of the sightings are located along the Carolina coast. Latest reports were made last night when there were no clouds and the visibility was excellent.

THE MORRY COUNTY NEWS AID AND ITS LOUIS SENTELL, LORIS, SOUTH CAROLINA, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1953

REPORT SAID SAUCER WAS NOT A "NAVY BLIMP"

Conway, S. C. - Feb. 19 - The "Horry County News" reports that on January 22, notices were only ones who said they did see this formation which a CIA dispatcher says "darn it' actually have flownded" a Navy Blimp.

Lloyd E. Brooks, 32, states he has never seen anything like in all his life. "I'd certainly know a blimp when I saw one," he added.

This man, who was in his yard on the 22nd, says he observed the object slowly over Roobin's farm on the northwest. "It just disappeared as if a light had been turned off," he stated.

High reverends kept the blips lower, Hill said, which was why his parents "spotted" are actually rejects the bill opposing his act according to the basis of his past experience with the air.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT SAYS "LYEN" BAUER WAS NOT A NAVY PILOT (This Loris sentirentp Loris, S. C. 1/27/53)

On the evening of 31 december 1952 at about 7:30 P.M. Mr. Lyen Bauer was driving along US Highway 17 near Conway, South Carolina, approximately 30 miles south of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, when he observed what appeared to be a plane or a blimp, traveling at a high rate of speed, at an altitude estimated at 1000 to 1200 feet.

Both departments the craft as being circular with the contour of a half dollar of somewhat larger size. It seemed to be illuminated from both inside and out, and moved with a jerky and irregular motion, varying its speed and altitude. He saw no wings, tail or other identifying characteristics, and It seemed to disappear over the horizon near Myrtle Beach. No sound was heard.

this grizzling from east to west, the craft were now low in the sky like a half dollar and moving at a tremendous rate of speed northward. It was almost directly above him when it disappeared, and he readily lost sight of it as it went beyond his range of vision. It was about 15 minutes from the time he first noticed the object until it disappeared.

Mr. Bauer estimated that he had driven approximately 15 miles before he finally lost sight of the object, which would indicate a ground speed of around 60 miles per hour for the object.

CAA-man Holt claimed that an investigation of the Blimp, now at Myrtle Beach, would reveal that an antenna had been placed on it. The Air Force denied any connection with the shooting, since they had no aircraft in the area at the time it was reported.

Witnesses all agreed that whatever the object was, it was definitely not a plane or any other known aircraft. One man, visiting in the area, who was a few miles south of Conway, reported the object and a military jet chase of it. Tracked by radar, the unidentified object was estimated to be traveling at approximately 1000 miles per hour.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

HEADQUARTERS OF CHARACTER:

TO: Whom It May Concern:

I have on five occasions sighted a mystifying flying object. The first sighting was on the night of January 29, 1953. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and gave off a brilliant light. It changed direction abruptly and then disappeared. I saw this object on four other occasions. The object is quite different from any aircraft I have ever seen. It is not prone to talk much. It told me about his experience for several days after the incident that occurred.

Known with a large number of the neighbors, including some who have known him intimately for many years, stated that he has always been considered a very reliable and truthful person. None have ever known him to be otherwise. The man is quite normal and friendly in his behavior. He is of good reputation in the community.

A CERTIFIED TRUE COPY

As far as I know from my own investigation, I would say that the report of Mr. Conway is substantial and reliable.
