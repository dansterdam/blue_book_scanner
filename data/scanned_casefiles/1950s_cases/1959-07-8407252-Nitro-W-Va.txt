Seconds from the moment I saw it until
it disappeared into a clump of trees.
Shortly after an airplane at much higher altitude
came over - it was a matter of seconds.
The following day I saw an Air Force
staff car pass along route 35 which is
unfamiliar to that area.

Dear Sir:

On July 10th or several days before or after while I was visiting my father at Nitro, West Virginia, I observed something which I should have reported before but failed to do so. At this time I observed which appeared to me to be two flying saucers; they appeared as two circular discs which gave off a luminous glow and perhaps had a blinking light. I am not familiar with the mechanics or equipment operated by the Air Force but it could have been flares or some other device since a plane came over shortly afterwards.

It was late at night and I would have considered it strictly my imagination but the following morning as I was leaving my home on Air Force staff car passed by which could have been evidence although I would like a reply whether anything was reported in that vicinity. The address is Mr. [redacted]
