March 21, 1962

Dear Sir,

In Feb. 22, 1962 issue of the Cleveland Press, on page B-9, I read an article entitled "Flights and Fliers Flying Saucers Reports Continue to Be Made"

By [redacted], Aviation Writer.

I have a report to make which may be too late to be of importance, but the fact that I saw an unidentified object about a week or two before Thanksgiving Day of 1958 still awes me.

I believe I could give you the exact date if I look up my old files schedule of the

Here is the text from the document:

@trip - I was returning from
Calif. to my home in Cleveland
Ohio, by Greyhound bus
when somewhere in the state
of New Mexico, on a very clear
day, in the distant sky I
saw what appeared to me
to be a flat, round, aluminum type object which
seemed to be sailing away off
into space at a terrifically
fast rate of speed.
I say this because I have
seen airplanes travel at a
very fast rate of speed, in
distant skies - and this
object that I describe was
moving faster than anything
I have ever seen, in the
sky.

I apologize, but the text appears to be written in a very difficult-to-read handwritten script, possibly in reverse or at an angle. While I can see writing on the page, I cannot confidently transcribe the text without potentially introducing errors. The writing looks like cursive or script handwriting that is challenging to decipher through standard OCR methods.

When I came home, I told
my husband about it. In
all this time I doubt if I
have ever discussed this with
more than 3 other people,
altho I have wanted to tell
someone in the aeronautic
field.

Somehow I felt that people
wouldn't believe me.
Another thought was that
actually it would be difficult
to describe the object perfectly.

I only know what I saw
& this is what I am telling
you.

No one, no matter what
they tell me, can convince me
that it was only my
imagination, or a balloon.

or even an airplane,

What I saw was something

I have never seen before.

It was sailing, as tho

one might whisk a saucer

into the air & it would

revolve & sail away at

a fast rate of speed.

Sincerely,

[Redacted name]
