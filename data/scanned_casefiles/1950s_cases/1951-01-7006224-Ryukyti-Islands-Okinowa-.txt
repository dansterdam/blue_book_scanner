AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

D/1 PCS

20,000 turned to E heading of 270 degrees and sighted vapor trail at 11 o'clock, level. At the distance we were from the vapor trail it was impossible to determine the number of vapor trails. It is my belief that there were only one vapor trail which could be seen from that distance. A few degrees and few feet reading for 30 minutes at 2:17. At this point our rate of climb on the vapor was not apparent, there from the 1 o'clock we returned to base and landed.

SUBJECT: Interception Report

TO:     Intelligence Officer

        APO 235

Radar to "A" Flight leader was scrambled at 1910 and completed 8 intercept on B-29 type aircraft given by tower-just and was returning to base low on fuel. At 1925 while cruising at 15,000 feet, we sighted one vapor trail. At approximately 1930 degrees and 14 miles from our position.

The heading of the vapor trail was 045 degrees and altitude 30,000 feet. The distance we were from the vapor trail it was impossible to determine the number of vapor trails. It was by visual contact that we could only see one vapor trail. From what could be seen from that distance, its location was 127 degrees 15 minutes west 35 degrees north, as near as I can estimate. At or near old 1 acre flying field, almost of otherwise, and the source of the vapor trail is unknown to me.
