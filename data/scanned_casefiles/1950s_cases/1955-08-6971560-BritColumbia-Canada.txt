[The rest of the document is very faint and mostly illegible. I can make out a few partial words and fragments, but not enough to confidently reproduce a full text transcription.

The document appears to be a typewritten report with significant degradation and poor image quality, making most of the text unreadable.]

TAB "A"

Mrs. [redacted] Chase, British Columbia, Canada, observed an unidentified object near her home on 9 August 1955. The observation was made on a clear day with only one or two small clouds in the sky. The observation was made between 5 and 6 p.m. with the sun shining brightly.

According to Lt. [redacted] she saw an object, saucer in shape, both on top and bottom with something on top resembling a stack. The object was silver in color and passed from east to west and was under observation for about 20 to 30 seconds.

No change in speed or altitude was noted while under observation. The object was estimated to be at 8,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude and about a quarter of the size of the moon in size. This sighting is the only time such an object has been sighted by this individual according to Lt. [redacted]. This one individual is the only person known to have observed this particular object.
