Originating Agency: Dir Intel                Report No.: 1R52-57        Page 1 of 3

At 1545R, 1 Oct 57, we were informed by ACoIS, G-2 USARCARIB, that Pvt William T. Hannon, 62nd Machine Record Unit, Fort Amador, C.Z., reported sighting an unidentified flying object at 2240R, 21 Sept 57.

Pvt Hannon stated to the reporting officer, that on the night in question, he was behind the Fort Amador Post Exchange which is on the east bank and adjacent to the Panama Canal, when he became aware of a rapidly moving object on the opposite bank. The object appeared to come through a saddle formed by the hill on Fort Kobbe (approximately 2Â½ miles West) and was at a low altitude, starting that it was definitely below the clouds with were reported at 1600 feet. This object made no noise, and appeared to be emitting a phosphorescent or luminescent light over its entire surface. The object was moving in a straight line on a course of approximately 130 degrees. He stated the object was in sight between 5 and 10 seconds during which time it covered an estimated distance of seven miles. The object was similar in size and shape of a C-54 fuselage as seen at 1500 feet at a distance. It disappeared suddenly with an erratic upward movement. Vision was partly obscured at the time by small trees. When he moved to another point, the object had disappeared. During the time the object was in sight, it progressed from a scattered cloud background to clear areas. He said that he spent several minutes studying wind conditions and reflected from the rotating beacon at Albrook in an effort to explain the phenomena. He then attempted to call the radar station without successes. The following morning, Pvt Hannon informed his unit commander of the incident.

A query of the Radar Officer of the 65th AAA Group at Fort Clayton revealed that the station situated on Tobago Island was on watch but had not made any reports of contacts which were in the immediate area. This site was approximately 7 miles across the water from the sighting.

Private Hannon is an intelligent, lucid, individual, with a serious mien.
