28. Did any of the observers have any opinions as to the nature of the target? Yes.

Reported, Joe G. - Pact Jet
Maltzberger, Charles G. - Conventional Plane

29. Additional comments of the observers:

The following information was derived from a report written about the unknown target on Sunday, 25 March 1953:

"A jet target approached land, a great deal of radio interference was observed on the FFI and "A" scopes. From past experience, this was not the weakest conditions or most normal radio interference. Its appearance suggested jamming. Each time the target was about 5 degrees from 10 to 25 miles and from 0 to 10,000 in altitude. When the target appeared again, the interference faded. The target was a Jet plane."

The following was extracted from the ASR Site log, Port Lyautey Naval Station, 25 March 1953:

[A detailed table follows with columns for Time, Bearing, Range, and Remarks, showing various aircraft positions and radio interference details]

COMMENTS of the Preparing Officer:

This report was checked out with all local sites in the area with negative results. A complete coverage was not made since the Naval Station at Port Lyautey did not operate approximately 2120 hours. The initial visual sighting was made at approximately 2123 hours.

2. It would appear significant that the light disappeared at approximately 2215 hours, and according to the radar log maintained at the Port Lyautey Naval Station, the unidentified target being tracked faded at 2215 hours.

3. During the tracking of the unidentified object by the Port Lyautey Naval Station, and upon transferring the available data to a WAC, the object was at no time over the area indicated in the previous report. It is estimated that the object will be located by radar from 10 to 60 miles out from the land area when the ASR site is located.

EMERSON MCMILLIN OBSERVATORY

19 May 53

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB.

Dear Lt. Olsson;

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss Gluck officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each folder. The letter method is has obvious drawbacks. But until that time comes and she can handle my typing and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only 4 really interesting cases. I might mention a 5th, 28 March 53, Scott AFB, which is the 1st report I've seen of an honest to goodness mirage. 6 cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those.

8 April was a meteor.

The Great Falls (3 April) case was Venus if reported time was in error.

28 March Albrook AFB was probably Venus.
31 March Honolulu, and 30 March Lyle, Wash., are puzzling but could possibly have been balloons.
The 8 April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.
This brings us to the interesting cases:
25 March San Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no radar pickup. Was there any aircraft like helicopters that might explain this. Anything more can be on this one? Don't think this is good enough for a pinch-bottle but it should be listed as Nocturnal Meandering Right.

29 March Spooner, Wisc: Duration times needs checking here. Heed to believe that object could have continued some 20 seconds. An interesting case and one of the regular questionnaire fixes should be sent to Mr. Gilette.

Next is the 12 April Stead AFB. I think this is the most interesting case of the batch, and I hope you receive more dope on it. Questionnaires should be sent. I'd like to see Menzel explain this one! Is there any possibility that these could have been aircraft? Apparently ducks have been eliminated. A/C (one) 16 March, Esquimalt AFB although hill, the data are contradictory and insufficient. Perhaps this was a helicopter? We ought to have much more information on this one. Has this been received?

Sincerely,
Allen Hynek

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Directorate of Intelligence
Headquarters 5th Air Division                       23-53                   PAGE    2    OF    8    PAGES

1. The following information was received from 1st Colonel Gilmer K. Walker, Jr., AO 39694, assigned to Headquarters 5th Air Division:

    "Pa. On the night of 25 Mar 53, I acted as pilot on a routine night training flight from Sale Airdromes, French Morocco, to return Sale via Safi, French Morocco.

    "Narrative. French Morocco, Sidi Slimane, French Morocco, Major Norman T. Radis, acting as Instructor Pilot on this night round robin; also aboard was a Lt Fletcher as alternate pilot and the airman engineers, USAF aircraft C-47(?)13 was used for this flight. Following take-off at Sale at 1915Z hours, the flight proceeded at Chonit incident with position reports being furnished Casablanca Air Traffic Control over Safi. French Morocco, at approximately 2035Z hours and directly over Nouasseur at 2120Z hours.

    "b. The position report rendered Casablanca Air Traffic Control at 2120Z was made directly over Nouasseur Air Base at an altitude of 5,000 ft. on a heading of 070°. The aircraft was on automatic pilot at the time and a change in course to 070° was made at this time for the purpose of preventing to Sidi Slimane. The weather conditions were clear and visibility was excellent and there was fairly bright moonlight. There was some evidence of small patches of ground fog in the area. These were relatively few and widely scattered at this time.

    "c. At approximately 2123Z, I observed what appeared to be an approaching aircraft directly ahead at some 2,000 to 3,000 ft. above me. The aircraft was immediately turned to the off position which is customary when passing other aircraft. There were red and green running lights visible, but the light which was detected appeared to be the normal size and intensity of a white aircraft running light. The rate of closure was quite rapid, and the light passed overhead and slightly to the right at approximately 3,000 ft. above our aircraft. There was no evidence of a trail or exhaust of any red or green running lights. Major Radis, who was acting as Instructor Pilot and in the right seat window at the time, also observed the light pass overhead and shortly after turned and remarked to me that this appeared to be a very unusual aircraft light. I immediately made a turn to the left to see if the object could be seen again. Upon completion of this turn, we were almost directly over Nouasseur Air Base at 5,000 ft., and the light was visible at a slightly greater altitude than ours and apparently several miles south of Nouasseur. It was in a turn to the left at this time. We continued to turn and observe the light, which continued to turn above us. During this time, the radius of turn was continually decreased and the speed noticeably diminished. At one time, we were in an extremely tight turn in order to keep the light in sight and eventually were in an extremely tight turn to the right. During this period of some two to three minutes, I had contacted Casablanca Air Traffic Control and requested any information as to traffic reported over Nouasseur, receiving a negative reply. I contacted Nouasseur tower and inquired if there were any known traffic at this time. The reply was negative."

"No. To the best of my knowledge, there was no meteorological condition units could account for this sighting. At no time was there any evidence of form or shape to the object. It was particularly noticeable because the dark outlines of the other two craft were clearly visible."

"1. At no time was there any direct movement on the part of the object which could indicate an attempted interception of our aircraft, nor did we take any lateral actions against our aircraft. As pointed out earlier, there were two other aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the sighting, but both of these were observed and their position noted while watching the course of the unidentified object."

"2. The movement of this object was observed almost entirely during the period in question by all three officers aboard the aircraft including myself. At one time during the contact with Nouasseur tower we were advised of the observation lights 1.6 miles above our base. Then we were asked to fix the location of the object in relation to these lights. I estimate this location to be 200 to 300 yards north and 150 to 200 yards of the observation lights in question. These lights were clearly visible during the entire time we were in the vicinity of Nouasseur."

"2. The following information was received from Major Norman I. Radda, AO 302326, assigned to Headquarters 5th Air Division:"

"a. A C-47 aircraft No. 9181, flying a routine training mission from Sale to Safi, Nouasseur, Sidi Slimane and returning to Sale, was flying a 710 course as 5,000 feet from Nouasseur to Sidi Slimane when a white light was sighted over Nouasseur Air Base. At the time of the initial sighting, our air speed indicator was 155 miles per hour. In Gol Aaiun we altered course on automatic, then the sighting was made, he immediately changed to manual operation."

"b. When we first sighted the object, we assumed the light came from another aircraft in the vicinity because we had passed a number of aircraft during the flight. On closer observation of the object and inquiries to Casablanca and Nouasseur Control Tower, we believed it was something other than a light from a conventional aircraft."

"c. The object first passed to the right of the plane at approximately 1,500 feet above our aircraft at high speed. He then circled in the area of Nouasseur Air Base with its tail toward the south. During the course of one or three turns, I looked to the south and observed the object moving in a northerly direction at approximately 12,000 feet. We then called Casablanca Control who in turn approved to know the location of all aircraft. They had no record of aircraft in that vicinity at that altitude. We continued to circle for approximately 15 minutes and observed the object making a pattern similar to an aircraft traffic pattern at Nouasseur Air Base and the object stopped near the south end of the runway. Another C-47 was then making a final approach."

"d. We reported to Nouasseur tower and then departed for Sidi Slimane Air Base. Approximately 30 miles northwest of Nouasseur, we were requested to return to aid in attempting to locate the object. We had been sighted. We then rerouted and observed the object in the same position of rest about 1.5 miles south of the runway near two red lights in construction markers. We circled the object for approximately 45 minutes and were in contact with Nouasseur tower during this time."

"e. A ground crew was sent out in a jeep to locate the object from the air strip. We first saw a flare to identify the spot and then lost sight of the object making a pass over the object. The fog started rolling in and we lost sight of the object. The Nouasseur tower indicated by phone that a C-47 was on the ground and could only account for one aircraft in the area."

3. The following information was received from 1st Lt. Leo C. Fletcher, AO 649385, assigned to Headquarters 5th Air Division:

"a. The light was first observed at a position just five miles northeast of Nouasseur Air Base at an approximate altitude of 7,000 feet on a leading or approximately 200 an a heading 212. The only indication at this time was a rather bright yellow white light. No other running lights, or features, were visible. Estimated ground speed about 100-300 miles per hour. The maneuvers seemed to be conventional with no particular erratic movements.

"b. After passing overhead, and slightly to right of our aircraft, the light circled behind us and began descending in a series of spirals. The descent was fairly rapid and when near the runway appeared to slow abruptly and on reaching a point approximately 1.5 miles south of Nouasseur Air Base, appeared to drop. The light remained stationary at this point until our aircraft departed and at times varied in intensity; however, with no particular time interval. Ground fog began forming at about 2245 hours and light was no longer visible.

"c. Weather at time of sighting was clear with no cloud formations in view.

"d. Attempt was made to locate light for ground party from Nouasseur Air Base, but no report was received of results of search."

4. The following Controllable Special Journal was received from the Directorate of Operations, Headquarters 5th Air Division:
