AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

Top of the document shows:
- Date of Report: 16 February 1955
- Date of Activity: 15 February 1955
- Location: San Diego, California

Most of the specific details in the body of the report are redacted (blacked out), making the text illegible.

The document is marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" at both the top and bottom of the page.

There is a signature or signature-like marking at the bottom right of the document.

The document appears to be an Air Force intelligence report with multiple sections, but the specific content is not readable due to redactions.


- page 13 -

The document appears to be an "UNCLASSIFIED" form marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" with multiple sections redacted (blacked out). The top of the document has several fields, but most text is obscured by black redaction marks. The document looks like an official government form, likely from the 1950s based on the filename, but the specific details are not readable due to the extensive redactions.


- page 14 -

The text in this image is largely illegible due to poor image quality and heavy shadowing. The only clearly visible text is:

"UNCLASSIFIED"
"FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY"

at the top and bottom of the document. The rest of the text appears to be blurred and cannot be accurately transcribed.


- page 15 -

The document is marked "UNCLASSIFIED" and "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" at the top and bottom of the page. However, the text on the page is largely illegible due to poor image quality and scanning resolution. A signature appears at the bottom of the document, but the details cannot be clearly read.
