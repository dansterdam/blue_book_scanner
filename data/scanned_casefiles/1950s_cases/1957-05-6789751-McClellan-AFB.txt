At 10252, 4 May 57, while on a routine Airborne Operation Center mission, 2/Lt. Lloyd M. Martin, Co-pilot, sighted a meteor-like object at 9 o'clock, approximately 10,000 feet going in an east-west direction. At 10037 an object of the same description passed in almost the same area, approximately 3,000 feet south. The objects were described as similar to a "Patterson or F-102" total area based on location. Are reported no known aircraft were in the area. Two USN submarines were operating in the area at the sighting. Crew members speculated the UFO's may have been rockets from a nearby damaged area.
