1. Under provisions of AFR Letter 200-2, 11 April 1951, the following is a narrative report by this unit on interviews with Captain USAF...

2. On 6 December 1951 at approximately 1920 hours, Captain USAF, pilot, was flying at an altitude of approximately four (4) miles southwest of the Niagara Falls Municipal Airport, Buffalo, New York, when he sighted an unconventional-type airborne object.

3. This object was larger, white, extremely brilliant (in comparison to the 20-30 military aircraft in the area which were first lighted) and appeared much larger than its perimeter area, was a blue-white brilliance and the outer edge outlined in a fiery, tapered cone and after the cone there appeared some pulsating, red-orange exhaust flame. The exhaust appeared to be short duration.

4. After sighting the object for approximately 15 seconds, it slowed down and started to climb in a steep sharp angle and appeared to have a blinking light on the top. He could not be sure whether this was a light or an external blinking light bulb. At the extreme altitude to which the object climbed, it appeared as a brilliant, glowing, circular light of about 1/4 to 1/2 the size of a dime at arm's length. It was self-luminous, had no perceptible wings or stabilizers, and made no sound associated with it.

5. The AACS station in this area reported nothing in its log to indicate the presence of the object at the time of the sighting. A check was made at the time control tower, but they had no information on this object, nor do they have anything indicated in their tower log.

In-bound traffic - Capitol Airlines, Flight 775, inbound from Rochester, N. Y., landed 1912 and departed 1917. American Airlines, Flight 707, inbound from Rochester, landed 1913 and departed 1920. Both of the above flights were VFR.

7. Weather Station at Buffalo, New York, records the following:

Buffalo was as follows: 1735, 1200 ft. broken clouds, 10 miles visibility. Wind at 16 knots, temperature 20, dewpoint 16, altimeter 3009 ft, scattered clouds at 3100 ft, scattered clouds at 500 ft. 2000 ft overcast, temperature 22, winds aloft: winds 0 degrees at 10 knots, temperature 1000 ft. 2000 degrees at 20 knots, 6000 ft. 200 degrees at 20 knots, 8000 ft. 260 degrees at 30 knots.
