SUBJECT: Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft

TO:   Commanding General

      Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

      ATTN: MCIS

1. Under provisions of ADC Letter 200-1, 11 April 1951, the following is a narrative report by this unit as derived from an interview with Captain [REDACTED], USAF.

2. On 10 December 1951, Captain [REDACTED] was driving east on Como Park Boulevard, approximately four (4) miles southeast of the Buffalo Municipal Airport, Buffalo, New York. At 1820B he sighted an unconventional-type airborne object.

3. The object was large, white, extremely brilliant (he compared its brilliance to the light of a welder's torch when first lighted) and globular in shape, with an estimated 100 ft. diameter. The center, brighter than its perimeter area, was a blue-white brilliance and the outer edge was a white brilliance. Emanating from the trail of the object was a fleary, tapered cone and after the cone passed, some pulsating, red-orange exhaust flashes. The exhaust trail appeared to be about one-quarter of a mile in length. Captain [REDACTED] estimated the altitude of the object to be from three to four thousand feet. He estimated the speed to be approximately 240 knots. Its flight path appeared to be from south to north.

4. After sighting the object for approximately 15 seconds, it disappeared in the immediate vicinity of the Buffalo Municipal Airport. Captain [REDACTED] stated that it just seemed to shut-off, as one would shut-off an electric light bulb. Although Captain [REDACTED] heard the whisper of his car down, he could hear no sound associated with the object.

5. The ADC station in this area reported nothing in its log to indicate the presence of the object at the time of the sighting. A check was made at the airport control tower, Buffalo Airport, and nothing was observed by the operators on duty at the time of the sighting, nor was anything indicated in the tower log.

8. Captain is an experienced military pilot. He served overseas as a USAF fighter pilot during World War II. Since that time, he has been flying fighters in the USANG until the unit in which he was serving was activated into Federal service in February 1951. Since activation of his unit, he has served as a flight leader as well as the unit instrument training officer.
