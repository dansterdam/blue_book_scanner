Unidentified Aircraft Sighting
1200 hours, 24 August, 1953

This is to confirm a verbal statement made by the Superintendent of Air
Navigation to you on 24 August, 1953.

2.   Mr. [redacted] reports as follows:

"At 1200 hours on Sunday, 24 August, 1953, I was in the vicinity of the Marine
Base Workshops, Port Moresby, when I noticed a cloud building up as though
being formed by vapour trails, in roughly a South-Westerly direction from Port
Moresby, at a very great height.

I watched this cloud, which grew in intensity for several minutes, when
suddenly an object appeared from one side of it and climbed very fast in
roughly a North-Westerly direction. I could give no accurate information
as to the shape or possible size of this object, as it appeared slightly
larger than a pin head, but whatever its was, it was a very clearly defined
vapour trail behind it until it finally disappeared with a rapid gain of
altitude.

I had my movie camera with me and photographed the whole thing on the tele-
photo lens. I am waiting the result of the photograph in an endeavour to
ascertain what the object might have been. It appeared to me to be some type
of very high speed aircraft.

As far as I know, Air Traffic Control knew of no aircraft movements in that
area, and in any case, from the extreme altitude of the object, it certainly
could not have been a civil aircraft.

Weather conditions at the time were cloudless*.

We do not know of any aircraft of the operational performance implied by this

AREA REPORTED ON: Bermuda 32 22 N - 64 14 W     FROM (Agency): Intelligence Officer, 534 SRS, Med. Wea.

PREPARED BY (Orgn): Capt. J. de Toledo, Captain, Intel OFF                 EVALUATION: A-6

SUMMARY: (Describe summary of report. Give highlights in first and succeeding paragraphs. List indorsers at lower left. Begin last of report on AF Form 112a-Part II)

At approximately 1330 hours, 26 August 1953, 1st Lt Norman R. Levine, 534 Strategic Air Command Weather Detachment, was driving on base in a southwesterly direction. Off to his right over the field at an altitude of about 5-10,000 feet he noted the sun reflecting from a silvery object, cylindrical in shape, approximately 150 inches in length. In shape, he observed it to be hovering. He could see the edge and part of the underside of it. As he continued to watch it (driving way slowly) it began to move in a lateral line, with changing angles to him. As it changed shape, he observed it to be somewhat wedge-shaped with a thin, almost transparent tail. It had no wing, tail, windows or visible means of propulsion. He kept it in view from (1) to five (5) seconds and it suddenly disappeared, not completely as an object, but curiously and entirely in a sort of "translucent" manner. He stopped his car and looked around but it had completely disappeared. The sky was clear with just a few (2) or (3) clouds in the vicinity. A light wind was blowing.

Interviewed made immediately came to my office, and told me what had happened. Together we reviewed the circumstances of his sighting. To me it was a considered observation of my. Together we agreed the sky to no avail, it being about five (5) miles since his sighting. Cleared about premeditated opinions as to flying saucers he did not appear to be excited, although he failed their occurrence to do so if it actually happened as he described. All became of the nature and type of reports he would remain skeptical until he actually saw one himself. He thinks it might have been a balloon or something similar.

Not a scientific sighting and not one to jump to conclusions Lieutenant Levine is a highly reliable, twenty-eight years of age, with the aid of glasses which were worn during the sighting. He is an excellent vision.

However, it is my opinion that because of his quiet conclusion as to what he had seen and his general reaction to his sighting, in effect, he was so responsive check.

There had been no weather balloons released within two (2) hours prior to the sighting, there were no reports from any airplanes within the vicinity, nor did the position in the tower nor anyone else on base report anything unusual.
