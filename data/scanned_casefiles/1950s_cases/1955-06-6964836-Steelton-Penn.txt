One (1), cigar and (or) egg shaped object,
white, with a level flight path was observed
for a period of ten (10) minutes over Steelton,
Pa.

11. COMMENTS
Due to the time of sighting, the dis-
cription of the sighting (changing of
shape), and the possibility of the
object being a balloon and the improb-
ability of further investigation un-
covering data of significant value, no
further investigations authorized by
this headquarters (4502d AISS).
