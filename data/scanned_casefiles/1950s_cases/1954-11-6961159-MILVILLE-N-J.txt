THIS WAS THE ONLY REPORT RECEIVED ON THIS INCIDENT AND NO

CAUSE COULD BE DETERMINED. MRS [REDACTED] CONTACTED BY PHONE, COULD NOT

GIVE OTHER
THAN A VAGUE DESCRIPTION OF SHAPE, ETC. IT IS NOTED THAT
AN OBJECT AS DESCRIBED HERE ACTUALLY
RECENT OTHERS IN A CITY THE
SIZE OF MILLVILLE, N. WOULD HAVE TRACED IT, ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE LOW
ALTITUDE DESCRIBED. IT IS FURTHER DEEMED BY THIS OFFICER THAT THE
OBJECT WAS AN OPTICAL ILLUSION CREATED BY THE CLOUDY CONDITIONS WITH
CARGO LIGHTS PLAYING ABOUT.
