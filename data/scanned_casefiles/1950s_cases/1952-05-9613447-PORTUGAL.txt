Tuesday was 13 May

The Director of Security, MATS, states that the following information was reported in the daily Acores newspaper, "Correio da Terceira" on 17 May 1952:

"Last Tuesday at 11 o'clock strange things took place in the sky over Santarem, Alcobertas, Caldas da Palhava and Torres. The description transmitted to the "Diario" de Noticias" vary in nature, but from which we transcribe the most probable: "IT WAS AN AIRPLANE", they said in Certaxo. At about 11 o'clock on this day, an airplane apparently appeared in the sky from the OTA side at a great altitude. It was made of aluminum or was painted in that color, and had an intense reflec-tion. During a half hour period, it made maneuvers near this village, making strange movements, splitting smoke that formed various designs; such as circles, squares, uneven lines and broken lines, some of which were momentarily like the trail of a rocket. The airplane sometimes travelled slowly and sometimes with unbelievable speed and at a certain time started making extraordinary acrobatics, spinning and always in a circular course from OTA towards the West. Finally, after it had been seen by hundreds of persons during the half hour period, the airplane disappeared almost abruptly in the direction of OTA, leaving clouds of smoke suspended in the air which remained there for more than an hour and a half. After the strange craft disappeared, two fighter aircraft appeared from the direction of Paiva, which after flying under the smoke clouds went in the direction of OTA also. The happening was commented in the most varied comments, leaving imagination. While some stated that the smokes were "Signals from heaven", others stated that they were just another case of the "Flying Lisas", among the witnesses, a correspondent of the "Diario de Noticias", stated that it was an airplane, which he distinguished clearly in its shape of the altitude at which it took place, and it was the only things strange were the incredible movements, the speed and the smoke."

Security Officer's Comment: The towns of Santarem, Alcobertas, Caldas da Rainha, Torres and Certaxo are located northeast of Lisbon. It is a possibility that the craft observed could be one of the new jet aircraft, which has been delivered to Portugal under the provision of NATO, however, no reference was made such in the local newspapers.
