SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT, Subj: Report of Unidentified Aerial Object by Major General U. S. Marine Corps, Retired, 22 July 1954 at Coronado, California.

Advised that, while standing in front of his home on Glorietta Boulevard at exactly 0811 hours on this morning, he had heard the sound of an object which appeared to be proceeding slightly southwest at a speed which he estimated to be three to four miles per hour. General stated that he could make no estimation of the altitude, nor describe the object making the sound, as he did not see it as originally reported, but had heard its sound only. He said that the sound appeared to be above the overcast, which he estimated to be at 1500 feet with 700 feet scattered, and visibility six miles. General further stated that he considered the sound he heard important enough to report, as during his 25 years in Marine aviation, he had become acquainted with the sound of jets, rockets, and artillery shells, and that the sound he had heard did not seem to be any of these and appeared to come from an object traveling as fast or faster than an artillery shell. General went into his house, checked the time by telephone, and then reported the matter telephonically to the Duty Officer at the Naval Air Station.

3. ACTION: No similar reports relative to this matter were received, and no action was taken as a result of this report by this District Office.
