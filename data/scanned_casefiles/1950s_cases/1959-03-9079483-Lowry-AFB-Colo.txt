It had a slight vapor trail, which was about twice the diameter of the object, trailing behind the object. The object moved at a fairly rapid rate of speed, much faster than the object. The center of the object was orange while the outer portion and the vapor trail were yellow. The object had no discernible details, and no sound was noted. The distance to the object could not be definitely determined, but it was believed to be at least one mile away. It was at an elevation of about 30 to 40 degrees from the horizontal.

The object was in view slightly to the right front of his car, and almost directly above.
