IN REPLY
REFER TO: 2D 240-156                                                MAR 5 1959

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting on 2 March 1959 at 0030 Hours by [redacted] Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

TO: Commander
McGuire Air Force Base
Trenton, New Jersey

1. Reference is made to paragraph 4b of AFR 200-2, dated 5 February 1958.

2. On 2 March 1959, this District Office was telephonically advised by Special Agent RICHARD SWANENBURG of Detachment 304, OSI, Custom House, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of the following information, which was furnished to him by Mr. [redacted] Philco Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who is employed by the Philco Corporation, Abbotsford and Wisahickon Streets, Philadelphia. SWANENBURG stated that [redacted] 26 years of age, has an M.E. degree from Rutgers University, and appears to be a responsible person.

3. [redacted] that he had sighted a spherical object, which appeared to be about the size of a nickel or a quarter when held in the hand at arm's length. A slight vapor trail, which in length was about twice the diameter of the object, trailed behind it. The vapor trail was about the same width or slightly narrower than the object. The center or the object was orange-yellow. The object had no discernible details, and no sound was noted. The distance to the object could not be estimated; however, it was believed to be at least one mile away.

[redacted] first noted the object through the windshield of his car. It was at an elevation of approximately 25° on a downward path, and disappeared behind trees in the distant horizon. During the latter portion of its flight, before disappearing the object appeared to waver in flight. The object was in view for three to four seconds. It was traveling alone in his car, and observed the object without visual aids. At the time of the sighting was on the Franklin Park cutoff road about 200 yards from U.S. Route 1, approximately 4 miles south of New Brunswick, New Jersey; and noted that he was heading in a direction south, southeast, and noted

the object a little to his right. He therefore believed the object was approximately south when observed. _______ stated that the sky was clear at the time he observed the object and that this observation took place at approximately 0030 hours on 2 March 1959.

k. William S. Barnett, 1/Lt, USAF, Assistant Intelligence Officer, Headquarters, New York Air Defense Sector, McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey. Information obtained has a wrap-around windshield.

It is possible that a wrap-around windshield was a reflection of some light source in the windshield which was distorted to appear as an unidentified object. The report was made approximately eight hours after the sighting and the time of "three to four seconds" was a remembered time. No responsible person by this time had been the initial report.

2. Attached as an inclosure is the summary of the preliminary report as prepared by a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigation which was forwarded to this office.
