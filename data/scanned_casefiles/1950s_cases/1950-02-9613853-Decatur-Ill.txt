Good Thunder, Minnesota
Feb. 26-1952.

Project Saucer; Wright-Patterson Field.
Dayton, Ohio-

Dear Sirs:- My husband asked me to report to you!— As we were returning home from Miami, Florida, on Sunday, P.M. between 2:00 P.M. and 3:00 P.M. on Highway U.S. 36, driving west from Decatur, Ill. to Springfield- we saw something to the left front of us- as of a silver flash, like we sometimes see when the sun strikes a plane- but, as we watched, there was no plane in sight- just the silver streak about as high as the usual planes fly- we watched for a plane, anywhere in that corner of the sky- but didn't see a thing.-

We thought someone else might have seen it slow and reported to you- would be interested in any information you could give us.

Yours truly-
Mrs [redacted]

OTHER PLANETS SEND
SAUCERS, NAVY MAN SAYS

NEW YORK, Feb. 22 (UP)—A Navy commander
said today he is convinced that flying saucers are real
space ships piloted by strangers from other planets.

Comdr. Robert B. McLaughlin, guided missiles
expert and current skipper of the destroyer Bristol,
told of two saucers, 20 inches in diameter, outrunning
a Navy rocket.

In an article in the March issue of True magazine,
the commander, identified by the magazine as an
Annapolis graduate and head of the Navy unit work-
ing on classified projects at White Sands Proving
Grounds, N.M., said he is convinced "these disks are
space ships from another planet, operated by animate,
intelligent beings."
