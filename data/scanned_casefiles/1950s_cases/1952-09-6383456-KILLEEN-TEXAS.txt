Flying Saucer Report

19 September 1952

At approximately 0438 hours on 17 September 1952, Cpl Harold M. Blair, EA 15 425 378, Military Police Company, 846th AW, Killeen Base, Killeen, Texas observed a flying saucer type object fly over post 33 where he was sentry on duty.

Blair gave the following information during an interview with the undersigned: Daylight had not as yet broken to a very dark and Blair was looking upward observing the stars when he saw an object at approximately 1000 feet altitude fly directly over his head. The object was described as about 10 to 12 feet across, no windows, no doors, and no (2) six foot red flames protruding from the rear. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 seconds at an estimated speed of 700 to 800 miles per hour. Approximately 2 seconds after the sixth, a peculiar sound, something like a model airplane engine, was heard. The object was traveling from Southwest to Northeast.

Blair has had no experience as an aircraft observer, or no experience in astronomy.

This drawing is a re-production of the sketch made by Blair.

[The document includes a hand-drawn sketch of an object with "Green Fluorescent Glow" and "Red Flame" labeled]
