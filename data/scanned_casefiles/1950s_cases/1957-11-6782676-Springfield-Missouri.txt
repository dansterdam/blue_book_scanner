There is also a handwritten note on the right side of the page that appears to read: "No elevation or azimuth given making it impossible to properly isolate. However, the sighting wraps probably a conventional object in some interpretation of it."

Dear Sir, Referring to an article in our last issue and to the "Flying Saucers" I have decided to write to you about an incident that has puzzled us since Victoria Day, Nov. 11, 1957. Then we were at 9:30 PM when my husband returned home from a meeting in Springfield. He and called to me to come outside to see something. He rushed

out and stood by the garage looking a bright object slowly approaching from the west. It seemed to be egg-shaped, near 1/2 length by 12 wide judging it by the size of 1/2 our side. We were on a farm seven mi. southwest of Joplin.

The light inside the object was so bright it was blinding but I do remember noticing the no-angle or framework and trying to hard to distinguish some objects inside as it seemed to have passed round justly at about 100 yards from us. I was hard a paint flurr of a motor and it seemed on way to TL.

southwest one was out of sight for
seconds leaving us standing there
in amazement wondering what we
had really seen. Thinking then
would be setting near on the 32*
at 10:00 PM in now disbanded
that there was no matter made up
it and not a neighbor or anyone
that we told about it. Had seen
anything unusual. I made notes
about the incident, thinking some time
I would learn the proper agency
to which it should be reported.

Are you have anything or know
of sighting of objects on that date?
We would be much to learn more about
this strange event.
