Dear Sir,

Your letter of July 5, 1954 has been received and the contents careuily noted. 
Flying saucers do not have to write to you about an incident that has puzzled us since Victoria Kr May 11, 1954 -- 7:30 
P.M. when my wife and myself noticed a strange speeding luminous object in the Springfield mo. area. The object was heading northeast at a very high rate of speed, and leaving a trail of light behind it. The incident lasted approximately 30 seconds. I would like to come and talk to you about this incident if you have the time. Let me know.

the first thing observed was a bright light which appeared of the size of a harvest moon and seemed to be coming direct to us at an terrific speed. As it drew nearer in apparent size and brilliance it appeared to be hovering rather motionless but when first observingthere was a slight perceptible movement upward of say six to eight feet as if rising over some obstruction. the light itself emitted a brilliant white light and from its outlines appeared to be almost circular but in brilliant flashes gave evidence of a slight oblong shape. It did not appear to be enclosed within a frame or surrounding but seemed to be a solid mass of light. When it reached a point estimated around 200 to 300 feet from us and directly overhead it suddenly shut off leaving darkness as it went out. this phenomenon was repeated around three times within a period of some 10 to 12 minutes after which time it appeared to go north and away at a tremendous speed.
