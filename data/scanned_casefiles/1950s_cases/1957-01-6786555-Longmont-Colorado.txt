ATIC FORM 329 (REV 26 SEP 52)

The text in the image is largely illegible due to the handwritten nature and poor scan quality. However, I can make out a few partial words and elements:

At the top right, there is a postmark or stamp that says "DAY HOPE" and "INSUFFICIENT DATA"

There is a number "3" circled on the left side of the document.

The top left has some handwritten markings including what appears to be "14 hrs 7-22"

Most of the handwritten text in the body of the document is too blurry and cursive to accurately transcribe with confidence.
