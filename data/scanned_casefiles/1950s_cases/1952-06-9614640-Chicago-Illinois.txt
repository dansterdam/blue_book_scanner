"On 27 June 1952, Captain JACK WEBB, 109th CIC Detachment
Louisville, Kentucky, advised that Special Agent BERNARD G. DANIEL,

DEPP is a former major (USAF) Ret'd and presently a Lt. Colonel
in the Kentucky National Guard. DEPP stated that he saw his first
flying saucers on 23 June 1952 at approximately 1000 hours. The
sighting took place 3 miles SSE of Owensboro on U.S. Highway No.
60. DEPP was walking north when he heard a noise similar to a flight
of aircraft at high altitude. Upon looking up and ahead of the noise,
he saw two round objects resembling giant saucer-like objects that reflected
the sun in a yellow-lavenderish light. The objects were proceeding
north, flying in trail (one behind the other) and passed out of
sight in an about five (5) seconds. DEPP estimated the objects were
at 15 to 20 thousand feet altitude. The sighting took place on a
very bright, clear day. DEPP added that he was accompanied by
C. G. FRYE, who saw only one of the objects. No further pertinent information was obtained from DEPP by Special Agent DANIEL."
