so that he was certain that the same phenomenon was under discussion; that the sun was setting at the time, and, although he could not see the jet aircraft themselves, he assumed from the characteristics of the sighting he led that jet aircraft were actually involved; that he was led to this conclusion by prior experience of jet sightings; and that he would describe the sighting as "the reflection of the sun on the exhaust of two jets." Sunset was agreed on 17 Jan 58 that he and SPERA had observed the same phenomenon, but was unprepared to lend personal credence to the view that he actually had been of jet aircraft, and equally unprepared to say that the sighting definitely was or was not a jet aircraft; he simply stated that the phenomenon remained unexplained to him. Actual sunset on 16 Jan 58 was at 1759 hours.

12. Physical Evidence: None.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Description of objects and circumstances indicates that they probably were non-persistent contrails from a formation of two jet aircraft. Sun's position low on horizon could have caused the coloration.
