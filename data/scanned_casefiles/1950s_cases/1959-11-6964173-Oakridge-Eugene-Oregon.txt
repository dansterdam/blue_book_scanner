Here is the text from the document:

(6) None.

(7) See (2), above.

h. Northern Lights were visible. Venus and several other bright stars were visible on the horizon. The observers at Oakridge and Eugene decided that Venus was the object they had seen.

i. The object was reported to the 460th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, but no interception was attempted because of the poor weather conditions at Portland International Airport. The radar sites in the area were alerted but no return could be detected.

j. None known.

k. Helicopter pilot, George V. Lawler, 1st Lt., USAF, 42794.

(1) An airliner over Eugene, Oregon was contacted but the crew could see nothing unusual in the Mount Hood area.

(2) Officer Olson first observed the UFO when he was about five miles West of Government Camp. It was moving slowly to the South. He then drove up to Timberline and observed that the UFO was just slightly higher than he was. He thought he was at 11,000 feet and the object at about 12,000 feet. Actually he was at about 6500 feet.

(3) The FAA Tower at Portland had no report of UFOs from any aircraft during this time period. No aircraft were known to be in the sighting area.

(4) Officer Olson reported the UFO to be so bright that he could clearly see it while he had on his sunglasses.

(5) The presence of Aurora Borealis and Venus other bright stars in this area of the sky seems to point a possible cause of this phenomenon. The observers reports seem to conflict and since some people looking for the UFO could not find it, optical illusion seem to be indicated.
