27 FEBRUARY 1954, KEESLER AIR FORCE BASE, MISSISSIPPI

Three members of the military at Keesler AFB, Mississippi reported sighting an unidentified flying object on the night of 27 February 1954. The object appeared to be solid and round, giving off a bright incandescent light. The object was in view for approximately five seconds, followed a straight course, and split in two before disappearing.

All characteristics point to that of a meteor entering the earth's atmosphere.

12 February 1954

Case 4. On February 12th I think the year was 1954. A U. S. Air Force Strategic Bomber was on an arctic training, 141st, exploded at 55,000 feet, killing two of the four crew members. The other two, Lieutenants Colonel K. G. McGrow and Captain L. E. Eyton, survived miraculously from the plane as it disintegrated. Both revived in time to open their parachutes....Neither of the survivors could say what had happened. There had not been an instant's warning before the explosion.
