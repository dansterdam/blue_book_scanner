27 FEBRUARY 1954, KEESLER AIR FORCE BASE, MISSISSIPPI
Three members of the military at Keesler AFB, Mississippi reported sighting an unidentified flying object on the night of 27 February 1954. The object appeared to be solid and around 15 to 20 feet in diameter. It was observed for about five seconds, followed a straight course, and split in two before disappearing.
ALL CHARACTERISTICS POINT TO THAT OF A METEOR ENTERING THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

Information Only
Source:

Case 4. On 13 January 1954, I think the year was 1954 - at the Keesler Air Force Base, four civilian employees of the 3987th Training Squadron observed four circular objects. The objects were disc-shaped, varying in size, and moving at an extremely high rate of speed. The witnesses were Captain E.C. McGraw and Captain L. B. Sparks. It was also reported from the plane as an unidentified object. Both officers were in line to open evidence concerning this case, but were instructed not to do so. They could not say what had happened. There had not been an article in the newspaper before the explosion.
