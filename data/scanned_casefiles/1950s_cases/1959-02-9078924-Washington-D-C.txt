TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

UNCLASSIFIED - Declassified by Order of the President

Report ID: 1959-02-9078924
Subject: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting
Location: Washington, D.C.
Date: February 9, 1959

On the evening of February 9, 1959, at approximately 7:30 PM, several residents of Washington, D.C. reported seeing an unidentified flying object in the sky. The object was described as a bright, elliptical-shaped light that moved rapidly and silently across the night sky.

One witness, a local businessman, was able to photograph the object using a 35mm camera. The attached photograph shows the object as it appeared in the sky.

The Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation team was notified and responded to the scene. After a thorough investigation, the object could not be identified and was classified as an unidentified flying object (UFO).

No further details are available at this time. The case remains open and under investigation by Project Blue Book.

The image contains a handwritten letter on the letterhead of "Venda - Companhia de Maquinas Automaticas, Lda." The letter mentions that the writer has enclosed a photograph which they took while visiting the U.S. in early February. They state that the photograph shows something, but they are unable to provide any details about it, as they have been instructed not to discuss anything they saw. The writer indicates that the photograph was likely enlarged from a smaller original.

Dear Sir,

Enclosed is a photograph which I took while on a visit to the U.S. in early February. 
It was taken at about 9 P.M. on 4/12/59. At the time I took the picture that was no light visible (Capt. of Pentagon) as I thought it may be. I cannot furnish you with anything I saw, as I have been instructed not to mention the details of this photograph.
Nearly sixteen months elapsed from the time of the taking of the original copy prints. I did not notice the enlargements before I would have sent a copy of the photograph.
Yours sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

The image contains a photograph of a UFO, as described in the memo from ATTIC (4425) on 21 July 1959. The memo states that the photograph was recently submitted for interpretation and analysis. The photograph is said to show a UFO that was sighted. The memo recommends obtaining the original negative for a more detailed analysis if desired.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

Memo, ATTIC (4425), 21 July 59. Photograph of UFO

TO: AFOIN-4D4a

1. The photograph which you recently submitted for interpretation and analysis has been examined. The photograph was printed to determine if it contains any significant data other than a portrayal of a UFO (unidentified flying object), precluding a detailed photographic analysis.

2. The high-colored spot in the sky portion of the photograph does appear to be an image rather than a scratch or other blemish on the negative.

3. If a detailed analysis is desired, it is recommended that the original negative be obtained.
