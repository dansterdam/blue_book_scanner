It is believed that this picture was taken from one of the many cases which run sight-seeing tours in Washington, DC. The image at the top is probably a reflection of one of the many lights which are apparent in the area. In the instance of all the other lights the glare on which it is mounted is apparent. In the case of the enlightened blocs on the left of the photo, they even stand out like with out the benefit of direct light.

This case includes one(W) 5½" x 3½" photograph and one (1) 8½" x 4" negative


- page 5 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a nighttime scene with a bright white object or light in the center, surrounded by smaller scattered lights against a dark background. The photograph is mounted on a white page with some small specks or dust visible.

Dear Sir,

Enclosed is a photograph which I took while on a visit to the U.S. in Early February. It was taken at about 9 P.m. on 4/2/59.

At the time I took the Picture there was no light visible, (left of Pentagon) & so I thought if it may be of interest to you, as I cannot reconcile the object with anything I saw. This film was only recently printed (enlarged from 35-mm) & in the Original copy printing I did not notice this object, or I would have sent a copy of the Photograph sooner.

Yours Sincerely,
[Signature blacked out]

Memo, ATIC (WBSg), 21 July 59, Photograph of UFO
1st Ind (AFCIN-NDSa)                                                3 August 1959

TO:   AFCIN-LRSg

1. The photograph which you recently submitted for interpretation and
analysis has been examined. The photograph was printed to an extreme
contrast (all black or white with little gray tone), precluding a definitive photo-analysis.

2. The light-colored spot in the sky portion of the photograph does appear
to be an image rather than a scratch or some other inadvertent mar on the
negative.

3. If a detailed analysis is desired, it is recommended that the original
negative be obtained.
