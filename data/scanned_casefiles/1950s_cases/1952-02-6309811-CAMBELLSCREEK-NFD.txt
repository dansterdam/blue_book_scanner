Roy himself reported in February, 1952 observing three bright silver discs or spheres in exact V-formation, which moved slowly to the zenith, hovered for a moment, changed formations and then dashed away at breathtaking speed. The objects were large-about half the diameter of the sun, and were seen at 3 P.M. in the afternoon against a deep blue sky. The objects appearance and behavior left him in an emotion of shock, at that time.
