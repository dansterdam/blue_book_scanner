In addition to the above party, a number of other persons were present on the pier and witnessed the same occurrence. However, the identities of the other witnesses are not known.

At approximately 2:15 pm the object was first observed. It was described as a bright, shiny, metallic object, oval in shape, and about the size of a large automobile. It was estimated to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet and was traveling in a northeast direction at a high rate of speed.

The object was under observation for about one minute and then suddenly disappeared from sight. This was in full view of the party and other witnesses on the pier, and no trails or other evidence of the object's passage were observed. The party agreed that the object was not an aircraft, balloon, or any other known type of aerial vehicle.

REFERENCES: (Indicate previous reports, statements, sketches, etc., if any):
SUMMARY: [Content redacted]
2. Object sited: The object appeared to be circling and appeared to be the size of a B-29 bomber. It was at an estimated distance of about 2 miles and at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The object was observed by an Air Force Radar Observer at Radar Station and by a Civilian and Air Force Observatory. 
3. Color of object: The color appeared to be in three appearances and red in another. In the latter instance, observers reported the possible object close to another, one red.
4. Attitude of object: Unknown. Sound, trail or exhaust not detectable.
5. Observers: Reliable. There are encircled as points from which the object was observed. 
6. The aircraft was in vicinity of observation area, but neither observer nor any other aircraft in the area.
7. The possibility is that the object might have been a light or lights sighted but they were too distant for conclusive observation or correlated with some known object in the area seen under unusual atmospheric conditions and very unusual aerial phenomena.
COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. This report of observation is viewed as of doubtful significance due to the casual nature of the observation and the failure either to properly identify the object or to obtain sufficiently detailed information about its appearance and performance to categorize it conclusively.
2. Recommend that this report be recorded and placed in Blue Book files.

Text found in the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

On the 12th at approximately 20:55 hours, a white light with a small rounded illumination was observed as a constant stationary elevation approximately 2 degrees above the horizon in the north due east (between Ventura and Santa Barbara).

The light was observed for a total of 6 minutes and was intermittent in nature, disappearing for periods of time and then reappearing.

At 21:15 hours, the white light was again observed for 15 seconds as it moved in an arc from northwest to southeast.

The object was seen again at 21:37 hours, for about 30 seconds. It was estimated to be at an elevation of about 10 or 15 degrees and was approximately 1/3 the size of a dime held at arm's length.

There is no indication of any object or any object was observed; the sighting was essentially of a light phenomena.

2. Captain ____ , Senior Radar Observer at Guard Air Force Base, made the following observation while scanning beside the Public Control Tower at the base on the evening of the 12th:
A yellow-white light was observed maneuvering silently at high speed, disappearing and reappearing, covering a considerable distance in a very short time.

1. The flight was reported to be traveling on a heading of 170°, perpendicular to the military base.

2. The speed of the flight was estimated to be at least 500 knots at an undetermined altitude but it disappeared abruptly.

COMMENTS or FINDINGS OFFICER:

The factual reports stressed pertinent to the unidentified object are well-documented characteristics of the flight. The object, since the first pass seemed to be maneuvering, gives the impression that it is entirely possible that this is an extremely high performance vehicle capable of high speeds, high altitude and abrupt disappearance, with the characteristics that tend to identify this as something apart from conventional aircraft.

The observations were made by a party of five (4) adults fishing off the beach and the Ventura public pier on the night of AUGUST 12, 1953.

[Redacted]

In addition to the above party, a party of 3 adults and 3 children were also sighting off the west end of the pier and made approximately similar observations. The identity or names of this group are NOT known.

[Redacted]

The light moved to the right at about 20 degrees elevation angle, with a duration fluctuated velocity. Its elevation angle was probably 20' to 30' above horizon. The light was white and of apparent magnitude of 1 to 2, slightly ahead of and somewhat to the right of the constellation Scorpio. The light was observed for about 20 seconds.

At 9:12 the light disappeared. It was about the same size as a star of the first magnitude and was a steady white light without any flashing or flickering effects. No sound was heard. It moved in a straight line and at a constant speed and disappeared suddenly and did not reappear.

The text in the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

The light was last seen at 9:17 pm when it appeared to the left and very rapidly moving away. The light was observed which may be attributable to a rocket flight. The light was observed in the sky for some time and the length of time the light was observed.

During all of the above, no sound whatever was heard that might have been associated with the light. The individuals who observed the light attempted to locate the source of the light but were unable to do so. The light was observed to be a bright light and their navigation lights were noted to be as bright as the main light. The angular velocity was observed to be so much slower than that of conventional jet aircraft.

No outline of any object was seen in connection with the light. The light appeared to be self-luminous. The individuals believe that the above is an accurate summary of their observation.

PAGES 1 OF 2 PAGES
1. The observer sighted an unusual object at approximately 2100 hours on 12 August 1953 while located on the seaside and at the Ventura Beach. The object was described as large, round, and illuminating. The observation was made between 5-10 minutes.
2. It approximately 2102 hours, Pacific daylight time, a white light was observed in the southwestern portion of the sky. The light was observed to perform unusual maneuvers, to stop momentarily, and then to resume moving at a high rate of speed. The light was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes.
3. The light moved to the south at a constant average elevation angle with an apparent absence of sound.
4. When the light moved to the north, it appeared to be illuminated and larger in size as if approaching the observer. At this point, it stopped and hovered momentarily. A red light was also observed in conjunction with the white light.
5. The red light was steady and comparable to the white light in brightness.
6. The white light was slowly flickering or pulsating. This characteristic seemed to increase and decrease in intensity, giving the appearance of a wavelike motion.
7. The total sighting time was observed to be in 30 seconds, the movement to the north and then disappearing into the haze.
8. At no point in the sighting was any object or form discernible, only the illuminating lights described above.
9. No sounds were associated with the sighting.
10. The weather at the time was clear, slight breeze from the north.
11. No further details were available.

AF FORM 112--PART 1
COUNTRY: United States
INCIDENT: 12 August 1953
LOCATION: Ventura, California
REPORTING AGENCY: 352 TD, 1st Lt, USAF
SUMMARY: 1. Object illustrated in flight and appeared luminous, moving at times slowly, then very rapidly and silently. Four civilian and Air Force observers watched object for approximately two hours on 12 August 1953.
2. Object illuminated in flight and appeared to have different times to four civilian and Air Force observers, California and Air Force Base, Oxnard, California.
3. Color of object was white in three dimensions and red in another. In the latter instance, the possible change in color was noticed.
4. Altitude of object was not determined. Sound, trail or exhaust not detected. Propulsion system not determined.
5. Observers considered reliable. There was no engine sound, and no vapor trail or exhaust was detected. Air Force Observers estimated that the altitude was below 10,000 feet, but it was not determined accurately.
6. No jet aircraft were in vicinity or observation area, but neither aircraft nor other objects were reported nearby.
7. Reliability that "these" objects have been lights of some kind is based on the observation that colors and shapes have changed in a manner characteristic of luminous objects in the sky, and there were no very definite sounds of place in the area. Observed for approximately two hours.
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATING OFFICERS: L.t. Girman's statement of Civilian Observer and Captain L-- statement of Military Observer.

a. The light was estimated to be traveling at a heading of 170°, particular to the runway which headed 205°. 
b. The light was estimated to be at least 500 knots at an estimated altitude and disappeared suddenly.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
The detailed report by highly competent observers indicates that the light was traveling at an estimated 500 knots at an estimated altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. This indicates that the light was probably something much faster than the conventional aircraft known at that time. The high speed and disappearance of the light is quite indicative of the unusual nature of the object.
