REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT SIGHTED
ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 12, 1953

UNCLASSIFIED                                                13 August 1953

The observations were made by a party of four (4) adults fishing off the seaward end of the Ventura public pier. The party consisted of:
[Names are blacked out]
Oxnard, Oxnard
[More names blacked out]
Bellingham, Washington

In addition to the above party, a party of 3 adults and 3 children were also sighting off the end of the pier and made approximately similar observations, however, the names of the members of this party are not known to the writers.

At approximately 9:05 pm a light was observed in the western sky. Then, at light was first sighted at approximately 10° above the horizon at a point about 5° north of due west. The light was approximately 1/2° to 3/4° in diameter. The light was white, not blinding, but sharp.

The light moved in the night sky about constant elevation angle. As it moved, it definitely changed color from white to green to red. The fluctuations appeared to be periodic without a definite pattern. The light appeared to be moving at a slow but steady pace. It was believed to be the coast lighted control. At this point the light was clearly visible, very distinctly noted at about 30° elevation, and light was steady and bright.

The path of the light continued to move to the left with increasing velocity. The disappearance was gradual in nature. Observers estimated that the 90° of azimuth was traversed in about 20 seconds.

At 9:15 pm the light reappeared at about the same azimuth angle as that at which it had been last seen, but at an elevation of 15 to 20°. Only the white light was now seen. The light moved to the NE and seemed to fade out. This disappearance was more rapid than the first.

The light was lost at 9:17 and went westerly. Gone and left and disappeared. This verification was made by two who saw it distinctly and a third who was slightly behind. The light was bright, intense white and the light was observed.

During all of the above, no sound whatever was heard that might be attributed to the light. The sun was quite with a very light one-color clouds. Then possibly commercial aircraft give over the area, and again through the searchlight the angular velocity was slower than the unidentified white light, the sound of their engine was clear and distinct. Also, their angular velocity was seen to be much slower than 1/2 or the 1/2.

In addition of any object was seen in connection with the light. The point was at the Ventura, California Air Force Station, where a light was in progress, the sufficient to enable observation of quite low altitude. Haze and the end of the sky.

The undersigned individuals believe that the above is an accurate summary of their observation.

SUMMARY: (First paragraph of report)

1. One unidentified object with magnitude and shape of the report seen by four civilians and one Air Force officer off Ventura, California coast for an occurrence total of 65 seconds total time 2150 to 2155 hours on 12 August 1953.

2. Object fluctuated in flight and appeared three different times to four qualitatively total observers located on seaward end of public pier in Ventura, California and once to an Air Force Radar Observer while standing on end of runway at Oxnard Air Force Base, California.

3. Color of object was white in three appearances and red in another. In the latter instance, observer noted two possible objects close together, one white, one red.

4. Altitude of object unknown. Sound, trail or exhaust not detected, propulsion system not determined.

5. Observers considered reliable. Three are engineers at Point Mugu Naval Air Missile Test Center and one a Civil Air Patrol Member. Air Force Officer is the Senior Radar Observer at Oxnard Air Force Base.

6. Jet aircraft were in vicinity of observation area, but neither aircraft members nor GCI sites reported anything unusual.

7. The possibility that object might have been lights of F-94C Starfire was advanced to the observers, but they discounted theory due to total absence of sound on an unusually quiet evening and also the very audible sound of planes in the area soon after the observation.

1. Three adults from Oxnard, California, while riding on the beach, observed on 12 August 1953 while located on the central end of the Ventura Public Pier:

a. At approximately 2105 hours, Pacific Daylight Time, a white light with the area possibly as the size of a dime was noted moving in an elevation of about 20° above the horizon, which was steady, not blurred, blinking or hazy.

b. The light moved to the north at a constant average elevation angle with small random fluctuations without definite periodicity.

c. When the light moved to this was judged to be the Constellation Castor, it stopped and moved to the north at the same 20° elevation. A red light was also observed very slightly above the white light.

d. The red light was steady and comparable to the white light in brightness. As the turning of 20° of azimuth to the south, the light disappeared suddenly, with an apparent horizon in velocity.

e. The 90° of azimuth was covered in 30 seconds; the movement to the north in 15 seconds.

f. At 2115 hours, the white light appeared for 15 seconds at about the same angle, moving in a westward direction of about 10° at 2125 hours. Continuing to the north, it headed towards, gradually disappearing into or above a fog bank several miles from shore.

g. The white light was again seen at 2117 hours for about six seconds and very easily traceable, anchoring southward then disappeared. This analysis to a meteor's flight.

h. No conclusive definitive explanation was quite able with a very bright celestial object with a very visible and comparable to the lights viewed. No proof of actual UFO was very audible and light's trajectory.

i. No outline or any object was observed though the area was partially illuminated by reflection of lights from a nearby baseball park in addition to those of the moonlight.

2. Captain [REDACTED], Senior Radar Observer at Central Air Force Base made the following observation while staring, beside via Public Service Company Towers on the east end of the runway 25:

a. A yellowish-white light of undetermined origin, undoubtedly a horizontal flight path, crossed slightly in front of a landing F-80 at 2122 hours, Pacific Daylight Time, and was observed for six to eight seconds.

b. The light was estimated to be traveling on a bearing of 170°, perpendicular to the runway which headed 230°.

c. The speed of the light was estimated to be at least 500 knots at an undetermined altitude and disappeared suddenly.

Contents of Preceding Sections:

The factual reports advanced pertinent to the unidentified object are well-documented cases by highly capable individuals. The fact that the lights were seen cannot be questioned but it is entirely probable that the lights might have been those of a possible A20C aircraft known to be in the vicinity at the time.

However, in absence of more positively identifying data, the theory along with the orbital might path of the object.

REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED
ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 12, 1953

UNCLASSIFIED                                                13 August 1953

The observations were made by a party of four (4) adults finding off
the seaward end of the Ventura public pier. The party consisted of:
[Several names are blacked out]

In addition to the above party, a survey of 3 adults and 3 children were
also finding off the end of the pier and made apparently similar ob-
servations; however, the names of the members of this party are not
known to the undersigned.

At approximately 9:05 p.m. a light was observed moving in the western sky.
When first observed, the light was a little to the right of a line
parallel to the part of the pier so which the party was located, and at
an elevation of about 30°. The light was white and of approximately the
same magnitude as the stars in its neighborhood. It was not blurred or
hazy but appeared as a point source. The light was steady, not blinking.

The light moved to the right at about constant average elevation angle.
As it moved, its elevation fluctuated rather rapidly by a small but per-
ceptible amount. The fluctuations averaged to be random in its definite
definition periodically. The light stopped moving when it reached a point
above a pair of stars believed to be the constellation Gemini. It then
remained stationary for about 10°. At about 20° in azimuth, a red light
was now observed, very slightly above of and above the white light. The
red light was steady and of roughly the same brightness as the white light.

The part of the light described to this point was with increasing velocity
and disappeared after traversing perhaps 90° of azimuth. The increase in
velocity just before disappearing was especially noticeable. It was after-
wards estimated that the 90° of azimuth was traversed in about 20 seconds.

At 9:15 p.m. the light reappeared at about the same azimuth angle as that
at which it had been last seen, but at an elevation of 15 to 20°. Only
the white light was seen. The light moved to the right and seemed to
move out to sea. It disappeared gradually rather into or toward a low bank
which appeared to be general in character. This disappearance was
different from the previous one which had been rather sudden. It was the
opinion of the group that the light had actually been obscured by the fog.

The light was last seen at 9:17 pm when it appeared off to the left and very rapidly moved down and left and disappeared. This certain appearance was the only one which had any similarity to a meteor flight. The light was moving from right to left on this appearance but no red light was observed.

During all of the above, no sound whatever was heard that might be attributed to the light. The sea was quiet with a very light onshore breeze. Subsequently, comments at various locations were made, even though their navigational lights were judged to be no brighter than the unidentified white light, the source of their origins was clear and distinct. Also, their angular velocity was slower than that of the light.

No outline of any object was seen in connection with the light. The moon was a thin crescent. The illumination from the Ventura baseball park, where a light just was in progress, was sufficient to enable observation of details several times. But there was no explanation of the light.

The undersigned individuals believe that the above is an adequate summary of their observations.

1. Three miles from Oxnard, California, [redacted] and one resident of [redacted], Washington, made the following observation on 12 August 1953 while located on the seaward end of the Ventura Public Pier:

a. At approximately 2105 hours, Pacific Daylight Time, a white light with some magnitude as the stars was seen moving north at an elevation of about 30°, 115° to the north of the pier where the observers were located. The light was steady, not blurred, blinking or hazy.

b. The light moved to the north at a constant average elevation angle with small random fluctuation without definite periodicity.

c. When the light moved to what was judged to be the Constellation Gemini, it stopped and moved to the north at the same 30° elevation. A red light was also observed very slightly ahead of and above the white light.

d. The red light was steady and comparable to the white light in brightness. After traversing 90° azimuth to the north, the lights disappeared suddenly with an apparent increase in velocity.

e. The 90° of azimuth was traversed in 30 seconds; the movement to the north in 15 seconds.

f. At 2115 hours, the white light reappeared for 15 seconds at about the same position as before, then disappeared. At about 15 or 20 degrees north of the north, it blinked once, gradually disappearing into a fog bank about a mile from shore.

g. The white light was again seen at 2117 hours for about six seconds. It appeared to the north and very rapidly traveled downward, making continued observation impossible.

h. No sound was audible throughout, except with a very slight sensation of vibration. Lights moved with a very light coverage over the area and though investigation lights were turned on the lights remained, the speed of engine and very audible and the airfield's angular velocity was also in comparison to the light's trajectory.

i. No outline of any object was observed though the area was partially illuminated by reflection of lights from a nearby baseball park in addition to those of the lights.

2. Certain [redacted] at Oxnard Air Force Base made the following observations while standing beside the mobile control tower in the west end of the runway 26:

a. A yellowish-white light of undetermined origin, maintaining a horizontal flight path, crossed slightly in front of a landing F-94C at 2126 hours, Pacific Daylight Time, and was observed for six to eight seconds.

SUMMARY:
1. One unidentified object with shape of white disc was reported by four civilians and one Air Force officer off Ventura, California coast for an accumulated total of 56 seconds within a time span from 2105 hours to 2126:08 hours on 12 August 1953.

2. Object fluctuated in flight and appeared three different times to four observers. Located on seaward and off public pier in Ventura, California and close to an Air Force Radar Observer while standing on end of runway at Channel Air Force Base, California.

3. Color of object was white in three appearances and red in another. In the latter instance, observers reported two possible objects close together, one red.

4. Altitude of object unknown. Sound, trail or exhaust not detected, propulsion system not determined.

5. Observers considered reliable. Three are engineers at Point Mugu Naval Air Missile Test Center and one a civil Air Patrol Member. Air Force Officer is the Senior Radar Observer at Channel Air Force Base.

6. No aircraft were in vicinity of observation area, but neither aircrews nor GCI sites reported anything unusual.

7. The possibility that object might have been lights of 2-940 Starfires was advanced to the observers, but they discounted this, due to total absence of sound on an unusually quiet evening and also the very audible sound of planes in the area.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Evaluation of information is C-3 due to above average intellect of observers and their highly factual report of the object allegedly observed.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

The factual reports advanced pertain to the unidentified object are well-documented accounts by highly capable individuals. The fact that the lights were seen cannot be questioned but it is entirely probable that the lights might have been those of a orbiting P-340 aircraft. However, the absence of sound partially discounts this theory along with the erratic flight path of the object.
