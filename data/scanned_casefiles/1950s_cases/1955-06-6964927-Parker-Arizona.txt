4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. DURATION: 15 min

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The (3) objects, yellow, white, red, were observed on ground radar for approximately 15 minutes. They were almost directly overhead, moving northeast and then east. The objects appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and were of unknown nature to the personnel observing them. No further information available, as this was pilot's first observation.
12. CONCLUSIONS: The objects may have been aircraft of some kind, but were not identified positively during the observation. Further investigation is needed to determine the nature of the objects.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object
REFERENCE: AF Form 112, ATCC-4-92, 10 June 1955

1. On 6 June 1955, at approximately 11:00 PM, a circular, brightly lighted object was observed in the sky northwest of Parker, Arizona. The object was described as being approximately 25-30 feet in diameter and emitting a bluish-white light that illuminated the surrounding desert area to a considerable degree. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes before it disappeared to the southwest.

2. The observer, Mr. Wallace A. Watts, stated that he was driving his automobile on Arizona State Highway 95 approximately 10 miles northwest of Parker when he noticed the object. He stopped his car and watched the object for several minutes before it disappeared. Mr. Watts described the object as descending to an estimated altitude of 500 feet above the desert floor before accelerating rapidly and disappearing to the southwest.

3. An investigation of this incident was conducted by personnel from the 4706th AISS at Luke AFB, Arizona. The investigation failed to reveal any conclusive evidence as to the nature or origin of the unidentified aerial object. No further information is available.

INCIDENT NO. 6964927
DATE: 6 JUNE 1955
LOCATION: PARKER, ARIZONA
INVESTIGATING OFFICER: CAPT. SISK

AT APPROXIMATELY 2000 HOURS ON 6 JUNE 1955, MR. JOHN DOE, A RESIDENT OF PARKER, ARIZONA, REPORTED SIGHTING A LUMINOUS OBJECT IN THE SKY APPROXIMATELY 25 MILES SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF PARKER, ARIZONA. MR. DOE STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND APPROXIMATELY 30-50 FEET IN DIAMETER. HE FURTHER STATED THAT THE OBJECT EMITTED A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT FROM ITS SURFACE AND HOVERED OVER THE DESERT AREA FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES BEFORE ACCELERATING RAPIDLY UPWARD AND DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW. 

MR. DOE REPORTED THAT HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WIFE, MRS. JANE DOE, WHO ALSO OBSERVED THE OBJECT. WHEN QUESTIONED, MRS. DOE CORROBORATED HER HUSBAND'S ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT.

A CURSORY EXAMINATION OF THE AREA WHERE THE OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE HOVERED REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF PHYSICAL DISTURBANCE OR LANDING MARKS. NO OTHER WITNESSES TO THIS INCIDENT WERE LOCATED.

THIS CASE IS CLASSIFIED AS UNRESOLVED DUE TO LACK OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OR CORROBORATING WITNESSES.

THE UNIO REPORTED POSITION, HOWEVER, AFTER FLYING ONLY THIRTY
TO FORTY MILES WEST OF THE UFOB POSITION, HIS SLANT GYRO HAD
PRECESSED TO 32 DEGREES. WHEN PASSING THE SMALL TOWN OF VIDAL, CALIF
WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE UFOB REPORTED LOCATION, THE PILOT SIGHTED
THAT HE THOUGHT TO BE AN EXTREMELY LARGE STAR. THE OBJECT APPEARED
HIGH TO HIM (PILOT'S ALTITUDE WAS 29,992 FT., BROKEN LAYER OF CL-
OUDS WERE AT 32,200 FT.). THIS WOULD SEEM TO FIX THE ALTITUDE OF THE
OBJECT BETWEEN 29,992 FT AND 32,200 FT.) PILOT ESTIMATED THE LENGTH
OF OBSERVANCE OF THE OBJECT AT THREE MINUTES. THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED
SUDDENLY. HE DID NOT NOTICE ANY UNUSUAL COLORING OTHER THAN THAT THAT
NORMALLY SEEN WHEN VIEWING A STAR. HE STATED THAT THERE WERE NO
OTHER STARS VISIBLE.
ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT APPEARED STATIONARY TO HIM AND HIS STUDENT
CADET, THE HEADING OF THE T-33 WAS WESTERLY AS WAS THE DIRECTION
OF FLIGHT OF THE UFOB AS REPORTED BY THE GCC POST. THIS COULD
ACCOUNT FOR A STATIONARY APPEARANCE TO THE PILOTS OF THE T-33.
SUMMARY: IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE GCC POST AND THE T-33 PILOTS
SIGHTED THE SAME CONSTELLATION MOMENTARILY. IN THE EVIDENT-
ALLY WEIRD LIGHTING EFFECT FROM THE SUN FILTERING THROUGH THE
UNUSUAL CLOUD FORMATION, THE CONSTELLATION MAY HAVE APPEARED QUITE
STAR-LIKE.

UNUSUAL. HOWEVER, THE EXTREME DISTURBANCE OF AIRCRAFT MAGNETIC AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION. TWO OTHER INCIDENTS SIMILAR TO THAT EXPERIENCED BY THE T-33 HAVE OCCURRED TWICE IN THE PAST CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS IN THE SAME LOCATION. EACH TIME, THIS RAPID FLUCTUATION HAS BEEN ABLE TO SERIOUSLY INTERRUPT HEADINGS OF THE AIRCRAFT AND POSSIBLE TRAGEDY HAS BEEN AVOIDED. THE T-33 (AF 51652-2) MENTIONED HEREIN CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE GREAT ERROR IN HIS INSTRUMENT READINGS THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE FLIGHT. CONTINUAL NEW READINGS WERE GIVEN THE PILOT FROM THIS RADAR STATION UNTIL THE DESTINATION, NORTON AFB SAN BERNARDINO, CALIF. WAS REACHED. THE PILOT OF THE T-33 STATED THAT HE HAD HAD NO OTHER NAVIGATIONAL DIFFICULTY PRIOR TO APPROACHING THE TOWN OF VIDAL, CALIF.

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS SOME ELECTRO-MAGNETIC OR MAGNETIC ATTRACTION IN THE VICINITY OF VIDAL, CALIF. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT IT IS NOT A NATURAL ATTRACTION, BUT A COINCIDENCE OF AN UNUSUAL SIGHTING (AS CONFIRMED BOTH GROUND AND AIRBORNE PERSONNEL) SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE PILOTS EXPERIENCING GROSSLY ERRATIC INSTRUMENT READINGS, IS TOO GREAT TO BE JUST A MERE COINCIDENCE.

DATE OF REPORT: 6 June 1955
DATE OF INFORMATION: 29 May 1955
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Flying Object
1. On 29 May 1955, at approximately 1015 hours, observation of an unidentified flying object was made at PARKER, ARIZONA.
2. At approximately 1015 hours, FIRST LIEUTENANT FRANK M. BAKER, while performing routine ground duties, observed a bright, white, circular object moving in a northwesterly direction at extremely high speed. The object was observed for approximately 15 seconds and disappeared from sight.
3. The object appeared to be circular in shape, the size of a basketball at arm's length, and was bright white in color. It was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, much faster than any known aircraft. Due to the high speed and brief observation time, no details were discernible. The object was seen against a clear blue sky.
4. No other witnesses were present at the time of the observation. The weather was clear with a few scattered clouds. No sounds were associated with the object.
