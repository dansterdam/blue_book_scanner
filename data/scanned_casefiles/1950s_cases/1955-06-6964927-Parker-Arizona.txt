I.       Source:     Blue Raspberry, Rt. 14, 1955
          Address:   Box 206, Route Service
                     Tacoma, Wash.

          Race:      Lineman
          Occupation:    Lt. (Flight Incident)
          Education:     Unknown
          Confidential:  Pilot

II.      Reliability:    Although source is not investigated to the
          best of our knowledge, the report appears to be sincere and
          the source appears to be stable.

III.     Source's Description or Significant Observation:    On the evening of 1-5-55 while flying at the
          west of PARKER, ARIZONA, about 20 miles west of the town, at an altitude of 20,000 ft., the
          sighting of a round, bright, silvery-white object was made. The object was first sighted at a
          distance of about 20 miles to the right of the aircraft, and appeared to be stationary. As the
          aircraft continued its flight, the object appeared to be losing altitude and moving in a
          southwesterly direction. The source stated that the object was definitely not a balloon, star,
          or any known type of aircraft. Some number of minutes later, the object disappeared suddenly
          as if it had been "turned off".

          Some number of minutes later, a similar object was again sighted, this time to the left of the
          aircraft. Compass and other navigational aids were used to verify the observation. The source
          proceeded to make a detailed log of the USOB location.

SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATIVE REPORT

An investigative visit was made to San Bernardino Valley College on 17 November 1954 and the following information was obtained:

On 8 June 1953 the project officer of the 4602nd AISS received a call from the base operations officer at George AFB stating that a UFO had been sighted in the vicinity of the base.

[Several lines are partially obscured or illegible]

It was possible that the ground observer could not distinguish between heavenly bodies and an unidentified flying object.

[The rest of the document contains partially obscured text with multiple black redaction marks, making full transcription difficult]

The document appears to be a supplemental investigative report about a UFO sighting, dated 17 November 1954, referencing an incident on 8 June 1953 near George AFB.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[Top of document appears to be a form with some fields, but text is too faint/blurry to read clearly]

On 1 June 1953, the planet Jupiter was in the location of the constellation Taurus, near the star Aldebaran. At approximately 2200 hours, the second brightest object in the sky was observed...

[Several paragraphs are partially obscured or blurry, with some words legible but many sections blacked out or illegible]

The document appears to be a report discussing astronomical observations, with some sections redacted or blacked out. The date of 1 June 1953 and references to Jupiter and the constellation Taurus are clear, but much of the detailed text is difficult to read with certainty.

The bottom of the document has some form fields or administrative information, but the text is too faint to transcribe accurately.

SUBJECT TO 14 PUBLIC LAW

Flight Log: 1626/1SS

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The electric pack 050620 on 15 at 16:20hrs was placed into a defensive posture due to a possible UFO sighting near the area.

2. The investigation and brief analysis of the object reveals the following:

[Several lines of text are partially illegible due to image quality]

The observed movement of the object could be estimated at 30,000 ft.

Any confirmation with ground radar sites became impossible due to poor weather conditions and existing communication cut-off. Watching could not be directed due to poor visibility. Other factors:
- Pilot experiencing extreme atmospheric variations
- Winds: Chaotic and unpredictable
- Norton AFB received no formal report that such a condition does exist.

In this report, it is deemed necessary to emphasize the complexity of the situation and recommend further investigation of events.

[Signature]
William M. Carnes
2nd Lt. USAF
Officer in Charge

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
Concur with the comments of the Preparing Officer that the sighting was probably caused by the pilot's delusion.

HOWEVER, HE STATED THAT THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL CLOUD FORMATION IN
AREA. HE CLAIMED THAT THE SUN COULD HAVE CAUSED HALLUCINATIONS WHILE
FILTERING THROUGH THE STRANGE LOOKING CLOUD FORMATION. TWA 21 WAS
OVER THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE UFOB REPORTED LOCATION WITHIN
MINUTES OF THE ORIGINAL SIGHTING BY GOC.
THE USAF T-33 516592, ENCOUNTERED EXTREME VARIATIONS IN HIS MAGNETIC
COMPASS AND HIS SLAVE GYRO. HIS SLAVE GYRO WAS PRECESSING AT A RATE
OF TWENTY DEGREES EVERY TWELVE MILES AT THE TIME OF PASSING THE UFOB
LOCATION. HIS ORIGINAL HEADING WAS 266 DEGREES WHEN APPROACHING


- page 7 -

PAGE THREE OF RJWPJB 2G

THE UFOB REPORTED POSITION. HOWEVER, AFTER FLYING ONLY THIRTY TO FORTY MILES WEST OF THE UFOB POSITION, HIS SLAVE GYRO HAD PRECEDED TO 32° DEGREES. WHEN PASSING THE SMALL TOWN OF VIDAL, CALIF WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE UFOB REPORTED LOCATION, THE PILOT SIGHTED WHAT HE THOUGHT TO BE AN EXTREMELY LARGE STAR. THE OBJECT APPEARED HIGH TO HIM. (PILOT'S ALTITUDE WAS 28,000 FT., BROKEN LAYER OF CLOUDS WERE AT 32,000 FT. THIS WOULD SEEM TO FIX THE ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT BETWEEN 20,000 FT. AND 30,000 FT.) PILOT ESTIMATED THE LENGTH OF OBSERVANCE OF THE OBJECT AT THREE MINUTES. THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED SUDDENLY. HE DID NOT NOTICE ANY UNUSUAL COLORING OTHER THAN THAT NORMALLY SEEN WHEN VIEWING A STAR. HE STATED THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER STARS VISIBLE.

ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT APPEARED STATIONARY TO THE AND HIS STUDENT CADET, THE HEADING OF THE T-33 WAS WESTERLY AS WAS THE DIRECTION OF FLIGHT OF THE UFOB AS REPORTED BY THE GOC POST. THIS COULD ACCOUNT FOR A STATIONARY APPEARANCE TO THE PILOTS OF THE T-33.

SUMMARY: IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE GOC POST AND THE T-33 PILOTS SIGHTED THE TWA 21 CONSTELLATION MOMENTARILY, IN THE EVIDENTIALLY WEIRD LIGHTING EFFECT FROM THE SUN FILTERING THROUGH THE UNUSUAL CLOUD FORMATION, THE CONSTELLATION MAY HAVE APPEARED QUITE

PAGE FOUR OF RJMPDS 26

UNUSUAL, HOWEVER, THE EXTREME DISTURBANCE OF AIRCRAFT MAGNETIC AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION. TWO OTHER INCIDENTS SIMILAR TO THAT EXPERIENCED BY THE T-33 HAVE OCCURRED TWICE IN THE PAST CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS IN THE SAME LOCATION. EACH TIME, THIS RADAR STATION HAS BEEN ABLE TO REMEDY THE INCORRECT HEADINGS OF THE AIRCRAFT AND POSSIBLE TRAGEDY HAS BEEN AVOIDED. THE T-33 (AF 516522) MENTIONED HEREIN CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE GREAT ERROR IN HIS INSTRUMENT READINGS THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE FLIGHT. CONTINUAL NEW HEADINGS WERE GIVEN THE PILOT FROM THIS RADAR STATION UNTIL THE DESTINATION, NORTON AFB SAN BERNARDINO, CALIF, WAS REACHED. THE PILOT OF THE T-33 STATED THAT HE HAD HAD NO OTHER NAVIGATIONAL DIFFICULTY PRIOR TO APPROACHING THE TOWN OF VIDAL, CALIF.

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS SOME ELECTRO-MAGNETIC OF MAGNETIC ATTRACTION IN THE VICINITY OF VIDAL, CALIF. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT IT IS NOT A NATURAL ATTRACTION. THE COINCIDENCE, OF AN UNUSUAL SIGHTING (AS CONFIRMED BOTH GROUND AND AIRBORNE PERSONNEL) SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE PILOTS EXPERIENCING GROSSLY ERRATIC INSTRUMENT READINGS, IS TOO GREAT TO BE JUST A MERE COINCIDENCE.
