(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may restate information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

The text of the handwritten description is as follows:

"The object which appeared appeared to be disc-shaped. The color was light pink or white and the size was estimated to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object moved in a horizontal flight, remaining level with a dark, shadowy trail or exhaust behind it. At times the object seemed to increase in speed while at other times it seemed to decrease speed. At no time did the object change direction or altitude. I watched the object for approximately 5 minutes as it moved across the sky and out of sight. I had a few companions with me at the time who also observed the object. They all described it as I have described it above."

The 15 minutes the object had disappeared from sight had elapsed approximately the object was at any position I could see and the observer advised me that the course appeared to be on a perfect horizontal course at an evend-slow speed when suddenly it appeared to accelerate rapidly and attain an extremely high speed and disappear to the east far out over the trees. 
When I say it appeared to be 6 inches in diameter and seemed to be at an estimated distance of 20 to 25 miles, but as I say, it may hare been only a matter of seconds or even less when the object attained a very high speed and disappeared aver the trees to the east.
It is quite difficult to state with certainty just what type of object this was, but the undersigned is convinced that from the appearance, hovering, and extreme acceleration it could not have been a conventional type aircraft.
There was a note around the room.
Prime reco 6 wkrnlsa: "He stated he was exceptionally good at estimating distances and even knew the Hopkins."

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather two sketches. 

The first sketch shows a curved line with the letter "A" marked on it. This sketch is intended to illustrate how high the observed object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a person standing on a road. It also includes a smaller inset sketch showing a more distant landscape with a curved sky.

OCR Text:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.
