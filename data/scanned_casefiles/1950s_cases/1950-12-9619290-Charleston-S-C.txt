Flying Saucer Reported Seen Over AEC Plant
CHARLESTON, S.C., Dec. 9 (AP) - A flying object which appeared to be 50 to 60 feet in diameter was seen over the Atomic Energy Commission's plant at Aiken, S.C., for about 10 minutes last night, authorities said. 
The Rev. R. D. Perkinson, a Baptist minister, said he saw the object shortly after 6:30 p.m. He described it as a bright light which seemed to be hovering over the plant. 
Perkinson said the object finally shot away at a high rate of speed. He said "People probably think we're crazy down here for seeing this, but it's true. It's just like a great big white star with beams and spokes coming from it. I saw it and so did others." 
A. H. Iradell McCarthy, of Aiken, S.C., and his 15-year-old daughter, Evelyn, also reportedly saw the object at the same time as Perkinson.
The article goes on to describe the sighting and reactions from witnesses. There is no photograph included in the document.
