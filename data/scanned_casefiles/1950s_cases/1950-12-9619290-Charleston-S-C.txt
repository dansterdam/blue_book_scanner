Flying Saucer
Reported Seen
Over AEC Plant

BLENTON, Dec. 9. - Were
flying saucer dying on the pre-
cinct site of the nation's first
hydrogen bomb plant last night
Four persons told today of see-
ing a strange, brilliantly-lighted ob-
ject in the sky about 10:45 p. m.
It dipped up and down and flashed
back and forth for about 10 min-
utes before it flew out of sight, one
eye-witness said.

This town is in the midst of the
vast tract which the Atomic Ener-
gy Commission has selected for
the site of the multi-million dollar
H-bomb plant which will be under
construction by early 1951.

The Rev. R. D. Parkinson, a Bap-
tist minister, said he was reluctant
to talk about flying saucers be-
cause everyone was already excit-
ed about having to abandon the
town to make room for the H-
bomb.

"People probably think we're
crazy down here anyhow," he said.
He said it seemed unlikely any-
one would try to make a secret
flight over the area in a craft as
well lighted as the object he saw,
but he felt he should report it any-
how.

The pastor said Golphin Dunbar,
a neighbor, first spotted the "saucer" and called his wife outside to look
at it. Iredell McCarthy, of Aiken a
dinner guest, and his 12-year-old
daughter, Evelon, came along.

According to Dunbar, "it looked
like a great, big white star with
neck and forth and up and down"
movement.

Parkinson said, the red lights
were no longer visible when he got
out in the yard. By that time, "it
looked like four stars together and
was moving away. It was moving
away toward Georgia in a south-
westerly direction.
