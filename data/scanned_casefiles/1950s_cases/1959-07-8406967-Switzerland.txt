REFLECTION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Photo analysis indicates that the most probable cause of the
light streak is a reflection.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 85-35

DATE OF REPORT 30 July 1965

SUBJECT: ANALYSIS OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA
LOCATION: PHOENIX, ARIZONA USA - SWITZERLAND
DATE AUGUST 1958 - JULY 1959

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF____ IR____ QUALITY____

Attached 2-35mm Color Slides and copies thereof

1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 65-ul from 7/Stg TDEAT/FUO, for an analysis of the attached two color slides and two black and white photo reproductions thereof.

2. ANALYSIS: The color slide of Highway 69, vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona is a copy probably from a picture in a magazine. It bears a registration symbol in the upper right hand corner of a type used by professional photographers. The slide depicts the phenomena of a desert sunset and containing little more than colorful and picturesque cloud formations. At the approximate midpoint of the slide is an orange, funnel-like mass which is probably a wind patten trailing a plume of sand/earth which has been lifted from the desert floor. A single, diagonal line immediately below this mass is probably due to poor photo processing.

The second slide, taken in Switzerland, is also a copy, although in this case the original source cannot be identified. The photograph is a low oblique possibly aerial in format and shows a view of the typical mountainous terrain of Switzerland. The definition and color rendition of the slide are not entirely fair, with the upper portion of the photograph is an oblong-appearing translucent streak which is probably due to reflection. From possibly a portion of the aircraft's surface from which the photography was taken.

b. No items of significance were observed on either slide.

The image contains what appears to be a grainy photograph of a long, cigar-shaped object with markings on it, that resembles a typical depiction of a "flying saucer" or unidentified flying object (UFO). The object is shown in what seems to be a cloudy sky.

NO CASE INFORMATION
SOURCE: FLYING SAUCER REVIEW 
Jul-Aug., Volume 10, No. 4 
2 Jul 59
Vienna

This photograph, the original of which is in colour, was submitted to us by Miss Dora Bauer. It was taken by Franz Hlawa of Vienna towards the end of July 1959. The location was Monte Rosa in Switzerland and the picture was taken at a height of 3,400 metres. Nobody in the party saw the object; it appeared only on the film.

SUDDENLY, ahead and about thirty degrees to the left, there were bright flashes in several places, like the dazzle of a helio- airoship graph, I saw a dull grey-white oblong coming towards me. It seemed impossible, but I could have sworn that it was a airoship, nosing towards me like an an, anti aircraft. Except for a cloud or two, there was nothing else in the sky.  I looked around, sometimes catching a flash or a glint, and pain again to look at the airship I found that it had disappeared. I screwed up my eyes, unable to believe them, and twisted the seaplane this way and that, thinking that the airship must be hidden by a blind spot.  Dazzling flashes continued in four or five different places, but I still could not pick out any planes.  Then, out of some clouds to my right front, I saw another, or the same, airship advancing. I watched it intently, determined not to look away for a fraction of a second: I’d see what happened to this one, if I had to chase it.  It drew steadily closer, until perhaps a mile away, when suddenly it vanished.  Then it reappeared, close to where it had vanished: I watched with angry intentness.  It drew closer, and I could see the dull gleam of light on its nose and back.  It came on, but instead of increasing in size, it diminished as it approached.  When quite near it suddenly became its own ghost—once second I could see through it, and the next it had vanished.  I decided that it could only be a diminutive cloud, perfectly shaped like an airship and then dissolving, but it was uncanny that it should exactly resume the same shape after it had once vanished.  I turned towards the flashes, but those too, had vanished.  All this was many years before anyone spoke of flying saucers.  Whatever it was I saw, it seems to have been very much like what people have since claimed to be flying saucers."

From The Lonely Sea and the Sky, by Francis Chichester.  (Year of sighting, 1931)
