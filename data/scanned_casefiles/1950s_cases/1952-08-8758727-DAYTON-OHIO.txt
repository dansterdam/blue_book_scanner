Memorandum for Record                                                   25 August 1952

Subject: Report of Unidentified Aerial Object

1. At approximately 1300 on 25 Aug 52, a Mr. [redacted] of Vandalia
called and said that on the night of 24 Aug 52 he was in the Sherwood Drive-In
at Dayton. He noticed two objects which were about 15 times the size of a
star floating thru the sky at a rather high rate of speed. They seemed to
have a "weird glow," similar to a light-bulb placed behind a thin cloud. He
said that he was facing south and that the objects came in first into
appearance about 45° to his right (southwest). They came across the sky at
an elevation of about 45° and when they got into the southeast they just
disappeared as if someone had turned the light out. The incident took place
between 10 and 11 P.M. Eastern Standard Time.

2. Mr. [redacted] stated that although he was extremely dubious of any
publicity on "flying saucers" these things did have the appearance of a sau-
cer. He was very apologetic about calling and stated that he had been a
person who had scoffed the most at these "flying saucer" reports and that he
did not say that the objects he saw were "flying saucers". He stated, however,
that they definitely gave the appearance of being disc-shaped and he did not
believe that they were aircraft.

Subject: Report of Unidentified Aerial Objects

1. At approximately noon on 25 Aug 52, an airman from the 97th Fighter-
Interceptor Squadron called and reported that on the night of 24 and 25 Aug 52
from 2400 until 0100 he observed an object due East of his home which is at
the corner of [redacted] in Dayton. The object appeared to
be at a 45° elevation, 3 to 4 times bigger than a star, with about the same
color as a star. It was gone at 0300 when he got up to go to work.

Report of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

Date: 31 Aug. 1952
Time: 2345 hrs.

Details:

Capt. Atkinson, OD NO. 1, Bldg. 10, received a call from the Piqua Police Dept. (Patrolman Etter) at 2330. Patrolman Etter informed Capt. Atkinson that one Patrolman Etter (North Piqua) observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon in that locality; namely "oblong, with flashing red and blue lights, definitely unlike an aircraft." Patrolman Etter stated that as soon as a squad car became available, he would check with Mr. [redacted] on this story. Ptl. Etter feels that the source is reliable. Mr. [redacted] phone No. is PIQUA

I advised Capt. Atkinson that we would like to speak with these people as soon as the return call is made. Since action is being taken, do not feel that there is any need for an immediate call.

Capt USAF

Note: Called Capt. Atkinson 0715 hrs., 1 Sept., since I did not receive any further call from Piqua. Neither did he.

Report of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

Date: 1 Sept. 1952
Time: 0001

Details:
Miss [redacted], of [redacted] Ave., called to report peculiar sky activity, from 2300 hrs. to time of the call.

Place of observation: South of Dayton Municipal Golf Course.

Object: Apparently an unusually bright star with the brilliance of an aircraft landing light (no beam), however, it moved what appeared to be 'auxiliary' stars; sometimes at 2 o'clock position, sometimes at 11 o'clock. Occasional movement was apparent. First observed at 30° above the horizon.(2300). Now (0001) at 50° above the horizon. This was a naked eye observation.

Source: Ex-camp director, somewhat familiar with basic astronomy. Previously reported a similar experience to the Lebanon, Ohio Sky Watch.

REPORT OF "UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA"

At 20:25 a woman called to report the sighting of "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena" Advised her that she did not have to identify herself, it would help us if she would do so. She then gave her name as "Mrs. [redacted]", address [redacted], Dayton.

She stated that at approximately 19:00 she heard her son, who was playing in the yard, call telling her to come look at something in the air. She went out in the yard, her father-in-law also going out. At first she saw nothing, but then in the southeast she noted two "disc shaped" objects. Objects were oval in shape, moving slowly, on a rising path. After a brief period of time they disappeared. Attached form will provide a few of the standard answers.

As something over an hour had passed since observing objects, due to trying to decide whether to report them, then trying to find out how to report them she was not as sure of various identifying data as was necessary. Her information was inexact, she had great difficulty trying to describe the objects as to size height, color, speed, etc.

It was still daylight at the time of sighting, yet they saw the objects reasonably clearly. She therefore assumed it had some light or glow in connection with it. Asked if any familiar fixed objects were within her field of vision at the time which she could compare objects she said no. There were no clouds in the immediate vicinity of the objects, tho some appeared shortly thereafter.

Feeling that further questioning on my part gave promise of little return, I terminated conversation. Then checked the phone book to see if anyone by given name was listed at given address. There was [redacted] listed in the phone book. I called the number listed and verified the fact that the woman at this residence had in fact been the person who called.
