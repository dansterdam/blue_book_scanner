SUMMARY: (Use reverse side for comments on this document)

The Security Officer, 181st AGS Group, MATS, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, has forwarded the following report of the sighting of unidentified aerial objects.
The report was extracted from the 14 November 1950 edition of the Atlanta Constitution.

"Flying Saucers. The first flying saucers' to be sighted in Rome, Georgia, came Monday, 14 November 1950, when reports to the Rome News-Tribune revealed that five persons saw two of the strange discs at about 2:30 P.M. All five, including the Russell Airport Manager and a U.S. Weather Observer, stated that they plainly saw the discs. They said they spotted the strange objects about 2:30 P.M. at the same time that an Air Force AT-6 training plane buzzed the Russell Field runway. The discs were in sight for several minutes before they disappeared, one to the north and one to the northeast. One dropped toward the field and then climbed away, the group said. Their altitude and size was impossible to estimate, they said. Eastern Air Lines planes were alerted to watch for the saucers."
