'Big 3' Missiles
Do Well In Tests
Atlas, Thor, Jupiter Demonstrate
U.S., Soviets Equal In ICBM Field

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Nov. 5 (JP)—The big three of U.S. missiles—Atlas, Thor and Jupiter—effectively demonstrated this nation's rocket retaliatory power in the past two days.

All three were launched on long-range test flights during a 20-hour period. Officials reported all successfully dropped simulated warheads on designated ocean targets.

The intermediate range Thor blasted off Tuesday night on a 1,500-mile journey. The Atlas took off on an intercontinental range flight of 4,800 miles yesterday, and the Jupiter IRBM sped 1,500 miles down the Atlantic missile range last night.

SUCCESSFUL flights are nothing new to this fiery trio of military blockbusters. They have covered the course many times during lengthy research and development programs here.

The United States has declared all three operational, and their current test programs are designed to improve their accuracy and reliability.

Combat-ready Atlases and Thors are poised on launching pads abroad. Jupiters soon will join them to provide America with one of its greatest war deterrents.

New-Type Snark
Gets Test Run

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., (JP)—An Air Force Snark intercontinental missile was launched yesterday in a test to prove new equipment designed to cut the missile's reaction time.

The Snark, now being tested, may also be used in its programmed flight to demonstrate the Atlantic missile range to the neighborhood of 5,000 miles.

Officials said the new equipment will build an electronic multi-path in the Snark's already fast countdown. It will be included in operational Snarks produced by the Northrop division of Northrop Corp.

The Snark missile was launched by a Nora Air Force missile for the ARPA Research and Development Command. Operational models Snarks are in service with the 702nd Aircraft Missile Squadron wing at Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine.

A FEW Atlases are stationed at Vandenberg Air Force base, Calif. Several more Atlas bases are being constructed through the Western United States. The missile has a range of 6,300 miles.

Four squadrons of Thors are assigned to NATO troops in England. Three Army Jupiter squadrons are scheduled for early deployment to NATO forces. Two will go to Italy, one to Turkey. Each squadron has 15 of the deadly weapons.

Although many U.S. officials concede this nation trails Russia in developing powerful space rockets, they believe the two countries are even in the ballistic missile fields.

Two other American ballistic missiles—the Titan ICBM and Polaris submarine weapon—pose test difficulties. Both, however, are expected to be added to the operational defense arsenal next year.

LITTLE JOE ROCKET
With Escape Capsule

Testing will begin in 1960 on two solid-fuel ballistic rockets, the 100-mile Pershing and the 5,000-mile Minuteman.
