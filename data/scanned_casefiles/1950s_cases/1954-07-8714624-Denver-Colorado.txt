LTG, DO 314 CST, Mr WGT, Hq USAF, WASH.D.C. Subject: "Unidentified Flying Objects"

Cloudily which at the time was estimated to be at 30,000 feet. The objects were visible for approximately a half second period, and appeared to be traveling at an estimated rate of speed of 1500 miles per hour, were definitely not slow moving.

4. At 1430 hours Capt. [redacted] and Capt. [redacted] interviewed by Special Agent USAF at Air Traffic Control Center, Stapleton Field, Denver, Colorado, advised they had been watching a B-36 type aircraft making passes over the Denver area at that time. July 2nd to 3rd, 1954, 50,000 feet. They had seen clouds and in attempting to predict the B-36 observed 4 or 5 similar objects appear. They will advise that the objects appeared to be triangular in shape and that they appeared to be capable of hovering in one spot for some period of time and then moving off at a normal rate of speed in a northwesterly direction. The only thing unusual they observed was that they were able to see their ability to hover in one place for extended periods of time.

5. According to Captain [redacted] the objects were observed by himself and 1st Lt. [redacted] and Captain [redacted] and the civilians who have been Flight Dispatchers for United Air Lines for some period of time.

6. Information has reached this office to the effect that Operation Skywatch having some maneuvers in this vicinity and that various air bases in this vicinity have either no knowledge or very limited knowledge of aircraft participating in the operation. At approximately 2000 hours on 2 July 1954 a local radio station announced that a B-36 type Operation SKYWATCH was being held in this vicinity and that a B-36 type aircraft was recalling the attack as exceptionally high altitude.
