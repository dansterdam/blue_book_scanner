The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a stargazing or astronomy guide. The photograph shows a starfield map and a set of symbols for identifying stars, planets, and other celestial objects. The title of the document is "Venus Most Prominent", indicating that the focus of the guide is on the planet Venus and its prominence in the evening sky.

Text from the document:

VENUS MOST PROMINENT

Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the west and will soon be joined by Leonids, "shooting stars".

BY JAMES STOKLEY

Though seemingly a brilliantly lighted object, Venus is in reality a rather dull and inconspicuous world. It appears so bright because it is close to the earth and reflects a great deal of sunlight. 

At present Venus is making its greatest appearance as an evening star for this year. It will reach its highest point in the sky about an hour after sunset, and will be setting before 8:30 p.m. This will continue for a few weeks.

Venus is now so conspicuous in the sky as to make it the most prominent object except the moon. It is about half as bright as the full moon, and appears as a beautiful brilliant star low in the west.

The planet's brightness is due to the fact that it is now between the earth and the sun, and its illuminated half is turned earthward. As it goes around the sun, Venus passes through phases like those of the moon, and at present we are seeing its "full" phase.

It will be some months before Venus becomes an evening star again, as it will pass between the earth and sun in the coming months. Then it will be seen as a morning star, rising shortly before the sun.

OCR text output:
It's Only Star, Folks! 'Thing' Is Identified From Plane Window
By AP - Weatherly, Pa., July 7 (AP) - Passengers on a commercial airliner saw "something" in the sky last night, but North Central Airlines Co-pilot Capt. William Zabel identified it as merely the Morning Star. 
The passengers were aboard an NC 12 flight from Minneapolis to Pittsburgh when they spotted the "thing" through the plane's windows. Zabel, who has been flying for 12 years, said the object was only the planet Venus.
"We were cruising at an altitude of about 23,000 feet when one of the passengers spotted it and asked me what it was," Zabel said. "I told him it was just the Morning Star, or the planet Venus, and he seemed satisfied.
"We had a good view of it and it was definitely not a flying saucer or anything unusual. It was just the bright planet."
Some of the passengers, however, said they saw the "thing" maneuvering and that it appeared to be larger than a star. But Zabel said the object was stationary and remained in the same position throughout the 30-minute flight.
"I've been flying 12 years and I know what the morning star looks like," he said. "That's all it was."
