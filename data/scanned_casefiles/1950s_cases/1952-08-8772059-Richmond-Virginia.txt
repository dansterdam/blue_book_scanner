AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: UNITED STATES

REPORT NO.: 127-3-52

LOCATION: Richmond, Virginia

DATE OF INFORMATION: 27 August 1952

FROM: 777th ACWN Sq., Fort John Custis, Va.

EVALUATION: B-2

SUBJECT: Personnel of the Richmond Filter Center

One (1) round, medium sized, amber colored object was sighted moving west northwest over Fort Eustis, Virginia at 0505, 27 August 1952 by Air Force personnel stationed at the Richmond Filter Center. Observers said the object located 100 miles west of Richmond, about 100 air miles per hour, and disappeared near the horizon. The object remained in sight for approximately five (5) minutes.

The object was again sighted at 0505 and was reported to this station at 0502. This station scrambled two (2) F-94 Interceptor aircraft to attempt an intercept. At 0706 one of the F-94s reportedly sighted a bright yellow light several miles south of Richmond. Contact was lost after three (3) minutes. The observers were in direct communication with this station and upon relaying position reports to the fighters, they stated that the only object visible to them was the planet Venus.

AF FORM 112-PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency) 117th ASAM Sq., Fort John
Curtis, Virginia

1. One (1) round medium sized, amber colored object was sighted moving at about 100 miles per hour. Object was normally seen moving and appeared near the horizon. Observers stated "it looked like a round light."

2. The object was sighted at 0503½, 27 August 1952 and remained under observation for five (5) minutes. The object was again sighted at 0502 and remained under observation for an indefinite time. It was reported as being very large and resembling a bright white light moving up and down.

3. The object was observed visually from the ground.

4. The object was observed over Richmond, Virginia. 37° 33' north latitude, 77° 25' west longitude.

5. The object was observed by Lt. and Mrs. Wolgemuth, Lt. Fox, Lt. Babcock, s/Sgt. Coverts, s/Sgt. Gray and s/Sgt. Hahn. All of these, with the exception of Lt. Wolgemuth, are area personnel and are stationed at the Richmond, Virginia Filter Center of the Ground Observer Corps.

6. Ceiling and visibility were unlimited. Wind aloft unknown.

7. Pilots of the two interceptors stated the only objects visible to them over Richmond was the planet Venus and they believed that it was the object being observed.

8. There is no physical evidence of the sightings.

9. The object was reported to this station the second time at 0502½. At 0529½, this station scrambled two (2) B-49 fighter-interceptor aircraft in an attempt to intercept the object. At 0705½ the pilot of one of the scrambled fighters reported a contest on a bright yellow light several miles south of Richmond. Contact was lost after three (3) minutes. The observers were in direct communication with this station and were relating the position of the object in relation to the fighters. The pilot of the lead aircraft stated that the planet Venus was the controlling factor. At 0715½, after searching the area for fifteen (15) minutes, the fighters were returned to their home base.

10. The pilots of the fighter aircraft reported no other aircraft in the vicinity.

11. At 0704½, Lt. Wolgemuth of the Richmond Filter Center called this station and said "I believe Lt. Babcock sighted the first object, looked away for a few minutes, and then mistook Venus for the object"

12. Signed narrative statements of observers have been forwarded.
