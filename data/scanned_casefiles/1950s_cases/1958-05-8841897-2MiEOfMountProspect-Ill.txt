The image appears to be a letter from Maribelle Cormack, the Director of the Roger Williams Planetarium, addressed to Dr. Walter Uphoff of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The letter mentions that the writer had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Uphoff speak at the planetarium and had used his book on flying saucers for a planetarium show.

The letter also describes an encounter that a Rhode Island woman had with an unidentified flying object (UFO) on May 20, 1958. According to the letter, the woman saw several things, including a "saucer" that was about 8 feet above ground and had two ordinary house rooms, metallic gray in color, connected by a large metallic band. The woman is described as a rational and sensible person, married with a son in some research work.

Dr.
Walter Uphoff
Cambridge, Massachusetts
Dear Dr. Uphoff:
We've had the pleasure of hearing you several times
at skyacrapers and we have used your book on Flying Saucers
at our Planetarium shows.
About a week ago, I made the acquaintance of a Rhode
Island woman who has actually seen a U.F.O. She may write
to you regarding this sighting. She made this sighting on
May 20, 1958 while driving from her home in a suburb of
Chicago to her home in a suburb of Chicago. The hour was
8:00 P.M. It was approximately clear. The matter
was reported on May 12, 1958.
She saw several things, among them, the "saucer" which
she said was perhaps 8 feet above ground and was two
ordinary house rooms, a flat gun metal gray in color,
connected by a large metallic band. She is a sober,
rational and sensible woman, 45 ish, married, with a son
in some research work, I thought perhaps you would wish
to add this to your voluminous file on U.F.O.
Sincerely yours,
Maribelle Cormack

July 30, 1959

Miss Maribelle Cormack
Museum Director
Roger Williams Park Museum
Providence 3, R.I.

Dear Miss Cormack:

In Dr. Menzel's absence from the Observatory, on an extended European trip, I wish to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of July 24. When he returns, on approximately September 11, I know he will be interested to read your informative note and its enclosure.

Sincerely yours,

Doris Beausoleil
Secretary to Dr. Menzel

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a letter addressed to "Mrs. Godfrey" from Donald H. Menzel, the Director of Project Blue Book, regarding a reported sighting of a "flying saucer" the previous May. The letter discusses the witness's observations and Menzel's assessment that the saucer was likely an "inferior mirage" of the sky, consistent with similar reports. The letter thanks the witness for sharing the information and indicates Menzel's continued interest in such sightings.

September 21, 1959

Mrs. -----
Arlington Heights, Illinois

Dear Mrs. Godfrey:

I have recently learned that you observed a "flying saucer" last May and reported this to the Air Force a few days later. Perhaps you are familiar with the story as published in the University Press. In any event, I am always interested in sightings, and try, if possible, to find a reasonable explanation for them. In most cases I have succeeded. I would appreciate it if you would send me just as much information as you possibly can - times, directions, locations, sky, and so on.

From the character of your report, as repeated to me, I would judge that this might be an "inferior mirage" of the sky, seen against a roadway. If the saucer was of a silvery gray and seemed to move ahead of your car as driving, keeping the road, this is almost certainly the proper explanation. Many people have made similar reports.

Thanking you in advance, I am

Cordially yours,

Donald H. Menzel
Director

Providence, R. I.

Dear Miss Cormack:

Thank you very much for your kind letter of July 24, about the report on Flying Saucers. I have just returned and wanted to reply and also to return to you the original pictures.

The report as given is far too lengthy for my attempted identification. Nevertheless, I think it might be wise if you could give me what the witness has to say.

Thank you for your interest. I am glad to add this to my file which, as you have access, is voluminous. 

Sincerely yours,

Donald H. Menzel
Director
