Driving into the sun CAN
CAUSE A PERSON TO SEE
THINGS THEY WOULDN'T ORDINARILY SEE.

This is not a good possibility
Because the satellite or rocket
COULD NOT BE SEEN DURING THE
DAY.

The elderly observer was striving into
the sun which no doubt caused her to
see something that wasn't there. This is
caused by the sun's refraction causing
an optical illusion

July 24, 1959

Dr. [redacted]
Harvard University
Cambridge, Massachusetts

Dear Dr. [redacted]:

I've had the pleasure of hearing you several times at Skyscrapers and we have used your book on Flying Saucers at our Planetarium shows.

About a week ago, I made the acquaintance of a Rhode Island woman who has actually seen a U.F.O. She may write to you. Her name is Mrs. [redacted], Arlington Hts., Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. She made this sighting on May 20, 1958 while driving from her Chicago office to her home in a suburb northwest of the city. The hour was 8:00 p.m., sky abnormally clear. The matter was reported to the Air Force on May 23, 1958.

She saw several things, among them, the "saucer" which she said was perhaps 8 ft. above ground and as big as two ordinary house rooms. It was a dull gun metal gray, its surface badly pitted, it looked like two old fashioned soup dishes. Fastened together by a large metallic band. She is convinced it was not a weather balloon.

She seems an entirely rational and sensible woman, 45 ish, married, with a son in some research dept. connected with missiles. I thought perhaps you would wish to add this to your voluminous file on U.F.O.s

Sincerely yours,

Dear Miss Cormack:

In Dr. Menzel's absence from the Observatory, on an extended European trip, I wish to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of July 24. When he returns, on approximately September 11, I know he will be interested to read your informative note and its enclosure.

Sincerely yours,

Mrs. [redacted]
Arlington Heights, Illinois

Dear Mrs. Godfrey:

I have recently learned that you observed a "flying saucer" last May and reported this to the Air Force a few days later. Perhaps you are familiar with my book on the subject of flying saucers, published by the Harvard University Press. In any event, I am always interested in sightings, and try, if possible, to find a reasonable natural explanation for them. In most cases I have succeeded. I would appreciate it if you would send me just as much information as you possibly can. Times, directions, locations, sky, and so on.

From the character of your report, as repeated to me, I would judge that this might be an "inferior mirage" of the sky, seen against a roadway. If the saucer was of a silvery gray and seemed to move ahead of your car as driving, keeping the road, this is almost certainly the proper explanation. Many people have made similar reports.

Thanking you in advance, I am

Cordially yours,

DHM/mg

Dear Miss Cormack:

Thank you very much for your kind letter of July 24, about the report on Flying Saucers. I have just returned and hasten to reply and also to return to you the original picture.

The report as given is far too fragmentary to make any attempt at identification. Nevertheless, I think I shall write the lady and see what she has to say.

Thank you for your interest. I am glad to add this to my file which, as you have guessed, is voluminous.

Sincerely yours,
