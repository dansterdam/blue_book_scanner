j. Location of any air traffic in the area at time of sighting.
(1) One B-47 and one B-25 NE of Amarillo. Ten other aircraft were in the area, types unknown.

k. The following account is submitted by the Commander, 668th ACWN Squadron. Two hours and seventeen minutes after the initial sighting by Sgt. _______ Aircraft between Balhart and Amarillo. (1st. Adams is an AC&W director assigned to the 7035d ACWN squadron). Lt. Adams was advised of the UFOB. Lt. Adams immediately reported that he had sighted a weather balloon, while he was over Dalhart. His aircraft was at 9,500 feet on an approximate heading of 145°. He estimated the altitude of the balloon as 15,000 feet at 15 knots. Lt. Adams flight route was just east of a projected balloon. A line drawn at an azimuth of 300° from Amarillo passed just west of Amarillo. A line drawn at an azimuth of 300° from Amarillo bisected the line representing Lt. Adams line of flight at a point 30 miles from Amarillo at 300°. Lt. Adams sighting was made approximately 12 minutes after the final sighting by the sergeant. Lt. Adams definitely identified a weather balloon with a bright light attached. A tape recording of all transmitted and the recorded log provided all of the above information. It is the opinion of the reporting officer that the UFOB and the weather balloon are the same. This is based on Lt. Adams report and his experience as a pilot and AC&W director and his familiarity with CONAC Manual 55-1 as well as the correlation of the tracks.
