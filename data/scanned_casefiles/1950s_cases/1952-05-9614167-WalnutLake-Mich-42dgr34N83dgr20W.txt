AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. At approximately 0800, 26 May 1952. the Wing Intelligence Office received a report that an officer had observed unidentified aerial objects flying over Randolph Air Force Base on the night of 25 May 1952.

2. Immediate investigation revealed the individual to be Captain John S. Jones, who was interrogated as soon as he could be located.

3. The interrogation revealed the objects to be tear-drop in shape, appearing to be about 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch, across. The actual size was undetermined, but when questioned as to their relative size in relation to known aircraft, he stated, they appeared larger than a B-29 at an altitude of 10,000 feet. They were also of a solid white mass of light with an orange tinge. He could distinctly count twelve objects, flying in three groups, four objects in each group in a very tight V-shape formation.

4. Captain Jones was unable to distinguish any aerodynamic features. He saw no trail or exhaust and the propulsion system could not be determined. Their speed was estimated to be between 1500 and 2000 miles per hour. He saw that it was definite that he had witnessed. Their sound of passing, was a faint soft, intermittent hum.

5. All the time the observation they were in straight and level flight, emitting sharp, changing lights they were out of sight. The outline of these tear-drop shaped lights could be definitely identified and such because they were enveloped against a very dark sky (demon was red and dots will let at the time). Their speed across the sky could be compared to that of a falling star.

6. The sighting was made at exactly 2127 Central Standard time on 25 May 1952. The objects were observed for approximately 3 seconds. The officer adjusted the time by the amount of time it took him to rapidly rise a suitable position in a chair and walk about 15 feet.

7. The observation was made from base by Captain Jones and two other witnesses who were at Randolph Air Force Base, coordinates 29 32 north 98 17 East. Captain Jones and the other witnesses were sitting there watching the objects appearing facing South, looking to the stars when suddenly object appeared in the West heading in an Easterly direction. They passed about 150° from North to East, they appeared to be about 700 and 1,000 feet above from the observers when overhead at an altitude above 10,000 feet.

3. The reporting officer has been an observer for 11 years and has been around aircraft all during that time. He is a rated Navigator currently on flying status with 2200 hours total flying time. He is present duty is Senior Oracle to the Chief of a navigation section of the Combat Crew Training School (Medium Bomber) at that station. The other two witnesses in these cases with this report in every detail, are: the officer's name, known as James, and Lt. Paul Hurdle, B-29 Pilot with the U.S. Air Force.

This account is corroborated as factual Meteorological data by the base weather station on location 290 that local forecasts were given that there were no weather events 15 nor any advisories that could account for the sighting.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT.
3510th CC Tng Wg, RAFB, Texas REPORT NO. TR-52
27 MAY 1952

C E R T I F I C A T E

I, Captain John S. Jones Jr. AO 414555, do certify that:

Sunday evening, 25 May 1952, I was sitting in the patio of my home on Randolph Air Force Base. There were two other people present, the three of us were discussing stars. At approximately 2130 local standard time, a group of lights, orange white in color, were seen to the west at an angular height of about fifteen (15) degrees above the horizon. These lights approached the east at an extremely rapid rate of speed. From the position I occupied, and as evidently I was able to see that they were of a teardrop shape, pointing toward the front or direction of travel, and twelve (12) in number. They were in three (3) groups of four (4); the three (3) groups formed a V. The sky was dark; no moonlight. Slow, and the lights were clearly visible. I judged the altitude of these lights to be about ten thousand (10,000) feet. Each light appeared to be an individual object. The only distinguishable sound was deep, soft, indistinct noise, similar to vroom. The size of the objects was not plain due to darkness, yet the apparent size of the lights was about one-eighth (1/8) of an inch in diameter. These twelve (12) objects crossed their formation across the sky and passed from view toward the south. The entire time taken by these objects to appear in the west, pass overhead, and disappear to the east was about three (3) seconds. The time it actually took them to pass, and really get up from seat and move less than fifteen (15) feet. Speed of objects is estimated to be in excess of two thousand miles an hour.

[Signature] John S. Jones Jr.

The image seems to be a map, not a photograph. It depicts several towns, roads, and geographical features with labels and annotations. The map has annotations indicating a “LINE_OF_FLIGHT” and “FORMATION," possibly related to the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). Specific locations and areas are marked, perhaps to show the trajectory or significant locations relevant to the UFO sighting documented in the report.

AF FORM 112—PART II
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: 4708th Defense Wing
DOI: Selfridge AFB, Michigan

On 25 May 1952, at 2115 hours, Mr. ----------- observed an unusual object in the sky from the backyard of his home on Walnut Lake. With him were his wife, -----------. Coordinates of Walnut Lake are 42° 34' N - 83° 20' W. Object was initially thought to be the moon, but was then observed to be drifting slowly to the west. The party then followed it by car for 1/2 mile when it changed directions and headed north. They estimated it to be 1000 feet high. It ----------- stopped their car on a promontory and took a photo of the object. They saw that it would soon enter a large cloud and proceeded to Pine Lake to observe this. Pine Lake is 2 miles north of the Walnut Lake. Observers reasoned that if the object was the moon, it would be passed by that cloud in a natural manner. The object entered the cloud and it was noticed a red glow within the cloud at one time. Other members of the party did not detect this. The object did not appear on the opposite end of the cloud. It then showed up suddenly at a point beneath the cloud, roughly halfway between the earth and the cloud. It had been under observation for approximately 20 minutes proceeding its entrance into the cloud, and, after it reappeared, it was watched for 10 minutes. Another photo was taken at this time. When it was seen to be drifting north again two watchers entered the car and drove to US highway 24 to follow it, but in moving from the Pine Lakes area to the highway the object was lost and could not be found, although the car was driven at a fairly high rate of speed.

Mr. ----------- describes the object as larger than the moon, with no yellow or orange color, and noiseless, with no trail of any kind following it. It moved slowly at all times. The observers estimated it to be 200 feet in diameter and 20 feet thick. It seemed to have light and darker areas on its periphery, suggesting windows. Those were described as looking like "the side of an accordion." The weather in the area was described as hazy, with stars dimly visible; the sky very black, making for great contrast between the object and the sky.

Mr. ----------- rereported a similar object on 27 April 1952. This was reported on AF Form 112 submitted by this headquarters on 1 May 1952. He is employed as an advertising manager of a paint company in Detroit. Mr. ----------- is employed at The Detroit Tank Arsenal.

Mr. ----------- was contacted on 27 May 1952 and stated that, although the photos were developed with special care by a friend of his who is a photographic technician, they were of no value. He indicated that the camera he used was inadequate and time exposures were not taken.

A check was made with the 661st AC & W unit here and nothing unusual was reported in the area at the time of observation. An SA-16 from this base was over this sighting area's approximately 2100 hours at 6000 feet and reported nothing unusual. The crew reported weather bad in the area.

Northern lights phenomena were reported visible on the nights of 26 and 27 May in this general area.

Mr. -----------

AF FORM 112—PART II  
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (sigence)

UNCLASSIFIED

There were no fragments or photographs taken. There was no interception or identification action requested by this headquarters.

10. The only air traffic reported in the area at the time of the sighting were two F-84's which were flying from Indian Springs AFB, Nevada to Bergstrom AFB, Texas, and landed at Bergstrom AFB at 2127 Central Standard time.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

11. Source was sincere, positive and definite about all aspects of this report. 'The other two witnesses were in complete agreement with him, which substantiates his story as to time place and what was seen. The fact that the observers were looking at the sky in the direction in which the objects first came into view, allowed them to observe the objects throughout the entire period they were in the area. Observers were also accustomed to the darkness, having been sitting out of doors looking at the stars for some time. The source stated that it was a sight such as he had never seen before. This statement is reasonable in that the officer had considerable experience as a navigator and was well acquainted with conventional aerial objects. No special significance can be given this report inasmuch as there are no other records of comparable sightings in this area on file at this station.
