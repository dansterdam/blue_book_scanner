AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO.

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

On 25 May 1952, at 2215 hours, Mr. _______ observed an unusual object in the sky from the backyard of his home on Walnut Lake. With him were his wife, three children. Coordinates of Walnut Lake was 42° 34' N - 83° 20' W. Object was initially thought to be the moon, but was then observed to be drifting slowly to the west. The party then followed 14 or 1/2 miles which is changed direction and headed north. They estimated it to be 4000 feet high. Mr. _______ stopped the car on a promontory and took a photo of the object. They say that it would soon enter a large cloud and proceeded to Pine Lake to observe this. Fine Lake is 2 miles north of Walnut Lake. Observers reasoned that if the object was the moon, it would be passed by the cloud. In a mutual moment, the object entered the cloud and was detected a red glow within the cloud at one time. Other members of the party did not notice this. The object did not appear on the opposite end of the cloud. It then showed up suddenly at a point beneath the cloud, roughly halfway between the earth and the cloud. It had been under observation for approximately 20 minutes preceding its entrance into the cloud and, after it reappeared, it was watched for 10 minutes. Another photo was taken at this time. When it was seen to be drifting north again in the same area the car and drove to US Highway 24, to follow it, but in moving from the Fine Lake area to the highway the object was lost and could not be found, although the car was driven at a fairly high rate of speed.

Mr. _______ describes the object as larger than the moon, white to yellow orange in color, and noiseless, with no trail of any kind following it. It moved slowly at all times. The observers estimated it to be 200 feet in diameter and 20 feet thick. It seemed to have light and darker areas on its periphery, suggesting windows. These were described as looking like the side of an accordion. The weather in this area was described as hazy, with stars dimly visible, the sky very black, making for great contrast between the object and the sky.

Mr. _______ reported a similar object on 27 April 1952. This was reported on AF Form 112 submitted by this headquarters on 1 May 1952. He is employed as an advertising manager of a paint company in Detroit. Mr. _______ The Detroit Tank Arena.

Mr. _______ was contacted on 27 May 1952 and stated that, although the photos were developed with special care by a friend of his who is a photographic technician, they were of no value. He indicated that the camera he used was inadequate and time exposures were not taken.

A check was made with the 661st AC & W unit here and nothing unusual was reported in this area at the time of observation. An SA-16 from this base was over the sighting area approximately 2100 hours at 6000 feet and reported nothing unusual. The crew reported weather bad in the area.

Northern lights phenomena were reported visible on the nights of 26 and 27 May in this general area.

Mr. _______ address is _______ Pontiac, Michigan. His residence phone number is _______.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Sigcopy) 3508th OS 2nd Wg, RAFSB, Texas     IR-3-52     PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

There were no fragments or photographs taken. There was no interception or identification action requested by this headquarters.

10. The only air traffic reported in the area at the time of the sighting were two F-84's which were flying from Indian Springs AFB, Nevada to Bergstrom AFB, Texas, and landed at Bergstrom AFB at 2127 Central Standard Time.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

11. Source was sincere, positive and definite about all aspects of this report. The other two witnesses were in complete agreement with him, which substantiates his story as to time place and what was seen. The fact that the observers were looking at the sky in the direction in which the object first came into view, and the observation of objects throughout the entire period they were in the area. Observers were also accustomed to the darkness, having been sitting out of doors. For some time. The source stated that it was a sight such as he had never seen before. This statement is reasonable in that the officer had considerable experience as a navigator and was well acquainted with conventional aerial objects.

No special significance can be given this report inasmuch as there are no other records of comparable sightings in this area on this station.
