ATIC document 120744 (A), Anchorage, Alaska                UNCLASSIFIED

At approximately 0730Z 21 March 1953 and again at 0730Z 5 April 1953, a civilian special investigator employed by the Alaskan Railroad observed from his residence in Anchorage a bright light in the vicinity of Mt. Susitna. This light was approximately 2½ above the horizon and was described as about the same size as a basketball and estimated to be 70 miles away. Weather at the time of sighting on 20 Mar was clear with 20 miles visibility. On 4 Apr there were scattered clouds at 8000', visibility 15 miles. On both occasions the light was observed by two other persons.

ATIC COMMENT: The preparing officer states the following: Investigation of data has not definitely established the cause of source of the light. Possibility exists that the source observed Planet Jupiter which appears very bright in the approximate position of observed light.
