7. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Bright colored, circular object was observed on
PPI scope of GCA/SD. Object moved with a
slight circular movement. Object did not complete own moving target. Indicator was employed. About 6 transient a/c flew through
area during observation.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Non Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
■ Possible Balloon
□ Astronomical
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Meteorite
□ Other

1. Circular object hanging motionless
gives impression of a large balloon.
Soon for long period of time. Upper
air research balloon would seem a possibility here.

I.   Description of Incident

From 1140 to 2215 a ground radar station picked up an unidentified ob-
ject on its scope. It appeared as a stationary object with a slight circular
motion which did not cancel out the moving target indicating was employed.
The sighting showed that its altitude was 5,000 feet at 8 1/2 miles from the
station. Weather conditions were fair with alto cumulus clouds, no temperature
inversions present in the area. Eight transient aircraft flew through the area
during the radar observation and an P-51 was directed to investigate. The pilot
saw nothing unusual. The radar operators involved have had several years
experience.

II.  Discussion of Incident

Photographs were taken of the PPI scope but have not been received by ATIC.
There is a possibility that local cloud formations may have caused a spurious
radar return. Other than this there appears to be no plausible explanation for
the incident.

III. Conclusion

Possibly weather phenomena.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object

TO:   Commanding Officer
       Pope Air Force Base
       Fort Bragg, North Carolina

1. In regard to your FLYOBPT reporting a radar sighting of an unidentified aerial object on 10 December 1952, 1420Z hours, the Air Technical Intelligence Center is forwarding Electronics Data Sheets, one of which it is requested be filled out by the radar personnel involved in the sighting. The remaining data sheets can be retained by your office in the event of future unknown electronic detections and be sent on with the standard Air Force Form 112.

2. In particular reference to the subject sighting, it is requested that the following questions be answered and included in the Form 112:

    a. Did the aircraft sent out to intercept the object observe it at any time?

    b. Did the object gain or lose altitude during the eight hours of observation?

    c. What was the exact altitude of the temperature inversion mentioned in the initial report?

    d. Finally, were azimuth and elevation readings taken from the radar?

3. Your cooperation in forwarding the PPI scope photographs and the AF Form 112 as expeditiously as possible would be appreciated by the Air Technical Intelligence Center since an attempted analysis hinges on their receipt.
