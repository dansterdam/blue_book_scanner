THE UNKNOWN

1. The sighting was reported by five observers who saw a bright object in the sky on 7 May 1957, at 8:35 AM.

2. The object was first observed near the W 104th St. overpass in Cleveland, Ohio, and was then tracked from the Sohio Research Laboratory in East Cleveland, Ohio, with radar.

3. The radar operators tracked the object at an estimated speed of more than 1,000 mph.

4. The object was observed to execute abrupt turns and maneuvers, disappearing and reappearing during the observation period.

Case 4750

1. REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

2. DATE OF SIGHTING: 16 May 1957

3. TIME OF SIGHTING: 2200

4. LOCATION: Collinsville, Illinois

5. WITNESS: Mr. Robert M. Olsson, E.E.

6. NARRATIVE: On 16 May 1957 at approximately 2200 hours, Mr. Robert M. Olsson, E.E., Collinsville, Illinois, reported sighting an unidentified flying object. Mr. Olsson stated that he was in his backyard when he observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving in an erratic manner. He immediately went into his house and obtained a camera with a telephoto lens and began taking photographs of the object.

7. EVALUATION: The photographs taken by Mr. Olsson show a very small and indistinct object which could not be conclusively identified as an unusual aerial phenomenon. The object appears to be a distant light source rather than a solid object. No other corroborating evidence was obtained.

8. CONCLUSION: This case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.

9. DISPOSITION: Photographs submitted with case file.
