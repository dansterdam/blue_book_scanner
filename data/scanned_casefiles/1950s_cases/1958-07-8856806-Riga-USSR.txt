The color of the object was metallic gray. It glittered like a star. S said the object appeared to be 30 cm long but he did not give any comparison. Sound was not heard at all. The object arrived from NE in an oblique flying position and seemed to be climbing. When flying over S's head and during the going away flight the object seemed to be in horizontal position at a steady altitude. The object flew off towards SW. It was visible for a period of a few seconds and disappeared behind trees.

It was sighted without observation aids. During the observation period the moon was shining and the stars were out. The lights in the city were blacked out as there was an air-raid drill which started at 0030 hrs and ended after 5 went to bed, there was an air-raid drill.

On his way home S saw a few military cargo and radio trucks travelling in the direction of YELGAVA (5659N/23E). No act were not observed. S never thought or asked questions about the UFO object. He had seen it. There were no publication in the newspaper or radio and also no rumors among the population.

I. PREAMBLE:
S, 30, was of average intelligence, cooperative and willingly answering questions. His ability to remember details, to read maps, and to estimate distances and dimensions was average. S had a basically good educational background. He was very self-confident and somewhat temperamental. Inconsistencies were not noticed.

S, while living in RIGA (5659N/2E09E) from 1952 to Jul 58, was a streetcar driver and mechanic employed by the municipal streetcar company. He observed the UFO after leaving the RIGA streetcar depot in the early morning of 24 Jul 58 after late duty hrs. Info was obtained from own observation, unless otherwise specified. Probability of info could not be judged.

II. UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, RIGA (5659N/2E09E)
S observed the UFO around 0030 hrs on 24 Jul 58 right after he and a few fellow workers stepped out of the streetcar depot. S stood in the street and had a limited view of the sky. His attention was called to the UFO by one of the fellow workers who pointed up to the sky and said: "Look out, there's a sputnik." S looked up and saw a glistering pipe shaped object emitting bluish-gray exhaust. S was at its end. S had the impression that the object was illuminated but he did not see any light source.
