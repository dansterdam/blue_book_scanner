Date of Information: 26 April 52

Capt. [redacted], aircraft maintenance officer and instructor pilot, C-47, 4338 Troop Carrier Wing, Rhein Main AS, Germany.

Capt. Albert E. Prudence, wing intelligence officer

III. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE:
Capt. [redacted] has been a rated officer nine years. Judgment can be trusted. His observations were confirmed by 1st pilot, who has been a rated officer for 3 years.

IV. SUMMARY:
Capt. [redacted] and Lt. [redacted] were on a local instrument training flight in a C-47 at Rhein Main Air Base on 26 April 52. They observed a bright light of another aircraft on a collision course. Capt. Wisnewski took evasive action when the light appeared to be on a collision course. Talking it might be a leading light of another aircraft, he continued toward Frankfurt Airways and reported no other aircraft in the vicinity.

The bright light was in view for about two minutes. When last seen it was climbing at a high rate of speed in a northward direction.

Visibility was five to 10 miles and there were scattered clouds. However, the two officers reported they could not distinguish any shape to the object, except it appeared to be a thin circular or light approximately two feet in diameter. Capt. Wisnewski added that it remained in the exhaust of a job plane.
