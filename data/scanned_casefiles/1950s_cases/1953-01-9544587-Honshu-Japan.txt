The following is a report of an unidentified flying object that observed from
Tachikawa Air Base, Honshu, Japan and is essentially a basic observer incident. No
further action is contemplated at this time. This is a technical nature that
could be used in identifying the objects, but it serves to verify the observation.

The object was observed by (b)(1) and (b)(2) of Headquarters Squadron and (b)(2)
of MATS/OPS, APO 323. Both airmen observed the object from the approximate center
of MATS/OPS, Tachikawa Air Base on 20 January 1953. The object, as best could be
appeared to the East Northeast of their position, towards Fuchu and Tokyo. The
time of observation was 1715 hours, 23 January 1953. The sky was dark and overcast,
darkening, although the western sky was lit by the setting sun.

The length of observation was short, not more than two seconds. The object
appeared high in the sky, traveled downward at an angle of 70 degrees from its
vertical, spinning. First no trail, then orange to brownish-red in color with
white before disappearing. The trail was more than ten times the object's diameter in length. The sky was colored orange as the object disappeared.

Both airmen made estimates as to size, altitude and distance, but because no
single factor could be verified, these estimates are considerable unreliable. One
airman placed the size of the object as approximately 1/10 the size of a baseball and
stated that the trail was 1 mile long. It was also stated that the object diameter was 1/10 the length of the trail, or approximately 528 feet. Since these
two sites estimates vary so greatly, no dependence can be given the altitude and
distance estimates, because they would depend upon the size.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DIG OF 1st, FEAF/GPES, AGO 223 EXTRACT 1-53 2 2

D/I USAF COMMENT:

1. As the Blew Service announced at the Ret Headquarters briefing to a historical unit now from the 5th Air Force, this report is considered to be of interest, with reflections for the April and Russian activity. The significance of this report, however, the only known balloons launched from Honshu at this time. These balloons, launched from Honshu 462, traveled rapidly eastward.

2. No information is available concerning the origin, type, or other unusual incidents which might account for this balloon.
