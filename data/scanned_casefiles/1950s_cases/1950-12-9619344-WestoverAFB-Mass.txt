3. One T-33 jet aircraft departed Westover AFB 0811 and returned 0930. At least three C-54 aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Westover Air Force Base at the time object was sighted. The number and type of commercial aircraft in vicinity at time is unknown.

4. No testing devices had been released prior to sighting.

5. Interrogator: Capt Lloyd A. Olsen, Wing Intelligence Officer, Westover Air Force Base.

E. Interrogator's Comment:
The attracting noise may possibly have been caused by some commercial vehicle or apparatus in vicinity of observed and object sighted may have been false vision due to bright sun or other reflecting object nearby. The observer appeared sincere in reporting the incident but was unable to furnish specific details due to the short time object was in view. Although the observer stated the object was in view approximately 30 seconds, at the interrogator's opinion the time was much less, probably 5 to 10 seconds. Type of observed aircraft that he was familiar with were conventional and jet aircraft and that the sound which attracted his attention was different from these.
