3. One T-33 jet aircraft departed Westover AFB 0811 and returned 0930. It stated it had sighted an object in the vicinity of Newburyport, Mass over Air Force Base at the time object was sighted. The number and type of encountered aircraft is unknown.

4. No testing devices had been released prior to sighting.

5. Interrogator: Capt. Lloyd A. CILLESEN, Wing Intelligence Officer, Westover Air Force Base.

E. INTERROGATOR'S COMMENTS:
The attracting noise may possibly have been caused by some commercial vehicle or aircraft in the vicinity, and object sighted may have been false vision due to bright sun or other reflecting object nearby. The observer stated the object was in view approximately 15-20 seconds. It is the interrogator's opinion that the "object" was some type of reflecting light phenomenon and that the sound which attracted his attention was not connected with the "object" sighted.
