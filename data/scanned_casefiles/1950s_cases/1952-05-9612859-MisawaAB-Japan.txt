D/I PEAK COMMENT:

1. A check with Japanese observatories has shown no increase in meteorite activity and no sightings of unusual phenomena in recent months.

2. Air Weather Service normally launches lighted weather balloons at night. Erratic behavior of a lighted weather balloon, together with physical limitations of night vision might account for such reports.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

15 May 1952

STATEMENT

At 2200 hours on 8 May 1952 while steering due north to Misawa Air Base, I observed a flash of light at eyelevel. The light lasted for approximately 3-5 seconds starting with a broad greenish-blue streak and ending in a puff of orange-red flame. The light first appeared at approximately 030° to my starboard and moved downward very slightly from my port to starboard.

Previous to this flash of light I had been observing (for approx 2 min.) a flashing white light which appeared to be on the horizon and in the same direction as the light described above. After observing this light I flew north of Misawa Air Base on the coastline to a point approx. 30 miles north of the base looking for any remains of the falling light previously seen. While doing this I was in contact with the GCI controller and upon pancaking I made a verbal report to him of what I had observed.

AF FORM 112-PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

CLASSIFICATION: CLASSIFIED

Report No: TR-1-52
Date: 15 May 1952

STATEMENT

At 2200 hours on 8 May 1952 we were flying north along the coast line about a mile south of Misawa Air Base. The pilot called my attention to a flashing light which was on the surface out at the one o'clock position. I was watching this, trying to see if it had any code sequence when I saw this streak of bright light in the air and at our altitude (7000 ft), which was out at the same angle that I had been looking (1 o'clock). It was traveling in a path of a falling arc, slightly toward us, moving in an easterly to a westwardly direction. When first sighted it had a bright green color which changed to yellow then to an orange red and died out of sight as though it had disintegrated in a motionless position. It just stopped, got real bright and died out. Its color seemed to linger rather than have a tail like a shooting star. It was fast moving, bright and of short duration. As for its duration which I could hardly estimate, it did last long enough for me to say "Look, Look, Look" to the pilot over our live interphone and for him to answer. I could not see anything I could recognise as a solid mass, only as light.
