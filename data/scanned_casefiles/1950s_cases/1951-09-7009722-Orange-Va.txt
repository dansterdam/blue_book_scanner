discrepancies in the photos have been found and the photographer is being reinterrogated by the O.S.I.

One school of thought of the people in the Lubbock area is that the objects were some type of migratory birds reflecting light from the city. Several people reported that they definitely knew the objects were ducks, because they could see ducks in flight. It is very possible. Some of the people who were looking for the object did see ducks as there were not quite enough people over flying the area. It is significant that those people who saw ducks were definitely able to identify the objects as ducks, or some type of bird, because they could see the white or black outline. However, other people over the same area could not determine that they were ducks.

The college professors do not believe the theory that the objects were birds, but they are positive they were not ducks. If they were flying, they could be relatively low to give the illusion of high speed. An occasional flight of birds might pass low over a city or a clear night, but it is highly doubtful if they would continue to do this for several nights. Migratory birds usually try to keep away from cities.

The Federal Wild Life Game Warden was visited and although he was not familiar with the incident he doubted if the objects were birds. He stated that they could have been, mostly a pure white breast, but unless there was a sudden influx of the birds into the Lubbock area, the rare wardon doubted if there would be enough of these birds to make as many flights as were observed.

If the photos are authentic, the objects very probably are not ducks because an experienced photographer from the Lubbock Avalanche Newspaper attempted to get photos of ducks using both natural light and flash, but failed.

The investigation of this incident is continuing. It is probably the most unique incident in the history of Project Grudge in that it was observed so many times by a scientifically trained group of observers. These people are continuing to attend to arrive at a solution for the phenomena. They had previously lost interest after several weeks of observations because they believed that the object was some new Air Force aircraft or missile.

The photographs are now at the Photographic Reconnaissance Laboratory at Wright Air Development Center for analysis.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

fairly precise formation. The first frame, No.4, was not
plotted because of extreme blurring, but frames 5, 7 and 8
were plotted as Charts I, II and III respectively. Chart IV
is a composite of Charts I, II and III. In it the spots
from the previous charts, that appear relatively fixed in
the formation, are shown as heavy black ink spots. The
relatively moving spots are shown in light pencil--the
first position of these shifting spots is light red, as
in Chart I; the second position, spaced between the heavy
spots, is in black pencil, as from Chart II; and the final
position is shown in light green.

5. According to the microscopic examinations, spot
brightness range could be expressed as weak, average, and
bright, corresponding to faint, average, or heavy spot
densities. The faint spots in the moving row are under-
scored, while the bright spots are circled. Only those
spots in the fixed row that are alike in all three negatives
are indicated in the same way.

6. There is the appearance of two extra spots,
outside the regular rows. One spot is to the lower right
in all three charts, while the spot shows only faintly in
the No.7 negative and was missed in plotting Chart II; it
appears in position at the left end of the moving row in
Chart III.

CONCLUSIONS

7. There is relative movement within the formation of spots, so that they are not lights on a fixed object. The relative motion is such that it appears unlikely that they are co-planar and photographed from different angles. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the moving spots are in any kind of straight line.

8. The angular size of the formation, at the camera lens, is very nearly the same in all cases. The formation is, however, slightly larger in Chart II, or Frame 7, than in the others. The angular size corresponds to an object size of 310 ± 30 ft, seen by the camera 1 mile away. The actual size of the formation may be calculated from this ratio, if the actual distance from the camera can be determined. This image size is actually 0.12", formed by a 2" focal length lens in the camera used.

9. Although the image size in Frame 8 is about 2½ less than in Frame 7, suggesting that the objects are receding from the camera, the aspect of the "V" formation does not correspond to a horizontal "V", travelling parallel to the earth's surface unless at an enormous altitude. Such motion at conventional altitudes would

Here is the text from the document:

require the "V" to flatten, eventually becoming a straight line, but the "V" in Frame 8 is a slightly smaller angle than in Frame 7.

10. The orientation of the "V" formation is the same on all negatives. If the formation did actually pass directly over the camera station, all photographs were taken either before or after, but not both. It is obvious that the image would be inverted on two successive negatives if they were taken on an approaching and then a receding slant angle.

11. The pattern of spot brightness is such to prove conclusively that all 3 frames--5, 7 and 8--were exposed to the same object pattern of spots. However, the relative positions of these spots varies, as described above.

RECOMMENDATIONS

12. In the event that further assistance is requested of this Laboratory, exposure tests should be made under identical conditions to determine the spot nature required to produce the observed densities, and to determine the amount of camera blur produced by an experienced photographer in "panning", to track a moving target at night.

LUBBOCK, TEXAS
25 August 1951

On the evenings of 25 August 1951, 31 August 1951, and 1 September 1951, flights of unidentified objects were observed over Lubbock, Texas; in some instances there were several flights per evening. The description of the objects varied to some extent, but it is generally agreed that it was a "V" or "U" shaped set of light-like objects. In summary, an amateur photographer, turned over photographs to the Air Force which he claims are of two of the flights. Disagreement among the witnesses is on the number of lights in the strongest and whether it was "V" or "U" shaped. The flight was on the SW or N-S. The object appeared brighter than stars and had a yellow or blue tint. In most cases no noise was reported, but a few witnesses stated they heard a "whoosh."

Many witnesses reported the incident, but the most technically competent observers were probably Professor [redacted], Head of Petroleum Engineering, Dr. [redacted], Professor of Chemical Engineering, and Dr. [redacted], Professor of Geology, all of Texas Tech. In addition to being the most competent, these witnesses were among the first to see the object and viewed it on subsequent occasions under controlled circumstances. For their initial sighting the professors were gathered together discussing astronomy on the evening of 25 August 1951. At 2110 they happened to observe the first flight of the object, which they described as a rough semi-circle of lights. A second object passed over three minutes later. The witnesses estimated the angular velocity to be 30° per second. During subsequent observations the professors confirmed their estimate of the velocity by using protractors and stop watches. Attempts were also made to get an estimate of the elevation by viewing the object from several locations at the same time and using trigonometric methods, and also by using clouds of known height. These attempts were not considered successful.

In 1959 Dr J Allen Hynek contacted one of the professors at Texas Tech regarding this case. This professor informed Dr Hynek that he had conducted an extensive study of the Lubbock sighting and determined that they were definitely birds.

The Air Force conclusion is that birds, with street lights reflecting from them, were the probable cause of this sighting. The angular velocity of 30° per second seems rather high for birds during migratory flights (approximately 60 MPH at 160 feet altitude). It is probable that the angular velocity was less. In all instances the witnesses were located in an area where their eyes were probably dark adapted, therefore making the objects appear brighter.

Mr [redacted], when taking his pictures, had to do so by "panning" his camera (swinging with the object's motion). Panning is quite difficult and the relatively high degree of success of this photographer is further indication that the angular velocity of the object was not as high as estimated.

The kind of birds responsible for this sighting is not known, but it is highly probable that they were ducks or plovers. Since plovers do not usually fly in formations of more than six or seven, ducks become more probable. The fact that this was late summer, and that the objects consistently flew to the south tends to substantiate the conclusion that the objects of this sighting were migratory birds.

THE FINAL WORD ON

Flying Saucers?

At the U. of Colorado a new all-out attack on UFOs has been launched — BY L. JEROME STANTON
Author of "Flying Saucers: Hoax or Reality"

Are we being spied upon and studied by intelligent beings from outer space, as we study the primitive aborigines of central Australia and New Guinea? Is the U.S. Air Force deliberately withholding information about flying saucers, for fear that releasing the truth would trigger a panic? Why do we still know so little about the true nature of unidentified flying objects? In this time when science says other intelligent life almost surely exists elsewhere in our galaxy, these questions are being asked by a great many people who formerly would have laughed off such thoughts as pure fantasy.

Almost 20 years ago a news story about "flying saucers" flashed over the press wires, startling our nation and much of the civilized world. From that moment, a world-wide interest in unidentified flying objects has stubbornly stayed alive, despite efforts of authorities and others to retire and debunk them.

Fortunately one new factor has entered the picture that bids fair to resolve some of our doubts and puzzlement. On October 7, 1966, a contract was awarded to the University of Colorado to conduct a scientific investigation of UFO sighting and report findings to the U.S. Air Force, with recommendations for future operation of the Air Force's own Project Blue Book UFO inquiry. The Colorado project will then be reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences. Funded at somewhat more than $300,000, the study will analyze UFO reports, and actually assign scientists to the field to study UFOs extremely limited. Indeed, with a staff limited most of the time to one commissioned officer, one noncom and two clerks, it's amazing that Project Blue Book could do any job effectively.

The first modern sighting of a UFO occurred June 24th, 1947, near Mt. Rainier in Washington. A veteran private pilot named Kenneth Arnold, while flying his own light aircraft, saw nine large, silvery objects shaped like inverted plates or saucers, flying in a reversed-echelon formation. Arnold had described the objects as moving "like a saucer skipped across a pond," and from this a reporter devised the name "flying saucer."

In the two decades since that episode, literally thousands of UFO sightings have been reported from all parts of the world.

In January, 1966, Major Donald E. Keyhoe, a retired Marine Corps officer, authored an article for "True" magazine, in which he insisted that flying saucers were real, physical objects, not of this planet. The article touched off a sensation. But solid evidence such as good, close-up photographs or motion pictures (or debris of a crashed saucer) proved impossible to get, and conclusions had to be based solely on the accounts of eye-witnesses.

The Air Force began the first official investigation until 1948, when a book "Anatomy of a Phenomenon," by Jacques Vallee, a French scientist living in the U.S., was published. Soberly scientific in tone, it gave an unusually complete and authoritative summary of the entire history of the flying saucer-UFO phenomenon. It also opened the eyes of many people to the fact that sightings were world-wide.

Then in the early hours of August 2, 1965, authorities in adjacent parts of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas were flooded with calls reporting UFOs, many of the reports coming from police officers in highway patrol cars. One group of objects was seen for about 30 minutes flying in a diamond formation over the area around Shawnee, Okla. They were lights of indefinite shape, that changed color randomly from orange-red to white to blue-green and back again. Radar at Tinker and Cannon Air Force Bases in the area tracked four objects that coincided with objects seen by eyewitnesses, according to a statement issued by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. The radar tracking was later denied by the Air Force, but the denial was contradicted by a nine-page report from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. The confusion was only increased when the Project Blue Book later stated that the Air Force had seen Rigel, Capella and Aldebaran, and the planet Jupiter, seen under peculiar local weather conditions, had been the cause.

Visit to Air Defense Command Headquarters

Lt Ruppelt of ATIA-2 visited the Office of the Deputy for Intelligence at Air Defense Command Headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on 5 November 1951. The object of the visit was to coordinate work on the investigations of sightings of unconventional aircraft. ADC has no program for investigating such sightings, however, they are very much interested in the investigations conducted by ATIA and wish to cooperate to the fullest extent. They suggested that ATIA prepare a letter outlining what steps should be taken in reporting sightings and this has been done.

In addition, ADC requested that they receive a copy of the monthly status report of Project 10073. (Confidential)

Investigation of Unconventional Aircraft

A trip was made to Lubbock, Texas, on 6 November 1951 by ATIA-2 personnel to investigate the reports of an unidentified aerial object which has been seen over Lubbock. The object, which has been described as a series of lights, was observed over the city on at least twelve occasions. The speed could not be judged due to the inability to get an altitude measurement but the angular velocity was 300°/second. In addition, a unique incident was observed on about twelve occasions by a group of six Texas Technical College faculty members, all of whom have Ph.D. degrees. Their fields of specialty covered physics, chemistry, geology, and mathematics.

Photos of the object were taken by a college student and these are being analyzed by the Photo Lab at WADC. These photos appear to be authentic but are being double-checked.

The possibility of known aircraft has proved negative. There is a possibility that the objects were some type of night flying migratory birds, although no conclusions have yet been reached. (Confidential)

[Most of the first paragraph is obscured by black redaction marks]

The location of the sighting was about 2½ miles north of Matador, Texas on US Highway 70. The terrain to the west of the road is rolling for about 10 miles to a line of foothills. The land is generally a rocky terrain with scattered flat terrain, with the first 300 yards open flat terrain. To the west the land is flat for approximately 30 miles, strongly wooded, and the next 1000 yards is open. At the time of the sighting, the wind was from the southwest at 10 and 50 MPH.

The object sighted was described as looking like a yellow rectangular tomato, aluminum or silver in color that reflected with some small readily visible windows. The object was first noticed by the observer toward the smaller end. Only one object was sighted and it was moving though not rapidly. The small portion of the object was in clear view, and the rest was somewhat obscured. No definite shape could not be outlined but did see one thought the object was about 40 feet long and 15 feet in diameter.

The second time the sun was sighting brightly but very low in the west. Conditions were clear with some clouds, thin broken clouds at 25,000 feet, visibility 15 miles. Temperature 90°, barometric pressure 29.92, wind from the north northwest at 15 miles per hour.

[Last paragraph partially obscured by redaction marks]

It is the recommendation of this officer that [redacted] be interviewed to get more information of the sighting on the first or the second time the object was observed for a greater length of time.

1. SYNOPSIS: Mysterious objects appearing to be "strings of beads" traveling at high speeds have allegedly been observed over Lubbock, Texas. Subject phenomenon were allegedly observed by three faculty members from Texas Technological College, Lubbock, Texas, on 25 August 1951. These objects appeared to be V-shaped formations giving off a distinct glow, which may have been reflections from lights on the ground. The observations by the three college professors were later vouched for by four other witnesses. Similar phenomena was observed by one of the Lubbock, Texas, who is alleged to have taken photographs of the objects. Numerous other witnesses to similar occurrences have reported varied accounts to reporters of the Lubbock Avalanche Journal, on 1 and 2 September 1951. At Matador, Texas, on 31 August 1951, at 12:15 P. M. CST, two women reported a "strange wingless aircraft" passed within 150 feet of their automobile and disappeared a short time later.

2. DETAILS: Numerous reports have been received by news sources at Lubbock, Texas of strange unidentified objects in flight over Lubbock, Texas and vicinity since 25 August 1951. First observation of such flying phenomenon was reported by three faculty members of Texas Technological College, at Lubbock, Texas. These professors were: Professor and head of the Petroleum Engineering Department; Dr. ████████, Professor of Chemical Engineering; and Dr. ████████, Professor of Geology. These individuals stated that on Saturday evening at 2110 hours, a group of objects flying in a rough semicircle or crescent formation was sighted flying from the northeast to the southwest at an "incredible speed". These three professors were unable to give any complete description of the objects; however, they

New Guinea is the U.S. Air Force deliberately withholding information about flying saucers, for fear that releasing the truth would trigger a panic?

Why do we still know so little about the true nature of unidentified flying objects in this time when science says other intelligent life almost surely exists somewhere in our galaxy, these questions are being asked by a great many people who formerly would have laughed off such thoughts as pure fantasy.

Almost 20 years ago a news story about "flying saucers" faded into past view, starting our nation and much of the civilized world. From that moment, a world-wide interest in unidentified flying objects has stubbornly stayed alive, despite efforts of authorities and others to refute and debunk them.

Fortunately one new factor has entered the picture that bids fair to resolve some of our doubts and puzzlement. On October 9, 1966, a contract was awarded to the University of Colorado to conduct a scientific investigation of UFO sightings and report findings to the U.S. Air Force, with recommendations for future operation of the Air Force's own Project Blue Book UFO inquiry.

The Colorado study, funded at somewhat more than $500,000, the study will analyze UFO reports, and actually assign scientific status to the field to study UFOs at first hand, if that proves feasible. Guaranteed a completely free hand by the Air Force, the inquiry should do much to quiet loud critics of Project Blue Book, and also to allay any public doubts and fears. It is, in fact, the first really scientific attack on the UFO enigma yet set in motion in the United States.

The critical problem of national security makes an all-out scientific attack on the UFO puzzle seem long overdue. But since the first reports of modern times, the subject has been beset by unreliable notoriety-seekers, hoaxers and plain crack-pots, so that most serious scientists have shied away from the problem. The nearest approach to a scientific investigation, the 20-year USAF study called Project Blue Book, has been

could do any job effectively.

The first modern sighting of a UFO occurred June 24th, 1947, near Mt. Rainier in Washington. A veteran private pilot named Kenneth Arnold, while flying his own light aircraft, saw nine large, silvery objects shaped like inverted plates or saucers, flying in a reversed-echelon formation. Arnold had described the objects as moving "like a saucer skipped across a pond," and from this a reporter devised the name "flying saucer."

Flying saucers
have been seen
around the world

In the two decades since that episode, literally thousands of UFO sightings have been reported from all parts of the world.

In January, 1950, Major Donald E. Keyhoe, a retired Marine Corps officer, authored an article for "True" magazine, in which he insisted that flying saucers were real, physical objects, and that they came from some place not on our own planet Earth.

The article touched off a sensation. But solid evidence such as good, close-up photographs or motion pictures (or debris of a crashed saucer) proved impossible to get, and conclusions had to be based solely on the accounts of eye-witnesses.

The Air Force began the first official investigation of the more impressive reports a few weeks after the Arnold sighting, but the effort was reduced to practically nothing early in 1950. Nation-wide interest and publicity compelled a widening of the inquiry.

By 1952, reports reached a dizzying peak. But time passed and public interest dwindled.

In the following eight years UFO continued to be reported over the U.S. and many other parts of the world. Press and radio now gave more attention to "contactee" accounts than to sober factual episodes. Project Blue Book plodded on, although proposals to put a team of scientists in the field with instruments for direct observation of a UFO were never actually put into effect. So matters

Soberly scientific in tone, it gave an unusually complete and authoritative summary of the entire history of the flying saucer-UFO phenomenon. It also opened the eyes of many people to the fact that sightings were world-wide.

Then in the early hours of August 7, 1965, authorities in adjacent parts of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas were flooded with calls reporting UFOs, many of the reports coming from police officers in highway patrol cars. One group of objects was seen for about 50 minutes flying in a diamond formation over the area around Shawnee, Okla. They were lights of indefinite shape, that changed color randomly from orange-red to white to blue-green and back again. Radar at Tinker and Carwell Air Force Bases in the area tracked four objects that coincided with objects seen by eye-witnesses, according to a statement issued by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. The radar tracking was later denied by the Air Force, but the denial was contradicted by a nine-page report from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.

The conclusion was only increased when the Project Blue Book officer later reported solemnly that the stars Rigel, Capella and Aldebaran, and the planet Jupiter, seen under peculiar local weather conditions, had been the cause.

One sighting
brings reports
of others

The celebrated incident at Exeter, N.H., occurred during the early morning hours of September 3, 1965. Norman Muscarello, an 18-year-old Exeter resident, was badly frightened by a large object that swooped silently over the highway. He informed the local police and was driven back to the spot by Officer Bertrand. The object returned and was seen at close range and low by both Muscarello and Bertrand, and by Officer David Hunt, in another car. The object was circular, about 100 feet in diameter, and in addition to the overall orange-red glow, showed a pattern of smaller, brighter lights that waxed and waned in regular rhythm.

The Exeter incident brought to light the case of the Halls. While undergoing treatment for a period of amnesia, Mr. and Mrs. Hall told their psychoanalyst a strange story of having been captured and interrogated by beings in a weird flying vehicle some two years before.

During 1966, in addition to many other reports from more remote parts of the world, a persistent

Here is the OCR text from the document:

series of peculiar lights was seen over Wanaque reservoir in Northern New Jersey. Similar lights were reported near Hillsdale, Mich., by many residents of the area, who loudly contradicted semi-official statements that marsh gas was responsible. Still more odd-shaped glowing lights were seen and photographed over Long Island. This time the official explanation put the blame on the star Sirius.

In January, 1967, two youngsters, Daniel and Grant Jarolaw, in Harrison Township, northeast of Detroit, snapped photos of something that looked like a big hamburger and was the size of a helicopter. The photos were sent to Dr. J. Allen Hynck, chairman of the Astronomy Department at Northwestern University, who has investigated reported sightings for the Air Force. His comment at the time was that the photos did not "indicate an obvious hoax," but that they required analysis.

Undoubtedly, the photos will also be shown to the University of Colorado group.

As matters now stand, there is anything but agreement, either within the body of the general public, or among various groups of UFO buffs. At one extreme of the organized UFO groups are the Clubs and individuals who swear they have had actual contact with intelligent beings who come in flying saucers.

At the other end of the gamut of UFO groups is NICAP, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, of Washington, D.C., with Major Keyhoe as Director, and Richard Hall as Assistant Director. With a membership of about 11,000 claimed, NICAP is the largest organization and has a fairly percentage of scientific, technical, military and law-enforcement personnel.

Somewhere in the middle is the Saucer and Unexplained Celestial Events Research Society, of Ft. Lee, N.J., and New York City. SAUCERS was founded in 1954, claims about 7,000 members and holds a broader view of UFO phenomena than does NICAP.

At present, NICAP sees the contacted and their claims and believes that UFOs are real physical objects and that they are under the control of intelligent beings. NICAP has had a long-term disagreement with the Air Force Project Blue Book method of investigation, but is now cooperating with the University of Colorado inquiry.

The SAUCERS organization believes that there is overwhelming evidence that so-called flying saucers are probably of extraterrestrial origin and most likely came from the planet Mars.

All believers are very real. Beliefs of the farther-out saucer fans are more diffuse, but all agree that they are real. Many consider that UFOs come from planets of other suns than ours, and are operated by beings more advanced than we. Many insist that the Visitors mean only Infinite Good, have visited earth many times in the past, and are the cause of many of our religious beliefs in gods, miracles and legends.

Is it possible to choose between these different views? For many the answer apparently is "No", and it will probably remain so until a saucer crashes in Central Park, or the University of Colorado project is completed. UFOrtunately, UFOs seem to be far more reliable than earthly aircraft, for no authenticated debris of a crashed saucer has come to light.

Nevertheless, if you aren't the cover some night and find yourself confronted by a small, greenish individual who politely asks for the loan of a cup of uranium, don't slam the door; it may be the Martian ambassador—victim of the interplanetary equivalent of an empty gas tank.

(THE END)

Appendix I
LUBBOCK, TEXAS - 25 August 1951

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE INCIDENT

The first of a series of sightings related to this incident occurred the evening of 25 August 1951 at approximately 10:10 CST. Four Texas Technical College professors were sitting in the backyard of one of the professor's home observing meteorites in conjunction with a study of micrometeorites being carried out by the college. At 10:30 they observed a group of lights pass overhead from N to S. The lights had about the same intensity as high cirrus clouds on a no moonlit night. The altitude was not determined but they traveled at a high rate of speed. The pattern or the lights was a loose crescent containing 15 to 30 individual lights. Later in the evening a similar incident was observed during a period of about three weeks a total of approximately twelve (12) such flights were observed.

The group of men included:
a. The Head of the [redacted] Department
b. Professor of [redacted] has Ph.D.
c. Professor of [redacted] has Ph.D.
d. Professor of [redacted] has Ph.D.

Besides the above four men, the following have observed the incidents:
a. Professor [redacted] has Ph.D.
b. Graduate student working on Ph.D.

In addition, a Professor of Astronomy was consulted on the incident, but he did not observe any of these flights.

The above mentioned men took a personal interest in the phenomena and undertook a study of the objects. Attempts were made to obtain an altitude measurement by triangulation, out a measured base line using a perpendicular to the wind light, 4th of the object and placing angle measuring devices at the end of the base line. However, all their attempts failed because the objects did not appear on the nights the observers were waiting for them.

From the series of observations, the following facts were obtained:
a. The angular velocity of the object was very nearly 300 of arc per second.
b. There was no sound that could be attributed to the object.
c. The flight path of the object was from N to S in the majority of the flights although some were NE to Sd.
d. On several nights there were two or three flights.

UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

e. The color of the lights was blue-green.

f. There were from 15 to 30 separate lights in each formation.

g. The first two flights observed were a semi-circle of lights but in subsequent flights there was no orderly arrangement.

h. The object always appeared at an angle of about 45° from horizontal in the north and disappeared at about 45° in the south. The object did not practically come into view as would an aircraft, some aching from a distance, neither did it gradually disappear.

i. There was no apparent change in size as the object passed overhead.

j. The "angular man" was estimated to be 10°.

Attempts were made to obtain the relative height of the object in respect to clouds, however, time did not permit. It was unsuccessful due to the fact that the objects passed between widely scattered clouds.

Attempts were made to determine whether or not there was any form between the lights by trying to see stars between the lights. These also was unsuccessful due to the short time the object was in view.

This phenomena was observed by at least one hundred people in and around Lubbock, Texas. Some of these people in the opinion of the observers were likely reflecting lights from the city.

On the evening of 31 August 1951 at about 2350 C.T., a college freshman from Texas Tech observed a flight of the unidentified objects pass over his home. The flight was observed through an open window. Upon observing the first flight of the objects, the observer obtained his camera and went into the backyard of his home in an attempt to get photographs of additional flights of the objects.

(Continued: This would be logical as by 31 August 1951 these flights of the objects were well known, and the college student, like many others, was well aware.) Two more flights of the object allegedly did occur and were photographed. Two photos of one flight, and three photos of another flight were taken. The photographer lost one of the negatives but the other was lost or misplaced by the photographer. The photographs show a V-shaped formation of lights. In one photo a single V of lights appears, while in three photos a double V, two separate lights, which appear to be distinct light sources, vary in intensity.

(See Appendix II for possibly related incidents.)

II. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION

A. Trip to Lubbock, Texas

A trip was made to Lubbock, Texas, on 6-9 November 1951 to obtain more details on the incident. Many people who had seen the object or who were involved in the incident were interviewed. A conference was held with the college professors and they prepared a signed statement describing the objects they observed.

UNCLASSIFIED

The photographic was interrog., in conjunction with OSI, in regard
to the photographs of the objects. His account of the incident noted: Joined,
and there were no obvious indications of a hoax. The photographer had previously
been interrogated by the Lubbock newspaper and the photos inspected by Associated
Press and Life Magazine representatives. It was their opinion that the photos
were not obviously a hoax. The college professors were doubtful as to whether
or not the photographs were of the same object that they had observed because:

1. They had never observe a V-shaped formation of lights. This is
not too significant, however, as the arrangement of the lights that were observed
varied and since there were several flights the college professors mostly did
not see the flights that were photographed. In addition, the photographer states
that the object appeared to be U-shaped but when he developed the negatives, the
object was V-shaped.

2. The objects that the professors observed were, in their opinion,
not bright enough to be photographed. This is, however, an estimate and could
be in error.

It was found that one school of thought of the people in the Lubbock
area was that the objects were some type of migratory birds reflection; it lit
from the city. Several people reported that they definitely knew the objects
were birds because they could see "large flapping". It is very possible that
some of the people who were looking for the object still see traces as there were
duck flights passing over during the period.

The college professors do not believe the theory that the objects were
birds, but they are living possibility more doubtful. If they were birds,
they would have to be relatively low to fly over the Lubbock area. An
occasional flight of birds might pass low over a city on a clear night but it is
highly doubtful if they would continue to do this for several nights. Migratory
birds usually try to keep away from cities.

The Federal "Aid Life Care" area was visited at Muleshoe. He was not
familiar with the incident he would if the objects were birds. He stated
that they could have been, however. The most likely suspect, if it is a bird,
is a member of the Plover family which has a pure white breast, but unless there
was a sudden influx of the bird into the Lubbock area, the reason would be
if there would be enough of these birds to make up as many flights as were
observed.

If the photos are authentic, the objects very probably are not ducks
because an experienced photo man from the Lubbock Air Base Maintenance attempted
to get photos of ducks using both natural light and flash, but failed.

B. Analysis of Photos by Wright Air Development Center

The Photographic Reconnaissance Laboratory of WADC made a preliminary
analysis of the photographs. The analysis was made by inspecting the negatives
in a comparator microscope. Their conclusions were:

UNCLASSIFIED


- page 28 -

CONFIDENTIAL (crossed out)

1. The images on the negatives were caused by light striking unexposed film, (i.e., the negatives were not retouched).

2. The individual lights in the "formation" varied in intensity.

3. The intensity was greater than any surrounding stars as the stars did not register. (The photos were taken under CAVU conditions.)

4. The individual lights changed position in the "formation".

C. Reinterrogation of the Photographer

The OSI was requested to reinterrogate the photographer in another attempt to determine the authenticity of the photographs. The details of this reinterrogation have not been received but a preliminary report stated that there were no indications that the photographs were not authentic.

D. Future Investigations

A trio to Lubbock, Texas, will be made during January. Arrangements are being made to have a Project Guide consultant and a physicist accompany Project during personnel. If the photographs are authentic, they are important in that:

1. They will give an accurate measurement of the angular span.

2. The light source, although it appeared to be of low intensity to the eye, was highly actinic.

3. The movement of the individual lights in the formation can be studied further.

4. Density comparison tests can be made.

LUBBOCK, TEXAS
25 August 1951

On the evenings of 25 August 1951, 31 August 1951, and 1 September 1951, flights of unidentified objects were observed over Lubbock, Texas; in some instances there were several flights per evening. The description of the objects varied to some extent, but it is generally agreed that it was a "V" or "U" shaped set of light-like objects. Mr. McCoy, an amateur photographer, turned over photographs to the Air Force which he claims are of two of the flights. Disagreement among the witnesses is on the number of lights in the arrangement, and whether it was "V" or "U" shaped. The flight path was from NE to SW or N-S. The object appeared brighter than stars and had a yellow or blue tint. In most cases no noise was reported, but a few witnesses stated they heard a "whoosh."

Many witnesses reported the incident, but the most technically competent observers were probably Professor [redacted], Head of [redacted], Professor of [redacted], and Dr. [redacted], Professor of [redacted] at Texas Tech. In addition to being the most competent, these witnesses were among the first to see the object and viewed it on subsequent occasions under controlled circumstances. For their initial sightings the professors were gathered together at a dormitory on the evening of 25 August 1951. At 2110 they happened to observe the first flight of the object, which they described as a rough semicircle of lights. A second object passed over the minutes later. The witnesses estimated the angular velocity to be 30° per second. During subsequent observations the professors confirmed their estimate of the velocity by using photographic and stop watches. Attempts were also made to get an estimate of the elevation by viewing the object from several locations at the same time and using trigonometric methods, and also by using clouds of known height. These attempts were not considered successful.

In 1959 Dr J Allen Hynek contacted one of the professors at Texas Tech regarding this case. This professor informed Dr Hynek that he had conducted an extensive study of the Lubbock sighting and determined that they were definitely birds.

The Air Force conclusion is that birds, with street lights reflecting from them, were the probable cause of this sighting. The angular velocity of 30° per second seems rather high for birds during migratory flights (approximately 60 MPH at 168 feet altitude). It is probable that the angular velocity was less. In all instances the witnesses were located in an area where their eyes were probably dark adapted, therefore making the objects appear brighter.

Mr. [redacted], when taking his pictures, had to do so by "panning" his camera (swinging with the object's motion). Panning is quite difficult and the relatively high degree of success of this photographer is further indication that the angular velocity of the object was not as high as estimated.

The kind of birds responsible for this sighting is not known, but it is highly probable that they were ducks or plovers. Since plovers do not usually fly in formations of more than six or seven, ducks became the more probable. The fact that this was late summer, and that the objects consistently flew to the south tends to substantiate the conclusion that the objects of this sighting were migratory birds.

CASE #

25 Aug 51                                          Lubbock, Texas

The bulk of the following information is taken from photostatic copies of articles from the Lubbock, Texas, Avalanche Journal, dated 26 August 1951, 28 August 1951, 1 September 1951, 2 September 1951 and 5 September 1951. The contents of these articles have been investigated and verified by the O.S.I. and Reece AFB officials.

On the evening of 25 August 1951, 31 August 1951 and 1 September 1951, flights of an unidentified object were observed over Lubbock, Texas, in some instances there were several flights per evening. The description of the objects varies to some extent but it is generally agreed that it is a V or U shaped set of lights. Photos were obtained of 2 such flights. The photographer has been investigated and appears reliable. Disagreement on the description of the object is in the number of lights, which varies from 50 to 18, and whether it was a V or U shape. The flight path was NE to SW or N to S. They were brighter than stars and yellowish or blue. In most cases there was an absence of noise, a few people heard a slight "whooah".

The incident has aroused the populace of Lubbock and two theories have arisen. One is that it is an aircraft; the other is that it is light reflecting off some type of migratory fowl.

Three college professors were gathered together discussing astronomy on the evening of 25 August 1951. They happened to be looking at a certain constellation when they observed the first flight at 2110. They described it as a rough semi-circle of lights. A second object passed over 3 minutes later. The men observed that there was no shock wave felt and they surmised that the object or objects must be above 50,000'. (Comment: NO shock or compression wave is felt due to high horizontal flights except at very low altitudes.) They could not judge the exact altitude or speed but agreed the speed was very high.

LUBBOCK, TEXAS, INCIDENT

The bulk of the following information is taken from photostatic copies of article from the Lubbock, Texas, Avalanche Journal, dates 26 August 1951, 28 August 1951, 1 September 1951, 2 September 1951, and 5 September 1951. The contents of these articles have been investigated and verified by the O.S.I. and Reece AFB officials.

On the evening of 25 August 1951, 31 August 1951, and 1 September 1951, flights of an unidentified object were observed over Lubbock, Texas, in some instances there were several flights per evening. The description of the objects varies to some extent but it is generally agreed that it is a V or U-shaped set of lights. Photos were obtained of two such flights. (See enclosure A.)

The photographer, Mr. [redacted] has been investigated and appears reliable.

Disagreement on the description of the object is in the number of lights, which varies from 50 to 18, and whether it was a V or U-shape. The flight path was NE to SW or N to S. They were brighter than stars and yellowish or blue. In most cases there was an absence of noise, a few people heard a slight "whoosh".

The incident has aroused the populace of Lubbock and two theories have arisen. One is that it is an aircraft; the other is that it is light reflecting off some type of migratory fowl.

A large number of people have witnessed the incident. The ones who have been named in reports are listed in enclosure #2, but many other unnamed people observed the incident on various nights. Probably the most technically competent observers were:

a. [redacted], Professor and Head of Petroleum Engineering Department at Texas Tech.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

b. Dr. [redacted] Professor of Chemical Engineering at Texas Tech.

c. Dr. [redacted] Professor of Geology at Texas Tech.

The above named observers have witnessed flights on several nights. They do not believe the bird theory, and stated that they have witnessed enough of the phenomena, or whatever it is, to make this decision. It is apparent from the information received by ATIC that this group attempted to approach the situation in a scientific manner.

The three college professors were gathered together discussing astronomy on the evening of 25 August 1951. They happened to be looking at a certain constellation when they observed the first flight at 2110. They described it as a rough semi-circle of lights. A second object passed over 3 minutes later. The men observed that there was no shock wave felt and they surmised that the object or objects must be above 50,000'. (Comment: No shock or compression wave is felt due to high horizontal flights except at very low altitudes.) They could not judge the exact altitude or speed but agreed the speed was very high.

The 5 September 1951 sighting was observed by a group of people with scientific backgrounds from the Texas Tech faculty. The group was unnamed but included six men with PhD degrees. They observed three flights and supposedly made measurements. Their counter to the migratory fowl theory is that:

a. There would not be enough light from reflections to obtain photographs of a bird in flight at night. (Comment: Substantiated by the Photo Section of HADC.)

b. The speed is too great, a 120° arc in 3 seconds (See inclosure #3).

c. The object was sighted by Big Spring Texas Airport Officials from the airport, which was not lighted, so there could be no light to reflect.

d. In regard to the 120° arc, one flight was observed over a cloud that

was at 2000'. The professors calculated that if the object were at 2000',
the speed would be greater than 600/mph. (Comment: About 1000 mph)

Incidents that are possibly related to the Lubbock sightings were
observed on 25 August 1951 and 31 August 1951.

On 25 August at 2158 MST, Mr. and Mrs. of Albuquerque,
New Mexico, sighted a "flying wing" type aircraft about 1 1/2 times the size
of a B-36 over Albuquerque. The wings were swept back approximately 15 degrees
and they noticed "soft glowing lights" on the trailing edge of the wing. There
was no sound. It appeared to be going generally N to S. Mr. is con-
sidered by O.S.I. to be completely reliable. The possibility of aircraft
in area was checked and is negative.

At 1245 CST, Mrs. and her daughter, Mrs. were
driving their automobile a few miles north of Matador, Texas. Mrs.
and then Mrs. observed an object drifting slowly in an easterly
direction. (Comment: Wind was ENE at 3 knots making the object go into
the wing.) The object was about 150' altitude and 200' in front of the
automobile. It was pear-shaped and judged to be 150' high, 40' wide and
18' long. The ladies stopped the car and got out. The object was pear-
shaped, aluminum or silver in color, with a window or part. It ascended
rapidly, small end up, with a circular motion. There was no smoke or sound.
Mrs. Tilson has been checked by O.S.I. and appears to be reliable.

On 26 August 1951 another incident occurred which although not being
in the Texas - New Mexico area may have a bearing on the incident. At 0826
PST (0636 OST) a ground radar type All/CPS-1 and an All/CPS-4 picked up a fast
moving target. The target was observed twice for a few seconds. The object

was plotted at 13,000' making a ground speed of 948 mph. The signals, however, were weak and their true identity was doubtful. The operator, an AF Captain, has had a great deal of experience and is completely reliable. The F-86's were scrambled by radar last contact before the fighters were airborne. They made a visual search with no success. The weather did not favor anomalous propagation.

LUBBOCK, TEXAS - 25 August 1951                Status Report #1

The first of a series of sightings related to this incident occurred the evening of 25 August 1951 at approximately 110 CST. Four Texas Technical College professors were sitting in the backyard of one of the professors' homes observing meteors in conjunction with a study of micrometeorites being carried out by the college. At 110 they observe a group of lights pass overhead from N to S. The lights had about the same intensity as a bright star but were larger in area. The altitude was not determined but they traveled at a high rate of speed. The pattern of the lights was almost a perfect semicircle containing from 20 to 30 individual lights. Later in the evening a similar incident was observed and during a period of about three weeks a total of approximately twelve (12) such flights were observed by these men.

The group of men included:
a. The Head of the [blacked out] Department
b. Professor of [blacked out], has Ph.D.
c. Professor of [blacked out], has Ph.D.
d. Professor of [blacked out], has Ph.D.

Besides the above four men the following have observed the incidents:
a. Professor of [blacked out], has Ph.D.
b. Graduate student working on Ph.D.

In addition, a Professor of Astronomy was consulted on the incident, but he did not observe any of these flights.

The above mentioned men took a personal interest in the phenomena and undertook a study of the objects. Attempts were made to obtain an altitude measurement by laying out a measured base line perpendicular to the usual flight path of the object and placing angle measuring devices at the end of the base line, however, all their attempts failed because the objects did not appear on the night's the observers were waiting for them.

From the series of observations, the following facts were obtained:
a. The angular velocity of the object was very nearly 300 of arc per second.
b. There was no sound that could be attributed to the object.
c. The flight path of the object was from N to S in the majority of the flights.
d. There were two or three flights per evening.
e. The period between flights was about one hour and 10 minutes.

I.   When seen clearly, object was circular, whether like a plane or like
a ball couldn't be told. We think it was probably flat because we
could only see thin line. The object was moving vertically and
could be seen. It was at all times surrounded by a haze of brownish-
black smoke. When it moved, the haze trailed behind.

II.  When it moved, its movements were violent; at times stopped at a high
speed, stopped suddenly when it did stop, at times became very hard
to see. Although no sound was heard a person would have heard even
a spluttering-muffled plane at this distance. At times it seemed the
plane could have done the maneuvers it did at the speed at which it
seemed to be traveling.

III. From the top of the 50 ft. silo on which we were standing it moved
to be about 5 to 10 miles away, (about 3 miles southwest of Orange,
Va.) over a small mountain. It stayed in an area of about 1 square
mile. From Sept. 20 about 3 p.m.

The three who saw it were: W. Daniel, Jr., Frank Miller, Jr.,
15 and Peter Shilling, 17. We have written what we saw, and
saw, and what we have written above is exactly what saw.

f. The color of the light was blue-white.

g. There were from 20 to 30 separate lights in each formation.

h. The first two flights observed were a semi-circle of lights but in subsequent flights there was no orderly arrangement.

i. The object always appeared at an angle of about 50° from horizontal in the north and disappeared at about 60° in the south. The object did not gradually come into view as would an aircraft approaching from a distance, neither did it actually disappear.

j. There was no apparent change in size as the object passed overhead.

Attempts were made to obtain the relative height of the object in respect to clouds. However, these attempts were also unsuccessful due to the fact that the object passed between widely scattered clouds.

Efforts to determine whether or not there was any form between the lights by trying to see stars between the lights were made. This also was unsuccessful due to the short time the object was in view.

This phenomena was observed by at least one hundred people in and around Lubbock, Texas. Some of these people were of the opinion that the objects were birds.

On the evening of 31 August 1951, at about 2230 CST, a college freshmen from Texas Tech observed three flights of the object and allegedly obtained five photographs. He obtained two photos of one flight, three of another. These photos show single rows of light in V-formation on two photos and a whole row on the others. His description of the object in much the same as that of the college professor, except that the college professor never observed a perfect V-formation.

(See Appendix II and V for possibly related incidents.)

Status of the Investigation

Project Grudge personnel made a trip to Lubbock, Texas, on 6-9 November 1951 to obtain more details on the incident. Many sources who had seen the object or who were involved in the sighting were interviewed. A conference was held with the college professors and they offered to write a detailed account of their observations and forward it to ATIC. This report should be forthcoming.

The photographer who claims to have photographed the object was interrogated. Very effort was made to find a flaw in the photographer's account of the incident but the results were negative. While college professors did not believe the photographs were actually of the object, however, they did not observe the same objects that were photographed. Since the interrogation, two


- page 43 -

UNCLASSIFIED

discrepancies in the photos have been found and the photographer is being reinterrogated by the O.S.I.

One school of thought of the people in the Millbrook area is that the objects were some of the military high velocity light from the city. Several people thought that they could see wings flapping. It is very possible that some of the people who were looking for the object did not see what was there and those people who saw trucks were definitely able to identify the objects as trucks, or some type of dirt, because they said see that it is near. It is more, however, possible that some people did not see any life.

The college professors do not believe the theory that the objects were birds, but they are giving the possibility more thought. If they were birds, they would have to be relatively low to the ground. An occasional flight of birds might pass low over a city on a clear night but it is highly doubtful if they would continue to do this for several nights. Migratory birds usually try to keep away from cities.

The Federal Hill Iris agent was visited and at lunch he was not familiar with the incident to could not give much light. He stated that they could have been, however. The most likely suspect, if it is a bird, is a member of the Plover family this: has a sure white breast, but unless there was a sudden influx of the birds into the Millbrook area, he was warden doubted if there would be enough of these birds to make up as many flights as were observed.

If the photos are authentic, the objects were probably not ducks because an experienced photographer has from the Millbrook aviatonic experience attended to put photos using both natural light and flash, but failed.

The investigation of this incident is continuing. It is probably the most unique incident in the history of project crude in that it was observed so many times by a scientifically trained group of observers. These people are continuing to attempt to arrive at a solution for the phenomena. They had previously lost interest after several weeks of observations because they believed that the object was some new Air Force aircraft or missile.

The photographs are now at the Photographic Reconnaissance Laboratory at Wright Air Development Center for analysis.

LUBBOCK, TEXAS - 25 August 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF THE INCIDENT

The first of a series of sightings related to this incident occurred the evening of 25 August 1951 at approximately 2110 CST. Four Texas Technical College professors were sitting in the backyard of one o' the professors' homes observing meteorites in conjunction with a study of micrometeories being carried out by the college. At 2130 they observed a group of lights pass overhead from N to S. The lights had about the same intensity as high cirrus clouds on a moonlight night. The altitude was not determined but they traveled at a high rate of speed. The pattern of the lights was almost a perfect semi-circle containing from 20 to 30 individual lights. Later in the evening a similar incident was observed and during a period of about three weeks a total of approximately twelve (12) such flights were observed by these men.

The group of men included:
a. The Head of the [redacted] Department
b. Professor of [redacted], has PhD.
c. Professor of [redacted], has PhD.
d. Professor of [redacted], has PhD.

Besides the above four men, the following have observed the incidents:
a. Professor of [redacted], has PhD.
b. Graduate student working on PhD.

In addition, a Professor of Astronomy was consulted on the incident, but he did not observe any of these flights.

The above mentioned men took a personal interest in the phenomena and undertook a study of the objects. Attempts were made to obtain an altitude measurement by laying out a measured base line perpendicular to the usual flight path of the object and placing angle measuring devices at the end of the base line, however, all their attempts failed because the objects did not appear on the nights the observers were waiting for them.

From the series of observations, the following facts were obtained:
a. The angular velocity of the object was very nearly 30° of arc per second.
b. There was no sound that could be attributed to the object.
c. The flight path of the object was from N to S in the majority of the flights although some were NE to SW.
d. On several nights there were two or three flights.

e. The color of the lights was blue-green.

f. There were from 15 to 30 separate lights in each formation.

g. The first two flights observed were a semi-circle of lights but in subsequent flights there was no orderly arrangement.

h. The object always appeared at an angle of about 45° from horizontal in the north and disappeared at about 45° in the south. The object did not fractually come into view as would an aircraft approaching from a distance, neither did it gradually disappear.

i. There was no apparent change in size as the object passed overhead.

j. The "angular span" was estimated to be 10°.

Attempts were made to obtain the relative height of the object in respect to clouds. However, these attempts were also unsuccessful due to the fact that the objects passed between widely scattered clouds.

Attempts were made to determine whether or not there was any form between the lights by trying to see star between the lights. These also were unsuccessful to the short time the object was in view.

This phenomena was observed by at least one hundred people in and around Lubbock, Texas. Some of these people were of the opinion that the objects were Idris reflecting lights from the city.

On the evening of 31 August 1951 at about 2230 CST, a college freshman from Texas Tech observed a flight of the unidentified objects pass over his home. The flight was observed through an open window. Upon observing the first flight of the objects, the observer obtained his camera and went into his backyard of his home in an attempt to get photographs of additional flights of the objects. (Comment: this would be logical as by 31 August 1951 these flights of the objects were known.) Two more flights of the object allegedly did occur and were photographed. Two photos of one flight and three of another were obtained. After four of the negatives but the other one was lost or misplaced by the photographer. The photographs show a V-shaped formation of lights. In one photo a single V of lights appear, while on three photos there is a double V. The separate lights, which appear to be pinpoint light sources, vary in intensity.

A. Trip to Lubbock, Texas

A trip was made to Lubbock, Texas, on 6-9 November 1951 to obtain more details on the incident. Many people who had seen the object or who were involved in the incident were interrogated. A conference was held with the college professors and they prepared a signed statement describing the objects they observed.

1. The images on the negatives were caused by light striking unexposed film, (i.e., the negatives were not retouched).

2. The individual lights in the "formation" varied in intensity.

3. The intensity was greater than any surrounding stars as the stars did not register. (The photos were taken under CAVU conditions.)

4. The individual lights changed position in the "formation".

C. Reinterrogation of the Photographer

The OSI was requested to reinterrogate the photographer in another attempt to determine the authenticity of the photographs. The details of this reinterrogation have not been received but a preliminary report stated that there were no indications that the photographs were not authentic.

D. Future Investigations

A trip to Lubbock, Texas, will be made during January. Arrangements are being made to have a Project Grudge personnel and a physicist accompany Project Grudge personnel. If the photographs are authentic, they are important in that:

1. They will give an accurate measurement of the angular span.

2. The light source, although it appeared to be of low intensity to the eye, was highly actinic.

3. The movement of the individual lights in the formation can be studied further.

4. Density comparison tests can be made.

LUBBOCK, TEXAS, AUG 27 — TWO STRANGE FORMATIONS LIKE "STRINGS OF BEADS" IN CRESCENT SHAPE" HURTLED THROUGH THE SKY OVER LUBBOCK AT A SPEED WHICH CARRIED THEM FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON IN THREE SECONDS, THREE TEXAS TECH COLLEGE PROFESSORS SAID TODAY. THE WEIRD FORMATIONS WERE REPORTED BY W. L. DUCKER, HEAD OF THE TECH PETROLEUM ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, WHO SAID "IF I HAIN'T HAD CONFIRMING WITNESSES PRESENT, I PECT SURE I WOULD HAVE SAID NOTHING ABOUT WHAT I SAW."

DUCKER SAID HE AND DR. A. G. BERRY, PROFESSOR OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, WERE RELAXING AT THE HOME OF DR. W. I. ROBINSON, GEOLOGY PROFESSOR, SATURDAY NIGHT, WHEN THE "STRING OF BEADS" WHIPPED ACROSS THE HEAVENS.

"WE FELT NO SHOCK WAVES, SUCH AS AN OBJECT MOVING AT SUCH HIGH SPEEDS IN THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE WOULD GIVE OFF," DUCKER SAID, "AND THE ABSENCE OF SUCH WAVES WOULD INDICATE THE FORMATION WAS FLYING IN THE STRATOSPHERE, 50,000 FEET ABOVE THE EARTH OR HIGHER."

THE THREE PROFESSORS AGREED THAT PASSAGE OF THE OBJECTS ACROSS THE ARC OF THE SKY REQUIRED ABOUT THREE SECONDS. WITH THAT TIME BASIS, DUCKER SAID, "WE FIGURED THE SPEED MUST HAVE BEEN 1,800 MILES PER HOUR IF THE OBJECTS WERE A MILE HIGH."

IF THEY WERE AT 50,000 FEET, DUCKER SAID, THE SPEED MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT 13,000 MILES PER HOUR.

THE PROFESSORS SAID THEY COULD NOT DETERMINE SHAPE OF THE OBJECTS BECAUSE OF THE SPEED, BUT THAT EACH GAVE OFF A GLOW OF REFLECTED LIGHT.

AUTHORITIES AT REESE AIR FORCE BASE NEAR HERE SAID NO JET PLANES WERE IN THE AREA AT TIME OF THE SIGHTING. THERE APPEARED TO BE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES TO THE PHENOMENON.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Objects in Flight over Lubbock, Texas

Stated that they saw off a glow which could have been created from the lights of the city below. The formation of objects allegedly crossed the sky from horizon to horizon in three seconds. Calculations made by these professors were to the effect that had the formation of objects been flying at an altitude of one mile from earth, their speed would have been 1800 miles an hour, or at 50,000 feet of altitude, their speed would have been nearer 18,000 miles per hour.

We shock waves were felt, according to Mr. [redacted], who stated that in the absence of shock waves would indicate that the formation was flying in the stratosphere, above 50,000 feet. Dr. [redacted] estimated that there were 50 of the strange objects. A second group of such objects allegedly passed over the sky approximately three minutes later. One [redacted] of the Journalism Department at Texas Technological College, also reported that several nights prior to the observations of Professors [redacted] he had observed a similar flight of objects over Lubbock, Texas, and described them in a similar manner as did the three professors. On Monday, 27 August 1951, according to news sources, four additional witnesses verified the reports of the three professors from the college at Lubbock.

These persons were: Mr. [redacted] and Professor [redacted] and Professor associate professor of German at Texas Technological College. These four witnesses allegedly verified the time of the reported incident as being 2110 hours CST.

On 30 August 1951, one [redacted] of Lubbock, Texas, snapped photographs of what was purported to be the unidentified objects in flight over Lubbock, Texas. These photographs showed the unidentified objects in a rough V-formation. A second photograph made by Mr. [redacted] shows the objects having shifted into a single line formation, maintaining however the original V-shape. Advised that he had shot the photographs with a 35 mm. camera. No other information was available as to exposure, type of film, or other technical data. Between 2040 and 2257 hours CST, 31 August 1951, similar calls were reportedly received over Lubbock by the editorial office of the Lubbock Morning Avalanche. In which various persons allegedly sighting of the strange objects. All reports, according to the news source, describe the objects as flying in V-shaped or U-shaped formation passing directly overhead through the sky within three to seven seconds. The number of such objects ranged from eight or nine to 20 or 30°. The course of flight of the objects on 30 and 31 August 1951, was allegedly a general direction from north to south.

The objects were variously described as being the color of stars, or shades of blue or yellow.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Objects in Flight over Lubbock, Texas

At Matador, Texas, two women, Mrs. [redacted] and her daughter, Mrs. [redacted] were alleged to have observed a "wingless" type object traveling at a low altitude and at a low speed. This craft allegedly passed within 150 feet of hrs. [redacted] automobile, then rose rapidly and was out of sight within a few minutes. Mrs. [redacted] were all agreed to have reported being near enough to the unidentified object to observe one door or porthole in the metal side of the aircraft. Since the initial sighting of the alleged object, many reports similar in nature have been received by the editorial offices of the Lubbock Avalanche Journal, and according to this news source, speculation as to the nature of the phenomenon apparently is causing numerous other reported sightings.

1. Investigation predicated upon verbal request from Air Provost Marshal and Base Intelligence Officer, Reese Air Force Base, Texas, 17 September 1951, based upon receipt of classified "JCK" from Commanding General, Air Material Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio, relayed via Commanding Officer, Reese AFB, by District Commencing, 23rd OSI District, dated 15 September 1951. Telephone contact was made with General, Air Material Command as prescribed in AR Regulation 200-15, pertaining to the sighting of Unidentified Objects in Lubbock, Texas. These incidents were previously reported to Headquarters SAT by District Office No. 23, Cardwell AFB, Texas, in Spot Intelligence Report, dated 7 September 1951, Subject: Unidentified Objects in Flight over Lubbock, Texas.

AT REESE AFB, TEXAS

2. 1st Lt JOHN A. FARLEY, Assistant Wing Intelligence Officer, Reese AFB, was designated to accompany the report desired by the Commanding General, Air Material Command and requested any possible assistance from the Office of Special Investigations in the furtherance of the mission.

AT LUBBOCK, TEXAS

3. On 17 September 1951, the writer accompanied by FARLEY met with the editor of the Avalanche Journal newspaper of Lubbock, Texas, Mr. CHARLES GUY, who, without any questions, assisted in obtaining available copies of the paper containing the necessary information to thoroughly acquaint FARLEY with the scope of the required investigation. Those copies of the newspaper were subsequently photographed in primary.

AT REESE AFB, TEXAS

4. Due to the classification of SECRET imposed by the Commanding General, Air Material Command, as mentioned TDK and the same classification held by AF Regulation 200-15, few the preparation of the A-2 report all of the newspaper items were photographed, developed and printed in five (5) copies only, using one (1) negative for each reproduction.

by a Mrs. [redacted] who resides on a small ranch five miles north of
Latador, Texas on U. S. Highway 70. This incident was reprinted in
the Lubbock Morning Avalanche, 1 September 1951, under the "Saucer
heading of 31 August 1951. (See Inclosure No. 4)

6. At 1205 hours, 28 September 1951, accompanied by Lt TALLEY,
the writer interviewed Mrs. [redacted] who resided at approximately
125½ hours (CST) 31 August 1951, as she and her daughter, Mrs. [redacted]
of Lamesa, Oklahoma, who was visiting at home, were driving on
the U. S. Highway 70, located about five miles north of Matador, Texas, on
U. S. Highway 70, their attention was attracted by a strange aerial
object drifting across U. S. Highway 70. Mrs. [redacted] who was driving,
first noticed the object and it was apparently a few seconds before she
drew her attention to it. [redacted] stated that when she saw
the object, it was drifting slowly in an easterly direction about 150
feet above the terrain and approximately 200 feet in front of their
car. About the time [redacted] saw the object, it began a rapid ascent and
moved away in a few seconds to the east in a circular ascent.

The object was described by [redacted] as being pear shaped in
appearance, (to quote "like a yellow pear shaped tomato") eliminating or
silhouetting in color, and that the object readily reflected the sunlight.
The object had a port, window, door or a similar aperture, located at
a point where the object began to taper towards the small end. One
object only was seen, and it moved through the air with the small and
forward. She stated the sun was shining brightly with little or no
wind.

Mrs. [redacted] stopped the car and got out and both then realized
there was no noise, no sign of exhaust, no smoke, no wing vents visible,
nor was any visible means of propulsion observed. [redacted] stated she could
not estimate the speed of the object except that it went up rapidly in
a curving angle east and in a few seconds was out of her sight. She
did not get out of the car and lost sight of the object as it ascended
due to her limited vision inside the car. [redacted] was certain the object
was not a balloon. She compared the size of the object, to the west
of her knowledge, as comparable to the Matador valley freight shed or
perhaps larger. The Matador Freight Shed was examined and measured
opportunely 48 feet by 16 feet.

Mrs. [redacted] stated she had judged the height of the object just above ground to have been approximately 150 feet by comparison
with "Bob's Oil Well", a well known landmark, which is an oil derrick
combined with a gasoline filling station located in the city limits of
Matador, on U. S. Highway 70. To her knowledge, no other persons
observed the object.

7. An examination of the location described by [REDACTED] was made, and it was observed that the terrain to the west of U.S. Highway 70 is rolling land for about 10 to 12 miles (east) to a line of foothills. The land is sparsely to moderately heavily wooded by mesquite with the first 500 yards open flat terrain. The land to the east is fairly flat for approximately 20 to 30 miles, sparsely wooded and the first 1000 to 1200 yards is open terrain. Inquiry was made at "Bob's Oil Well" gas station and disclosed that the derrick is 38 feet in height with an advertising sign on top of approximately 22 feet, or a total overall height of 120 feet.

AT LUBBOCK, TEXAS

11. The sighting of unidentified objects and the subsequent pictures taken of these objects in formation at Lubbock, Texas by [redacted], Lubbock, Texas, a college freshman, appeared in the Morning Avalanche newspaper of 1 September 1951. (See Inclosure No. 3)

12. At 1945 hours, 20 September 1951, [redacted] at his residence by the writer and Lt. [redacted] stated that on the night of 30 August 1951, about 2330 hours (CST) he was lying in bed watching the stars and noticed a "swastika or unidentified aerial object" passing over the house. Taking a camera "bug", he secured his camera, a 35 mm Kodak equipped with a range finder and went into the back yard. At about 2332 hours he saw a second formation of the same type objects passing overhead and took two (2) pictures, enclosed as Inclosure No. 7 and 3. Almost at once, at about 2333 hours, the third formation passed over and obtained three (3) more pictures. Two (2) are included as Inclosure No. 9 and 10. He was unable to locate the other negative but stated it was almost identical to Inclosure No. 2. The second formation looked "as big as an object", great height and passed from sight within a space of two three (3) to four (4) seconds.

AGENT'S NOTE: The view in the back yard is restricted, a line of trees ob scuring vision to the north and the house preventing vis on to the south.

13. [redacted] could not estimate the altitude but stated that all formations looked as if they were approximately the same high altitude. The objects had a brilliant 1170 surface light but did not glitter. Each object looked like a white stick or a rapidly moving light, white in color, did not twinkle like a star but rather had a glow comparable to a neon. [redacted] stated that contained 18 or 20 objects and traveled in a U or rough V formation. [redacted] stated that the first group looked like a single line formation, the second and third groups as the first.

AGENT'S NOTE: Development of the negatives obtained from [redacted] shows (negative #5, see Inclosure No. 7) is a double line formation to Inclosure No. 8 and No. 9 (negative #5 and #7) however, Inclosure No. 10 is a single line.

The negatives were turned over to the Reese AFB Assistant Intelligence Officer, 1st Lt JOHN FARLEY for inclusion in his report as requested by the Commanding General, Air Materiel Command.

14. According to the objects in the formation kept shifting position but he was not too certain of that fact. Was emphatic in his assertion that there was no noise, no exhaust, no flames, or any visual means of propulsion within his scope of sight or hearing. He could make no approximation of the size of the objects due to the great altitude.

15. The weather was clear with very little wind. The Lubbock, Texas weather observation at 2330 hours for 30 August 1951, was listed as: Thin scattered clouds at 28,000 feet, visibility 15 miles plus, temperature 78 degrees, dew point 56 degrees, with wind from the south southeast at six MPH.

16. On 1 September 1951, he saw two more formations pass over Lubbock, approximate time 2320 hours, with about a two minute interval between the formations. He did not get any photographs of these formations, but said the weather was clear, except that the objects seemed to be at a much greater altitude and although the formations passed over Lubbock in about the same position as before, the course seemed to be from the northwest to the southeast. Each group looked to be a single line formation.

17. The Lubbock, Texas weather observation at 2330 hours, 1 September 1951 was: Clear, visibility 15 miles plus, temperature 77 degrees, dew point 61 degrees, wind from the southeast at six MPH.

18. Photographic equipment was checked by the writer, and information was obtained relative to the photographs taken on 30 August 1951.

I. When seen clearly, object was circular, whether like a plate or like a ball could not be told. We think it was probably flat because at times only a thin line, sometimes horizontal, sometimes vertical could be seen. It was at all times surrounded by a haze of brownish-black smoke. When it moved the haze trailed behind.

II. When it moved, its movements were violent and it traveled at a high speed, stopped suddenly when it did stop, at times became very hard to see.

BY TECH GRO -
Strange Objects
Seen Over City

MYSTERIOUS objects—two or three of them appearing "as a string of beads" and moving "at an incredible speed"—were sighted in the night sky over Lubbock Saturday

But this time instead of being watched by a casual observer, the objects were watched by three cool, calculating persons trained in scientific fields—three Texas Tech faculty members.

The first group of objects flying in a rough semi-circle, or crescent formation, was sighted at 9:10 p.m. by W. L. Ducker, Tech professor and head of the Petroleum Engineering department; Dr. A. G. Oberg, professor of chemical engineering; and Dr. W. I. Robinson, professor of geology at Tech.

The second group was holding an informal packaging meeting at Dr. Robinson's home, 2612 Move At High Speed

Ducker, speaking for the group, said the objects appeared as a "string of beads" racing in the crescent formation from the northeast to southwest at "incredible speed."

The individual objects which made up the formation were minute, Ducker said, but gave off a glow, apparently reflected light, possibly from the city below.

The three Tech professors were unable to give the size, but Ducker said, each calculated the formation covered the sky in 10 to 15 seconds.

Other calculation showed that the formation was traveling at a mile altitude at approximately 1,600 miles an hour, or if at 50,000 feet altitude, the speed would be nearer 18,000 miles an hour.

Strange Objects (Continued From Page One)

They also estimated from the apparent size of the objects, that if they were flying a mile high, each object was approximately 1,000 feet in diameter.

"We felt no shock waves such as an object traveling at such a high speed in the lower atmosphere would give off," Ducker said, "and the absence of such shock waves would indicate that the formation was flying in the stratosphere, 50,000 feet or higher."

Dr. Oberg pointed out that the group was seated in chairs scanning the skies for meteors following a discussion of stars and planets, when Ducker happened to spot the approaching objects.

Dr. Oberg estimated there were 40 objects in each formation, "extremely difficult to get an accurate estimate."

Spot Second Group

Ducker said the second group, containing about the same number of individual objects, and moving in the same semi-circular formation, with the bulge toward the line of flight, speed overhead about three minutes later giving the three men an opportunity to check their first observations.

"Frankly, we were astonished. And if I had not had confirming witnesses at the time I feel sure I should have said nothing about what I saw," Ducker said. "For it is incredible to believe they are of terrestrial origin and even they are from beyond the earth."

Ducker pointed out that while the three professors met frequently for discussions at "no time was anything stronger than ice tea" served, and on this particular occasion "Dr. Robinson forgot to provide ice tea."

The Civil Aeronautics administration office at Municipal airport said that no jet planes, or other flights were passing over Lubbock at the time Ducker and his companions sighted the two formations. RAFS also said no flights were in the area.

J. Russell Heitman, head of the Tech Journalism department, several nights ago also reported seeing a flight of objects flying over Lubbock, and described them in a manner similar to those seen Saturday night.

"Operations Beads" was confirmed Monday by four additional persons who say they saw the same mysterious flight racing through Lubbock skies Saturday night that was witnessed and previously reported by three members of the Texas Tech faculty.

The Techsans said they saw what appeared to be a group of objects in a semi-circular formation "like a string of beads" flying overhead at "incredible speed."

Monday, four new witnesses said they saw the same thing at the same time—9:10 p.m. Saturday. They were Mrs. Earl Medlock of 1912 Ave. N. Mrs. R. A. Rogers of 1910 Ave. N. and Mrs. F. A. Rogers of the same address, and Prof. Carl Henninger, 2311 Eleventh, Associate professor of German

The text includes discussions of potential explanations for the sightings, including birds, but suggests some witnesses believe the objects were something else entirely.

'Strange Aircraft'
Seen At Matador

MATADOR, Aug. 31.-(Special)--A "noiseless aircraft, flying at a low altitude without aid of propellors or wings," was reported seen early this afternoon by two Matador district women and a 5-year-old child.

Mrs. Tom Tilsom, her daughter Mrs. M. G. Bethard and little Noilene Bethard said they were driving on State Highway 70, one and one-half miles north of here about 12:45 p. m. when the wingless craft passed 150 feet in front of the car.

The slow-moving machine, "shaped somewhat like a helicopter," began circling as Mrs. Bethard stopped the car. As the craft rose it "gained speed and was out of sight within a few minutes."

The women were near enough to spot one door, or porthole, in the side of the gleaming metal, they said. When first seen, it was moving at the rate of a commercial airliner taking off, they said. It had no exhaust showing.

Mrs. Bethard, whose husband sailed for Korea recently, has lived near several Air Force bases, and reported the machine she saw today was different from any she had seen before.

THE "flying whatsits" continue merrily on their way -- but the argument goes on. And if a duck wearing a lighted miner's cap ever meets up with a man in a flying saucer, there's going to be quite a battle over who caused the most common over Lubbock and other South Plains towns.

Again last night, as has been the case almost every night recently, residents called in to report the mysterious objects.

Lubbock doesn't have a monopoly on the illuminated "things" which jumped into prominence when three Tech faculty members sighted a string of lights traveling from northeast to southwest over the horizon at an "incredible" speed" twelve days ago. A lot of such people, in Amarillo, Big Spring, 2,000 feet, the objects would have

Panhandle-South Plains points have sighted the objects since.

"The only thing is that those who 'see' birds' stick to that theory while many others -- including the Tech instructors and others highly reliable -- admit they are not birds definitely are not birds.

Last night, one of a group of scientific observers from the Texas Tech faculty announced that group had further substantiated its belief that the objects are not birds.

"There have been three flights tonight, and at last we observed one group passing above a cloud which gave us a more concrete idea of the altitude. Assuming that

Lubbock, Texas Trip Report
6-9 November 1951

On 6-9 November 1951, Lt. E. J. Ruppelt made a trip to Lubbock, Texas, in regard to a series of sightings of unidentified objects. The following contacts were made:

1. Mr. Charles Guy, Publisher of Lubbock Avalanche
2. [Redacted]
3. Photographer
4. Mr. Jay Harris, Newspaper Editor
5. Trip to Brownfield, Texas
6. Federal Wild Life Game Warden
7. Meeting with Texas Tech Professors

A more complete covering could have been made if air transportation could have been obtained.

No effort was made to interrogate sources in regard to the Matador Tech incident because of lack of time.

1. Mr. Charles Guy, Publisher of the Lubbock Avalanche

Lt Ruppelt, accompanied by Mr. of the Reese AFB Detachment of the OSI, met Mr. on the morning of 7 November 1951. Mr. was very helpful in confirming all the information given in the newspaper articles, enclosures to JSI report.

However, he was not directly connected with the stories so he suggested Mr. Jay Harris, Managing Editor of the Lubbock Morning Avalanche, be contacted. He arranged this contact for the evening of 7 November.

He also gave the following names of newspaper people in towns adjacent to Lubbock who might be able to furnish some additional information.

a. Lamesa, Texas, Reporter Bill Ray
b. Big Spring, Texas, The Herald, Editor Bill Whipkey
c. Brownfield, Texas, Brownfield News, Editor Jerry Stoltz

2. Prof. [redacted], Head of Petroleum Engineering
Department of Texas Technical College

On the afternoon of 7 November 1951, Lt Ruppelt of ATIC, Capt Parker, and Lt Farely of Wing Intelligence, Reese AFB, visited Prof. [redacted] at his office at Texas Tech.

The matter of the unidentified aerial objects were discussed for about an hour. Prof. [redacted] offered to arrange an evening meeting of several college professors who had observed the phenomena. The meeting was arranged for the evening of 8 November at 1930 at the home of Dr. [redacted].

No details of the interview with Prof. [redacted] will be given as they are all covered in the report of the meeting on the evening of 8 November at Dr. [redacted].

Here is the OCR text from the document:

3.

Mr. [redacted], was interviewed on the evening of 7 November 1951 at his home by Lt Ruppelt and Mr. H. N. Bossart of the Reese AFB OSI detachment.

(A description of Mr. [redacted] is given in OSI report.)

The purpose of the visit was to obtain further data on the photos taken by Mr. [redacted], and to attempt to determine the authenticity of the photos. Mr. [redacted] was again questioned as to the events leading up to taking the photos and how he took them. His story was identical to that given in.

In addition several other facts were obtained. Upon seeing the objects [redacted] rushed into the house and got his camera. He had experience in taking pictures at night as he had experimented with star shots. He realized that he would have to give the objects as much light as possible so he "opened it up", f 3.5 at 1/10 of a second, the "fastest" combination for a Kodak 35.

The object appeared at about 30° from the horizontal. [redacted] stated they appeared just over a tree top, and the angle was measured to be very close to 30° The direction was NNE. The objects went a little to his right and disappeared at about 30° from the horizontal at SSE. This gives an arc of very close to 120°. During this time he "panned" his camera. (i.e. followed the object with the camera.) During this process he took two pictures during each flight. The procedure was duplicated by Mr. [redacted] and timed. It took 4 seconds, timed by the sweep second hand on a wrist watch. This comes out to be 30° per second. (Note: This is the same time obtained by Prof. [redacted])

The interrogating officer, Lt. Ruppelt, has been an amateur photographer for 14 years and all the data and procedures given by [redacted] were accurate and very logical.

No progress was made in attempting to determine whether or not the photos were authentic.

were faked. story could not be "picked apart" because it was entirely logical. He was questioned on why he did certain things and his answers were all logical, concise, and without hesitation. He was visibly nervous but this could be due to the fact that he knew Mr. Bossartt was from OSI and Lt Ruppelt from W-P AFB. This nervousness at no time caused him to falter in his story.

stated that the object appeared to be about brighter than the brightest star in the sky. He compared it to Venus in the early evening.

4. Mr. Jay Harris, Managing Editor of the Lubbock Morning Avalanche and William Hams, Photographer

Mr. Bossartt of the RAFB Detachment of the OSI and Lt Ruppelt interviewed the Managing Editor of the Lubbock Morning Avalanche, Mr. Harris, on the evening of 7 November 1951.

Mr. Harris gave the following information before the interrogation began:

On the evening of 25 September 1951, he was at the news desk of the paper when a Prof. of Texas Tech College called him on the phone. Reported he had just seen an aerial phenomena that would be worth a story. He continued to tell about the "string of beads" that he and two other college professors had seen in the sky. Harris at first was not interested, then said he felt it was important and that by running the story they might be able to contact others who had seen the phenomena. Harris said o.k. if he could use [illegible] name. [Illegible] said he wasn't sure about this and ended the conversation. A few minutes later he called again and said that it would be o.k. to use his name and the names of Profs. [illegible] and [illegible] who were with him at the time and also saw it. It would first, however, have to be o.k.'d by the college public relations people. This was done and the story was printed on 26 August 1951.

No further reports came in until a few days later.

On Friday, 31 August 1951, a photographer who does work for the paper and is highly regarded by Mr. [illegible] called and said a young man (Mr. [illegible]) had just developed some negatives in his studio and he thought the paper might be interested in them. They advised [illegible] to bring them over which he did. Mr. [illegible] and his head photographer, Mr. [illegible] looked them over and were dubious

or not they were migratory fowl came up. Mr. Hams decided to try to get a picture himself so he stationed himself on top of the Lubbock Avalanche Building with a 4 x 5 Speed Graphic loaded with a tungsten ASA 80 film and a GE #22 flashbulb in a concentrating reflector. He normally uses this same equipment to photograph night football games. He can get a normal negative by shooting f 16, at 1/100 of a second and developing twice the normal time in DK-60 a developer. This night he sat on the roof and had his camera set at f 4.7 at 1/10 of a second. He waited some time and a flock of some type of birds flew over. They were visible in the light of the sodium vapor street lights used in Lubbock. He shot as the flock was overhead. He also stated that he knew they were birds before he took the picture because he could see them dimly outlined. They were in a ragged V-formation and silent, which is unusual for ducks or geese, if they were ducks or geese. He developed his negatives and found the image so weak he could not print them. On the next night he attempted the same thing using a Kodak Reflex at f 3.5 at 1/10 with Super XX film, a #22 bulb and the concentrating reflector; the results were the same. Mr. Hams assumed that with his experience he should know that he was in a position in the city to get a maximum of light on any birds flying over him. From this, he is convinced that whatever took a picture of was many times as bright as the birds he unsuccessfully attempted to photograph.

Mr. Hams added that some time back he had attempted to photograph an eclipse of the moon. He ran into difficulty getting enough exposure, further indicating that shots were of a bright object. (This was later disproved by taking test photos of the moon. It is possible his statement was misinterpreted.)

Mr. Harris impressed the interviewers as a typical newspaper editor. He made it very plain that he was not one to have someone use his paper to perpetuate a hoax. He has thoroughly checked both the photos and reports and believes

he had seen. He stated he had read about the objects in the newspaper and did not believe it. However, a few minutes before he had called, he had seen the same phenomena as was mentioned in the newspaper and was now convinced it was true. He stated that he had flown jets and had been around them and that this object was much faster than a jet. He said he couldn't give his name but would be glad to clear the story through the base PIO. This was never done, however, as the editor was not running any more stories on the incident and all records of the captain's name were gone.

Mr. Harris had been in the newspaper business about 20 years. Some of this time was spent as a PIO during WW II. He has a reputation of being very honest and will print nothing unless he is personally sure it is accurate. This is brought out by his very complete investigation of the authenticity of the "string of beads" stories.

Mr. Hams is considered one of the best photographers in Lubbock. He has had a studio for many years before coming to the newspaper. All the time he had a studio, he worked for the newspaper on a part-time basis.

5. Trip to Brownfield, Texas.

On the morning of 8 November 1951, Lt. Ruppelt and Capt. Parker of Reese AFB, drove to Brownfield, Texas, to investigate reports from this area.

Upon arrival at Brownfield, Jerry Stolts, Editor of the Brownfield News, was contacted. He made available all back issues of the newspapers. Several reports of incidents were found dated between 25 August and 31 August 1951. These were similar to the Lubbock descriptions of the incident except for one reported by a Mr. [redacted].

Mr. [redacted] was a man about 65 years of age. He had lived in West Texas all his life and is now retired. On the evening of 25 August 1951, he and his wife were sitting the backyard of their home when they noticed this group of lights go overhead from N to S. They were described as "kind of a glow, a little bigger than a star". Mr. [redacted] remarked about them to his wife. Soon another group came over. Neither flight was in a V shape, merely a group of about 15-20 lights. Some time later a third group flew over but instead of going straight over they circled the house. This group was either lower or in a different position because Mr. [redacted] stated he could see the objects and they were birds.

At the same time one of birds called (i.e. chirped) and Mr. [redacted] identified the sound as the call of a plover.

He stated that the next morning (26 August 1951), he read the Lubbock Morning Avalanche's account of the incident at Lubbock and if he had not identified the objects he saw as Plover he would have thought he had seen the same thing.

Lt. Ruppelt and Capt. Parker then went to the county Library and Brownfield High School Library to obtain information on Plover. It was found that there


- page 91 -

was a species of Plover with a white breast but no additional information could
be obtained.

By this time it was too late to go to Big Spring or Lamesa, Texas, so
the officers returned to Lubbock.


- page 92 -

6. Federal Wild Life Game Warden

On the afternoon of 8 November 1951, Lt. Buppelt and Capt Parker contacted the Federal Wildlife Game Warden at the Post Office Building in Lubbock. The purpose was to determine the habits and description of Plover.

It was determined that there are several kinds of Plover. Several types have white breasts and are found in West Texas. The bird is about 8" long and has a wing span of about 1'. It will fly at night and in groups but the groups are usually not larger than 5 or 6 birds. They are known to migrate south from late August till the middle of November. Also they have been seen in the Lubbock locality recently although not in great numbers. They fly at about 1000' or lower at a maximum of 50 Mph.

The game warden had not read the articles about the "objects" in the paper so was unfamiliar with the description of the objects, but tended to doubt if they were Plover. He added that they might be ducks but not geese because geese continually "honk" as they fly over populated areas.

7. Meeting with Texas Technical College Professors

On the evening of 8 November 1951, Lt. Ruppelt and Capt. Parker met with four professors of the Texas Technical College to discuss the aerial Phenomena they observed over a period of time from 25 August 1951 until about 15 Oct 1951.

Those present were:

a. [Redacted], Ph.D. in Geology but also well versed in all fields of science. The meeting was at his home.

b. [Redacted], Ph.D., Professor of Chemical Engineering

c. [Redacted], Ph.D., in Physics, presently head of the Texas Tech. Seismograph Station and has previously spent several years at the University of Alaska studying the aurora.

d. Prof. [Redacted], Head of the Petroleum Engineering Department.

On the evening of 25 August 1951, [Redacted] and [Redacted] were sitting in Dr. [Redacted] yard discussing a project on micro-meteorites that [Redacted] is conducting at Texas Tech. They were counting meteors when the first object passed over the yard. They stated they were surprised at the sight and began discussing it. They agreed that if another object came over they would attempt to find out some of its characteristics and about an hour later one did come over, one man listened while the other two timed it. This object, and the first one, was a semi-circle, about 160° arc, of lights. There was no discernable noise and the angular velocity was very close to 30° per second. The direction was about N to S, and they passed 15° -20° west of the Zenith. The men could not agree on the color except that it was yellowish to white. It varied in intensity and was somewhat larger in area than a star. All men agreed it appeared to have its own light source. Since 25 August 1951, these men and several others have seen more flights, approximately twelve. They all were of

the same nature as t first except there was no regu arrangement or formation.
Others who have seen the objects well in the presence of the original three men are:

a. [redacted], Ph.D. in Geology.
b. [redacted], Mathematics Professor.
c. [redacted], Studying for Ph.D.

Dr. [redacted] Astronomer from Texas Tech, has not observed the phenomena but has been present at all the investigations.

Several characteristics of the object have been noticed by the observers.

The lights always appear at about 50° in the S or SW. They never gradually come into view or gradually disappear. Its "span angle" from the ground was about 7° -8°.

They follow a rough schedule beginning about 2120 and appearing every hour and 10 minutes until three flights pass overhead. The men have attempted to determine whether or not there is any form between the lights by trying to observe stars between the lights. They have been unsuccessful however, due to the great speed of the object. Once they thought they observed stars between the objects but could not be sure.

The group is confident of the angular velocity of the object of 30°/second from measurements of several flights. Stop watches and protractors were used to measure time and angles. Several attempts have been made to measure the altitude.

On only one occasion has there been any clouds and these were widely scattered. The objects appeared but did not pass close enough to a cloud to obtain a relative altitude.

Several other attempts to determine the altitude were made by using triangulation from a measured base line. On the first occasion an eleven mile base line used with home-made angle measuring devices set up at each end of the base. Radios were used for communication from one end of the base line to the other. Another night a shorter baseline was used. On the first night, neither party observed the


- page 95 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

flights although two of their wives saw them from the city. On the second night
only one party thought they saw the object but they were not able to get a
measurement. The object appeared to be very low over the city of Lubbock.

A third attempt was made by Dr. ███████ the astronomer. He questioned
three people who saw the object as/their position and the angle of observation.
This technique is used in plotting the path of meteors. He arrived at an altitude
of between 2,000 and 3,000 feet. However, one of the observers was doubtful as
to the time she made observation so it could have been another object she saw,
consequently, they are not putting any reliability on this altitude measurement.

Two other incidents took place which the group would not mention at first
but finally did. They qualified the incidents with the statement that they are
so absurd they have never mentioned them. The first incident happened to Mrs.
███████, who according to several people is a very calm woman. Prof. ███████
stated that she came running into the house one evening just at dusk very excited.
Due to her usually calm manner, the excitement was very apparent. She said she had
seen a very large flying wing type aircraft, making no sound, go over the house.
She could offer no more description. Prof. ███████ could not remember exactly
when it took place as he had passed it off as being too fantastic. (Note:
Nearly identical to 25 August 1951 sighting in Albuquerque, New Mexico.)

The next incident was observed by Prof. ███████ and Dr. ███████ and has
been titled "███████Horror". The men were sitting in the yard waiting for
the "9:20", a term coined for the first object of the evening to pass over the
observers. (Strangely enough, there was a remarkable amount of regularity to
the flights of the objects.) All of a sudden a group of yellowish lights came across
the yard very low, and according to Prof. ███████, they had a "wiggling" motion. It
upset Dr. ███████ considerably, consequently the name "███████Horror".

Again the instance was dropped because no one else in the neighborhood saw it and
it was very low.

Appendix I
LUBBOCK, TEXAS - 25 August 1951

The first of a series of sightings relate to this incident occurred
the evening of 25 August 1951 at approximately 10:15, four Texas Tech-
nical College professors were sitting in the backyard of one of the professor's
homes observing meteors in conjunction with a study of micrometeorites being
carried out by the college. At 10:10 they observed a group of lights pass over-
head from N to E. The lights had about the same intensity as a bright star
but were larger in area. The altitude was not determined; at they traveled
at a high rate of speed. The pattern of the lights was almost a perfect semi-
circle containing from 20 to 30 individual lights. Later in the evening a
similar incident was observed and during a period of about three weeks a
total of approximately twelve (12) such flights were observed by these men.

The group of men include:

a.   The Head of the Petroleum Engineering Department
b.   Professor of Geology, has Ph.D.
c.   Professor of Physics, has Ph.L.
d.   Professor of Chemical Engineering, has Ph.D.

Besides the above four men the following have observed the incidents:

a.   Professor of Mathematics, has Ph.L.
b.   Graduate student working on Ph.D.

In addition, a Professor of Astronomy was consulted on the incident, but he
did not observe any of these flights.

The above mentioned men took a personal interest in the phenomena and
undertook a study of the objects. Attempts were made to obtain an altitude
measurement by laying out a measured base line perpendicular to the usual
flight path of the object at placing measuring devices at the end of
the base line, however, all their attempts failed because the objects did
not appear on the nights the observers were waiting for them.

From the series of observations, the following facts were obtained:

a.   The angular velocity of the object was very nearly 300 of arc per
     second.
b.   There was no sound that could be attributed to the object.
c.   The flight path of the object was from N to E in the majority of
     the flights.
d.   There were two or three flights per evening.
e.   The period between flights was about one hour and 10 minutes.

At this point in the conversation the unusual meteor activity in the SW United States was brought up. The group, with Dr. [redacted] the astronomer, has already attempted to associate the formation of lights with this activity, however, they could find no association between the two. Dr. [redacted] mentioned the fact that the series of events terminating with the large meteor that fell in Oklahoma on the morning of 7 November 1951 was very odd. They did not follow the general pattern of meteors. An expedition from several Southwestern Colleges is now being formed to attempt to find the one that is supposed to have fallen in Oklahoma.

Several meteors were reported to have fallen in the Lubbock area during the period Lt Ruppelt was there. In two instances people reported crashed aircraft, and Lt Ruppelt was present when B-25s were sent out to search. Later the locations where these "crashes" were reported were examined by Texas Tech people. They picked up some material that allegedly came from the object. A piece of this material has been obtained and will be analyzed. It may be ash from the many cotton gins located in the Lubbock area. According to Texas Tech chemists, if it is the potassium content will be high.( Lt report in file)

The above named men together with Dr. [redacted] an astronomer at Texas Tech, have developed a very great interest in their objects. Their genuine interest is brought out by the fact that they devoted an entire evening discussing the matter with Lt Ruppelt and Capt Parker, and they previously have had many meetings between themselves. They refuse to recognize any sightings not witnessed by at least two of the group although they admit many other reputable people have seen the objects. Thus the figure of twelve sightings is conservative. Their term is twelve "official sightings". They have made every effort to investigate all possibilities as to what the objects might be. It is apparent after listening

for them. (This can borne up by the fact that on morning of 7 November the very bright meteor mentioned above was visible from Reese AFB. It Ruppelt was in front of the Officer's Club with several other people. Only those of the group who were looking directly at the meteor saw it, and it was considered to be extremely bright.)

REPORT ON NIGHT FLYING OBJECTS

The first observations of these objects were made by Messrs. _____ rm on about 9:20 P.M. on August 25, 1951. Two flights were observed and were about five minutes apart. These observers have agreed that:

(1) The objects were traveling from northeast to southwest and passing slightly southeast of overhead of the City of Lubbock.

(2) Each flight consisted of a series of lights in an arcuate formation which covered about 10° in the sky.

(3) It was apparent that the arcs were not continuous. Individual objects could not be clearly distinguished, but rather they appeared as continuously point of blue-green color, clearly and plainly visible but not brilliant, and having approximately the same illumination as high cirrus clouds on a clear moonlight night.

(4) Immediately after the flights it was estimated that the velocities of the flights were thirty degrees per second through an arc of ninety degrees beginning forty-five degrees below the zenith to forty-five degrees beyond the zenith.

(5) Both flights were identical in size, shape, velocity, and course.

(6) No sound was associated with the flights.

During the following week the same observers witnessed five flights between the hours of 9 and 12 P.M., each passing through the sky from north to south. Additional details are:

(1) On September first (Saturday) the above three were joined by lesser flights. On that night two flights were seen similar to those previously seen but not in the clear arcuate form above described, but rather more irregularly grouped, and with definite and individual objects present in the formation.

(2) The apparent number of objects in these succeeding flights has been variously estimated as being from fifteen to thirty.

(3) The most unusual flight was observed at 12:17 A.M. on September second by the five people who had met for the purpose of making observations. This flight passed directly overhead in the general direction of north to south, and was seen by each member of the group.

Mr. [redacted] observed that in the case of this flight, an irregularly shaped yellow light appeared in the rear. The formation included dark diffuse areas, and the arc itself quivered or pulsed in the direction of its travel.

Mr. [redacted] first sighted this flight, and described it as a group of individually distinctly yellow objects, approximately twelve or fifteen in number, traveling at an extremely high velocity, each with an angular magnitude that would be the equivalent of twelve inches across at a distance of thirty or forty feet, and in violent agitation.

Mr. [redacted] described this flight as having the appearance of a group of from twelve to fifteen pale objects in the shape of a quadrant of a circle, producing a pale yellow blinking 11 secs, and moving slowly.

The two other observers, Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] agreed to the above descriptions in their essential detail.

The startling characteristics of this one flight made an observation difficult to impossible.

The members of this group have seen a total of ten or twelve flights of these objects between August 25 and about November 1, 1951.

1. This case was reopened in compliance with the verbal request of Lieutenant EDWARD J. RUPPELT, Office of Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB News, Dayton, Ohio, in telephone conversation on 15 November 1951 requesting reinterview of _______ in an effort to procure more definite technical information and the possibility of locating missing negative.

2. _______ visiting the Boy Scouts Executive Camp at Raton, New Mexico, was out of the city _______ was interviewed in private. The rights of a private citizen under the Fifth Amendment & the Constitution of the United States was explained to him and he acknowledged his understanding of such rights.

3. During this interview _______ did not deviate from the information obtained in the first interview by the writer or on the subsequent interview by the writer when accompanied by Lieutenant EDWARD J. RUPPELT, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB News, Dayton, Ohio, with the possible exception of the tracking and exposures of the unidentified objects on 30 August 1951.

4. _______ had obtained the pictures by tracking across the sky in the backyard of his residence. _______ explained in detail that allowing; for the loss of thirty (30) degrees of vision to the north and to a line of trees and a duplicating lens of thirty (30) degrees due to the contour of the residence that he had used half of the remaining arc of vision in attempting to center objects in the range finder and then as they had passed the center and he had pivoted and taken three (3) pictures while tracking. _______ was very positive of this particular phase, questioned as to the missing negative, _______ stated that it had never been located, was still missing and was not in his possession.

5. _______ was requested to make a statement in his own handwriting covering the incident. _______ hesitated about the request. When he was reluctant to make any statement, stating that he had told the whole truth of the incident and that he could not see where a statement from him would have any effect on the investigation. However, he agreed, if possible, to talk to his own kids Friday, to Lubbock, Texas, upon his return later in the day. This request was granted.

6. At 1730 hours, 2 December 1951, the writer received a telephone call from _______, stating that his son had talked over the possibility of making a written statement with him and that _______ had made a short written statement which was available.

7. At 1745 hours, 2 December 1951, the statement was obtained from [redacted]
which is not forth verbatim:

"On Aug 50, 1951 at about 11:30 PM took pictures of strange
objects passing overhead from North to South. I saw three separate
groups of objects. No pattern or of the second group. Three are
of the third group. The last negative has not been found and is not
in my possession."

8. On 20 November 1951, WILLIAM PHILIP HAMS, Photographer for the Avalanche-
Journal, Danville, Virginia, was interviewed as to his knowledge of the type
of work, the authenticity of the pictures turned in by [redacted], during a
period covering approximately one (1) year. Mr. HAMS stated that he believed
to be the best news photographer in the newspaper and vividly and that [redacted]
never than any occasion to doubt his work. In referring to the pictures taken
by him on 30 August 1951, HAMS stated that the newspaper had also been doubtful as
to the authenticity of the negative and that newspaper tests on the negatives
before they were published in the newspaper. HAMS further stated that these tests
were very thorough and that they had used the technical knowledge of other photo-
graphers in the city and from said tests of the negatives of the young man had
learned with him in any way. HAMS did not believe that anyone would attempt to perpetrate
a "hoax" as the young man had turned in several times very remarkable pictures
which had been authentic.

9. All investigation as requested having been completed and there being no
further undeveloped leads, this case is closed.

f. The color of the lights was blue-white.

g. There were from 20 to 30 separate lights in each formation.

h. The first two flights observed were a semi-circle of lights but in subsequent flights there was no orderly arrangement.

i. The object always appeared at an angle of about 50° from horizontal in the north and disappeared at about 60° in the south. The object did not gradually come into view or vanish gradually, but appeared from a distance, neither did it probably disappear.

j. There was no apparent change in size as the object passed overhead.

Attempts were made to obtain the relative height of the object in respect to clouds. However, these attempts were also unsuccessful due to the fact that the objects raced between widely scattered clouds.

Efforts to determine whether or not there was any formation between the lights by trying to see stars between the lights were unsuccessful. This also was unsuccessful due to the short time the object was in view.

This phenomena was observed by at least one hundred people in and around Lubbock, Texas. Some of these people were of the opinion that the objects were birds.

On the evening of 31 August 1951, at about 2235 CST, a college freshman from Texas Tech observed three flights of the object and directly obtained five photographs. He obtained two chaos of one flight and three of another. These photos show single rows of light in V-formation on two photos and a double row on the others. His description of the object is much the same as that of the college professors, except that the college professors never observed a perfect V-formation.

(See Appendix II and V for possibly related incidents.)

Status of the Investigation

Project Grudge personnel made a trip to Lubbock, Texas, on 6-9 November 1951 to obtain more details on the incident. Many sources who had seen the object or who were involved in the sighting were interviewed. A conference was held with the college professors and they offered to write a detailed account of their observations and forward it to ATIC. This report should be forthcoming.

The photographer who claims to have photographed the object was interrogated. Every effort was made to find a flaw in the photographer's account of the incident, but the results were negative. The college professors did not believe the photographs were authentic as they had never observed a V-shaped group of lights. They were not sure, however, or not they had observed the same objects that were photographed. Since the interrogation, two

PHYSICS BRANCH
SENSITOMETRY UNIT
29 NOV 1951

SUBJECT: Evaluation of 35 mm. Negatives

FACTUAL DATA
1. Four negative frames were submitted from the Air Technical Intelligence Center for photographic evaluation by the Sensitometry Unit. These negatives were exposed at approximately 2330 CST, 30 Aug 1951, at Lubbock, Texas.

The camera was the familiar Kodak 35 with coupled range-finder and a 50 mm (2 inch) f/3.5 Anastor Kodak lens.

The Plus X film was exposed for 1/10 sec with lens aperture wide open, presumably with the camera hand-held and the film was processed in Panthermic 777 developer for 15 min.

An interpretation of the configuration of spots was requested, in addition to general sensitometric notes.

2. A preliminary microscopic examination of the negatives disclosed the presence of patterns of spots, the patterns on the four frames being generally similar. Roughly 20 spots were visible on each negative in a flat "V" formation. In 3 negatives the formation consists of


- page 117 -

two rows, while the fourth shows all spots lined up in
a single row. All negatives show evidence of camera
motion during exposure, since the spots all are similarly
blurred on the same negative, and the blur shape is dif-
ferent for each negative.

3. To resolve the formations and detect internal
motion of the spots, each negative was examined on a large
comparator microscope. The rectangular coordinates of
each spot, relative to a convenient origin of coordinates,
were read and then plotted on coordinate paper. It is
emphasized here that the resulting plot is erect, but a
mirror image from left to right, of the actual object
photographed.

4. Little significance, other than brightness
variations, can be found from the negatives separately.
When the charts were superimposed, however, it was readily
apparent that the two rows of spots behaved differently.
One row shows only slight variation from a precise "V"
formation throughout, whereas the other row appears to
pass from above the first row, through it to a position
below. The spacings of this second row vary irregularly
in the 3 frames plotted, while the first row holds a
