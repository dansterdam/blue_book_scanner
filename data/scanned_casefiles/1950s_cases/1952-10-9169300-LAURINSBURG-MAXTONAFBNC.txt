SUMMARY (BRIEF NARRATIVE STATEMENT OF THE ESSENTIAL DETAILS OF OBSERVATION)

1. On 22 October 1952, at approximately 0312, an unidentified flying object was visually sighted by A/2C unard F. DEMOTTE on guard at Laurinburg-Maxton A'r Base. Light, weight, and color unknown. DEMOTTE stated that his first impression was that a huge shape was floating at him from the south. As the object came nearer he could distinguish two (2) red 13 to 15 ft. toward part of the object and as it passed over his he could see approximately eight (8) or ten (10) broadly green lights at the rear. The object was not too high and appeared to be oval-shaped approximately one to two hundred feet across.

2. As the object approached, it was seen to be in a 180 degree turn was red directly over DEMOTTE verifying the previous position. The object then made another 180 degree turn appeared to be southward. No object then flew a straight course and as it disappeared in the horizon sound became audible. Starting faintly, and building up to a loud roar, it passed over the observer, then a total mass. The same sound was verified by two (2) other airmen whose statements are attached.

2. Attached as inclosure one (1) is a copy of TX prepared in accordance with par 7G, AF LTR 200-5, 29 April 1952.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

STATEMENTS OF WITNESSES

I, the undersigned, on the 22nd day of October 1952, at 2210 hours, was walking my guard post and heard this noise up in the sky. I looked up and saw this huge round object moving overhead. It was between one-hundred and fifty (150) feet in diameter. The object had two (2) red lights in the front and side (R) to twelve (12) green lights in the rear. They were steady lights and not blinking on and off as an aircraft light does. It had a huge circular sound to it. This droning noise has never before been heard by this individual. The object circled the area once and then flew away to the Southeast. I called the Command of the Guard to witness it but by the time he came out the object was flying away at a terrific speed that I could not begin to judge.

I, the undersigned, heard a loud droning sound from overhead while lying in my bunk on the night of 22 October 1952 at 2210 hours. The sound was not that of a conventional type plane nor a jet type. In a quick call to the Air Policeman on duty, came running up to the tent and called for me to come out and see the lights surrounding it. I got out there as quick as possible but the plane already moved out (2) miles west of the Laurinburg-Maxton Air Base where we were. I saw the lights but could not distinguish the shape of it. It was traveling at a front rate of speed.

/s/
A/1C USAF

I, the undersigned, on 22 October 1952, 2210 hours, saw and heard what is believed to be a flying saucer. The reason I have for believing it to be a flying saucer is the noise was indistinguishable from that of a jet aircraft or that of a conventional type aircraft. I saw a few green lights in a circular motion, but no other identification was obtainable.
