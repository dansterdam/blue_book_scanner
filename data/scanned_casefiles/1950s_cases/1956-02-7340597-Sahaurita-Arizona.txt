DATE: March 16, 1956

About 11 AM on Feb. 25th 1956 about 15 miles south of Tucson, Ariz., we noticed a spherical object which appeared over the foothills of the mountains to the west of us. We judged it to be about two miles away and seemed to have over the desert and then descended almost to the ground and then reascend. We had good binoculars and all four of us in turn attempted to clarify the object as something familiar but we unable to do so. We drew a mile or so to the small town of Sahuarita. There we stopped and reported the object. They were interviewed and I felt like a fool or mental incompetent. Since we had no official assistance we got little investigative counsel. There was a great hesitancy on the part of the director of the flight as we drew toward it slipping. The object though the binoculars. We had first thought the object was landing on the desert floor but after viewing a group of rocks and not getting much closer we decided it had been descending by the range 10 or 15 degrees from the horizon. The rest here I will not very briefly noted. We were not able to get much more close. These didn't seem to be long great in writing longer. We had a 8 mile move toward us but felt the object was too far away to appear in a position so we didn't use it. There were two or three patterns of the horizon we might describe the object and we saw it but they were of lesser importance. We were about a form from home later but the object was gone. Briefly, we did not stop for investigation. We were extremely reluctant to interview the witnesses. We experienced a social people, were more inhibited. Other people to whom we spoke did not stop in the report. We might say that we did not stop to investigate, we will say, nothing about it to the general public.

Here is the text from the document:

Thank you for your answer to my report and for the additional information. I don't concur with the opinion that the object we saw was a follow-up, but I feel that someone is interested and that we weren't having bad dreams. If we could be of any further help we of course would do so.

Following is a rough sketch of the area as I remember it.

At the bottom of the page, there is a hand-drawn map with the text "ANGELES - TUCSON HIGHWAY" and an indication of "N" for North.

Reference is made to paragraph 2 of 1st Ind. and paragraph 2a and 2nd Ind. Records available indicate that flight 1-2 was east of 80° W. Longitude and that flight 1-5 had terminated before 25/1800Z February 1956. Therefore, it appears that neither of these flights account for the report mentioned in the basic letter.

1.   This Center has no record of balloon flights #18 or #19 having been launched from Vernalis NAS on 22 or 23 February 1956. However, during the two day period 23-24 February 1956 flights I-1 through I-5 were launched from this site. Of these five flights, I-1, I-3, and I-4 terminated prematurely, the maximum flight time of the three being that of I-4, which was approximately 2 hours 44 minutes. Flights I-2, launched 23 February, 1956, and I-5, launched 24 February, 1956, remained aloft for several days prior to terminating and remained within the ZI for the greater part of their time in the air.

2.   We request that you inform us of the approximate location of the subject unidentified flying object (UFOB) sighting in order that we might inspect our available trajectory information on flights I-2 and I-5.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

WOULD MAKE A LARGE CASTING OF IRON AND LEAVE IT IN A ROUGH FINISH. WOULD ALLOW IT TO RUST OR DETERIORATE UNTIL IT WAS IN THE SHAPE OF A ROUGH SPHERE, IT'S SIZE MAYBE 10 FEET OR MAYBE 50 FEET IN DIAMETER. I WOULD COVER IT WITH THE ABILITY TO BE SELF PROPELLED IN THE AIR. THIS METHOD OF SELF PROPULSION MIGHT CAUSE IT TO GIVE OFF HEAT.

IN MY PERSONAL OPINION IT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLED PICTURES I HAVE SEEN OF FLOATING MINES. I KNOW IT SOUNDS SILLY BUT THAT IS HOW I CAN BEST DESCRIBE IT.
