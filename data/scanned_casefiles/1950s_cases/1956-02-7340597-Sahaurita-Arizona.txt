Thank you for your interest in my report and for the additional information. I don't agree with the opinion that the object we saw was anything other than what it appeared to be. I'm sure what I saw, but I don't want to speculate or make claims that cannot be verified. If any further reliable information comes to light, I would be glad to assist. Following is the text from the document, as requested:
