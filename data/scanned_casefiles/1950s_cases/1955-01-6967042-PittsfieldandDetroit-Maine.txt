NO CASE INFO NATION ONLY (header)

WINTER 54 or 55 (top right)

SAFOI-34/Maj Tacker/emo/72091

Dear Major Foster:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 25 March 1960 concerning your intention to write a magazine article on an unidentified flying object sighting in Alaska during the winter of either 1954 or 1955.

In your letter you state that this is a solved case. The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio has no record of this sighting and, therefore, the evaluation or solution must have been made locally at the time.

This office has no objection to your writing on this particular sighting nor publication provided the manuscript is submitted to this office for security, accuracy and policy clearance in accordance with AFM 190-4.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE T. TACKER

Remarks:
Larry- This is a doozey. To begin, we have no record of this case in the files here. Also, for your info only, our UFO non-com here, Sgt. Bolien, was working under Foster in Alaska during the time mentioned and he knows nor remembers anything of the case. A Maj. Cooper here, who was also there at the time, knows nothing of it. Significantly, Foster himself doesn't remember whether it was the winter of 1954 or 1955. How in the hell can he write objectively about it?

With reference to paragraph of his letter, I think he should be told that the Air Force, and particularly ATIC has the responsibility for investigation of UFO and we have no desire to interest others, who are not qualified nor responsible, in making a latent investigation. Especially since a solution must have been arrived at locally in the Alaskan Command, and ATIC was not even advised. Looks to me like he is trying to get into something he knows little about.

SUBJECT: Release of Information of Solved UFO Investigation

TO:   HQ USAF Public Information Office
       Washington 25, DC

THRU: Director of Intelligence, HQ USAF
        Washington 25, DC

1. For the benefit of the Air Force space research program I would like to obtain the release of information concerning an investigation of an "unidentified flying object" in Alaska conducted during the winter of October 1955. It is possible that valuable information might be obtained by either a USAF team or some interested university team if this requested information were made available. Although the investigation led to a "solved" case, very little information of the sighting was made public.

2. As a member of the 5006th Air Intelligence Service Squadron, Alaskan Air Command, I investigated the case. Since this "Michigan, amateur astronomer, electronics engineer and nuclear instrumentation technician, I have recently come to the conclusion that a number of questions remained unanswered in this investigation. Since the Michigan was assumed to be a meteorite, no further interest was taken following conclusion by the Air Force of the investigation. Now, however, information is to be gained from examination of the object or the impact area. Indeed, we are in the process of gaining interest to the Air Force in its present search for knowledge of space through the examination of over-falling bodies which occasionally come within the gravitational field of the earth.

3. The object burned so brilliantly that it was seen thru a dense and wide-spread halo cloud that covered the whole of western Alaska. It was so intense and since even the largest previously known meteorites (such as the great Siberian meteorite early in the 1900's) generally only sufficient heat energy, being gaseous or a hydrogen burst, this particular "meteorite" has some rather startling and unexplained characteristics. It burned with the brilliance of a hydrogen bomb yet an about 15 tons of the first hydrogen bomb exploded by this country, and for the first 36 hours of the investigation, the Alaskan Air Command was convinced that an enemy hydrogen explosion had taken place far to the west.

4. Reports came into Alaskan Air Command early one morning from daily to uttered 400 posts in a fresh school of 17 year and younger people.


- page 16 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

They had seen a brilliant light thru the blizzard and overcast, to the west of their position. The light flared for fifteen minutes. No noise was heard which means the object must have been a long distance from the area. A little later a report was received from Umiakleet, far to the north. There the light had been seen in a southwesterly direction. Late in the investigation a report was received from Unalak Island reporting they had seen the light to the northeast. This established, thru triangulation, that the light source was on the mainland of Alaska. Up to this time there was no knowledge of a meteorite.

5. Early in the investigation no USAF or civil aircraft had been reported as airborne in the vicinity of the sighting. Belatedly, it was learned that a B-50 weather reconnaissance aircraft operating out of Eielson AFB had been in the area. The crew members were routed from bed at their homes at 0200 in the morning for interrogation and the information immediately telephoned to Eielson/AFR. The crew members added they had seen a tremendously large mass of about ten minutes prior to a normal radio reporting sequence but for unexplainable reasons had not reported the phenomena.

6. Both pilots stated the meteor had looked as large as an orange held at arms length and had appeared to be heading straight for the aircraft on a course nearly parallel to the earth's surface. Than it became apparent that the path of the object was downward and to the right of the aircraft which was heading south and a little west. The pilot had estimated the object disappeared thru the undercast from a long tube and evidently burned for a long time after striking the ground somewhere off to the right. From their position at the time, however, compared with the impact point established by triangulation, the object was more than 100 miles ahead of the aircraft. When it crossed its path, the impact area of the object was found to be an area about 30 miles long by 15 miles wide in a very desolate, uninhabited region. No greater accuracy was possible with the sparse information available. No person is known to have gone to the area to determine exactly the impact location.

7. Questions which might be answered by further investigation are: What coalition or material could have caused the long-burning intense brilliance of the object? (Almost all known meteorites are rich in iron or rock with minute distribution of many other elements including uranium) was the object a member of known swarms orbiting in our solar system? (Perhaps this could be determined by the approach path of the object and the known time of sighting) was the object actually a meteorite? (No attempt at examination was made) Is there any residual radioactivity in the area? Since the apparent path of the orbit resembles orbits of some of the Russian satellites of 1957 and later, is it possible this Russian event in 1954 or 1955 had attempted such a launching? And if so, would knowledge of this influence our present Air Force planning?

8. If no objection is forthcoming -- and incidentally if Air Force is uninterested in further search or examination -- I request permission to write an article for magazine publication on this sighting, in the hope of interesting others who might wish to investigate the area. Your permission in this area, of course, on the national interest, but I would appreciate a response to this inquiry.

Source: UFO Investigator July-August 1960

January, 1955; Wilmington, Cal.-- A compressed UFO similar in form to a saucer was sighted at about 1:00 p.m. by actor George Reeves, who was near the 110 p.m. of actor Locke. The UFO, when first sighted, was hovering, descended at low altitude and hovered just in light. A physical projection like a sand then became visible in the sky, and a beam of light came from what looked like a searchlight, a mobile clinking noise and a whining noise like a generator were noted for a few seconds. Then the lights went out and the UFO began moving slowly, losing altitude, and was sighted down in the direction of action. George Reeves of the JA moved off. It caused 15 minutes of excitement and appeared to be metallic.

Oregonians Sight
Eerie Blue Light

LA GRANDE, Ore. Jan. 28—
(AP)—A strange blue light is reported burning in the air over the
Blue mountains along the Wallowa-Elgin highway these cold winter
nights.

It was first seen about two
weeks ago. A state highway department snowplow team of Sam Thompson reported that they saw
a blue light on the highway ahead
of them. Erickson, driving, told
this story:

He dimmed his lights. There
was no change in the blue light
which seemed to be coming
toward him on the highway.
Erickson stopped. So did the
blue light. Then it started moving
up, down and sideways. At the
moment of this, it moved upward
and vanished over the trees to the
left, with a hum.

A week later, Robert Backus,
another plow driver, stopped to
check one of his chains. As he
stood outside he noticed with
some surprise that he was casting
a shadow in the blue light, he
said, and overhead was the blue
light bobbing and from it came a
humming sound.
