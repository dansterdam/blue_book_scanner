1. This organization received a report of sightings of unidentified objects on 30 April 1957. As Air Force Regulation 200-2 is not available in this unit, the following narrative report will be submitted in lieu thereof.

2. Mr. [redacted] reported to First Lieutenant Robert G. Record, Jr. that he and [redacted], both seniors at Holy Cross College, sighted some unidentified objects on 22 April 1957. The following is a synopsis of what Mr. [redacted] reported.

a. The unidentified objects were sighted on three (3) occasions between the hours 2205 and 2240.

b. The first sighting was of a single object directly overhead heading South to North. The color of the object was rust red. Its size was approximately the size of a half collar held at arm's length. Duration of the sighting was seven (7) seconds.

c. The object appeared in the vicinity of the big dipper, heading North where it slowed down and then increased its speed to a high rate over the City of Worcester.

d. The second sighting was of seven (7) unidentified objects in a straight line. These objects were colored silver red and apparently were smaller than the first sighting. The duration of the sighting was approximately two (2) minutes.

e. The third sighting was about twenty (20) minutes after the second sighting. There were twelve (12) objects in a "V" formation and the siding lasted about four (4) seconds. In this sighting, the objects were higher than the other two (2) sightings.

3. These sightings occurred while looking for new comets that were to be seen at that time. The address of both individuals is presently at the Holy Cross College, Worcester, Massachusetts.
