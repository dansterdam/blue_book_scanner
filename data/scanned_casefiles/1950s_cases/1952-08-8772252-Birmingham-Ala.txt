AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

AREA REPORTED ON: Birmingham, Alabama     FROM (Agency/Headquarters): 4157th AISS, Training

DATE OF REPORT: 5 Sept. 1952           DATE OF INFORMATION: 27 August 1952     EVALUATION: 

REFERENCES: A.F. Reg. 200-5, dated 29 April 1952

SUMMARY: (Give summary of report, first paragraph brief interpretation of significance. List locations at lower left. Digest of report on AF Form 112-Part I(a))

On the night of 27 August, 1952, two officers listed in the source of this information were in an F-51 airplane at 3,000 feet just west of the Birmingham airport, Birmingham, Alabama. They were flying at 250 mph, at 2,045 hours they saw an unidentified object moving toward the northwest below them and to their right at a range of 3,200 feet.

Source identified the object as a pale blue light of undetermined size and of no specific shape. It left no trail and no exhaust or other sound was audible. It was blinking off and on in no particular cadence or frequency. No action or propulsion was discernible.

At first this object moved around the city of Birmingham in a wide circle in a counter-clockwise direction. It finally began to climb, as which time it covered a range of about 15,000 feet. It was last observed after having been under observation for about 15,000 feet. It was last observed after having been under source's observation for about 15,000 feet. At this time it was traveling at a speed estimated at from 1,500 to 1,750 mph.

The weather was clear with a slight haze over Birmingham. There was little or no wind. This sighting cannot be explained by any known activity or condition or atmospheric or otherwise. No photographs or other substantial evidence of the nature or existence of the object. No effort was made to intercept it.

Bystanders on cross country flights in F-51 airplanes saw other similar incidents. They saw all well-lighted objects at night. Other aircraft were seen.

AF FORM 112—PART II
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Headquarters) Headquarters, 3615th Air Base Wing, Craig AFB, Alabama
TO: Hq. USAF, ATTN: AFOIN-X2

REPORT NO. 1952-8-252
DATE 8 Aug 52
PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

The following statement is submitted in accordance with paragraph 7.g., AF letter 0115 dated 27 April 1952.

1. At 2043 hours on 27 August 1952, we sighted a sighting unidentified object. At 2135 was a mile this color of unidentified size. We observed only a white light which was observed initially. The unidentified object was a white pillar or disc with no set sequence between its glitter. It would glide off and on intermittently. On about one and one-half to two miles from my position, four or five times our rate of speed. It was impossible for us to detect any sound. We were maneuvering around the area. The white object was under observation ground level—and when first sighted it was yellow-white, rose at 1,000 feet. Landed in a marshy area approximately 15 miles west of Birmingham. Flew to ten miles. It then started climbing at a tremendous rate of climb and then it was a tremendous white light. It was a pillar that would flicker out and back on it looked as though it is 15 to 20 feet long. It disappeared almost as quickly as it came. We could hear no sound.

2. It was sighted at 2043 and in last contact at 2053.

3. We sighted object visually from air at 7,000 feet. We were flying a two-seater T-6 and were flying at 250 m.p.h.

4. I was over Birmingham at 7,333 feet just west of Birmingham airport. I was in front cockpit. I sighted object in my area looking toward the southeast, slightly north of the airport.

5. I was a C-47 pilot in World War II, flying F-47. I flew 115 missions. I do not feel I was seeing a mirage or possible hallucination.

6. The weather was clear enough for a very light haze over Birmingham.

7. I know of no conditions or activity that can explain the object.

8. I know of no material evidence of the existence or nature of this object.

9. We made a tight turn to keep object in sight but could not interfere.

10. Incidents in past airman's reports over Birmingham at approximately three different times. No other aircraft were near.

APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Hqrs, 3516th Air Base Unit, ATC, Maxwell AFB, Alabama
DATE: 29 April 1952
REPORT NO.: 52-52     PAGE: 1 OF 1 PAGES

STATEMENT OF FACTS:

1. The following statement is submitted in accordance with AFR 11, 5, 6, AFR 200-5.

2. The 15th sighted was a flickering light affair of undoers and altitude. The light was white to blue white, 1st sighted on a strut at course. The light moved to turn and to 1 to 2 second intervals was in a rather erratic manner. It flickered in a manner observable to some kind of rocket propulsion which would turn out to be a rocket. The object was in good visual control, or 95 miles an hour. It had a condition. Traveled in south wide orbit around local area making a total of 20-25 miles. At the time the pilot placed it at 15,000 feet, the object connected to suddenly made off the course 2 or 3 times. The pilot was not sure. I was satisfied on the basis of what I saw that the entire 10 minutes of observation caused when it passed directly overhead at an altitude of 15,000 feet or more, was I was clearly able to see the full characteristics of the object. An estimation of speed based upon the relative radius of circles it was making to what I saw was approximately 250 miles per hour. It was easily observed its over the wing section at a terrific speed at mile or miles. It was easily observed its over the wing section at 15,000 feet.

3. The object was sighted at 2043 and was both in sight until 2053.

4. The object was seen visually from the air (from an F-51 traveling 250 knots).

5. I was sitting in the rear seat of a patrol F-51 flying on westerly direction. Then I saw it. It was approximately 3 or 4 miles out, just traveling from southeast to northwest very close to the Brookley airport.

6. I have a total of 1,450 hours single engine time. A veteran of 151 missions in Korea and 6 months service in Austria in 1945.

7. The weather was clear except for all its solitude which resulted in very little haze. The visibility of the city of Birmingham.

8. I know of no activity or condition that could explain the object.

9. I know of no physical evidence to prove the existence or nature of this object.

10. I took no interception action.

11. Students in F-51 airplanes reported over Birmingham at approximately three (3) hours interval.
