The report describes the sighting of two unidentified flying objects over Birmingham, Alabama on April 9, 1952. The objects were observed by multiple witnesses and were described as elliptical or oval in shape, about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and moving at a high rate of speed. The objects were observed for several minutes before disappearing from view. The report concludes that the objects could not be identified as any known aircraft.

Air Intelligence Information Report
The following is submitted in accordance with paragraph 7a, AR 380-5, 15 August 1952:
1. On 6 August 1952, at approximately 1325 hours, a red, oval-shaped object, estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter, was observed in the vicinity of Birmingham, Alabama. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet and was traveling at an estimated speed of 250 to 300 mph.
2. The object was observed by a Commercial Airlines pilot and co-pilot who reported that the object followed their aircraft for approximately 10 to 15 seconds, then accelerated and pulled away at a tremendous rate of speed.
3. No other aircraft was in the vicinity at the time and no unusual sounds were heard.
4. I know of no intentions or activity that can explain the objects.
5. I know of no material evidence or the existence or nature of this object.
6. The approximate position of the object was over Birmingham, Alabama, as approximately three miles southwest of the city.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PAGE 1 OF 1
SECR-T
THE OBJECT WITNESSED IS BELIEVED TO BE A NATURAL CELESTIAL PHENOMENON IN ACCORDANCE WITH USAF TR 200-2. ON 29 APRIL 1952, TWO AF RESERVISTS ATTACHED TO THE 117TH FIGHTER BOMBER WING, ALABAMA AIR NATIONAL GUARD, BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 3 MILES ABOVE THEIR POSITION, TRAVELING IN A NORTH TO SOUTH DIRECTION AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 500 KNOTS. THE OBJECT WAS SILVER OR WHITE IN COLOR AND WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES BEFORE DISAPPEARING TO THE SOUTH. THE LIGHTS ON THE OBJECT WERE REPORTED TO BE STEADY AND UNBLINKING.
THE OBSERVERS STATED THAT THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH JET AIRCRAFT, GUIDED MISSILES, AND OTHER CONVENTIONAL TYPES OF AIRCRAFT AND THAT THIS OBJECT APPEARED TO BE NEITHER A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT NOR A MISSILE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS OBJECT WAS OBSERVED IN A CLEAR NIGHT SKY AND APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING IN A NORTH TO SOUTH DIRECTION AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE OBJECT WAS A NATURAL CELESTIAL PHENOMENON SUCH AS A METEOR OR A SATELLITE. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED.
