I RFT 1 vapor trail was seen. No RFT no lights similar to the type used on a RFT were seen. _______ was able to see aircraft. Capt. Forced but his binoculars failed to reveal any object at the originating point of the vapor trail became of the altitude of the alleged aircraft.

Capt. Aircraft, Number 5656 was the plane expected to reach the area for landing at the same time as the alleged incident.

Preliminary inquiries revealed a similar incident was alleged to have occurred at this station in January 1952 but was not reported. Evaluation, Charlie 32, action Base Commander notified. Investigation requested and written report followed."
