III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE'S attention was drawn to the sky in the southwest by a friend who had seen the unusual object there. The time was 22/0610S Feb 56. To SOURCE, the light of the object was almost a bright as Venus and a color change was visible. The object appeared to change direction and it moved away from observer and grew dimmer. SOURCE noticed that at first the object had appeared to the naked eye about the size of a hatpin. Through the telescope SOURCE stated that the object appeared as a blur of colored light. There was neither sound nor smoke and exhaust associated with the UFO. The light appeared to shift slightly to the west. SOURCE first imagined as if the object was approximately 12° with the horizon when he first viewed it, was that it was Venus, however he later learned that Venus wasn't out at the time. SOURCE observed the angle which the light made with the horizon gradually decreased, as if the object or the star were acting.

SOURCE was certain that the phenomenon was neither a comet nor a falling star. The light was viewed for approximately 30 minutes by SOURCE.

II. RELIABILITY: Fair. SOURCE was contacted personally.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that he was walking across the college campus at 22/08002 Feb 56, when he looked up in the sky and saw in the southwest an object which appeared to be writhing and emitting smoke. The object was approximately 25° with the horizon.

SOURCE related that upon viewing the object through a telescope, (same instrument mentioned in Part I) it appeared to be moving in a circular manner "shooting off" different colored lights.

SOURCE believed the object was oscillating and traveling at a fantastic speed. There seemed to be a thin streak of smoke trailing the object. SOURCE also felt that he had seen another object behind and above the first. The two objects were a great distance apart.

Object was "circling". The direction of the UFOB continued to be SW until it began to diminish in size and seem to fade away.

SOURCE observed the object for approximately 45-minutes.

                                                                            Page 8 of 13 PAGES

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check was made with the U.S. Weather Bureau at Byrd Field, Richmond, Va. to determine whether they would be able to confirm the sighting. However winds aloft at the time of the sighting were such as to have prevented any weather balloons launched at Byrd Field (GeoRef GJN/3232) from drifting into the vicinity of Hampton-Sydney, Va. The following winds data current at the time of the UFOB sighting was released:

ALTITUDE:     DIRECTION:     WIND VELOCITY:
4,000         310°           34 K
10,000        310°           32 K
16,000        300°           45 K
20,000        300°           39 K
30,000        290°           52 K
40,000        270°           38 K
50,000        60°            6 K

2. A check with the GOC Filter Center, Richmond, Virginia revealed that this agency had no additional information on the sighting near Cape Charles, Va. No other reports on the object than the original report from observers at Hampton-Sydney College had come in to confirm the sighting.

3. The 647th ACAK Squadron, Manassas, Virginia, was called by telephone for any information which they may have had which would confirm a UFOB near Hampton-Sydney. This installation was unable to offer any evidence to support the sighting.

4. The 717th ACAK Sq., Cape Charles, Va. (GeoRef GJN 0201), likewise was contacted for confirmation on the UFOB, however no additional information on the original sighting had been received by the 717th after the report in the GOC Pilot Center in Richmond, Va. (GeoRef GJN/3382).

5. Efforts to seek more information proved slightly more fruitful when the 604th ACAK Sq. Bedford, Va. (GeoRef GJN 2820) released the following radar data recorded at the appraised time of the sighting:

Radar Plot "Bathbox", 22 Feb 56
Track # 0E25....(1) One aircraft or object; estimated speed 180 knots; altitude 7,000 feet.

INITIAL PLOT:
a. 0611Z/GJMB4025       g. 06252/GJMG 0051

f. 0623Z/GJMG0359

6. The CAA tower at Byrd Field, Richmond, Va. was queried for possible information on the object which may have been received from pilots flying in the vicinity reporting the appearance and characteristics of an unidentified flying object. Negative results.

7. A check with Air Traffic Control Center at Washington National Airport (GeoRef GJN 5856) for information which might serve to confirm the sighting yielded negative results.

8. A call was placed to the US Naval Observatory in Washington, DC (GeoRef GJN 5858). Mr. J. L. Gessner, of the observatory's Equatorial Division, made some interesting comments with respect to the two stars Sirius and Procyon. Sirius is frequently seen to sparkle almost as a diamond in the colors, red, blue and green when viewed at an angle of 10° to 20° with the horizon. This phenomena has been observed for many years by astronomers and oftentimes has been the source of car and pedestrian to unformed paranoia visiting it for the first time. The color scintillation of Sirius, according to Mr. Gessner, is due to turbulent eddies in the atmosphere which act as amplifier which scatter and prismatic the light. For example, a ray of blue light will reach the retina of the observer followed a fraction of a second later by a ray of red light, which will permit only for a second but sufficiently to rearrange the image of red. Any of the rays may be cut off momentarily creating the effect of the light flashing or flickering. Separated at such with each ray traveling along a different path through the atmosphere the spectra will reach the observer's retina in distinct colors and successively, so as to create the phenomena of flashing colors of light originating from one given source.

This dispersion and refraction of light created by the turbulent eddies in the lower atmosphere is likewise responsible for the brilliant flashing of red, blue and white light seen from an angle of 20° or less.

9. Dr. Edward R. Dyer, Professor of Astronomy at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia (GeoRef GJN 2030), stated that both Sirius and Procyon could have been seen at the reported altitude of 26/0612Z Feb 56. According to the professor's calculations, Sirius would have been 16° above the horizon at 22/0600Z radiating a brilliant red, green and blue lights. The lights probably would have seemed to sparkle more than usual due to a cool outflow atmosphere and clear sky conditions. The day of 21 February had been unusually warm creating considerable turbulence in the lower atmosphere during the evening.

Sirius was at the extreme altitude of 22/0711Z on 21 February 56 near Front Royal, Virginia location. Above and to the right of Sirius approximately 26° is the star Procyon.

The professor suggested that the appearance of colored lights was brilliant. Associated with the phenomenon was a celestial navigation (See Part I and Part V) discussion of SIGHTING, for object's apparent oscillatory motion).

When told of the 60-power telescope which the boys at Hampton-Sydney College had used, it was the professor's opinion that the telescope undoubtedly had been out of focus, a poor part of the time, due to improper calculation of the earth's rotation creating wide excitement among the observers viewing the probable distortions on the telescope lens.

10. A recontact with Hampton-Sydney College, Hampton, Virginia, revealed the following information which might serve to confirm that the 22 February sighting had been celestial in origin. Student who contacted the stated that two nights after the original UFOB sighting at 25/0451Z he had observed an object which appeared over a telephone pole approximately 25° from the horizon. The direction of the object was SW. The phenomenon observed was brilliant flashes of white, red, blue and green light. It might be noted that a similar would have been seen in approximately this location at 25/0451Z Feb 56, which coincidently was the approximate position of the original UFOB.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-B, 4602d AISS                REPORT NO. 38-UFOB -1-56    Part Four    PAGE 13    of 13    PAGES

COMMENTS of the Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer the phenomena observed on 22/0615Z Feb 56 at Hampton-Sydney, Virginia was due to the brilliant color scintillation arising from celestial bodies, Sirius and Procryon when viewed below an angle of 30° with the horizon.

a. The fact is generally known among astronomers that the two stars mentioned readily appear sparkling army of bright-colored lights when viewed on a clear night below an angle of 30° with the horizon.

b. The persisting nature of the UFOB negates the chance of its having been a balloon. The pertinence and complete absence of sound further negates the chance that it could have been an aircraft.

c. The coincidence of Sirius and Procryon having been in the approximate location of the UFOB for the duration of the incident suggests misinterpretation on the part of the observers.

(1) At this point it might be mentioned that if the observer had no special to continually focus his portable telescope, within a very brief period of time due to the earth's rotation, the apparatus would have been out of focus and the number of illusions might have appeared on the lens approaching the fantastic.

d. The relative age of the observers and the fact that none had ever before viewed celestial or star phenomena except casually and had no knowledge or identity such as "flying" upon the suggestion of something in the group of an identity much as "flying".

e. The results of and/or "comment" associated with the UFOB by two of the observers either illness or an excited observer or possibly delirium for its existence.

f. The opinion of the astronomers interviewed was unanimous that the phenomena when first seen solely consisted of Sirius and Procryon as viewed below 30° with the horizon.

[Signature of John D. Taylor, Jr., Major, USAF, Officer-in-Charge]

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was caused by the stars Sirius and Procryon.

I. SOURCE: Mr. [redacted]
    Address: Hampton-Sydney College, Hampton-Sydney, Virginia
             (GeghF GJWI 3914).

    Age: 20
    Occupation: Student
    Qualifications: 20/20 vision, uncorrected. Amateur astronomer.

II. RELIABILITY. Good. SOURCE was contacted personally.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 22 Feb 56 (0615Z) from the campus of Hampton-Sydney College, he had observed an unusual object in the sky which was red, free, flickering and seemed to be moving in the direction of SW. SOURCE's first impression was that the object in question was a star, however in view of its unusual "color-changing" characteristics SOURCE discounted this identity. According to SOURCE, object was first seen at approximately 300 with the horizon and gradually this angle seemed to decrease.

On observing the object through a 50-power portable telescope, SOURCE believed that it was a little larger than a regular star, however the size gradually diminished in his opinion. SOURCE stated that the object was not a "shooting star", but that its movement had been very slow and definite.

SOURCE would not say that there had either been smoke or an exhaust associated with the object, however object created the impression of having been "extremely well defined" and of "normal and definitely unlike any present day aircraft". As to the assumption in the latter statement that this object too was an aircraft, SOURCE would not commit himself but did definitely not identify the object as an aircraft.

SOURCE further stated that there appeared to be a bright cone-shaped object behind the original UFO, but that not been visible all the time.

The condition of the sky at the time and place of the sighting was clear with unlimited visibility.

No photographs were taken of the UFOB.

After viewing the object for approximately 45 minutes, SOURCE finally lost sight of it.

I. SOURCE: Mr. [redacted]
   Address: Hampton-Sidney College, Hampton-Sidney, Virginia
   Age: 18
   Occupation: Student
   Qualifications: 20/20 vision.

II. RELIABILITY: Good. SOURCE was contacted personally.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE had been told about an unusual object in the sky by friends and upon looking in a southwesterly direction where they were viewing it, SOURCE spotted a dull object which seemed to be changing colors from red to blue to yellow. The time was 22/0652 and the object was approximately 30° from the horizon.

SOURCE viewed the object for approximately 30 minutes during which time he felt it had changed in size from the size of a half-dollar until it diminished to the size of a pinpoint.

SOURCE stated that he had seen no exhaust coming from the object. Object seemed at times to vibrate and at all times appeared to radiate an extreme brightness, other times would appear to flicker out.

SOURCE glanced at the object through the telescope (same apparatus as mentioned in Part I) and from seeing the object disappear suddenly through the telescope, SOURCE concluded that object made no marking as would a plane flying at a high rate of speed. (See Part IV) Object appeared to move up and down at times.

SOURCE did not remember having seen protrusions on the surface of the object. There was no sound associated with the UFOB.

SOURCE could not remember having heard any sound of aircraft in the area at any time during the sighting.

SOURCE viewed object for a period of 1 hour and 15 minutes.
