Report of Sighting

At 0915 on 30 April 1952 a Mr. of Coldwater, Ohio, called ATIC. He reported that at 1940 EST on 29 April he and three other people observed an unidentified aerial object.

The object was first seen directly overhead. It drifted NW and disappeared in the distance. It was at an angle of elevation of about 30° when it disappeared.

The object appeared to be disc shaped 'standing on edge'. It was the color of cherry red hot iron. It appeared to be about 1/8 the size of a full moon. The source thought that it was drifting faster than a balloon could drift.

Layton winds were:
NE 20,000
NE 25,000
NE 35,000
NE 45,000
N 65,000

Selfridge winds were:
NE 40,000 47
N 45,000 21
N 50,000 17

Dayton balloon drifted SW - 210°. Winds shifting S. Could have been drifting North. They were not sure of definite burst.

Selfridge last report was 67,000' but no record at AMP ATO of definite burst.

Could have been 'piball' which are very difficult to track.
