Unidentified Flying Objects Sighted Near Batesville, Mississippi, 17 July 1952

Date of Information: 17 July 1952
Source: Lt Colonel Walter J. Winfield, USAF
Location: Batesville, Mississippi

Frank M. Allen, Lt Colonel, USAF was flying at approximately 2,000 feet when he observed a bright light which appeared to be following his aircraft. Colonel Allen circled the area for several minutes and the light followed his aircraft until he headed back to base. The light appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet.

Two or three round unidentified flying objects were sighted by Captain J. Wm. Lyons, who was in a C-45 aircraft. Captain Lyons reported that the objects were observed to make a turn and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. The objects were egg-shaped and seemed to be reflecting bright lights. The objects were in sight for approximately 10 seconds and then disappeared. One object was observed to be at an altitude of 11,000 feet and was circular in appearance.
