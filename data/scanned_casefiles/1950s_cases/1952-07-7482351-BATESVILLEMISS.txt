1. Unidentified flying objects were visually observed from the ground at Bates-
ville, Mississippi 17 July 1952. First sighted 0107CST and observed for period of
approximately 30 minutes by two State Highway Patrolmen.

2. Reported as two or three round objects, approximately 100 feet in diameter,
looking like blue fluorescent lights. Estimated altitude of one object 11,000 feet,
exhibiting altitude of 5,000 to 15,000 feet.

3. Objects at first seemed to stand still, and then had a gradual back and forth
(North and then South) movement. No speed or sound reported.

4. Weather in the area at the time of the sighting was:
a. Broken clouds at 10,000 to 12,000 feet with an overcast above at 20,000
to 25,000 feet, visibility unrestricted.
b. Winds aloft reported: 3,000 to 5,000 feet, from 160° at 20 to 25 knots
at 5,000 to 25,000 feet, from 160° at 15 to 20 knots

5. Witnesses were J. D. Watts and J. L. Coggins of the Mississippi State Highway
Patrol.

6. Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Center (CAA) reported that B-29 aircraft
were refueling in air in the vicinity. Hunter Air Force Base, Savannah, Georgia,
advised that B-29 types from that base use white spot lights, in addition to standard
navigation lights. Then refueling in air was at night. There was no position reports to
indicate an aircraft might have been involved.

7. No physical evidence of sighting reported, and no interception or identification taken.

8. Information was received by Maxwell Flight Service Center from Memphis Air
Route Traffic Control Center 0107CST 17 July. Teletype PXOBSPT was submitted by
Maxwell Flight Service Center 0717Z 17 July.

Comments of Preparing Officer:

1. The sound of B29 aircraft refueling overhead should have been audible to
observers, unless covered by other noise, such as automobile, radio, etc. Stationary
appearance at first sighting, and absence of movement other than gradual back and forth
shifting, for period of 30 minutes, tends to discount probability aircraft spotlight
diffused by clouds.

2. Method of transmission of information from observers to Memphis Air Route
Traffic Control Center was not reported.
