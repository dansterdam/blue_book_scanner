On 17/18 October 1956 within a three (3) hour period, commencing at 17/22172, two (2) different tracks of unidentified slow flying objects were carried by the 633d ACGW Squadron, Wheelus Air Base Libya. F-860 aircraft made radar contact with the objects and made repeated intercepts with the F-1 weapons system through all phases to Splain without any visual contact made by the F-860 pilots. No satisfactory explanation of these occurrences could be determined. This incident is considered important because of the positive and repeated radar indications of an object in the air.

1. Description:
   1. Objects were never sighted visually. Both gave a bright return on ground and airborne radar.

2. Description of course of objects:
   d. Flight description and maneuvers:
      (1) The first object was picked up on the ground radar scope at 17/
      22172 October 1950, at NJQD 5047. The object maintained an approximate altitude of
      9,000 feet and held a heading of 210° until 2303z at which time, and at NJQD 2805,
      the heading was changed to 170°. Ground radar contact was lost once just prior to
      the change of heading and final contact was lost at 2303z.

      (2) The second object was picked up on the ground radar scope at 17/
      23172 October at NJQD 0739. The object's initial altitude was 5,400 ft. Altitude
      at disappearance was approximately 3,800 feet.

   7. Weather:
      a. Pilots stated that there was no ceiling, a visibility of ten (10)
      nautical miles and a ten (10) knot wind from the North.

   8. During this season migratory birds are flying South across the
      Mediterranean.

   9. Interception and Identification action taken:
      a. Two (2) F-86D aircraft were diverted to location of first object.
      Both aircraft made radar contact with the object with the B-4 weapons system and

proceeded through to Splash with no visual contact at anytime. When the unknown object
made its heading change to 170, ground radar contact was lost momentarily.

    b.  Two (2) F-86D aircraft were diverted to the second object. At 23572 
F/Blue 1, flying at 5,000 feet, made contact on a heading of 050° F/Blue 1 
was two (2) nautical miles from the target at the time of the initial contact. At 
23582 F/Blue 1 got a Judy on a heading of 050° one mile from target. At 23592 F/Blue 
1 got a Splash. At this time the object and fighter were 35 nautical miles from the 
ground radar on a bearing of 049°. F/Blue 1 did not get a Tally-ho.

    (1) F/Blue 1, flying at 5,000 feet, got a radar contact at 23592 on 
a heading of 100° as a distance of four (4) nautical miles bearing 042° at 32 miles 
from ground radar. F/Blue 2 had a Judy when he was 32 nautical miles from the ground 
radar at 047°, a Splash 34 nautical miles at 050° from the ground radar. He did not 
have a Tally-ho.

    (3) The last two intercepts were as follows: F/Blue 1 got a contact 
at 00462 two miles from target on a heading of 085°, (bearing from ground radar 029° 
at 28 nautical miles) a Judy one (1) mile from target on a heading of 085°, (bearing 
from ground radar 030° at 29 nautical miles) and a Splash at 00472 (bearing from

ground radar 035° at 30 nautical miles). F/Blue 2 got a contact two (2) miles from
the target on a bearing of 090° (bearing from ground radar 029° at 28 nautical miles)
and a Splash at C0462 (bearing from ground radar 035° at 30 nautical miles). This
Splash was the last radar contact with the object by say type radar. The altitude
of both fighters on these two (2) passes was 30,000 feet. Neither fighter achieved
a Tally-ho. Due to low fuel conditions both aircraft were released for landing.

(4) F/Blue 1 stated that just before each Splash the fighter aircraft would be just above, just below, or between clouds, but never in a cloud. The
fighter scope return was described as very bright. No evasive action was taken by
either of the objects at any time.

10. There was no other air traffic in the area.

11. Comments of Preparing Officer:
    a. In view of the available data, no definite explanation for these
objects can be made. One possible explanation is that the objects are flocks of
migratory birds. However, it is considered unlikely, in view of the 9,000 foot
altitude of one of the objects plus the probable that repeated passes of the
fighter aircraft would be likely to change the course of the flock or disrupt it
altogether. Too, the likelihood of the E-4 system maintaining lock all the way

a. Because of speed of movement and weather conditions a temperature
inversion is not considered probable cause of indications.

TO: TDEN/Sgt Moody

The fact that the visibility was 10 miles and the pilot saw nothing (visually) when he had closed to less than a mile is an indication that there was no material target; it seems most likely that some sudden change in the atmospheric characteristics - not necessarily temperature inversion as such - may have caused the return. Birds can give radar returns, but we concur that birds would be unlikely to maintain a given course, ( or remain in the vicinity of aircraft) for so long a period of time.
