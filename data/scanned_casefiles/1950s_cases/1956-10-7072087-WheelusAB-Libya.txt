2. LOCATION: WHEELUS AB, LIBYA
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1645Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION:
   Ground-Visual
   Ground-Radar
   Air-Visual
   Air-Intercept Radar
5. PHOTOS: X Yes
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-4 minutes
7. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two distinct objects, bright and shiny, were observed at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet. Visibility was excellent with no ceiling and visibility up to 250 miles. The objects appeared to be traveling at a speed of about 3000 mph, and made several changes in direction. Final contact was lost at 0650Z. Ground radar and air intercept radar tracked the objects.
11. COMMENTS: Insufficient data for evaluation.

The image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document related to a UFO incident that occurred near Wheelus Air Base in Libya on 17/18 October 1956.

Country: Libya
ATIC #: 103680
AF #: 6301-56
Rpt #: 13724 Air Base Wing Combat
Agency/Units Concerned: 
D.R.: October 29, 1956
D.E.: October 17-18, 1956 

The report describes that two (2) bright targets were detected by radar of the 633rd Radar Squadron and 431st Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Wheelus Air Base. The objects were tracked by radar but no visual contact was made by the pilots. The incident is considered important due to the positive and repeated radar indications of an object in the area.

RPL #: IR-1-56

Ground radar 035° at 30 nautical miles: F/Blue 2 got a contact two (2) miles from this F/Blue 2 at 050° for 2-3 minutes. Neither fighter aircraft was observed by radar. The altitude of both fighter aircraft was stated as 38,000 feet. The last radar contact with the object by any type radar. The altitude of the object was 46,000 feet. Neither fighter aircraft returned. The fighter scope return was described as very bright. No evasive action was taken by 10-. There was no other air traffic in the area.

Comments of Evaluating Officer: No definite explanation for these objects can be made. One possible explanation is that the objects are flocks of birds, in view of the 9,000 foot altitude or one of the objects plus the probability that repeated passes of the fighter aircraft would be likely to change the course of the flock or disrupt it. However, the likelihood of the 84 system maintaining lock all the way.

Libya: Through a splash signal on a target of this nature is considered improbable.
Because of speed of movement and weather conditions a temperature inversion is not considered probable cause of indications.

TO: TDDD/Sgt Moody

The fact that the visibility was 10 miles and the pilot saw nothing (visually) when he had closed on the lighted area so rapidly, it seems most significant. This disparity between visual sightings and radar presentations is a frequent characteristic - not necessarily temperature inversion as such - may have caused the returns. Birds would be unlikely to maintain a given course, ( or remain in the vicinity of an object) for so long a period of time.
