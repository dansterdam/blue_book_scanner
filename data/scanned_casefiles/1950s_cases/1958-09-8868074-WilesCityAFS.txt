8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
On radar obj appeared as an a/c
paint. Obj appeared to orbit. Radar
contact lost when interceptor plane
approached within 3 miles. Visually
there appeared to be 2 objs, size of
a quarter with 2 miles separation, gree
white and red flashing lights, stationary with possible 10-20 knot
orbit.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Possibly Balloon
Probably Balloon

Was Aircraft
Possibly Aircraft
Probably Aircraft

Was Astronomical
Possibly Astronomical
Probably Astronomical (Y/N)

Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Unknown

11. COMMENTS
One of the objs was probably
a balloon that was in the area.
The others were probably caused
by anomalous propagation or
ground reflections. Possible
astronomical body as visual
sighting.

SUBJECT: Evaluation of UFOB Reports

TO: AFCIN-4E4     FROM: AFCIN-4E1     DATE: 2 Feb 59     COMMENT NO. 1
                                        AFCIN-4214/W, Philheimer/jc

1. These four messages report radar sightings from three (3) stations in the same general area over a period of a little over four (4) hours. It is probable that the same object or phenomenon caused the four different radar sightings. The object appeared to orbit in a relatively small area. In addition, a possible weather balloon was reported in the area by a weather station.

2. Although fighters were unable to verify an object, the possibility exists that a weather balloon could have caused the radar paints. Some other cause such as weather or anomalous propagation phenomena is also a possibility.
