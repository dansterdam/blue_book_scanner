Case 162, Cincinnati, O., Aug. 15, 1956—Bill Jones, amateur astronomer, with witness while taking in late Blue Ads north of Cincinnati, saw two bright objects.

Time was about 9 p.m. The sky was clear with limited. Bill Jones, there was unusual phase activity. Suddenly one distinct object caught his eye about 15 degrees of the east horizon. The object was "extremely bright, like polished metal and was winged, large, like a blot." As it moved speedily through the sky, going south, it assumed the appearance more like "an arc welder's torch, almost blush white." At no time could Jones or witness or any appearance, nor did the object cause sound. While watching the object Jones then saw another similar object come in view in the west about 30 degrees of horizon. It also looked like a red welder's torch and made no sound. Both objects disappeared into infinity and Jones was sure they were not jet. Confirming Jones CRIFO later learned that the same object (one of them) was seen moving over Cold Spring, Ky., at about the same time. Object was heading south, looking like "an arc welder's torch."

Case 194, Willsboro, N.Y., Aug. 15 (and earlier) 1956 - At least a score of Essex Court residents contend they have seen a UFO hovering over Lake Champlain. Mark Berman, one of the witnesses, describes what he saw: "It was a round, basketball-like object that glowed with an orange color. It appeared to bob around in the sky with a weaving motion." He said he had sighted the object three times at about 10 p.m., the most recent observation on August 15. Other summertime residents said they had seen the "round glow" four times earlier in the month, three of them on consecutive nights. One witness said the light cast from the object was bright enough to form a golden-hued path on the surface of the lake.

Case 195, Santa Monica, Cal, Aug. 16, 1956—At 1:42 a.m. two police officers saw a ball of white light, with some orange in it, floating overhead. It looked as if it were being turned on and off, they said. Said the Los Angeles Examiner, fifteen minutes later, the police received another call, reporting a similar light.

The following article appeared in the Pieksät newspaper HURVUDSTADS-
BLADET on 20 August 1956:

"Flying Saucer, Kuopio, Sunday. Late on Saturday night a strange
light phenomena was sighted in the skies over Kuopio. The light
was visible for more than two hours and finally disappeared in a
cloud. The ball of light which approached Kuopio at 2100 looked
exactly like the phenomena seen in Kuopio during Midsummer."

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

This report is being submitted in order to keep your office informed
of all reported light phenomena in our area. We have no other available

2 Navy Men Ride "Sky Hook"
Balloon To 8-Mile Altitude

Special to The Journal Herald
And The New York Journal

WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 - Two
Navy balloonists today floated
nearly 200 miles from Minneapolis
to, Stevens Point, Wis., at an altitude of nearly eight miles in the
first test of a man-carrying "skyhook" plastic balloon.

The balloon was launched by
the Naval Research Office and
General Mills, Inc., from International Airport, Minneapolis, at
9:18 a.m. Chicago time, and
landed at 1:30 p.m. eight miles
south of the Wisconsin city.

The balloonists were Lt. Cmdr.
M. D. Ross, project officer for
the "strato-lab" program, and Lt.
Cmdr. M. L. Lewis, Navy air liaison officer, who formerly served
on the Chicago Naval Research
office. They made the unprecedented ride in an open air gondola
strung between a balloon and
research program.

The Navy said in five two-balloon flights, it took to the air in one of the huge plastic
balloons, probably the largest in
the world, some of which have
reached an altitude of 117,000

feet with 400 pounds of instruments but no passengers.

On today's flight, the "skyhook" balloon reached 40,000
feet in a flight in which no record was attempted. The world's
altitude record for balloons was
set nearly 21 years ago by two
Army Air Corps flyers who
reached 72,395 feet.

The Navy research office said
today's flight will open a series
of research exploratory ascensions
aimed at reaching up to 100,000
feet with human operators to
conduct studies in astronomy,
aeromedicine, aerology, meteorology, atmospheric physics, and
science. The human observers
will be able to operate precision
cameras and other instruments
for several hours at a time.

Pittsburg, Pennsylvania

Case 186, Pittsburgh, Pa., Aug. 11, 1956—Said the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph: "Mrs. Florence Stauffer reported watching a 'bright steel-gray ship' for more than two hours Saturday morning. She said, 'I don't imagine things. I really saw this thing.' Said Mrs. Stauffer, 'It apparently came from the direction of East Liberty, hovered about for two hours and then disappeared in a westerly direction. The object was circular and real bright.'"

Case 187, Parkersburg, W. Va., Aug. 12, 1956—According to the Parkersburg Sentinel the UFO was seen at 9:30 p.m. by reliable observers. A Sentinel reporter and his family had a 15-second view before the mystery object disappeared. The object looked round with an "orange-silver" color considerably brighter than the stars. Size and altitude could not be determined. It appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and made weird, un-aircraft-like movements. There was no sound. The observer said it came from the north and looked like a shooting star at first. Then it darted to one side and went east at a high rate of speed. A request by the Sentinel asking for verification of the sighting brought results. Said the newspaper, "At least three residents reported seeing the mysterious aerial object." All three witnesses said the object looked round and appeared to be "orange-silver" in color. One observer said at first she thought it was the moon, but saw it moving very fast. Still later reports confirming the object came from Vienna, Dieppe, Williamstown and Harrisville.¹⁰

Case 188, Cortland and Ithaca, N.Y., August 14, 1956—
In a letter to CRIFPO, Lynn Strauff writes in part, "Around
2 a.m. a very clear night my brother, age 11 and myself,
age 27 were on a hill overlooking Cortland and at a point
which should put Cortland in the southwest. We saw two
faint reddish objects move slowly from the south, about
a half hour apart. There was no sound or blinking lights
from the unknowns except one flicked off its lights for a

matter of seconds and then came on brighter than before.
The it moved out of visual right. The classes came at
3:30 a.m. when my brother and I started home. All of a
sudden we saw six lights in a long line spread apart. We
saw them move into this formation and then start to move
slowly toward Ithaca. These six lights were much brighter
than our earlier observations. They looked like stars, but
every so often one would move clear to the next one to
it. Unless anyone were watching they sky as we were
these lights could easily be mistaken for a formation of
stars but we know they were not. I'll swear to it. This
sight certainly puts a different light on saucers for me."

Ed: A possible tie-in to Case 188 is a report from Wm. Hartford.
Said in item in the Hartford Times: "A ground observer and low
readers spotted seeing high heading west, shortly after 9 p.m."
In a later letter Strauff said that the line of lights seemed to bend
more or less while. He added the there seemed to be intelligence be-
hind the lights.
