The text in the document is as follows:

No Case (Information Only)
13 August 1956
Cincinnati, Ohio

Case 18a, Class 22, 8 Aug 13 1956 - 2246 Jones Jones watching a clear sky sighted two objects which looked like stars, but were moving. One object was moving slightly faster than the other. Both objects appeared to be approximately the same size and brightness. The objects made no sound. Both objects disappeared into infinity and Jones was sure they were not conventional aircraft. The objects were sighted for approximately 5 minutes. After the objects disappeared, Jones continued to watch the area of the sky for about 3O minutes but saw no more objects. It was assumed the appearance was that of a welders torch. As to the identity of the objects, Jones could furnish no further information.

While watching the object Jones then saw another similar object appear in the same part of the sky about 20 minutes or so after the first two had disappeared. This third object also disappeared into infinity and made no sound. Both the initial two objects and the third object disappeared into infinity and Jones was sure they were not conventional aircraft.

There was no moon and the objects were silhouetted against a clear sky and looking like "welders torch". The objects were first seen about Cold Spring, Ky, at about 1025 pm and were seen for about 5 minutes.

Unfortunately, this page of the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The document appears to be a typed report describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred on August 15, 1956 in Willsboro, New York. The report details the observations made by local residents regarding a UFO that was hovering over Lake Champlain, describing it as a "small, spherical, dish-like object that glowed with an orange color."

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY) 10 AUG 1956 MINNEAPOLIS, STEVENS POINT, WIS.

2 Navy Men Ride "Sky Hook" Balloon To 8-Mile Altitude

Two Navy men today floated nearly 200 miles from Minneapolis, Minn., to a point south of Stevens Point, Wis., in a "sky-hook" plastic balloon at an altitude of nearly eight miles in the first test of a new carrier-type "sky-hook" plastic balloon.

The balloon was launched by General Mills, Inc., from International Airport, Minneapolis, at 1:15 p.m. and landed at 3:30 p.m. eight miles south of the Wisconsin city.

The balloonists were Lt. Cmdr. William D. Ross, project officer for the "Stratoscale" program, and Lt. Cdr. M. L. Lewis, Navy jet pilot who made the first full-scale test of the balloon.

On today's flight, the Stratoscale" balloon reached an altitude of nearly 40,000 feet in a flight in which several low-altitude records were attempted. The world's altitude record for balloons was reached by the U.S. Army Air Corps Flyers who reached 72,395 feet.

Case 186, Pittsburgh, Pa., Aug 11, 1956 - Said the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph Mrs. Florence Scalise of Emerson said she spotted an object shaped like a "ship" for more than two hours on Saturday morning. She said, "I don't imagine things. I really saw this thing." Said Mrs. Scalise, "It hovered about for two hours and then disappeared in a westerly direction. The object was circular and real bright."

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

No Case (Information Only)	12 August 1956
Parkersburg, West Virginia

Case 187, Parkersburg, W. Va., Aug. 12, 1956 - According to the Parkersburg Sentinel the UFO was seen by a Sentinel reporter and his family had a 15-second view before the mystery object disappeared. The object looked round with a bright glow around the size and altitude could not be determined. It appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed with no sound. The observer said it came from the north and looked like a shooting star. They tried to trace it into the horizon but it seemed to disappear suddenly. At the request by the Sentinel asking for verification of the sighting brought results. Said the newspaper, "As least five residents reported seeing the same object moving across the sky. All three witnesses said the object looked round and appeared to be orange-silver in color. One observer said at first she thought it was a plane but as it moved closer she could see it moving very fast. Still later reports confirming the object came from Vienna, Belpre, Williamstown and Harrisville."

NO Case (Information Only)
14 August 1956
Cortland & Ithaca, N.Y.

Case 188, Cortland and Ithaca, N.Y. August 14, 1956 - In a letter to CRIFO, Lynn Strutt writes in part, "Around 3:30 a.m. my brother and I saw 2 bright blue-green lights, in a formation over Cortland and at a point about 200 yards southwest of Cortland in the southwest. We saw two beams of lights shoot out of these objects about a half hour apart. There was no sound or blinking lights from the unknown objects except one flicked off its lights for a matter of seconds." There came a brighter flash than before which seemed to burst out of the visual sight. They became more distinct at 3:30 a.m. when my brother and I started home. All of a sudden we saw the lights in a long line spread apart. They moved across the sky and then started to move slowly toward Ithaca. These six lights were much brighter than our earlier observation. They looked like stars, but they were moving. As they neared Ithaca, they seemed to disappear one by one to the next one. Unless anyone was watching the sky for we were, these lights could easily be mistaken for a plane. An interesting thing about this sighting is that it certainly puts a different light on saucers as being merely "Conventional aircraft, meteorological or astronomical phenomena."
