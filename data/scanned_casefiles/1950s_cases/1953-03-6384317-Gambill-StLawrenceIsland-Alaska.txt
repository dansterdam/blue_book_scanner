ATIC DOCUMENT: 120745, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska

UNCLASSIFIED

This report contains the observations of two sources relative to an unidentified light observed at Gamble, St. Lawrence Island, 24 Mar 53.

Source was located approximately 1 miles East of the village of Gambell and stated that he observed a flickering light which initially appeared bright white and then changed to various shades of red and orange. The light was observed at a true bearing of 323° from the observer and at an initial altitude of 5° above the horizon. Duration of sighting was 45 minutes, after which the light faded below the horizon. Source stated that a similar light was observed on 25 and 26 Mar 53 at approx the same location.

ATIC COMMENT: Due to the bearing of the unidentified object, its gradual fade-out below the horizon, and the fact that it was observed on two other occasions in the same month, it is probable that this light was the astronomical body Venus which is in that relative position from the point of observation.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

25 MARCH 1953
CARIBBEAN SEA

HY DRO (CAPTAIN) BULLETIN

SUN PHENOMENON
CARIBBEAN SEA

Second Officer A. Le Fevre, of the French SS. Caraibe, Capt. A. Juvin, Master, reports observing a peculiar formation around the sun, which he classified as Bishop's Ring, on March 25, 1953, at 1600 G. M. T., in lat. 14°16' N., lon. 75°40' W. The observer saw two irised circles surrounding the sun. The inner circle, radius about 12°, was quite clear and distinct and the outer circle, radius about 12°, was quite clear and distinct.

Weather fair with scattered showers, wind east force 5, barometer 29.96 inches, air temperature 79° F., sea temperature 79° F.

NOTE BY HYDRO.- BISHOP'S RING: A corona around the sun usually with its outer edge of reddish color. It is probably due to particles of dust in the air, as it is seen after all the great volcanic eruptions. Was named after Rev. Sereno P. Bishop of Honolulu, who first described them after the Krakatao eruption in 1883.
