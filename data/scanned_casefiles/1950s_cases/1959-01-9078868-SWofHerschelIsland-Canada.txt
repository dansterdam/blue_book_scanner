K. THE INFORMATION WAS REPORTED VERBALLY TO CAPTAIN DONALD R SANDVIG, AD 15701781 THE DATA CENTER DUTY OFFICER STATION. DEW LINE AT 1842 23 JANUARY 1959. THE DURATION OF THE SIGHTING AND LACK OF MOVEMENT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS THE MOON.
L. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, MATERIAL OR PHOTOGRAPHS NONE. R AIR DIVISION INTELLIGENCE COMMENTS. REFERENCE ITEM K ABOVE. FURTHER CHECK WITH STATION BARGAIN PERSONNEL. INDICATES MOON WAS IN EXACT POSITION PARTIALLY HIDDEN BY CLOUD COVER JUST ABOVE HORIZON. DUE TO LENGTH OF TIME OBSERVED AND OBJECT BEING STATIONARY IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS IS NOT A MAN MADE OBJECT.
