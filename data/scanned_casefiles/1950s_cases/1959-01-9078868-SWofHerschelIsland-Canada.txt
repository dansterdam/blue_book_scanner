FLYING OBJECT REPORT:

A. 1. SHAPE ROUND, FLAT BOTTOM. 2. SIZE 1/2 OF ORANGE AT ARMS LENGTH. 3. COLOR ORANGE. 4. NUMBER 1 OBJECT. 5. FORMATION NOT APPLICABLE. 6. FEATURES NO DISCERNABLE FEATURES OTHER THAN SIZE AND COLOR. 7. TAIL OR TRAIL NONE. 8. SOUND NONE. 9. OTHER PER PERTINENT DATA APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY, WAS ON A TRUE BEARING OF 319 DEGREES FROM BAR-1 AND APPEARED TO BE 30 OR 40 MILES DISTANCE.

B. 1. CALL DO ATTENTION BY MAN TAKING WEATHER OBSERVATIONS. 2. ANGLE OF ELEVATION ABOVE SURFACE 3 DEGREES OR 4 DEGREES. 3. ANGLE OF ELEVATION WHEN DISAPPEARED 3 DEGREES OR 4 DEGREES. 4. FLIGHT PATH APPEARED STATIONARY BUT WHEN WATCHED STEADY THERE SEEMED TO BE A SLIGHT MOVEMENT. 5. DISAPPEARED SUDDENLY (DID NOT FADE OR MOVE). 6. HOW LONG DISCERNABLE 20 MINUTES.

C. 1. THIS WAS A SOUND VISUAL OBSERVATION. 2. NO OPTICAL AIDS WERE USED. 3. NOT APPLICABLE.

D. 1. 231800Z TO 231820Z. 2. OBSERVED AT DAWN. E. LOCATION OF OBSERVERS 69 DEGREES 35 MINUTES 53 SECONDS NORTH 142 DEGREES 11 MINUTES 20 SECONDS WEST. F. OBSERVERS ACCOUNT OF WEATHER CLEAR, A FEW SCATTERED CLOUDS. ARMAIN STATION WEATHER REPORT OF WINDS 6000 FEET 060-15 KNOTS. 10000350/25 KNOTS. 16000330-50 KNOTS. 20000330-45 KNOTS. 30000020-40 KNOTS. 50000310-20 KNOTS. CEILING UNLIMITED.

THUNDERSTORMS NONE. H. METEROLOGICAL OR ASTRONOMICAL ACTIVITY NONE.

I. INTERCEPT OR IDENTIFICATION NONE.

J. LOCATION OF AIR TRAFFIC AT THE SCANDINAVIAN AIRLINES SAS 988 WAS PASSING FROM WEST NORTH WEST TO NORTH NORTH WEST OF BAR-1 AT APPROXIMATELY 65 MILES AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.

K. THE INFORMATION WAS REPORTED VERBALLY TO CAPTAIN DONALD R SANDVIG, AO 1036711 THE DATA CENTER DUTY OFFICER AT BARMAIN STATION, DEW LINE AT 18402 23 JANUARY 1959. THE DURATION OF THE SIGHTING AND LACK OF MOVEMENT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS THE MOON.

L. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, MATERIAL OR PHOTOGRAPHS NONE. 11 AIR DIVISION INTELLIGENCE COMMENTS. REFERENCE ITEM K ABOVE. FURTHER CHECK WITH STATION BARMAIN PERSONNEL INDICATES MOON WAS IN EXACT POSITION PARTIALLY HIDDEN BY CLOUD COVER JUST ABOVE HORIZON, DUE TO LENGTH OF TIME OBSERVED AND OBJECT BEING STATIONARY IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS IS NOT A MAN MADE OBJECT.
