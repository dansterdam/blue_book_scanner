DETAILS:

1. Investigation predicated upon verbal report of Captain, AO----- 4675th Air Base Squadron, Hanscom AF Base, Bedford, Mass., who advised that on 24 July 1951 he had observed an unconventional aircraft in flight over the area of Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

AT BEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS

2. On 14 August 1951, the writer interviewed Captain ---- Base Operations Officer, Hanscom AF Base. It was disclosed that on 24 July 1951, was driving north on main U. S. Highway No. 1 toward the toll bridge at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He was accompanied by Cpl ---- Hanscom AF Base. (At approximately 1910 hours, EST, he observed an object pass over the toll bridge leading into Portsmouth. The object was traveling from east to west at an estimated elevation of 1,000 to 2,000 feet, and at a speed of 800 to 1,000 mph. The description given by ---- is as follows:

A long tube with a fin construction on one end, 100 to 200 feet long, with a thickness of 1/5 the length. The object resembled fused glass, being grayish to invisible in color. The entire surface was covered with black polka dotted spots. There was no exhaust or vapor trail, excepting a small resembling a very weak rainbow. There was no sound emanating from the object. The sighted object was in view for approximately 20 seconds, at which point it disappeared very quickly, as though it had gone into a cloud bank.

---- advised that he is familiar with the contents of AFOIN-CG-1 Letter, dated 8 September 1950, dealing with the reporting of sighting of unconventional aircraft through military channels through Air Materiel Command. Steps have been taken to procure a teletype sequence of weather conditions over Portsmouth, New Hampshire, at the time of the alleged sighting, and will prepare the standard AF Form 112, in accordance with cited AFOIN Letter.

3. Cpl ---- AF ---- 4675th Air Base Squadron, Hanscom AF Base was interviewed with regard to his observations surrounding SUBJECT Aircraft. Informant stated that he was with Capt ---- on the evening of 24 July 1951 and that he saw a long tube-like object such as the one described by Capt ----. Further stated that he could supply no more information than the Captain and that he was relying on ---- judgment as to the height and speed of the object in question. Informant's knowledge and experience with military aircraft is negligible and there is nothing in his background that would lend credence to his ability to estimate height and speed of an exceptionally fast moving object.

Overall color, almost colorless resembling fused glass. Ereyda to Arvidala coast Tanangarst. No left no exhaust trail or vapor trail, except a swath resembling a very weak rainbow. This rainbow was between our position and the sun making a reflection impossible. Estimated speed was very roughly 800-1000 FPH. No sound involved. No maneuvers, it was in level flight, travelling from east to west. It disappeared as quickly as it came into sight. It was clear out and no clouds visible in sky.

STATEMENT OF OBSERVER OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT

On Tuesday, 24 Jul 51, while travelling north on U.S. Route 1, near Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in the company of Captain USAR, I saw an unusual object in the sky. This object was travelling in from the sea in a westerly direction and I would estimate its altitude at between 500 and 1000 feet.

Although I could make no estimate regarding the speed of the object, I can say that it was travelling at a considerably greater rate of speed than any other type of aircraft that I have ever seen. Although the object was not well defined, its shape resembled that of a large hot-dog, tapering eligibly toward the rear and perhaps four or five times as long as it was high.

The object was in my sight for between five and ten seconds and then seemed to disappear from sight, as if into a cloud bank, although there were no clouds in that area at that time.

The time of the sighting was 1910 EST.
