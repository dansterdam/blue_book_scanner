10001 S531 ATTN+J-2 REF 10D01 01-2824 UFOB RPT. REEVALUATION OF
INITIAL RPT INDICATES POSSIBILITY THAT UFOB MAY HAVE BEEN METEOR
PASSING INTO EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE IN NORMAL ARCING TRAJECTORY. OPTICAL
ILLUSION OF A PATH PARALLEL TO THE EARTH'S SURFACE COULD RESULT FROM
METEOR COMING ALMOST DIRECTLY TOWARDS OBSERVER FROM A POINT LOW ON
THE HORIZON. THE SHORT HORIZ PATH WITH ABRUPT TERMINATION DESCRIBED
BY OBSR CORR TO HOW SUCH A TRACK WOULD APPEAR.
