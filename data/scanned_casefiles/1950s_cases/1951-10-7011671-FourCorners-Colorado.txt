On 30 October 1951 while in the company of Bill Johnson who resides in Littleton, Colorado, we were in the Four Corners area which comprises the boundaries of Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. We were in the Navajo Valley just outside of Goulding's Trading Post on a painting trip.

At about 1930 I first observed, and called attention, what we believed to be a shooting star. It traveled more an approximate zenith of ninety degrees from north to south by west toward the state of Nevada.

It first appeared as white, and then as it described in arc, it showed red and the core glowed as a neon tube and was a brilliant green. It then just seemed to disappear.

Then I both remarked on how brilliant it had been, and then returned to the task of eating camp. I never gave it much further thought because we hadn't heard of any other sightings and we hadn't read a paper for four days.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION
Incident report received on 14 November 1951, from Sgt. [redacted] Co. "C", 1st Alaska R. C. Scout Bn, Barrow, Alaska, contains the following information:

On 21 October 1951, between 1530 and 1600 hours a light, similar to that of a spotlight, was seen 1/2 mile Northeast of Point Barrow. Observation of the light lasted for approximately one minute and appeared to be coming from a point just above the horizon. Because of the 18-mile relation to the horizon, the observer believed it came from a vessel leaving the vicinity of Point Barrow.
