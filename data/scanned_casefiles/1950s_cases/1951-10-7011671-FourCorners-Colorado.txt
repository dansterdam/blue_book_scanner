AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

AREA            Four Corners, Colorado
DATE OF OBSERVATION    10 November 1951
SOURCE            Reliable civilian observer
TYPE OF OBSERVATION    Sighting of unidentified objects
SUMMARY: About 1230, 10 October 1951, what was thought to be a scouting aircraft was observed over the Four Corners area of Colorado. It was described as a bright silver-like object, flying in a NNW to SSE direction at a very high altitude. The object appeared to be traveling at very high speed and was observed for a period of 35 minutes by several persons. No sound was heard. The object maintained a straight course and showed no deviation from its flight path. It was also observed by an experienced pilot who gave the same description. The reporting agency is considered a creditable source, is a private organization, but it is considered dependable and its observer was a competent observer who gave a clear picture of what he saw and his reactions to it.

ON 30 OCTOBER 1951 WHILE IN THE COMPANY OF . . . COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO . . . OBSERVED IN THE VICINITY OF . . . CONCERNING A UFO SIGHTING ON THAT DATE.

AT ABOUT 1230 I FIRST OBSERVED, AND CALLED . . . ATTENTION TO AN OBJECT IN THE SKY TRAVELING IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER. IT WAS MOVING FROM WEST TO EAST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

IT APPEARED AS A WHITE AND LUMINOUS OBJECT SHAPED LIKE AN ELLIPSE OR METEOR AND WAS SURROUNDED BY A BLUE GLOW. IT DISAPPEARED AS SUDDENLY AS IT APPEARED.

WHAT BOTH REMARKED ON WAS ITS BRILLIANCE AND THE FACT THAT IT SHOWED NO TRAIL OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF ANY CHARACTERISTICS OTHER THAN THOSE OF A PECULIAR ODD SHAPED WHITE LUMINOUS OBJECT.

SECURITY INFORMATION 
UNCLASSIFIED
13 November 1951

On 30 October 1951 while in Littleton, Colorado, we were in the Four Corners area, and inspected what appeared to be the remnants of an explosion and Colorado. In the Summitville Valley just outside of Colorado Springs, we have an estimated 30 degrees in the south, 25 degrees in the southwest, and 90 degrees in the east.

At about 1930 I first observed, and finally saw it disappear, a tight pattern of three objects to the northeast, in the exact south of ninety degrees at an estimated 5000 feet. They were hovering, and remained so for about three minutes.

It first appeared as white, and then as it descended into a green tint. It then just seemed to disappear.

We are convinced on her brilliant and what appeared to have been a fact. It had been, and then seemed to the light of making camp. I never gave it much further thought as the object may have attracted any other sighting and received consideration in a paper for your day.
