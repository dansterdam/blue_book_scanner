10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj, white, size of a quarter, no trail, exhaust or sound. Obj was sighted near zenith & disappeared after moving from SW to NE for 60 to 90 secs.

11. COMMENTS
Limited info. Balloons might possibly account for sighting; however, the duration & character of the shot was short & the motion indicated appeared to be smooth rather than a flight that fluctuated. Also possible more probably that the sighting was spurious. However, there is no confirming data. So possible that sighting was a c. Cmac listed insufficient data.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: U.S.A.
ACTIVITY REPORTING: Grand Rapids, Michigan

SUBJECT: An unidentified flying object

SUMMARY:
On the 11th day of July 1958 this station received a call from Grand Rapids, Michigan COO reportedly that a civilian and two other persons had sighted an unidentified flying object. Subject object was sighted on 11 Jul 58 at 0252S.

Description of object in follow:
One round shaped object, the size of a quarter. Color white. No trail, exhaust or sound. Object was sighted near south (within 10 deg.) and disappeared after moving from SW to NE for 60 to 90 seconds, then disappeared behind clouds.

Location of observer was Grand Rapids Michigan. Weather conditions were as follows:

Broken ceiling.
Winds at 30,000 ft from 210 deg 20 knots.
40,000 ft from 270 deg 30 knots.
50,000 ft from 200 deg 20 knots, visibility 15 miles.

The sighting was reported through GOC, reliability reasonably good.

24 July 1958

MEMORANDUM FOR: Captain Miateck - AFCIN-483a

SUBJECT: General Orbital-Track Checks for Air Sciences Division.

1. This office has received a number of UFO reports from GOC posts in the Green Bay, Northern Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota areas. A query check discloses that these are primarily staffed with high school students now on vacation and elderly people with time on their hands. Their reliability is obvious. However, could appreciate if a check for Satellite be made on the basis of following observed in that area:

a. Time: Between 2120 to 2140 hours (local).
b. Date: 12 July 1958.
c. General direction: SSW to ENE.
d. UFO appearance: Very small, white and round.

2. Just received UFO report from Air Attache, France - there were four military observers. Basic data:

a. Place: NE France (50 N - 4 E).
b. Time: 2127 Z (GMT for that area considered 0. Therefore, local time same.)
c. Date: 11 July 1958.
d. General direction: 160 - 190 degrees to 4050 degrees, estimate, i. e. generally SW to NE.
e. Appearance: Round, white. In sight approximately one minute.

3. Your comments and results of your computations may be hand written directly on this memorandum. Would appreciate if you would give us a call.

Captain, USAF

Comment re sighting No. 1:

Date: 12 July 1958
Hours: 2120 - 2140 local
Place: Area near Greenway, Wisc.

13/0240 - 0240 July
88 W, 4500 (covers area to the North
and West also)

a. 0240 Z on 13 July 1958 A1 (Sputnik III rocket) was
over Lake Huron at 135 miles altitude.

Using general observation point of 45 degrees N - 90 degrees West I followed the rocket portion of the satellite (1958 A1) or Sputnik II at this particular time. It's orbit was about 115 miles by about 6 miles of lower Michigan. Although the direction of motion is consistent with that of Sputnik III, neither component seems to have been sufficiently law off the eastern horizon to be seen in the area described.

Comment re sighting No. 2:

Date: 11 July 1958
Time: 2127 Z
Place: NE France (50 N 4 E)

1958 A1 (rocket) should have been in the vicinity of the sighting area (50 degrees N, 4 degrees E) at 2127 Z on 11 July at an altitude of 165 miles traveling in a direction of 25 degrees.
