ATIC Conclusions: Probably
a high altitude jet. This
conclusion is based on reports
of a tiny light moving slowly
at high altitude. Moves with
minute or two from point to be
aircraft at high altitude - prob-
ably unperceptibly close with
radar on 1/4 deg units in the
sea

Difficult to follow-up in multiple
jumps of 1/4 deg. Better to
do so. Data rather detail.
