PARIS, SEPT. 25--(UPI)--CREW MEMBERS OF A PAN AMERICAN FLIGHT FROM NEW YORK TO PARIS SAID TODAY THEY SIGHTED LAST NIGHT A MYSTERIOUS LUMINOUS OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE A HIGH ALTITUDE ROCKET BURNING ITSELF OUT ABOVE THE ATMOSPHERE.

THE CREW MEMBERS TOLD UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL THEY SAW AN OBJECT AT EXTREMELY HIGH ALTITUDE TRAVELING "FROM SOUTH TO NORTH AT RIGHT ANGLES TO A VERTICAL SHAFT OF LIGHT TRAVERSING IT." THEY SAID THE SIGHTING TOOK PLACE AT 11 P.M. OVER THE EAST COAST OF LABRADOR.

THE CREW MEMBERS SAID THEY DID NOT WANT TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES FOR FEAR THEY MIGHT BE MISTAKEN FOR "PUBLICITY SEEKERS" BUT A PRESS RELEASE FROM THE PAN AMERICAN OFFICES IN PARIS SAID THEY WERE ABOARD FLIGHT 114 FROM NEW YORK UNDER COMMAND OF CAPT. HOWARD CONE.

THE CREW SAID THEIR IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE OBJECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LAST STAGE OF A ROCKET THAT HAD LEFT THE ATMOSPHERE AND THAT ITS MOVEMENT MIGHT BE DUE TO THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH.

THEY SAID IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A COMET, SINCE IT WOULD HAVE HAD A TAIL OF LIGHT STRETCHING BEHIND IT INSTEAD OF PERPENDICULAR TO ITS FLIGHT PATH.
