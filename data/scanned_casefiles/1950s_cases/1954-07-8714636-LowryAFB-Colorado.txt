cloud layer which at the time was estimated to be at 30,000 feet. The objects were visible for approximately a ten second period, and appeared to be traveling at an estimated rate of speed of 1,500 miles per hour, were occasionally and also appeared to be descending.

4. At 1430 hours Mr. [redacted] and [redacted] were interviewed by Special Agent RUSH at Air Traffic Control Center, Stapleton Field, Denver, Colorado. They advised they had been watching a B-36 type aircraft making passes over the Denver area at what they judged to be 30,000 feet. The B-36 disappeared behind some clouds and in attempting to resight the B-36 observed 4 or 5 shining objects at what they believed to be approximately 50,000 feet, climbing species at what they believed to be a tri-angular in shape and that they appeared to be capable of hovering in one spot for some period of time and then moving off in a normal rate of speed in a Northeasterly direction. The only thing unusual they observed about the objects were what appeared to be their ability to hover in one place for extended periods of time.

5. Observed the objects for approximately 35 minutes and then called the Flight Service Center at Lowry Air Force Base. Neither [redacted] nor any unusual rates of speed during their observation of these objects.

6. Information has reached this office to the effect that Operation CHECK POINT is having some maneuvers in this vicinity and that various air bases in this vicinity have either no knowledge or very limited knowledge of aircraft participating. At approximately 2000 hours on 9 July 1954 local radio station advised during a news broadcast that Operation CHECK POINT 14 was in this vicinity and that F-86 type aircraft was repelling the attack at exceptionally high altitudes.

1. At 1320 hours on 9 July 1954 this office received a telephonic communication from Captain [redacted], Operations Officer, Flight Service, Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, advising that between 1500 and 1510 hours he had observed 8 or 7 objects flying at a very high altitude and rate of speed and that he did not believe the objects were conventional type aircraft.

2. Special Agent EDWARD L. RUSH and M. L. McABB conducted interviews with personnel of the 3933rd Radar Bomb Squadron (Detachment 3), who arrived that at about 1500 hours on 9 July a B-36 aircraft was in the vicinity of Lowry Air Force Base flying at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet and was working a radar and tracking problem. All personnel interviewed advised that no unusual formations or objects had been sighted on the radar scopes at that time. However, the radar devices showing the B-36 aircraft were very effective.

3. Special Agents McABB and RUSH interviewed Captain [redacted] approximately 1545 hours 9 July 1954 and obtained the following information: At approximately 1300 hours on 9 July 1954 Captain [redacted] telephonically contacted Mr. [redacted], Flight Dispatcher, United Air Lines, who stated that he and [redacted], Flight Dispatcher, United Air Lines, had been observing several objects flying at a very high altitude and requested that CONMAN also make some observations. Immediately proceeded out of his office and from the ramp in front of Operations Building, observed 3 or 7 objects overhead which appeared to be approximately one half inch in diameter, 3 or 4 of which were in some semblance of formation and were moving in a northwesterly direction and were a cirrus
