THEY WERE, BUT HE THOUGHT THEY WERE 100 TO 150 FEET LONG. THE VESSELS WERE ON A SOUTHERLY HEADING AND THEIR POSITION AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING WAS APPROXIMATELY 322°N -127°E. THE OBSERVERS RETURNED TO TORI-JIMA AND THEN WENT BACK TO THE AREA IN WHICH THESE VESSELS WERE SIGHTED. THE VESSELS WERE GONE.

HOWEVER, THE OBSERVERS SPOTTED WHAT APPEARED TO BE LARGE ORANGE OBJECTS, ABOUT TEN IN NUMBER, IN THE WATER BENEATH THE SURFACE. THE OBJECTS APPEARED RED LIKE LARGE "GOLD FISH" THEY WERE LINE ABREAST. EVENLY SPACED AND LYING BENEATH THE SURFACE. THE SIZE OF THESE OBJECTS WAS ESTIMATED AS THE SAME AS THE VESSELS THAT WERE SEEN EARLIER. THE OBSERVERS DESCENDED TO APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET AND FLEW ALONG THIS LINE OF OBJECTS. THE WEATHER AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING WAS: VISIBILITY: SLIGHTLY HAZY, CLOUD COVER: HIGH CIRRUS. UNQUOTE. SAF CANNOT DETERMINE SIGNIFICANCE AT PRESENT BUT IS TAKING FOLLOW-UP ACTION TO INCLUDE COORDINATION WITH NAVAL INTELLIGENCE, ATLO AND ANY REQUIRED RECONNAISSANCE.

REFERENCE SAFCOC-C 08131. YOUR
OBSERVATIONS GREATLY APPRECIATED. OUR ADVISES VESSELS WERE PART OF
U.S. FLEET AND GOLDFISH WERE DYE MARKERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH SONAR
BUOYS. THE ALERTNESS OF YOUR PILOTS IS COMMENDABLE AND ALTHOUGH NO
FOREIGN INCIDENT INVOLVED, REPORTS OF THIS TYPE TEND TO POINT UP
AWARENESS OF TENSION IN YOUR AREA.
