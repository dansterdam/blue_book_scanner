THEY WERE, BUT HE THOUGHT THEY WERE 120 TO 150 FEET LONG. THE VESSELS WERE ON A SOUTHERLY HEADING AND THEIR POSITION AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING WAS APPROXIMATELY 32ON-127E. THE OBSERVERS PURSUED TO KORJITA AND THERE WENT BACK TO THE AREA IN WHICH THESE VESSELS WERE SIGHTED. THE VESSELS WERE GONE. HOWEVER, THE OBSERVERS SPOTTED WHAT APPEARED TO BE LARGE ORANGE OBJECTS, ABOUT TEN IN NUMBER, IN THE WATER BENEATH THE SURFACE. THE OBJECTS APPEARED RED LIKE LARGE "GOLD FISH" THEY WERE LINE ABREAST, EVENLY SPACED AND LYING BENEATH THE SURFACE. THE SIZE OF THESE OBJECTS WAS ESTIMATED AS THE SAME AS THE VESSELS THAT WERE SEEN EARLIER. THE OBSERVERS DESCENDED TO APPROXIMATELY 132 FEET AND FLEW ALONG THIS LINE OF OBJECTS. THE WEATHER AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING WAS VISILILITY SLIGHTLY HAZY, CLOUD COVER HIGH CIRRUS. UNQUOTE.
