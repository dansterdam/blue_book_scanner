Shining obj w/flashing red lights. 20-30° in diameter. "Looked like a lit-up bird cage". Lit up surrounding area. Very low when first sighted. Disappeared at high alt. Straight & level. Then zoomed up. Climbed rapidly out of sight.

11. COMMENTS
In a rpt fm Univ of Mich. observatory. Telescope was focused on Venus. Witness was working w/their trade-telescope. This telescope was lighted by a floodlight & on an almost full moon. The observer also has wire mesh attached which would create the "bird-cage" effect by some kind of reflection. Could be a VWOM radio tower which is in line w/source's location of observatory. The telescope was elevated & the 5th, location of obj to be near the flood light was turned off, creating

Major Robert J. Friend
A.T.I.C.
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
P.O. Box 9487
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major Friend:

I think that you and your associates will be amused at this Flying Saucer story and of its explanation. I would suggest that fairly wide coverage be given this incident since it is a beaut. I like the idea about its "zooming off into the sky." I wish, however, that all of our cases could be so neatly solved!

I will shortly submit my expenses incurred on the past trip and, as per your instructions, I will have the cost of the plane and my incidental expenses absorbed within the regular consulting fee. I'll have to remember this for my income tax records. Otherwise I'll be paying tax on travel. However, I think I can keep my records straight, if this is more helpful to you that way. You will hear from me in about a week on this matter.

I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity of giving the talk the other day and I am particularly glad we had a two-star General present. My only hope is that my rather definite insistence on "talking things more seriously," especially as to the Michele book, etc., was not taken in the wrong spirit. I believe we must take things seriously because the public just does look toward the Air Force as the source of real authority and knowledge on these matters and I am not aware of what's going on and of a proper scientific treatment of these things, we lay ourselves open to a great deal of criticism and, unfortunately, even ridicule. It is this that I had in mind when I stressed these points so strongly. You will be hearing from me.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek
Associate Director

ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN

25 March, 1959

Dear Allen:

Here is the flying saucer story I referred to in my last letter.
Since you have been on an evaluation board, you may be amused.

It is an interesting example of pretty objective observation by
the people who thought they saw the saucer. They later even
described the ringlike structure of telescope dish, which is
covered only with a wide mesh, of course. All they described was
accurate, except they mistook the turning of the lights and the
small change in relative bearing (due to distance of the
telescope from the road) for motion!!

Sincerely,

From the Ann Arbor News, March 23, 1959

[Newspaper clipping text is mostly illegible]

1. The U of M 85' radio telescope is clearly visible from North Territorial Rd.

2. The top of Peach Mountain is "low in the sky."

3. At the time of observation (1:30 a.m.), the dish was looking at the SW horizon and illuminated by the light of a full (almost) moon and a floodlight.

4. The WUOM radio tower with its red aircraft warning lights is directly in line with the radio telescope as viewed from the intersection of North Territorial and Dexter Town Hall roads.

5. The dish was being rotated from the SW horizon to the zenith so that an observer on the ground would see less and less of its surface and more of its bird-cage-like under structure.

6. When the dish reached the zenith the floodlights were turned off, the dish "seemed off into the sky," and we went home.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 90—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

Hovering in the sky south of the road. According to their report to the Air Force, the UFO was an elongated oval with a dome on top, something like a bird cage, and brilliantly illuminated by two shafts of intense pale-yellow light that sprang from the bottom and converged over the top. Frightened at this apparition, the witnesses could provide only uncertain estimates of distance and size. The object seemed to be twenty to thirty feet in diameter, was at an altitude of about 200 feet when first seen, and was hovering about two miles away. As they drove on, the object seemed to move and travel parallel with the car for about a mile. The yellow lights dimmed and a circle of eight or ten red lights suddenly appeared on the underside, the UFO rose vertically, very rapidly, and vanished in a few seconds. It had been in view for a period of five to ten minutes.

Checking the most probable explanations first, ATIC officials found that the nearby Willow Run Airport had had no aircraft in the vicinity at the time and that no star or planet seemed to be involved. Further investigation showed that the flying bird cage was actually the radio telescope of the University of Michigan. The telescope was installed on the top of Peach Mountain and was clearly visible from the road on which the witnesses were traveling. On the underside of the eighty-five-foot "dish" was a wire-mesh structure that suggested the bird cage. At the time of the sighting the dish was facing in the direction of the witnesses and was illuminated by a floodlight as well as by the bright moonlight. It had seemed to be following the car only because the car itself was moving. The astronomers operating the telescope were rotating the dish from the horizon to the zenith, and the yellow lights dimmed because the witnesses were seeing less and less of the surface. The "circle" of red lights was the red aircraft-warning lights on the WUOM radio tower, which lay in a direct line between the telescope and the witnesses. When the dish reached the zenith and was pointed to the sky overhead, the operating crew turned off the floodlights. The dish was no longer visible to the witnesses, who interpreted the sudden disappearance as a sudden vertical ascent into the sky [1].

Michigan's Flying Bird Cage

A UFO sighting based on mistaken identification of strange lights occurred in the early morning hours of March 22, 1959, near Ann Arbor, Michigan. The night was clear, the moon was nearly full, and visibility was unusually good. At about 1:30 a.m., a man and his wife driving on a country road suddenly noticed a strange object
