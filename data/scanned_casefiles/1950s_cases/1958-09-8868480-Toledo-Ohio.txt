Gentlemen:

On September 8, 1958, about 6:30 PM, it was brought to my attention by the neighborhood children that there was a bright glowing object in the sky.

This object stayed stationary for approximately two minutes from the time I saw it. It appeared very bright and glowing while continually moving in an unusual circular motion.

Suddenly this object soared straight upward, turned black and left a small white trail behind. It then made a right angle turn and suddenly disappeared out of sight.

I took the enclosed photographs just before the object disappeared out of sight. It appears as a small black spot followed by a white trail of vapor. I have encircled the object with a green pencil on the negatives. The prints show a white circle around the object.

I am passing these photographs on to you for whatever information they may serve.

Sincerely,

Pamela A. Bova

DATE: 13 Oct 58

SUBJECT: (U) Request for Photo Analysis

1. Request your review and comments of the attached photographs.

2. The object in the photo, where it appears to be climbing, looks like an F-100 series aircraft, in a climbing attitude.

3. Although the observer states that the object was stationary for approximately 2 minutes, these photographs seem to indicate a jet aircraft in flight. However, would appreciate your comments to substantiate this explanation.

1. The attached photographs are of such poor quality as to preclude any accurate evaluation beyond pure conjecture.

2. It is recommended that the original film be made available to this office and/or 402 for evaluation. It is possible that an optical rather than a photographic enlargement might provide us with enough information to either confirm or deny your explanation.

Dear Ki

An attempt was made to analyze the photographic prints
you submitted to the Air Force. They are of such quality that
an accurate evaluation cannot be made.

Request the negative be forwarded to this Center in order
for us to make a more accurate evaluation of the object concerned.

Sincerely,

1. The quality of the two negatives is so poor that we cannot definitely identify the object in question. In all probability the image was caused by an aircraft in flight, however, we cannot identify it as being or type.

Dear Miss

Enclosed are the two negatives you submitted to this Center for analysis. The negatives were found to be of such quality the object is in question could not be definitely identified. However, from the trail left by the object, it is felt the object was probably an aircraft in flight.

Your interest in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
