SUMMARY OF INFORMATION
Preparing Office: Don Intel Br, G-2 Sec, Hq Third Army, Ft McPherson, Georgia
Date: 22 Jan 51

Subject: Unidentified Object Sighted Over Fort Benning, Georgia, 12 Jan 51

Summary of Information:
Major Gordon, 116th CIC Detachment, Fort Benning, Georgia, reported to this headquarters by telephone at 1100 hours, 19 January 1951, as follows:

516th Ordnance Mtn. Co. stated that on 12 January 1951, while engaged in the practice of Fire maintenance East of Fire Station No. 2 on French Field, Fort Benning, Georgia, his attention was invited to a very bright object in the sky almost overhead. At first sight it appeared to be a very bright star. The sky was clear at this time with a few thin and scattered clouds traversing in a southeasterly direction. This object was clearly visible whenever those clouds appeared over it. The time at which this object was first sighted was approximately 1101 hours. It remained stationary for approximately 20 minutes, then clearly moved directly south at a very high rate of speed leaving a very thin visible wake and then disappeared completely. It traveled about six times its own length before disappearing. Its wake was very short and fan shaped. He was not certain as to the shape of the object, but said it appeared round and could have been spherical or circular shaped. The size seemed to be that of an ordinary kitchen match when holding the match about at arm's length. He was not certain of the altitude but stated it was well above the clouds which appeared to be about 1000 feet at altitude.

A check was made by the Public Information Office as to whether the Muscogee County Air Force or Lawson Air Force Base had sent up any weather balloons and a negative report was received.

This object was seen by nine other people at the same time.
