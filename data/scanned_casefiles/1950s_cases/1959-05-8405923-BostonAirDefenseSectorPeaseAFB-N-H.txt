8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 36

9. COURSE: [Illegible]

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
5 tracks appeared on radar, spaced 200-400 knots, alt 7-15 thousand ft w/majority around 10,000ft. Unidentified. Remained within 60 mi E of Boston, more tracks appeared. Total of 18 tracks now involved. Highest alt 36,000ft. Some tracks approached the coast, then reversed course & faded out. Other targets approached coast, faded & were unidentified.

11. COMMENTS:
The 18 unidentified tracks referred to an art show all indications of being false targets. While the ops center was certain that, during was not possible, the fact remains that many orders do show unidentified tracks with no jet or balloon type of peculiar transmission characteristics.

12. CONCLUSIONS: [No boxes checked]

SUBJECT: Unusual Radar Sighting (U)

TO: ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

The attached message, received by this Headquarters from 26th Air Division (SAGE), is forwarded for your information and necessary action. The delay in forwarding this information was necessitated by an inquiry to Headquarters USAF for an interpretation regarding the reporting to ATIC unknowns originating in the air defense system. This problem is presently being coordinated at this Headquarters and you will be advised of the results as well as any expected increase in reports that may be forwarded from this Command.

MAY 1959, PAR A: APPROX 0023Z, FIVE PENDING TRACKS APPEARED, NO
FLIGHT PLANS WERE AVAILABLE. TRACKS WERE CLOSE TO PEASE AFB IN
BOSTON AIR DEFENSE SECTOR AND WITHIN THE AIR DEFENSE IDENTIFICA-
TION ZONE. SPEEDS WERE 260-400 KNOTS, ALTITUDES FROM 7-18, 000
FT WITH MAJORITY AROUND 10 THOUSAND FT. IMMEDIATELY THERE-
AFTER, WITHIN 60 MILES EAST OF BOSTON, MORE TRACKS APPEARED. TEN
ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT WERE BROUGHT UP TO 5 MINUTE ALERT, 4 AT
STEWART, 2 AT WESTOVER AND 4 AT OTIS. FOUR AIRCRAFT WERE AIR-
BORNE AND TWO MORE WERE IN TURN-AROUND. PAR B: A TOTAL OF 18
TRACKS WERE INVOLVED. HIGHEST ALTITUDE 36,000 FEET. FOUR TRACKS
WERE LATER

IDENTIFIED; TWO BY SCRAMBLE AT 0166Z AS NAVY AIRCRAFT; ONE AS A
BOEING 707 AT 0161Z AND ONE RC-121 AT 0029Z BY REVISED FLIGHT
PLAN. SIX SCRAMBLES PLUS TWO DIVERTS WERE MADE AGAINST EIGHT OF
THE TARGETS BUT ALL FADED PRIOR TO INTERCEPT. THE REMAINING SIX
FADED AND WERE SCRUBBED AFTER LOSING RADAR DATA BETWEEN 0023-
0044Z. PAR C: ALL RADARS IN BOSTON SECTOR WERE CHECKED AND THE
COMPUTER WAS CHECKED BY IBM. SECTOR IDENTIFICATION OFFICER CHECKED
WITH NEW YORK AND BOSTON AIR MOVEMENTS IDENTIFICATION SECTION FOR
POSSIBLE MAJOR AIR MOVEMENT. EASTERN NORAD REGION WAS ALSO
CHECKED WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS BEING REPORTED. RADAR AND FST-2
AT SITE P-10 AND OTHER SITES WERE CHECKED AND FOUND TO BE IN
ORIENTATION. PERMANENT ECHO CHECKS WERE ALSO MADE AND SETS
WERE FOUND TO BE TRACKS. TRACKING MERIT WAS GOOD ON ALL TRACKS
AND SHOWED GOOD DATA UNTIL REACHING LAND, OR UNTIL LEAVING THE
BOSTON SECTOR. SOME TARGETS APPROACHED THE COAST, THEN REVERSED
COURSE AND HEADED OUTBOUND. OTHER TARGETS APPROACHED COAST,
FADED AND WERE EXTRAPOLATED INLAND. ALL TRACKS WERE CHECKED FOR
MULTIPLE PICKUP FROM P-10, P-13 AND TEXAS TOWER 11. THESE
STATIONS TRACKED THE TARGETS SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SEPARATELY DURING
THE PERIODS, INCLUDING SITE P-103. BOSTON AIR DEFENSE SECTOR
CHECKED WITH RADAR MAPPING PERSONNEL AT

ABOVE SITES FOR VERIFICATION. ALL VERIFIED BLIPS AT THE POSITIONS ABOVE CONFIRMED THE DIRECTIONS, PAR E: THERE IS NO APPARENT REASON FOR THE UNKNOWN TRACKS. ALL EQUIPMENT WAS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.

AIR DEFENSE ARTILLERY STATED THAT THEIR RADAR ALSO PICKED UP AND TRACKED 6 OF THESE TARGETS THROUGH THE AREA, HIGHLIGHTING WERE ALSO TAKEN ON THE TARGETS. EVERYTHING POSSIBLE WAS ACCOMPLISHED TO CHECK AND VERIFY INPUTS. ALL AVAILABLE AIRCRAFT WERE SCRAMBLED, INCLUDING SOME FROM ADJACENT SECTORS. THERE WAS NO AIRCRAFT CARRIER ACTIVITY DURING THE TIME IN QUESTION. PAR F: WX AT THE TIME WAS: SCATTERED CLOUDS BETWEEN 8 AND 10 THOUSAND FEET.

NANTUCKET SOUNDING AT 63/0001Z INDICATED THE CHANGE IN REFRACTIVE INDEX WEA ONLY 7 BETWEEN SURFACE AND 1000 FEET. NO DUCTING POSSIBLE.

Ltr, AFCIN-1463, 10 Jun 59, Unusual Radar Sighting

1st Ind (AFCIN-1463/V. D. Bryant/TCO1/dz)                                16 Jun 59

ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

TO:   AFCIN-1463

The 14 unidentified tracks referred to in this report show all indications of being false targets - revealing their course and finally disappearing from the screen. The fact that no scrambled aircraft contacted any target can be taken as assurance that the targets were false. Likewise, the fact that several radars picked up the same "targets" is no assurance that the targets were real. While the report says dieting was not possible, the two reasons that may explain do show navigational returns which must be due to some type of peculiar transmission characteristics.

Date        3 May 1959                     Hour (Z)    0023-00462

WX    Scattered clouds between 8 and 10 thousand ft.

Description    Five tracks appeared on radar, speeds were 200-400 knots, alt tubes from 7-13 thousand ft. with majority around 10 thousand ft. Immediately thereafter within 50 mi E of Boston, more tracks appeared. A total of 15 tracks were involved. Highest altitude 36,000 ft. Some targets appeared the coast, then reversed course and headed outbound. Other targets approached coast, faded and were extrapolated inland.

Analysis and Conclusions: The fourteen unidentified tracks referred to in report show all indications of being false targets. While the report states that ducting was not possible, the fact remains that many radars do show unexplained returns which must be due to some type of peculiar transmission characteristics.
