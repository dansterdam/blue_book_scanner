12    THE NEWS AND OBSERVER, RALEIGH, N. C. TUESDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 17, 1950

Miami Pilots
Saw 'Saucers'
Around Bragg
Miami, Fla., Oct. 16.—(JP)—What
Capt. George A. Woodward of Miami
and his crew of Miami Airlines,
Inc., DC-4 over North Carolina yes-
terday might not have been flying
among but he doesn't know what.
Woodward and Co-Pilot Williams
told Civil Aeronautics Administra-
tion's Miami office and the Civil Aero-
nautics Administration office in
Florence, S. C. and if headquarters
received similar reports, the latest about three
weeks ago.

"We took off from Raleigh for
Miami at 4 p. m. (EST) and 20 min-
utes later I saw four shiny objects
that looked like balloons," Wood-
ward said.

"My co-pilot looked at me and
said: 'Do you see what I see?'
'I told him I did and we headed
toward them. They appeared to be
about 100 feet in diameter, of some
shiny substance like aluminum or
chrome. They were thicker in the
middle and tapered off, like two
saucers fitted together.

"They were in line about 25 feet
apart. We were flying about 8,000
feet. We chased them but they backed
away, descended, then took off in a
burst of speed.

Woodward said he had been flying
18 years and had never seen such
objects. He said he wasn't sure what
were but they weren't planes or
balloons.

The incident was reported near Pope Air
Force Base, Fort Bragg, N. C., and
reported to the CAA officer in
Lumberton, N. C. and Florence, he
said.

There is also a circular stamp/marking at the bottom of the page which appears partially illegible.

NF235N75                                                                October 16, 1950

SUBJECT: Report of unconventional type a/c.
TO: Director of Intelligence United States Air Force.

1. The following report of observation of unconventional type aircraft is submitted in spite of the termination of inquiry into this subject.

2. On Oct. 15, 1950, at 1625 EST, the undersigned observed a jet plane(s) moving in a Northeasterly direction at an altitude of 35-40,000 feet. Plane(s) not visible but characteristic sound accompanied flight as well as an easily observed and clearly defined contrail.

3. At 1625.40 while observer was following the flight of the jet plane(s) an object oblate and spheroid in shape crossed the line of flight of the jet plane(s) and continued its movement in a Northwesterly direction. Total length of observation, 10-12 seconds.

4. Object appeared to be constructed of aluminum or like substance......speed unknown......altitude unknown......trail none. Object followed a perfectly straight line of flight.

5. Observer realizes that paucity of detail in this report makes it unsuitable material from an intelligence standpoint, but there is a strong likelihood that the object sighted is the same or one of same objects sighted and reported by a Commercial air lines pilot of the Miami Air Lines. He reported sighting a group of saucer-like objects (four in number) in the vicinity of Pope AFB, N.C., at 1620 EST. Pilot pursued objects for period of time before losing them.

6. If certain assumptions are made, the following conclusions are well within the realm of possibility:
Pilot's time of observation - 1620 EST

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS
DOD DIR E2600.10                                                        15 Oct. 1950

Length of pursuit (estimated) - 3 minutes
Speed of pursuing a/c (estimated) - 180 mph.

If pursuit is made in a Northerly direction and broken off at end of three minutes, this would place the objects sighted about 10 miles North of Pope AFB at 1625 EST.

Airline distance from point of his observation to Chapil Hill, N.C. (assumed to be the point of next observation) is approximately 47 miles.

Time elapsed from point of last observation to point of next observation 2 minutes 20 seconds, distance traversed 47 miles. Speed of object 19 plus miles per minute, or roughly 1200 miles per hour.

7. Observer recognizes that conjecture is not a suitable basis for inquiry and offers the analysis in paragraph 6 only as a suggested method of evaluation.

8. The undersigned regards the above material to be of a classified nature and will so regard it.
