The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a report or document related to a "flying object" sighting. The text describes various details of the observation, including the object's appearance (circular, small, red/white/green in color), its behavior (no formation, star-like yet not, no trail), and the visual details observed by the ground and air (flashing lights, erratic movement, close together, remained in sky with no flight path or disappearance). The report indicates the sighting occurred 25 miles from Lewiston, Maine, and lasted for 4-5 hours.
