Oval to oblong obj, size of silver
dollar, greenish red, blue, & white.
Approx 20 distinct bright colored
lights appeared to be suspended fm
the obj & these were alternately
fading in a random pattern. To one
observer, obj appeared almost motionless. To another it appeared to have
rapid movement with erratic directional change. Obj remained in area after
sighting.

11. COMMENTS
The latitude of the a/c at the
time of the sighting, apparent
lack of motion of the a/c as
its description point toward
this obj being an aurora.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical
