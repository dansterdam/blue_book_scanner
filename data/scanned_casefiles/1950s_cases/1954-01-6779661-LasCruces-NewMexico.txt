Additional Information Not Covered in Form.

This object was a pulsating light, observed through four complete cycles. The period was approximately 1½ seconds, and a rough period-luminosity curve on the logarithmic stellar magnitude scale is drawn below:

[A graph showing luminosity over time, with a wavy line representing the pulsating light's intensity over approximately 3 seconds]

The part of the curve below the dotted line is extrapolated beyond the limit of unaided vision.

The identity of this object can be definitely established to be the same as that of the one observed at OBOE Askania, by inter-com exchange immediately following the sighting.

The operator who confirmed this observation from OBOE Askania station was:

I would be quite willing to discuss further detailed information with an authorized representative.
