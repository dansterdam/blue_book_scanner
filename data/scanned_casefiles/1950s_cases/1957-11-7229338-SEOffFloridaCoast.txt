II. RELIABILITY:        Although SOURCE claims to have had two years, and
although he holds a G3-11 rating, he does not keep a diary or detailed
details of the sighting he witnessed, and so is able to remember precisely what he
saw; however, the later made somewhat contradictory statements. At first he stated
that as the object passed at its nearest point, he lit "kind of a heat wave" and
that when he reached home he found he had a severe sunburn. Subsequently medical
observation disclosed that there was no trace of sunburn, and SOURCE later admitted
that he had been in error on this point. By the time this interview was able to
make arrangements to talk with SOURCE, he had been interviewed several times by
reporters and had made a taped radio interview; he did not seem adverse to the large
amount of publicity which followed.

Whereas in actuality he is a "technician". SOURCE, on several occasions, stated that he had had
some doubts as to whether or not he should report his sighting in order to resolve
this question, he had telephoned his chief, who told him he saw nothing wrong in
describing it. SOURCE was quite definite in his statements and appeared to have
little doubt about any details of what he had seen.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 0120102 Nov 57, SOURCE
was driving south in open countryside on US Highway 54 toward El Paso, Texas. He
was alone in his automobile, a 1957 Mercury, and traveling around seven miles
per hour. The radio was tuned to an El Paso, Texas, station, which, according to
SOURCE, gives good reception in a rather spotty area where there are several dead
spots. SOURCE stated that his radio began to fade out; simultaneously his car began
to slow up, almost as though it were developing battery trouble. About this time
he noticed about six other cars (criminally reported as ten) which had pulled off
the road; their passengers had disappeared and were parking. SOURCE followed
out, left his car, and saw an egg-shaped object in the northeast sky, just below
the Sacramento Mountains. SOURCE does not wear spectacles, nor did he observe it
through binoculars. He estimated that it was 35 degrees from the horizon, and about
45 degrees from true North. It appeared to be luminous, the color of mother-of-
pearl, and with a faint, purplish tinge; there was no glow or corona. SOURCE stated
that it was brighter than the dull sky background, although the brightness did not
approximate that of an automobile headlight; at no time did its brightness change.
SOURCE stated that the object appeared to be solid, rather than transparent, but
could offer no theory about construction details. SOURCE estimated that the object

appeared to be solid, rather than transparent, but could offer no theory about
construction details. SOURCE estimated that the object descended from an altitude
of about 5000 feet to between 1500 and 2500 feet, turned west toward the San Andres
Mountains, and disappeared at approximately 15 degrees from the horizon, and 270
degrees from true North (Refer to Figure A1). The object appeared to be between
three and five miles ahead of the first car parked along the road. Approximately
two minutes later, SOURCE observed the object make an identical appearance, although
slightly south of the path of the first. SOURCE stated that the object appeared
to be about the size of a pea held at arm's length, but stated he believed it to be
about 500 feet long; he noticed no ports, heard no sounds, noticed no smoke or vapor
trails, and said it was sharply outlined with nothing fuzzy about the silhouette.
SOURCE stated that it did not appear to change shape at any time, did not stand
still, did not flicker or seem to pulsate. As the object passed, SOURCE noticed a
distinct rise in his body temperature, as though he had been exposed to a "giant sun
lamp", and later stated that he had incurred a sunburn. (*This statement was later
retracted.) During this time, SOURCE discussed the phenomena with two motorists, one of whom, as did SOURCE, made notes; the other allegedly took photographs
of the object. SOURCE took down the names of these two men, although he neglected
to take down the license numbers of their automobiles. A subsequent search for the
two men failed to disclose their whereabouts, nor could they be further identified.
No other reports of such a sighting were made by anyone else. Although the day was
chill with scattered clouds and a 2500 foot overcast, SOURCE stated that
he had observed the two flights of the object for a total of three or four minutes;
he later claimed the speed of the object to be between 1500 and 2000 miles per
hour. SOURCE has never been married. SOURCE stated that his car started again
quite easily, although the battery had been steaming.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that SOURCE possibly witnessed an optical phenomenon for the following reasons:

    a. The object does not remotely meet identification criteria for aircraft, balloons, meteors, stars or planets.

    b. Although the reported color of the object is consonant with that of ball lightning, the fantastic speed of the unidentified object rules out that possibility.

    c. The reported shape, lack of trail and sound, incredible speed and other reported conditions are in harmony with the theory of an optical illusion.

2. It would be manifestly impossible for SOURCE to have observed the object for as long as he stated if it were traveling at the estimated speed.

3. Due to the flat white sandy terrain, mirages cannot be considered unusual occurrence.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 69—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, describing his sighting of
an E-M-radiating UFO at least 500 feet long. About one o'clock
on Monday afternoon, Mr. X stated, he was returning to base after
a weekend in El Paso [a]. While driving along a desert stretch
of U. S. Highway 54 near the town of Orogrande, he noticed a group
of cars stopped ahead of him, their passengers standing in the road,
pointing at the sky. Looking up, he saw an iridescent egg-shaped
object at least 500 feet long—more than twice the size of the UFOs
reported in the preceding two days. As it approached, the flying
egg exerted a force that killed the engine of his car, generated a
wave of heat that gave him a bad burn, and demonstrated a startling
new characteristic: it silenced his radio in his car. (During the
next few days, reports of similar encounters usually included a
jammed radio.) When the UFO took off toward the mountains and
disappeared, Mr. X started his car again and drove on into Alamo-
gordo to the home of a friend, Mrs. Coral Lorenzen.

One of the most zealous amateur investigators of UFO reports,
Mrs. Lorenzen had founded the Aerial Phenomena Research Organ-
ization (APRO) (see Chapter xiv) in January 1952, and from 1953
to 1956 had been employed at Holloman Air Force Base. After
listening to Mr. X's story and examining the notes he had scribbled
during the sighting (unfortunately they proved to be illegible, but
for some reason no one has ever suggested that the pen or pencil
was also hexed by the UFO), she hurried him down to the local
radio station where he made the taped interview that was broadcast
later that evening.

A daylight visit by an E-M flying egg some 500 feet long would
supposedly have attracted the attention of many witnesses. Air
Force investigators could find only one: Mr. X. According to his
testimony, the passengers of several automobiles (his estimate of
the number of cars varied from time to time but he eventually set-
tled on ten) had stood in the road watching the unknown object.
A persistent search by Air Force officials failed to locate any one
of these persons. The witness showed no sign of the burns he al-
legedly suffered. In short, the only evidence to support his story
was Mr. X's own and the authorities sensibly concluded that the
incident was either a hoax or a hallucination, inspired by newspaper
publicity about Levelland's flying eggs.

But it this is true no one ever found out who they were. Then Air Force wrote off story as "presumably" suggested by the Levelland report.

Engineer 'Sunburned'
By Flying 'Thing'

ALAMOGORDO, N. M., Nov. 5 (UP)—An electronics engineer reported seeing an unidentified flying object on an isolated desert highway near Alamogordo in southern New Mexico yesterday.

James Stokes, 42, an engineer in an upper air research project at the Air Force Missile Development Center near Alamogordo, said 10 automobiles stopped or were stopped while the object appeared. Stokes said he was driving on U. S. Highway 54, between White Sands Proving Ground and Missile Development Center, in a taped interview for Terry Clark, news director at station KALG in Alamogordo.

The object approached from the northeast over the Sacramento Mountains. He said the first indication that something was wrong was a gradual fading of the radio in his automobile.

Then, he said, the car engine died, and he noticed that several other cars on the highway had stopped. Mr. Stokes said he noticed that the occupants were getting out of their cars and pointing to the sky.

"I saw a light-colored, egg-shaped object as big as a pass at the highway, across the road not more than two miles ahead," he said. It then moved away toward the Organ Mountains near a White Sands Proving Grounds to the southwest.

"It had no visible portholes and there was no vapor trail," Mr. Stokes said he remembered the details precisely because he pulled out a notebook and jotted down everything he saw.

"When I got back to my car and checked it in the engine, I found it intact, but the battery was steaming. It started with no trouble and I headed for a phone to notify officials at the Air Force Missile Development Center at Alamogordo."

(An Air Force public information officer told United Press last night he had no information to report.)

James Stokes, 45, an engineer from the Air Force Missile Development Center at Holloman Air Force Base, Alamogordo, N. M., where stopped on an isolated desert highway near White Sands Proving Grounds Monday.

His description was similar to reports filtering about a big ball of fire fitting along over the week end. Texas area observers generally said as bright as the sun was reported seen at White Sands Proving Grounds. Experts used in the first A-bomb explosion.


- page 25 -

At 1:10 p.m. the same day, Nov. 4th, of the Air Force Missile Development Center, Holloman AFB in New Mexico, was driving south of Orogrande, N. M., when his car radio faded out and his motor stopped. Noticing a number of other stopped cars along the highway, he got out and saw a large pear-shaped object with a surface like "mother of pearl" coming out of the northeast. The object made several "shallow dives" across the highway before it departed to the northwest.

If the Levelland, Gulf of Mexico, and White Sands reports were "misunderstood natural phenomena," then the must be the report from Alamogordo by "Stories of a light strong enough to cause sunburn," said the AF, were not verified on interview with the originator; and he also "acknowledged that the fade-out of his radio was the same sort of thing that had happened in that area before."

What else they might mean we are in no position to say. Stokes is employed as an electronics engineer at Holloman AFB, and there are more ways than one to skin a cat. Perhaps the Air Force was being tactful about an employee's unstable temperament; perhaps he was willing to help them out of their explanation problem by agreeing that his radio had faded out in that area before. But had his motor faded out also? And what about the other witnesses, in cars on the road behind, who experienced the same trouble? True, these witnesses could not be found; but having seen the Levelland investigator at work, we may certainly doubt that the AF made any real effort to locate supporting witnesses.

CLERGYMAN SEES UFO IN SOUTH PACIFIC

Engineer and GIs Sight 500-Foot 'Flying Saucer'

ALAMOGORDO, N. M., Nov. 5 (UP)—An electronics engineer reported seeing an unidentified flying object near Alamogordo in southern New Mexico yesterday.

James Stokes, 42, an engineer in an upper air search project at the Air Force Missile Development Center near Alamogordo, said the object appeared yesterday on U. S. highway 51, between White Sands, proving grounds and the Air Force Missile Development center.

He added the object appeared to be about 500 feet in length, with a shiny surface and a mother of pearl glow.

Earlier in the day, officials at White Sands, proving grounds said two Army patrols reported seeing a similar object or objects on Sunday.

SEEN IN TEXAS

Reports came Sunday from Levelland, Tex., and other UFOs.

A dispatch from Honolulu said a number of Fiji Island natives reported seeing a similar object in the South Pacific. The object was sighted four times. The week of Oct. 13-19, according to an official government report issued in Suva.

Mr. Stokes, in a taped interview for Terry Clark's news director at KGAK radio station in Alamogordo, reported that the object approached from the northeast over the Monto Mountains. He said the first indication that something was out of the ordinary was a peculiar fading of the radio in his auto.

Then, he said, the car engine died, and he noticed that several other cars on the highway had stopped.

EGG-SHAPED

"Looking up," Mr. Stokes said, "I saw a light-colored, egg-shaped object making a slight movement across the sky to the northeast."

Then it wheeled and made a pass at the highway, across the road not more than two miles ahead.

"As it passed at its closest point I could feel a kind of heat wave, but there was no smoke or flame visible."

BATTERY STRAINS

"When I got back to my car and checked in the engine, I found it intact, but the battery was straining. It started with no trouble and I backed it a phone to notify the development center at Alamogordo."

Mr. Stokes said he noted later, after he reached home, that his car battery was weak.

Officials at White Sands proving grounds, where missiles are tested, said two separate military patrol reports of seeing an unidentified flying object were made Sunday over an isolated area on the proving grounds, near "Polly" site where the first atomic bomb was exploded in 1945.

ALAMOGORDO, N.M., NOV. 5.--(UP)--AN ELECTRONICS ENGINEER REPORTED
SEEING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ON AN ISOLATED DESERT HIGHWAY
NEAR ALAMOGORDO IN SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO YESTERDAY.

AT THE AIR FORCE MISSILE DEVELOPMENT CENTER NEAR ALAMOGORDO, SAID
10 AUTOMOBILES STOPPED OR WERE STOPPED WHEN THE OBJECT APPEARED
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON ON U.S. HIGHWAY 54, BETWEEN WHITE SANDS
PROVING GROUNDS AND THE AIR FORCE MISSILE DEVELOPMENT CENTER.

EARLIER IN THE DAY, OFFICIALS AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS SAID
TWO ARMY PATROLS REPORTED SEEING A SIMILAR OBJECT OR OBJECTS ON
SUNDAY.

SIMILAR REPORTS CAME SUNDAY FROM LEVELLAND, TEX.
A DISPATCH FROM HONOLULU SAID A NUMBER OF FIJI ISLAND NATIVES AND
A WHITE CLERGYMAN REPORTED SEEING A SIMILAR OBJECT IN THE SOUTH
PACIFIC SKIES LAST MONTH. THE STRANGE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED FOUR TIMES
THE WEEK OF OCT. 13-19, ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT REPORT
ISSUED IN SUVA, CAPITAL-OF-THE-ISLAND GROUP.

IN A TAPED INTERVIEW FOR NEWS DIRECTOR AT STATION KALG IN ALAMOGORDO, REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT APPROACHED FROM
THE NORTHEAST OVER THE SACRAMENTO MOUNTAINS. HE SAID THE FIRST
INDICATION THAT SOMETHING WAS OUT OF THE ORDINARY WAS A GRADUAL FADING
OF THE RADIO IN HIS AUTOMOBILE.

THEN, HE SAID, THE CAR ENGINE DIED, AND HE NOTICED THAT SEVERAL
OTHER CARS ON THE HIGHWAY HAD STOPPED. STOKES SAID HE NOTICED THAT THE
OCCUPANTS WERE GETTING OUT OF THEIR CARS AND POINTING TO THE SKY.

"LOOKING UP," SAID IN THE INTERVIEW, "I SAW A LIGHT-
COLORED, EGG-SHAPED OBJECT MAKING A SHALLOW DIVE ACROSS THE SKY TO
THE NORTHWEST.

"THEN IT WHEELED AND MADE A PASS AT THE HIGHWAY, ACROSS THE ROAD
NOT MORE THAN TWO MILES AHEAD.

"AS IT THEN MOVED AWAY TOWARD THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS NEAR WHITE SANDS
PROVING GROUNDS TO THE SOUTHWEST, AS IT PASSED AT ITS CLOSEST POINT I COULD FEEL A KIND OF HEAT
WAVE, BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND.

"IT HAD NO VISIBLE PORTHOLES AND THERE WAS NO VAPOR TRAIL, SMOKE
OR FLAME VISIBLE."

SAID HE REMEMBERED THE DETAILS PRECISELY BECAUSE HE PULLED
OUT, A NOTEBOOK AND JOTTED DOWN EVERYTHING HE SAYS.

WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY CAR AND CHECKED THE ENGINE, I FOUND IT
INTACT, BUT THE BATTERY WAS STRANGE. IT STARTED WITH NO TROUBLE
AND I HEADED FOR A PHONE TO NOTIFY OFFICIALS AT THE AIR FORCE MISSILE
DEVELOPMENT CENTER AT ALAMOGORDO.

CAN AIR FORCE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER TOLD UNITED PRESS LAST
NIGHT HE HAD NO INFORMATION TO REPORT.)

SAID HE REACHED HOME, THAT HE HAD A SEVERE SUNBURN.

HE SAID MOST OF THE MOTORISTS WHO SAW THE OBJECT WERE ENGINEERS
OR TECHNICIANS WHO WORK ON ROCKET PROJECTS AT WHITE SANDS. HE IDENTIFIED
TWO OTHERS AT THE SCENE AS --------- OF LAS CRUCES, N. M., AND A
MR. --------- ALSO OF LAS CRUCES.

SAID THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 500 FEET IN LENGTH,
WITH A SHINY SURFACE LIKE MOTHER OF PEARL.

OFFICIALS AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS, WHERE MISSILES ARE TESTED,
SAID TWO SEPARATE MILITARY PATROLS REPORTED SEEING AN UNIDENTIFIED
FLYING OBJECT (OR OBJECTS) SUNDAY OVER AN ISOLATED AREA OF THE PROVING
GROUNDS, NEAR A TRINITY SITE WHERE THE FIRST ATOMIC BOMB WAS
EXPLODED IN 1945.

THEY INVESTIGATED THE SITE, BUT FOUND NO MARKINGS.

PXS

ALAMOGORDO, N.M., AN ELECTRONICS ENGINEER APPARENTLY CONVINCED AIR FORCE AUTHORITIES TODAY THAT HE ACTUALLY SAW AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WHICH MYSTERIOUSLY MADE AUTOMOBILE ENGINES STALL.

THE ENGINEER, COL. JOHN MCCURDY, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER FOR THE AIR FORCE MISSILE DEVELOPMENT CENTER AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS.

WHO WORKS AT THE CENTER, SAID HE MADE NOTES OF WHAT HE SAW WHEN HIS AND OTHER AUTOMOBILES STALLED ON U. S. HIGHWAY 54 AT WHITE SANDS YESTERDAY. HE DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS EGG-SHAPED--"LIKE A PULLED-OUT PISTOL TARGET WITH RINGS AROUND IT."

SAID IT WAS ABOUT TWO MILES AWAY, AT AN ALTITUDE OF 3,000 TO 5,000 FEET.

COLONEL MCCURDY SAID HE WAS "PERSONALLY SATISFIED" WITH THE ENGINEERS STORY. MCCURDY SAID HE WOULD BE GIVEN A THOROUGH MEDICAL EXAMINATION AND A RADIATION COUNT TEST.

LATER TODAY, COLONEL MCCURDY DISCLOSED THAT RADAR TECHNICIAN DON CLARK, 32, REPORTED A "STATIONARY CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT GIVING OFF AN ORANGE GLOW" OVER THE SAN ANDRES MOUNTAINS AT 4:34 A.M. MST (GMT-6 A.M. EST).

CLARK SAID THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 300 FEET LONG AND 100 FEET THICK, AND HOVERED IN THE SKY 15 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON.

STOCKS SAID HE AND 10 OTHER MOTORISTS WERE STALLED WHEN THE OBJECT CAME IN SIGHT.

HE SAID, "I BELIEVE THE OBJECT OR PHENOMENA WAS CONTROLLED BY AN INTELLIGENCE."

TWO MILITARY PATROLS REPORTED SUNDAY THAT THEY OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE SKY OVER THE ISOLATE "TRINITY" SITE AT WHITE SANDS WHERE THE FIRST ATOM BOMB WAS EXPLODED IN 1945. RESIDENTS AT SANTA FE AND ALAMOGORDO, AT DURANGO, COLO., AND AT CASPER, WYO., ALSO REPORTED TODAY THEY HAD SEEN SUCH OBJECTS.

COLONEL MCCURDY SAID MAJ. GEN. LEIGHTON I. DAVIS, COMMANDER OF THE MISSILE DEVELOPMENT CENTER, APPOINTED A CENTER CO-ORDINATOR TODAY TO MAKE AN "OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION" OF THESE REPORTS. MCCURDY SAID THE AIR FORCE WAS TRYING TO LOCATE OTHER MOTORISTS WHOSE CARS WERE SAID BY STOCKS TO HAVE BEEN STALLED ALONG WITH HISTORIES OF WHAT AND OTHER SCIENTISTS AT THE CENTER HAD THEIR OWN THEORY ABOUT WHAT THE OBJECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN, BUT HE WOULD NOT DISCUSS THIS THEORY AT THE CENTER.

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201

June 1, 1965

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Box 9494
PTD Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

This is a report on the very old sighting of November 4, 1957, made by two police officers and a fireman riding in one patrol car at shortly after 3:00 a.m., in Elmwood Park, Illinois.

I monitored the making of this part of the NBC documentary on UBC's, as I did on the previous night at Elk Grove Village, on the evening of May 27, 1965. Fortunately, all three witnesses are still holding down the same jobs, but only two were available for interview on this evening. The names of the witnesses were Officer and Officer.

All men stated that the incident had been reported to but that another had merely said that they had nothing on their screens. Here's another case where a failure to follow through and report a sighting.

Officer was all on the night of the filming, for the documentary, but I did talk at length with Officer and with the fireman. Both are. Before passing any final judgment, I would like to talk with Officer if I ever get the chance. If there had been only one witness of the caliber of either of the two I interviewed, I would tend to dismiss the incident as the product of an over-wrought imagination. However, with three witnesses, with three officers being on active duty, I feel that something was definitely sighted. Furthermore, the sighting occurred the day after the Levelland, Texas, case, and the description is quite similar. However, it was determined that these men had no knowledge of the Levelland sighting of the previous day. They stated that after they came back to the station house at dawn, the morning Tribune had just been delivered, and in thumbing through the pages, they came across an account of the Levelland sighting. They made a definite point of surprise with which they met the Texas account.

November 4, 1957, Elmwood Park, Ill., Sighting

The similarity to the Loveland case is striking and if we can believe (I think we can) that they were unaware of the Loveland sighting at the time they made theirs, it becomes all the more interesting. The object definitely passed in front of objects from time to time and the object could not be seen through the light. The object, or the illumination, was not transparent.

No sound or noise was ever associated with the object. It seemed to glow and its color was compared by both men to the color of a setting sun, but not as bright.

It is unfortunate that the incident did not occur to witnesses better trained as observers, and more articulate ones.

Other small items: _______ said that his "hair stood on end" when he saw the object, and the other officer said the _______ wanted to shoot at it, but was cautioned by Officer _______ not to shoot until he knew more about it.

Meteorological conditions for this night should be checked to be compared with similar data from Loveland. Likewise, comparison should be made with the Lock Raven Dam case and the Swiss equivalent of the Lock Raven Dam case which occurred just two or three days before the Lock Raven Dam case.

I would recommend that all cases of luminous globes of light which apparently do not appear to be attached to a tangible object be collected and be examined for similarities of behavior and ambient conditions. We may have here, and I say just possibly, have an indication of something more than one-witness cases.

This case should not be closed until I have a chance to talk with either a feeling that I have a feeling that something which will strongly corroborate the above or throw it out of court.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek

Chicago(Elmwood Park), Ill.

About 3:15 a.m. on November 4th came a report from suburban Chicago: three Elmwood Park police officers and a fireman saw a low-hovering 200-foot cylindrical object, red-orange in color, above a nearby cemetery; they said it appeared to be "rolling into itself" until they threw their pencil car searchlight on it, at which time it began "puffing out." At this point, the searchlight dimmed and almost went out. The object began moving off in a westerly direction and although the men tried to follow it in their car, it quickly disappeared from view--by "folding into itself."

Dear Mr:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 1 August 1959 concerning various UFO sightings.

Research of Air Force records indicates that the 4 November 1957 sighting you mention has never been reported to the U. S. Air Force.

The 5 November 1957 Coast Guard sighting was evaluated as several aircraft on the radarscope.

The 24 February 1959 American Air Lines sighting was attributed to jet night aerial refueling operation. The Pacific sightings of 11 July 1959 were attributed to an exceptionally bright and large meteor called "Fireball."

Sky in Florida

COCOA BEACH, FLA. (AP) - A missile bright as a star was seen in the sky over Florida early today, and witnesses said it appeared to come into a bright point of light.

Sky watchers at Cape Canaveral, home of the missile launching site, said the missile was seen going southeast from the launching site when it was about three miles high.

The missile began to level off at about two minutes after launching, witnesses said.

From the launching area, which is about 10 miles from the east-side of Cape Canaveral, the missile was seen to go south of Cape Canaveral.

Chicago, Illinois

Gentlemen:

I have been trying to learn the conclusions by the Air Force of two sightings of unidentified flying objects in this area.

Correspondence with Lt. Col. L.J. Tacker, Office of Information, Washington, has brought a statement that they were not reported to Officials at O'Hare AFB, an Identification much have been made by these officials, thereby ending the necessity of forwarding the reports to ATIC (as per AFR 200-2, section 9).

If, however, they were not identified and not reported, this would constitute a violation of AFR 200-2, section 4, paragraph a.

Information regarding these sightings follows:

(a) 4 Nov 1957 - Elmwood Park, Ill.-early morning. Two policemen and a fireman in a patrol car saw and attempted to follow a red-orange object that, at times, maneuvered at low altitudes. At one time, the lights on the patrol car dimmed, apparently due to the presence of the object. This object was immediately reported to O'Hare AFB and the witnesses were questioned by Air Force officers.

(b) 19 Jul 1958 - Des Plaines, Ill.- early morning. Three men at corner of Lee & Algonquin, Des Plaines, saw a bright red object pass overhead, silently, hover momentarily over O'Hare, then take off at very high speed. Sighting was reported to Des Plaines Police at 0345 hrs, 19 July. (Record Bureau Number 31335). The following day, Des Plaines contacted O'Hare and reported the sighting. The Des Plaines Journal also contacted Air Force officials.

I would like to know the official conclusion in these cases in accordance with AFR 200-2, section 9.

Respectfully yours;

8 September 1959

Dear Mr.

This is in regard to your letter of 4 September concerning UFO sightings in the Chicago area.

As stated in my previous letter, neither of the sightings you refer to (Elwood Park, Illinois and O'Hare Air Force base) were reported to the Air Technical Intelligence Center. Since neither of these sightings were reported to ATIC, they must have been positively identified as familiar objects by the Commander of O'Hare Air Force Base when they were reported to that installation. This is in accordance with paragraph 9 of AFR 200-2.

In this case, it is not essential that the report be presented to ATIC. Suggest you contact the O'Hare Information Office with respect to these two sightings.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TUCKER

September 4, 1950

Major L.W. Tacker
Monthly Staff Officer
Public Information Division
Office of Information Services
Pentagon Building
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Tacker:

In your letter to me dated Sept. 2, 1950 regarding Four UFO sightings, you noted that a UFO sighting in Elmwood Park, Ill. on Nov. 4, 1957 was never reported to the USAF.

Now your information, the U.S. Air Force officials, in unison, questioned on 3 Jan. 1958 by two Air Force officers at the Air Force Base. The witnesses were also questioned.

On Feb. 18, 1958, you wrote to me that a sighting occurring at O'Hare AFB, Chicago had been reported.

The local newspaper (the Des Plaines Journal) and one of the witnesses called the Air Force Base about the sighting.

Now, one of two things are happening:

Either you, or your source of information, is holding out on the central public. If this is so, it may be necessary to notify, or write to the Illinois Congressman in the future in order to obtain information.

The other possibility is that someone is clearing up some discrepancies so far not done. So on 3 Feb. 1958, with reference to AFR 200-2, Section A, subsection 1, paragraph a ("Reporting" reads: Commanders of Air Force base will gather all information and evidence of sightings including the "occurrence, date, time, course, Government, scientific, and civil and other relevant data.")

I have always tried to co-operate with the Air Force by reporting things in this program to observe and I think it is only fair that I state these facts.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

Dear Major Coleman:

On 10 June 1961, at your request, I sent you information regarding a sighting of an unidentified flying object over Rushville, Nebraska early in January, 1951. I would appreciate knowing, in accordance with AFR 200-2, section 8, the outcome of the official study into this sighting.

Would you please send me a copy of the latest DOD News Release on the subject?

On 7 August 1961, I requested information regarding two Chicago-area sightings. (4 Nov 57, Elmwood Park; 19 Jul 59, Des Plaines, Ill.) I have been trying to obtain information about these incidents for over a year. If I cannot get it through normal channels, I may be forced to seek assistance, as I have done before.

On 11 September 1961, I requested information regarding a series of UFO reports (30 Aug 61; 5 Sep 61) over Cincinnati, Ohio. I would like to know the official conclusion in this case, in accordance with AFR 200-2, section 8.

Major, I have a considerable amount of patience and I feel you are competent for the work you are doing. I hope you will provide the information requesting, thereby insuring that both these characteristics will remain unchanged.

Sincerely,

4/1

ASTRONOMY
Science News Letter for October 26, 1957

Venus Most Prominent
a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the
Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

▶ THAT BRILLIANT object you see in
the southwestern sky these evenings as darkness falls is not an airplane, a flying saucer,
or any other mysterious object, but Venus
at an experiment.

What you see is the planet Venus, now
reaching its greatest prominence, which
comes just before its disappearance from
the evening sky early in 1958.

Venus is far brighter than any other star
now in the sky, and it is so bright that there
is no difficulty in identifying it. Indeed, it
can be observed long before the sky is dark.
In fact, if you know where to look, you can
even see it in broad daylight!

After it passed behind the sun, Venus lost
its usual brightness for several weeks, then
followed the sun in its daily motion across
the sky, and so remained visible in the west
after the sun had set. On Nov. 18 it will
be farther east of the sun, hence remaining
in the sky for longer time after sunset, nearly three hours. After that it will start
moving toward the sun again.

Because of its early setting, Venus does
not appear on the accompanying maps of
the November evening sky, which show
their appearance about 10:00 p.m., your own
local standard time, at the first of November, 9:00 p.m. on the 15th and 8:00 p.m. on
the 30th.

Bright Birds in the Sky
These maps do, however, show the stars
that are now visible.

Toward the west is Deneb, at the top of
the "northern cross," which is really part
of the constellation of Cygnus, the swan.
Deneb is in the bird's tail; in fact, the word
represents the wings. The crosspiece
represents the wings, and the lower part of
the cross is the body of the swan apparently in flight. At the head is Albireo, a star of
the second magnitude on the astronomical
brightness scale. Below Cygnus is another
first-magnitude star, Vega, in Lyra. The lyre
to the left is another bird, Aquila, the
eagle, with the star Altair.

In the sky for longest time after sunset are
stars that form the "great square," part of
the constellation of Pegasus, the winged
horse. Although these are not among the
brightest, their characteristic arrangement
makes them a good group to watch. The stars
which form this "great square" are the stars
in the constellation of Pegasus, the horse.
The star at the upper right, Alpheratz, is

will in the coming months.
Then you will
see them high in the south.

Just above Orion is Taurus, the bull, with
brilliant Aldebaran, and to the left of this
figure stands Auriga, the charioteer, with
first magnitude Capella.

Although only Venus is now visible in
the evening sky, the planets appear in the
southeast before sunrise. Brightest of these
is Jupiter, in the constellation of Virgo, the
virgin. It is close to the bright star Spica.
However, it exceeds the star in brilliance
about an hour before sunrise.

Farther east is Mars, rising about an hour
ahead of the sun. Its brightness is about
half that of Spica. Mercury and Saturn
are both too near the sun to be visible
in November.

Shower of "Stars" to Come
November is the month bringing one of
the year's famous showers of meteors, or
"shooting stars," which appear from about
the middle to the end of the month.

They are most numerous after midnight,
because then we are on the forward side of
the earth in its annual movement around
the sun. Thus, we meet them head-on.
This is different from the evening hours
when we are on the rear part, and see
only those that catch up to us.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for October 26, 1957

DIE FIELDS

ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY

Worms Learn Best
In Evening Hours

► A WORM can be taught to turn in a special direction, but is learning ability is at its best in the evening hours.

At least this was found for one particular kind of earthworm, Lumbricus
terrestris, Dr. Jack Arthur of U. S. Army Biological Laboratories, Fort Ord, Calif., reports in Science (Oct. 4).

The worm was taught by a system of reward for the correct turn or punishment if it went the wrong way. When the worm was placed in a T-shaped pathway, it would go to the end of a pathway a little less than six inches long. The reward was just what an earthworm might enjoy most—some moist earth and moss in a darker covered pathway.

If the worm failed to move at all, it was urged into action by a gentle tickling with a soft brush. If it then did not get it started, a flashlight was turned on and held shining just behind it.

The worm was considered to have "passed" on the course if it reached the moist earth without being shocked seven consecutive times.

The experiments were done in the evening between 8 p.m. and midnight and repeated in an average of 32 tries, morning class, between 8 a.m. and noon, required 45 tries.

TECHNOLOGY

Radar Sets Can
Be "Blinded"?

► A COUNTER-MEASURE to radar detection—"blind is eye"—has been discovered by a British firm. It offers the first possibility that radar warning defense can be defeated, whether the attack is made by bombers or guided missiles.

The new material provides foam from rubber or synthetic rubber, which is claimed to be ceramics.

It is claimed that using the material provides new standards of navigational safety for aircraft and shipping by eliminating the hazards of radar-controlled missiles that have already been made on ships' tunnels and airport buildings. The structures covered with the material become invisible to a radar beam.

The Plessey Company technicians, developed this material, explain that the new material is a special type of radar-absorbent moment. Instead of bouncing back to the eye-cant receiver, they are absorbed by the rubber covering. As a result, no tell-tale radar echoes are returned.

(The basic principle of radar is that it sends out a constant series of pulses, like tennis balls fired in split-second succession. The pulses bounce back when they hit an object such as a plane or building. The receiver which records the return pulses automatically works out the height, range and position of the detected object.)

Until this material is invented there has been no means of fixing radar detection. Now the British auto drivers are already inquiring whether the material can be fitted to their cars to make them invisible to police so as to avoid speed traps. A system employed by the police to detect excessive speeding, it is likely to be made illegal to have an auto fitted in this way.

BIOCHEMISTRY

Secret of Aspirin's
Action Is Revealed

► ASPIRIN, the most familiar drug in mankind's medicinal chest, goes to work when the pituitary gland changes its into an enzyme which is a protein, according to Prof. John E. Christian and Ross Godfree of the Purdue University School of Pharmacy have found.

They knew that gentisic acid has the same effect as aspirin, minus aspirin's toxicity. They also know that rheumatic fever patients and others who take large doses of aspirin experience more gentisic acid than is normally present. So they devised an experiment to discover whether gentisic acid is a breakdown product of aspirin and where this process takes place.

First they induced fever in rats by feeding them a peptone solution. Then they injected aspirin labeled with carbon-14 into the rats. Forty-five minutes later, their adrenal and pituitary glands were found to accumulate, according to earlier experiments under Prof. Christian's direction.

In the pituitary, the body's "master gland," they found gentisic acid. It was labeled with carbon-14. In none of the other organs in which aspirin accumulates was this combination found.

Gentisic acid is an oxidized product of aspirin, which is less toxic than aspirin itself. Of a hydrolysis product of a hydroxyl group.

The pituitary gland contains large amounts of vitamin C, which is an oxidizing agent. Further, the pituitary gland is the next door neighbor to the body's heat control center in the posterior portion of the brain, the hypothalamus.

The scientists are now prepared to believe that a modified gentisic acid is safer than aspirin itself.

PHYSICS

Magnetic Phenomenon
Yields "Super Magnets"

► EXPERIMENTAL magnets with "one track mind" promise to be the first really permanent magnets. They will resist having their magnetic alignment taken away by every method except high temperatures.

The new magnets are made by putting an oxide coating over very small particles of a magnetic material such as cobalt metal. These particles are then heated to high temperatures in a strong magnetic field, forming a very powerful magnet that cannot be demagnetized by another magnetic field working against it.

The magnets are said to exhibit the phenomenon of "exchange anisotropy," preventing the usual decay of permanent magnets, and the first new magnetic anisotropy seen in 60 years, reported the discoverer of the magnetic substances, William H. Meiklejohn of the General Electric Research Laboratories, Schenectady, N.Y.

Anisotropy is an effect in magnetics that causes the magnetic alignment of the south alignments of magnetization.

The rare effect was found to be caused by the oxide coat on the metal particles, which though unaffected by magnetic fields, can at low temperatures pull metal atoms into magnetic alignment. Like railroad tracks guiding a train, the adjacent metal particles "magnetically aligned," but their effect is only good at low temperatures, which favor the oxide's orientation.

At present, Mr. Meiklejohn is working on other materials which show promise as anisotropic substances, and hopes that they will exhibit exchange anisotropy at room temperature or higher.

SEISMOLOGY

Earthquakes Show
Ocean Floor Differences

► THE DISASTROUS earthquakes in Turkey last April have given scientists new knowledge of the crust of the earth under the Mediterranean Sea, it is indicated in a report to Nature (Oct. 12).

The earthquake waves picked up on the seismograph at Kivu Living in the Belgian Congo show the structure of the sea bottom in the region from what is south of Greece, Dr. J. Cl. Heremans of the Institut pour la Recherche Scientifique en Afrique Centrale at Kivu Living reports.

Study of earthquake waves at sea in this region is urged by Dr. De Hernandez. The exact nature of the differences observed would have important implications for our knowledge of the earth's crust.

Here is the text from the document:

The moon will be just past last quarter, rising around midnight, so its light may interfere a little with the meteor display, although not as much as if there were a full moon.

Around 2:00 a.m., perhaps, a dozen or two meteors may be seen an hour, apparently radiating from a point in the eastern sky in the constellation of Leo, the lion. Because of this, the shower is known as the Leonids.

Actually, the meteors are moving in a great circular swarm around the sun, which the earth crosses at this time of year, so their motion is parallel. The effect of seeming to radiate from Leo is one of perspective. Their tracks converge in the distance, like the parallel tracks of a railroad.

Meteors Come in Cycles

These meteors take about 33 years to encircle the sun, and at one point they are much more numerous than elsewhere. In 1833 and 1866 the earth encountered this concentration, and there was a brilliant display, with meteors seemingly coming down almost like snowflakes.

By the next two times around, in 1899 and 1932, the dense cluster had been much reduced. In these years, the earth passed near the attraction of Jupiter, as it had passed near it. In these years, instead of a good display, the Leonid meteors were quite poor.

Despite the bombardment of the earth by these, and other meteor showers, the meteors do not reach the ground. They are thin things, no larger than pinheads, and are completely burned by friction as they encounter the resistance imposed by the earth's atmosphere.

There are also stray meteors, not connected with any regular shower. Once a while these are large enough to survive the passage through the atmosphere. One of the largest meteorites discovered is that found, along with two smaller ones, in Greenland in 1891. It measures 11 by 7 by 5 feet and weighs 365 tons.
