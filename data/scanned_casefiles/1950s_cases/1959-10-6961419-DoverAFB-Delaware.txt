No Case (Information Only)   18 October 1959   Warsaw, Poland

WARSAW, OCT. 15 (UP) -- THE MYSTERIOUS GLOW IN THE SKY, APPEARED OVER POLAND LAST NIGHT, HUNDREDS OF POLISH RESIDENTS OF STALINSTOK NEAR THE POLISH-RUSSIAN BORDER SAW A LUMINOUS OBJECT MOVING IN SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION AT ABOUT 5:10 P.M. LAST WEEK. SEVERAL INHABITANTS OF WARSAW, WHO LAST WEEK MAILED A NEWS BULLETIN OVER A CRACK SOVIET PRESS CENSORSHIP, WERE CONVINCED THEY WERE SEEING THE RETURN OF THEIR ROCKET.

POLISH NEWS AGENCY PAP, HOWEVER, SUGGESTED THE BRIGHT OBJECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CELESTIAL PHENOMENON. SOME EXPERTS OR AN EXPERIMENTAL BALLOON. THE EXACT NATURE REMAINS UNCLEAR.
