STATEMENT

On 4 Dec 1952 I went on duty as 0900 hours as a Plan Position Indicator Operator at the tactical Air Direction Center (TADC) at Congaree Air Force Base, S.C. At approximately 1000 hours I observed on my radar scope an unidentified target, which appeared to be moving westerly at a speed of approximately 800 knots. This target was designated a "track" and at approximately 1005 hours it passed within 10 miles of the radar station. 

As it passed the station I watched it carefully and estimated its speed to be well over 800 knots. I called the Controller and informed him of the situation. He acknowledged my report and told him that I had an unusual target. At this time the target was at a range of 59 miles and its course was 270 degrees. At this time the target flared up and indicated that it had slowed down to approximately 400 to 500 knots. It then accelerated again to approximately 800 knots and proceeded on a westerly course. 

At approximately 1015 hours the target was at a range of 99 miles. The target stopped at 112 degrees for approximately 3 minutes, then came back to 99 degrees and continued westerly. The speed was estimated at 800 knots. The target then disappeared at 99 miles.

The elapsed time from first sighting to disappearance was approximately 0347 hours. The speed was estimated at approximately 6,000 miles per hour.

The text in the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED
Congaree Air Force Base, South Carolina
4 December 1952

I. Description of Incident:
One unidentified object was sighted by radar at Congaree AFB at 0342 EST on 3/20/52. The object was sighted 100 miles NE of the radar site, traveling at an estimated speed of 6,000 mph which contrasted 5 minutes. The weather at the time consisted of low stratus clouds, no precipitation, and winds of 5 mph.
All observers were airmen graduates of operators school with between two to five years experience and considered excellent and reliable sources.

II. Discussion of Incident:
Several past radar sightings of this type have been received by ATIC and evaluated as probable interceptions or mistaken identity. This incident may fall into this category eventually in that the excessive speed of 6,000 mph plus the object's coherence to the radar beam's sweep indicate that interference may have been present. However, not enough information has yet been gathered on local weather, temperature, and moisture conditions, so this incident will be carried as unknown until such information arrives.

III. Conclusion:
Unknown

STATEMENT

On the morning of 4 December 1952, I AIC Clarence C. I, was on duty as USAF interceptor controller on the 727th AC&W Squadron. I was controlling a jet interceptor aircraft which was attempting to intercept a high speed object. I only saw it for one long pass, when it stopped for approximately one minute, then came directly back in the path it was moving, and faded. This track was first picked up at 0340 by out station Thomas who was at the scope. It was around seventy miles from our station.

STATEMENT

On the morning of 4 December 1952, I, A/1C Ardean D. Patefield of the radar operators section did have the first hour off and was sitting in the scope normally used for controlling. This scope was in use for a party of 10 miles at approximately 2500 feet. While sweeping across the scope I spotted an unknown target approximately 10-15 miles out and as it approached the station I saw it pick up to 120 miles so as to pick up in the same track. I saw the track as 99 miles out breaking up in a westerly course.

STATEMENT

On the morning 4 December 1952, I /Ic 'Walter Hope, and I /c/20 Arthur A. Vallerie, had witnessed an incident which we were adjusting a scope when we heard one of the operators call that he had an unusual object on the scope and that it was moving very fast. It was to the screen and saw an object moving approximately 20 degrees per second. We checked the scope about 100 miles out. We observed the object for several minutes and it was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. After a few sweeps disappeared. To my knowledge this was no radar malfunction.
