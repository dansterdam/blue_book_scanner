STATEMENT

On 4 Dec 1952 I went on duty at 0800 hours as Plan Position Indicator at the Tactical Air Direction Center. At approximately 0315 hours a few scattered targets began to appear on my scope. At approximately 0342 hours a large armed on my scope, at 104 degrees at approximately 82 miles. This target was assigned as track 11, I then called in a continuation of its remaining bearing target. I observed this scope for track 11 was at 034 degrees for 29 miles. At that time the sweep was at approximately 360 degrees. Then it appeared at 052 degrees at 99 miles. I called the floor supervisor and told him that I had an unusual target. At this time the target had moved to 060 degrees at 99 miles. At this time the floor supervisor and I, A/2C Arthur A. all we and M/Sgt John F. Trainer discussed section came to the scope. Next sweep the target was at 089 degrees at 99 miles, then at 105 degrees at 99 miles, then to 112 degrees at 99 miles. The target then moved across for approximately three sweeps, the target then move back to 105 degrees at which time it disappeared. The above moves from 034 degrees at 99 miles to 112 degrees at 99 miles are consecutively sweeps of the antenna which is revolving at 4 revolution per minute. The target disappeared at approximately 0347 hours. The speed was estimated at approximately 6,000 miles per hour.

UNCLASSIFIED

Congaree Air Force Base, South Carolina                    4 December 1952

I.    Description of Incident:

One unidentified object was sighted by radar at Congaree AFB at 0342 EST by an AN/MPS-5 radar set. The sighting was strictly electronic, not visual. The object was digitized 100 miles NE of the radar site, traveling at an estimated speed of 6,000 mph with contact lasting 5 minutes. The weather at the time consisted of low stratus clouds, no precipitation, and winds KE at 5 mph.

All observers were airmen graduates of radar operator's school with between two to five years experience and considered excellent and reliable sources.

II.   Discussion of Incident:

Several past radar sightings of this type have been received by ATIC and evaluated as probable interference from another radar station. This incident may fall into this category eventually in that the excessive speeds of 6,000 mph object's sweep indicate the sweep's tendency to the radar "noise". However, not enough information has yet been gathered on local weather, temperature and moisture was. altitude, so this incident will be carried as unknown until such information arrives.

III.  Conclusion:

Unknown

On the morning of 4 December 1952, I A/1c Clarence W. Ives did see a target that was being called in and it was moving at a v-v high speed. I only seen it for one long move, then it stopped for approximately one minute, then came directly back in the path it was moving, and faded. This track was first picked up at 0840 by S/Sgt Thomas who was at the scope. It was around 69 miles from our sight.

STATEMENT

On the morning of 4 December 1952, I A/1C Arden D. Patefield of the Radar Operations Section was sitting at the scope normally used for controlling. This scope was set up for a range of 40 miles. At approximately 0240 3/4z Thomas picked up the fast moving track and reported it. I immediately adjusted the scope to pick up out to 120 miles so as to pick up the same track. I saw the track at 99 miles out traveling at a terrific speed in a Southern course.

On the morning 4 December 1952, I A/1C Walter Hopf, and I A/2C Arthur A. Waller of Radar Maintenance Section was in the Control Van and making a scope when we heard one of the operators call that he had an unusual object on the scope and that it was moving very fast. We went to the screen and saw an object moving approximately 20 degrees per sweep about 120 miles out. The object was moving Southeast. We watched the target for several sweeps until it slowed, stopped and after a few sweeps disappeared. To my knowledge this was no radar malfunction.
