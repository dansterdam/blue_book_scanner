Comments of the Preparing Officer:
1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that these objects were 
probably ulutery aircraft for the following reasons:

a. There were numerous aircraft that could probably have been in
the area at the time of the sighting.

b. Flight Service informed investigator that aircraft flying locals
or round robins are not reported to them, therefore, all of the aircraft that
could have been in the as at the time of the sighting were not known to
them, thereby, substantiating their statement. (Pars 3, Part Three, this 
report).

c. It was possible that Sources relative position to objects night
have prevented them from observing any additional lights on them or possibly
they could have been inoperative for one reason or another.

d. Sources stated one of the objects gained altitude at a high rate 
of speed. 3-47's are capable of flying at a high rate of speed.

e. The momentary bright light observed could very well have been 
an Aldis light, operated by a crew member of a 3-47, acknowledging the signal 
given by Source when he turned his landing lights on and off.

f. After object had climbed to an altitude of 9,700 feet, Sources
stated objects slowed down to about the same speed of their aircraft. Assu-
ing that the object was probably a 3-47, the slowing down could be attributed
to the fact that he was slowing down to make contact with a tanker on a re-
fueling mission. Investigator learned that this operation is performed at 
approsendately 120 to 200 miles per hour. Second object was probably the 
same thing on the same type of mission.

Comments of the Approving Officer:

1. Concur with the conclusion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting 
was probably caused by mititary aircraft.

2. It must be noted that a discrepancy in time exists in the reports. 
The summary of the report lists the time of sighting as 2135 CST. This time 
was obtained from the original report of the sighting {See References). This 
time, inasmuch as it was reported the day of the sighting, is presumed to be 
the correct one. The times of sighting given by the Sources treated in Parts
One and Two cannot be reconciled by this organization.

I. SOURCE: Captain
Address: Dallas 5, Texas
Age: 31
Occupation: Pilot, Trans-Texas Airlines
Education: 2½ years of college, civilian pilot school, Air Force pilot training
Qualifications: Former Air Force Pilot, presently Airline Captain

II. RELIABILITY: Source was reluctant to talk about objects as he was somewhat upset because he was being interviewed on the sighting. He felt that he had 
nothing to do with originating the preliminary report other than asking the AC&W site if he had company on his flight. In a roundabout way he was contacted by  
Flight Service at Carswell AFB, Texas, who sent in the preliminary report. After an explanation by the investigator he became cooperative and should be considered 
reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: One object was sighted on take-off from Shreveport, La. Airport at approximately 2030CST, 3 June 1957. Altitude of object 
was approximately 100 feet when first sighted. Source stated that the control tower called his attention to the object which appeared as a small light. Landing lights 
of Source's aircraft were flashed on and off and the object responded momentarily with a very brilliant light directed at his aircraft. Object then gained altitude, from a seemingly hovering position, at a high rate of speed. At this time another object was sighted at about the same altitude and having the same appearance as the 
first object. Source stated he then contacted the tower to ascertain whether they 
had both objects in sight. Tower had both objects in sight, using binoculars. Objects 
then paralleled course of Source's aircraft, moving at about the same speed, which 
was approximately 110 knots, only at a higher altitude than that of his own aircraft. 
At Conway, La., objects were still with them so Source decided to call GCO ATIS 
(653rd AC&W Sq) to see if they had objects on their weapon. An affirmative answer 
was received. Source compared the size and appearance of objects to that of a star; 
however, he mentioned that at one time he thought he could see the silhouette of an 
object, but would not make a definite statement to that effect. Source's aircraft continued to Lake Charles, La., where he landed. At this point, sight of objects was lost, apparently behind a cloud deck, moving in a southeasterly direction. Objects had been observed for approximately one hour.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was an intelligence individual who was sincere and cooperative. Source was surprised when he was approached by the investigator concerning the sighting, for the subject, as he stated, had been dismissed from his thoughts. It is the opinion of the investigator that Source could be considered reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source sighted an object at about the 2 o'clock position after his aircraft had taken off from the Shreveport, La. Airport at 2115 CST, 3 June 57. He was looking south when object was first noticed and was at an altitude of 500 feet. Object was at approximately 1000 feet and one half mile distant when first observed. At first, only a white light resembling a star was seen. Source stated the landing lights on his aircraft were turned on and that the object responded by brightening its light. Object then moved on a course of 170 degrees to an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet at a considerable speed, after which it appeared to maintain the same relative position to Source's aircraft for the next hour. At this time a second "star" appeared to the right and slightly above the first object. Source said that after second object was sighted, he and the Aircraft Captain (See Part One) decided to call Shreveport tower to see if they had objects in sight. The tower answered affirmatively, stating they had spotted them with binoculars. Both objects appeared as white lights and at times were hard to distinguish from stars. Source stated that they flew a track of 170 degrees after objects were sighted, for a distance of 62 nautical miles, and then to a uf 150 degrees. Object seemed to turn with them and at this time the Airplane Captain called GOATEE (653rd AC&W Sq) to inquire if they had objects on their scope. ______eplied that they had two targets at 9,700 feet. Sight of objects was lost while landing at Lake Charles, La. when last seen they were moving to the southeast.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. Airways Forecast Service was contacted for wind readings in area at the time of sighting. The winds were as follows:

Surface  — Southeast at 3 knots 
 6,000  — 170 degrees at 12 knots 
10,000  — 170 degrees at 24 knots 
16,000  — 140 degrees at 09 knots 
20,000  — 160 degrees at 29 knots 
30,000  — 160 degrees at 41 knots 
50,000  — 190 degrees at 11 knots

Other weather information was received from the Weather Officer, Headquarters 20th Air Division, Richards-Gebaur AFB, Missouri, who gets the information by relay from Barksdale AFB, La. At the time of sighting there was no ceiling, visibility of 7 miles and there were scattered clouds at 2000'. There was frequent lightning and thunderstorm activity in the area at the time of sighting.

2.  Contact was made with the controller at Goatee (653rd AC%% Squadron) through the facilities of Headquarters Central Air Defense Force. The controller had observed objects on his weapon and informed Flight 103 Trans-Texas Airlines when queried by them on observation of objects. There were no pictures made of the painting. Since objects did not appear unusual to the controller and they were not in an ADIZ, he saw no reason to file a report himself.

3.  Flight Service at Carswell AFB, Texas was contacted. They originated the preliminary report, and were unable to add anything to their original report, except that they did not have a flight plan or anything in the area of the sighting, at the specific time sighting was made.

4.  Base Operations at Lake Charles AFB, La. was contacted to ascertain if they had any flights logged in or out of their station during the period of the sighting. It was learned that they had a C-47 arriving at 2214 CST from Fort Worth, Texas and a C-46 arriving from Brookley AFB, Alabama at 2232 CST. It was also learned that there were 2 B-47's on normal radian that departed at 1921 CST and returned at 2312 CST and another that departed at 1935 and returned at 2302 CST.

5.  Base Operations at Barksdale AFB, La. was also contacted to determine if they had any traffic during the time of the sighting. Their logs revealed that there were numerous B-47's and KC-97's flying round robin refueling missions during the period of the sighting.
