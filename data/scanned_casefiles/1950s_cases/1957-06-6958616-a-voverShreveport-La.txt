Originating Agency: Det 2, 4602d AISS
Report No: D2-UFO-2-57
Date: AISS-UFO-129-57

Comments of the Preparing Officer:

1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that these objects were probably military aircraft for the following reasons:

a. There were numerous aircraft that could probably have been in the area at the time of the sighting.

b. Flight Service Informed Investigator that aircraft flying locals or round robins are not reported to them, therefore, all of the aircraft that could have been in the area at the time of the sighting were not known to them, thereby, substantiating their statement. (Para 3, Part Three, this report).

c. It was possible that Sources relative position to objects might have prevented them from observing any additional lights on them or possibly they could have been inoperative for one reason or another.

d. Sources stated one of the objects gained altitude at a high rate of speed. B-47's are capable of flying at a high rate of speed.

e. The momentary bright light observed could very well have been an Aldis light, operated by a crew member of a B-47, acknowledging the signal given by Source when he turned his landing lights on and off.

f. After object had climbed to an altitude of 9,700 feet, Sources stated objects slowed down to about the same speed of their aircraft. Assuming that the object was probably a B-47, the slowing down could be attributed to the fact that he was slowing down to make contact with a tanker on a refueling mission. Investigator learned that this operation is performed at approximately 130 to 200 miles per hour. Second object was probably the same thing on the same type of mission.

Comments of the Approving Officer:

1. Concur with the conclusion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by military aircraft.

2. It must be noted that a discrepancy in time exists in the report. The Summary of the report lists the time of sighting as 2135 CST. This time was obtained from the original report, or the narrative (See Remarks). This time, inasmuch as it was reported the day of the sighting, is presumed to be the correct one. The times of sighting given by the Sources treated in Parts One and Two cannot be reconciled by this organization.

I. SOURCE: Captain [redacted]
           Address: [redacted], Dallas 5, Texas
           Age: 34
           Occupation: Pilot, Trans-Texas Airlines
           Education: 2½ years of college, civilian pilot school, 
                      Air Force pilot training
           Qualifications: Former Air Force Pilot, presently Airline Captain

II. RELIABILITY: Source was reluctant to talk about objects as he was somewhat upset because he was being interviewed on the sighting. He felt what he had nothing to do with originating the preliminary report other than asking the ACCI site IE he had company on his flight. In a roundup very he was contacted by Flight Service at Carswell AFB, Texas, who sent in the preliminary report. After an explanation by the investigator he became cooperative and should be considered reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: One object was sighted on takeoff from Shreveport, La. Airport at approximately 2032 CST, 3 June 1957. Altitude of object was approximately 100 feet when first sighted. Source stated that the control tower called his attention to the object which appeared as a small light. Landing lights of Source's aircraft were flashed on and off and the object responded momentarily with a very brilliant light directed at his aircraft. Object then circled altitude, from a seemingly hovering position, at a high rate of speed. At this time another object was sighted at about the same altitude having the same appearance. First object. Source stated he then contacted the tower to ascertain whether they then had objects in sight. Tower had both objects in sight, maintaining contact. Objects were approximately 110 knots, only at a higher altitude than that of his own aircraft. At 6533rd AGB (Sq) object was approximately 110 knots to see if they had objects on their weapon. An affirmative answer was received. Some compared the sighting to a star, however, he mentioned that at one time he thought he could see the silhouette or outline of the object. Source continued to Lake Charles, La., where he landed. At this point, sight of objects was lost, apparently behind a cloud deck, moving in a southeasterly direction. Objects then seen observed for approximately one hour.

                        in college

II. RELIABILITY: Source was an intelligence individual who was sincere and
cooperative. Source was surprised when he was approached by the investigator concerning the sighting, for the subject, as he stated, had been dismissed from his
thoughts. In his opinion of the investigator that Source could be considered
reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source sighted an object at about the
2 o'clock position after his aircraft had taken off from Shreveport, La. Airport
at 2115 CST, 3 June 57. He was looking south when object was first noticed and was
at an altitude of 500 feet. Object was at approximately 1000 feet and one half mile
distant from first observed. At first, only a white light remained to be seen.
Source stated the landing lights on his aircraft were turned on and that the object
responded by blinking its light. Object then moved on a course of 170 degrees to
an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet at a considerable speed, after which it
appeared to maintain the same relative position to Source's aircraft. For the next
hour. At this time a second object appeared to be right and slightly above the
first object. Source said that after second object was sighted, he and the Aircraft
Captain (See Part One) decided to call Shreveport tower to see if they had objects
in sight. The tower answered affirmatively, stating they had spotted them with
instruments. Both objects appeared as white lights and at times were red to distinguish from stars. Source stated that they flew a track of 170 degrees after
objects were sighted, for a distance of 62 nautical miles, and then to a 110 of 150
degrees. Object seemed to turn with then and at the same time the Airline Captain
JONES (553rd ACW 5g) to inquire if they had objects on their scope. Proceeded
that they had objects on their scope. Sight of objects was lost while landing
at Lake Charles, La. When last seen they were moving to the southeast.

There was frequent lighting and thunderstorm activity in the areas at the time of sighting.

2. Contact was made with the controller at Goates (653rd AC&W Squadron) through the facilities of Headquarters Central Air Defense Forces. The controller had observed objects on his weapon and informed Flight 103 Trans-Texas Airline when queried by them on observation of objects. There were no pictures made of the training. Since objects did not appear unusual to the controller and they were not in an ADIZ, he saw no reason to file a report himself.

3. Flight Service at Carswell AFB, Texas was contacted. They originated the preliminary report, and were unable to add anything to their original report, except that they did not have a flight plan on anything in the area of the sighting, at the specific time sighting was made.

4. Base Operations at Lake Charles AFB, La. was contacted to ascertain if they had any flights legged in or out of their station during the period of the sighting. It was learned that they had a C-47 arriving at 2214 CST from Fort Worth, Texas and a C-46 arriving from Brookley AFB, Alabama at 2232 CST. It was also learned that there were 2 B-47II's on record having that had returned at 2312 CST and another that departed at 1935 and returned at 2302 CST.

5. Base Operations at Barksdale AFB, La. was also contacted to determine if they had any traffic during the time of the sighting. Their logs revealed that there were numerous B-47's and KC-97's flying round robin refueling missions during the period of the sighting.
