I. Description of Incident
At 2116Z a civilian woman located 16 miles northeast of Indianapolis sighted an unknown object resembling a balloon trailing a high altitude vapor trail in a northeasterly direction. This observation was confirmed by the USAF air defense personnel of the zone, the Indiana Army National Guard, and the U.S. Air Force installation. Clear weather prevailed.

II. Discussion of Incident
A public announcement was obtained that a pilot balloon weather balloon was scheduled for release at 2100Z by the Indianapolis U.S. Department of Agriculture Weather Station and possibly caused this observation. The object was seen approximately 15 minutes after the balloon's release from Indianapolis and was carried in a northeasterly direction by the winds aloft, for that time of day were from 210 to 240 degrees. This would place the free-floating 35" rubber balloon over Fortville, the location of sighting.

III. Conclusion
was balloon.
