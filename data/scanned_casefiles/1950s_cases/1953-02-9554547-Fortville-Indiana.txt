Fortville, Indiana                                                23 February 1953

I.   Description of Incident

At 2116Z time a civilian woman located 16 miles northeast of Indianapolis sighted an unknown flying object appearing as a circular shaped, white object traveling at a high altitude in a northeasterly direction and reported this occurrence to the 762nd ACW Squadron, the nearest Air Force installation. Clear weather prevailed.

II.  Discussion of Incident

Project Blue Book ascertained that a piball weather balloon was scheduled for release at 2100Z by the Indianapolis U.S. Department of Agriculture Weather Station and probably caused the submission of this report. The object was seen approximately 15 minutes after the balloon's release from Indianapolis and was carried in a northeasterly direction by the winds aloft which, for the time of day were from 210° to 250°. This would place the free-floating 30" rubber balloon almost over Fortville, the location of sighting.

III. Conclusion

Was balloon.
