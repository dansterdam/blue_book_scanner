Gentlemen:

May 26, 1959 A.F. Eastern D. 214th Time, Tuesday,
May 26, 1959 at I was on U. S. Rt. 20, east of (?) 
in Weston, Barbour County, W. Va. While I was (??)
I noticed a large meteor. I am sure you have seen 
a few unusual bright meteors, but I would like to 
describe this one. It was traveling into the tail as it fell. Direct I was 
aware of bright it was and looked as though it was going to the 
last west at the same time my mind of vision. It was 
almost due South and fell slightly to the west. I 
personally was driving east on U. S. Rt. 20 and was 
watching while are here.
