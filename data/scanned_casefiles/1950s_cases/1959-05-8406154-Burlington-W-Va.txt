1. This report was made on May 8, 1959, based on information received from Colonel John D. Whitted, QAC, Director of Operations, Headquarters Mid-Continental Air Defense Force, Ent Air Force Base, Colorado Springs, Colorado.
2. It was reported that on May 2, 1959, at approximately 2345 hours, a RAPCON radar operator at the Burlington, West Virginia Radar Site, observed an unidentified target on his radar scope. The target was tracked for approximately 10 minutes, during which time it covered approximately 13 miles. No visual observation of the target was made.
3. Colonel Whitted stated that this incident had been thoroughly checked and investigated, and that the radar site was a reputable and reliable one. However, no positive identification of the target could be made.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO analysis report, titled "UFO ANALYSIS SHEET". The report provides details about a UFO sighting, including the location, date, time, and description of the observed object. The report also includes sections for recording details about the motion, astronomical phenomena, radar analysis, natural phenomena, and aircraft/balloons/airships. The final section contains the "Analysis and Conclusions" which describes the observer's account and notes that it is "more to describe rather than analyze."

Here is the text from the document:

Location Buckhannon, West Virginia
Date 26/2/59
Time 0247 Z 
Duration 3-5 minutes
Description 20-30 feet in diameter, disc-shaped, bright luminous, high speed

Direction of Motion FAST, JET-LIKE
Altitude (ESTIMATED) Above 6000
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) UNUSUALLY BRIGHT

Radar Analysis (AGAIN-LIL)

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.)

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.

Other 

Evaluation of Source Reliability CREDIBLE

Analysis and Conclusions: It is more to describe rather than analyze. The witness is a mature and reliable observer who gave a detailed account of the object which he watched for 3-5 minutes. The speed and maneuvering indicated it was not a conventional aircraft. It is unidentifiable and of considerable interest.
