The text I can clearly read on this document includes:

• "Glush Purple Glow"
• "White Lilacs"

There is a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be an oval or elliptical shape with some arrows and additional markings. Most of the underlying text appears to be illegible due to the image quality.

The document seems to be a page from a UFO-related report, with a hand-drawn diagram as the primary visual element.

STATEMENT

On the 22nd May 1955, three other airmen and myself were on the Denver highway coming back to the base for bed check when our car went out of gas. We pulled to a stop on a hill. About 10 miles from Cheyenne. We stopped a car on the highway and we told two of the other airmen to go get gas while Airman [redacted] and myself stayed with the car, between 2400 hours and 0100 hours. I looked out of the right front window and I saw a funny looking object it was shaped something like a pencil with a white light all around it. The object remained for about 10 seconds then disappeared. About one minute later it was there again, then there was a flash of light and there were two of them. As soon as they were out of sight suddenly in the spot they disappeared from there were two cone shaped objects they had a sort of white color at first then changed to a bluish purple color at first. Then as they moved skyward they kept getting brighter and I could see them glittering then they were gone from sight. Airmen Shapiro and myself just looked at each other, and I said I guess we should report it, so at 0730 Monday morning 23 May 1955 we reported what happened to M/Sgt Francis J. Martin. We were coming back from Greely on route 85 when this all happened.

S T A T E M E N T

Last night on the 22nd of May 1955 we were coming back to the base from Greeley. We were on route 85, ten out of us about 10 miles from Cheyenne, Wyoming. While two of my friends started to Cheyenne for gas, another and I started in the car. It all started happening somewhere between 2345 and 0030. said he saw something but didn't know what it was. I took a look out the window. It disappeared in a minute and then returned, only this time there were two of them. They were there for about five minutes, and then they disappeared completely. A few minutes later there appeared in the sky moving objects, two of them. There were two lights one on each side of the moving objects. They started moving south, flying not too high. Every couple of minutes it would turn a bluish purple, almost as bright as a light. This is when I caught a glance as to what it was shaped like. I'll try and come as close as possible.

She was in sight for about ten minutes, then it ascended almost straight up and toward the south.
