AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

19th Bombardment Group, Medium                   IR-3-52                       PAGE    2    OF    2    PAGES

At 0104H on 23 Aug 52 over XE 20/1, aircraft 6359, which was scheduled for weather reconnaissance in the Sinuiju area, sighted an unidentified object. The aircraft was on a heading of 044 degrees at an altitude of 22,000 feet, weather was 1/8 to 3/8 undercast with no moon. The sighting was made by the Airborne Commander, Aircraft Commander, Pilot, Bombardier, C.W.O. and Right Scanner. The object was described as appearing to be 6 or 7 feet long, clear shaped, orange-red in color and red particles approximately 1 ft in diameter appearing to shoot off at right angles from the path of flight of the object. No trail was seen but the whole object seemed to glow with an orange-red color. The object was first seen at the 3 o'clock level position approximately 300 feet away. It was traveling up at an angle of 45 degrees approximately, paralleling the heading of the B-29 and disappeared when it was 150 feet above the aircraft's altitude. The sighting lasted not more than 3 seconds after it was first seen. Speed of object was estimated as over 300 MPH. The experience level of this crew is 1st combat missions and all concur on the above sighting. No other information is available.
