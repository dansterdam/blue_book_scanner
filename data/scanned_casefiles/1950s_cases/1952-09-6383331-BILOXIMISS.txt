SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Use appropriate paragraphs. List enclosures in lower left. Begin last page of report on AF Form 112-Part 2(S))

1. At approximately 2110 hours, CST, 14 September 1952, Mr. [redacted] sighted unidentified flying objects in the sky East of his position at the Redwing Reservoir, Pass Christian, Mississippi. The objects were reported to being disc-shaped and presentable in color. The clear objects ranged from 3 to 5 in number and in a constant position small 11 degrees to less immediately, the first object was seen by the observer in the normal intensity of the light of a cloud, at which time the object appeared to move in a horizontal direction at a high rate of speed. Approximately 10 (5) minutes later, the first object renewed to the same position. This object remained in a constant position from 2110 hours, CST, to 2210 hours, CST, at which time a second object, finally, a third object was observed. The observer was in a position to observe the first object, finally, a third object. The size of the objects was estimated to be from 1/2 to 2 inches along the horizon as seen from the three objects. The observer was able to estimate the size and altitude as given. The observer made no attempt to make any sounds using from the three objects.

2. The remaining of the unidentified objects lasted approximately from 2110 hours to 2210 hours, CST, which time the objects were observed to fade out.

FINDINGS

1. Shape:
The shape of the objects was reported as being primarily clear-shaped but, as the objects lost their intensity, they assumed the shape of a half-moon.

2. Size:
The observer estimated the size of the objects as being comparable to the size of the moon plus four (4) inches along the circumference.

3. Color:
The objects were described as being ground-white in color.

4. Number:
Three (3).

5. Formation:
Two (2) objects were in the sky east of observer's ground position, and three (3) were. A third object appeared considerably 200 or the first two objects.

6. Aerodynamic Features:
No aerodynamic features were observed.

7. Trail or Exhaust:
No trail or exhaust was observed.

8. Propulsion System:
None observed.

9. Speed:
No estimation of speed was given by the observer. Observer stated that the impression is received was one of merely disappearing without any sense of speed.

10. Course:
Negative.

11. Maneuvers:
The first object appeared, lost intensity, assumed half-moon shape and...

STATEMENT

At approximately 2110 hours, 14 September 1952, I, the undersigned was parked at a drive-in theater in Biloxi, Miss. Suddenly, then I sighted an unidentified object in the sky. At first, the object appeared to be a cloud, with a tie appearing to be six (6) miles long. The object, which was seen as a large transparent mass of considerable size, was colored rather twice the normal intensity of the light of a cloud and remained in a constant position until it began to lose intensity. Losing in intensity, the object appeared to be a half-para, a shape and disappeared from sight, straight up.

Approximately five (5) minutes later, the object returned to the same position with a gradual intensity build-up. The object remained constant from 2120 hours until 2220 hours, as which time it broke up as and appeared as an animal gone strange. Finally, a third object appeared, East of the previous one. The sighting of the objects lasted until approximately 2300 hours when I left the theater.

I heard no sounds coming from the objects; I observed no searchlights, features or trails or cameras.

Mississippi, A
