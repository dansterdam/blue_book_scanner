This is an account of my experience of witnessing the presence of an object in the sky. I was flying in the lockhead [sic] LT-2 airplane with Mr. ___. At this time it was about 4:30 pm and we were flying at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. Suddenly, we noticed a metallic object which appeared to be a large silver disk or saucer-shaped craft, flying at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet and at a tremendous rate of speed.
While flying at the present altitude of 10,000 feet, I was able to observe the object for a period of approximately 15 minutes before it disappeared from our vision.
The object was flying at an estimated speed of 15,000 mph and at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. It was flying in a level course and the best of my knowledge appeared round in shape and metallic in nature. This object was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. Two other objects, seemingly smaller in size, were also observed flying in close proximity to the main object. The main object made no sound and left no trail of smoke or vapor.
The following day it was revealed that Mr. _____ had seen the identical object while standing on the ground at the same time. This coincidence is interesting and it is difficult to discount the possibility that the object was real. The similarity of the descriptions by both observers and the inability to logically explain the details other than the basic outline is impossible to discern anything but the basic outlines.

The document appears to be a typed report from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects. The report contains text describing an incident observed by a witness on December 28, 1953 in Agoura, California.

The text of the report is as follows:

"DOCUMENTED AIRCRAFT CORPORATION 
CALIFORNIA DIVISION 
Air Force, U.S.

To: OSI Intra-Flight Post Files  
From: EUGENE GAUGER.

On December 28, 1953, I was aboard my C-54 airplane, VL 3301, with passengers, which was approximately 7 miles southwest of Agoura, California, at 12,000 ft.

At about 8:00 PM we observed the California Avalon and Palos Verde hills) at 10,000-12,000 ft. on the top of a mountain in the Pacific Ocean. The night was clear, and the sky above the mountain was clear. Our attention was called to this object as it drifted slowly over the mountain. We were roughly paralleling the object as it moved. We had a good, unobstructed view of the object. It appeared to be a large airplane and we thought at first it was a C-54 rather than a jet (which we had not dealt with before). As we observed the object, it gradually appeared to go into a spiral dive and finally disappeared.

I was standing between the pilots and observed the object but it did not appear to be any conventional airplane. It made no sound and exhibited no navigation lights (toward the setting sun). We were approximately 7 miles from the object when we first noticed it. I have had considerable experience in aircraft observation and am quite familiar with all types of airplanes, both military and commercial, and this was definitely not any type of airplane I had ever seen before. The spiraling dive and final disappearance was rather unusual. It appeared to be hovering or standing still at times during the observation."

Dear Colonel Weltenbaker:

I am enclosing a report, prepared by Chief Engineer of Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and some of his associates, on the subject of unidentified flying objects. This report is being handed to me by a Lockheed employee who professes to have seen flying objects and is actually considered to be a technical engineer. However, I thought you should have the report for whatever value it may be in your overall studies.

Best regards.

Sincerely yours,

CALIFORNIA DIVISION
WESTERN AERIAL OBSERVATION

December 18, 1953

To: Air Force Investigating Group on Flying Saucers

On Wednesday, December 16th, 1953, my wife and I went out to our back yard in the San Fernando Valley, California, and saw what appeared to be a round, metallic object north of Ventura Blvd. We arrived there at about sundown, which is close to 5:19 P.M. P.S.T. We went immediately to our ranch house, which is located on a hill facing southwest.

At approximately 5 o'clock (while it was still daylight), I was looking out of the window when I noticed something in the sky. It appeared to be a black saucer-like object, which was hovering and seemed to be oscillating slightly back and forth. It was not going down or up, just seemed to be stationary. The whole object was very clear and distinct, and was colored a dark gun-metal grey.

As I continued to watch, the object did not seem to change its position or altitude to any great degree. After watching it for several minutes, I called my wife to come and look. She confirmed that she could also see the object, and she said that it appeared to be a "saucer-like" object. After watching it for about three minutes, I do not know how long it was there.

When it did not move or change, I asked my wife to get me our night glasses, binoculars. I wanted to get a better look at the object, which by now I had recognized as the so-called "saucer". As soon as I focused the glasses on the object, it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed, and was gone. There was no trail or vapor or any other sign that it had been there. It was just there one second and gone the next. There was no sound whatsoever. The object appeared to be about the size of a fifty-cent piece held at arm's length. The color was a dark gun-metal grey. Its outline was very distinct and sharply defined.

In 60 seconds from the time it started to move, the object had completely disappeared. It had achieved a fantastically high rate of speed, much higher than any aircraft I have ever seen. I would estimate the speed to be several thousand miles per hour. There was no acceleration visible, it was just a sudden burst of speed and it was gone. The object was heading in a generally northerly direction when it disappeared.

On the morning of December 17th, I reported to work, having been impressed by the sighting and wanted to advise my supervisor, Mr. [REDACTED], that I had seen an unidentified flying object.

FLYING SAUCER*

On Wednesday, December 16, 1952, I participated in a test flight of a Navy Jet Fighter Constellation UV-42, taking off at 10:35 p.m. The flight was over Catalina channel and we climbed out over the ocean and reached an altitude of 20,000 feet. At 10:50 p.m. something approached the plane from the right side and passed overhead behind us at a distance estimated to be 4,000 feet. It appeared to be a very large object, possibly 100 feet in diameter, and it was moving at a speed estimated to be 20,000 feet per minute.
Several seconds later a second object approached from the left side and passed under the plane at about 10,000 feet. This object was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was moving at a rate of speed estimated to be 15,000 to 20,000 feet per minute.
It was a clear night, moonlight, and I could see the objects quite distinctly as they passed by. After they had passed, we made a gradual descent and landed at approximately 11:45 p.m.
Although the object appeared to be absolutely stationary, it did not seem to give off any light, nor did it have any visible means of propulsion. It was, however, quite large and apparently solid in appearance. There was no sound associated with either of the objects.
Looking back at the flight, I can say that it was recorded that the two objects were sighted at approximately 20:50 p.m. or just a little before that time. We continued with the test flight, and landed after the observation, at approximately 11:45 p.m. When we were on the ground, we discussed other details of the flight and then we were debriefed. I gave a written statement of what I had observed to my Duty and Administrative Officer at that time.

Text from the document:

This morning I reported to work and went directly to see Mr. Knight, Engelwood, to give him a report on activities concerning an unidentified flying object incident which I had covered some time ago. * * * * * Some time ago, I referred to the matter in my running log and suggested that it was a case that might warrant further investigation. At that time, I made a careful check of the records and examined the original file on the incident, I did not have sufficient information to warrant further investigation at that time. The case in question that I referred to concerned a sighting reported to the local police department by three young people who were driving along the highway near Agoura, California, sometime during the late evening hours of December 6, 1953. The police reported the incident to the Los Angeles Air Defense Filter Center and it was subsequently referred to me for investigation. WHAT I REPORTED: The case had been briefly covered in the log and the file included a statement from the police department and a report from the Los Angeles Air Defense Filter Center. The essence of the report was that the three young people had sighted an object in the sky which they described as brightly lit and traveling at a very high rate of speed. They reported that the object appeared to be about the size of a car and was observed for several minutes as it passed over the highway in a northeasterly direction. The police department stated that they had received several other calls reporting the same sighting. The Los Angeles Air Defense Filter Center stated that they had no record of any aircraft in the area at the time. CONCLUSION: Based on the limited information contained in the file, I was unable to arrive at any definite conclusion as to the nature of the sighting. I pointed out that while there was no evidence to indicate that the sighting represented anything more than the observation of some conventional aerial object, the fact that it had been reported by several independent witnesses and confirmed by the local police department warranted a more thorough investigation. However, in the absence of any physical evidence, such as photographs or other tangible data, and since there was no indication that the object posed any threat to the security of the country, I did not feel that further investigation was justified at that time. I indicated that the file would be retained for possible future reference should additional information become available. Chief Flight Test Engineer

FLYING SAUCER*

Capt. Hector C. Quintanilla, Jr.. USAF. 2273 d field, dated 31 Dec 53.

Capt. Quintanilla indicates that on 6 Dec 53, this office received a call from a 
I saw o strange object in the sky at about 11:00 p.m. on 5 Dec 53 It was described as being round in shape, about the size of a basketball, and yellowish-white in color. It appeared to be moving very fast and emitting a bright light. "I kept watching it for about 10 minutes and it seemed to get larger and brighter. Then it suddenly disappeared."

I was able to talk to the witness on 7 Dec 53. She said that she saw the object shortly after dark (about 5:30 p.m.) while driving home from work. The object was first seen to the northwest and traveled across the sky towards the southwest at a high rate of speed. She estimated the object to be about 20,000 feet in altitude and it disappeared from sight in about 10 minutes. She stated that she had never seen anything like it before and could not offer any explanation as to what it might have been.

She described the object as being round in shape, about the size of a basketball, and yellowishwhite in color. It appeared to be emitting a bright light but made no noise. She said that it seemed to get larger and brighter as it moved across the sky and then suddenly disappeared from sight.

According to the witness, she saw the object for about 10 minutes and from the time she first saw it until it disappeared, it traveled a considerable distance across the sky. From her description, it seems quite possible that the object could have been a meteor or some other astronomical phenomenon. However, the fact that it appeared to increase in size and brightness as it moved across the sky would tend to rule out a meteor as the explanation. Her statement that it suddenly disappeared from sight also seems difficult to explain in terms of a meteor. Could it possibly have been some type of aircraft or missile? It is indeed a puzzling sighting and one which I have not been able to fully explain.

I might add that I have had considerable experience in investigating UFO reports, and from what the witness has told me, this does not seem to be a typical UFO sighting. There are certain aspects of it that do not quite fit the pattern of most UFO reports that I have handled. However, I do not feel that I can completely rule out the possibility that this was some type of unusual aerial phenomenon. The witness appeared to be sincere and her description of the object was quite detailed. Perhaps additional information or reports from other sources might help to provide a more satisfactory explanation.
