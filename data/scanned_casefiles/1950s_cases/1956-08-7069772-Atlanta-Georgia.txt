11. COMMENTS
Obviously a/c. Preparing officer
reports low flying a/c observed
in area. Also F-84's in Dobbins
AFB known to be in area at time
of sighting. Interviewer w/observer

In view of above information and
fact that observer practically
describes a "jet aircraft" in her
description of the object, conclude
as a/c.
