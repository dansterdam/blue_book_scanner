Southeast

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Aircraft of unidentified type observed by American Air Lines pilot flying 20,000 feet over the Sange de Cristo range. There were no vapor trails or other distinguishing characteristics observed which might assist in the particular a/c type.

11. COMMENTS
Immediate identification of object observed by commercial pilot as being a type of unres- ognized a/c produces investigation on basis of sighting being a UFO. Due to scattered cloud conditions at all altitudes & limited visibility it is highly possible that under better conditions this experienced pilot could have better determined the exact type a/c. No Inves.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical

11. COMMENTS
Immediate identification of object obtained by commercial airlines pilot as being a type of unrecognized aircraft near Walsenburg, Colorado in the beam of this sighting being a UFOB. Due to scattered cloud conditions at all altitudes and limited visibility it is highly possible that under better conditions this experienced pilot could have better determined the exact type of this aircraft. No investigation authorized.
