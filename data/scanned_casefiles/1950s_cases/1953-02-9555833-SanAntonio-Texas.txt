STATEMENT

Upon completion of a tour of duty from 1600 to 2400 27 February 1953, I left the building in which I had just been relieved from duty when an officer and several airmen who were standing outside brought to my attention what they considered to be a flying saucer. I looked up and saw a light moving over the field on a heading of east. I said to the men that it was probably a weather instrument of some kind from Kelly Air Force Base. I took a few more steps toward my automobile when I decided to have another look. The object seemed to be at high altitude and it was picking up speed in a climb. Its size appeared to be slightly larger than the average star and its color had more of an orange tint than the average star. When the P-25 when the distance was too far. The thing was that there was absolutely no sound involved from the object as it crossed the sky. The weather was crystal clear at this time. The surface winds were calm.

The object continued climbing until it went out of sight. I got into my car and drove approximately one block when I was stopped by a group of men stand out in the street pointing toward the sky. I stopped the car and got out for a look. At this time the object, I am assuming that was the same one that I saw before, came across the field, on a heading of southeast, at what appeared to be a first speed and at a lower altitude. I say at a lower altitude because it appeared to be at least twice as big as it was before. The color was the same and still there were no conventional aircraft in the sound. The object continued its flight across the sky until it disappeared and I decided to go to Base Operations and report what I had seen. There was no one at operations to handle the report so I advised a small investigation on my own to see if what I had seen could be explained. I called Kelly Air Force Base Operations and asked if they had any traffic in the air. He said that they had a couple of conventional type aircraft in the local area, and I then called Flight Service in Austin and made a report of the sighting, and requested if they had any jet aircraft in the vicinity of San Antonio and he said that there was some jet traffic in the vicinity of Waco but none in the San Antonio area. I then called Kelly for a verification of what he had told me before and he stated that they had contacted one of their local aircraft and that he had seen nothing unusual and that it was perfect flying weather. I called the Base Officer of the Day and was instructed to make a formal report in the morning.

I first saw the object at 0002 27 February and when I got home at 0100, I decided to call Randolph Air Force Base and see if they had any information that might help with an explanation. Randolph Operations stated that they had not had any aircraft activity during this period.

STATEMENT

On the night of 27 February 1953 I saw an unidentified object in the sky. The object seemed to be extremely high with a steady large light on it. When first I saw this object it was coming from the south-west and seemed to be moving at a tremendous speed. It would go along for a couple of seconds and then seem to shoot to the left and then to the right. In one minute it had gone so far that I had lost sight of it. Then it would return and come back from the northeast going toward south-southwest. It seemed to have a red plane to it. But the most amazing thing was the steady large light and the height and speed it traveled.

STATEMENT

It was about 2340 on the 27th of February 1953 when my way to work I spotted a single bright light moving at a high rate of speed. At first I thought it to be a star or beacon, but it did not move fast enough or at random like a shooting star. I then appraised it in the south-west and was traveling north and made a definite pattern of flight as it circled the moon. At short intervals a mate to the object could be seen a short ways behind it. They continued to circle the moon in a large oval with the longer parts of the oval to the north and south. Visibility was perfect and at no time did clouds obstruct the view. There was only one light and one object and it appeared to be very bright yet very far away. The night was too clear and I am not capable of stating altitude although my estimate of speed was close to 700 miles per hour as compared to the jet aircraft I have seen. The object flew in a quivering sort of way as it wiggled back and forth in flight. There was no sound and the last I saw was when they were heading south in the direction where they were first sighted.

STATEMENT

The following took place on the night of 26 February 1953. As I came to work at about 20 minutes to midnight, I, along with about twenty or so others, observed a traveling light in the sky. In appearance it looked about like a star moving at excessive speed. The night was very clear but I could see nothing but the light. As I could hear no noise and could see nothing but the light, I would presume the object to be at an extreme height. It must have taken about eight minutes for it to go from the south-east to the north, turn and return to the southwest. There is not much I know about it. To me it was just a traveling light, that if it had been standing still, I would have taken for another star.

STATEMENT

On the 27 February 1953 I saw an unidentified object in the sky. The object looked to me like another star but was traveling at a terrific rate of speed. It came from the southeast. It traveled across the sky in a south-easterly direction. Then it turned and came back across the sky furthest straight south. That was the last that I saw of it. There was no sound.

STATEMENT

On the night of 26 February 1953, upon leaving the communications center, I saw a bright light in the sky. It appeared to be quite high in the in the sky and traveling at a high rate of speed. This speed I have not seen before as only a light was visible, therefore, I could not even guess at the altitude. One factor that makes me believe that it was very high was the absence of any sound, more could be heard. When I first saw the light it was moving very fast, to north in a long sweeping arc. It then disappeared and when it reappeared it was heading south. Approximately 45 minutes to one hour later I was returning from a night chow and saw it again in the sky. It appeared to be in the vicinity of Kelly Air Force Base. It was heading west at the time and then turned south. It seemed to fade to a dull red color, and at times if was very bright. The last time I saw it, it was heading south-west away from the vicinity of Kelly Air Force Base.
