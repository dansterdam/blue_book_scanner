5. On 21 May 1952, Mrs. [redacted] Main Street, [redacted] was interviewed in reference to an unusual aerial phenomena she had seen near Gonzales, Texas, approximately in October 1951.

Mrs. [redacted] stated she did not know if the object was of a solid material or not. She further stated that if she had been alone and with only her person to have seen it she would have considered it a figment of her imagination, but since her husband also saw it and after they had discussed what they saw, they decided it was a "flying neuver".

Mr. might relate. Mr. advised that he had known Mr. all his life and that he believed was of good character and trustworthy, however, he had some doubt about the credibility of information received from Mr. He stated that he would not go to great him whenever they met, which was quite frequently. Mr. would great him as if they had not seen each other in a month, when in fact it may have been over a day or two since they had spoken to each other. Mr. further advised that he did not know just how to express what he meant, but that SHULER was peculiar in a way and might exaggerate the truth or supplement it through his imagination.

Mrs. further stated that she did not wish to imply that anyone of the three (3) persons would make up a complete falsehood or that they were not basically honest, truthful, dependable, and reliable.
