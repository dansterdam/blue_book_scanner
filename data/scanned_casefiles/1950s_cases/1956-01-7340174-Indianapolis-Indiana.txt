CODE:

I left St. Louis Lambert Field at dusk January 5 with my passenger, [Redacted] our St. Louis salesman. We climbed VPR to 5000 and flew air ways using Omni Range stations. Air speed about 180 MPH. At about Terre Haute, Ton (an Air Force man) said: "Do you believe in flying saucers?"

I passed it off and didn't even look. At about Clayton marker 10 miles or so west of Indianapolis, he said: "There it is again." This time I saw a very bright intermittent light that at first appeared to be just off my right wing tip and at my altitude. First reaction was that another aircraft was passing us very close and that this was one of his white belly lights. Second and closer observation showed light some distance away - maybe 3, maybe 10 miles. Nothing to judge by - no horizon. Best guess on distance was somewhat south and west of Indianapolis Weir Cook Airport. I called Indianapolis radio and asked what it was and light went off. While CAA was calling Tower air liner over Chicago called me and said: "Glad you asked what that light was. I'm over Chicago and I saw it flashing and it just went off." Chicago is about 185 miles from this point. I figure that the object was in the air because, if it were on the ground, the pilot in Chicago would have had to be at 24,000 feet altitude to see it.


- page 10 -

For brightness comparison - at Indianapolis someone was opening a gas station or super market or something and had several of those portable strong beam producing lights. In contrast, they were candles in brightness.

Another point I had not thought of - after the light went out or disappeared, I did not see any aircraft position lights. Suggestion: If this is Army photographic equipment, similar high intensity lighting sure would help on airports on low visibility approaches on dark foggy nights.

Troy, Ohio

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

The unidentified flying object which you sighted 5 January 1956 was probably a star or planet. Specifically, the second brightest star in our known sky was probably the object to which you referred. This conclusion is based on a discussion with the direction you reported for the object, and just below the horizon.

Jelf St Louis Lambert Field at dusk Jan 5. with my passenger. We climbed VFR & 5000 and flew solemn man. Dorm Novy state air ways rising. I was about Terre Haute. I can st about 150 MPH. I was flying) said "Do you believe in flying saucers?" I said "I off and didn't even look. 14 about Clayton, made 10 miles or so west of Indianapolis be said. "Here I is again this time I saw a very bright & be put off my light that I first off ahead & my altitude. First my 3rd wing tip and my altitude. Reaction was that another air craft was passing us very close, that this was one of his while belly lights. Second & close observation showed lights some distance - maybe 3 maybe 10 miles. Nothing & ridge line - no horizon. But guess on distance.

was over what south and west of Ind'lis
went took airport. I called Mugles radio &
asked what I was light went by. the while
CAA was calling I was air line over Chicago
called me and said "what was that light
that light was. I'm over Chicago and I saw
it flashing and it just went off." Chicago
about 135 miles from this point. I figure
that the object was in the air became, if
were on the ground, the pilot in Chicago
would have had to be at 24,000 ft altitude
to see it.

For brightness comparison - at
Indianapolis some one was observing
a gas station or some thirty or some thing
a bad reveal of those portable strong beam
producing lights. In contrast they were
candles in brightness. -

Another point I had not thought of -
after the light went out, or disappeared I did
not see any aircraft position lights.

Suggestion: - if this is army
photographer equipment similar high intensity
visibility arc would help on low points or low
visibility approaches on dark foggy nights

My dear Colonel Evans:

My face is red! The day before that meeting I got out my log book. The year changed in the middle of the page. At the top of the page, the dates were 1955 and in the middle I began 1956. Consequently, my report to you verbally was erroneous and the report I made to the Center some years ago in 1956 and the sighting was on the night of January 5 that year instead of the previous year.

Try again and see what you come up with.

Very truly yours,

Dear Mr.

We understand our files in vain for the report of the two
sightings which you reported to this command on 31 January 1955. Unfortunately
you did not provide the type of report which would have enabled us to evaluate
your sighting. We are now writing to their being reported to some
other activity which might have additional information.

If you will complete the attached questionnaire and return it
to AFCIN will enable us to determine the probable cause of the
sighting.

This appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric data recording sheet with multiple columns and rows for tracking various measurements. The document includes sections for:

- Pressure
- Temperature
- Significant Levels

Most of the handwritten entries are difficult to read clearly due to the image quality. The bottom of the document shows temperature scales from -30° to 10°C and distance measurements from 13 km to 5 km.

At the bottom right, there is a stock number: "A. F. STOCK NO. 3500-701-936-015"

Dear Mr.

Regarding the unidentified object we saw returning from St. Louis to Troy.

The flight was made on January 5, 1956. I first noticed the flashing lights while we were just north of New Paris, Indiana. It flashed with a brilliant white light about ten times in a brief - ten seconds time. It was approximately south - east of New Paris. The next time I saw it we were over the north of Indianapolis. The lights were south - west to a little north of Indianapolis.
