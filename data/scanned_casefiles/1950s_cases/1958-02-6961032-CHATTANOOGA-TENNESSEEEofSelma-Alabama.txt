Text from the document:

"Mrs. T______ was standing in her yard when she observed what she thought was an airplane coming from the southeast. She watched it approach and she said to her husband who was standing nearby, "Look at that airplane." However, as it came closer, she realized that it was not an airplane but was a strange object flying very rapidly. The object disappeared.

The object moved through the air like a streak. It was erratic and its movements were jerky. The object was larger than the rest and altogether covered a good part of the sky.

It didn't seem too high in the air and was moving very fast. It appeared to go up then down when it disappeared. The time that it was visible was around 12 seconds.

She turned to call her husband and by the time she looked around again it was gone - leaving no trace.

The sun was just coming up and the visibility was very good."

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

I would like to report an unidentified object, seen by a friend of mine at 6:30 a.m., 23 February 1958.

The object was brilliant and incandescent. The shape was like an elongated tear drop. The front part was a blissful green and violet glow, like a neon tube. The tail was like a smoky yellow and white. It moved in a 60° to 70° arc northeast to southwest. It was impossible for me to determine the height, but my guess is that it was definitely very high.

The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a scanned page from a document or report. The image shows a detailed written description of an observed unidentified flying object (UFO).

The output of the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the text in the document is as follows:

Unidentified flying object observed by witness on February 6, 1958 at Chattanooga, Tennessee.

"She was leaning against kitchen window looking out at a bush outside when she heard a noise like the scraping of a bird in distress. She looked and saw what she at first thought was a cloud coming up rapidly. It then realized it was not a cloud but an object traveling rapidly, round, metallic gray in color. 

Then she noticed that it increased in size and was closer as it descended to about 500 feet off the ground. The object then levelled off and was hovering. It was round, metallic gray in color, perfectly silent and motionless. She watched it for about 3 minutes.

The tail was iridescent and the center was light, but a darker color than the sky. The center was emitting a glow and there appeared to be portholes or markings on the surface. She did not see any rivets or seams on the object.

The object left no trail and seemed to disappear directly upwards."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE OF INFORMATION: 15 May 1958
LOCATION: CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE 
EVALUATION: 
DISTRIBUTION: COPY NO. 

SUMMARY:
At 2200 hours on 29 March 1958, a "round, luminous, orange-colored" object was observed in the sky over Selma, Alabama, by a witness. The object was approximately the size of a dime held at arm's length and appeared to be about 500 to 1,000 feet in altitude. It moved in a generally westward direction at a rapid speed, with a "gliding" motion, and climbed slightly during the observation. No sound was heard. After approximately 10 to 15 seconds, the object disappeared from view.
No rational or logical explanation was found for the sighting. The witness was considered to be a reliable observer. No further information or investigation is planned.
