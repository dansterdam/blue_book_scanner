Unidentified Flying Object as witnessed by:
[Redacted name]
Selma, Alabama

Mrs. [Redacted] was standing in her yard when she heard a funny whistling noise. She glanced up and saw a strange object. The sound was not very loud and seemed to fade then return before the object disappeared.

The object moved through the air like a streak. It was mostly bright yellow with the front part a distinct blue. The blue portion was larger than the rest and altogether covered a good part of the sky.

It didn't seem too high in the air and was moving from left to right. It appeared to go up then do then straighten again. It seemed to be going up and away when it disappeared. Two things that lasted was about 15 seconds.

She turned to call her husband and by the time she looked around again it was gone - leaving no trace.

The sun was just coming up and the visibility was very poor.

Commanding Services Officer, Craig AFB, Ala

I would like to report an unidentified object seen from an upstairs window in my home, Selma, Alabama at 6:30 a.m., 21 February 1958.

The object was brilliant and incandescent. Its shape was like elongated tear drop. The front part was a blue green and violet glowing like a neon tube. The tail was like a comet, yellow and white. It moved in a 60° to 70° arc from Northwest to Southeast.

Length of time visible was approximately 3-1/2 to 4 seconds.

It was impossible for me to determine the height, but my guess is that it was definitely very high.

Unidentified Flying Object as Observed by [redacted]
Selma, Alabama

[Redacted] was leaning against kitchen window looking at a bush outside when she heard a noise like the screech of a bird in distress. The noise was not like anything she had heard before.

Then she noticed what she thought was a cloud forming (moving from one side to the other) until it started to move to the right. She watched it momentarily, then looked out another window for something else and when she looked back it was gone.

The tell was iridescent and the center was light blue, but darker than the sky. The center was solid, no white and blue. She did not see the right portion good enough to describe it.

The object left no trail and seemed definitely to be going away.
