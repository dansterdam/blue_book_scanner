Radi-a-silver obj which appeared to be motionless in the western sky. In size it was close to the diameter of the sun; however, not well defined. At a 15° angle, after about 3 min, a thin white trail, about 4 times length of obj was noticed leading away fm obj in a parallel line. Obj suddenly began to move & disappeared into the clouds, climbing. Unlike vapor trail it was thin and fluffy. Went N, then NE, got BX. Obj lost but appeared fm clouds. Disappeared back into clouds.

11. COMMENTS
Obj possessed all the characteristics of an a/c w/the exception of the initial observation of being motionless. Obj was probably moving toward the witness or away fm her & gave the impression of being stationary. Contrails then seen & Fluffy. Evidence indicates that this was an a/c sighting.

Dear Gentlemen:

I am not sure as to what department handles it. I presume therefore it is my wish that you please defer this report to whom it may concern.

In the evening of July 6, 1959 at twilight I noticed a reddish after object which appeared to be motionless in the western sky. In size, it was close to the diameter of the sun. However it was not round but distinctly oblong much like a fountain pen. As I watched, the object I noticed after the passing of about 3 minutes that a thin white trail/about four times the length of the object was leading away from the object.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

in a peculiar line. This white substrate pose
entirely unlike any jet paper trait of space off-
served. It is so hard to explain the diff-
erent but it was probably different. If
only thing it was, possibly thin and seem-
ed to have a fluffy appearance.

It was shortly after I noticed the trail
that it began to move. If was close to
some wide clouds and therefore I could judge
its movement which was steady and rapid.
I was sure that I would lose sight of it I
ran into the house and found by gazing
of 7N 50 geography. Through these I failed
to find the object again for about a half
a minute then it emerged from part of
the center clouds and was probably delet-
ing its speed. It then passed into some
huge clouds and then after being barely
able to detect its yellowish glow through
the clouds it entirely disappeared into the clouds.

When I first sighted it was not hori-
zontal but at about forty five figure angle.
It retained this angle with it. It began to move
and appeared to be heading in my toward
space and farther away off from the Earth.

Very cordially yours
