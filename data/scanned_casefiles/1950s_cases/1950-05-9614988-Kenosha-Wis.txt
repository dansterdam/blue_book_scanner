May. 17     1950 - in the date this was sighted

Sighted at 10,000 to 15,000 ft. a brightly shriving
light at moved in a direct arc from north to south.
I live in Kenosha, Wis. on the 40°-31' lat and 88°
15' long. It was sighted simultaneously by a friend
and I. The weather - slightly cloudy (very slight) with
a 3 to 4 mi. per HOUR. wind coming from the north
east. 9 corners. This light stopped on the southern
horizon and then started again in a south
easterly direction. There was no sound or
any flashes or exhaust gases. Looking at it
continually for five to ten minutes, there
wasn't only one form behind it. time 9:30 PM
                                 sighters. Our age is 13.

P.S. What was it. Please don't use my
name as I am curious to know of
this strange phenomena and I am not
inclined to publicity. Please do not reply.
