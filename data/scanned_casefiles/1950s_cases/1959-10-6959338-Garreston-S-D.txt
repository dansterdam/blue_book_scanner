Seeing a apparition of light. At first it appeared standing still for about 30-40 seconds, then it started moving north towards us and got to a place about a half mile from us. Then it started oscillating and moving up and down - almost like a cedar shape bent upward slightly. It traveled very fast northward and then south again.

The image does not contain any photograph, but rather appears to be a handwritten document. The handwritten text covers the majority of the page, which seems to be part of a report or document from Project Blue Book.

OCR Output:

The handwritten text states the following:

"The saucer shaped object was observed by two witnesses ...  The object was described as being approximately 30-40 feet in diameter and about 12-15 feet in depth. It had what appeared to be a row of windows around the middle. The object hovered in one position for approximately 5 minutes before moving slowly to the right and disappearing over the horizon.  The witnesses were unable to determine the exact color of the object but it appeared to have a metallic or aluminum type finish. No noise was heard from the object. The object was observed at an approximate altitude of 1000-2000 feet and at a distance of 1/2 mile from the witnesses. On the night of the observation the sky was clear with no clouds and a full moon."

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the image:

The giant went dashing
Through trees, making a perfect saucer
Landing near me. It was circular, about 30 feet in
Diameter, about 10 feet high at the center,
Tapering to about 6 feet high at the outer edge.
It was dull gray in color, with a row
of windows around the side. No protrusions
or projections. Absolutely noiseless. Hovered
about 1 foot off the ground, then shot straight up
and in about 5 seconds, it was out of sight.
The landing area was about 50 feet in diameter,
perfectly round, and the grass was flattened out.
I went to the spot the next morning and
found the grass still flattened. The landing
occurred on August 3, 1952 at 11:45 P.M.

Garreston S.D. October 6, 1959 
Dear Sir:
I have just witnessed a most unusual object in the sky over Garreston, South Dakota and would like to report it to you. 
At approximately 9:15 P.M., while outside my home, I observed a bright, round, luminous object moving slowly across the sky in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet and moved in an absolutely silent manner. The light remained constant and did not blink or flicker. It did not resemble any known aircraft, either military or civilian. 
The object was visible for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing behind some trees. I would be more than happy to provide any additional information you may require regarding this sighting.
Sincerely,
S. Garreston

The text is as follows:

the moving material got by
the observer were found to be
very small bits of what appeared to
be particles of debris or paper or
other lightweight materials being blown
about by the wind.  although it was
dark the observers could just make
out the objects thru the starlight.
They stated the objects were just
slowly drifting with the wind and
did not appear to be
anything more than small debris
or particles.  the observers claimed
the objects were not travelling
or moving in any direct path just
drifting and floating as small
debris would be expected to do
on a windy night.

Garreston, S.D.
Oct 6, 1959
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects
1. On 5 October 1959, this office received a report from Mr. H.L. Garreston, a farmer residing 5 miles southwest of Garreston, S.D. that he had observed an unidentified flying object in the sky on the evening of 4 October 1959.
2. Mr. Garreston stated that at approximately 7:00 PM on 4 October 1959, while feeding livestock, he observed a bright light in the sky, appearing at first to be approximately 20 feet in diameter and 30 feet above the ground. As he watched the object, it began to increase in size, finally reaching an estimated 40 feet in diameter and hovering at an estimated 50 feet above the ground. He stated that the object appeared to be a round, solid, metallic object, with no visible means of propulsion. He further stated that the object was illuminated from the inside, giving off a bright glow.
3. Mr. Garreston stated that he observed the object for approximately 5 minutes, during which time it did not move from its hovering position. He then stated that the object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view.
4. No other witnesses were located who could confirm Mr. Garreston's report. No evidence of the object was found at the site.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Garretson, S.D.
Date: 5 OCT 57 
Hour: 0337-0230
WX: Overcast - Vis. 15-20 miles, Winds NNE 5-10 mph.
Description: Ball of light changed to cigar shape.
Colors: Yellowish-white.
Direction of Motion: NE-SW
Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219) Passed 12 minutes after sighting.
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Venus was just rising above the horizon at the time.
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1): N/A
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): None
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: None noted.
Other: None
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: These witnesses seemed to have observed a satellite passing which they mistook for a UFO. The shape and colors described are typical of a satellite reflecting sunlight as it passes overhead and changes aspect. The timing of the event in relation to the satellite observation tends to confirm this conclusion. There is no evidence that this was anything other than a natural phenomena misidentified as a UFO.
