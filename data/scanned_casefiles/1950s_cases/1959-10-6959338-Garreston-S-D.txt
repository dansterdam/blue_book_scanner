Here is the text from the document:

Seeing a apparition of
light - after falling
it for around 7 miles I
stopped my car and got out
we all watched it then
soar higher changing almost
to a clear shape send
just like that it was gone
we headed back to the
highway and north toward
Julgret - My wife spoke
to tell it was again and
sure enough light in the
clouds was a light I
parked the car and we
watched it come out and
go back into the cloud
again - this ended
our experience and
we returned home -

My statement is
we should be told I
my children are 12½
12½ - 7- and 3½ years
of age they are
in a fire.

I think we should be told

Country - they were scared
at what they seen - 6 mo
ago - I just terrified -
I believe our Government
owes us an explanation -
as a Father off 4 fine kids
I ask for one - I believe
what I seen was electrical
motivation in movement upon
light waves - a motivation that
needed close generating energy
from the earth - tell me what
cracked or what have you
but what is this, in
our nuclear age. I haven't we
a right to I know?

The text on this page is handwritten and partially illegible. While I can see that it is a handwritten document with cursive script, I cannot confidently transcribe most of the text due to the image quality and handwriting style. Some words and phrases are discernible, but a complete and accurate transcription is not possible from this image.


- page 10 -

The image contains a handwritten document with cursive script. However, due to the image quality and the cursive nature of the writing, much of the text is difficult to read with complete certainty. Some words and phrases are partially legible, but a full transcription would require a clearer image or expert handwriting analysis. The text appears to be written on a white or off-white page with a dark border or edge visible on the left side of the image.

The text on this page is handwritten and partially illegible. While I can see that it is a handwritten document with cursive writing, I cannot confidently transcribe most of the text due to the image quality and handwriting style. There is a section at the bottom of the page that appears to have been blacked out or redacted with a dark marking.


- page 13 -

The image appears to contain handwritten text, but much of it is difficult to read clearly. The text is written in cursive script on what seems to be an old document page. While I can see lines of writing, the specific words are largely illegible due to the handwriting style and the quality of the scanned document. Some words and phrases might be discernible, but I cannot confidently transcribe the full text without risking inaccuracy.


- page 14 -

The text on this page appears to be handwritten and partially illegible. While I can see there is continuous handwritten text in cursive script, I cannot confidently transcribe most of the words due to the handwriting's complexity and the image's quality. Some words and phrases are discernible, but a complete and accurate transcription would require a clearer image or expert handwriting analysis.


- page 15 -

The image contains handwritten text that is partially legible. While I can make out some words and phrases, the full text is difficult to read completely due to the cursive handwriting and image quality. The text appears to be a document or report written in cursive script on a white or off-white background. Some words are discernible, but a complete transcription would require careful examination and potentially additional context.

The top of the page contains partially legible handwritten text, but most of the text is obscured by black redaction marks. The only clearly visible word at the bottom of the page is "77 times."

about 100 feet above ground
gliding pretty along was
a I what? Itself your
guess is good as mine but
I'll try. It was a mass
of light with a tube light
like structure around the
ends.

By this time I had
my wife stop the car
and I crawled gently under
the wheel knowing this was
a man's job. Our excitement
had washed our children
and for 7 miles I followed
the flying vehicle of light
by man delined
was to try to catch up
with it side by side.
Our littlest daughter
was crying. Daley please
don't get near. Tut
my wife was saying
you know wire don't

I think we should be told.

At 20 min to 4 o'clock Monday morning my family of 4 children and turtle were in our car. The car was moving. My wife was driving, and our location was about 1 1/2 mi east of Garretsons So Dak - I was seated next to my wife and to all concerned half asleep.

We were out at this hour because of a hasty decision and trip to see my mother in Nebr. We were on our way home -

My wife's voice brought me out of my half wake half sleep conditioned - that light there - I answered just a farm light - my neck names for my wife she spoke sharply looks at it - its moving

It did not take me long to come to? for there

It five about the edge
of the side of a garage
let cast not reflecting light
and had me scared stiff.

I still made up my
mind to drive right ahead, but
lost courage at about
70 ft from it.

I then stopped my
car and stepped out with
a prayer on my heart
for Lord help from the good
tube like struct and shot
up from the top of the
most of light and a
streak of blue green went
down the tube length
following this a tube
like structure shot
down from the bottom and

the first tube however
they did not meet
in the middle.

hands full with its very
dangerous road to drive out
careless one.

I was glad this was
happening for which gladness
I will explain later. My
boy said daddy it's just like
turn on a planet with a
ring around it - I said honey
speaking to my wife - Do you notice
that I were following as you
see now dears - My statements
were made at this moment to
hers for a reason because
6 month ago in the state
of Nebraska I does coming
from a lonely road one state
when I ran smack into one
hanging above the road about
20 ft from the ground - 
It was a mass body of
light - suspended or hovering
above the ground, and I
pulsating like the function
of the heart -

I think we should be told!

at that moment the thing
disappeared leaving me quite
bewildered and very well at
heart. I drove up to the
spot in the road + got out of
my car and gazed above
me + nothing but nothing could
I see. Incident left me - sick at
heart - I could not explain
it and my wife felt if I perhaps
should not report it - For fear
public reaction would not be
satisfactory. However I know
that what ever the eye and
mind see - leaves an implant
not what we imagine -

I knew I had seen what
I will
now here we were
6 months later and almost
the same event was taking
place just this time I who
was not alone + little kids
were with my and am
adult - they too were -
