CONFIDENTIAL SECURITY INFORMATION

102 CSI 21-13

1. This investigation initiated by the Director, Office of Special Investigations, San Francisco, California, and dated 23 April 1952, concerning the sighting of a bright metallic object over Vallejo, California.

2. On 25 July 1952, at about 4:00 p.m., a resident, address unknown, telephoned the USAF Radar Station, Travis AFB, California, and reported that he had observed an object flying at a terrific rate of speed passing directly over the station. He described the object as being circular in shape, of a bright metallic color, and giving off no exhaust or trail. He estimated the diameter of the object to be about 30 feet and stated that it was traveling at a very high altitude.

This object was also observed by two other civilians who were standing nearby at the time. The sighting lasted only about 10 seconds. The station was alerted and placed on full alert, but no further sightings were made.

The report of this sighting was forwarded to the Director, Office of Special Investigations, San Francisco, California. The speed of the object was estimated to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. No aircraft were known to be in the area at the time of the sighting. The object was observed during daylight hours under clear weather conditions. This object would appear to be in the category of an unidentified flying object. The speed and characteristics of the object were such that it could not be identified as any known type of aircraft.
