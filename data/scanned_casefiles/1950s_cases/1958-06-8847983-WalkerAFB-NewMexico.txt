10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Circular, pale gold obj, size of dime at arms length. Two objs in trail formation, traveling very high & very fast. Faded in the East, did not appear to fall. First obst at 40-50 degrees elev in West. Flight straight at estimated alt of 10,000 to 10 degrees elev in East.

11. COMMENTS
Pale gold objs obsvd at night. -- Distance & time not consistent w/a/c or other conventional objs if observers alt estimate is considered more correct. Exceptionally slow meteors at alt might take this long; however, the remainder of the spot is not in accord w/this analysis. Insufficient data for final evaluation.
