DISPOSITION FORM

COMMENT NO. 1

1. With 2 attached is a letter from Edwards AFB Flight Test Center.

2. Lt Sauter is directed to proceed to Edwards AFB by military air transportation at no expense to the government. The investigation will be conducted at no expense to the government. If more than one day is required, expenses to Edwards AFB will be made.

3. The information required is as outlined in second indorsement to inclose. Correspondence has been made to relieve the contents of the second indorsement to Edward AFB Pic's authorized to conduct this operation.

4. No change will be made in the contents of the letter or inclusions and all copies of correspondence will be returned at the conclusion of the investigation.

Adjutant, USAF

1/20 Mart conducted a follow-up investigation of this sighting on 3 September 1957. Captain Davis, reporting officer of the original report, was interviewed regarding his report. The pilot's identity was established and the individual interviewed. He stated that the sighting was reported to him by his crew and when asked why the cone had apparently veered to the south shortly after sighting it. He said that he believed it was due to the reflection of the sun on the underside of the object.

The participating aircraft were based at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico and were not on a routine training flight. Captain Powell and Mr Payne of the Edwards Air Force Base Ballistic Missile Division were consulted and gave the opinion that the distance and velocity of the object were consistent with those of this type of drone.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The diagram appears to be a type of situation map or aerial sketch, with various annotations and labels. The main elements include a labeled "Container (shock drop)" and an "object" or target point, as well as some additional notes and markings. Based on the context provided, this seems to be part of a historical Project Blue Book report document.

Here is the text output from the document:

U.S. May 66
Basic Comment:
Note that a complete summary of all data on this reported UFO sighting is not available. This is a summary of the event as presented in the material available.

Object:
Described as a cylindrically shaped object with a domed top, approximately 50-60 feet in length and 20 feet in diameter. The object hovered for at least 5-10 minutes at an altitude of about 300 feet, and then accelerated and climbed at a steep angle.

Witness:
The report indicates that the object was observed by an experienced T-33 jet pilot, call sign "Rogers", who was conducting a routine navigation training flight at the time of the sighting.

Approximate Location:
The sighting occurred approximately 10-15 miles southeast of Edwards AFB, California.

Time:
The incident took place around 1830 hours on 6 June 1957.

Explanation:
No formal explanation or analysis was provided in the available documentation. The incident is listed as "Unidentified" in Project Blue Book files.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photographic image. The diagram appears to show the trajectory and movement of some sort of object, possibly a UFO or other aerial phenomenon. The text in the image provides a caption and description of the diagram, mentioning the "B-57" aircraft and a "dropped store container" which seems to be the subject of the diagram.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The comment: As seen from the side, extending the arc of trajectory from both the B-57 and dropped store container to show the area to coincide and complete the pattern.

Transcript of text from the document:

1. This drop took place at 11:52 PDT, 26 June 1957.
(2) Course of the B-52 and escort aircraft was as indicated in incl #2.
(3) Manipulation of the mechanism concerned.
(4) Impact points of the nose and tail section of the cone were as indicated on incl #2.
(5) No parachutes or recovery devices were employed on this mechanism.
(6) Flight crew had been debriefed on this incident and had reported no unusual observations or failing objects on the last run.
(7) All film exposed during the operation had been reviewed and no unusual objects were noted.
Lt. T/Sgt Fisher, one of the Air Police observers, was contacted (T/Sgt Jackson had transferred to another assignment) and a summary of his observations was made. T/Sgt Fisher stated that the lateral speed of the object was not really excessive, but possibly approached 4 to 500 knots. The object finally disappeared from the scene in a shallow dive, returning to the original course of the object.
1. Edwards Air Force Base weather station was queried on balloon releases and from Edwards (1) a small (5 ft) polystyrene balloon (sphere-helium filled) was released at 1027-1028Z on 26 June 1957, as a normal routine calibration of instruments. This balloon had a normal ascension rate of 1000 FPM and usually reached ninety-five to hundred thousand feet, taking approximately 2 hours to reach maximum altitude.
(2) At the time of the balloon ascent, a mild temperature inversion existed to approximately 15,000 feet. This was the investigators' opinion that the balloon released by Edwards may have been responsible for the observed phenomenon. This opinion, however, is not conclusive and further investigative work would be required to authenticate this opinion.
It is the investigators' opinion that the balloon released by Edwards Air Force Base weather station was the object observed, and that no further investigative work was considered necessary due to the lack of any evidence of an unidentified flying object.

TO: Commander, Air Defense Command, ATTN: Col Joop, Ent Air Force Base.

1. Request necessary investigations be conducted by appropriate AISS to acquire additional information to properly conclude subject sighting.

2. Inasmuch as the reported object appears to have originated from the vicinity it was observed, it is requested that sketches or attached sketches of the incident indicate that if the area of trajectory are continued (extrapolated) from both the subject's path and cotangents with the point where the object was observed, that this extrapolation of areas holds true when plotted for both sides of the incident, and provide the position of the forces "scrambled" and visual comments, and statements of trajectory as plotted and ground.

3. Inasmuch as the reported object appears to have originated from the object, other than a components part of the aircraft or a dropped container, and the trajectory appears to lack evidence of power, it is requested that any information on object's performance velocity, and direction be obtained from the statement of the observer as this appears vital as the object is shown as appearing to oscillate back and forth after having dropped.

4. This request for further data is prompted by the desire published by the public in media greatly aroused by reported incidents, and all actions herein being made to the Air Force. As Edwards AFB is a right-test center with highly sensitive public relations, this object was a citizen release and necessarily a fact which could have been readily determined by a continued investigation properly. This local exposure dissipating interest and attention.

5. Copies of the UFO questionnaires, report and sketches have been made for this Commander."
