There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from an Air Intelligence Information Report as part of Project Blue Book, which was the United States Air Force's systematic study of unidentified flying objects.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
COUNTRY: United States
REPORT NO.: GH - 892 - W
DATE: 12 Aug 1952
PLACE: Red Bluff, California
SUBJECT: Aerial Phenomena Observed at Red Bluff, California
SUMMARY: Several unidentified luminous objects were observed in the sky over Red Bluff, California on 1 August 1952. The objects were observed by numerous reliable witnesses and exhibited characteristics which could not be readily explained. The sighting is considered to be of substantial intelligence value.
DETAILS: On 1 August 1952, at approximately 2300 hours, Pacific Daylight Time, the Air Force Control Tower Operator at the Red Bluff, California Municipal Airport observed an unusual aerial phenomenon. The object observed was described as a brilliantly lighted, round or disc-shaped object, showing no lights such as running or navigation lights normally associated with aircraft. The object appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 20,000 feet. The object was observed on several occasions during the night, on each occasion performing maneuvers which could not be readily explained. Among the witnesses were the Commanding Officer of the Air Force Detachment stationed at Red Bluff, other Air Force personnel, police officers, and numerous other reliable civilian observers.
