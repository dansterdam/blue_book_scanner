Dear Captain Gregory,

Enclosed herewith are three photographs and five negatives obtained by the writer. These photographs were taken by two reliable citizens of Cincinnati, Ohio, which may be of interest to your command. This photograph shows a bright light object which appeared to be hovering over the local city power plant. The photographer stated that the object remained stationary for several minutes and then suddenly disappeared. The photographer is present, interested in astronomy, particularly lunar studies. He is in possession of this photograph (which I have marked #3) with partial ovoid light censor. He stated that he has taken several other photographs of similar objects on previous occasions, and that he knows of several other people in this area who have obtained similar photographs. However, a thorough investigation of the above-mentioned reports should be made.

Mr. Harrell told the writer that he photographed the "object" while taking a series of shots of the moon. He has many times photographed the moon, and I feel certain that the photograph in question was taken at that time and refers to an object of interest in the moon, and I feel certain that the photograph in question was taken at that time and refers to an object of interest in the moon, and I feel certain that the photograph in question was taken at that time and refers to an object of interest in the moon. He also gave me permission to contact your command regarding the photographs or, if you prefer, I will send whatever additional information you may desire.

The photographs taken by Mr. Harrell were taken on Sunday, October 14, 1956. This was during the night-time sightings of UFO's from three separate groups of witnesses in the greater Cincinnati area. Names are as follows:

Fort Covington, Kentucky about 9 p.m. - Mrs. Cloyd told the sky was deep blue, while descending an invisible light about quarter the size of the full moon. The object was stationary, according to her statement, by the time she had reached the front door of her residence and observed the phenomenon for several minutes.

Text extracted from the document:

Mr. and Mrs. R--, Batavia, Ohio. Having first learned of the sighting from an announcement in the advertising department at the T--y--d Store, they say an unusual sight in the sky on Sunday, Oct. 14, 1956 at about 6:30 P.M. while traveling east on U.S. highway 52 between Batavia and Felicity, Ohio. They were about 7 miles from Batavia when they first noticed the object in the sky. It was a bright, metallic-looking object which appeared to be trailing a tail or tongue of flame behind it. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and was visible for about 3 seconds. It then made a sharp turn and disappeared out of sight.

When the object turned, it did not leave a trail, and it was not made of sharp turns, but a smooth, continuous turn.

The whole thing appeared to turn or rotate at one time. A jet would have had a curve, but this did not. They say they did not take their eyes off it until it was out of sight.

Mr. and Mrs. R--, (and wife) Pike, Ft. Thomas, Ky. Object sighter in Ft. Thomas at about 7:30 P.M. the same evening Oct. 14, 1956. Said object appeared the same as described by Mr. and Mrs. R--, except that it appeared to be stationary for about a minute, then shot away at a terrific speed. He said the object appeared to be stationary for about a minute.

These, in brief, are the descriptions of the UFO's seen by three separate groups on October 14, plus the photographs. I hope they may prove to be of value to you.

I might of the international crisis, I hope that I may be able to serve your purpose. Mr. C-- in Washington in regard to the matter discussed by phone on November 6, 1956. I believe it highly advisable that you consider this confidential, and I might try by letter, however, hoping that clarification might be obtainable.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

P.S. Please return the enclosed photographs and negatives to the writer after analysis as they are my responsibility.
