TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

This is a report concerning an unidentified aerial phenomenon which occurred on 6 January 1953 in the vicinity of Austin, Texas. The report indicates that a witness observed a luminous object moving rapidly through the sky, which was estimated to be approximately 500 to 700 miles per hour in speed. The object was described as being approximately 25 to 50 feet in diameter and having a bluish-white color. The report states that the object was observed for several minutes before disappearing. The investigator notes that the witness was a reliable observer and that they had no explanation for the phenomenon observed. The report concludes with a discussion of the physical characteristics and speed of the observed object, as well as the reliability of the witness.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing reports of meteors or unidentified flying objects in the Mediterranean Sea.

METEORS
The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying meteors. All reports regarding their observations of meteors, particularly their appearance and disappearance as accurate as possible, either by bearing and distance or radiant and path, are desired.

MEDITERRANEAN SEA
Third Officer T. Vatis, of the Italian SS. Monrese, Capt. E. Ranieri, Master, reports that at 0235 G.M.T., January 15, 1953, in lat. 34° 49' N., long. 15° 49' E., he observed a brilliant light similar in appearance to a star, which descended vertically and disappeared at an altitude of 105°. 

Chief Officer D. F. Gottschallt of the Israeli SS. Nair Diensdorf, Capt. G. Goldstein, Master, reports that at 0230 G.M.T. on March 12, 1952, while his ship was proceeding in lat. 32° 06' N., long. 29° 58' E., a lookout sighted an object silver in color of about second magnitude and approximately twice the diameter of a star. It appeared at about 30° altitude bearing 220° and moved at a very rapid rate in the direction of 110° for about 3 seconds until it disappeared. Its heading was northwest.
