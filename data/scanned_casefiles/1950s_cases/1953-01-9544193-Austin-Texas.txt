INCIDENT FORM (317)

This is [redacted] and I live at [redacted] Park Place, Austin, Texas. By occupation is part time school patrolman. I hold "observation of the object" in area 15 min on sharp at 3 p.m. - saw object 15 to 20 inches in diameter, about the same size as two full moons and the color was silvery, or rather to have out a silvery reflection. Witness moves was very close, say 150 to 200 yards or less, or estimate. The speed seemed to be about 500 and 750 miles per hour. There was no sound, and there was no maneuvering, and it was point in a straight line. It was directly over the horizon. The time of sighting was approximately 15:10 at my capacity, the 15th day of January 1953. The observation was visual.

As observer at this object was at Harris, Texas and Hampton Hill in northeast section and to the time I observed the object, I was traveling hills to a point of first road intersection - very near [illegible] in heavy tree area (somewhat obscured) when I looked up, to (the airplane) raised on point nearly east I observed the silvery object which appeared to be very high, and a noted the similar path. The object was very high, very smooth, very light, almost to a white. They were very excited over it. I watched the object almost constantly until it disappeared, which was probably some 4 minutes. As near as I can judge, this object was very high, this clear, for past several years I have been a very close observer of aircraft in flight, and I don't think there is a possibility of my being mistaken in the impression of this object. Of course, as no mark is actually in, I wouldn't care to venture a guess but there are no rings on it, no broken lines, and I really believe that it was some kind of a disc or aerial object.

Not as a ball, however. Amazingly as my son was a Navy pilot and instructor for some years during World War II and I also have a son-in-law who was a Navy pilot instructor at Altus AFB, I always had a very unusual interest in aircraft. I couldn't estimate the height because I do not know the size of the object but this the object was on or twelve or thirteen thousand feet altitude. I know a cloud was very high. The clouds were thickly scattered all over the sky, and the sky was largely blue. The visibility was practically unlimited yesterday morning. I was on an open school yard where there were very few trees and no houses at all. It was an open school yard where visibility in that direction was unlimited. I was facing almost the south, and then southwest. Prevailing winds were no object. To explain, a cloud observed it - it did not pass over me - was, I'd say, about a 60 angle above the horizon flying away from me.

METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying meteors. MI r/s is reporting their observations of these bodies, as greatly assisting in their work. It is desired to have the Greenwich time and point of appearance and disappearance as accurate as possible, either by bearing and altitude, or by relation to fixed stars, or both.

Complete observations on long-enduring trains and their direction of drift are of special importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.

MEDITERRANEAN SEA

Third Officer, T. Vaira, of the Italian SS. Monrosa, Capt.-E. Ranieri, Master, reports that at 0615 G. M. T., January 15, 1953, in lat. 39°50' N., lon. 1°10' E., he observed a meteor with a very long red trail visible for 3 seconds, bearing 35° at an altitude of 45°. The meteor descended vertically and disappeared at an altitude of 10°.

Weather, air temperature 52° F., barometer 30.20 inches.

Chief Officer D. F. Gottschalt of the Israeli SS Meir Dizengoff, Capt. G. Glationi, Master, reports that at 0350 G. M. T., on March 6, 1953, in lat. 39°34' N., lon. 12°24' E., Cadet A. Lubinski on lookout sighted an object silver in color of about second magnitude and approximately twice the diameter of a star. It appeared at about 50° altitude bearing 200° and moved at a very rapid rate in a direction of 110° for about 3 seconds until it was obscured by the foremast. The vessel's heading was 117°.
