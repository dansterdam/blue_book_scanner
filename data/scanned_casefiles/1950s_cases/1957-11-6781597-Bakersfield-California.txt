Observer stated he saw an object
the size of a basketball 10 miles away.
By computation, it is found that actual
size of the object would be 26,900 feet in
diameter, or approx. 5 miles. This is
impossible.

A check shows no other reports
received from this general area, which
would certainly be the case.

Therefore, the source is considered
[redacted]

Other.
