The object is described as a "Cigar-shaped, white with red and green lights, alternating colors, orbiting, indefinite shape".

Not for I hour!

06/22452 NOV RJVPJB
Conditions indicated the crew were on object
And able to discern it to minute accuracy.
Any comparatioin, it is found retractionable
The object would be 2 6, 000' at an almost 90 degree
Velocity or 900 mph. Seemingly this
Is impossible.

A check shows no other reports
received from this general area which
would certainly be the case.

The thing, the source is considered
more.
