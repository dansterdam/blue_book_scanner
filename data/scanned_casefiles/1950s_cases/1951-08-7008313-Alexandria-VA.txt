REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT SIGHTED BY [REDACTED] AND WIFE

Alexandria, Virginia    19 August 1951

Time: 1805 EDT

Wind: Surface SSW/12; 1000 190/13; 5000 220/15; 10,000 310/15 (Anacostia WAS 1600 EST)

Description of Object Sighted: A "frosty" silvery football-shaped object with its longitudinal axis parallel to the ground. Off-hand estimate of size at time of sighting 50 feet along longitudinal axis and 20 feet vertical axis.

Shape: Elliptical, or football, shaped. Shape did not change.

Position When First Sighted: Time 1805—appeared to be about 2 miles southeast of Masonic Memorial in Alexandria and about 3-4 miles from observer.

Apparent Altitude: 2000 to 4000 feet. Steady.

Elevation: 5-7° decreasing slightly as object appeared to move into distance.

Course: Away from, and to the right of observer, estimated 155° true.

Position When Last Sighted: Time 1807—estimated 10 to 12 miles further away based on approximate visibility of 20 miles. Lost sight of object when turned off of King Street to go up Masonic Memorial hill for a better look. Arrived in clear area on top of hill at 1807:plus 45 seconds, but unable to sight object again.

Unusual Characteristics: Unusual in that the object did not change its reflection as it moved through sun's light. No tail, no surface protuberances, no vapor trail. No smoke or other sign of propulsion. No apparent noise.

Summary: This object appeared to be progressing along a controlled flight path at a constant altitude. Its angular decrease in elevation is believed to be due to its disappearing into the distance toward the horizon since its size appeared to decrease at the same time. It did not behave like a balloon. It did not look like any form of aircraft known to the observer.

CSAF ITEM 7 /RESTRICTED/

FROM AFOIN-4/TC

FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND ACTION.

AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED NEAR ALEXANDRIA VIRGINIA, AT 1805 EDT, 19 AUG 51, BY _____, USN, AND HIS WIFE. THIS OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS A "FROSTY SILVERY" OVAL-SHAPED OBJECT OF APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN LENGTH TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED AT 2,000-4,000 FEET.

LT. _____ REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO THE COMMAND POST AT THE PENTAGON.

IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT THE OBSERVATION WAS A REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS FROM AN AIRCRAFT FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF 6,000 FEET TO 15,000 FEET AND A SPEED OF 150 MILES PER HOUR TO 425 MILES PER HOUR, DEPENDING UPON THE DISTANCE THE OBJECT FROM THE OBSERVER.

THE REPORTED "APPARENT ALTITUDE OF 2,000 FEET-4,000 FEET" IS JUDGED TO BE INCORRECT, CONSIDERING THE OTHER OBSERVATIONS MADE BY LT. _____. THIS INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED BY LT COL M.D. WILLIS, AFOIN-4/TC.
