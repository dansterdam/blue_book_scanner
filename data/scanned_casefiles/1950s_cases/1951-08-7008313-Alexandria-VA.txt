There is also a handwritten note that states "Based on latest observation from auto air plane locations as original sight observation".

REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT SIGHTED BY LT. ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA - 19 AUGUST 1951
Time: 1805 EDT
Wind: Surface 53M/12; 1000 190/13; 5000 220/15; 10,000 310/15 (ANACOSTIA VAS 1600 EST)
Description of Object Sighted: A "frosty" silvery football-shaped object with its longitudinal axis parallel to the ground, of estimated size at time of sighting 50 feet along longitudinal axis and 20 feet vertical axis. 
Shape: Elliptical, or football, shaped. Shape did not change.
Position When First Sighted: Time 1807--appeared to be about 2 miles southeast of Masonic Memorial in Alexandria and about 3-4 miles from observer.
Apparent Altitude: 2000 to 3000 feet. Steady.
Elevation: 5-7° decreasing slightly as object appeared to move into distance.
Course: Away from, and to the right of observer, estimated 1559 true.
Position When Last Sighted: Time 1807--estimated 10 to 12 miles further away. Object had turned off King Street to go up Masonic Memorial hill for a better look--arrived in clear view on top of hill. Unable to sight object again.
Unusual Characteristics: Unusual in that the object did not change its reflection as it moved through the sunlight. No trails or other disturbances. No vapor trail. No smoke or other sign of propulsion. No apparent noise.
Summary: This object appeared to be progressing along a controlled flight path at a constant altitude. Its angular decrease in elevation is believed to be due to its distance from the observer which increased at the same time. It did not behave like a balloon. It did not look like any form of aircraft known to the observer.

CSAF ITEM 7 /RESTRICTED/ 
FROM AFOIN-V-TC
FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND ACTION.

AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED 
NEAR ALEXANDRIA VIRGINIA, AT 1805 EDT, 15 
AUG 51, BY LT COL M.D. WILLIS, USN, AND
HIS WIFE. THIS OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS A 
"FROSTY SILVERY" OVAL-SHAPED 
OBJECT OF APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN LENGTH 
TRAVELLING AT HIGH SPEED AT 2,000 - 4,000 FEET. 
LT COL WILLIS REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO THE COMMAND 
POST AT THE PENTAGON.

IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT THE OBSERVATION WAS A
REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS FROM AN AIRCRAFT
FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF 6,000 FEET TO 15,000 
FEET AND A SPEED OF 150 MILES PER HOUR TO 
425 MILES PER HOUR, DEPENDING UPON THE
DISTANCE THE OBJECT FROM THE OBSERVER.

THE REPORTED "APPARENT ALTITUDE OF 2,000 FEET - 
4,000 FEET" IS JUDGED TO BE INCORRECT, 
CONSIDERING THE OTHER OBSERVATIONS MADE BY
LT COL M.D. WILLIS. THIS INTERVIEW WAS
CONDUCTED BY LT COL M.D. WILLIS. AFOIN-V/TC.
