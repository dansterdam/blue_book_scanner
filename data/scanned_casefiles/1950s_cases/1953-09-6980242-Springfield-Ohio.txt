The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document titled "Meteors in the Records" that discusses reports of meteor sightings and fireball observations collected by the American Meteorites Society.

The text in the document is as follows:

The American Meteorites Society, whose members specialize in the study of meteorites and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such phenomena. From a large enough number of good descriptions of a meteor, astronomers can analyze the data mathematically and determine the meteor's radiant—the point in the heavens from which it seems to come. The meteors and fireballs described were published in Meteorites, the journal of the society, and thus made available for future research.

The records of the society for the years 1930 to 1935 list dozens of fireballs, many of which were somehow overlooked by saucer enthusiasts. On August 11, 1930, during the maximum of the Perseid shower, a blue-green fireball (AAMS 2132) apparently oval- or cigar-shaped, appeared over Washington, Oregon, and Idaho at 7:30 P.M. and was observed by more than 100 witnesses. So brilliant was it that it showed a noticeable disk, it flew in a horizontal path, slightly broke up trail, and disappeared at 15.p.s.

Another fireball, sighted in the evening of August 27, 1930, over a six-state area — Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa — at 9:25 p.m. was observed by hundreds of people and was reported by plane crews flying over a six-state area. 

Similar fireballs that vanished without trace were reported on September 25, 1953 (AAMS 2331), October 4, 1954 (AAMS 2337).

The image contains three sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" to indicate how high an object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and a second curved line labeled "B" to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer last saw it.

The second and third sketches show landscapes from the observer's perspective, with an object in the sky in the second sketch.

Acting as an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

"32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch."
