DATE 28 Sept 53

On the night of 26 September, there after driving some 15 miles come first near this "flying saucer". 15 yds come first near the moon. If he called out can lift was directly over the moon. The effort, altitude to 30°, and we all saw it or this time. The object, one minute, it was visible, through the light of the football field. It moved to be transparent (like the cloud), and in a swirling position, or it moved northward. It was one large swirling except when you could see it was 8 that out the direct light of the football field. After about 2½ more minutes, it was now larger visible. It had moved out of the "complete" 8 the width. Will in the same general shape as when it was first observed. I have wanted to see something in the sky that I could not identify for some time. I do not believe that I saw anything that is a danger to anyone, or anything that I know of.

Meteors in the Records                                                28 September 1953
Meteor Observation

The American Meteoritics Society, whose members specialize in the study of meteors and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such phenomena. From a large enough number of good descriptions of a given meteor, astronomers can analyze the data mathematically and determine the meteor's radiant—the point in the heavens from which it seems to come. The meteor is then identified by its radiant and given an AMS number. The data were published in Meteoritics, the journal of the society, and thus made available for future research.

The records of the society for the years 1950 to 1955 list dozens of fireballs, many of them green, that were somehow overlooked by saucer enthusiasts. On August 11, 1950, during the maximum of the Perseid shower, a blue-green fireball (AMS 2236) apparently ovaled or cigar-shaped, appeared over Washington, Oregon, and Idaho at 7:30 P.M. and was reported by more than 100 witnesses. So brilliant that it showed a noticeable disk, it flew in a horizontal path, silently broke into three pieces, and disappeared [9, p. 273].

September 30, the same year, was a big day for meteors. At 1:55 A.M. a giant fireball (AMS 2236) roared over southeastern Illinois from north to south, leaving a luminous train visible in five states and illuminating the sky and countryside from St. Louis to Louisville and from Memphis to Knoxville. The final detonation, heard over a western Kentucky area 1000 miles square and shock buildings from Paducah to Memphis. Fragments showed from a twenty-five mile area, struck five buildings, and penetrated one roof. About fifty pounds of meteorites dropped in Murray, Calloway County, Kentucky, and are now in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. That same night about 10:45 P.M.

Fireballs were reported by plane crews flying over a six-state area—Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico [9, p. 115]. Similar fireballs that vanished without trace were reported on September 28, 1953 (AMS 2331); October 4, 1953 (AMS 2330); May 15, 1954; and October 27, 1954 (AMS 2337).
