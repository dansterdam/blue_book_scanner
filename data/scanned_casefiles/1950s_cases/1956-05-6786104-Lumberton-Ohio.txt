MAY 25, 1956

OHIO, FRIDAY, MA

No Saucer, But—
Sure Was Lit Up!
Alarmed residents of the
Xenia area just night flooded
Wright-Patterson Air Force base
with calls about flying saucers
in the area.

According to the reports, the
saucer was being hotly pursued
by an F-86 fighter from the
58th Fighter-Interceptor squadron which eventually overtook
the interloper.

The facts aren't quite so fascinating, but some Xenia residents
may take consolation from the
fact one WFAPO pilot who with
his wife saw the pursuit also
telephoned the base last moment.

An RF-84-F jet aircraft using
a bright light for night photography rapidly caught all the excitement. It was taking pictures over
Xenia as it will be doing over
other areas near Dayton for the
next several nights.

The F-86 was real and from
the 58th.

MONDAY, MAY 28, 1956 M-29

Not Martians, King-Size Bulbs
If you see bright lights moving through the skies between now and June 15, don't start looking for Martians.

Chances are the lights are caused by an earth-type RF-SAF jet plane on a photography mission for the Wright Air Development center's aerial reconnaissance laboratory.

The flights will be made nightly in the southern Ohio, Kentucky and western Pennsylvania area. The light is from high intensity mercury lamps mounted on the plane and used, like photoflood...

IT'S A PLANE, EXPERTS SAY OF "SAUCER"
MIDDLETOWN, May 28 -- It wasn't a flying saucer. So say experts at the Wright Air Development center at Dayton, about a "saucer" seen Middletownians saw in the sky here last Monday night.

The bluish object was an RF-SAF test plane, experimental with night aerial photography, WADC spokesmen said. The plane, carrying two wing pods with many high-intensity mercury arc lamps, probably would continue through mid-June.

Handwritten note at bottom of page:
This was reported to ATIC as a fleet object that swooped low and suddenly gone out with a pulsed-like cloud - white ray, reportedly moving as ... death ray, paralysis ray - disintegrating ray - anti-gravity ray, etc.

NAME: [redacted]
SIGNATURE: [redacted]
DATE: 25 May 56

At 9:12 o'clock, EST, on 23 May 56, I was walking in the driveway of my home when I noticed a light too bright to be aircraft lights (unless it was a landing light).

The light seemed to be travelling at a medium fast speed and no noise was discernable.
The light disappeared behind trees and reappeared in approximately five minutes and traced a course back disappearing behind trees to my left.

Object appeared from my left and disappeared on right, reappeared on left two and one half times. (traveled from left to right 3 times, from right to left two times)

The appearance of a searchlight was noted at several different times. The rest of the time the light seemed to be a steady bluish white light with a star-like brilliance.

If my estimation of altitude of 5,000 feet is correct, then the light was travelling at approximately 75 MPH.
