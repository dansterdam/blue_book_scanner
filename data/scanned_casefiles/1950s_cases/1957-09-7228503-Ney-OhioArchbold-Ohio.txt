Subject: Declared Vision of Flying Saucer

Dear Sir:

On Thursday, September 5th, 1957 at approximately 2:30 P.M. one of our citizens, Mrs. [redacted] of Archbold, Ohio reported to me that she viewed a Flying Saucer in the northeast section of this area and Mrs. [redacted] of Archbold also verified the same and also viewed this Flying Saucer in the same direction.

They declare it was a bright object of oval shape diminish like the reflection of a mirror, wavering in the air at first. Then it moved in a vertical direction and then horizontal direction after a bright red light flashed on the upper part of the object as it traveled up.

At first it was thought it was an aircraft in trouble but after the flash of the red light, the object began traveling at a rapid rate of speed and way toward the southeast.

Ney, Ohio is about 15 miles south of Archbold where the other party also viewed the same saucer.

At first I discounted the idea and questioned Mrs. [redacted] because she mistaken and that possibly it was aircraft on it resembled a object other than aircraft, but she insisted that it was not aircraft as did the other party.

This information is reported to you for what it is worth and we would appreciate your report of finding and if anybody else viewed this so-called Flying Saucer.
