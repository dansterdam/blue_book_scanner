Sept. 6th 1961

Dear President Kennedy:

In November 1951 I saw for a full 3 minutes a strange space ship directly overhead. I think I have the knowhow of how it worked and I am sending it on to you in the hope it might help us with our space program.

The ship looked about 400 feet long about 60 feet high at the center. Its outsides were covered with metal plates which were alternately made hot and cold.

My concept of the operation of the ship is:
That the outside metal plates were made of electrically separated positive proton particles and when the outside revolving ring at the very center of the space craft was revolved at very high speed the ship would climb upwards when the ring slowed down the ship would descend.

The ship was creating electrical opposition to the positive atomic attraction force of the earths attraction. The center revolving ring had metal plates spaced about every two feet which brushed the outside metal plates of the ship.

I noticed that the faster the ring spun the lighter the whole outside of the ship lighted up.

This is the most amazing part. To move the ship forward it seemed as though pulses of negative electricity were charged into the tail section and because the revolving ring at the center was the most positive the electricity flowed rapidly from the tail to the center of ship.

Since gravity can pull only on a negative charge what was happening was that gravity was made to pull horizontally from tail to center of ship and this is what made the ship move forward. When they wanted to bring the ship to a stop or make it fly backwards the electricity was pulsed in at the nose of ship and of course it was attracted backwards to the revolving ring at the center forcing the ship backwards.

Now it seems to me that such a ship would be very hot inside and there might be danger of radio-active contamination to the occupants. So I would suggest that if we will work on it it would be made to lift a second ship with rocket controls for outer space flight.

This type of craft should be useful for the Armed Services since it can fly higher and travel faster and can maneuver much better than our conventional aircraft.

I am enclosing a rough sketch of how the ship looked which I saw and I hope I have not interfered too much with your very big job which you now have.

I do hope that all of the international problems will somehow resolve themselves.

By very best Regards,
Sincerely yours,

21 September 1951

Dear Mr.

Your letter of September 6th addressed to the White House has been referred to this office.

Your interest in this matter manifested by writing to tell us of your experience is appreciated. Your description of how you think the object was propelled is not complete enough. Electronic theory supports a part of your approach to a propulsion system utilizing magnetic lines of force, i.e. if an object can be moved hypothetically on a given line of force, perhaps some degrees to that line, it should move perpendicular to the line and very fast at the speed of light. The problem is, of course, how do you identify and isolate the line of force. There are other interfering factors with no other interference, rotate the body to the right-angle then orient the field around the field?

The sighting you report as having occurred almost ten years ago sounds interesting. Were you only other message to the sighting? Were you able to obtain any photographs of the object? I would appreciate hearing from you on this.

Thank you for taking the time to write.

Sincerely,

Here is the text from the document:

Major W. T. Coleman:
Dear Sir:

There probably were other witnesses to the sighting of the strange object but I never asked anyone whether or not they had seen it. There were a lot of people around here at Venice and Inglewood flying in Los Angeles where I live. The reason I'm sure I saw it is because I was walking by. Do. He saw it too and he stood up on his chair and looked quite a lot at it.

I realized while I was watching that I would have been anything, I owned if I only could have had my motion picture camera along.

I have a very vivid memory of what the ship looked like. Perhaps sometime in the future I can paint a picture of it to show to you.

Its course in the vicinity of an object lying on known lines of force and then being rotated 90 degrees to the lines of force to cause it to move perpendicular to these lines is not the system which was used it seems to me.

I think the operators of the ship had developed a system whereby the ship could be made to oppose gravity in varying degrees so it could maintain altitude at definite levels. When this was taken care of its horizontal motion was accomplished in a different manner. It could be that the revolving ring at center of the ship served a dual purpose to keep the metal plates hot and at a set positive potential and also to create a heavy magnetic field around ship.

There might have been another revolving ring which I did not see but which could have been revolving in an opposite direction and if the first ring were suddenly stopped to release the magnetic field then it follows that the ship could have

the second rings field which was an opposing field still connected with the ship and by magnetic opposition the ship could be made to move. It was a very large and big ship but it must be remembered that the ship if it was not attracted by gravity it would have been like a ship away out in outer-space. It could be moved with almost no power at all.

I read an account in the newspapers back in the late forties about an Army Jet pilot who was sent up to investigate a similar ship, I think his name was Capt. Mantel, he radioed back to ground that the ship looked metallic and then he crashed. UFO investigators later found out that his ship on the ground contained some radio-active material.

What I think happened was that Capt. Mantel decided to come in on a curve to get near to the UFO but when he got too close the positive flux of the UFO suddenly also freed his jet plane from gravity and its momentum carried him into the side of the UFO.

I wish the government would set up a research department to find out exactly what causes gravity and try to build aircraft and rockets which would fly gravity free. It would place us far ahead of the Soviet in all forms of Space Technology.

Thanks for writing,
Best wishes

9 October 1951

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Your letter of October 4th concerning your theory of "electromagnetic propulsion" has been read quite thoroughly. When I stated to you the means by which movement could possibly be achieved, I only suggested a possibility filled with many complex problems.

Your theory is too generally stated leaving many questions unanswered. For example, how do you notice "a ring" without a prediction base? Do you actually mean how to use a base for friction in order to get something moving. That causes much a ring to rotate?

The Lintell case you refer to involved an Air Force pilot who, without oxygen equipment, flew too high for too long. In point of view he believes to have been a toy-look balloon. There was no anti-activity connected with this the results of Captain Mantell's entering a P-51. In other words, whether Captain Lintell probably existed as a result of hypoxia.

There are some research projects underway in the realm of electronics dealing with various methods of propulsion, i.e. use of new energy sources available in space.

SIGHTING BY AIRLINE FIRST OFFICER NOVEMBER 2, 1951

"We were flying an American Airliner DC-4 cargo flight from Los Angeles to Tulsa via Dallas, Texas. At 7:15 a.m., at 4500 feet, 3 minutes east of Abilene, on Airway G5, this object passed to our left at our same altitude and approximate course.

The object was very bright green with a short whitish tail or trail of exhaust vapor. We were making a true air speed of 220 mph, and the object appeared to be going several times our speed. After getting several miles out in front of us the object exploded, shooting red balls of fire in several directions like a fourth of July roman candle.

The object appeared to fly in a horizontal attitude, and not in the path of a parabola, as in the usual meteor pattern. It appeared to be as large as a medium to large size airplane."
