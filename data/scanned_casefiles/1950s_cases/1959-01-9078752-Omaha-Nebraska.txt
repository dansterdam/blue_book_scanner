FIRST OBSERVER WAS INTERVIEWED WHILE OBJECT WAS STILL IN VIEW. HIS ORIGINAL AND SUBSEQUENT OBSERVATIONS WERE CHECKED AND 
PAGE FOUR RJUKF1O 4
FOUND REASONABLE ACCURATE.TNOE BEHAVIOUR AND COURSE OF THE OBJECT CORRELATED CLOSELY WITH THE PREDICTED CELESTIAL TRACK OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE STAR CIRCUS. THE TRACK OF THE OBJECT WAS CORRELATED WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE AIR NAVIGATION SECTION OF SAC. BASED ON MY PRIOR OBSERVATIONS OF CIRCUS AS AN ASTRO-OBSERVER I AM CERTAIN THAT THE OBJECT REPORTED WAS THIS STAR.
INITIALLY REPORTED RAPID MOVEMENT CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR DUE TO THE TWO TEMPERATURE INVERSIONS. NORMAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS STAR AND ITS USUAL COURSE WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE OBSERVER WHO AGREED THAT THE OBJECT WAS EVIDENTLY A STAR.
L. NONE
SUM OF REPORT - NO ADDITIONAL REPORT IS ANTICIPATED
