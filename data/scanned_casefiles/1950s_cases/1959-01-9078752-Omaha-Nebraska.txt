PAGE FOUR RJWFKO 4
FOUND REASONABLE ACCURATE.NTHE BEHAVIORAND COURSE OF THE OBJECT CORRELATES CLOSELY WITH THE PREDICTEDNORBITAL TRACK OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE STAR CIRRUS. THE TRACK OF THE OBJECT WAS CORRELATED WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE AIR NAVIGATION SECTION HQ SAC. BASED ON MY PRIOR OBSERVATIONS OF CIRRUS AS AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER I AM CERTAIN THAT THE OBJECT REPORTED WAS THIS STAR. INITIALLY REPORTED RAPID MOVEMENT CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR DUE TO THE TWO TEMPERATURE INVERSIONS. NORMAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS STAR AND ITS USUAL COURSE WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE OBSERVER WHO AGREED THAT THE OBJECT WAS EVIDENTLY A STAR.

L. NONE

END OF REPORT. NO ADDITIONAL REPORT IS ANTICIPATED

Your letter to Congressman [redacted] expressing your opinion that the proposed hearings on the UFO program should not be held was greatly appreciated by us. Your views that the Air Force is approaching this problem scientifically and with an open mind is one of the few helpful attitudes toward this subject.

If we can be of any further assistance in providing you with information for your forthcoming book on the UFO research, death, and identity to call on us.

Sincerely,
