UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT ()
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unusual Object
LOCATION: 17 United States (Spokane, Washington)
DATE-TIME GROUP: 23 January 1952 - 30 January 1952
OBSERVERS: NAMED PERSON -/- ORGANIZATION: SSgt Harry M. Cavanaugh, 2nd Lt. Robert W. Holt
DESCRIPTION OF UNUSUAL OBJECT: At approximately 0500 hours on 23 January 1952, while on routine security patrol, SSgt Harry M. Cavanaugh and 2nd Lt. Robert W. Holt observed an unidentified brilliant object in the sky. According to their statements, the object was brilliantly illuminated, traveling very rapidly from east to west, and at the distance from where they stood it appeared to be slightly larger than the cockpit of a jet aircraft.
The object left a blue trail which was broken. The trail appeared to be coming from the object's exhaust. The height of the object was estimated by a ground light to be approximately 1000 feet on Fairchild Air Force Base. The object was projected vertically in a stationary position, the flying object traveling parallel to the earth.
Sergeant Barnes was behind Sergeant Holt and me and did not see the object.
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: A sighting of the type described is of particular interest to the Wing Intelligence Section, and since the sighting was witnessed by another person, this report appears well-founded.

The text found in the document is as follows:

At approximately 19:30 hours on 20 January 1952 I was walking from my quarters with M/Sgt Auridus C. Holm and S/Sgt Robert T. Barnes. My attention was called by Sergeant Holm to an unidentified object traveling below the clouds at approximately 500 feet.

The object was moving at a terrific rate of speed, to and from estimating that it was several thousand miles per hour. It appeared circular in shape and was brilliantly lighted, the light being distinctly brighter than an orange. The object was approximately 3/4 to 1 mile away, and at the distance from where I stood it appeared to be slightly larger than an orange.

The object left a blue trail which was broken. The trail appeared to be continuous like in a comet.

Height of the clouds was estimated by a beacon light on Fairchild Air Force Base. The beacon was projected vertically in a stationary position, the flying object traveling parallel to the earth.

Sergeant Barnes was behind Sergeant Holm and me and did not see the object.

CONTENTS of Preparing Officer:
Since the NCO making this report is a very reliable individual who holds a responsible position within the Wing Intelligence Section, and since the sighting was witnessed by another person, this report appears well-founded.

At 19:20 hours, 20 January 1952, I was leaving the 92d Bomb Wing Headquarters Squadron barracks with T/Sgt Harry A. Cavagnaro and S/Sgt Robert T. Barnes. As I drew a little to the North and saw what I thought was a shooting star, slightly above the water towers.

I called Sergeant Cavagnaro's attention to it, and he remarked "That's no shooting star, sir." As I continued to look, I knew the object could not be a shooting star, for it was traveling at a high rate of speed and appeared to change in size several times. 

The object was below the clouds, which I estimated at a height of 200 feet, moving silently from North to South. It was oval shaped and appeared to pulsate as it left a sharp blue intermittent flame at approximately six foot intervals.

The color of the object was a bright blue-white and appeared to be the size of a grapefruit from a distance of approximately 2000 feet.

Sergeant Barnes did not see the object, for it was visible for only about two seconds.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Since the NO major this report is a very reliable individual who holds a responsible position within the Wing Intelligence Section, and since the sighting was witnessed by another person, this report appears well-founded.

APPENDIX II
Fairchild AFB, Washington - 20 January 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:
At about 1430 PST on 20 January 1952, two Wing Intelligence airmen noticed a bright spherical object traveling through the sky. At first it was apparent to be a meteor but then it was noticed that it was traveling beneath a cloud layer. The object was traveling at a speed much faster than a jet aircraft. The object, which made no sound, was traveling in a path horizontal to the earth at an estimated 500 feet and left a blue trail. The trail seemed to dissipate after 5 to 6 seconds.

The two airmen observers, a Tech Sergeant and Master Sergeant are considered reliable observers.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION:
This incident is interesting due to the fact that there was an eight-tenths cloud coverage at 4,700 ft. It is possible that the object was viewed between the clouds and that it was extremely high, indicating that the sighting was a meteor. However, the sources indicated that they believed the object was definitely man-made and below the cloud cover, but it was traveling at an extremely high speed, possibly faster than the speed of sound. The possibility of the object being a conventional aircraft is excluded, since no sound was heard. The tremendous speed of the object, however, was such that information for questioning this analysis was not available.

III. CONCLUSIONS:
If the object was beneath the cloud cover it was not a conventional aircraft or meteor, and no conclusions can be made as to its identity.

1. Reference is made to AF Form 112, Report No. 93 F-5463, dated 23 January 1953, subject: "Sighting of Unidentified Objects".

Further investigation has revealed the following additional information:

a. Azimuth angle (from true north) at point of initial sighting and points object disappeared.

b. Silence in seconds object required to traverse above mentioned course.

c. Elevation angle at point of initial sighting and point at which object disappeared.

d. How object disappeared, i.e. the method of disappearance, whether it was as small such as an aircraft disappearing in the distance or did it just blink out.

e. Measured calling and detailed description of sight coverage, such as all directions covered.

f. Relative size of the objects in diameter such as 5 times larger than a diameter of a 5 cent piece.

g. It is doubtful that due to the lapse of time the observer's observations can be corroborated. It is understood that no other observers are available.
