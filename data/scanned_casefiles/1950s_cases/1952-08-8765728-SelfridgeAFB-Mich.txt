25 August 1952

About 2240 hours, on the evening of 14 August 1952, I and a friend, A/2C _______ were standing by Barracks 7-347 facing the lake. I noticed a light that was a solid, very bright light. I called the attention who verified the object. It was as bright as the North Star and it was a solid, clearly visible light. I watched it for several minutes. At first it passed for several seconds and then headed on a northwest course. This lasted approximately one hour. All this took about two (2) minutes. No than waited and watched in the same direction in an anticipation of another one. Another proceeded at approximately only hours following the same angle as the first. It was from the direction of the lake and continued east, however, this one was more faint and continue east. It passed two (2) times for one (1) and five (5) minutes, respectively. When it passed the second time, we called A/2C _______ who was also watching approximately 2230 hours.

After calling A/2C ________; and I reported the incident to the staff duty officer of 19 TSCB AF. His case back with us to see the object. However, by that time (2300), it had faded from view. The staff duty officer stayed until approximately 2310 and then returned to his office. I left approximately 2330.

At the time of the sighting, the sky was very clear. The object made no sound, and when it passed for the five (5) minutes, it resembled a bright star. I had one (1) bottle of beer approximately 2030.

15 August 1952

On the night of 14 August 1952, at approximately 2240 hours, A/2C and I were standing behind barracks 217, near the east wall. A/2C was talking when suddenly noticed a bright object moving in a general direction of the radar Station.

It seemed to come from the southwest direction. While in a fairly reasonable low altitude and then started climbing over the direction of the Jet bar. While on this course, it had maneuvered horizontally but still sharply, on the same course. It then obtained a pretty good height over the Jet bar, hesitated a few seconds, and dropped earthward over the Jet bar until it disappeared from view.

We watched while longer and at 2245 hours another bright object of the same nature appeared. Following the very same course, came from the same direction, zig-zagging also, only this time it did not drop, but kept climbing. At a tremendous height, and some 20 miles among the stars and stopped, obviously motionless for about one (1) or two (2) minutes. Just past the Jet bar. It then started moving again with the same motions as before, very bright, distinctive from any star. It stopped at twelve (12) o'clock, straight up, and became motionless among the stars at which time I called over three (3) other airmen.

One was A/2C [illegible]. The other two (2) were unknown to me. Two (2) of us watched it for about one (1) minute, during which time at remained motionless. It was then that [illegible] and I went to get the Staff Duty Officer.

The three of us then returned about 2300 hours and A/2C was still watching, i.e. only by that time it had moved from its position to five (5) o'clock where we lost track of it. The Staff Duty Officer left, telling us to come over and make a report in the morning.

He had been gone about five (5) minutes when we heard a roar like a quick warming and came out immediately. The F-94 had its Afterburner going, and it climbed straight up at a pretty high altitude and followed the same course as the object had taken. He circled twice and then landed. I don't know if the Staff Duty Officer notified them or not.

The reasons I don't think this was a star or any type aircraft are:

1. It acted like it had a mind of its own, zig-zagging and suspending itself in mid-air for a period of time.

2. When it moved at such a great height as the stars, it moved with unbelievable speed, far more than any known aircraft. It was impossible to even estimate it's rate of speed.


- page 3 -

3. It had a rather in order color at times, more at the
crystal white. Like the north star, only such brighter and sometimes
clearer.

4. It had no sound or any visible trail.

A/C [redacted] left the scene at about 2315 hours. A/C [redacted] and
I sat these moments discussing so an hour ago but now no more.

I had not been drinking that night.

15 August 1952

At 2255 hours, 14 August 1952, I had just finished work and was on my way to my barracks when an A/3c and N/3c called to observe a moving object in the sky.

They were standing, facing towards the lake, between buildings 917 and 916. At about a twelve o'clock position, I immediately picked up the moving object which somewhat possibly a star and to the eye it seemed to be about two and a half times as large as a star, brighter than the average star and east of a light or lavender color. About half a minute after I first saw this object, it came to a complete stop and was motionless for about a minute. It then started moving again, leaving no trail, in a zig-zag manner but at the same time moving from the twelve o'clock position to about a two o'clock position. There was 14 cases of a complete stop and just seemed to hang, among the stars for almost a minute.

At this time, or just before, the two (2) airmen who called my attention to this object went to notify the night Duty Officer. Then he arrived at the scene, the object had moved in a north-eastern direction to a north five o'clock direction. I was about 50 yards away and could see it quite well. Shortly after the arrival of the Duty Officer, the object disappeared completely.

This object travelled from a twelve o'clock position (where I first observed it) to a five o'clock position in a period of five or six minutes, during the movement of this object, I saw it pass between two and a star for just a few seconds. The star was completely blocked from view.

There was no sound coming from this moving object and I feel sure that it was not a plane of any kind because of the zig-zag movements and its erratic completely and just remaining motionless.

This statement is true and as I had just finished work for the night I had not been drinking. Because of the altitude this object seemed to be at and the distance it travelled, I am certain that it was travelling many times faster than our jet aircraft can go.

1. AT 150955B, AIRMAN SECOND CLASS [REDACTED] and AIRMAN SECOND CLASS [REDACTED] were standing at the east side of Selfridge Air Force Base, near Lake St. Clair, when they observed a lavender colored light, approximately the site of the North Star, appear west of their position approximately twenty (20) degrees above the horizon and travel in a northeasterly direction. The light seemed to ascend as it travelled this course and it-tang from lost to right. The light then proceeded the light was a great distance from their position but since it appeared to be at a great altitude, an estimate could not be made of the distance.

2. AT [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] stated that two light traveled to a position which appeared to be over the "Joe" AFB located on Highway ~29, at the northeastern end of Selfridge AFB, in less than two (2) minutes and hung motionless in the sky for a few seconds. The light then faded and then appeared beyond the horizon. There was no trail or sound and since the object appeared to be at a high altitude, neither observer could estimate its speed. The light was observed for two (2) minutes.

3. Both observers continued to watch the sky and at 150355, another light of lavender color, approximately twenty (20) degrees above the horizon, appeared from the west, approximately twenty (20) degrees above the horizon. It was a very brilliant, lavender color of the light was in direct contrast with the stars. It was continued on course parallel to its path until it reached a position ninety (90) degrees above the horizon where it stopped again.

4. AT 150355B, AIRMAN [REDACTED] and AIRMAN [REDACTED] sighted AIRMAN FIRST CLASS [REDACTED] and two (2) other airmen. They watched the motionless light for about one (1) minute.

5. AIRMAN [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] then reported their observations to the STAFF DUTY NCO, CAPT [REDACTED], who returned with them to watch the light which, however, was no longer visible. According to AIRMAN [REDACTED], the light moved to a position of approximately 50 degrees above the horizon in a period of five (5) or six (6) minutes and grew dimmer as it disappeared from sight at 150600.

FOUR AIR FORCE OFFICER OF INTELLIGENCE COMMENTS:

a. AIRMAN [REDACTED] has served twenty-two (22) months on active duty; has no aircraft experience and is considered relatively reliable.

b. AIRMAN [REDACTED] has served thirty-one (31) months on active duty; has no aircraft experience and is considered usually reliable.

c. AIRMAN [REDACTED] has seven (7) years active duty service. He is a senior aircraft maintenance and is considered usually reliable.

at 1900hrs, 8 Aug 52.

4. The 6 lst ACWRON, SELFRIDGE AIR FORCE BASE, MICHIGAN, indicated
no unusual radar observations.

5. Weather and winds at time of sighting:
    a. Ceilings:
        (1) Visibility - 7 miles, clear
        (2) Clouds - negative
