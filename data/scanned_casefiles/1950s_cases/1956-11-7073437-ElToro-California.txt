UFO observed visually and by radar from
night of 11 Nov to morning 12 Nov, though not
simultaneously. Helicopter and a/c directed
to intercept. Nothing observed in UFO area.
Blips, which kept suddenly appearing and disappearing, indicated speeds from 50K to 15,000
MPH (Mach 25.0)

Somehow from another radar activity, which
could confuse even an experienced radar operator. Results of ATIC Analysis outlined

11. COMMENTS
Attempt to relate visual sightings with
radar scope return does not appear
valid. No visual sighting or intercept made of the objects seen on scope.
Both helicopter and aircraft attempted
interception, but although radar would
lead them to UFO vicinity those aircraft observed nothing. This report
is generally typical of anomalous propagation resulting either from an unusual combination of weather and other related conditions or interference.

1. Enclosed is a copy of AF Form 112 with radar scope-photographs of the El Toro MCAS UFOB sighting 12 November 1956.

2. Since evaluation of this sighting depends primarily on an analysis of the radar scope photographs, and since facilities for accurate interpretation of radar photographs are not available at this level, tentative evaluation of this organization will be deferred until your organization can complete a thorough analysis of the photographs.

3. At the present time, it appears that the radar part of this sighting was caused by some type of local phenomena which affected the El Toro MCAS radar sets. The visual phenomenon which may not necessarily have been related to the main radar sightings) seem to have been caused by known phenomena and/or temporarily over-active imagination stimulated by the unusual events of the evening and morning.

I. SOURCE: WILLIAM E. HOED, SGT., USMC
   Address: MCAS EL TORO, CALIFORNIA
   Age: 26
   Length of Service: 5 years
   Duties: GCA and control tower operator
   Education: High School graduate

   Qualifications: Two (2) years radar experience, Three (3) years combined control tower and GCA operations.

II. RELIABILITY: When interviewed source was very cooperative with positive attitude toward the questioning. He appeared to be genuinely interested in clearing an answer to his observations. He gave a very detailed account of everything that had happened. He appeared to be of average intelligence and very knowledgeable of radar and GCA operations. He could offer no explanation as to the identity of the objects he observed and stated that in all his experience with radar, he had never seen any returns similar to these.

In view of SOURCE's sincerity, familiarity with his job and experience he may be considered as reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS AND EVENTS:

1. SOURCE was on duty as standby GCA operator on the evening of 11 November, 1954. At approximately 2130 PST he was standing outside near the GCA unit and noticed a bright light orbiting north of the field (MCAS EL TORO).

2. The object appeared on the screen as a large target, moving approximately and at speeds which SOURCE estimated to be from fifty (50) to over two thousand (2000) knots. (He stated that at one time, one of the objects moved from one side of the screen to the other, a distance of approximately eighteen (18) nautical miles in a period of four (4) seconds). Shortly, this object was joined by a group of smaller objects. At this time they started moving all over the screen in a very haphazard manner, with no apparent destination.

3. On several occasions, the objects moved rapidly, stopped abruptly and then reversed course. On other occasions, the smaller objects appeared to join the larger one, merge with it and form one larger blip. A few seconds later, the small objects would depart and again dash all over the screen leaving the large blip in its original size.

4. Early in the course of these observations, SOURCE switched on another radar set, this set revealed the same objects.

5. Having notified the tower of his observations, SOURCE was...

been visited by the Officer in Charge of the Station Rescue Unit, Captain M.H. 
Schumacher. Captain Schumacher sent a request for a photographer and an order 
to wrap up the helicopter.

6. In the ensuing hours, SOURCE attempted numerous intercepts on the 
objects. By vectoring the helicopter and later (approximately 0450PS) two 
F-86 D's from George AFB in them but met with repeated failures. The helicopter 
and/or jet-fighters would close on the objects but could never make contact.

7. SOURCE stated that one of the objects flew formation with the 
helicopter and both fighters for a short period of time then ran at a very 
high speed.

8. The helicopter and fighters landed and, while refueling was in 
progress, the three pilots entered the GCA unit and personally observed the 
objects. They again took off and attempted further intercepts with negative 
results. A daylight approach, three target were plotted on the radar 
screen and immediately the fighters were vectored in on them. They were identified 
as commercial airliners, two DC-7's and one Constellation. At this point all the 
unidentified objects left. They were last seen while heading in a Northwesterly 
direction. They never reappeared.

9. Photographs were taken of the radar screen at approximately 2330 PST. 
A sequence of six (6) photographs were taken at four (4) second intervals. (See 
Incls. # 6 - 7) 10. A roll of film was taken of the screen however at some time in their handling, the entire roll was exposed and it turned 
out completely blank.

10. The radar sets in use were the US Navy CPN-A, with a transmitter 
frequency of 2800 MC, a 20 KM scan rate and a Hydrogen Thyratron type modulator. 
They employed a device which theoretically shows a return only on moving targets. 
The sets were operated at the ten (10) mile range with majority of the time. The 
antenna tilt ranged from 0° to ten (10) degrees. Height finding radar was not 
employed. The only altitude indication was given when Captain Schumacher, in the 
helicopter, observed a light approaching at approximately 4500 feet. This light 
was identified as one of the unidentified objects by radar.

11. There had been no recent maintenance difficulties with either set. 
SOURCE stated that he was familiar with the effects of signal interference and 
the effects of anomalous propagation had been observed to extend the range of 
the observed targets beyond the range of the ground clutter at this site but that 
during the time of these observations it was not. In comparison to conventional 
aircraft, some of these targets appeared to be larger and faster, others about 
the same size as conventional aircraft but much faster and capable of maneuvers 
completely beyond the capability of modern aircraft. The targets remained the 
same size except in the instances where smaller ones joined the larger one. 
They traveled at varying speeds, disappeared then reappeared in a new location 
several times. SOURCE stated that in his opinion, the targets could not have 
been built per ground return at ten (10) degrees antenna tilt as an the angle 
he was picking up the fighters at 18000 feet when they first approached the 
station.

STATEMENT

At 2130 or shortly after, on 11 November, 1956, a red blinking light appeared down the lower mountain range directly North of WCS HQ row. Myself and Sgt Word viewed the light through field glasses (8X50). The light seemed to set still for short periods of time, 30 seconds or so, then move at a rapid pace.

About 10 minutes after first sighting the object, Sgt Word and myself turned on the radar gear and spotted a target 6 miles North of the station. The target time was about 0230 and lasted about one to five or six minutes. (Note after 0300, I made no more observations). The traffic of the targets North of the station remained about four to eight miles. About 0200 the targets appeared both on the radar screen and our scope, about two miles south, then closing on the station til reaching four miles. This one target spotted which appeared large, had other targets feeding in and out at 12, at which time I named aircraft stationary.

I visually covered the sky from time to time during the entire period while I was up. After the first sighting, I spotted nothing more.

II. RELIABILITY: When interviewed SOURCE was very cooperative and did his utmost to aid the investigators. He answered all questions with thoroughness and preciseness. He was very friendly, though serious. He was very apparently tired as he had been up the entire night and still had not gone to bed when the investigators arrived. He appeared to be of above average intelligence in all phases of the conversation. In view of SOURCE'S sincerity, length of service and rank, he may be considered as reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING AND EVENTS:

1. SOURCE was in station operations MCAS EL TORO at approximately 2135 and was notified by the control tower that GCA was reporting several unidentified objects on the radar screen. SOURCE immediately drove to the GCA unit and observed the objects. He requested a photographer to take scope photos and immediately took off in his helicopter. GCA vectored him in on several of these objects but he sighted nothing. At approximately 2230 PST he observed a flashing red light on a heading of approximately 160 degrees. GCA verified this target and vectored him. However, he was unable to close on it and after a five minute chase the light made a turn to the left and disappeared. SOURCE remained airborne until approximately 2300 at which time, he landed and was debriefed. SOURCE advised Flight Service and ATC of the sighting.

2. SOURCE took off again, attempted more intercepts under the control of GCA and was still unsuccessful. He landed and took off again at Ltr 010. Shortly after becoming airborne, SOURCE noticed a flashing red light which appeared to be on an airway. LA. He did not attempt an intercept on this. At approximately 0230, SOURCE sighted a steady red light approaching him from the North. GCA verified this and told him that it was heading directly towards his aircraft. Just prior to reaching SOURCE'S aircraft, the light went out. SOURCE stated that immediately after this he saw a dark, shapeless object go by him on the right. He could not give any shape nor make out any details of the object. He described it merely as a dark "glob".

3. Shortly after this, two F-86's from George AFB joined in on the search and further intercepts were attempted but to no avail. After landing at El Toro and refueling with a stop in at the GCA unit to observe the targets, the fighter pilots and SOURCE again took off and attempted further

FROM: Flight L-6 4602D ATSS                REPORT NO: IC-UFO-4-56        PAGE SEVEN    7 of 17

STATEMENT

At approximately 2135 on the evening of 11 November, 1956, I received a call from the tower that CCA had notified them that they had several objects on their screen that could not be identified. I drove to the CCA unit and observed the objects myself, called for a photographer, cranked up the chopper and went to investigate. CCA vectored me on to several objects, stated that they were on my wing but (1) could not observe anything.

At about 2230 I did observe a red flashing light on a heading of about 160° CA, warbled my target. The target stayed at about 60 k without increasing or decreasing distance for a period of about five min, he then turned left and with a sudden increase in speed, vanished from sight. I remained airborne until about 2300, then came back and refueled.

(I) contacted Flight Service and ATC. They called back and we took off again. Again there were more radar contacts but I still sighted nothing. I came back and took off around 0130, more radar contacts, then I sighted another flashing red light. It seemed to be about where a plane would be if he were flying AMBER 1 airway. Radar had him, he stopped a ways from the field, was joined by several more blips, then came back, then large one disappeared. At about 0230, I sighted a red light approaching me from the North. CCA called it about the same time, stated one was approaching from the North on a collision course, but he was reaching me, his light went out (this was a steady red light). I then could make out a dark object, dropped my nose and he went by to my right. My first impression was that it was about the size of an L-19, but can hardly say that I could not tell whether or not wings were visible. I reversed my course, but made no more visual contacts. Radar stated that he increased his speed and disappeared again to the North. Very shortly we had on station from George AFB. They also had blips come up on them, but they could observe nothing.

We came along, refueled and went up again. It was now almost dawn and the only blips we saw were proven to be civil aircraft. Radar had no contacts after dawn. We discontinued at 0635 on the morning of 12 Nov 56.

0400 - C-47 # AF 16140 reported at 10,000 feet over Los Angeles.

6. The two fighter pilots involved were contacted and reported that they arrived in the area at approximately 0400 PST and made a visual search and then took vectors from the El Toro Gca operator. After searching for approximately twenty five minutes, they landed at El Toro, refueled and continued the search until daybreak. They reported that they were vectored into the objects several times but never made contact, visually or radar.

Shortly after 0600, they were assigned three targets which they intercepted and identified as two American Airlines DC-7's and a Constellation. At this time they were instructed by the Control Center to return to George AFB. During refueling at El Toro, they went to the GCA trailer and personally observed the objects. The pilots were 1/Lt Frank M. Satterfield and 2/Lt H.J. Dye of the 329th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, George AFB, Calif.

7. Other personnel present at El Toro during this period were questioned and requested to make statements. Variations from negative observations to seeing several groups of lights going in all directions and at varying speeds. See Incls # 2, 3, 4 & 5

8. Photographs of the El Toro GCA screen taken at approximate four (4) second intervals at approximately 1130 PST (2330) were obtained from the photographer Captain Shumaker. See Incls #

9. Allowing the possibility of a malfunctioning radar set, the commanding officer of the GCA detachment was approached and he stated that the set had been completely checked and was found to be in perfect working order and in addition to this, during the period of observation an alternate set was turned on and revealed the same targets.

10. GCA officials at Los Angeles International Airport were contacted and gave the following information:

I believe the blips appearing in the scope were not true targets, but were probably an on about propagation. From the description of the blips as moving rapidly and erratically, disappearing and reappearing, it would appear that the indications were of the type which results from such propagation peculiarities.

This describe explain the lights, of course, but the fact remains that some saw the lights and some did not.

Also the fact that the pursuing aircraft never saw them, or had radar contact with them is an indication that there were no material targets there. Quite possibly the reason the airborne radars did not pick up the blips while the ground station did is the difference in operating frequency of the sets.

Task #2 Statement of tower operator

STATEMENT

Upon arriving at work at 2330, the evening watch informed us that there had been "flying saucers" in the area and that they had seen them. There was a little discussion as to what they looked like - and I tried to locate the man the field glasses. I was unsuccessful.

I left the tower for approximately ten minutes. When I came back (about 1230) GCA and the helicopter were working together in the local area and could be seen very well with the field glasses.

The helicopter and GCA worked all night running intercepts on the blips and were later joined by two F-86's from George AFB who also joined the search. At about 0530-all blips disappeared and the search was conquered.

Although I scanned the sky with the field glasses throughout the night, I was unable to see any of these unknown objects.

STATEMENT

Upon arriving at work at 2330, the evening watch informed us that there had been "flying maneuvers" in the area and that they had seen them. There was a little discussion as to what they looked like etc - and I tried to locate them thru the field glasses. I was unsuccessful.

(about 1220) GCA and the helicopter were working together on 265.8. The chopper was flying in the Deal area and could be seen very well with the field glasses.

The helicopter and GCA worked all night running intercepts on the blips and were later joined by two F-861's from George AFB who also joined the search. At about 0630 all blips disappeared and the search was secured. Although I seemed the sky with the field glasses throughout the night I was unable to see any of these unknown objects.

Incl # 3   Statement of tower operator

STATEMENT

At approximately 2130 on 11 November, 1956, while our crew was on duty, we received a call from GCA. They reported having seen visually, lights in the U.S. sector. I looked through the binoculars but could see nothing at that time. A short while later, approximately 2230, the helicopter next up to investigate. I kept visual contact with the helicopter most of the time he was airborne and at one time saw a red light roughly 1000 feet above his and heading in the direction of Saddleback range. The light appeared to be very bright with a rapid erratic flash. I would judge it's speed at nearly 130-150 knots. Moments later it disappeared. Another time after the helicopter had landed, I sighted a similar light bearing approximately 330° from the tower heading Easterly. It suddenly dropped from an estimated 500 or 600 feet to very near the ground and vanished. I watched these objects for nearly three hours. They appeared to have no definite course or system in maneuvers. The most objects I ever saw at one time was two heading in the same general direction.

Incl # 4 Statement of tower shift supervisor
STATEMENT

The following account is a description of my tour of duty as shift supervisor in the control tower on 12 November, 1956, during the hours of 0100 to 0800.

1. At 2320, 11 Nov., assuming the duty at approximately 2330 the shift supervisor being relieved advised me that Sikorsky helicopters were flying in the near vicinity of the airfield and that the Rescue Helicopter was airborne trying to locate them.

2. A complete scan of the horizon with binoculars revealed no show anything.

3. During this period of duty, El Toro GCA kept the tower informed of all targets on their scope and described several as being as large as R50, some being within air miles of the field at speeds estimated to be from 50 knots to as high as 2200 knots.

4. Visual checks, with and without binoculars, were made throughout the night with extras not reported without success.

5. The weather during this period was very good, visibility was better than ten miles at all times and some haze was noticed around the Laguna Hills at very low altitude.

6. My experience as a tower operator is six years of actual duty. I am 31 years old, have a private pilots license and completed the advanced Air Control School at Olathe, Kansas.

STATEMENT

Around 2120, I noticed Sgt Word and M/Sgt Karnowski looking towards the North at red light, which I never saw. We then turned on the scopes and picked up a clear target about five miles north. It moved very slowly in to about 2 miles north.

That's all I saw. The rest of the morning I was outside observer for Sgt Word.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The preparing officer was unable to arrive at any definite conclusion as to the cause of these sightings. However, since no other radar installations in the area were checked, and no other objects and so few visual observations were made, it seems possible that some local phenomena was affecting the MCAS EL TORO radar installation.

[Signed]
LOUIS C. SAUBER
1/Lt USAF
Officer in Charge

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:

1. In the opinion of the Approving Officer, this sighting was caused by anomalous propagation compounded by external sources, causing an attempt to relate visual sightings to the radar sightings. The following reasons are given for this evaluation:

a. Although one source stated that he was familiar with the effects of anomalous propagation, past experience indicates that this phenomenon is seen in various forms, all of which are not easily identified.

b. There are many radar sites in the area. Anyone of these could have been causing interference, compounding the effects of anomalous propagation, thus making this phenomenon unidentifiable even to trained observers.

c. Although, during vectoring operations, ground radar observed the objects on the wing of the interceptor, neither visual or radar contact was made from the aircraft.

d. It has been noted several times in the history of the UFOB program that observers have noticed a normal phenomenon and then picked up an object on radar. These two objects are not necessarily the same. It will be noted that, at no time, did the observers see visually the fantastic speeds and maneuverability of the objects that were seen on the radar scope.

2. Therefore, an evaluation of "Other: Was Anomalous Propagation" is given to this sighting.

3. The photographs have been sent to ATIC for further analysis.

1. Enclosed is a copy of AF Form 112 with radar scope photographs of the El Toro MCAS UFOB sighting 12 November 1956.

2. Since evaluation of this sighting depends primarily on an analysis of the radar scope photographs, and since facilities for accurate interpretation of radar photographs are not available at this level, tentative evaluation is being deferred until your organization can complete a thorough analysis of the photographs.

3. At the present time, it appears that the radar part of this sighting was caused by some type of local phenomenon which affected the El Toro MCAS radar sets. The visual sightings (which may not necessarily have been related to the main radar sightings) seen to have been caused by some temporarily over-active imaginations stimulated by the unusual events of the evening and morning.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately explained in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Believe this form is like magazine write-up and I'm required to write a report to make my report, it's often stated to report it, and then figured you had me writing without my remarks.

I can add one thing, and I recall to state its true - Everything in this report is true and correct. The machine I saw came from outer space in my opinion. I would not chase one in a Cessna at 190-7. I had it to do at all. Those windows with space if that means anything.

I think I should tell you about the two sightings I had of unusual objects. When I was living near Salisbury, MD The first was Nov. 1956 (election day). When I arrived home just before dark, I noticed two (2) large oblong ships which I thought were dirigibles, they seemed to be near a neighbor's house located on the highway which was about half of a mile away. They were side by side, just a little more the length of a moving very slowly. They seemed to be headed in the direction of our house, so decided to watch them come over, as I thought it unusual to see two so close together. But they suddenly stopped in mid air, then they seemed to keep moving around in such a way, than they looked like parachutes, and wobbled from side to side. Then a sort of dangling ladder was lowered, and it looked like a person was climbing down it. Then they moved a little further away, and looked like one big dark cloud.

I went into the house to make supper, but kept coming out again every few minutes to see if they were still there. The last time I looked it had gotten almost dark, but by this time there were three ships in a perfect line side by side.

About 8:30 P.M. there were two very brilliant lightning flashes, but the sky was perfectly clear. Evidently that is when the ships were taking out. The flashes were seen for several miles around, and lots of reports

were made to the "Salisbury Times". But as far as I know, I was the only one to see the ships. I could never gotten snapshots of them, I still don't know why I didn't.

The second experience was Dec 1956 about 7:30 P.M. I went out into the back yard, and was looking at the stars, when I noticed one (which I thought was a star) that was so much brighter than the others, and almost over our yard. It appeared to look lower than a star and pulsating. I kept looking at it and was wondering for a minute, when it lit up like an electric light bulb. Very bright first, then changed to orange, then to red, then rose straight up a little, then went away toward the South at a very fast speed. I heard no sound whatsoever.

1. In accordance with established policies for review, we request your evaluation and comments regarding the attached AF 112 and TT message.

2. The attached IR, with radar scope photos, is one of the finest received by this office in a number of years. It indicates a considerable effort, thoroughness and detail. All personnel involved were intensively very A weather communication, control unit and astronomical observatory in the area was contacted, and all A/C intercepts were 10100 hrs. to 6:00 a.m. next morning are given; A/C intercepts were 10100 to find the UVO and details detailed were taken from the pilots. As such, this report is considered complete for proper analysis.

3. Because of participation of so many activities and personnel in this sighting, a certain amount of publicity will undoubtedly arise. Therefore, expeditious action regarding this request would be appreciated.

4. Specific attention is invited to paragraph 2, Part III, which strongly indicates other unusual propagation or, possibly, interference somehow from another radar activity. Notice should be taken of the erratic movements and fantastic speed of the blips in question. Our computations indicate velocities approaching Mach. 25 (15,000 mph).
