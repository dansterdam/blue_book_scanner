AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Flight 2-D, 4602D AISS                 REPORT NO: 2D-UFOB-5-55 PART FIVE     PAGE 3 OF 9 PAGES

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was a rawinsonde weather balloon for the following reasons:

    a. Preparing Officer believes the balloon hypothesis fits the circumstances of this sighting.

    b. It is quite possible that the object sighted by T/Sgt Everett Woolum, A/2C Raymond E. Eutaneuer, and A/2C Wort L. Roberson, was a rawinsonde weather balloon, A rawinsonde weather balloon was released at 0330 CST Jun 14 (15/0202) from the Bryan Air Force Base, Weather Station, Bryan, Texas. The sighting of the object occurred shortly (30) minutes after the time of the release of the rawinsonde balloon.

    S/Sgt Vernon Gray of the Base Weather Station stated that in a period of thirty (30) minutes, the rawinsonde type balloon would reach an altitude of about thirty thousand (30,000) feet. All sources stated the object was sighted at an altitude of thirty thousand (30,000) feet. A/2C Eutaneuer stated the object actually looked like a weather balloon and that he had sighted the object for two minutes on the first sighting and for a period of three minutes on the second sighting.

    Preparing Officer believes this to be very long periods of time sighted and object travelling at speeds up to six hundred (600) miles per hour at thirty thousand feet.

    c. Bryan Air Force Base Weather Station reported the following information for 0330 15 Jun 55:

    Sky condition - clear

    Winds - 230 degrees    32 knots    at 25,000 feet
             230 degrees    45 knots    at 30,000 feet
             230 degrees    90 knots    at 35,000 feet

    d. Preparing Officer contacted 6th Weather Rawinsonde Detachment, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and received the following information: Rawinsonde balloons have been sighted in the area after dark, up to altitudes of forty thousand feet. The light on the balloon is attached to suspension train which carries a modulator unit. The suspension train is about one hundred feet in length. A light such as the one used for rawinsonde observation could be very deceiving to the eye at very high altitudes. Preparing Officer believes that the light attached to the train could have been oscillating, and this may have been the reason for the disappearing and reappearance of the object.

2. The Preparing Officer believes that the balloon and the UFOB are one in the same.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was questioned on the telephone so physical features were unknown. SOURCE carried on a very intelligent conversation and answered questions in a brief and organized manner. SOURCE was very well versed in the field of weather and technical matters. In the opinion of the investigator, it would be quite difficult to give a true estimate of the reliability of the SOURCE.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. SOURCE sighted object from observer tower located directly in front of Base Weather Station at Bryan AFB, Texas. At the time the SOURCE was making a radiosonde observation, a cylindrical shaped object appeared traveling at an estimated speed of five hundred (500) to six hundred (600) miles per hour. Object was first sighted in the southwest quadrant, shifting in heading from ten (10) to twenty (20) degrees, and then disappearing in the northwest quadrant at approximately thirty (30) degrees elevation. Object then reappeared in the southeast quadrant and then disappeared in the southwest quadrant in a straight trajectory, changing course to a heading of two hundred and seventy (270) degrees and then disappearing at an approximate elevation of thirty (30) degrees over the horizon. SOURCE stated that the object was sighted for no more than thirty (30) seconds at one sighting and object would then disappear. Object would disappear for a ten (10) minute period of time and then reappear.

2. Object was flying in a counter-clockwise circular flight path. Total time lapse, including sighting of the object was thirty (30) minutes, however, SOURCE stated he saw the object for a period of thirty (30) seconds, at three different intervals of time.

3. The object did not appear to make any actions to change brightness, shape or flicker. Speeds of the object were very exaggerated, ranging from three hundred (300) to six hundred (600) miles per hour.

4. The edges of the object were very smooth and solid, similar to that of an airfoil section.

5. SOURCE stated that object did not move in front of or behind anything, but he was definitely sure that object did not emit sound or smoke.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was contacted and questioned by telephone. SOURCE answered all questions in a concise and emphatic manner and seemed to be of average intelligence. In his opinion of investigator, that the SOURCE was fairly reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. SOURCE was making a weather observation on the night of 14 June 55 directly in front of the Sass Weather Station at Bryan AFB (GeoR Bldg 104A). The time of the observation was 0300Z 15 June. While the SOURCE was making the observation, an unknown object came into view. The object was sighted directly overhead and duration of the first sighting lasted about two minutes and the object then disappeared in the south. There was a lapse time of five minutes and the object then reappeared in the southwest quadrant flying directly north, then reversing its course one hundred and eighty (180) degrees, and then again disappearing. SOURCE stated the second time the object was sighted, he observed object for about three minutes making a total time of actually seeing the object five minutes.

2. The object seemed to vary in brightness at times and glow like a light on a weather balloon. SOURCE stated that the object was not a weather balloon because of the fact it was flying at an altitude of about thirty thousand (30,000) feet.

3. SOURCE stated that the object was cylindrical in shape and travelling at a speed of five hundred (500) to six hundred (600) miles per hour. Sunset on the day of the observation was at 1930 CST. There were a few stars in the sky, but the object seemed to be much brighter than any one particular star.

4. Object seemed to be about the size of a ten cent piece when held at arm's length.

5. On the night of the observation, the weather was warm, dry and the temperature was about eighty (80) degrees Fahrenheit.

6. SOURCE stated the object was white in color and completely absent of smoke or sound.
