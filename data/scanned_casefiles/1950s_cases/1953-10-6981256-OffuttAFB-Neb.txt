12. Position, title and comments of preparing officer. Navigator, Investigating Officer. After interviewing observers of sighting, questioning radar technicians and operators of the RBS site and Radar Repair property, it has been established that sightings similar to these have been made many times during recent years. These sightings are made often at the RBS site and they have called in radar agents that this is a phenomenon of microwave transmission and reception, probably aided by meteorological and astronomical activity.
