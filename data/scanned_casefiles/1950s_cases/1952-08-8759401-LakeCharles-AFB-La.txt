Lake Charles, Louisiana

About 0150 hours, Saturday, 9 Aug 1952, I was standing on a patch and block, west of the G.C.A. Webb hangar when I spotted a round-shaped object moving much to south until it crossed the 310 area. It appeared to move so perfectly to my second observation point at a direction in the west of the area it disappeared. The sky was cloudy in spots, but this didn't hamper visibility at all. The object seemed to be below the clouds. I noted no sound, but it did have terrific speed.

PAGE TWO:

[The rest of the text appears to be a typewritten document with some words partially illegible due to image quality. The text seems to be a detailed report with coordinates, locations, and technical language. However, without risking inserting incorrect text, I can only confidently state that the document appears to be a technical report related to a location (Lake Charles, LA is mentioned) with geographic coordinates and detailed observations.]

Some words and phrases are clearly visible, such as:
- "LAKE CHARLES"
- "LA COORDINATES"
- "ZERO"

But a full, accurate transcription would require a higher resolution image to ensure complete accuracy.
