UFO News Report
By THOMAS M. COMELLA

EXCLUSIVE—TRC STUDIES AMAZING COLOR PHOTO

OF UFO: TRC is now examining one of the most conclusive UFO photographs ever taken! It is not photographic detail which makes it stand out from other authentic pictures. It is the fact that the UFO involved is shown on a color Kodachrome slide.

The photographer was talking with his parents at approximately 9:30 p.m. in late August, 1955. He had his Kodak Pony camera Model B, 3.5 mm, with Kodachrome film. Suddenly, approaching from the north and followed a horizontal object, it moved toward the observers, the photograph took the picture. At its nearest point the object was not too large in the sky, it was generally agreed that the film probably would show nothing. However, when the slide was returned from the processing laboratory, a remarkable reproduction of the object was present. The object was trail behind it was a deep blue color. The naked eye. The nifying glass the object takes on a definite disc-with a mag- rounding blue glow!

The disc involved is certainly not a light from any airborne object. The observers heard or saw nothing except the brilliant light using the photo for a period of time, it is realized that the only possible known object that could account for such an image is a meteor. However, meteors usually burn out in full view of the observer, but this object didn't. Also, meteors follow curved trajectories toward the ground, but this object followed a horizontal trajectory.

There are so fast that ordinary cameras will not stop their motion. Even astronomical cameras are not capable of this. Photographs of meteors merely show a straight line on the film. The object in question was obviously not traveling at meteoric speeds because the simple Kodak camera stopped its motion!

Also, the observer states that all witnesses watched the object for a long time in order to get a good look at it and photograph it at some length of time any meteor would be far gone and, if by some fantastic chance the observer did get a photograph of it, the white disc would only appear as a thin, white line and not a blue-white disc!

Study of this unusual photograph is still underway. A television photo expert has informed TRC that, in his opinion, the object is an authentic photograph of some kind of space craft moving through the Earth's upper atmosphere at incredible speed. Physicists have decided that the strange trail or tail could be due to ionization of the atmosphere.

At any rate, the photograph remains one of the most conclusive pieces of evidence of extra-terrestrial visitation!
