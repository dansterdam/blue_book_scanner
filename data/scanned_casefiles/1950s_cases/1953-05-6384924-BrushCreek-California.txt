BRUSH CREEK, Calif. (UP)- Preston said he told the men he couldn't give them permission to shoot anything. "Flying saucer" manned by broad-shouldered little men next time so they'll have some lights on, he said. Black and Van Allen, who have been camping in the remote Marble Creek area, told Sheriff's Capt. Fred Preston the story.

They said they landed twelve hours earlier at a sand bar in the Marble Creek area. They got out, scooped up a pail of water and landed it to someone hidden in the brush. "We'll all right to take a shot at the contraption next time we see it," they said. They said it landed first on a three-legged stand.

Gold Miners Teetotally Sure They Saw It—a Baby Saucer

Brush Creek, Calif., June 25 (U.P)—Two gold miners, neither of them drinking men, complained today that a flying saucer with a couple of little men in it keeps showing up at their diggings near here.

Obtained John G. Miles and his partner, John Van Allen, said they've just "to a T" seen this thing next time it lands near their small gold mine in the Marble Creek area.

It landed first on May 20 and again on June 20, they said. They look for it to come back again.

The miners told Sheriff's Capt. Tom Phelan that when the saucer comes down, a broad-shouldered little man can get out and scoop up a pail of water. He hands it to someone inside, climbs back in and the saucer shoots away again.

Details, including a landing at the sand bar at the junction of Marble and Jordan Creeks, setting a three-legged landing gear that leaves tracks as big "elephant tracks," they said. They described it as "being about seven feet in diameter and four feet thick."

Re Weaver a Parks.

The little man, they said, was wearing somewhat like a long-length pants and his arms and legs appeared "to be covered with a heavy tweed material."

Mrs. Vi Belcher, operator of the Brush Creek store, said the miners had a good reputation and were noted for their sobriety.

Two Miners Fly Off Handle at a Saucer

BRUSH CREEK, Calif., June 25 (UP) - Two excited gold miners today told a broad-shouldered military intelligence officer they saw a "flying saucer" at their mountain diggings.

The miners, John Q. Black and John Van Allen, said they were tempted to fire away at the thing next time it shows up.

Messrs. Black and Van Allen who have a reputation for sobriety, told Sheriff's Capt. Preston the "saucer" has landed twice near their small gold mine on the creek in the remote Marble Creek area. Each time, they said, a little man got out, scooped up a pail of water and handled it somehow inside.

The miners asked Capt. Preston to shoot at the contraption next time they see it. On May 20 and again on June 21, they said, it will be back on July 22.

Capt. Preston said he told the men he couldn't give them permission to shoot at anything. It told them they'd better grab their guns so they'll have something to shoot at next time.

Capt. Preston said, "He wasn't planning any investigation but he had "informed the Air Force."

The miners said the "saucer" came down on a sand bar at the junction of two creeks, using a three-legged landing gear that retracted when it took off. The landing gear left marks on the sand, and also some of the miners said, Black and Van Allen described the object as being about seven feet in diameter and about four feet thick. The little man who "got out" was wearing something like a "work-length parks" and his arms and legs seemed covered with a heavy wood material, the miners said.

JULY 20, 1953 BRUSH CREEK, CALIFORNIA                    (BARKER P 37)        2 WITNESSES:

HAVE OBSERVED A SMALL MAN ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

SEEN FROM 150 FEET AWAY. THE LITTLE MAN WORE GREEN TROUSERS, A JACKET AND A TIE. HIS SHOES WERE 'PARTICULARLY STRANGE IN THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE SO REMARKABLY FLEXIBLE. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE DISTINCTLY RECOGNIZABLE AS SHOES, THEY SEEMED ALMOST TO BE A PART OF THE MAN'S FEET.

THE OUTFIT WAS TOPPED OFF WITH A GREEN CAP OVER BLACK HAIR.

HE LOOKED LIKE A NORMAL PERSON EXCEPT FOR THE SMALL STATURE AND SOMEWHAT ODD, DRESS. THE WALK WAS STIFF, AS IF HIS MUSCLES WERE CRAMPED. HE WAS BROAD-SHOULDERED, APPEARED TO BE STRONG, AND WAS RATHER GOOD-LOOKING - FOR A SAUCERMAN. HE WAS VERY PALE.

AS BLACK PUT IT, "HE LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAD NEVER BEEN OUT IN THE SUN MUCH."

HE WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE ACTIVITY OF THE LITTLE MAN, WHO WAS DIPPING A BUCKET OF WATER FROM THE CREEK. THE BUCKET HAD A FLAT ROUND BOTTOM AND A BAIL, BUT HE HAD NEVER SEEN A BUCKET QUITE LIKE IT. THE SIDES FLARED OUT LIKE THE SEGMENTS OF A CONE. IT LOOKED LIKE ALUMINUM, OR SOME OTHER SHINY METAL. (NOTE: PHOTO - WAUKEGAN NEWS SUN 12/19/50)

AS HE CREPT CLOSER TO GET A BETTER LOOK, HE STEPPED ON A DRY STICK. THE LITTLE MAN HEARD THE NOISE, LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE CREEK, BUT APPARENTLY DIDN'T SEE BLACK, OBSCURED BY TREES AND BRUSH, HE HURRIED TO A SAUCER STANDING NEARBY, GOT INTO THE THING AND WAS OFF.

THE BEST WAY COULD DESCRIBE THE SAUCER WAS THAT IT LOOKED LIKE TWO LARGE SOUP PLATES FASTENED TOGETHER, FORMING A CONVEX SHAPE. IT WAS A SHINY METALLIC COLOR, AND NO RIVETS WERE VISIBLE. HE ESTIMATED THE SIZE AS ABOUT EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND A HALF FEET THICK AT THE CENTER. IT WAS RESTING ON A CYLINDRICAL PIPE-LIKE UNDERSTRUCTURE FOR WHICH HAND-HOLDS JUTTED AT INTERVALS, LIKE THE SPIKES ON A TELEPHONE POLE.

THERE WAS A WINDOW IN THE SIDE OF THE SAUCER, BUT IT AFFORDED NO VIEW OF THE INTERIOR. IT WAS SUPPOSED IT WAS A WINDOW. IT LOOKED LIKE ONE. THERE WAS NO SMELL OF GAS OR ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE.

THE LITTLE MAN CLIMBED UP THE PIPE-LIKE UNDERSTRUCTURE. HIS FEET, IN THEIR ODDLY FLEXIBLE SHOES, CURLED AROUND SPIKE. HE CLIMBED UNTIL ALL OF HIS BODY ABOVE THE KNEES HAD VANISHED THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE BASE OF THE SAUCER, THEN SEEMED TO SIT DOWN AND LIFT UP HIS LEGS. THE CRAFT ROCKED AS HE SAT, IN, THE BASE WAS DRAWN UP INTO THE BODY, AND THE SAUCER HOVERED IN THE AIR FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN TOOK OFF AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE WITH A HISSING SOUND.

NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION COULD BE OBSERVED. ON ONE OCCASION EITHER JUNE 20 OR MAY 20, THE EFFICIENT CONTROL OF THE MACHINE WAS EVIDENT AS IT WAS RISING THROUGH SOME TREES, WITHOUT ROOM TO CLEAR THE TOPS. IT SLIPPED SIDEWAYS BETWEEN THEM UNTIL IT GAINED ALTITUDE. ON ONE OCCASION IT WAS SEEN TO WOBBLE.

2. On 7 July 1953, a letter was received from the Commander, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, dated 29 June 1953, Subj: "Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object, Brush Creek, California," which quoted a news item as follows:

"BRUSH CREEK, Calif., June 24-(UP)- Two grizzled miners today asked the Butte County sheriff's office for permission to shoot at a midget-manned 'flying saucer' that keeps invading their mountain diggings.

The miners, [redacted] and [redacted], who operated a small gold mine in the remote Marble Creek area a few miles north of here, told Sheriff's Capt. Fred Preston the 'saucer' landed twice on a sandbar at the junction of Marble and Jordan Creeks.

Each time, they said, a little man resembling a midget got out of the contraption, scooped up a bucket of water in a shiny pail, and handed it to someone inside.

When he saw them, they said, he jumped into the 'saucer' and it zoomed away without making a sound.

The object was described as having a tripod landing gear which left marks on the sandbar. The observers stated the craft was manned."

The letter further stated that the unidentified object had been sighted on 20 May and 20 June 1953.

If Little Men Come Back
A Fine Reception's Waiting

OROVILLE, July 18 - Little men from outer space, you've been warned. They're waiting for you.

If it's just a quiet bucker of water you want, Brush Creek's going to be a turbulent place to get it from. There's going to be an earthstyle reception - radio broadcasters, newspaper men, magazine writers, crowds, everything.

You may not like it.
This reception is the result of reports made by two gold miners, John G. Black and John Van Allen.

For the past two months, on the 20th of the month, at exactly 6:30 p.m. a flying saucer has landed near their claim at Brush Creek, they say. Each time the same thing happens: a small, broad-shouldered midget, wearing a green park, climb out, scoops up a pail of water, then takes off in his machine again with a noise like the hissing of a steam boiler.

For the last two months, the miners have been too startled to make a move. But this time they, and the public, are ready.

If, in spite of the welcome waiting for them, the little men do decide to show up July 20, it is requested that they kindly be punctual, as the national radio network which will have its commentator on the scene gets very annoyed if its programs do not begin on time.

Those Little Spacemen
Didn't Appear Yesterday

BRUSH CREEK, Calif. (UP) - Miner John Q. Black said today he was "damn disappointed" that the little men from Mars didn't show up in their flying saucer with the retraction is "I" 

Don't know why they didn't come. I was waiting for them. I'm just a miner.

Black and his partner, John Van Allen, had predicted the saucer would arrive at the Junction of Marble and Jordan creeks at 6:30 p.m. yesterday.

Black claimed to have seen the saucer seven times before. He and his partner said they saw it at 6:20 on May 20 and June 20 at the same spot. "I thought maybe it would be visible last night on a monthly schedule."

About 300 people, including newsmen and photographers, scanned the skies all day yesterday in hopes of seeing the silver-colored saucer land on the sandpit in a remote mountain area.

Black and Van Allen said when they saw the "saucer" before, a little man about four feet tall in a forest green park got out scooped as water from the creek in a bucket and passed it to another occupant in the saucer. Then the saucer took off without a trace.

A small crowd of about 20 or 25 was on hand at the junction of the two creeks at the appointed hour. All they got was sun in their eyes.
