Miners Plan To Ambush Saucer And Little Men
BRUSH CREEK, Calif. (UP) - The miners declared that they saw a strange orange-colored flying object and saw what resembled "little men" working around it. They said they plan to ambush the object and its occupants the next time it appears. The miners claim they saw the object hovering above the remote Marble Creek area. They said they believe the object may have been searching for uranium deposits in the area. The miners asked if it would be legal for them to take arms against the object and its occupants the next time they appear. They claim they will be on the lookout for the object, which they said appeared to be about four feet in diameter, and about four feet long with a dome on top. The object, they said, was spotted on June 29.

Gold Miners Teetotally Sure They Saw It--A Baby Saucer
Brush Creek, Calif., June 25 (U.P.)--Two gold miners, neither of them drinking men, complained today that a flying saucer with a couple of little men in it keeps showing up at their diggings near here.
"We were just sitting and resting and this thing came drifting down," said partner, John Van Allen,* said they beter not try to get anyr closer, "It was here a few minutes and then up and away again."
The gold mine is the Marble Creek section. It looked like some kind of machine, they said. When they looked for it to come back on later checks, it was gone--except on the second day, when one miner said he thought he saw it but couldn't be sure.
Miss VT Batcher, curator of the county museum, said the two gold miners had a good reputation and were noted for their sobriety.

According to reports, the anomalous object flew at about 1500 miles per hour. John C. Black, a San Francisco artist who was fishing near the site, also reportedly saw the object. A.C. Adams and Allan came to the office of Sheriff's Capt. Willard Allen that same month and said they wanted to report a similar experience. They claimed to have been closely followed by an object moving at high speed and descried as a glowing metallic disc "which flashed its lights on and off". They said they were attacked by a reputation of truthful, respectable citizens.

TWO MINERS FLY OFF HANDLE AT A SAUCER
BRUSH CREEK, PA. - Two miners on their way to work at a near-by gold mine came upon a strange object and tried to approach it, according to a report received here.
The object was described as a bright, metallic disc-shaped object that kept bothering them as they made their way to the mine. John Van Allen, one of the miners, said they tried to approach the object but it would not allow them to get near it.
The object would come near them and then dart away, the report stated. The miners said the object was about four feet thick. They said they tried to approach it but it sped away. The miners said it seemed to be about 15-20 feet in diameter.
"If it would be all right to take a shot at it I certainly would," one of the miners was quoted as saying. "But it went away too fast for us to get a shot."
The report stated the incident occurred on May 25, 1953.

JULY 20, 1953 BRUSH CREEK, CALIFORNIA (BARKER P 37) 2 WITNESSES:
HAVE OBSERVED A SMALL MAN ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. CLAIM TO BE OPERATING TITANIUM DIGGINGS. CLAIM TO BE PART OF THE LITTLE MAN'S CREW. MAN WORE GREEN TROUSERS, JACKET AND MOCCASINS. HIS HAIR WAS LONG AND STRINGY. THEY SEEMED ALMOST TO BE PART OF THE MAN-'S FEET. THE OUTFIT WAS TOPPED OFF WITH A GREEN SHAWL OR BLACK HAIR.
THE CREATURE LOOKED LIKE A NORMAL PERSON EXCEPT FOR THE SMALL STATUE AND SOMEWHAT ODDLOOKING. THEY HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE BELL-LIKE CHIMES COMING FROM HIM ON OCCASION. HE WAS VERY PALE, ALMOST AS BLACK PUT IT. HE LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE WHO WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE ACTIVITY OF THE LITTLE MAN, WHO WAS DIPPING AND WORKING ON THE GROUND. THE SECOND TIME THEY CAME ACROSS HIM, HE PLAINLY LOOKED OUT LIKE THE SEGMENTS OF A CONE. IT LOOKED LIKE ALUMINUM, OR SOME SHINY MATERIAL. WHEN HE CREPT CLOSER TO GET A BETTER LOOK, HE STEPPED ON A DRY STICK AND THE LITTLE MAN HEARD IT. HE STOPPED AND LOOKED AROUND. THE CREATURE RAN RAPIDLY OBSCURED BY TREES AND BUSHES. WE HURRIED TO A SAUCER LANDING IN NEARBY GROUND. IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT LOOKED LIKE TWO LARGE SOUP PLATES FASTENED TOGETHER, FORMING A CONVEX SHAPE. IT WAS A SHINY METALLIC COLOR, AND REVOLVED IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION. IT LOOKED TO BE APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER. THERE WAS A WINDOW IN THE SIDE OF THE SAUCER, BUT IT AFFORDED NO VIEW OF THE INSIDE. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF GAS OR ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE. THE LITTLE MAN LOOKED SOMEWHAT LIKE UNDERSTURES, HIS FEET, IN THEIR STEPS, SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO CRUSH HARD, CRYSTALLIZED ROCK. HIS GAIT WAS VERY STRANGE, ALMOST WOBBLING AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE OPENING. THE CRAFT ROSE STRAIGHT UP FROM THE GROUND, AND THE SAUCER HOVERED IN THE AIR FOR SEVERAL SECONDS, THEN TOOK OFF AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED. JUNGLEMAN OR SAUCERS MAY SOME EFFICIENT METHOD OF PROPULSION COULD BE OBSERVED ON THESE OCCASIONS. EITHER JUNGLEMAN OR SAUCER MADE SOME SORT OF NOISE TO GAIN CONTROL AS EVIDENCED BY SOUND WAVES TRANSMITTED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM UNTIL IT GAINED ALTITUDE. ON ONE OCCASION IT WAS SEEN TO WOBBLE AS IT LEFT.

Text extracted from the image:

1. Investigation requested by Commander, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. SUBJECT: Information concerning an unidentified Aerial Object that had been sighted at Brush Creek, Butte County, California, on 20 May and 20 June 1953 by two miners.

2. On 7 July 1953, a letter was received from the Commander, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, dated 29 June 1953. Subj: "Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object, Brush Creek, California", which quoted a news item as follows:

"BRUSH CREEK, Calif., June 24--(UP)--Two grizzled miners today asked the Butte County Sheriff's office for permission to shoot at a "flying saucer" that keeps invading their mountain diggings."

The miners, who operated a small gold mine in a remote area a few miles north of Brush Creek, Fed Freeso and Joe Garcia, had observed the object twice on the afternoon of 20 June. It hovered at the junction of Marble and Jordon Creeks.

Each time, they said, a little man resembling a midget got out of the contraption, scoped up a bucket of water in a shiny pail, and then zoomed back inside and away without making a sound.

The object was described as having a tripod landing gear which left marks on the sandbar. The observers stated the craft was "trimmed."

The letter further stated that the unidentified object had been sighted on 20 May and 20 June 1953.

AT OROVILLE, CALIFORNIA

Sheriff's Office advised that two miners on 24 June 1953 reported sighting an unidentified Aerial Object near Brush Creek. Headquarters at the direction of Butte County Supervisor CHRISTENSEN further advised that neither sheriff's office in Oroville or in Butte County was known to have taken any action regarding the reported incident and that inasmuch as the reported sightings have occurred on the 20th of the preceding two months, the Sheriff's office had discontinued an unrehersed (sic) to the observed.

SECURITY INFORMATION
Scene of the reporting sighting on 20 July 1953, to be on hand in the event the said miners reported another sighting. It is believed that through news medium, many people have read of the previous sighting on hand on 20 July 1953, to witness another "possible landing of the objects."

AT BRUSH CREEK, CALIFORNIA
1. On 20 July 1953, Sgt WALTER JOHNSON, star #1117, California Highway Patrol, who had been called to assist in traffic control, advised he had talked with both JOE JOHNSON and WM. HUNTER, earlier in the day. JOHNSON stated both men were confident in their story of the previous sightings of the objects, but that both gave vague and conflicting accounts when questioned about the date, time, duration and further details of the sighting. JOHNSON did not know anything concerning the miners' backgrounds, or of their reputation for unreliability in the area.

2. On 20 July 1953, District Ranger WILLIAM E. TURPIN, Plumas National Forest, advised the known facts are approximately three (3) years, and that neither of the two appear to be drinkers. TURPIN further advised his name has been visited due to numerous occasions that he has ordered them, several times, to clean up the camp area, to reduce five hazard, and that approximately two weeks prior thereto, they had burned "considerable unclassified material." TURPIN stated the two have not filed for claim on the encounter, to the best of TURPIN's knowledge, the two have never taken anything resembling ore from the mine area or the surrounding area, and TURPIN did not know anything concerning the background or reliability of either of the men, or where they reside in Quincy.

AT OROVILLE, CALIFORNIA
3. On 24 July 1953, Undersheriff BERT W. LUCAS, Butte County Sheriff's Office, advised the investigators that LUCAS was present at Brush Creek on 20 July 1953, and had not questioned either miners on the subjects, nor did he know anything concerning the background or reliability of the two men. LUCAS stated he did not know anything concerning the details of the sightings as reporters representing papers from Chico, Oroville, and Sacramento, California, had been present on the 20th, and would be more broad casting it.

Those Little Spacemen Didn't Appear Yesterday
Some local residents, including photographers, scanned the skies all day yesterday in hopes of seeing the silver cigar-shaped object reported over Brush Creek at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. 
Those interested in the sighting, including Black and Van Allen, said when interviewed the "occupants" before jumping into the saucer were about four feet tall in height, and that a little man about three and a half feet in height and two other occupants in the saucer. Then the "saucer" took off, without a sound.
It was far above as the function of the
ARD showed it was accelerating rapidly. As they lifted up, it appeared to turn on its edge.
