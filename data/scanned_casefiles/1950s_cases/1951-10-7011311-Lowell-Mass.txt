Lowell, Mass.
October 14, 1951

To Whom It Concerns:

On October 14, 1951 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Marilyn Joan Quinlan, and myself Judy Dwyer while outside playing, were attracted by a glittering object, calling my father John D. Dwyer, but when he came out the objects disappeared. We were greatly discouraged when my father couldn't locate them. I had read in a magazine, Open Road, telling about flying saucers. We hope you do not think that we are imagining anything, and we would appreciate any information leading to the two objects which we saw on that particular day.

Singerly Yours,

[Signature and additional text are blacked out]
