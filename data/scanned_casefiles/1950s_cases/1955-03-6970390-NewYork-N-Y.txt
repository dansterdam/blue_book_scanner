AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Most of the text is illegible or obscured by black redaction marks. The document appears to be an official Air Force form with multiple sections, but the specific details cannot be read clearly.]

At the top of the document, the header reads "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" and there are several holes punched at the top of the page.

The bottom of the document shows some partially visible text, but it is too blurry and faint to accurately transcribe.


- page 3 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality. There appears to be a faint government document header and footer, and a faint seal or emblem in the center of the page, but the specific text cannot be clearly read.


- page 4 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality and low contrast. Only a few fragments of text can be partially discerned, but they are not clear enough to confidently transcribe. The document appears to be a form or report with some printed lines and boxes, but the specific details cannot be read.


- page 5 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

[Top of form header section - partially legible]
Date: 4 Mar 55
Type of Observation: Ground Visual
Length of Observation: 15-20 min

[Most of the top section text is too faint/blurry to read completely]

[Bottom of form has some text that is mostly illegible]

The document contains a schematic/diagram with curved lines and a small silhouette of a human figure standing within a circular area. The diagram appears to be some kind of trajectory or observation chart.

The bottom of the document has a form footer with some text, but most of it is too faint to read clearly.


- page 6 -

Most of the text on this document is illegible due to the low contrast and faded nature of the scanned image. There appears to be some text in the header and footer areas, but I cannot confidently read the specific words. There is a circular/oval shape drawn in the upper right portion of the document and what seems to be a schematic or diagram of some buildings or structures in the lower portion of the page. However, I cannot make out any specific text with certainty.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Date: 6, 1602 hrs
Location: [Redacted/Illegible]

[Most of the text body is too faint/blurry to be reliably OCR'd. Some words are visible but not enough to construct a coherent paragraph.]

The document appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report with significant portions of the text redacted or obscured. The document has two hole punches at the top and appears to be a vintage military/government document from the 1950s.


- page 8 -

Some text appears to be illegible due to the image quality. Here's what I can clearly read:

[Top of document appears to have standard form header fields, but text is not fully legible]

First paragraph begins with text about New York, but most details are not clearly readable.

[Middle paragraphs are mostly illegible]

At the bottom of the document, there appears to be a signature and some additional text, but the details are not clear enough to transcribe accurately.

The document appears to be an official report or communication, likely related to a Project Blue Book UFO investigation in New York, but the specific details cannot be confidently extracted due to poor image resolution.

EXPLANATION

ISOBARS are straight, horizontal brown lines. The heights in feet of the pressure surfaces in the U.S. Standard atmosphere are in parentheses to the left of the pressure values on the left.

ISOTHERMS (°C) are the straight, equidistant brown lines running diagonally upward from left to right.

DRY ADIABATS are the slightly curved brown lines that intersect the 1000 mb. isobar at intervals of 2°C, and run diagonally upward from right to left.

The Dry Adiabats for the 1000 mb level are labeled with bar (2) values. (See below)

SATURATED ADIABATS are the curved green lines that intersect the 1000 mb. isobar at intervals of 2°C, diverging upward and tending to become parallel to the dry adiabats.

SATURATION MIXING RATIO (in gm. per kg.) is represented by dashed green lines.

THICKNESS (in hundreds of geopotential feet) of the layers between the levels 1000, 700, 500, 300, 150 and 100 mb. is represented by numbers and a graduation along the middle of each layer. The thicknesses are obtained from the virtual temperature curve by the equal-area method, using any straight line as a dividing line.

HEIGHT in geopotential feet above mean sea level, or station level, of the 1000 mb. surface is obtained from the monogram in the upper left-hand corner by drawing a straight line from the point on the temperature scale (T°) through the point on the pressure scale (P) to the desired point, and reading the height on the height scale.

U.S. STANDARD ATMOSPHERE SOUNDING is indicated by a thick brown line.

The saturated adiabats and geopoths of extension mixing ratio are compiled to use over vapor pressure curve of plane water surface at all temperatures.

Extension of chart to 50 mb. has been accomplished by overlap with previous indicated in brackets, [200] at 400 mb, and [50] at 100 mb. Dry adiabats for the overlap are labeled in parentheses ( ).

APPROXIMATE VIRTUAL TEMPERATURE may be obtained from the formula Tv = T + E where Tv is virtual temperature in °C, T is free air temperature in °C, and w is mixing ratio in grams/kilogram. For purposes of thickness computation, use the mean temperature of the layer for T and use the mean mixing ratio of the layer for w.

Sounding data will be entered on two (2) sets of charts. One chart will include 1500Z and 1800Z soundings; the other 0300Z and 2100Z soundings. Pressure levels will be entered to the nearest 50 mb. Soundings, whichever the case may be, will be entered as a trace of the temperature curve without the reproduction of data or editing of any point. (See AWM-106-22)

Black dots = along wind scale lines indicate the levels for which wind data is reported and plotted. The open circles O indicate the mandatory pressure levels at which wind data is also entered.
