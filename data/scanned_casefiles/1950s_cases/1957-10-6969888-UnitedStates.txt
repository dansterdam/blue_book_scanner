AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED

1. Description:
a. Shape: Circular, globel
b. Size: Very difficult to determine but it appeared to be about 20 miles distance, however, it appeared to be much greater distance.
c. Color: Silver-white, seemed to light blue, golden, pink, silver, pinkish red.
d. Number: One, with a small spot just to the west of it, appeared to be the same size of the larger body, for the last part of the sighting.
e. Formation: Small object just to the west of larger.
f. Features: Circular, globel, seemed to split and then reform, however this could have been an illusion as the object's distance.
g. Tail or exhaust: None
h. Sound: None noticed.
i. Other Features: Brighter at some times, very much brighter than any stars or other objects in the sky.
j. Description of course: Moved from position 1 220 degrees from Larsen AFS at 20,000 feet above the horizon at 01:02 to position 2 220 degrees from Larson where it dropped below the horizon at 01:05.
3. Manner of Observation:
a. Observation called to my attention by Mr. of operations at Larson AFS. I watched it using binoculars from the roof of the Base Operations and could track it very easily. It then went behind the trees and I lost sight of it.
b. I stepped on the roof of Base Operations and could spot it very easily with no difficulty. I then went to the Control Tower for a better look.
c. It appeared circular in shape, 40 to 50 thousand feet up and seemed to change shape slightly as I watched it. It split in half and then came together, an estimated 15 to 20 seconds between the two halves.
A. Time and date of observation: 20 Oct 57 01102 to 02502. 6/19-4 = 1710 brd
B. Location of observation: Larson AFB Operations and Control Tower, 47°12'W.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text-based description of a comet's head and tail. The text discusses the characteristics of the comet, such as its brightness, appearance, and behavior, as observed by astronomers. There is no human face or identification visible in the image.

ASTRONOMY

COMET'S HEAD AND TAIL

A COMET's head and tail is when her photographed, the tail was more now reaming nearly skies. By Dr. Willem J. Luyten, astronomer of the Observatory at Harvard College: 

A comet's head and tail are of extreme interest. After the comet's center and part of its head, which generally brighten into the form of a double envelope, the tail streams out into space. This comet, which appears near the sun every six or seven years, and is now one of the brightest comets in recent memory, attracts a great deal of attention from those who study it in the Northern Hemisphere. 

This comet appears much smaller than many comets of the past, but it has an extremely interesting feature seldom seen in comets, and said to result from the new acceleration observed in some recent comets. Dr. Whipple, director of the Harvard Observatory at Cambridge, Mass., has proposed that the comet's acceleration is due to a strange expulsion of material from its nucleus, rather like a flare of gas from the sun. Whether this theory is correct, however, remains to be seen.

Cometary experts at present seem to know very little about the process or mechanism of this extraordinary acceleration, and whether it is connected with the strange doubleness of the comet's envelopes mentioned above. But as more knowledge of the acceleration becomes available, the astronomy world may learn much from this remarkable celestial visitor.
