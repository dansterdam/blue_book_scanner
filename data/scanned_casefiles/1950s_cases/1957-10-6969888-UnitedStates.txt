6. Object distant, ball shaped, silvery, moving west.

7. Weather and winds aloft at time and place of sighting:
   a. Weather clear, visibility unlimited, 2400Z 20 Oct 57
   b. Wind (from Larson Weather)   6,000'- 030/15

   c. Ceiling, (None) clear.
   d. Visibility: Unlimited, more than 200 miles. Mt. Rainier observed.
   e. Clouds: None
   f. Thunderstorms: None

8. Any other conditions: None

9. Interception or identification taken: Notified "Igloo Control" on hot line, asked if they could pick up object on radar. They were unable to, but did sight it with naked eye. Asked if they would try to intercept with jet or notify another radar station to pick up object, they said they believed object to be PLUTO, so no interception deemed necessary.

10. No other known traffic in vicinity.

11. Preparing Officer: Captain Leo Polnaszek A0860976, Base Airdrome Officer,
    C-124 Aircraft Commander. At first I assumed object to be a large balloon with
    the sun reflecting off it, but as soon as it grew dark I assumed it to be part of
    the solar system, however, it appeared to move too fast for this.

12. No other evidence.

[Handwritten notes at bottom]
An astro plot shows Venus to be in the reported area at the time reported.

1. Description:
   a. Shape: Circular - Global
   b. Size: Very difficult to determine as distance was undetermined but it appeared
   larger than a large 120 feet balloon at 50 miles distance; however, it appeared to
   be a much greater distance away.
   c. Color: Silver, changing to light blue, golden, pink, silver, pinkish red.
   d. Number: One with a small spot just to the west of the larger body for the
   latter part of the sighting.
   e. Formation: Small object just to the west of larger.
   f. Features: Circular, global. Seemed to split and then reform, however this
   could have been an illusion as the object's distance was hard to determine.
   g. Tail or exhaust: None
   h. Sounds: None noticed.
   i. Other features: Brighter at some times, very much brighter than any stars
   or other objects in the sky.

2. Description of course: Moved from position 200° from Larson AFB at 100° elevation
   above the horizon at 01102 to position 240° from Larson where it dropped below the
   horizon at 0250z.

3. Manner of Observation:
   a. Object first called to my attention by Mr. [redacted] of
   Moses Lake, Washington by telephone at 01102, 20 Oct 57. (Phone [redacted]). He stated,
   "A bright spot, silvery, circular in shape, like the sun, SSE of Moses Lake moving in
   westerly direction."
   b. I stepped on the roof of Base Operations and could spot it very easily with
   the naked eye, also studied the object with field glasses. I then went to the Control
   Tower for a better look.
   c. It appeared circular in shape 40 to 50 thousand feet up and seemed to change
   shape slightly. It sort of split in half and then come together. I estimated it
   to be 150 to 200 miles from Larson, possibly over Portland, Oregon. At this time I
   could clearly see Mt. Rainier, Mt. Hood, and other mountain ranges against the light
   sky background. By 01452 it was a bit lower on the horizon, had become brighter,
   changed color from silver to light blue, from golden to pink, from pinkish red to
   silver. A small object, just a speck, appeared just to the west of the larger object
   and stayed along that side until the larger object disappeared under the horizon at
   0250z. Just prior to its going below the horizon, it changed color from silver to
   blue, to pink, then a red in orange, like the sun does prior to its setting below
   the horizon.

4. Time and date of observation: 20 Oct 57, 01102 to 0250z. 0110-3 = 1710 local

5. Location of observation: Larson AFB Operations and Control Tower, 47°12'N,
   119°10'W.

ASTRONOMY

Comet's Head and Tail

▶ A COMET confusing head and tail is now roaming nearby skies.

Dr. Elizabeth Romer, astronomer of the U.S. Naval Observatory, Flagstaff, Ariz., reported that the comet (here ground the peculiarity of Encke's comet) generally blends into the tail of a comet, a almost on the opposite side of the tail in Encke's comet.

This comet, which reappears near the sun every three and a third years, was observed at Flagstaff until it went too low on the horizon to study in the Northern Hemisphere.

Dr. Romer said the displacement of the coma in relation to the tail was "a very interesting feature" seldom seen in comets. She said it could possibly be that the coma and tail merely appear to be opposite because of the angle from which it is viewed from earth.

The comet's tail continued to get brighter and longer during the time it was observed.

When last photographed, the tail was more than two degrees long.

Although the comet is now very close to the sun, it will reappear in March for observation in the Northern Hemisphere.

"On again-off again" acceleration. It has been observed to speed up for no accountable reason and no precise calculations of the acceleration have been made so far, Dr. Romer said.

Dr. Fred L. Whipple, director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, Mass., has proposed that the comet's acceleration is due to a jet stream shooting out from its rotating center.

Dr. Roemer said she does not know whether this is large enough to account for the comet's acceleration, or if acceleration exists at the present time. However, she expects more knowledge of the acceleration may result from data gathered in May.
