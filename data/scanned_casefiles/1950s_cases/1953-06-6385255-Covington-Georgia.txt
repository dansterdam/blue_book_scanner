The object was a light described as a ball of fire by observers which drifted into view from the North, drifted slowly in a circle, estimated as 1 to 1½ miles in diameter, several times and disappeared to the West. Observers estimated it was for 30 to 35 minutes. Mr. Cook did not arrive on the scene until after 10:40 PM. Estimated altitude - 500 to 1000 feet. No chase. No test. Speed estimated as slow drift. Altitude on first report 12 June (OCC 570) was estimated at one mile. Also first report indicated object was SE of Covington; now states West which would be toward Atlanta Airport.

In connection with EXCERPT CG 570 on reported fireball received by ATIC, request you forward AF Form 112 as per AF Letter 200-5. ATIC has information which indicates a local meteor shower at that time and date of sighting. The fact that the object was circling and had no exhaust trail would eliminate this possibility, however.

Request you reaffirm these characteristics. Also check local weather balloon flights at 0900.

25 June 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson;

Of the last batch of 6 items sent on June 15, the only one about which there is any question is the 12 June Covington, Georgia. It is essential to know here the duration of sighting. A lot depends on this. Can you get this for us?

Regarding the Detroit 11 June 'case is there anything in this that a good landing light would not explain? Likewise Googe AFB 11 June it would appear that some second radar not pick up the signal, the most probable explanation is faulty radar. I assume that the GCI had radar available.

And we still have Venus with us. The 9 June Oregon case is clearly and unequivocally Venus.

Jennie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up questions which by now you may have obtained the answers.

Anything new on:
5 March Shaw AFB
3 March Luke AFB - Film?
17 Feb. Port Austin
25 March San Antonio
12 April Stead AFB

I am anxiously awaiting Jennie's clearance so we can get organized in a more business-like manner. I know you can't do anything about this, but just mentioning it anyway. I hope it comes through before your successor is appointed.

Cordially,
Allen Hynek

1. Attached is questionnaire completed as per ATIC briefing at this
Division. Questionnaire was completed by telephone. Source of original
report, Mr. Cook did not actually see the object but questioned all who
did and in opinion of this officer had performed a good job of collecting
the information available. Mr. Cook is the Ground Observer Post Supervisor
for that area working under the Atlanta Filter Center.

2. Object described as a ball of fire was in the opinion of this
officer either:

a. An air craft approaching the Atlanta airport and circling to land.
The airport is approximately 30 miles West of Porterdale but an aircraft
coming in on Course 6 or VPA from the NE would have been much closer.
a dark night with no moon and no clouds such as this night was described
an aircraft light could have been seen from a great distance without being
the aircraft or hearing it. Also such an approach would have taken 10 to
20 minutes. The correlation between the direction of the light and the
airport is the strongest support this type of erroneous observation not
exactly consistent with a local ground observation.

b. A weather balloon released either from Atlanta Municipal airport
or other locations. Balloons released at Atlanta and Douglas at 0900Z.
Wind was prevailing from the North but according to Mr. Cook was slight
at Porterdale. Allowing for variances in wind and possible erroneous time
reporting this could have been a balloon. Stonecrest factor is the "slow
drift" described. According to Atlanta Weather Station balloon released
at 0900Z could have been over Porterdale as at 0300S as a westerly wind
encountered. Balloon was lost at-0314Z at 14,000 feet. According to
source at Atlanta weather, a balloon could only be seen with the naked eye
up to approximately 5000 feet, and if balloon had continued to rise at the
same rate it would have been out of sight when reported.
