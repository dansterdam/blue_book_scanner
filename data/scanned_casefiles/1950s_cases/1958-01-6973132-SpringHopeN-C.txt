The Morehead Planetarium, one of the six Zeiss planetariums in the western hemisphere, and the one on the University campus, is open for public shows every evening at 8:30, 1:00 and 8:30 on Saturday and 3:30 on Sunday. The program is changed frequently. There is always something new at the Morehead Planetarium. The Morehead Building contains, in addition to the Planetarium, the Gymnasium and other Academic facilities. Also, there are rooms devoted to temporary art exhibits. The 35-foot Copernican orrery, one of only two such installations in the world, is a particularly impressive mechanism.

Dear Sir,
Saturday night as I was traveling U.S. 64 I saw something which puzzled me. It was approximately 12:15 and I was about a mile east of Spring Hope, N.C., driving west, when I saw a green object. It seemed to be traveling straight toward the earth and appeared to be a meteor, except that it was very large and had a green color. The speed seemed to be about the same as a meteor, when it seemed to reach the earth, the object burst into a shower of sparks, illuminating the whole countryside. I could not help but think that it was very large compared to anything I have ever seen fall from the sky.
Several of my friends have also seen things similar to this. Friday night, January 10, my neighbor saw something which he described, and it was very similar to what I saw. Two more of my friends have seen green lights at different times. A friend from Rocky Mount saw something green Friday night, but it seemed to be a little different from the rest. As I said probably have a very simple explanation, and I would appreciate any light you could give me in finding out what caused these sights. Thank you very much.
