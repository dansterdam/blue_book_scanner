Dear Sir,

Saturday night as I was traveling U.S. 64 I saw something which puzzled me. It was approximately 12:15 and I was about 2 miles east of Spring Hope, traveling west, when I saw a green object. It seemed to be traveling straight toward the earth and reminded me of a meteor, except that it was very large and had a green color. The speed seemed to be about the same as a meteor, when it seemed to reach the earth, the horizon lighted up as if an explosion had occurred. I couldn't estimate the distance it was from me but it was very large compared to anything I have ever seen fall from the sky.

Several of my friends have also seen things similar to this. Friday night, January 16, my neighbor saw something which he described, and it was very similar to what I saw. Two more of my friends have seen green lights at different times. I tried from Rocky Mt. saw something green Friday night, but it seemed to be a little different from the rest. All these probably have a very simple explanation, and I would appreciate any help you could give me in finding out what caused these lights. Thank you very much.
