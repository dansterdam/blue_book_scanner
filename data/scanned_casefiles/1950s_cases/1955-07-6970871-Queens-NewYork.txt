INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY

1. Telephone calls to the 26th Air Division, Roslyn AFB, Roslyn, New York and to COS, EADF, Stewart AFB, Newburgh, New York, revealed that there was no unusual activity, balloon or searchlight activity in the New York metropolitan area at the time of the sighting.

2. After the interview with the SOURCE, these facts were known to the investigator:

(a) The objects moved in pairs from east to west and west to east, this pattern never changed during the sighting.

(b) The color was similar to that of a light bulb.

(c) Total duration of sighting covered approximately thirty minutes.

(d) The cloud conditions at the time consisted of overcast Nimbus and Cumulous clouds.

It was logical to assume that the sighting was caused by either of the following:

(1) The beams of two power searchlights illuminating one cloud layer, and reflecting on to another, thus giving the impression of four beams.

(2) The beams of four power searchlights operating within reasonable proximity of each other.

3. A possibility existed that there was a slight error in the SOURCE's estimate of azimuth of objects relative to true North. The investigator, at the time of the interview, noted that the SOURCE was somewhat vague as to the distance and exact location of the UFOB. Applying a creditable latitude of error to the azimuth of the sighting, the investigator explored the possibility that this (presumed) searchlight activity had originated in the Times Square area of New York City where movie premieres, sporting events, etc., are prevalent, particularly on Saturday nights, at which time the sighting had occurred.

4. A check with the 16th Police Precinct, located at 17th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues, New York City (ICON F HALL, C101), whose area of jurisdiction includes Times Square, revealed that there was no multiple searchlight activity in their area on the evening of the 30th of July. The officer, however, was kind enough to give the investigator the telephone number of Mr. _______, owner of the Publicity Searchlight Company. A phone call was put through to Mr. _______, who checked his files, and informed the investigator that only single searchlights were in operation on that particular evening, and these were all widely scattered throughout the city. Before hanging up, Mr. _______, remembered that an associate of his, Mr. _______, operated a battery of four searchlights quite frequently at the Palisades Amusement Park, Palisades Park, New Jersey. An appointment was made to visit Mr. _______ as a follow-up, which substantiated the investigators theory, certifying that his four searchlights were in operation at the time of the UFOB sighting. He also

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

Stated that a pattern as described by the SOURCE was very possible, and it was not unusual for his lights to be visible from the relatively short distance of approximately 10A miles.

5. It is the investigator's conviction, therefore, that these lights were the four spherical objects observed, notwithstanding slight miscalculations on the part of the SOURCE concerning distance and azimuth.

PART ONE: Description of sighting by Mr. [redacted], Rego Park, New York (GEORGE NJEL 0843)
PART TWO: Investigators Summary

II. SUMMARY: At 06/1930Z AUG 55, Det 3 was notified by Headquarters, 4602d AISS to conduct a follow-up investigation of a UFOB sighting in Rego Park, New York. (UFOB-F 1411) On 8/1930 Jul 55, SOURCE had immediately notified the New York Daily News who referred him to the Commander, 2230th ARFC, Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York. The Commander, 2230th ARFC forwarded the initial report through normal military channels. SOURCE estimated that the sighting, which consisted of four (4) spherical objects, was approximately five (5) miles north of his back-yard. Those objects moved in groups of two, one group moving east to west, and the others, most nearly in changing directions every twenty (20) seconds. The total time of sighting was approximately thirty (30) minutes. The sightings were also observed by the wife, and the landlady of the SOURCE, The landlady was not available at the time of the interview, and the wife was of little assistance, taking the role of a "yes-man" for all of her husband's statements. SOURCE was of the opinion that the four (4) spherical objects were not positively identified as such because there were no visible shafts of light supporting them. The probability of the fact that the sightings were beams of light was substantiated by a statement from Mr. Secretary-Treasurer of the Palisades Amusement Park Company, Palisades Park, New Jersey (See incl #5).

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a nervous, but cooperative young man who was performing what he considered his civic duty. He made no mention of the sighting to his neighbors, relatives or friends. The fact that he was not a publicity seeker was evidenced by his request, over the phone, that the investigator call at his home in civilian clothing in order to prevent any possible embarrassment to his and his wife. On the basis of the SOURCE's intelligence, education and sincerity at the time of the interview, it is the opinion of the investigator that the SOURCE be considered reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. SOURCE, together with his wife and landlady, was standing in the back-yard of his home in Rego Park, New York (GEORGE HILL 0843) at 31/0230x JUL 55.

2. SOURCE glanced up and observed four (4) spherical objects, grouped in pairs. The first pair moved east to west and the second pair in a nest to east direction every fifteen (15) or twenty (20) seconds.

3. The objects were observed for approximately thirty (30) minutes before disappearing. The sky was cloudy with no moon or stars visible. The temperature was relatively high.

4. SOURCE described the objects as being "the color of a light bulb" and that they reminded him of "spotlight beams, etc. & that there were no visible shafts of light supporting them." At all times the objects remained constant, neither being obstructed from view, nor fading from sight.

5. The objects were estimated by the SOURCE to be approximately five (5) miles from him in a NW direction (approximately 315°).

6. SOURCE stated that the objects were about the size of a pea held at arm's length.

7. SOURCE's opinion as to the cause of this phenomenon was that "it could have been a searchlight hitting overcast clouds and moving back and forth."

All four of my sixty inch power searchlights were operating on the evening of the 30th of July, between sunset and midnight. They are operated on separate electrical motor units of varying speeds, thus making possible an infinite number of combinations of various patterns.

It is not uncommon for these beams of lights to be visible for several miles.
