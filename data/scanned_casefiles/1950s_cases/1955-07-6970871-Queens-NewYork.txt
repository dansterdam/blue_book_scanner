INVESTIGATORS SUMMARY

Telephone report from the 26th Air Division, Melvin 1J. Healyn, New York and to OOGIPC LEAD, Lackland AFB, concerning a sighting in the metropolitan area at the time of the sighting.

After the interview with the SOURCE, these facts were known to the investigators:

(a) The objects moved in pairs from east to west and west to east; this pattern never changed during the sighting.
(b) The color was similar to that of a light bulb.
(c) Total duration of sighting covered approximately thirty minutes.
(d) The cloud conditions at the time consisted of overcast nimbus and cumulous clouds.

It was logical to assume that the sighting was caused by either
(1) The beams of two power searchlights illuminating one cloud layer, and reflecting on to another, thus giving the impression of four beams.
(2) The beams of four power searchlights operating within reasonable proximity of each other.

A possibility existed that there was a slight error in the SOURCE's estimate of a duration of sighting greater than 39 minutes. The investigators at the time of the interview, noted that the SOURCE was somewhat vague as to the distance and motion of the UFO's.

As a result of this investigation by the Air Technical Intelligence Center, it was concluded that this (presumed) searchlight activity had originated in the Times Square area of New York City where events on sporking events, etc. are prevalent, particularly on Saturday nights, at which time the sighting had occurred.

In a check with the 16th Police Precinct, located at 47th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenues (Roan No. 321, 0131), whose area of jurisdiction includes Times Square, revealed that there was no multiple searchlight activity in their precinct on the night of the 20th of July. The Police Captain in charge advised that the investigation wes carried out enough to have ascertained the accuracy of the information contained in this file, and therefore informed the investigator that only single searchlights were in operation at the time, and the SOURCE was widely scattered throughout the city before hanging up, Mr. Healyn remembered that an associate of his had access to a battery of four searchlights while working on a carnival type event, and that this equipment was made available to the promoters of some outdoor events, and that quite often these four searchlights were in operation at the time of the UFO sighting.

The text in the document states that a pattern was described by the source as very possible, and it was not unusual for it to be visible from the relatively short distance of approximately 100 miles. It also states that it is the investigator's conviction that these lights were the four spherical objects observed, indicating a misunderstanding on the part of the source concerning distance and azimuth.
The document is signed by John Vrana, Captain, USAF Charge.
The Approving Officer's comments state that the opinion of the Preparing Officer is that the sighting was caused by searchlight activity described in this report.

PART TWO: Investigators Summary
II. SUMMARY:
At 06/19302 AUG 55, Det 3 was notified by Headquarters, 4602d AISS to conduct a follow-up investigation in Page, New York (GROUP HJBL 0843) at 31/0230Z JUL 55. GUARDS had immediately notified the New York military channels, and this information was passed through normal channels. SOUCE estimated that the sighting, which consisted of four (4) spherical objects, was approximately 7000 (2130 meters) in size. These objects moved in groups of two, one group moving due west, and the other, east to west. The objects appeared to be at an extreme altitude and were observed for approximately 15 minutes. This sighting was corroborated by the wife, and the landladyof the Source. The landladywas not available at the time of the interview, taking the role of a "yeoman" for all other husbands' statements. SOURCE was of the opinion that the phenomenon could not have been aircraft, and was more likely characteristic of something supernatural. The probability of the fact that the sightings were indeed of light was questionable, and possibly substantiated by a statement from the Palisades Amusement Park Company, Palisades Park, New Jersey.

4. SOURCE DESCRIBED THE OBJECTS AS BEING "THE COLOR OF A LIGHT BULB" AND THAT THEY RESEMBLED HIS CONCEPTION THAT "THERE WERE NO VISIBLE SHAFTS OF LIGHT SUPPORTING THEM." AT ALL TIMES THE OBJECTS REMAINED CONSTANT NEITHER BEING OBSTRUCTED FROM VIEW NOR FADING FROM SIGHT.
5. THE OBJECTS WERE ESTIMATED BY THE SOURCE TO BE APPROXIMATELY FIVE (5) MILES FROM HIS LOCATION (APPROXIMATELY 3,15 MILES).
6. SOURCE STATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PEA HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH.

STATEMENT BY FOUR.

At approximately 10:30 we saw four (4) spherical objects. They were grouped in pairs, crossing each other as they moved west to east and east to west. These spheres changed course about every 15 or 20 seconds and after a half hour finally disappeared.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document labeled "STATEMENT" that describes observations of sixty-inch power searchlights operating on the evening of July 30th between sunset and midnight. The text indicates that the searchlights were operated on separate electrical motor units of varying speeds, and it was not uncommon for these beams of lights to be visible for several miles.

STATEMENT
All four of my sixty inch power searchlights were operating on the evening of the 30th of July, between sunset and midnight. They are operated on separate electrical motor units of varying speeds, thus making possible an infinite number of combinations of various patterns. It is not uncommon for these beams of lights to be visible for several miles.
