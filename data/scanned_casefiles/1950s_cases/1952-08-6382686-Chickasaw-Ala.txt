STATEMENT OF
CAPTAIN WILLIAM E. EDWARDS
AO 83 751

29 August 1952

The undersigned was on a tour of duty as Officer of the Day, Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama, from 0830, 28 August 1952 to 0330, 29 August 1952.

At approximately 2130, 28 August 1952, I received a telephone call from a Mr. [redacted] living in Chickasaw, Alabama. I alerted the Air Provost Marshal and the control tower operators, who in turn alerted the G.C.A. operators at Brookley Air Force Base.

I then proceeded to the tower to see if I could observe any objects in the area advised by Mr. [redacted], arriving in the tower at approximately 2150.

I was advised while in the tower, that the O.S.I. agents were alerted to check the accuracy of the report.

The tower operator asked me to check an object he had observed with the binoculars in the tower. This time was approximately 2150. Looking with both the naked eye and through the glasses, the object appeared slightly larger than a planet or bright star. This was at an approximately 280° angle and at a degree of elevation of 10° to 20° from the ground. This object remained stationary for approximately 20 minutes. I was called out and advised the tower operators to continue observation.

The G.C.A. advised the tower that they had a small distinct white blip in edge of the ground return at a distance of four (4) miles on a bearing of 280° from Brookley while I was observing the object. This blip was approximately the same relative bearing and distance as estimated by the undersigned.

[RESTRICTED SECURITY INFORMATION stamp at bottom]

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN WILLIAM E. EDWARDS, AO 838 751 (Continued)

The illumination varied and changed from bluish green to a red, nearly the color of exhaust flames and glowing red of exhaust stacks as noted by persons familiar with aircraft flying at night.

My first impression was an aircraft approaching, however, G.C.A. could not observe any aircraft within its scope or any movement.

At the time of observation there was some cloud cover and the undersigned could not observe the Bates Field beacon which is approximately 11 miles distant.

I went on duty at the GCA trailer at 1900, 28 August 1952, and was
to stay out there all night as a trailer guard radar operator. Sometime
past nine the tower called and asked me to scan to the North and on a
360 degree angle. I turned on the radar locator of the AN/TPN-1 set to
the North. There was nothing out there on the scope. I called the tower
back and asked them what it was all about. They said to go ahead to stand
watch on the 360 degree angle, that the Officer of the Day was up there,
and to report anything at all that I saw on the scope. A little bit
later I noticed a return, not of too definite a shape, at about four (4)
miles on a bearing of 280 degrees. It did not move. When I called the
tower and told them of this, they told me to continue watching it, which
I did. I watched it about half an hour. The rest of the team (GCA Team)
came out and we turned the new set, an AN/CPN-4, on to see if we could
see anything. Nothing was visible above or through the ground clutter
on the new set. As far as we could see, it did not move and did not
get any more definite. None of us are very familiar with the AN/CPN-4
scope and couldn't notice any difference. I discontinued watching about
0030, 29 August 1952.

STATEMENT OF

29 August 1952

At 2130 on the night of 28 August 1952, my wife went to the back door to let the dog screen. She called me and I went over to the door. In the South about sixty (60) degrees above the ground I saw the object. There were clouds but clear atmosphere. The object was a fire engine red, and twingled to a crystal blue as in a cut diamond. I didn't count them all but there were different ones. We were watching the brightest ones motions. It would weave back and forth and take a couple of hops and aimed. After two or three minutes it was much larger than a bright star or planet. We calculated it as between seven and ten miles away, almost directly over Brockley Field. If it were a plane you would hear some noise, but this did not make any noise. Later two smaller ones appeared almost together in the south southwest. Then we saw another large one. It was crystal blue and red and would rule out slowly then appear real bright. We watched this in a southwest direction that appeared just over a house top. It was gradually and slowly disappear. I was just as red as could be but it didn't have a constant motion. It would stay on red and then on sort of a bronze blue. It was within five minutes after the first one we had seen. After the second one disappeared I called the field and talked with the Officer of the Day and gave directions and distance from here. Then I went to bed and had been in bed only a minute when a car drove up to the front porch. It was Mr. _______ from the field. It was then about 2150. We went to the back porch and saw another of the bright objects. It was not as bright as the first two and appeared low over the house tops. Mr. _______ saw it before I pointed it out to him. It was standing still for a while then moved slowly to the right then disappeared.

The one Mr. Robinson saw was in the west. The first two that we saw were near little black clouds and stood out real bright. _______ (______) made a statement that it looked like it was shining through the clouds. He saw objects again after Mr. _______ left that looked almost like a comet or a star. I didn't tell the other things because of its flashing and it looked like an explosion. I went back on the porch and again saw these flashes then it just quit pretty soon.

I thought when I first saw them they were stars or planets, then I realized that stars didn't do like that. I have seen them off and on. The first time was on the evening of 5 July 1952, the day my wife and I moved into this house. I was going to call the field before, but they would disappear.

STATEMENT OF

29 August 1952

I was at home on the evening of 28 August. At approximately 9:30 PM, Mr. called me to the back door. He wanted me to see something in the sky. When I went outside, he was looking in a westerly direction. I noticed some strange objects moving off to the right in a straight line. We then spotted two more, and as I watched several passed. These objects appeared to jump from time to time. A white streak appeared and looked as though it was playing tricks. These objects were in sort of a formation. The only light I saw was at times 15 or 16 light points and at times shoot clear across the horizon. While I was talking to Mr. we came out from Brookley Field, I noticed one that was a reddish-like, like a bomb breaking. This was at approximately 9:50 PM. It looked like a ball of fire and I knew it was to bright to be a falling star or anything like that. They looked like a ball, one each point top. There was a red and blue light and at times looked like one above the other. At other times, like a figure eight with the top part smaller. However, I don't know about this. It looked like it might have been a star, and really strange.

Control Tower Operator

I was working in traffic answering calls when the Officer of the Day came around. Two boys and I went outside with the Officer of the Day where I saw a light to the West of the field. This was at about 2100. The light was in the vicinity of the rest of the stars. It was brighter then a star and was brighter then the stars in the same vicinity. It was a bright white color. I looked at it for just a little while, only about three or four minutes and then went back inside the building. I know nothing about radar, but at the same time we were in contact with GCA by radio. The GCA operator reported something on the radar scope, a blip. The GCA operator reported another one Southwest of the field, then reported three blips with 1-1/2 to 2000 feet, none moving and GCA not say anything about size or shape. The weather was pretty good, cloudy in parts. Clouds didn't shade or interfere with stars in the rear. It was clear in the area of the object, no clouds. I have no object whatever. The object was to the right of the moon. I never noticed if the object was below or above the moon. I have witnessed similar sightings in Alesia where we had reports like this for two or three, one every seventh night, and this object was exactly the same as the one there.

CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR

29 August 1952

On the night of 23 August 1952, I was on duty as a control tower operator when the Control Tower Officer at the Day area requested me to maintain observation for an unidentified aerial object. The Officer of the Day stated that he had a report from Chickasaw of a flying saucer in the area of the field. The Control Tower Officer and myself went out to the UHF shack directly behind the UF large and we started looking around. Sgt. Gelding, NCO in charge of the tower, and the Officer of the Day locally located an unidentified object in the sky, and I observed a red-ish green light in the sky.

At this time the GCA operator reported that he had a blip on his scope at about a 230° angle from the station at approximately 4,000 feet. The GCA picked up another object on the scope at a 240° angle. The object was on the radar screen and below the moon. The Officer of the Day requested aircraft coverage at this point. The only aircraft taking off was an Air Force B-29, 5594 going to Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. The aircraft Commander was notified, and he would take a look, however, he failed to contact the tower afterwards. The object was stationary then moved back and forth on a horizontal line, then disappeared. I was recalled at 2315. I could not estimate the size of the object nor give any other details except the remarks concerning color.

29 August 1952

STATEMENT OF: [redacted], [redacted], Mobile, Alabama

Last night at approximately 2200 hours, I saw four objects in the sky ranging from two south to southeast from Chickasaw, Alabama. Two of these objects did not move yet were slightly larger and brighter than stars or planets. One of these objects appeared in the form of two blurred lights, one above the other, the top light being green and the bottom light zlony red; these red and green lights flashed on and off as if controlled by a neon sign blinker. The fourth object was alternately fiery red and blue-green in color and seemed to blink at regular intervals. This fourth object remained stationary for about fifteen minutes and then slowly drifted fifteen or twenty degrees and became stationary again. I left Chickasaw, Alabama, for Brookley Air Force Base at approximately 2220 and these objects were still in the sky upon my departure from Chickasaw. I estimate the distance from Chickasaw, Alabama, to the nearest object as eight miles and the farthest object as twelve miles. When I arrived at Brookley Air Force Base I stopped to locate these objects and was unable to locate them. I heard no noise nor saw any exhaust from any of the above objects. From the distance of my observation of these objects I found it difficult to obtain further identifying characteristics.

STATEMENT OF: Mrs [redacted] Base and Transient Aircraft Section

At approximately 2130, 28 August 1952, while riding west on Duvall Street between Houston Street and Michigan Avenue, I saw two lighted objects. At first they failed to attract too much of my attention because they appeared to be perhaps large lights on tip end of a large type aircraft. The objects were stationary, an 11:30 do appear on an aircraft proceeding in same direction I was traveling. However, the lights appeared larger than those ordinarily used on wing tips. For approximately two minutes I looked steadily at the objects until they moved in an arc, north and down. Then they disappeared from view. The appearance was as a light only. I noticed no coloring. They did appear rather oval with the flat side together, but not close. When the objects moved they moved simultaneously. I did not see any exhaust or hear any noise that could have come from these strange objects.

STATEMENT OF
A/2C EDWARD O. SMITH
CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR

29 August 1952

I was on duty on the night of 28 August 1952, as a control tower operator, when an unusal object was sighted by CCA operation. As soon as we were called we started looking in the north and west with end without field glasses. I saw an object in the northwest. The object was red in appearance. Through the binoculars I was using. The object then moved south to southeast. I didn't see it move. First it appeared in one place then in the other. Then it faded out, getting dimmer and dimmer. The object moved toward the east. Apparently to try to maneuver. The object was brighter than a star. It did not begin to fade until it had moved from the west to the southwest. At first it seemed to be coming toward us, then seemed to move away. We could see it just a little with the naked eye, then it faded out completely.

STATEMENT OF

29 August 1952

As approximately 9:30 on the night of 28 August, I went to latch our back screen door and looked out across the house tops and then I saw a big light. I called my husband out to see what it was, and at the same time he called Mr. to see what it was. We watched it a few minutes and then it disappeared. The object over the house was pretty low and larger than a star and in another method, it drifted from south to west and it just drifted out of sight. Another object was lighter in its south which disappeared also.

We saw two to three objects. They were dim and I really couldn't tell the height because I don't have any idea. The first object was bright and the other four were this far. As this time Mr. arrived from Brody Field and saw the second object. It blinked red and blue during the time Mr. Robinson was there. The object that was close was soon then in transit to van those. It was and then came out completely. The first object was what I would say of a medium height. The second object was higher in the sky. There were clouds in the sky but they did not hinder observation of the objects. There were also a few stars in the sky at the time we were observing the objects. The first object would move swiftly, then stop and move again, then went out of sight. We observed this object for about five minutes.

I knew this object was not a star because it blinked, it would be red then change to blue in color and then it would completely vanish to return to sight again. It did not move away but would black out and return in sight again. The two objects that I observed in a relatively close position, one was beneath the other with the one below moving toward the top one which soon vanished and was gone.

The object, to my mind, was real small, something like a star but still red and blue, and you could tell it was moving because it soon moved to the other object. It was about 9:30 when we saw the first object which lasted about five (5) minutes or a little longer. My husband and I have seen these objects before but never notified anyone.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Intelligence Officer
Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama

Details: Six unidentified aerial objects were sighted near Brookley Air Force Base on the night of 28 August 1952 between the hours of 2130 and 2245 Central. Witnesses were scattered over the horizon, two being large and four small. Color emitted by objects was white. No noise was heard which would be identifiable as an engine noise. No characteristic of being able to remain stationary was noted. Objects had a definite characteristic of being able to remain noiseless in place and had a peculiar hovering motion. All witnesses stated that they had never seen anything like it previously. Witnesses observed the objects from two levels, then descended vertically to tree top level, where it hovered and the ascended vertically away from the observers. The remaining three smaller objects and the two larger objects disappeared when their lights were suddenly extinguished as with a switch.

One of the smaller objects was observed through binoculars and the GCA Radar picked up an unidentified object showing as a blip in the outer edge of the ground return. Object was not identified on Radar Scope as an Air Craft.

The location of the observers was 30 degrees, 45 minutes, 30 seconds north; 85 degrees, 04 minutes, 30 seconds west; Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama. The observers placed in the first set of coordinates was the object in the south west quadrant at a range of seven to ten miles, with an elevation of up to 45 degrees. Observers listed in the second set of coordinates observed the object at the first sighting on a bearing of 280 degrees, with a range of four miles from GCA site at Brookley Air Force Base, with an elevation of up to 20 degrees.

The weather report for the period is as follows: six tenths strata cumulus cloud 1200, two winds from 50 degrees, ten knots at 2130 central; 2230 observation was the same cloud conditions as above with wind from 135 degrees, 14 knots.

These objects were not identified or observed by any aircraft flying in the local area.

Captain William E. Edwards, AO-830751, 1703 Air Transport Group was on duty as Base Officer of the Day on night of 28 August 1952 (a statement is attached). He stated that as the result of a telephone call from Mr. [redacted] of Chickasaw, Alabama reporting to him the unusual objects, he began investigating the matter. As set forth in his statement Capt Edwards reported that he observed the object reported by Mr. [redacted].

In an interview with Capt Edwards he remarked that he had never seen anything like it before. Capt Edwards is an experienced airman and pilot.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Top portion of header contains some blacked out/illegible text]

Intelligence Officer
Specially Air Force Base, Alabama

They were about eight miles from him. He remarked that he was unable to distinguish any real identifying marks because of the distance. He corroborates the testimony of other witnesses in the twilight life flashing of the lights. He verified the fact that the objects were of first stationary and flying at it through stationary again. He did not observe them to disappear.

A/3C Edward O. Smith, 1919 AACS Squadron, (Statement attached), was on duty in the control tower on night of 28 August 1952. He observed an object in the northwest, through binoculars. He stated that it was red in color, moving in zig zag maneuvers, spinning briefly then moving, generally heading.

A2/C Irl A. Whittaker, AF-14625045, 1919 AACS Squadron (Statement attached) noticed a reddish green object is his watch. He was on duty as Officer of the Day. He was on duty on the night of 28 August 1952. A2/C Whittaker stated that he could only describe the lighting but could not estimate the size or shape.

5/Sgt Robert B. Calkins, AF-19323077, 1910 AACS Squadron, (Statement attached), was on duty on the night of 28 August 1952. He observed a light in the sky, but apparently paid little attention to it. He remarked that he had had similar reports when stationed in Alaska and had seen similar lighting. He did not attach any significance to the lights and apparently is convinced that it is similar to a phenomenon observed in Alaska.

A2/C Charles E. Goetz, AF-11231532, 1919 AACS Squadron, (Statement attached), was also on duty on the night of 28 August 1952. He was asked to scan the north by the control tower, sometime after nine. After a light he reported a return on a bearing of 220 degrees and that it did not move. The shape was not so definite and he watched it for some time. He made a few crew came out to turn on a larger set and did not pick up anything above ground clutter.

Mr. and Mrs. [blacked out] of [blacked out] (Chickasaw, Alabama) both report (statements attached) seeing some unusual lights in the sky on the night of 28 August 1952. They claim to have seen similar objects before. The lights were unusual and larger than that given by a star. The light was described as similar to the given off by a diamond. No noise or engine sound was heard. The lights did persist. The lights did diminish on one of the objects if flashed, and on one it was stationary. The coloring changed from red to blue. Mr. [blacked out] remarked that it appeared like an explosion.

Mr. [blacked out] also of Chickasaw, Alabama reported that on the night of 28 August 1952 he also saw an unusual light in the sky (Statement attached). He reports an object looking like two balls of fire in ray of light on top. He again reports the red and blue lights.

In summary it appears that witnesses have seen six objects on the night of 28 August 1952. One of them picked up by the radar. The light on the objects was brilliant changing from red to blue. Flying characteristics are described as remaining motionless, drifting, hovering, or changing. The observer reports a vertical descent and ascent. A map is attached showing general locality of the observers and the unusual flying objects.
