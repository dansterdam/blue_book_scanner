Dear Captain:

I now have had a chance to look through all the reports you sent, and the one concerning the "satellite-type sighting" Denver interests me very much. I am giving it the full treatment. It is clear that this could not have been any of the American satellites, not only because of the excessive brightness, but because no American satellite as near orbital scale has been approaching from the northwest at the latitude of Denver, on April 30th there were no known Russian Sputniks up, but even had there been it is almost inconceivable that objects that might would escape detection by our Moonwatch teams. This is a corker; so much so, that I wish I had the time and the opportunity to talk with these two officers. It could be that in casual conversation some clue might be obtained which is not apparent in their report.

I had an experience the other night which may bear on this. I had been instructing my young daughter in figuring sidereal time, and we had gone out to the lawn to check our calculations when there can along a sputnik-like object--a correct brightness, correct speed, correct color, and I almost stood aghast. There was no sound. A few minutes later another such object came through in another direction, and when a few minutes still another. On the third one I was able to detect over another such object near jet motors. Lights were not blinking. If the other object had not gone through I might honestly be puzzled to this day as to whether I had seen an unknown satellite. I didn't know that jets ever carried such lights.

It is almost inconceivable two such experienced officers could have made the mistake I had first made, but strange things do happen. In the meantime, I am having this observation checked against all other "unknown sputniks" that our teams from time to time have reported.

As to the other cases, which I am returning (I will return the Denver case very soon), we certainly seem to have a fine batch of meteor observations--five of them. Two others remain: one the object that was seen the same time on two nights just before sunrise.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(period of morning twilight had already begun). Vega was, as you say, near the point of sighting but it seems to me that it was somewhat higher than 60°. There was of course a very fine penetrating object in the sky at that time particularly, in the southeastern sky. The planet Venus was at its brightest in the pre-sunrise sky, and I know from past experience how easily it can be mistaken for an unknown object. My only reason - to question the stated position and to consider the possibility that it was Venus.

The case of the "daylight meteor" is greatly ambiguous. While a daylight fireball cannot be ruled out, I would myself favor the accidental release of some object from an aircraft. However, much hinges on the statement "orange flame". If it really was flaming then it looks as though we must credit this to a daylight meteor. If the light was simply a bright reflection of sunlight, then we have the other possibility. In either case, there is nothing hostile, and I say to this "insufficient information to be able to distinguish between daylight meteor or object falling from aircraft". I don't think it is worthwhile to pursue this one, although I think if I could talk to the chap a better analysis might have been made. If just occurs to me that perhaps the object might have been a burst weather or cosmic ray balloon, with the reflection from the trailing material according for the "tail four times the diameter of object". In fact, I think this is a distinct possibility since it coincides with the details of the main airport from which, I suppose, balloons are launched. The time of observation was 4:00 p.m., their time which, I believe, is about the time of such launchings. So, three possibilities, daylight meteor - part of aircraft - bursted balloon. All harmless but, I now tend to prefer the latter.

I am looking forward to visiting you in your new quarters----

Cheers,

J. Allen Hynek
