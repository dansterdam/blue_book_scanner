PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

1. Report of sighting an unidentified flying object submitted by 1st Lt. ________

2. 1st Lt. ________ reported seeing three, then soon after a total of four spheroidal
shaped objects. The object on the right was white, the middle was dark red, the
other two seemed to flash different colors, they being red, blue and white. They
appeared to be round and no exhaust from these objects was seen.

3. The objects were first seen at approximately 2310 hours, 7 March 1954, by Lt
________, who was at the time of sighting, the Duty Officer at Arlington Farms, a
station located near Arlington Cemetery. He was looking through a window at the
time of sighting, seeing three moving objects on a horizontal plane at an angle
of elevation from 15° to 20°. The objects appeared to be orbiting in the area,
and would intermittently climb and descend. Three of the objects seemed to
emanate from view, but one did drop below the horizon. They all were viewed
going in a southwesterly direction, and were seen for approximately one hour and
forty minutes. They appeared to be as far away as the stars themselves.

4. The manner of observation was ground to air, and visual.

5. The location of observers was at Arlington Hall, which is located on Globe and
Arlington Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia.

6. Identifying information of the observers is as follows:
1st Lt. _________, USAF, age 23, 6696th AFSS, Suitland Hall, Maryland.
Capt. __________, Army, Arlington Hall, Virginia. Reliability unknown.
1st __________, Army, Intelligence Service. Reliability unknown.

7. Weather conditions at the time of sighting were described by Lt Boyle as
follows: 15 miles, no clouds, temperature 45°, dew point 31, and wind 6 knots.

8. There was some air traffic in the vicinity, but it was sparse.

9. Upon investigation by 1st Lt. _________, USAF, Intelligence
Division, Capt. _________, USAF, Intelligence Officer, carefully checked with
Washington National Bank and drew a rough sketch of any unusual contact with unidentified objects. He also
stated that the objects looked like nothing he had ever seen before and could not be
then carefully to keep so certain of their own belief. In checking on the flying objects,
the investigator's office contacted the Naval CB research and there met with
Dr. Osserman, an astronomer employed there. He offered the following explanation.
Individually, with the same sort of equipment that the objects were seen, he
could see a setting star, which would be to the west, and possibly explain the
changing colors. Dr. Osserman said one could also observe a setting star, which would
explain some of the objects' behavior. He further stated that the Naval research
understands by visual means, could also explain the other objects disappearing from
view. He said that he was quite certain that the objects seen for such a long period
as he has observed into such sightings on previous occasions. In view of this
information, the investigator feels that an astronomical explanation was
was sufficient to explain the unidentified flying objects, as no definite
information can be obtained to believe otherwise.
