Swenson Report Tells of Saucer Sighted, Chased
Recent revival of interest by the public in reports on flying saucers has induced a Norcarlier to relate an adventure along these lines which he had kept to himself in fear that nobody would believe the tale.

According to Swenson, when the object was first sighted, it appeared to have the same characteristics as adjacent stars, except that it was surrounded by a greenish oval halo which had the appearance of cigar smoke around the outside of a luminous core.

He stopped his car and observed the object for thirty minutes. At first it appeared to be 4000 to 5000 feet in the air.

As he watched, the object dilated rapidly up to five times its original magnitude and remained that way for half a minute.

The Chase
It then dwindled back to a slightly lesser size than the nearest comparative star (Vega), and had the appearance of being cut in half. Later it returned to its original density and magnitude.

Swenson drove eastward on Center Street in the general direction of the object in an attempt to see it at closer range. The object moved off in an easterly direction at a slow rate of speed and although he was able to approach somewhat closer, the street turned south after five miles and the chase came to an end.

He stopped his car and was able to observe the flight pattern of the object against a cloud formation until it disappeared. It appeared to climb and gain speed.

The action of the object as it moved up and eastward was like a rubber ball bouncing in slow motion. The object rose and fell vertically but did not swerve from side to side.

Swenson's background includes a tour of duty with the USAF Intelligence Department, Historical Section. His assigned duty was to compile and illustrate war events; results of experimental projects, and combat developments. He was educated at University of Utah; Harvard University; and Cincinnati Art Institute, Los Angeles.

Swenson's report is reminiscent, to a memo written in April, 1950, by Northrop pilot Max Stanley who came to very close range in broad daylight with an object while flying over Memphis, Texas, with two other men in the Northrop "Black Widow."

"The object," Stanley stated, "was of a silvery metallic color with a translucent quality; no orange ring or other evidence of color was observed. The shape of the object was spherical with prominent detents on the top and bottom, and with a dark streak or shadow connecting these detents. For the most part this shadow was vertical and appeared to tilt occasionally, resulting in a sideways movement of the object."

Stanley's memo states, "Mr. Lloyd Balsan, who was riding in the gunner's station in the airplane, is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Sam F. West is a graduate of the University of California, and for five years was employed in the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

"Both of the above observers are familiar with this report, and are in agreement with the statements made herein. Further, we all agree that the object sighted was not an airplane, balloon, celestial body, or any other object commonly seen above the earth."

FLYING SAUCER viewed by Leo Swenson, Illustration Department, in early morning of November 28, 1951, pictured here in sketch made at the scene by Swenson especially for Northrop News. Chart shows size as compared to Vega when first seen (1); when it expanded (2); when it shrank and appeared cut in half at its nucleus (3); and when it returned to its original size (4). Arrows (center left) show path and action of object as it departed in easterly direction. Swenson had the object in direct view for over thirty minutes. He was watching stars and going over a course in navigation he is taking in a local school when he spotted the odd object. Passenger airplane (right center) gave Swenson a fair idea of height and size of the "saucer." Object was chased in Swenson's automobile for a good five miles.
