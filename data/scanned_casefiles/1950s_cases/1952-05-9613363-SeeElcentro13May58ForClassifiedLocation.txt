stated that upon [redacted] discharge, he left Imperial and the Chief had no record
as to [redacted] present whereabouts.

5. CDR [redacted], Operations Officer, Naval Air Station, El Centro, 
Calif., was interviewed and made available the official Navy Log covering the hours 
of said sightings. CDR [redacted] stated with the concurrence of the 
control tower operator reporting the sightings, none of the aircraft aloft could 
observe any of the reported objects in the sky. CDR [redacted] stated that upon 
checking with the control tower after report of said sighting, he found the control 
tower operator was viewing the morning star through a set of binoculars and that 
at that particular hour of the morning, the morning star gives off a pulsating light 
that when viewed through a set of binoculars appears to be red, yellow, orange 
and green and the pulsating effect has a tendency to appear that the star is moving.
CDR [redacted] stated that the Yuma Tower after listening to the conversation on the 
drop wire, said drop wire being an inter-tower communication, reported that a 
strange object in about the same position had been sighted. CDR [redacted] stated 
that he had no knowledge as to what the Yuma Tower Operator was viewing, but from 
the position given, stated that he was personally satisfied that the Yuma Tower 
was also viewing the morning star.

6. Lt. (SG) [redacted], Air Officer of the Day, Naval Air Station, El 
Centro, California, was on duty as Air Officer of the Day 15 May 1952, and also 
checked the Control Tower Operator's sighting, and stated that it was the morning 
star. Lt. [redacted] stated that there were numerous aircraft up on early morning flights 
at this time, and upon notification, all pilots were alerted to observe for aerial 
phenomena. All reported negative.

7. Mr. [redacted], CAA Office, MAS, El Centro, Calif. MAS, El Centro, Calif., was interviewed 
in lieu of Mr. [redacted], CAA, El Centro, Calif. MAS, and stated that they were unable 
to confirm reports of unidentified objects over El Centro, Calif., on 15 May 1952.
The only records in reference to the above report were copies of the El Centro, 
Calif. Sheriff's Office message incorporated in this report. Mr. [redacted] stated 
that contact was made with the 761st AGBW Squadron, Mount Laguna, Calif., with 
negative results. Mr. [redacted] stated that the Yuma Tower had reported on the drop 
line the sighting of a mysterious object in the eastern sky, and after a check 
by CDR [redacted] and Lt. [redacted] of the Operations Office, MAS, El Centro, 
Calif., the officers reported that their tower operator was viewing the morning 
star through his binoculars, and it was their opinion that the Yuma Tower was also 
sighting the same object. Mr. [redacted] stated that no further investigation was 
made by CAA.

A. Text of Telephone Conversation Received by this Hq. 13 May 1952.

    At 1152Z, "Conform" (751st ACGW Sqdn, Mt. Laguna, Calif) called and said "Panto-
mima" (GMA) had received reports of five (5) "flying saucers" in the El Centro, Calif.
Area. Several minutes later a scope operator at "Conform" reported a long streak SE
of El Centro which lasted for two (2) sweeps of the antenna.

    The following information was received from March Air Force Base Flight Service
and was contained in a report sent to ADCs:

    Hovering over El Centro, five (5) "flying saucers" as large as B-36's with a light
underneath disappeared to the Southwest at a terrific rate of speed. -El Centro weather
at 0315P was clear, 15 miles visibility. They were reported at 13/1152 by El
Centro Sheriff's office.

    At 13/1115A an F9F pilot taking off from El Centro Naval Air Station reported what
appeared to be a shooting star driving at an angle of 60°. At 1142Z a sheriff's car at
Nilnad, California sighted a strange object resembling a parachute flare over the
South end of the Salton Sea. At 1150Z, a control tower operator at Yuma sighted an
orange and blue object 320° and 20 miles from his position. Hovering in one position
it changed to another position and began hovering again. Operator at El Centro NAS had
for too long a period to be a falling star. From 1200Z to 1230Z El Centro NAS had a
flight of four (4) F9F's airborne on a local flight.

    We had no fighters airborne at the time and did not scramble any.

EVALUATION OF ABOVE: C-5

4. Interrogation of [redacted] Tower Operator, Yuma, Municipal Airport, Yuma, Arizona, at 1135 hours, 20 May 1952.

Upon being interrogated, [redacted] stated that he had observed the same phenomena on several occasions following the first sighting on 13 May 52. It always occurred at a position approximately 320° from the control tower, and at a distance which he estimated at being approximately 10 to 15 miles. Consequently, he was convinced that the "object" was caused by the reflection of headlights on the highway at night at that position. This was confirmed by S/Sgt Porter, Tower Chief. Subject airmen were advised to continue observation, and inform this headquarters of activities observed.

EVALUATION OF ABOVE: B-3

5. Interrogation of Mr. Jensen, CAA, El Centro Municipal Airport, El Centro, California, at 0910 hours, 22 May 1952.

The CAA office, El Centro Municipal Airport, was visited in an attempt to contact Mr. Layton, CAA, who had been on duty on 13 May 52 at the time the object was sighted. Mr. Layton was not there. However, Mr. Jensen furnished the report filed by Layton on the incident. This report substantiated the information in the original report received this headquarters, and the report on file in the El Centro, California Sheriff's Office (See "B"). As Mr. Layton did not see the object himself, no further effort was made to contact him.

COMMENT OF D/I:

It is quite possible that an aircraft of the USAF, a B-47, may have been observed casting or being the aircraft in various maneuvers. On close tight formation of lights referred to could very easily be extant of the jet pods when the attitude of a B-47 was in just the right angular position. However, from the foregoing interrogations it is evident that a definite weakness exists in the civil defense program. In no uncomventional aircraft's known to have either the initiative or the know how to contact the concerned military activities when unconventional aircraft are sighted.

APPENDIX V
El Centro, Calif. Area - 13 May 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
In the El Centro, Calif., Area on 13 May 1952 four separate reports of unidentified aerial objects were made. They were as follows:

a. 1152 - Hovering over El Centro, five "flying saucers" as large as B-36's, with a light underneath, disappeared to the southwest at a terrific rate of speed. They were reported by the El Centro Sheriff's Office.

b. 1152 - An F9F pilot taking off from El Centro Naval Air Station reported what appeared to be a shooting star diving at an angle of 60°.

c. 1142Z - A sheriff's car at Weiland, Calif., sighted a strange object resembling a parachute flare over the south end of the Salton Sea.

d. 1150Z - A control tower operator at Yuma, Arizona, sighted an orange and blue object 320° and 20 miles from his position. After hovering for a short time in one position, it changed to another position and began hovering again. Operator said it was sighted for too long a period to be a falling star.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
There were no AF fighters airborne at the time but four F9F's from El Centro Naval Air Station were airborne from 1100Z to 1230Z.

III. CONCLUSIONS
a. It is possible that the F9F's and what appeared to be a shooting star account for the first report.

b. What appeared to be a shooting star was probably a meteor.

c. No conclusions.

d. The tower operator stated that he had observed the same phenomenon several times previously and is convinced that it is merely the reflection of automobile headlights on the highway at night.
