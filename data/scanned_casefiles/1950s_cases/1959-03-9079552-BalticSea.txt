Here is the text from the document:

(DESCRIPTION CONT.)

The light did not seem to move and it was impossible to say from where it came or how it came to its position in the sky. After a short while the "fire-ball" exploded creating a bright yellow-red cluster. From position given, the "fire-ball" appeared in the main direction of CRANZ, 30 KM north of Kaliningrad.

At the top and bottom of the page, the document is marked "UNCLASSIFIED".
