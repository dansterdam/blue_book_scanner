The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an informational page about aeronautical chart supply and military chart supply. The text in the document is as follows:

AERONAUTICAL CHART SUPPLY
To insure that the airman has the latest information available, U.S. & World Aeronautical Charts are revised at frequent periods, the Air Force Air Aeronautical Charts are revised semiannually, and other aeronautical charts on a more frequent schedule. The time of the next revision is indicated on the face of the charts.
Chart users are advised to check the list Dates of Latest Prints on display with authorized agents.

CIVIL CHART SUPPLY
Authorized agents for the sale of aeronautical charts have been appointed at certain airports and principal cities throughout the United States. The charts may also be obtained from the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington 25, D. C.

MILITARY CHART SUPPLY
Aeronautical charts, maps and publications which the USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service are indexed or listed in the current edition of the USAF "Catalog of Aeronautical Charts and Related Publications".

1. Aeronautical charts, maps and publications which the USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service are indexed or listed in the current edition of the USAF "Catalog of Aeronautical Charts and Related Publications":

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an aeronautical chart supply document that provides instructions and information about ordering and using various aeronautical charts and related materials.

AERONAUTICAL CHART SUPPLY

To insure that the airman has the latest information available, U.S. World Aeronautical Charts are revised at six months interval and other Aeronautical Charts are revised at specified periods. The prices of the most subscribed charts are shown below.

CIVIL CHART SUPPLY
Authorized agents for the sale of aeronautical charts have been appointed at certain airports and principal cities throughout the United States. The charts may also be obtained from the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington 25, D.C. 

MILITARY CHART SUPPLY
Aeronautical charts, maps and publications distributed by the USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service, including controlled or limited to the current edition of the USAF.

1. Requisitioning:
(1) Include Continental United States: 
(a) For reorder of charts, requisitions will be submitted to the supply channels designated by the Theater Commander for maintenance and distribution of aeronautical charts and maps.
(b) The supply facilities for Continental United States activities are the USAF Air Force Logistics Command Supply System Depot, 900 Ogden Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78226. 
(c) Supply outside Continental United States: Requisitions from USAF activities within the Continental United States will be submitted to the Distribution Division, USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service, St. Louis 14, Mo. Except when emanating from an Air Force, Wing, or Command Headquarters where requisitions are forwarded by inter-command channels to the Distribution Division.
(2) Within the Continental United States: Requisitions from USAF activities within the Continental United States are to be submitted to the Distribution Division, USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service, St. Louis 14, Mo.

2. Requirements for "Special Purpose Maps and Charts."
Maps and charts for special purposes, specific missions, and also those made and charts published by other government agencies, which are not listed in the Aeronautical Chart Catalog, will be obtained through the USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service, Washington 25, D.C. Charts will be furnished, if available, when specifically identified in requisitions.

3. Disposition of Charts.
Obsolete, damaged or mutilated aeronautical charts and maps may be destroyed. Disposition by salvage or destruction is to be in accordance with existing regulations. New editions of charts available are announced in the USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service Bulletin published semiannually.

CORRECTION INSTRUCTIONS
The Coast and Geodetic Survey is making an effort to furnish the user with a corrected chart. In this effort by making minor corrections to the chart in the field, the user must cooperate. 
Remarks: 
a. Mark all corrections on face of chart or under "Remarks" below.
b. Fold chart along regular fold lines, but with heads out.
c. Place chart in any U.S. mail box. Postage is not required.

The image does not contain any photograph, but rather an "AERONAUTICAL CHART SUPPLY" document with detailed information about civil chart supply, aeronautical chart requirements, and correction instructions. As an OCR system, I will now provide the full text found in the document:

AERONAUTICAL CHART SUPPLY

To insure that the airman has the latest information available, C-& W. World Aeronautical Charts are revised at six-month periods and the Alaskan World Aeronautical Charts are revised at twelve-month periods. The time for the next scheduled revision periods are shown on the faces of the respective aeronautical information.

CIVIL CHART SUPPLY

Authorized agents for the sale of aeronautical charts have been appointed at certain airports and principal cities through out the United States. The charts may also be obtained from the Director, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington 25, D. C.

1. Aeronautical charts, maps and publications distributed by the USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service are listed in the current edition of the USAF "Listing of Aeronautical Charts and Related Publications."
2. Requisitioning. 
a. Outside Continental United States: Requisitions are submitted through the supply channels designated by the Department of the Air Force.
(1) The user supply facilities are to submit requisitions for replenishment of stocks of aeronautical charts and maps prescribed by USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service.
b. Within Continental United States: Requisitions from USAF activities within Continental United States are to be submitted to the Commanding General, Air Materiel Command, Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, or as otherwise directed.
c. Requirements for special purpose maps and charts, other than those prescribed by USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service, are to bear the signature approval by endorsement of the Base or Station Operations Officer. Quantities of charts and maps requested are to be such as to ensure that stocks on hand at all times are not in excess.
3. Requirements for Special Purpose Maps and Charts.
a. Maps and charts for specialized purposes, and also those maps and charts published by other government agencies, which are not listed in the principal types of aeronautical charts in the current edition of the USAF "Listing of Aeronautical Charts and Related Publications," will be requisitioned from the appropriate agency as identified in regulations as to name or number, scale, projection and publisher.
b. Information regarding such procurement of certain aeronautical charts and maps may be obtained from the Director, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington 25, D. C.
4. Obsolete Charts.
Aeronautical charts rendered obsolete for air by a new edition, when not practicable to convert for con formity with new edition, are to be salvaged if feasible, or destroyed. Disposition by salvage or destruction is to be made in accordance with provisions of AFR 200-5.

CORRECTION INSTRUCTIONS

1. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is making every effort to furnish the user with accurate charts. The user will materially assist in this effort by promptly reporting corrections or amendments, omissions, deficiencies, relief and cultural features (roads, canals, power lines, etc.) on the face of the chart, on an overlay of the area, or under "Remarks" below. In reporting corrections, state whether in manuscript or printed notation.
a. Fold charts along regular fold lines, but with back out.
b. Make an extra fold along dotted line and staple at points as marked.

Remarks:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
1. LOCATION: Lake Charles, Louisiana
2. DATE OF INFORMATION: 20 September 1953
3. REPORT NO: F-2
4. SUBJECT: UNCLASSIFIED
5. SUMMARY: Witnesses reported that they observed two unidentified objects in the sky on the night of 20 September 1953, approximately 2100 hours. The objects were described as basketball-shaped and bluish in color. They were observed for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from view. No optical or electronic devices were used to observe the objects. The location, altitude, and distance of the objects with respect to the observers are unknown. The report indicates that the witnesses were reliable and had prior experience with aircraft observations. The weather was clear at the time of the sighting. No other corroborating or additional information is provided.
