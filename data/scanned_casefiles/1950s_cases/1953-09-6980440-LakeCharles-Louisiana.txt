AERONAUTICAL CHART SUPPLY

To insure that the airman has the latest information available, U.S. World Aeronautical Charts are revised at six-month periods and the Air-man World Aeronautical Charts are revised at twelve-month periods. The time of the next scheduled printing is shown on the face of the chart below the date of the aeronautical information.
Chart users are advised to check the list Dates of Latest Prints on display with authorized agents.

CIVIL CHART SUPPLY
Authorized agents for the sale of aeronautical charts have been appointed at certain airports and principal cities throughout the United States. The charts may also be obtained from the Director, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington 25, D. C.

MILITARY CHART SUPPLY
(Ref. AF Reg. 67-5)

1. Aeronautical charts, maps and publications distributed by the USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service are indexed or listed in the current edition of the USAF "Catalog of Aeronautical Charts and Related Publications."

2. Requisitioning.
a. Outside Continental United States:
(1) USAF activities are to submit requisitions thru the supply channels designated by the Theater Commander for maintenance and distribution of aeronautical charts and maps.
(2) Theater supply facilities are to submit requisitions for replenishment of stocks of aeronautical charts and maps thru channels to USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service, Washington 25, D. C.

b. Within Continental United States: Requisitions from USAF activities within Continental United States are to be submitted to Commanding Officer, Aeronautical Chart Plant, Ats: Distribution Division, 2nd and Arsenal Sts., St. Louis 18, Mo.

    Aerodynamic features: None
    Trail of exhaust: No exhaust and smoke
    Propulsion system: Unknown
    Speed: Fast
    Sound: None
    Maneuvers: Back and forth and in circles
    Manner of disappearance: As if electric light turned out

(2) Other pertinent information: Features: None
    Time of sighting: Approximately 2100 hours, 23 September 1953
    Length of time observed: 8 hours
    Manner of sighting: Visual, No optical or electronic equipment used
    Location of observer during sighting: Approximately 300 14' N, 93° 10' W
    Location of object with respect to observer: To NE, altitude and distance unknown

(5) Identifying Information of Observer: Not stated
    Location: Lake Charles, Louisiana. Estimate of reliability and experience: Not stated
