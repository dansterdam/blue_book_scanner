II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was completely thorough in his description of the sightings. SOURCE was extremely cooperative and was of superior intelligence.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE and his wife were on duty at the GOC post, Fairchild Field, Graham, North Carolina (GIG 3505), when the object was first sighted at 0501LZ March 1956, it was at an azimuth of 175° and an elevation of 3-5°. SOURCE was certain he observed the object for a total of ten minutes. It was pointed out to him another observer. In observed it with the naked eye, with eyeglasses, without eyeglasses through 7x50 binoculars and with eyeglasses through 7x50 binoculars. After watching it for approximately five minutes SOURCE GOC post approximately ten miles south. There they again observed it, but on this occasion no binoculars were available.

SOURCE stated there was neither daylight nor moonlight. Even though there were many stars visible, this object plainly stood out from the surrounding astronomical bodies. It appeared to stand still, it changed in brightness and it flickered, throbbed and pulsated. It did not suddenly accelerate, break up, give off smoke or change shape. It moved neither in front of nor behind another object or cloud. It appeared to be solid in form, was brighter than an automobile more than a mile away, and changed from red to green to yellow at regular intervals. There was no sound. The size of it was estimated with certainty to be that of a quarter held at arm's length as seen through binoculars. It's edges were fuzzy, and SOURCE indicated that he felt it was consistent of a heat resistant alloy, a minimum of two feet in diameter, and was approximately two hundred miles high and two thousand miles away. When he last observed the object it was at an azimuth of 150° and an elevation of 3-5°; it gradually faded away during the last five minutes. The sky was clear, there was no wind, and the weather was cold and dry. SOURCE stated that he next observed the object as a man-made satellite.

At the same time on the next evening (060LLZ Mar 56) SOURCE observed the same object at the same location. Its characteristics were generally the same as the night before, but it was observed for thirty minutes. On this occasion it ran yellow with red flashes at regular intervals.

        Education: High School Graduate

II.   RELIABILITY: SOURCE was completely thorough in her description of the sightings. SOURCE was extremely cooperative and of average intelligence.

III.  SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS: SOURCE and her husband were on duty at the COG post at Fairchild Field, Graham, North Carolina (Gulf 3595), when the object was sighted at a 170° azimuth and at an elevation of 10°. SOURCE observed the object at 0501ISZ Mar 56, and was certain she observed it for ten minutes. She reported the observation to the Durham, North Carolina, Filter Center (GJMF 0599) and was instructed to contact the Antioch, North Carolina Filter Center AISS. SOURCE stated that no aircraft were in the vicinity.

The sky was clear and many stars were visible. The moon condition was not recalled. The weather was cool and dry, a slight breeze was blowing. The object appeared to stand still at times and to speed up. It did not break up, gave off smoke, change in brightness or shape, flicker or throb. It moved neither in front of nor behind anything else. It appeared to be solid and presumably changed from amber to red and was brighter than an auto headlight at a distance greater than a mile. From red it turned green, and then back to amber; this occurred at regular intervals. The object made no sound. SOURCE viewed object through eyeglasses, 7x50 binoculars, and window glass. The object looked like a bright star. SOURCE was fairly certain that the object compared in size to a quarter held at arm's length, and she was looking south-southeast when the object was first sighted and south when it disappeared. Object did not disappear due to distance but sank below the horizon. SOURCE stated that the object disappeared to be approximately 620 miles away. When the object disappeared it was on an azimuth of 180° and an elevation of 0°. This was the first sighting of this type SOURCE had ever observed.

At the same time on the next evening (060152 Mar 56) SOURCE observed the same object at the same location. Its characteristics were the same as the night before, but it was observed for thirty minutes on that occasion.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was on duty at the GOC post, Fairchild Field, Graham, North Carolina (GOC 3505), when he sighted the object at 0500(2) hrs 16, at an azimuth of 125° and an elevation of 60. It appeared to be circular in shape and brilliant white in color with a blinking red light superimposed on it. The edge or the object was fuzzy. It was brighter than the background of the sky, and its brightness compared to that of an auto headlight a mile or more away. The object appeared to flicker and throb, to stand still at times and also to suddenly speed up and rush away. It did not move behind or in front of any other object. The sky was very dark but many stars were visible.

The weather was clear, dry and warm, and a slight breeze was blowing. The object compared in size to a half-dollar held at arms length when viewed through binoculars. It was viewed through eyeglasses and 7x50 binoculars. SOURCE estimated it to be round, to be 12 feet in diameter, to be made of plastic or bright metal, and compared it in size to a large weather balloon. Object disappeared at 1350 altitude and seemed to drop behind the horizon. SOURCE grabbed that he felt a bright hazy beam ran made satellite rotating around the earth. The sun's reflection could have accounted for the light observed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. The Flight Service Center of Maxwell AFB, Alabama (GJLC 1023), was contacted. 
Lt Anderson gave a negative report regarding the presence of aircraft in the area in question at the time indicated.

2. The United States Weather Station, Greensboro, North Carolina (GJLC 1205), released the balloon and the way of the sighting, one at Chilsook and the other at 090302 March 55. Normally neither would have accounted for the sightings on both of these occasions. The balloons were shortly after released. The observer's account of weather data is as follows: sky, clear; visibility, fifteen miles; ceiling, unlimited. Winds were surface, 150 at 7 knots; 6,000 Ft, 280° at 10 knots; 10,000 ft, 250° at 30 knots; 16,000 ft, 290° at 12 knots; 20,000 ft, 280° at 87 knots; 50,000 ft. to 80,000 ft. no available.

3. Dr Cravens, astronomer at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee (GJFC 0558), reported that Venus was very bright in the southwest and that Jupiter was very bright in the east. He knew of no other astronomical phenomena that might have contributed to the sightings.

4. The 663rd ACGW Squadron, Lake City, Tennessee (GJFC 5113), indicated that negative observations were made at the indicated times.

5. The 632nd ACGW Squadron, Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina (GJLC 2127), indicated that negative observations were made at the indicated times. The only information it possessed was an information copy of the initial teletype message reporting the sightings.

6. The 792nd ACGW Squadron, Charleston, South Carolina (GJLC 0447), also indicated that negative observations were made at the indicated times.

7. The Operations Officer, Pope AFB, North Carolina (GJLF 5910), indicated that there was only one aircraft, that could have possibly accounted for the sighting on 4 March 55. A C-119 enroute from Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio (GJFK 5648), to Pope Landsat at 050442. He stated that the aircraft passed near the area in question. No aircraft were in that area on 5 March 55 at the indicated time.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer (Contd):
        The preparing officer feels that the object was probably a heavenly body (star or planet) and that there might have been some error in giving its exact flight path. This hypothesis is based upon the many characteristics associated with stars and planets that were possessed by the object. The fact that it was observed in the exact orbit on the same night tends to lend additional weight to this hypothesis. The third and fourth nights were overcast and no observations were possible.

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer:

1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was astronomical in nature. To in further substantiate this the star Sirius was observed by the star Sirius. In addition to the data contained on the preceding pages the following is given in support of the above hypothesis:

    a. At the time of the sighting Sirius was located at the same position as the UFOB.

    b. Sirius has a magnitude of -1.6 and frequently appears to radiate an array of brilliant colors, notably red, blue, and green.

    c. The object was reported on 5, 6, and 9 March 1956. In all three reports the object was at the same time and in the same relative position.

2. In view of the persisting nature of the object, the colors viewed and the fact that Sirius was located in the same relative position as the UFOB, it is the opinion of this headquarters that the sighting was a misinterpretation of the star Sirius.
