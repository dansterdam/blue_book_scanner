II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was completely thorough in his description of the sightings. SOURCE was extremely cooperative and was of superior intelligence.

III. SOURCE’S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE and his wife were on duty at the COC post, Fairchild Fields, Graham, North Carolina (GJIJS 305), when the object was first sighted at 050115Z March 1955. It was at an azimuth of 175° and an elevation of from 3-5°. SOURCE was certain he observed the object for a total of ten minutes. It was pointed out to him by another observer. He observed it with the naked eyes, with eyeglasses, without eyeglasses through 7x50 binoculars and with eyeglasses through 7x50 binoculars. After watching it for approximately five minutes SOURCE and his wife drove to another COC post approximately ten miles south. There they again observed it, but on this occasion no binoculars were available.

SOURCE stated there was neither daylight nor moonlight. Even though there were many stars visible, the object plainly stood out from the surrounding astronomical bodies. It appeared to stand still, it changed in brightness and it flickered, throbbed and pulsated. It did not suddenly accelerate, break up, give off smoke or change shape. It moved neither in front of nor behind another object or cloud. it appeared to be solid in form, was brighter than an auto headlight more than a mile away, and changed from red to green to yellow at regular intervals. There was no sound. The size of it was estimated with certainty to be that of a quarter held at arm’s length as seen through binoculars. It’s edges Were fuzzy, and SOURCE indicated that he felt it was constructed of a heat resistant alloy, was a minimum of two feet in diameter, and was approximately two hundred miles high and two thousand miles away. When he last observed the object it was at an azimuth of 115° and an elevation of 3-5°; it gradually faded away during the last five minutes. The sky was clear, there was no wind, and the weather was cold and dry. SOURCE stated that he felt the object was a man made satellite.

At the same time on the next evening (06011Z Mar 56) SOURCE observed the same object at the same location. Its characteristics were generally the same as the night before, but it was observed for thirty minutes. On that occasion it was yellow with red flashes at regular intervals.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was completely thorough in her description of the sightings. SOURCE was extremely cooperative and of average intelligence.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS: SOURCE and her husband were on duty at the COC post at Fairchild Field, Graham, North Carolina (GULG 305), when the object was sighted at a 170° azimuth and at an elevation of 10°. SOURCE observed the object at 0501L52 Mar 56, and was certain she observed it for ten minutes. She reported the observation in the Durham, North Carolina, Filter Center (GUMP 0559) and was instructed to continue watching the object. The Filter Center informed SOURCE that no aircraft were in her vicinity.

The sky was clear and many stars were visible. The moon condition was not recalled. The weather was cool and dry; a slight breeze was blowing. The object appeared to stand still at times and to speed up. It did not break up, give off smoke, change in brightness or shape, flicker or throb. It moved neither in front of nor behind anything else. It appeared to be solid and ranged in color from amber to red and was brighter than an auto headlight at a distance greater than a mile. From red its turned green, and then back to amber; this occurred at regular intervals. The object made no sound. SOURCE viewed object through eyeglasses, 7x50 binoculars, and window glass, the edges of the object looked like a bright star. SOURCE was certain that the object appeared in size by a quarter held at arm's length, and she was looking just southeast when the object was first sighted and south when it disappeared. Object did not disappear due to distance but sank below the horizon. SOURCE stated that the object appeared to be approximately 60 miles away. When the object disappeared it was on an azimuth of 180° and an elevation of 0°. This was the first sighting of this type SOURCE had ever observed.

At the same time on the next evening (0601L52 Mar 56) SOURCE observed the same object at the same location. Its characteristics were the same as the night before, but it was observed for thirty minutes on that occasion.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was on duty at the GOC post, Fairchild Field, Graham, North Carolina (G119 3505), when he sighted the object at 0501lOZ Mar 56, at an azimuth of 175° and an elevation of 60°. It appeared to
be circular in shape and brilliant white in color with a blinking red light sup- 
erimposed on it. The edge of the object was fuzzy. It was brighter than the
background of the sky, and its brightness compared to that of an auto headlight
a mile or more away. The object appeared to flicker and throb, to stand still at
times and also to suddenly speed up and rush away. It did not move behind or in 
front of any other object. The sky was very dark but many stars were visible.
The weather was clear, dry and warm, and a slight breeze was blowing. The object 
compared in size to a half-dollar held at arm’s length when viewed through bin-
oculars. It was viewed through eyeglasses and 7x50 binoculars. SOURCE estimated
it to be round, to be 12 feet in diameter, to be made of plastic or bright metal
and compared in size to a large weather balloon. Object disappeared at 1350Z 
alum and seemed to drop behind the horizon. SOURCE stated that he felt it 
might have been a man made satellite rotating around the earth. The sun’s reflec-
tion could have accounted for the light observed.

reported seeing the object. SOURCE proceeded to the post where he also observed 
it. He saw the object in the south, and was fairly certain that he observed it 
for one minute. The sky was dark but stars were visible. The weather was clear, 
cool and dry; a slight breeze was blowing. The object appeared to stand still 
and change in brightness. It did not suddenly speed up, break up, give off smoke 
or change shape. Neither did it move in front of or behind any other objects. It

edges were sharply outlined and it made no sound. SOURCE was fairly certain 
that it compared in size to a baseball held at arm’s length. It disappeared over 
the horizon. SOURCE estimated the object to be two or three miles away, and he 
thought it was caused by some type of weather phenomena. This was the first 
sighting SOURCE had witnessed.

.PART SEVEN

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. The Flight Service Center of Maxwell AFB, Alabama (J111C 1023), was contacted.
Lt Anderson gave a negative report regarding the presence of aircraft in the area in
question at the time indicated.

2. The United States Weather Station, Greensboro, .North Carolina (JlJ1C 1205),
released two ballons on the day of the sighting, one at 0l1500Z and the other at
050300Z March 55. Normally neither would have accounted for this sighting; on both
of these occasions the balloons burst shortly after release. The observer's account
of weather data is as follows: sky, clear; visibility, fifteen miles; ceiling,
unlimited. Winds were: surface, 150° at 7 knots; 6,000 ft, 280° at 11 knots;
10,000 ft, 2200 at 10 knots; 16,000 ft, 2900 at 12 knots; 20,000 ft, 2800 at 17 knots
50,000 ft to 80,000 ft, not available.

3. Dr Cravens, astronomer at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee
(GUF 0558), reported that Venus was very bright in the. southwest and that Jupiter
was very bright in the east. He knew of no other astronomical phenomena that might
have contributed to the sightings.

4. The 663rd AC&W Squadron, Lake City, Tennessee (GUIF 5113), indicated that
negative observations were made at the indicated times.

5. The 632nd AC&W Squadron, Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina (GJJNC 2127),
indicated that negative observations were made at the indicated times. The o6llY
information in possessed was an information copy of the initial teletype message
reporting the sightings.

6. The 792nd AC&W Squadron, Charleston, South Carolina (GJJIC 0447), also
indicated that negative observations were made at the indicated times.

7. The Operations Officer, Pope AFB, North Carolina(GJIF 5910), indicated
that there was only one aircraft that could have possibly accounted for the sighting
on b1
 March.55. A C-ll9 emroute from Wright Patterson
                                                                                              AFB Ohio (GJFF 5618), to
Pope landed at 0507LZ. He stated that the aircraft passed near the area in
question. No aircraft were in that area on 5 March 55 at the indicated time.

8. The Durham Filter Center, Durham, North Carolina (GJJF 0559), had no
information except the initial report of the GOC spotters that was called in by
Mrs Newcomer (see Part Two). The Tllter Center indicated that no aircraft were
in the vicinity at the time of the sighting.

9. A check with the McGhee Tyson Municipal Airport Flight Service Center,
Knoxville, Tennessee revealed that no aircraft from this area were in that area at
the time of the observations.
                                                                                            10. The two Squadron Intelligence Officers, McGhee Tyson Airport, Knoxville,

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. All Six (6) SOURCES had high school educations, and one also had some
mechanical trade school training. They all appeared to be sincere and reliable.
All ware evaluated as belng of average or above average intelligence. Three (3)
were law enforcement officers, and three (3) were GOC observers. Of the latter
group one (1) was a housewife, one (1) was a guided missile design engineer and
the third was a guided missile draftsman. These three (3) people are considered
well qualified, reliable observers because of their GOC and aeronautlcal technical
backgrounds.
2. The object did not possess the qualitles of an aircraft. It was visible from
ten (10) to thirty (30) minutes and no radar return was received. Also, all avail-
able SOURCES regarding aircraft scheduling reported none were in the area at the
specific time of the report with the possible exception of one (1) C-119 reported
landing at Pope ATB at 0501EST Mar 56. That could possibly account for the first
sighting except that there was no radar return. It would not account for the
second sighting, however.
3. The object appeared to have few qualitles possessed by a meteor. The long
duration of sighting and the second appearance seen to rule out this possibllity.
Likewise, it is improbable that It could have been some type of optical phenomena
due to the large number of observations and the various methods of observations
(the naked eye with no obstructions, naked eye with eyeglasses, through 7x50 bin-
oculars, and a combination of the fore mentioned methods through windows). The
fact that it appeared on the second night also helps rule out this posslbillty.
4. The possibllity that the sighting might have been a balloon seems unlikely
since the only two in the immediate vicinity could not have been observed at the
time of the sighting. Also, it is highly improbable that balloons on two separate
occasions would travel the exact same paths through the atmosphere. The possibllity
that weather phenomena caused the observation is slight since the sky was clear and
since it was observed on two separate nights.
5. All qualities associated with stars or planets seem to have been possessed
by the object with the exception of one - its course was not even remotely east
to west, but rather south-southeast to south. All six (6) of the SOURCES agreed
that its course was in this direction. The investigator observed the GOC tower
from which the many observations were made and stated that directionali equipment
was available. Investigator also checked the land marks over which the object
passed and the directions indicated were accurate. Its shape was that of a star
or planet, though a little larger according to some reports. It twinkled, throbbed,
flickereo and pulsated, and it varied in color from yellow or amber to red to green.
These variations in intensity and color are consistent with the sightings of heaven-
ly bodies.
6. Four (4) of the six (6) witnesses stated that they did not have any Idea of
what the object might have been. The two (2) guided Missile engineer stated that
they felt it was definitely not a heavenly bode. They further indicated that they
felt it was a man-made satellite sent aloft. They were quite sincere and emphatic
regarding this conclusion.

Flight 2-B, 4502d AISS

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer (Contd):

The preparing officer feels that the object was probably a heavenly body (star or planet) and that there might have been some error in giving its exact flight path. This hypothesis is based upon the many characteristics associated with stars and planets that were possessed by the object. The fact that it was observed in the exact orbit on the second night tends to lend additional weight to this hypothesis. The third and fourth nights were overcast and no observations were possible.

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer:

1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was astronomical in nature. It is further submitted that this sighting was generated by the star Sirius. In addition to the data contained on the preceding pages the following is given in support of the above hypothesis:

a. At the time of the sighting Sirius was located at the same position as the UFOB.

b. Sirius has a magnitude of -1.6 and frequently appears to radiate an array of brilliant colors, notably red, blue, and green.

c. The object was reported on 5, 6, and 9 March 1956. In all three reports the object was seen at the same time and in the same relative position.

2. In view of the persisting nature of the object, the colors viewed and the fact that Sirius was located in the same relative position as the UFOB, it is the opinion of this headquarters that the sighting was a misinterpretation of the star Sirius.
