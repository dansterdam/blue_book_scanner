SUMMARY: (Enter summary of report. Use supplemental pages if necessary)

On 3 April 1953, at 0235h, in the vicinity of UTM coordinates YO 3050, Lt. Colonel John L. Dillon, a B-26 pilot flying night armed reconnaissance on a heading of 355 degrees, with an indicated airspeed of 200 mph, and at an altitude of 5,000 feet, 500 feet on top of a solid overcast, observed a bluish green object about 200 feet from his aircraft, on a level, parallel flight with the aircraft. The heading of the object was the same as that of the aircraft. The object turned from bluish green to white, then to red and turned out. Leaving a trail of sparks as it turned red. No trail was observed until it turned red. The object was in sight for at least two seconds; long enough to train slightly on it. The aircraft could have fired on it, but it was known what it was. The speed of the object was excessive, estimated to be traveling at about 1500 mph. The size was about the size of the tail pipe of an F-80.

COMMENTS BY THE PREPARING OFFICER: Lt. Colonel Dillon has completed 22 combat missions, and is considered a reliable in reporting observations. The reporting officer was also a member of the crew, and his observations are concurrent with the above report.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. On 3 April 1953, at 0231L, in the vicinity of UTM coordinates Yi-3885, 1/Lt Perry, 1/Lt Frederick W. Vermillion, navigator, and A/2c William R. Caruthers, engineer, all crew members of a B-26 flying Night Armed Reconnaissance, on a heading of 010 degrees, with an indicated airspeed of 200, and at an altitude of 7,500 feet, 1,500 feet above an 8-10/10 overcast, observed an unidentified flying object.

2. 1/Lt Perry observed a white light descending from very high altitude to approximately level with his aircraft. The object was traveling at a very high speed on a heading of approximately 100 degrees. 1/Lt Perry would not attempt to estimate the distance of the object from the aircraft. The object appeared to be white with no noticeable change in color. He observed the object gradually increased in size until it disappeared. He estimated that it was observed for approximately five (5) seconds.

3. 2/Lt Vermillion's statements were the same as the above with the exception that the color of the object was greenish at first observation, and then turned red and disappeared. He observed the object for approximately ten (10) seconds.

4. A/2c Caruthers stated the same as above although he observed the object to be green at first, then turned red and then white and went out. He stated these changes of color were simultaneous. He estimated his observation to be approximately three (3) seconds. He observed the object from a 35 to 40 degree angle above the aircraft, and falling at a very rapid speed. He stated a meteor, and its estimated size to be approximately five (5) feet in diameter.

COMMENTS BY THE PREPARING OFFICER: This crew was very cooperative in reporting this object. This crew members have completed the following number of combat missions: 1/Lt Perry, 46 missions; 2/Lt Vermillion, 24 missions; and A/2c Caruthers, 12 missions. The information given by this crew is considered to be reliable.

COMMENT of the approving officer:

It is the opinion of this Directorate that this was probably the sighting of an unusually large meteor. At the time of this sighting the moon was entering the third quarter, which might have prevented the trailing sparks common to large meteors. From being readily observed. The reported change in color could have been due to: 1) the compositional of the meteor; 2) the refraction caused by different height angles of observation through the atmosphere, and; 3) the effect of the color of the cockpit and navigation equipment light, on the viewer's eyes.

This Directorate has no previous report of a similar observation on file. There was no evidence to indicate that the object was controlled in any manner, or that it was anything but an unusually large meteor.

COMMENT of the Approving Officer:

Information at this Directorate indicates that this was a possible observation of a small meteor. The changing color and sparks are probably the result of the meteor burning out in the earth's atmosphere. Because of the difficulty of estimating distance at night, the 200 feet may have been much more. It is doubted that this object was a projectile fired from a ground weapon, or another aircraft.
