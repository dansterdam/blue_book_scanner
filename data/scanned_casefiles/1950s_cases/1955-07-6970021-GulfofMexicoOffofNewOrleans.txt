                                        FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS OF PAST SIGHTINGS
                                        RINGED CYLINDER OVER PATERSON

Late July, 1955: On a weekday evening late in July 1955, 19-year-old Daniel K. O'Connor, of Paterson, New Jersey, was sitting in a park off Main Street at about 8 p.m. when he saw a peculiar object of a very metallic color in the sky. He described the shape as a cylinder on end with a circular ring running horizontally around the center of the object. Within this circular ring was a rotating light (see diagram). The object, about as long as 1½ was wide, appeared to be as large as a silver dollar held at arm's length. Its edges were clear and sharply defined. Seen in the southern sky, the object was retreating at a moderate speed to the west and finally became just a pinpoint in the bright twilight sky. It had remained in clear view for about 10 minutes. The sky was clear. Mr. O'Connor reported that others had also seen the object, but no names and addresses were available. The details were obtained from the witness by CSI members Arthur Shattuck and Frank Principe.
