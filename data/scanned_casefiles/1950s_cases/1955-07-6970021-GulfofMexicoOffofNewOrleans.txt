The image contains a Project 10073 Record Card form that appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The form shows that the sighting occurred on 15 Jul 55 in the Gulf of Mexico off of New Orleans. The object observed was reported to be shaped like a drop of water with a diameter of approx. 15 inches. The conclusion on the form is that the object was a "probable balloon".

FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS OF PAST SIGHTINGS
RINGED CYLINDER OVER PATERSON
Late July, 1955: On a weekday evening late in July 1955, 19-year-old Daniel K. (Omitted) of Paterson, New Jersey, was sitting in a park off Main Street at about 9 p.m. when he saw a peculiar object of a grey metallic color in the sky. He described the shape as a cylindrical ring moving horizontally around the center of the object. Within this circular ring was a rotating light (see diagram). The object was about as wide as his outstretched arm's length. Its edges were clear and sharply defined. Seen in the southern sky, the object was retreating at a moderate speed to the west and finally became just a pinpoint in the clear view for about 10 minutes. The sky was clear. Mr. (Omitted) reported that others had also seen the object, but no names and addresses were available. The details were obtained from the witness by CSI members Arthur Shattuck and Frank Parrishes.
