ATPC Archives and comments:

1. This is not a UFO and not from Outer Space.
2. Smile while it lasts, others that the only way reflect of the activity needs explanation. Tell Captain after only the possible incident to the radar and the rest of the knowledge would not. (Spoken before.)
3. Flying 25 mph. Only a hallucination that shows, or all have to that space tourist.
4. Right man Bethel, Conn. Okay, with radar and 1619 dear miss-shows altitude 4.40 is the slightest person has not a single place for that early morning any meeting.
5. Four(?) Navy at the air at that time - only imagination this type? Highly improbable!

The image contains a photograph of a "Wing-Saucer" object that was reportedly seen over Bethel, Connecticut on March 10, 1950. The text describes that the object circled over the center of Bethel four times, and on the fourth time around, it banked left at 45 degrees, at which point a "brilliant white light" was seen on the bottom of the "Wing-Saucer" and a dark object was seen revolving at a slow rate of speed. The object disappeared in a northeasterly direction and was visible for three minutes.

The image also contains a drawing that is described as a "bottom view of 'WING' seen 5,000 feet from Earth."

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document describing the observation of three single engine Navy bi-wing planes flying in formation over a woodworking factory in Bethel, Connecticut. The observer noticed a large black "wing-like" object flying very slowly at an altitude of approximately eight thousand feet, and on the fourth pass a brilliant white light appeared at the bottom center of the "wing-like" object before it quickly picked up speed and disappeared. The document concludes with the observer stating "This is a TRUE report of what I have seen in the sky over the center of Bethel, Connecticut, on Monday, March 10, 1950. O HELP ME GOD."

Three single engine Navy bi-wing planes were flying in formation over the WOODWORKING CO factory at an altitude of approximately four thousand feet in the center of Bethel, Conn. The witness watched them. I noticed a large black "WING-SHAPE" flying very slowly in circles eight thousand feet in height to the left of the three Navy planes. The whole underside was jet black. Only on the fourth time around did I see a brilliant white light on the bottom center of the "WING-SHAPE". It circled very, very slowly. When light went on, jet black color of "WING-SHAPE" was hardly noticeable. It then picked up speed very quickly and disappeared within seconds from my view in a Northeasterly direction. This is a TRUE report of what I have seen in the sky over the center of Bethel, Connecticut, on Monday, March 10, 1950. O HELP ME GOD.
