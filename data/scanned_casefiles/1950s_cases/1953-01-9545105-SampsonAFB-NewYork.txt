GO NOTES: 1. Object observed by theodolite. Glides too fast (300 ft. min.) to be a star. No balloon launches at Sampson AFB.

2. Sampson AFB answered ATC KK and stated the Westwood Boston Airlines flight was in general area at 1815 EST.

1. This report contains information of the sighting of a luminous object from
Sampson Air Force Base, New York at 1820 hours, 26 January 1953.

2. A/2C observed in letter form the visual observation
of a luminous object about 120 feet long and 12 feet wide. The object traveled
through the sky from east to west at an altitude estimated to be between 7,000
and 10,000 feet. Both the front and the rear of the object seemed to have a very
luminous appearance, but the lengthy body was clearly outlined. The object seemed to
rapidly gain altitude then fade away. A high-pitched hum, similar to that of an
electrical motor, was heard coming from the object or the area of the object. The
object disappeared from sight then was heard for a few seconds then the sound
apparently ceased.

3. The second witness A/2C from his quarters by A/2C also of Sampson AFB, stated in letter
form that he had been called from his quarters by A/2C and had also seen the objects.

4. Further investigation revealed that the object apparently traveled from east
to west through an arc of 70 to 80 degrees in a straight shallow climb. A
theodolite reading taken later determined the angle of elevation at initial sight-
ing to be approximately 009 degrees. At the end of the sighting the arc was
estimated to be 040 degrees. The duration of the sighting was approximately one
minute.

5. A check of weather conditions revealed: clear, 10 miles visibility, winds light:
2000 - 370 degrees at 12K
1,000 - 010 degrees at 21K
5000 - 350 degrees at 30K
3000 - 340 degrees at 35K
10,000 - 340 degrees at 40K
12,000 - 330 degrees at 40K

UNCLASSIFIED

27 January 53

At 1520 hrs., 26 January 53, I observed a luminous object about one hundred eighty feet long and twelve feet wide traveling through the sky from east to west at what appeared to be between seven and ten thousand feet. Both the front and rear of the object seemed to have a hazy appearance, but the lengthy body was clearly outlined. It also gave off the sound of a high-pitched huma, similar to that of an electric motor. After a minute, the object seemed to gain altitude very rapidly and it slowly faded away. I could still hear the sound for a few seconds after it was completely gone, then the sound stopped abruptly. One witness, a man from my barracks, heard the sound after the light was gone. This all took place in front of Barracks G11.

at about 1542 hrs., 28 January 53, I was called from my room by [redacted] to see some object in the sky. Upon leaving the barracks to see the object he talked about, I saw nothing, but did hear a peculiar high pitched hum which lasted not more than a few seconds.

I.   Description of Incident:
     At 2320 Z an airman at Sampson AFB, New York, visually observed one large luminous rectangular shaped unidentified flying object. In one minute the object traveled through an arc of 70 or 80 degrees, while emitting a humming sound.

II.  Discussion of Incident:
     The object above described appeared for only one minute, consequently analysis is very difficult. However, ATIC reported information concerning local aircraft and was told a commercial flight was in the area around the sighting time.

III. Conclusion:
     Possibly aircraft.
