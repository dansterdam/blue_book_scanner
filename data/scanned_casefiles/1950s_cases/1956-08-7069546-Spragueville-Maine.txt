"(U) Request for UFO Report Analysis

TO: AFOIN-4Eb FROM: AFOIN-4E1 DATE: 25 Sep 56 COMMENT: NR 2
Capt Gregrory AFOIN-4E1/lhf Beyant/Hth

1. Although this report is more thoroughly documented than most, it is impossible to make a positive identification of the object(s) observed. The fact that the object, described as 35-40 feet in diameter, yet was not observed visually at 4000 yards in daylight under good conditions, tends to indicate either equipment malfunction or some other source rather than a material target.

2. The fact that the radar operator's scope and the pilot's scope displayed two different sets of conditions according to their accounts would also indicate possible equipment malfunction.
