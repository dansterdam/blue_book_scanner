10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
This sighting, as noted above, was picked up on airborne radar. Object appeared on radar scope as two aircraft or one large aircraft. Intercept aircraft lost radar contact with object at 4000 yards. At this time pilot and radar observer felt they should have been able to see object visually.

Radar observer estimated that object was moving at over 500K. Object was tracked for three minutes.

1. Although this report is more thoroughly documented than most, it is impossible to make a positive identification of the source of the radar signals. The fact that the radar return was as large as a formation of 2 aircraft, (or 1 large aircraft) at the miles, yet was not observed visually at 1000 yards in daylight under good conditions, tends to indicate either equipment malfunction or some other source rather than a material target.

2. The fact that the radar operator's scope and the pilot's scope displayed two different sets of conditions, according to their accounts, would also indicate possible malfunction of the AI Radar.
