H. NO OTHER UNUSUAL CONDITIONS.
I. OBSERVER DROVE TO HIGHEST SPOT IN AREA TO ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE MORE ABOUT OBJECT. ABOUT ONE HALF HOUR AFTER SIGHTING A CIVILIAN CESSNA TYPE AIRCRAFT SCOUTED AREA WITHOUT SUCCESS. WITHIN ONE AND ONE HALF HOURS AFTER ORIGINAL SIGHTING, SCOUTED AREA IN HIS OWN AIRCRAFT, COVERING APPROXIMATELY 20 MILE CIRCLE BUT NO FURTHER SIGHTING.

J. SIGHTING OCCURRED WITHIN 10 MILES OF ELLSWORTH AFB AND WITHIN 4 MILES OF RAPID CITY MUNICIPAL AIRPORT BUT NO EVIDENCE OF ANY AIRCRAFT IN VICINITY OF SIGHTED OBJECT AT THAT PRECISE TIME.

K. INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 28TH BOMB WING, [REDACTED] IS A TRAINED OBSERVER AND QUALIFIED PILOT. HE IS THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH WEATHER BALLONS, WEATHER PHENOMENA, ETC. HIS SIGHTING WAS MADE UNDER GOOD DAYLIGHT CONDITIONS WITH SUN BEHIND HIM AND VERY POSITIVE OF SIGHTING EVEN THOUGH IT WAS VERY BRIEF. A 28 INCH BALLON WAS RELEASED AT 10:30AM (S73CZ) FROM MUNICIPAL AIRPORT APPROXIMATELY 3-1/2 MILES NNE OF SIGHTED OBJECT. THIS TYPE OF BALLON NORMALLY RISES UNTIL IT BURSTS, HOWEVER.

L. NONE.
