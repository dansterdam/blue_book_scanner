DATE OF REPORT: 14 Aug 52 | DATE OF INFORMATION: 13 Aug 52 | EVALUATION: C-3

PREPARED BY: 2/Lt W. M. Cowley - 1st Wg Intel C | SOURCE: 1/10 J. F. Marvin AF 15276683

SUMMARY:
It is the belief of the Interrogation Officer that the Airman observed meteorological movement. It has been reported that there is much activity of this kind in the area, generally north and south can horizon, pattern around 2200 hours CE.

Also, he noticed no error in the area when the traffic pattern was full of planes due to electric light failure on the runway.

Conversation with several men who were both flying and on the ground in area and no one can verify even seeing the object.

Other Airmen who witnessed the same object have about the identical story.

In accordance with Air Force Letter 200-5, dated 29 Apr 52, par 2:

(1) Small round shaped object of intense white color, trail following about (5) six times the size of the object and also white that tapered to a cone shape. Only one (1) object sighted. Object gave an appearance of an egg, when cone (1) was included. There was no visible propulsion unit, sound or maneuvers. Object traveled at a speed about twice that of any jet, and disappearance was due to altitude.

(2) Time of sighting was 13/0250Z and observed for about 45 seconds.

(3) Object seen from parked convertible with top down.

(4) Location of Observer on World Aeronautical Chart #468 - Galveston Bay MA (approx) 30° 08' N/23° 11'W. South side of Lake Charles, La. Object traveling from North - South at about 5,000 feet.

STATEMENT OF FACT

About 2050 hours, 12 August 1952, I returned home from town with my wife, when about to leave cars, in driveway next to house, I spotted a round shaped object from the front seat of my convertible with the top down. It was traveling from North to South at a speed twice as fast as any observed jet at about 5,000 feet. I observed it for about 45 seconds. It was white in color, with a trail - cone shaped; also white, behind it. The weather was very clear and the object disappeared due to distance. There was no sound, no maneuvers, traveling straight horizontal at terrific speed.

SECTION D

22. In the following sketch, imagine your eye at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" to show where it was when you last saw it.
Overhead

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

[A horizontal line with A at the left and B at the right]

1. Keep same altitude
2. Keep same height
3. Same speed
4. No change of direction - then stranger (?)

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

SECTION E

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this?
(Circle One): Yes or No

26.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? [Handwritten text is partially illegible, appears to discuss a flying object and some uncertainty about its nature]

28. Give the following information about yourself:
NAME [Redacted]
ADDRESS: [Redacted] LAKE CHARLES, LA.
TELEPHONE NUMBER: [Redacted]
What is your present job? INSTRUMENT SPECIALIST (AIR PLANE) (4356)

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

As stated on form 112, due to later interrogation another airman saw same object. Only could give enough information to confirm report but wasn't as complete or accurate.
