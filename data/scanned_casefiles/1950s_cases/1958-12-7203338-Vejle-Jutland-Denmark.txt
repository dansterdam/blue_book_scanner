NEITHER THEIR NOR THIS OFFICE IS IN A POSITION TO EVALUATE IT CMT

HOWEVER ACCORDING TO OUR CALCULATIONS THIS OBSERVATION MAY

WITHIN THREE MIS OF THE EXPECTED CROSSING OF DELTA ONE PD

THIS COULD BE A PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THE EFFORT WE

HAVE LAID ON LOCALLY THRU OUR SPACE TRACK OBSERVERS AND NOT

VALID PD THIS OFFICE IS UNABLE TO EVALUATE AND CONSEQUENTIALLY

REPORTS ACCORDINGLY PD ON THE OTHER HAND THIS OBSERVER BEING AN

AMATEUR ASTRONOMER IS LESS LIKELY TO REPORT FANTASY
