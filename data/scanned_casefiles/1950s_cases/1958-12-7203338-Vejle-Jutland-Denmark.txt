HIS OBSERVATIONS BEGAN AT 1800 HOURS. HE OBSERVED SOMETHING THAT APPEARED TO BE FIVE TIMES THE SIZE OF A LARGE STAR IN THE EASTERN SKY. THIS OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR THREE MINUTES, THEN STARTED MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST. THE OBSERVER CALCULATED THAT IT WAS MOVING AT APPROXIMATELY 400 KNOTS, OR ABOUT 480 MILES PER HOUR. AFTER MOVING FOR SIX MINUTES, IT STOPPED AND REMAINED STATIONARY FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, THEN STARTED MOVING AGAIN IN THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION. THIS OBSERVER STATES OVER THE PERIOD OF THIS OBSERVATION, WHICH LASTED FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES, THE OBJECT MADE SEVERAL STOPS AND STARTS. THIS TELESCOPIC OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY A NAVAL OFFICER OF HIGH RANK WHO WAS A TRAINED OBSERVER OF THIS TYPE. FOR FURTHER TRYIN FOR THIS OFFICE IS IN A POSITION TO EVALUATE IT HOWEVER ACCORDING TO OUR CALCULATIONS THIS OBSERVATION WAS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE EXTENDED CONSTELLATION OF DELTA CZ PN THIS COULD BE A PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THE EFFORT WE HAVE LAID OUR LOCALLY THRU OUR SPACE TRACK OBSERVERS AND NOT VALID WE THIS OFFICE IS UNABLE TO EVALUATE AND CONSTRUCTIVELY COMMENT ACCORDINGLY FD CR THIS OBSERVER SINCE AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER IS LESS LIKELY TO REPORT F A TASY
