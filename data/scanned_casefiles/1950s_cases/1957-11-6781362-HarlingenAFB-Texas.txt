1. Reference is made to your request for review and analysis of eleven (11) UFO reports.

2. Comments follow in order of enclosure numbers.
a. Enclosure #1: This UFO was not substantiated by any other evidence and was a faint target which appeared while the operator was working an aircraft and was a traffic pattern. Assistant Training Officer indicated a possibility of a traffic pattern. This office concurs that a radar malfunction was possible.

DATE: 15 NOV 57 COMMENT: AFOIN-33E/ACORN NR: 2
AFOIN-4544/1956
1. Reference is made to your request for review and analysis of eleven (11) UFO reports.
2. Comments follow in order of inclosure numbers:
a. Inclosure #1: This UFO was not substantiated by any other evidence and was a false target which appeared while the operators were working on different radar equipment in a radio maintenance organization. An alternate explanation is a possibility of radar malfunction.
b. Inclosure #2: This radar contact was probably due to unidentified aircraft passing through the area.
c. Inclosure #3: From the rather meager information in this report, it is likely that the targets sighted were due to unknown aircraft.
d. Inclosure #4: The evidence presented in this report indicates a good possibility of small targets of large birds.
e. Inclosure #5: There are several unusual things about this reported UFO sighting which suggest that the targets were probably caused by malfunctioning or misinterpretations of the radar equipment by the personnel at the time of sighting. This could mean that the radar equipment was not operating properly. (There is no mention made in the reports as to the experience, expertise, or other special qualifications of these personnel.)
Also, the report indicates the possibility of 'return to zero' indications on the scope which would rotate the antenna to determine whether the signals originated from a new bearing. (This would normally be an unusual maneuver but the report appears to indicate that the antenna was not rotating.) Further, it appears to indicate that the antenna was not rotating, possibly indicating a malfunction in the normal operating scope and could possibly be more reliable observers than maintenance personnel. It is concluded that the reported radar paint was rather an equipment malfunction than an actual target.
f. Inclosure #6: This evidence indicates the possibility that radar reflections from clouds or rain storms caused the unexplained signals. Subsequent analysis which compares B-band equipment vs L-band equipment indicates the probability that radar anomalies of a meteorological origin rather than L-band equipment.
g. Inclosure #7: It is difficult to understand how 3500 mph targets would stay on the scope for 60 miles. There is a possibility that weather or anomalous propagation caused the reported radar blips.
h. Inclosure #8: Same sighting as Inclosure #7.

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.
SUBJECT: Request - Analysis and Comments, Electronic UFO Reports
TO: AFCIN-3EL1 FROM: AFCIN-3EL1 DATE: 13 Apr 1956 COMMENT NO. 1

1. Attached are eleven (11) official UFO reports received from various Air Force radar units for your review and analysis.

2. It will be appreciated if you can only a limited summary which this division has found as follows:

a. Nearly all reports contain data which, in our opinion, is of little scientific or technical value. The majority of reports consist of sighting of lights or objects in the sky which this division has found are common occurrences and pose no threat to the security of the United States.

b. It would appear that radar UFO reports have increased in volume during the past few months. However, this trend will continue in the future, as in the past, if normal operations are maintained by Air Force radar units.

3. This division is of the opinion that your office may consider obtaining the services of either a psychological or a technical consultant to assist you in the analysis and evaluation of these reports. Reference is made to your letter dated 13 Jan 56, copy attached.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

SUBJECT: Request - Analysis and Comments, Electronic UFO Reports

1. Enclosure #9: Since no confirming evidence was presented, it is assumed that the conclusions presented in these reports could be exaggerated.

2. Enclosure #10: Radar range of the reported target is not given. This is a possible important clue is missing. The possibility of a balloon or an unidentified aircraft cannot be ruled out.

3. Enclosure #11: This reported UFO possibly could have been one object or two objects separated as to indicate unidentified aircraft. High rate of speed was described in the report, but no estimate is given as to the actual speed. The object described to traverse a given distance in a short period of time.
