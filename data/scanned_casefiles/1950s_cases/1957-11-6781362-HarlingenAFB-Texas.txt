SUBJECT: Request - Analysis and Comments, Electronic UFO Reports

TO: AFCIN-4bh     FROM: AFCIN-4bE     DATE: 3 Feb 59     COMMENTS NO. 2
                                        AFCIN-4bW. Photosmt/3c
                                        TACON/Msg 828/MA 241

1. Reference is made to your request for review and analysis of eleven (11) UFO reports.

2. Comments follow in order of inclosure numbers.

a. Inclosure #1: This UFO was not substantiated by any other evidence and was a thin target which appeared while the operator was working in a different azimuth pattern. Assistant Wing Operations Officer indicated a possibility of a radar malfunction. This office concurs that a radar malfunction was possible.

b. Inclosure #2: This radar paint was probably due to unidentified aircraft passing through the area.

c. Inclosure #3: From the rather meager information in this report, it is likely that the radar sighting was due to unidentified aircraft.

d. Inclosure #4: The evidence presented in this report indicates a good possibility of a small flock of large birds.

e. Inclosure #5: There are several unusual things about this reported UFO sighting. First, the equipment was evidently under control of maintenance personnel at the time of sighting. This could mean that the radar equipment was not in perfect adjustment, or some sort of target simulator or other special equipment was being used in connection with the maintenance operation. (There is no mention of this in the report, however.) Also, the report gives no indication of any attempt to rotate the antenna to a new bearing to determine whether the original signal inside the equipment. (This question arises since the azimuth of the target was reported to be nearly the same throughout the time of interception and, therefore, appears to indicate that the antenna was not rotating.) Further, regular operating personnel are generally more familiar with the appearance of a particular radar scope and could possibly be more reliable observers than maintenance personnel, it is concluded that possibly a false target due to equipment malfunction rather than an actual target caused the reported radar paint.

f. Inclosure #6: The evidence presented in this report indicates the possibility that radar reflections from clouds or rain storms caused the unexplained blips. Equipments which operate at S-band usually are more susceptible to weather phenomena than L-band equipments. It is assumed that the search equipment which did not pick up the reported blips was operating in the L-band.

g. Inclosure #7: It is difficult to understand how 3600 mph targets would stay on a 40-mile scope for 41 minutes. There is a possibility that weather or anomalous propagation caused the reported radar blips.

h. Inclosure #8: Same sighting as Inclosure #7.

1. Attached are eleven (11) official UFO reports received from various Air Force radio units for your review and analysis.

2. These represent only those which this division has found a little difficult to evaluate or conclude.

3. It should be pointed out that radar UFO reports have increased noticeably the last six (6) months; and it appears that this trend will continue in the future.

4. This matter was discussed with your staff earlier this year, in the possibility that your office may consider obtaining the services of either an electronic UFO specialist or consultant. Reference your DF, Comment Nr. 2, dated 13 Jan 58, copy attached.

1. Enclosure #9: Since no confirming evidence was presented, it is assumed that anomalous propagation of some sort caused the reported track.

j. Enclosure #10: Radar range of the reported target is not given. Thus, a possible important clue is missing. The possibility of a balloon or an unidentified aircraft cannot be ruled out completely.

k. Enclosure #11: This reported UFO possibly could have been one object or two objects seen at a time. Both might have been on a return as an indication unidentified aircraft. High rate of speed was mentioned in the report, but no attempt was made to estimate the speed. The object seemed to reverse direction at times, but no explanation is given, especially a light source or a helicopter. Suggestion is made that the radar station should have made every possible attempt to identify the object at the time of sighting.
