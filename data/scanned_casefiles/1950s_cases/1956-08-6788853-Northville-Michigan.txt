Here is the text I can read from the document:

IN

[Some text at the top appears partially illegible]

TN COMDR SELCT ACMRON SAFE MICH
TO BUTEC POMDT AGO HQ APO COLORADO DENVER
[Rest of the text is partially cut off or difficult to read clearly]

Handwritten markings include:
- "5 Pig 26" at top left
- "ACTION" stamp
- Various numerical codes like "3144", "8472", "C118"

Some lines appear to be partially obscured or cut off, making full OCR challenging. The document seems to be a military communication or routing slip dated 9 August 1956.

There are also some handwritten notes on the right side of the document, but they are partially illegible. Some words I can make out include "College" and what appears to be partial location notes, but I cannot confidently transcribe the full handwritten text.

Several sections of the document are blacked out/redacted, particularly at the bottom of the page.

Most of the document appears to be partially obscured or illegible, with several lines of text that are not fully readable. There are numerical entries on the left side of the page, but the full context and content cannot be determined from this image.
