AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. I am pilot of a C 47 type aircraft at 1 August 1952 at 0710 hours when I suddenly I saw an unknown object in the sky approximately 7,000 feet above my aircraft. The weather was clear and stable and all conditions normal.

2. The object was white and which all could see. Capt Kelly, of an eternal altitude, the object remained in sight approximately 7,000 feet traveling in horizontal flight. There was no means of determining the exact size of the object. I was certain the object was not another aircraft but possibly a meteor. The co-pilot and I observed the object and were of the opinion that the object was not a celestial object. We were flying aircraft 5759 about 15 miles east of Yokota Air Base on a heading of 017 at the time of sighting.
