TO: Director,
Office of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force

1. SYNOPSIS: Chief Aircraft Communicator, CAA, Hulman
Municipal Airport, Terre Haute, Indiana, reported to the Office
of Special Investigations agent that on 9 October 1951 at 1342
hours he observed an unknown unidentified aerial object directly
overhead at Hulman Municipal Airport. The object was approximately
the size of a half-dollar coin held at arm's length and was fly-
ing in a southeasterly direction. The dry was clear and informant's
vision was unobstructed. Exact size and altitude of the object
unknown. Informant advised that a pilot, one [illegible]
sighted a similar object on the same date at approximately 1345
hours just east of Paris, Illinois at approximately 5,000 feet.
Object was last seen traveling in a northeasterly direction, south
of the Atomic Energy Plant at Newport, Indiana.

2. DETAILS: Mr. [illegible], Chief Aircraft Communicator, Civil Aero-
nautics Authority, Hulman Municipal Airport, Terre Haute, Indiana,
was interviewed on 12 October 1951 by Special Agent [illegible] Perris,
and stated that he had observed an unknown unidentified aerial object
at 1342 hours, Tuesday, 9 October 1951. The object which is
directly overhead at Hulman Municipal Airport is located approxi-
mately five (5) miles east of Terre Haute, Indiana, on Indiana State Road No. 42. According to [illegible] the object
was approximately the size of a one-half dollar held at arm's length;

120 1-11-109, Subject: UNKNOWN SUBJECT, Unidentified Aerial Object Sighted Over Hulman Municipal Airport, Terre Haute, Indiana, 9 October 1951

Observed no vapor trails; heard no noise and observed no protruding fins or other protrusions on this aerial object. Mr. ■■■■■ stated he observed the object pass from directly over his head to the horizon in approximately fifteen seconds which he considered to be a conservative estimate of time. This day was clear, a bright sun, no clouds or haze, vision was not obstructed by trees or other foliage or buildings and the object traveled over flat terrain; shape and general form of object could still be observed at the thin it disappeared over the horizon. Mr. ■■■■■ stated that he could not estimate the object's size or altitude. According to Mr. Sonner, if this object was 200 feet high, it would have been traveling approximately 2,880 miles per hour and that the speed in miles per hour would increase in proportion to the object's height. Mr. ■■■■■ further stated that either this object or another was sighted by Charles Warren, South Seventh Street, Terre Haute, Indiana, at approximately 1345 hours, Tuesday, 9 October 1951, just east of Paris, Illinois. Warren was flying a private plane at an altitude of 5,000 feet near Paris, Indiana, to Paris, Illinois, and sighted this silver object just east of Paris, Illinois at 5,000 feet. The object appeared to be stationary at 5,000 feet, in such as it did not increase or diminish in size with the approach of the plane. The object then reversed its direction and was last seen travelling in a northeasterly direction south of the Atomic Energy Plant at Newport, Indiana.

length, silver colored with no vapor or exhaust trail and no sound. Propulsion
system unknown, speed estimated up to 280 MPH.

3. Object was sighted visually from the ground and observed to travel a
straight path in a south-easterly direction. Electronic surveillance device

6. Although accurate measurement of the distance between sighting number
one by Mr. _____ and sighting number two by Mr. Warren is not possible from the
information furnished, it appears as though the object could not have been
traveling more than 600 MPH (30 miles from Hulman Airport to Newport) if the
two sightings were of the same object.
