There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old document, specifically a letter from the Air Materiel Command headquarters in Dayton, Ohio, dated March 10, 1950, addressed to someone in Grass Plains, Texas.

The text in the document states:

The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

On Saturday March 4th, 1950 a few minutes before noon C.S.T. 4 objects (4?) were seen to come in from the south over this small city. They remained visible for about 2 seconds. A few minutes after being first observed in a northwest direction, they moved off rapidly. The objects were flat and glittering in color and possibly were some type of aircraft. No noise or exhaust of any kind was seen to do or follow in their wake. Those objects were while to silently in color and probably were a glittering or some type of unusual object. Any other information that could be good to furnish those objects seen would be gladly passed on to you. Very truly yours, [name redacted]
