Dayton, Ohio.                                                March 7, 1950.

Gentlemen:    On Saturday March 4 by 10:10

a few minutes before work C.S.T. a clear star
of lights (4 or 5) were seen to hang in the
sky over this small city, population 2500.
a few minutes after being cited two of these
lights moved off slowly in a south-
easterly direction from Cross Plains. We
they moved slowly then the air one
was seen to do a "barrel Roll"
while the other followed toward in
regular fashion. Those objects were
white to silvery in color and probably
were flat and slipterial in shape.
No noise or exhaust or flame was
cited here from the objects.
Carry other information that could be
passed to science would be glad to furnish
Those objects are locally believed to be
"flying saucers"                    Very truly yours
