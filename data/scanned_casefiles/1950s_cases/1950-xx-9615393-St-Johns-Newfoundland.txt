SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT
31 July 1950

SUBJECT: Unconventional Aircraft sighted in vicinity St. John's, 
Newfld., 30 July 50 by Mr. Roland Hann.

TO: Commander
Military Air Transport Service
Washington 25, D.C.
ATTN: Office of Special Investigation

1. Synopsis:

Various persons in the vicinity of St. John's, Newfoundland
have reported that on the evening of 30 July 50 at approximately
2015 hours, an unconventional aircraft was seen flying over the
area northeast of Pepperrell Air Force Base and St. John's, Newfound-
land. Details described the object as bright and blue and few
minutes indicated it could be established as a star. Consensus of opinion
is that the aircraft did not attain any extraordinary rate of speed
while in sight. Some witnesses indicate that object may have struck
ground in the vicinity of Pepperrell Air Force Base but to date
it has not been found or reported.

2. Details:

On 31 July 50 Mr. R. S. R. Parsons of Kings Road, St. John's, 
Newfld., a resident, was interviewed and reported that at approximately
2012 hours, 30 July 50, I was sitting on 
the top of the hill at the ball park in St. John's with any 3 year old
son. He kept looking toward the buildings in Pepperrell and seeing.
As he looked towards the north east, I saw a strange ob-
ject in the sky near the area of the towers on the far side of the
harbor. At first it looked as though it was moving fast. It was 
a brilliant stream of flame. It was only in sight about three 
or four seconds and was gone. It seemed to appear from behind the
hills. 

AFR, Hfld was interviewed and reported that at approximately 1920 hours 30 
July 50, he was overlooking the hilly, wooded area across the harbor
from Pepperrell Air Force Base. Suddenly, a deep blue glow appeared in the
sky, which lasted for several seconds. It illuminated the area, even though
it was dusky, and then disappeared. AFR, Hfld on 30 July 50 - At approximately 2020 hours, he was outdoors and heard a deep roar or sound, but not as sharp a sound, more 
of a rushing sound, but could not determine the direction from which it came.

Subject: Unconventional Aircraft Observed in vicinity of St. John's, Newfoundland, 30 July 50 
UNCLASS:
Like something hitting the ground. He did not think it was far away. In fact, he crouched and looked around thinking it might be the G.D.'s jeep on the mountain. 
On 31 July 50 at about 0315 hrs, APF. Mrld. was interviewed and reportedthat at about 2015 hours, 30 July 50 he was coming to the base in his car alone "Side wide". And above the hill, behind the base installation. It was approximately 30 to 45 minutes before moonrise. 
On the same night, Capt. Hill, who was on guard duty at about 400 yards traveling toward the ground. The object moved straight towards the ground. At about 450 yards, the object stopped and remained stationary for about 30 seconds. A yellowish green color, the size of a dime at arm's length. The actual size probably 15 to 20 feet in diameter. It then appeared to be a very hot flame and extended approximately 20 to 30 feet. This seemed to explode and then broke into smaller particles and disappeared in the clouds. It was so quick. The speed was too fast to notice changes in the object. It could see no markings. It was traveling at an extremely high rate, low over the ground until it disappeared behind the White Hills. It did not reappear. It made no noise. It appeared down behind the White Hills to the east. It did not appear as the motor but rather from out of the nowhere. He has seen some of the time. 
On 31 July 50 at about 0715, APF. Mrld. was interviewed and reported that at about 2015 hrs, 30 July 50 he saw something that flashed in the sky. It looked like a meteor to him. It was approximately the size of a baseball. It appeared to be falling very fast. It was short and flat, not a long trail or stream. No other life or trail or other visible control surfaces. All he watched, it disappeared. It did not seem to have any apparent control. He could no longer see the object when it disappeared and he received no further information. 
3. Action: Intelligence and Air Force Marshal at Newfoundland Base Command notified 31 July 1950.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

TITLE: Unidential Aircraft
30 JULY 1950, ST. JOHN'S, NFLD.

CHARACTER: Special Inquiry - Unidentical Aircraft 

REFERENCE: AFOSI LTR. 108

SYNOPSIS: Various persons in the vicinity of St. John's, Newfoundland have reported that on 30 July 1950, at approximately 2015 hours, they observed an unidentified aircraft or craft of some kind maneuvering in the sky over this area. Detailed descriptions of the object were varied and for the most part could not be reconciled. Estimates of size, shape, and speed varied widely but the general consensus of opinion was that the aircraft did not attain any extraordinary speed while in flight and may have struck ground or reported in the vicinity of Pepperrell Air Force Base.

DETAILS:
This is a joint investigation of RCAF Newfoundland and USAF.

Mr. [...] of Kings Road, St. John's, Newfoundland was interviewed and stated that approximately 2015 hours, 30 July 1950, while sitting on the top of the hill in his backyard, he observed a strange object in the sky near the town of St. John's. He described it as round in shape, about the size of a house, and giving off a brilliant light. It was moving fast and trailing a brilliant stream of blue-green fire for about two or three feet in diameter. It was visible for approximately 10 seconds.

Lt. Col. _____, Director of Intelligence, Pepperrell AFB, was interviewed and stated, between 2000 and 2030 local time, 30 July 1950, a sighting of an unidentified object at about 50 to 60 degrees angle above the horizon traveling in a northwesterly direction. The object was bright in appearance but was too close (estimated 5 to 8 miles) and too low (estimated 10,000 feet) to make positive identification. The ground at St. John's Object was assumed to have been 8 to 10 miles northwest of the observer's location.

Lt. Col. _____ of Pepperrell AFB, NORAD, was interviewed and stated, at about 2015, 30 July 1950, as aerial sighting of an object that moved southward and disappeared behind the hills near the base. He stated that he was positive it was a meteor, the most beautiful he had ever seen.

M/Sgt _____ of AACS Pepperrell AFB, NORAD, was interviewed and stated, at about 2015, 30 July 1950, he was watching the flashing lights of an aircraft when an object described below came out of the overcast above the base generator. It was approximately 1000 feet in diameter and had a bright red flame. He stated that as it looked like a meteor, it was approximately 1000 feet above the top of the hills at about 45 degrees to the right of the tower at White Hills. The first section appeared to be traveling very fast and then stopped suddenly. The color of the flame was a very hot flame and extended approximately 50 feet behind and was about 10 feet in diameter. I could see no sound. Weather was fairly clear. Flame behind was short and flick-like a long spark or partially out flare. No jet openings or exhaust ports visible. No visible control surfaces. As I watched it, the bright white lights at the base went out all at once. Nothing appeared to fall and I could no longer see the object. I have previously seen meteors but never that close to the ground.

250 l.m.e. It disappeared down behind the White Hills transmitter site. It did not appear to be traveling horizontally but rather dropped down and did not appear as a meteor but rather disappeared as if behind the transmitter site. I have a witness that substantiates this.

Capt. T.F., 2205th Air Base Group, Pepperrell AFB, Nfid. was interviewed and stated that at approximately 2000 hours, 30 July '50, I was coming into Pepperrell AFB, Nfld. from Argentia, Nfld. with my husband. We were both in the town near the base and driving slowly when I saw a streak going across the sky like a lighted torch from the right to the left. It went in a downward direction until it seemed to strike the ground or pass behind a hill in the distance but the way it disappeared into another cloud. It had no effect on the clouds that were present. It was traveling at a terrific speed, or so it seemed. 

Lt. E.J., "St. John's", Newfoundland, was interviewed and gave substantially the same report as his wife. He also stated, I have seen such items before and it is not unusual. I have a civilian friend who is brilliant with a long career in aeronautics and we only saw it through the break. It disappeared behind a cloud.

Capt. J.L. MACS, Pepperrell AFB, Nfld. was interviewed and stated, I was on 1300 hours to 2400 hours at White Hills, transmitter site. Pepperrell AFB, Nfld. on 30 July 50. At approximately 2020 hours the C.O. and I were standing in front of a distance that had a no trespassing sign and I got the impression that it was some more like something hitting the ground. I do not think it was far away. In fact, I arose and looked around thinking it might be the O.D.'s jeep on his routine check but I could see nothing.
