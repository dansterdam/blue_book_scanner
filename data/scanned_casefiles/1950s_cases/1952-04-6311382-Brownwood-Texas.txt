Transcribing the text from the document:

At approximately 6:00 a.m. on 6 April 1952 this unidentified flying object was observed by the undersigned and several other interested parties of this area. The object was observed for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes until it disappeared from view, moving in a southerly direction at high speed.

The object was circular in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and appeared to be metallic in nature. It remained motionless at first, then suddenly accelerated to a high rate of speed, made several abrupt changes in direction, and then continued on a southerly course until it was lost from view.

Text in the document:

On 7 April 1952 at approximately 2330 hours on 2 April 12, 1952 the Control Tower operator at Dyess Air Force Base, Abilene, Texas, reported that a Civil Pilot had reported a "strange lighted object" to him while in the air.

The object was described as a spherical or ball-shaped object, larger than a star, white in color, and emitting a constant white light. It was observed for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, moving at an estimated speed of 200 to 300 knots. The object was observed by the pilot and control tower operator.

In this estimation the speed of the object was approximately 200 to 300 knots. It was possible to determine the elevation and bearing of the object from the information given. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet and on a course of approximately 040 degrees.

April 7, 1952

On the night of April 2, 1952, my wife and I sighted an unidentified object in the sky. Our location was in the Oaklawn drive-in theatre 4 miles northwest of the city of Brownwood, Texas.

While watching the movie, I observed a "flaming object" approaching at a high rate of speed from the southwest. It appeared to be glowing, emitting sparks, and was traveling out of the air and watching it come directly overhead. I was convinced it was a meteor.

The object was flaming yellow in color and the end extended particular orange jets of flame. It was approximately the size of a small airplane and although it was extremely fast, I was able to observe it for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. I observed and watched the object continue on its course and disappear to the northeast.

I am a graduate electrical engineer and I am positive it was no electrical disturbance. The object traveled parallel to the earth's surface and I detected no sound. This further substantiates my opinion that it was not an airplane, nor a meteor. At this point I should like to interject, that even though I can't know what this object was, I am completely convinced it was some form of aircraft, possibly of an unorthodox design, that I have never seen before.

REPORT OF AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT
BROWNWOOD, TEXAS
APRIL 6, 1952
As it was reported to me over the telephone on April 6, 1952, by Captain John T. Fitzpatrick, Air Force Communications, the following incident occurred:
At approximately 2130 hrs, April 5, 1952, a crew of 3 on board a C-47 aircraft (serial number 43-49241) enroute from Dyess AFB, Texas, to Ft Worth, Texas, observed a brilliant light in the sky, seemingly much brighter than the rest of the stars. The light was first observed at approximately 15 miles east of Brownwood, Texas, and continued to be observed until the aircraft was approximately at Brownwood. The light appeared to be stationary. The pilot headed the aircraft in a southeasterly direction to get a closer observation of the light and from the Brownwood area the light still appeared to be stationary. The pilot then climbed the aircraft to 8,000 feet, circled the area several times, and still the light remained stationary. The pilot reported the light remained visible for approximately 30 minutes. After 30 minutes the light diminished in intensity and appeared to fade out gradually. No further observation of the light was made. The crew consisted of the pilot, co-pilot, and flight engineer.
No further details at this time.

2. According to information received, Mr. Newmark first observed the object at approximately 8:10 p.m., CST, on 6 April 1952. The object was described as being white in color with a long, tapered tail. It appeared to be at a high altitude and moving in a north to south direction at a high rate of speed. After observing the object for several minutes, it disappeared from sight.

It was traveling at a high rate of speed.
Its flashed above the clouds, therefore I would say it was about 30,000 feet.
As the time I was it until it disappeared it held the same altitude and its course.

The object was first sighted at approximately 9:58 P.M. CST, on 3 April 1952 by a U. S. Air Force pilot. The object was sighted from the ground to the northeast of Brownwood, Texas, and was observed to be falling or descending at a high rate of speed. The object was described as having a bright white glow, and appeared to be cylindrical in shape. The object was estimated to have been approximately 1000 feet above the ground at the time of initial sighting, and descended to approximately 500 feet above the ground before disappearing from view.

The object was under observation for approximately 1 minute.

This object last part of it's a "light" just a brief moment it was thought to be a plane but it was not and it wasn't clear and in the small space that it was visible for a few seconds it did not have the characteristics of a plane it was not one.

Compared to a plane it moved much faster than any plane. It flashed and went out immediately - There didn't seem to be any jet or exhaust coming from it. It was simply a bright light that appeared and disappeared very rapidly. The time it was visible was estimatedly only about 2 seconds.
