3 April 1952

At my resid'y 3:30-4:20 hrs, 3 April 1952, I was sitting in my living room when the TV was on the Fritz. As I was sitting at the ren, at jepords (?) height to my left, I noticed a strange object in the sky.

The sky was cloudy & filled a sort of (?) hll size of a large watermelon. The object was stationary & seemed to be just hanging in the sky. They may & will describe it as a round object. It was a dull gray color. The position was at about 45° angle from the horizon. It did not move. I watched it for a few seconds.

To: ATIC

I was in the house on the NE-20 at my res at 3:30 hrs. I was sitting at the right angle to the object. The object was stationary. The 12 to 15° on the sky was clear. I could see the fire or mist on top. From 15, 20 first time I saw it. I was able to see it with 20. I would say it's approximately 30 ft. I would say it was just about direct over my house. It was a round object.

REPORT
OF
SIGHTING

At approximately 2000 hours on 3 April 1952, the 7353d Air Support Group's teletype on the Chief Army Controller at Fort Bliss, Texas, just at an "all out" message, who was at an entrance to the area when he saw an object a few feet above the ground, slightly dir and just maneuvering. For some ten (10) seconds he did so at which time he disappeared instantly, to reappear.

In his estimation the object left a trail of fire, approximately three (3) or four (4) seconds long, which was evidenced by an increase in the trail of fire, brighter, more scintillating. Then along his flight path at a slight glide.

In his estimation the speed of the object was between 1000-1200 miles per hour, actually after the message. It was possible to hear it. The sound was the same as given off by a jet aircraft at high altitude. The object was witnessed by Lt. Alward, Sgt. Carey and Poe, Sarnette.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Intelligence Office
Bryan AFB, Texas

REPORT NO. IR-2-52    PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. At approximately 2040 hours local time on 2 April 1952 an unidentified flying object was sighted by three (3) flight line observers southwest of Bryan AFB, Texas. One observer was on the ground, one observer was in the control tower, and one observer was at 1200 ft. indicated over the north-south runway on a heading of 170° in a T-28 type aircraft preparatory to pitching out for landing.

2. The object was described as a ball of fire with a long trail behind it. The ball was estimated in size to be about one-half (1/2) the size of the moon. The trail was described as being composed of sparks and as being fifteen to thirty (15-30) feet long as the diameter of the ball. The trail was thickest at the forward end.

3. The ground observer stated that two (2) small trails dropped toward the ground at the same time in different areas approximately 100-200 feet in length. The other two (2) observers did not make the same observations.

4. The color of the trail was described as pale orange white fire colored. All observers agreed that there was only one object.

5. Estimates of the speed vary from 1000 mph to 1500 mph with the propulsion system unknown. None of the observers report hearing any sound from the object.

6. The object was first seen to the southwest of Bryan AFB at an undetermined distance and altitude. It ran a straight and level path toward the northeast, where it passed from sight normally. It was observed for periods ranging from five to fifteen seconds by the three (3) observers.

7. The three observers were all Captains in the USAF with considerable flying experience. They gave the appearance of serious minded individuals who were not inclined to exaggerate and were considered usually reliable.

8. The weather sequence at 20280, 2 April 1952 at Bryan AFB, Texas, was as follows: 25,000' scattered, 12 miles visibility, 1016.2 mb, temperature 67°F, dewpoint 48°, wind south at 8 kts, altimeter 30.00", total sky cover 2/10 cirrus. There was no weather phenomenon at the time of the sighting.

9. The sources of this information are rated 3-1. Due to the small amount of information available on this sighting no significance can be attached at this level.

PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

The shape of the object was rectangular with blunted ends and small trailing tail of sparks and flame. There was no sound at all. It preceded in a straight course at an approximately 90° angle on a northeasterly course. The object was of a fiery nature and bright orange and yellow in color.

Through visual observation it was sighted at approximately 2005, 2 April 1952. The object was flying at an approximate 2000 ft. altitude. If approximation of altitude is near correct, speed of the object was over six hundred (600) miles per hour.

The observer was located at 31°, 55' north, 97°, 05', 30" west. Ennis is the location of the observation in Texas, near Waco, Texas and is on the Dallas Highway #81.

The 309th Flew over the observer's [redacted] head at an estimated 2000 ft. altitude, flying away from him on a northeasterly heading, disappearing from his visual area 3 miles south of same Cannon Air Force Base.

The observers were Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] with Mr. [redacted] reporting it first.

Mrs. [redacted], a civilian instructor in the Radar Observer School of the 3555th Training Wing at James Connally Air Force Base, Waco, Texas and is a graduate electrical engineer. The reliability of his statement can be estimated as fairly substantial.

The weather was as follows: scattered clouds at 12,000 ft., scattered clouds at 25,000 ft. 15 miles visibility with a south-southeast, 8 MPH wind. The temperature was 68° and the dew point 58°.

In far as can be determined there were no unusual meteorological conditions or activities at that time.

There is no physical evidence of the sighting in existence other than the written and signed statement of Mr. [redacted] pertaining to his observation.

STATEMENT

On the night of April 2, 1952, my wife and I sighted an unidentified object in the sky. Our location was at the Oaklawn Drive-in theatre a few miles northeast of the city of Waco on the Dallas highway # 81.

While watching the movie we observed a flaming object approaching over our heads from the southwest. I thought, at first, that this object was a jet aircraft, but after getting out of the car and watching it come directly overhead I was convinced it was not.

The object was flaming yellow in color and its end emitted particles or sparks. It was absolutely noiseless and had no landing lights. It traveled at a uniform speed while in my sight and although it was impossible to tell its exact speed (not having the site) I believe at its altitude, approximately 1,000 ft. (rough measurement of distance) that it took the object 20 seconds to travel from (noted northeast) the edge of Waco, to a point about 8 miles south of JCAB3. It first though was a jet, if it were a jet, its altitude was about 22,000 ft. The object traveled parallel to the earth's surface and I detected no change in altitude. It held a straight course until it disappeared from my sight.

The sky was clear that night and except for a couple small clouds south of us the stars were clearly visible.

My wife and I both observed this object and to my knowledge so did several others at the drive-in. Unfortunately I failed to get their names.

At this point I should like to interject, that even though I don't know what this object was a fairly positive it was not an aircraft. (Nothing so far as I know has been just about every model the Air Force has with the exception of the secret experimental models). Said it been a jet (and as far as I know jets don't have) I was long or as long I would have heard some sound. At the lights of some sort I was standing out of the car when the object came from overhead and was clear or the movie loudspeaker (which may be argued as a factor in creating the sound) I have attended many times in located some what southeast of JCAB3 runways and night flying B-25's fly over all the time sometimes drowning out the movie sound. This further substantiates my belief that it was not an aircraft.

I am a graduate electrical engineer and I am positive it was no electrical disturbance such as lightning, etc.

it was 8:08 on 11:30 or 8 Apr 52 I saw, what appeared to be a ball of fire moving on the horizon from the south-west descending on the horizon to the earth. I have no idea whatever this ability or ball-over 1000 miles/hr.

was no idea what the object was. I can describe it as follows: a small ball of fire two or three smaller balls of fire moving in a sort of arc over the horizon. Could at a distance apparently over my position, relatively stationary. I know no idea the size of it, I can not even venture an estimate of the height.

The 11 a lapse observed for this photo event was an estimated 5 seconds.

I John W. Morris says, Air Force, AO 1337062, at 2042 hrs, at the 2nd of April last at Tarpley Texas was on duty in this area. It was nothing, very faintly, very low altitude, with a long trail. It was in sight, for about a second and in this at small parts were falling. off. Its path was from Southwest to Northeast. Not knowing the size of the object, I can not say how high it was.

8 April 1952

When returning from a Special Service Ch w on the night of 2 April 1952 at approximately 2040 hours, I noticed in the sky what appeared to be a "falling star". I was watching: this because of the length of it as it rolled in view, during the climb. Area approximately 10 to 15° (2) path fall. Could this, they had trails of it & but not as large as the first one. I estimate the object (this large one) stayed in sight for 20 secs duration.

To the best of my knowledge this is correct.

From Wing "ill" Airport
Topeka, Texas
April 3, 1952

At approximately 2015 on 2 April an unknown object was observed moving from South to North across "ill" Airport. Elevation of the object was approximately 10,000 feet. It was in plain sight for a period of about 10 acres traveling in a straight line, then changing course, taking no 2 thin stratus or cirrus clouds, speed is estimated to be in excess of 1,200 mph.

The object appeared to have a glow or exhaust following, its giving the impression of a trail. The object was off a pure white glow. No sound was heard at the time of the object.

In this time the object traveled in a straight line within no loss of altitude. I do not believe it would have been a meteor.

3 April 1952

On the night of 2-3 April 1952 at approximately 2015 hours I saw an object in the sky moving: from S North, how 'N' North. This object appeared as follows:

a. It appeared to be a ball of fire shooting red flame from its tail section.

b. It was traveling at a high rate of speed.

c. It disappeared above the clouds, therefore I would say it was about 10,920 feet.

d. From the time I was it until it disappeared it told the same altitude and its course.

AF:134-143

Hq USAF Alton Airport
To: DCS/W
April 3, 1952

On 2 April 1952 at approximately 2040 hours at Hawn News Alton Airport, the meteorological observer on duty noticed an object moving through the air in the vicinity. It's estimated the object was moving at a speed of 1500 MPH or better and was not an aircraft. It was observed for approximately 20-25 seconds. All could be seen was a streak of fire as it traveled at intervals to form what seemed to be a course. (Object appeared to maintain a travel of 45 degrees) There was no sound as all observed.

About 2120 hours on 2 April I was talking to Lt. Col. Thompson building to called my attention to an object in the sky. I noticed a manner to be a moving, traveling at a very high rate of speed in a northerly direction. It appeared as a small of fire moving, a small of 12 to 15 inches long and finally changed its course. It was traveling in a spiral 2 to 3 lines.

A ball of fire with a tail crossed heavens from South to North as I recall it. At 1/3 of its course 3 individual falls: 1/3 falls upon from point to point. Estimated time on 12, 1st estimated on an area about 3 miles in length. Will be noted in view.

The document appears to be a UFO sighting report from Hawn News Alton Airport on April 2, 1952, describing multiple observations of a fast-moving, fiery object in the sky.

I could not estimate its altitude or speed it seemed to me to be a

3 April 1952
AF 134443

I hereby state the following is a true statement or my revision:

At approx. 2200 hours on 3 April 1952 at Col Stanley from and I were on the west end of the range at rough - Hill Air Force Base. While driving on west out a hill or a ridge about 8,000 feet altitude, I first noticed a light which appeared to be a fixed point. This object, from our observation, was stationary and seemed to be at an altitude estimated to be 10,000 ft and continued out of sight over a bank of our hills about on the northwest horizon. The object was stationary and was under my observation from 1 to 2 minutes. The sound was emitted from this object. In my estimation this object traveled at a speed less than a Jet aircraft.
