Observer was interviewed with the following results:

Observer was housewife. Sighting was made from residence yard which is 31 blocks south of city center. Observer stated, "When we hear the 'special drone' of the B-36's as they cross over Kansas City on their scheduled route, we usually take our binoculars and go out to watch then." "Sometimes," she continued, "they leave 'trails' behind them." On this date, 20 February 1952, she looked long trail as it passed from east to west across the city at a high altitude.

The object first was sighted south of city near east-west trail, third of the way back along the visible trail (above West side of city). When first sighted it appeared to be north of the trail, during observation period it drifted slightly east of trail and generally lost altitude. It was not lost from sight while crossing trail so was assumed to pass beneath it. Was clear sunny and bright. Object appeared round - no wings visible. It seemed to hang and float like a "long-range" star. It appeared bright, but not too bright. Look at. During 10-minute period it drifted over city to South of city in a path passing overhead of observer's post. Observer stopped into house for few minutes and object disappeared during this interim.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. Binoculars used were 6 x 30.
2. Weather was bright sunshine. (25,000 Scattered)
3. Weather records indicate that the winds from 10,000 to 30,000 feet were conducive to southeastward movement of a free floating object at speeds varying from 30 to 55 knots.
4. Size of object was described as appearing smaller, but nearly the same size as tail of bomber. Object could be seen with naked eye.
5. RADAR observations at both Fairfax and Fort Leavenworth could provide basis for sighting due to timing and wind conditions.

APPENDIX III
Kansas City, Missouri - 11 February 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 11 February 1952, between 1:05 and 1215 CST the source, a civilian woman, was watching a B-36 fly from East to West over Kansas City. While watching the B-36, she noticed a round bright object just north of the vapor trail left by the aircraft. The object was observed for ten minutes through 6 x 30 binoculars and during this period it drifted over the observer and continued south of Kansas City.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Two balloons were launched in the general area prior to the time of sighting. A pitfall balloon was launched from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, at 0930 CST and a Rawinsonde balloon was launched from Fairfax Airport, Kansas City, at 1130 CST. It is doubtful if the balloon launched at 0930 would be in the area at 1205 CST as they usually burst within an hour after the launching.

The balloon launched at 1130 CST could have been observed, however. In the 35 minutes between the time of the balloon launch and the observation, the balloon would have ascended to approximately 30,000 feet and would have traveled approximately 15 miles. (The wind was from 315Â° and averaged about 30 knots.) This would mean that the balloon passed near the source. If some allowance is made for an error in time, it is very possible that the balloon could have passed directly over the observer. (See enclosed overlay.)

The fact that it could be observed at 30,000 ft. is probably due to the fact that the sun caused the balloon to glow.

III. CONCLUSIONS
The object observed by the source was very possibly a Rawinsonde balloon launched from Fairfax Airport.

SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Radar Returns (27 May 1953)

THRU ATIAR-2    FROM ATIAR-5    DATE 3 June 53    COMMENT NO. 2
                                 No. A/46-99/1ay
                                 693CW/46 263A

1. The incident reported was happening at Granite City, Illinois, 13 Feb 52, cannot
be firmly evaluated. However, since the target's appearance to us meant that the radar
tracking equipment was switched to an expanded scale for a 25 second period, it appears
very likely that there was some malfunctioning of the radar, although the report states
that immediate checks of the RWS equipment determined that the tracking was
operating normally. It is very doubtful that additional data obtained at this late date
would be of value in evaluating this target unless similar happenings have been experienced since 13 Feb 52.

2. The radar data contained in the report from Carswell AFB, dated 13 Feb 53, is
not sufficient for analysis purposes. For instance, there is no indication that the
targets observed on the APS-41 radar were moving targets. The weather data submitted
indicates that there was a temperature inversion and a moisture lapse at about the time
of the incident. This weather condition could cause radar clutter at greater heights to
appear above the horizon, although the report states that a check indicated that no
ground return signals were received.

3. The following information is in reply to paragraph 4 of Comment No. 1:

"The properties of the atmosphere which determine the refractive index (bending)
and which change with height are temperature, pressure, and moisture content.

"Excessive refraction occurs when there is a rapid decrease of moisture with
height (moisture lapse) and, to a lesser degree, when there is a rapid increase of
temperature with height (temperature inversion). The most pronounced cases of excessive
refraction occur when both of these conditions prevail at the same time."

1. Enclosed are two sightings of unidentified aerial objects which Project Blue Book requests you review for a possible explanation.

2. The first, 13 Feb 52, Granite City, Illinois, concerns a seemingly conventional target painted by an automatic tracking device which eventually reaches the unconventional spread of 1000 mph. In this instance there is some confusion on whether the target was picked up by air radar or not. Weather information to determine the presence of a possible inversion layer was requested but unfortunately not forwarded by Asheville.

3. The second sighting took place at Carswell AFB on 13 Feb 53. Project Blue Book believes that the visual and radar sightings may be explained by a/c and ground clutter respectively, just happening to be coincident.

4. As an item of general interest Blue Book would like to know if a moisture inversion can effect a radar as a temperature inversion often does.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Our regulations in this and succeeding paragraph. List references in lower left. Digest text of report on AF Form 1-2âPart II.)

1. At 15452, 12 February 1952, Captain William T. Burke, pilot of MATS aircraft #9105 on route to Midway from Haneda, Japan flying at 9,000 feet on 100Â° course, sighted an unidentified aircraft 9,500N-159Â°10'E, altitude approximately 9,500 feet, heading 120Â°, speed approximately 200 mph.

2. The unidentified aircraft flew from 1,000 to 1,500 feet to the right of the MATS aircraft and turned across its' course, taking up a course of 360Â°.

3. The pilot and navigator of the MATS aircraft observed the unidentified aircraft for about five minutes. The only identification feature observed was the spacing of the running lights which indicated that it was a medium-sized aircraft of the B-29 or C-54 type. No attempt to communicate with the unidentified aircraft was made. The sighting was made in clear weather with visibility only limited only by darkness.

4. The Intelligence Officer, Pacific Division, MATS stated that further check with CAA revealed the possibility that three friendly aircraft were in the vicinity at the time of the sighting but 1st Lt. Hal Dellard that same aircraft were not at the same altitude or within sighting distance of the MATS aircraft. Personnel of the 57th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, Hickam AF Base, T. H. indicated the possibility of a weather reconnaissance aircraft from Japan flying weather missions to the area of the reported unidentified aircraft.

Comments of Preparing Officer:
The weather Reconnaissance tracks in the Pacific area were checked at Hq, Air Weather Service. None of these tracks extends to the area in which the unidentified aircraft was observed. The possibility that the unidentified aircraft was being flown on a USAF weather reconnaissance mission can be discounted.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unusual Sighting in Atlantic Ocean

7 March 1952
Charles J. Fowley, Captain, USAF

1. The security officer of Headquarters Azores Air Transport Station reported that at 0215Z, 23 February 1952, Captain William S. Treacy, pilot of a MATS R-aircraft on route from Fort Lyautey, French Morocco to Lisbon, Portugal, observed a bright flash at an estimated distance of 30 miles directly ahead or the aircraft and at approximately the same altitude. Two aircraft were on a heading of 343 degrees, altitude 8,500 ft. and flying on the top of a cloud formation. Lights and lens were observed through the clouds for a right of the aircraft at the time of the sighting. Captain Treacy did not know the exact position of the aircraft at this time. The Security Officer, but estimated the plane's position as 36 degrees, 50 minutes North and 8 degrees, 50 minutes West.

2. At approximately 0232 another flash at the same altitude as the plane was observed, this one being 45 degrees to the right of the plane. This flash was much closer than the first one observed. Finally, at approximately 0231Z a white flash was observed off the right wing tip approximately one mile away. All of the flashes were reported as being instantaneous and of very high intensity. The second and third flash occurred at 2-minute intervals. No other flashes were reported after the one at 0231Z.
