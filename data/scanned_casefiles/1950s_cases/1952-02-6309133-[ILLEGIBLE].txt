AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
D/T CASE 112-52-1 
PAGE 2 OF 2

Observer was interviewed with the following results:
Observer was housewife. Sighting was made from residence and which of 31 December 1951 while investigating unusual lights in the sky. Several "special drones" of the P-51's as they crossed over Kansas City were tentatively identified. Comment was also made that the objects were not like jets and at times "no wings showed". The sighting lasted about 15-20 minutes.

CONTENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. Binoculars used were 6 x 30.
2. Weather was bright sunshine. (25,000 Scattered)
3. According to observer, what the winds were as per 18000 foot were "conductive to Southeastward movement by 25 knots" as opposed to movement at ground level
4. Size of object was described as appearing smaller, but nearly the same size as full of bomber. Object could be seen with naked eye.
5. FAVUI observations at both Fairfax and Port Leavenworth could provide basic log sighting due to timing and wind conditions.

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 11 February 1952, between 1305 and 1315 CST, the source, a civilian woman, was checking a flight plan list at an airfield near Kansas City, Missouri, when she observed a strange object in the sky. The object was observed for ten minutes through 6 x 30 binoculars and during this period it remained stationary over the observer and contained south of Kansas City.

II. FACTS OF INVESTIGATION
A pibill balloon was launched from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, at 0930 CST and it is doubtful if the balloon launched at 0920 would be in the area at 1305 CST as they usually burst within the area at 1305 CST.
The balloon launched at 1130 CST could have been observed, however. In the 35 minutes between the time of 1130 CST balloon launching and the observation, the balloon would have ascended to approximately 30,000 feet and would have traveled approximately 15 miles. (The wind was from 3150 at approximately 30 knots.) This would mean that the balloon passed near the source, if some allowance is made for an error in timing, it is very possible that the balloon could have passed directly over the observer.

III. CONCLUSION:
The object observed by the source was very possibly a rawindsonde balloon launched from Fairfax Airport.

SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Radar Returns 
TRAIL ATTAR
XG-AATAD-5 	     FROM:  ATIAC-P 	     DATE: 3 June 53    COMMENT NO. 2

1. The incident reported as happening at Granite City, Illinois, 13 Feb 53, cannot be verified by further investigation. However, it appears that there was some malfunction of the radar equipment, and that the signals obtained were not produced by any airborne object. It is very likely that there was some malfunctioning of the radar, although the report indicates that the signals were not operating normally. It is very doubtful that additional data obtained at this late date would be of value in establishing a valid explanation, since 13 Feb 53.

2. The radar data contained in the report from Carwell AFB, dated 13 Feb 53, is not sufficient for analysis purposes. For instance, there is no indication that the target observed on this radar was moving target, and it indicates that there was no temperature inversion and moisture lapse evident above the horizon, although the report stated that a check indicated that no definite indication of a temperature inversion existed.

3. The following information is in reply to paragraph 4 of Comment No. 1:

"The properties of the atmosphere which determine the refractive index (bending) and which change with height are temperature, pressure, and moisture content. 

"Excessive refraction occurs when there is a rapid decrease of moisture with height (moisture lapse) and to a lesser degree when there is temperature inversion. These conditions account for an increase of refraction which results in a rapid increase of elevation of the radar target with height (temperature inversion). The most pronounced cases of excessive refraction occur when both of these conditions prevail at the same time."

1. Enclosed are two sightings of unidentified aerial objects which Project Blue Book requests you review for a possible explanation.

2. The first, 13 Feb 52, Granite City, Illinois, concerns a seemingly conventional target painted by an automatic tracking device which eventually reaches the maximum instrumental speed of 1050 mph. In this instance there is some confusion as to whether or not a temperature inversion layer was requested but unfortunately no information on this was obtained.

3. The second sighting took place at Cariswell AFB on 13 Feb 53. Project Blue Book believes that the visual and radar sighting may be explained by a/c and ground clutter respectively, just happening to be co-incident.

4. As an item of general interest Blue Book would like to know if a moisture inversion can effect a radar as a temperature inversion often does.

UNIDHNHFIED FLYING OBJECTS
32/1352
KIRTIANB AFB, N. MEX.
3/31/52
INFORMATION

This object was observed at about 6 p.m. on the above date by a radar observer at the 384th Fighter-Bomber wing, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico.

The object was observed for approximately 20 minutes. It was described as a bright, glowing object, cigar-shaped, and estimated to be about 60 feet long. It was observed to be at an altitude estimated at 30,000 feet, and it appeared to be going at a speed estimated at 500 mph.

The object was observed to make a sudden change in direction, from north to east, and then disappear from view. This was observed through high power binoculars.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Unidentified Aircraft Sighted Between Midway Island and Japan
3 March 1952

SUMMARY: (Censored) the unidentified aircraft was observed at an altitude of approximately 9,500 feet, heading 120°, speed approximately 200 mph. The unidentified aircraft flew from 1,000 feet to the right of the MATS aircraft and turned across its course, taking up a course of 360°.

The pilot and navigator of the MATS aircraft observed the unidentified aircraft and made an attempt to communicate with the unidentified aircraft, but no attempt to communicate with the unidentified aircraft was successful. The Intelligence Officer, Pacific Division, MATS stated that further check into the incident was unnecessary at the time of the writing as it is believed that MATS aircraft were not the targets of the unidentified aircraft.

Comments of Reporting Officer: The weather reconnaissance tracks in the Pacific area were checked at Hq. MATS. None of the reconnaissance flights were in the vicinity at the time the unidentified aircraft was being flown on a USAF weather reconnaissance mission can be discounted.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 15 April 1952
PLACE OF OBSERVATION: Western Pacific Ocean
DETAILS: 
1. A delayed report, received from the Intelligence Officer, 1500th Air Base Wing, Wheeler Air Force Base, T.H., reports that on 15 February 1952, a MATS (VR-3) aircraft, enroute from Travis Air Force Base to Hickam AFB, T.H., sighted an unidentified object. The pilot reported that at 0925 Hawaii time, his aircraft, while cruising at 13,500 feet, sighted a bright metallic object, circular in shape, and estimated to be approximately 40 feet in diameter. This object was observed for approximately 12 to 15 seconds and then disappeared at a very high rate of speed. The pilot stated that the aircraft was at an altitude of 13,500 feet and the object appeared to pass over the aircraft and climb out of sight at a tremendous rate of speed, estimated to be in excess of 3,000 feet per second. The pilot further stated that the incident was witnessed by the navigator and the flight engineer.

2. No other descriptive data was furnished this headquarters, and it is considered that the sighting may have been of a conventional nature. The drawing was reported to be tentatively of the opinion that the incident may have been of celestial origin.

The object was traveling at an estimated speed of 1500-2000 mph. Captain Tracey did not know the exact duration of the sighting. Captain Tracey did not attempt to obtain further information or to take any evasive action. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds, 50 miles North and 4 degrees East.

WAS OBSERVED AGAIN AT 0231Z. A second flash was observed approximately 100-125 miles ahead and again off the port bow of the aircraft. This second flash was observed for only a few seconds. No further observations were made.
