SUMMARY:

a. At approximately 2152 CST, 18 September 1950, an unidentified aerial object was observed over Tinker AFB, near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The object was sighted by S Sgt Randall D. Fowler of the Intelligence Section of the 513th Reconnaissance Sq, (VLR) Weather, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

b. When first sighted the aerial object appeared to be at a position of approximately 3 to 4,000 feet over Tinker AFB, moving to the northwest at a speed estimated to be from 300 to 1,000 MPH. In appearance the object resembled an elliptical area of amber colored light approximately 25 feet in diameter but without definitely discernible edges.

c. As the object passed directly above the observer, in its northwesterly flight, there appeared to be jerky disordered movements. The object was observed for approximately 3 minutes and when last seen it appeared to be at about 10,000 feet continuing to ascend into the northwest.

d. Clear skies up to 25,000 feet were reported at the time of the observation.

e. A check of local air installations on the following morning revealed that no local aircraft were known to be aloft at the time of the observation.
