COMMENTS OF Preparing Officer:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was caused by a meteorite for the following reasons:
a. The direction of the sighting from the various reporting points all vector in towards the Humboldt-Beatrice area. The reporting times are all within this time interval for the arrival of a now non-existing phenomenon.
b. The three actual sources all to one degree or another, suggested by themselves that the object was a meteorite.
c. The descriptions of the object, together with its short observation period and characteristic downward trajectory suggests it was a meteorte of unusual size.
d. The collective professional opinion of Dr. Schultz, Professor Collins and Dr. Lincoln La Paz, leads to the conclusion that it was rather to be a meteorite than anything else.
e. The fact that the Red Oak and Kansas City observers thought the object burned out, while in Nebraska they believed it struck the earth can be explained. The difference in the horizontal distance of the observers from the phenomenon would result in this difference of visual conclusions. This phenomenon is relative to the observers when the meteorite went past the horizon it would look to be burning out, yet the observers in closer proximity could rightly conclude it struck the earth.
The possibility of an aircraft crash was investigated. The CAA at Kansas City, Missouri had no word of any crashes in this area.

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting described in the above report was caused by a meteorite. It is the further opinion of this headquarters that the sighting was of solid type, accounting for the explosion heard in Humboldt, Nebraska.

REPORT NO.: PAGE 2 OF 6 PAGES
I. SOURCE:
Address: Red Oak, Iowa
Age: 15
Occupation: High School student
Education: 10th grade
Qualifications: Substitute GOC observer with little training.
II. RELIABILITY: The source was sincere and did not appear to exaggerate. He was uncertain in reporting the sight, and we cannot give opinions of which he was not 100% certain.
III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: The long object appeared suddenly in the SW and glowed like a sky rocket. You see on the 4th of July for about fifteen seconds, while it had no particular shape, it was about the size of an automobile headlight. The source thought the object was about one block away from him. The path traveled by the sighting was almost straight downward towards the earth.
The object changed color from blue to white to red and then seemed to slowly burn itself out. At first it appeared solid but later turned transparent.
There were scattered clouds, many stars and a slight breeze when the incident occurred at 19:22 CET, according to the source.
Source called his GOC filter center and reported the object. No photographs were taken. If it were not for the size of the object and its apparent nearness, source stated the sighting might have been a falling star.
Source stated that his mother who was on duty with him 'agreed with his description.

It was tracked on radar by a GCI station and also observed visually by a Kansas City, Missouri (CECTRE MIKE 2524) control tower operator. The object appeared to be of the size of a C-47 aircraft and was traveling at a speed estimated between 400 to 600 MPH.

II. RELIABILITY: Source offered little information on his own, answered only the questions put directly to him. Investigator considered him the source for an article which appeared in the Kansas City Star of 18 December 55. Source was evidently one of the persons quoted in that story. 

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Object flared up in the WNW of the tower about 18/30/1952 Dec 55. It was of unusual brightness; it was source "took it for granted that the sighting was a falling star." It seemed to him that it burned out before reaching the horizon.

Source turned in no report of the incident, but did talk about it with "several" air traffic control people regarding its unusual brightness. 

Source stated the object fell almost straight down.

I. SOURCE: Captain
Address: Kansas City, Missouri 
Age: Adult
Occupation: Captain with Braniff International Airlines
Education: College graduate. Taught physics at the University of Iowa for a period of time.

II. RELIABILITY: The investigators were able to reach the Captain himself as he was out of the state on business. However, his co-pilot, who was flying with the Captain, related the incidents to the investigators. The co-pilot had taken informed notes of the events.

III. SOURCE DESCRIPTION: While flying at about 3,000 feet two miles south of the Kansas City Municipal Airport, a large "greenish-colored" object appeared according to the Captain. The object remained in sight for about 5 minutes. The Captain quickly realized that the sighting was not some distant inbound aircraft. 

The source watched the object for about 10 seconds and told the co-pilot that it was a "nickle-sized" light, rapidly changing colors, and it seemed to be revolving. The object appeared to be slightly smaller than a basketball.

Upon landing the two flyers talked about the unusual sighting to their friends who had seen it from the ground.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A call to the University of Kansas at Kansas City, Kansas revealed that this institution had no astronomer and that no information relative to the unknown could be obtained from this source.

2. The Kansas City Weather Bureau had no information on the object. The weather as of 12/22/54 was: Kansas City, Missouri - Clear; Visibility, 12 miles; Temperature, 20°; Dew Point, 14°; and Wind: N at 7 knots.

3. The Flying Safety Office of the CAA had no information on the unknown sighting.

4. A call was made to the Kansas City Star to find out the source of their brief story of 12 December 55 stating that a meteorite had been seen over the area. The investigation learned that this story had appeared in the early morning white at the Control Tower at the Municipal Airport.

5. A contact with the Municipal Airport gave us CAA employee, Mr. White who had seen the object and became another source, but he could not positively identify the object while he had seen it. 

6. By following a lead mentioned in the TT from 31st AD (Def) contact was made with Captain Cororan and his description of the sighting.

7. Again by chasing down a lead from the TT from 31st AD (Def), contact was made via telephone with the city editor of the Lincoln Nebraska Journal or Lincoln, Nebraska concerning further details of information which was reported over telephone as a result of the initial report from a known military readman of the Burlington Line that such notices were reported by an unknown railroad yardman of the Burlington Line working at Burlington, Iowa.

8. Telephone contact was established with Dr. Schultz, who is the Director of the University of Nebraska, who in turn confirmed that Dr. C. E. Schultz of the University of Nebraska was working on the subject and was a knowledgeable person in this field.

The University of Nebraska confirmed that this information from all reports which he received, and from consultations with Professor Gallion of that school's Astronomy Department, that the three of them had decided the object was definitely a meteorite. They further stated that while the sighting was undoubtedly authentic, the findings indicated that the object was a high altitude natural phenomenon and not due to an unknown or unidentified flying object.

Unknown objects they were plotting with the sane description were from Kansas City, Missouri and from Red Oak, Iowa. The time of occurrence coincided with those reports which had been received, and we ourselves were talking of the same object.
