AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From: Det. 2, 4602d AISS
Report No. D2-UFOB-3-55
Date: 2, Part Five, Page 6 of 6 Pages

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was caused by a meteorite for the following reasons:

a. The direction of the sighting from the various reporting points all vector in toward the Humboldt-Beatrice area. The reporting times are all within the margin of human error, thus they may be considered the same. The descriptions are similar in content. Thus it can be reasonably assumed that all three sources saw the same object, and that it is the object D. G. Schultz investigated.

b. The three actual sources all to one degree or another, suggested by themselves that the object was a meteorite.

c. The descriptions of the object, together with its short observation period and its characteristic downward trajectory suggests it was a meteorite of unusual size.

d. The collective professional opinion of Dr. Schultz, Professor Collins and Dr. Lincoln La Paz is not to be taken lightly. This is especially true when supported by the actual sources plus the circumstances surrounding the object.

e. The fact that the Red Oak and Kansas City observers thought the object burned out, while in Nebraska they believed it saw it continued as a haze in Nebraska is known to affect observations near the horizon as is typical with the "loss" of stars near the horizon on even clear nights. Since the horizon is relative to the observers, when the meteorite went past the horizon it would look to the eastern observers as though it suddenly grew dim and then blackened out. Yet to the western observers the meteorite did not pass the horizon and through the haze, thus, the observers there saw a different view.

f. The possibility of an aircraft crash was investigated. The CAA at Kansas City, Missouri had no word of any crashes in the area in question.

g. The one feature of the sighting which is unusual to the layman is the brightness of the object and the reported explosion at Humboldt. However, Dr. Schultz has not surprised at the occurrence of an explosion nor the greater than average illumination.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting described in the above report was caused by a meteorite. It is the further opinion of this headquarters that the meteorite was of bolide type, accounting for the explosion heard in Humboldt, Nebraska.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Last, First): Det. 2, 4602d AISS                    REPORT NO.    D2-UFOB-3-55        Part One    PAGE    2    OF    6    PAGES

I. SOURCE:
Address: [redacted] Red Oak, Iowa
Ages: 15
Occupation: High School student
Education: 10th grade
Qualifications: Substitute GOC observer with little training.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was sincere and did not appear to exaggerate. He was interested in reporting "just the facts" and would not give opinions of which he was not 100% certain.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: The lone object appeared suddenly in the SW and glowed "like a sky rocket you see on the 4th of July" for about fifteen seconds. While it had no particular shape, it was about the size of an automobile headlight. The source thought the object was about one block away from him. The path traveled by the sighting was almost straight downward towards the earth.

The object changed colors from blue to white to red and then seemed to slowly burn itself out. At first it appeared solid but later turned transparent.

There were scattered clouds, many stars and a slight breeze when the incident occurred at 19:22 CST, according to the source. (18/0122 Dec 55).

Source called his GOC filter center and reported the object. No photographs were taken. If it were not for the size of the object and its apparent nearness, source stated the sighting might have been a falling star.

Source stated that his mother who was on duty with him, agreed with his description.

II. RELIABILITY: Source offered little information on his own, answered only the questions put directly to him. Investigators contacted him since he was the source for an article which appeared in the Kansas City Star of 18 December 55. Source was friendly and seemed sincere.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Object flared up in the NNW of the tower about 18/0129 Dec 55. It was of unusual brightness, yet source took for granted that the sighting was a falling star. It seemed to him that it burned out before reaching the surface of the earth.

Source turned in no report of the incident, but did talk about it with "several" air line pilots regarding its unusual brightness.

Source stated the object fall almost straight down.

I. SOURCE: Captain (Redacted)
Address: (Redacted) Kansas City, Missouri
Age: Adult
Occupation: Captain with Braniff International Airlines
Education: College graduate. Taught physics at the University of Iowa for a period of time.

II. RELIABILITY: The investigators were not able to reach the Captain himself as he was out of the state on business. However his co-pilot, (Redacted), who was flying with the Captain related the incident to the investigators. The co-pilot had taken informal notes of the event.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: While flying at about 3,000 feet two miles south of the Kansas City Municipal Airport, a large "greenish colored" object appeared to the WNW at 18/0122Z Dec 55. During the first instant the source states that they had a tendency to duck as the object seemed so near. However the source quickly realized that the object was some distance away. He then informed the passengers of the object.

The source watched the object for about 10 seconds and told the co-pilot that it was a "nickel meteorite" because of its greenish cast. The object appeared to burn itself out before reaching the ground.

Upon landing the two flyers talked about the unusual sighting to their friends who had seen it from the ground.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:

1. A call to the University of Kansas at Kansas City, Kansas revealed that this institution had no astronomer and that no information relative to the unknown could be obtained from this source.

2. The Kansas City Weather Bureau had no information on the object. The weather as of 18/0130Z Dec 55 for the areas where sightings took place was as follows:

    a. Kansas City, Missouri. Glenn: Visibility, 12 miles; Temperature, 20°; Dew Point, 14°; and Wind, N at 7 knots.

    b. Omaha, Nebraska (SECRET FJN 0517), (nearest weather to Red Oak, Iowa). Ceiling, 14,000 scattered; Visibility, 9 miles; Temperature, 14°; Dew Point, 8°; and Wind, NNE at 4 knots.

3. The Flying Safety Office of the CAA had no information on the unknown sighting.

4. A call was made to the Kansas City Star to find out the source of their brief story of 18 December 55 stating that a meteorite had been seen over the area. The investigators learned that the "Star" had received its story from a Mr. Carroll White at the Control Tower at the Municipal Airport.

5. A contact with the Municipal Airport gave us CAA employee, Mr. White who had seen the object and became another source, but he could not positively identify the object which he had seen.

6. By following a lead mentioned in the TT from 31st AD (Def.) contact was made with Captain [REDACTED] and his description of the sighting.

7. Again by chasing down a lead from the TT from 31st AD (Def.), contact was made via telephone with the city editor of the Lincoln Nebraska Journal of Lincoln, Nebraska (SECRET FJIN 294c). It had been reported that "loud noises or explosions" were heard in conjunction with the sighting. The paper informed the investigators that such noises were reported by an unknown railroad yardman of the Burlington Line working at Humboldt, Nebraska (SECRET FJIN 291b). The paper revealed further that a Dr. C. B. Schultz of the University of Nebraska was working on the subject and was a knowledgeable person in this field.

8. Telephone contact was established with Dr. Schultz, who is the Director of the University of Nebraska Museum at Lincoln. In a stated that from all reports which he received, and from consultations with Professor Collins of that school's Astronomy department, and the noted meteor expert Dr. Lincoln La Paz of New Mexico, that the three of them had decided the object was definitely a meteorite. They further believed that its tail exploded near Humboldt, Nebraska, but the main part struck the north somewhere south of Beatrice, Nebraska (SECRET FJIN 1516). Dr. Schultz and Professor Collins were planning to go looking for the object they were working with was of the same description as the one reported from Kansas City, Missouri and from Red Oak, Iowa. The time of occurrence coincided with the other reports within a few minutes. Dr. Schultz was sure that both he and ourselves were talking of the same object.
