ATIC FORM 329 (REV 26 SEP 52)


- page 1 -

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

11 Mar 59 1549

1/2 4 E 4
3/
4-4x202

S149-7 = 1845

Some text appears to be partially illegible or cut off at the edges of the document. There are also some official-looking stamps and markings on the page, but the text within those is not clearly readable.


- page 2 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality and low contrast. There is a thick black horizontal bar across the top of the document that appears to be redacting or obscuring some text. Only a few fragments of text are partially visible, but they are too blurry to confidently transcribe.
