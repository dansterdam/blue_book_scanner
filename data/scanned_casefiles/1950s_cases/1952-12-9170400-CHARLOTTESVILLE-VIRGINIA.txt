NARRATIVE:

On 15 December 1952 at approximately 205AI in unidentified track appeared on the scope at the Early Warning Ground Radar Site #24, Harunomachi, (with XIFK 5387). The target appeared before 2054I just north of the first plot recorded. It was a rather large blip, clear, and estimated to be more than one target. The initial plot at approximately 205AI was also a clear blip about the size of two targets. The target was seen on the first, second, and fourth sweeps of the antenna between 2054I and 2056I. The antenna speed was 2 rpm, so only four sweeps could exist between two minute plots.

All blips seen were about double target size. The maximum speed was 130 miles per hour.

Between 20561 and 20581 the target was seen only on one sweep. At 20581 the target appeared as four separate and distinct targets, very close together, covering about the same blip area as the preceding blips.

No claims were seen between 20551 and 210AI, but the target seen at 210,I is believed to have been the same object since it appeared about the same size and intensity as all the other plots. The track failed after the 210,I plot. It is believed the reason plots were not obtained on all sweeps was due to the rotation of the new equipment (AN/FPS-16) at this detachment. Possible excessive lobeing and voids may exist in the wave propagation pattern.

COMMENTS OF THE FIELD AGENCY OFFICER:
A check was made of the remainder of the radar sites in this defense area for a possible sighting of track #126, with negative results.

D/I FEAR COMMENT:

1. A check with Air Defense revealed that no friendly aircraft were known to be in the area.

2. The nearest Soviet bases are in the Vladivostok area, approximately 450 nautical miles distant. Penetration of friendly radar by very high-fast flying aircraft is believed possible but improbable.

3. Disposition of friendly radar is reported periodically to Hq USAF. This information should be available from the Director of Statistical Services, Headquarters, United States Air Force.

Yours very truly,

On driving in from the west side, I saw a lot of large scraps of wrapping paper such as is used under insulation by building trade, lying along the road for some two miles, a about three miles NW of the airport. About fifteen minutes after this, a private pilot from a nearby field came in and reported to have seen some big drafts strong enough for him to throttle his cruising speed. He also gained altitude at over five hundred feet a minute. There had been no reported virgin air before this of wash air after. His airborne pilot reported
