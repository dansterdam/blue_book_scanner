           City, Maryland, 1500 hours, 27 Jul 54
           SPECIAL INQUIRY

1. Transmitted herewith for your information is no (1) copy
of Report of Investigation of Special Agent WILLIAM J. DENNIS, JR.
District Office No. 21, dated 3 August 1954, File 53-(24)-11, subject
as above.

2. Subsequent to writing the attached report, the District
Commander, DO 21, was advised by the District Intelligence Officer,
5th Naval District, that investigation by his office revealed a
witness who approached near enough to the object in question to
identify it as a smoke pot. The District Intelligence Officer is
of the opinion that the reported movement of the object can be
accounted for by reason of smoke being blown away from the object
by the wind. The District Intelligence Officer advised that there
was extensive naval activity in the area of subject sighting and that
a helicopter operating in the vicinity observed considerable damage
in the area. The District Intelligence Officer believes that the
smoke pot was used during some naval exercise in which no attempt was
made to recover the pot, and the damage may well be parts of unrecovered experimental models.

3. No further investigative action is contemplated and the
files of the Office of Special Investigations are considered closed.

4. Your attention is invited to the provisions of AFR 124-1,
which prohibit the release of investigative information to unauthorized persons.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation was initiated on 30 July 1954 by the District Commander upon information received from and at the telephonic request of Captain WILLIAM L. HESSLER, District Intelligence Officer (DIO), 5th Naval District, Norfolk, Va. The DIO advised that his office had received information from their Baltimore Office to the effect that at 1500 hours, 27 July 1954, individuals aboard two fishing vessels located southeast of Ocean City, Md., observed an object variously described as a red ball or a ball of red flare, which entered the water approximately 15 miles southeast of Ocean City. The witnesses stated that they observed the object for approximately 15 minutes and variously estimated the speed to be from 8 to 24 knots. One witness observed the object through binoculars. Some of the witnesses stated that the object traveled submerged part of the time, others that it traveled on the surface. The DIO further advised that the water in the area in question is too shallow to permit the operation of a submarine at Snorkel depth and no naval craft of that type were in the vicinity at the time of sighting. The DIO requested OSI to determine whether any Langley AFB activity or the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics could account for subject sighting.

2. Special Agent DWIGHT J. SCOTT participated in this investigation.
AT LANGLEY AFB, VA.

3. On 30 July 1954 DALE SCHEEL, 1st Lt, USAF, AO 2094381, Base Operations, was telephonically contacted and after reviewing his records, advised that Langley AFB had not lost any aircraft on 27 July 1954; that there had been no reported loss of aircraft wing tip tanks on 27 July 1954 and further that Langley AFB aircraft do not conduct firing or bombing practice over the area in question.

4. On 30 July 1954, Mr. [redacted] Acting Engineer-in-Charge, Pilotless Aircraft Research Station, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, Wallops Island, Va., was telephonically contacted by [redacted] and stated in effect that on 27 July 1954 his organization fired a 2-1/2" rocket and a Research Model. The missiles were tracked by radar. The 2-1/2" rocket struck the water approximately 5500 yards from the point of launching. The Research Model struck the water approximately 5000 yards from point of launching. The points of impact of the missiles were approximately 30 miles from Subject sighting. Further advised that during the past three months his organization has not launched any missiles which have a fuel expectancy of more than three (3) seconds and that while critical above launch within an area of two hundred yards from impact points indicated above.
