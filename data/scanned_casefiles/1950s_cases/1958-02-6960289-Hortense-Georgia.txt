5 March 1958

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 5 February 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object you sighted.

A thorough check with radar stations and other operational units in the locality show no unusual reports on 3 February 1950.

The characteristics and maneuvers described in your letter suggest a small glider or large model airplane.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

Dear Sir:

At approximately 9 a.m., Monday Feb 8
I sighted what I first thought was a Cub
place. On second observation I realized it was
too small to be a Cub place & too large to
be a toy. I asked one of the men with me
what he thought it was & he said it must
be a glider as it didn't have a propeller
& we could hear no motor or hear any noise
for power. We were about 7 or 8 hundred feet
from it.

We were traveling west & was about 4 miles
East of Hortense Ga. This place where I saw it
was about 300 ft. high coming in from the
South. To cross the road, as it crossed the
road it was dropping till it was about 25° to
25° over the trees. We watched it the next 100
it might crash, but it leveled off and was
sliding, passed over the trees till mile lost
