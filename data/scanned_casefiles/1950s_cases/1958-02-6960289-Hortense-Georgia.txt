5 March 1958

DEAR MR. 

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 5 February 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object you sighted.

A thorough check with radar stations and other operational units in the locality show no unusual reports on 3 February 1958.

The characteristics and maneuvers described in your letter suggest a small glider or large model airplane.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir:

At approximately 9 p.m. Monday Feb 3 I sighted what I thought was a low glide plane on second observation I realized it was not a plane but some kind of an object which I watched for about 25-30 minutes. The object appeared to be about 35-40 feet in diameter. It seemed to hover and move slowly what appeared to be a whitish glow around it. It did not have a propeller, jet or any visible means of power. We were about 7 miles away from it.

We were travelling west & was about 4 miles east of Hortense, Ga. The object when first sighted was about 2000 ft. coming in from the southeast. It was steadly moving in a northeasterly direction at a great speed. I was watching it through 7x50 binoculars. It was about 35' to 40' over the trees. We watched it till it disappeared.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The text mentions the object being "a light-color grayish or light yellow in color" and traveling at a high speed of 7,000 to 10,000 mph. The location is noted as "Brunswick, Ga."

OCR Output:
As seen - This object was sighted from the ground at Brunswick, Ga. It was a light-color grayish or light yellow in color traveling at a high speed of 7,000 to 10,000 mph, and it was about the size of an ordinary 5 seated car as it went by. To me, it did not seem to make any noise. It just went by at a tremendous rate of speed.
