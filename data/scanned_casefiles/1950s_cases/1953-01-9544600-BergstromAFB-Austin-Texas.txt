IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET SIGHTED BY 2/LT. NAYLOR, FRIDAY, 26 JANUARY 1951, WAS NOT CAUSED BY ONE OF THIS ORGANIZATION'S TRACKED AIRCRAFT. IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS OBSERVED ONLY DURING THE INITIAL CONTACT AND THAT IT APPARENTLY INCREASED IN SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IMMEDIATELY. FROM THE REPORT IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED WHETHER IT WAS AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL OBJECT OR SOME TYPE OF METEORLOGICAL PHENOMENON. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS RECOMMENDED TO DETERMINE IF POSSIBLE CAUSES CAN BE FOUND.

TO ATIC-2
Attn: Mr. James

1. Enclosed for your review and possible evaluation is a sighting of an unidentified object made at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, by an AN/FPN-1 GCA radar set. Only radar contact was made and no further details were observed.

2. ATIC-2 sent the sighting station a copy of ATIC's Electronics Data Sheet which included thereon will afford a basis for a possible conclusion as to the cause of this sighting.

3. While ATIC-2 realizes the importance of comparing atmospheric conditions, i.e. temperature vs altitude, it can't up to the present time provide these data from the Bergstrom GCA station. It is hoped that ATIC-2 may be able to offer a possible solution in the interim.

TO ATIC-5 FROM ATIC-2 DATE 10 MAR 53 COMMENT NO. 2

The page includes an illustration depicting various visual emergency signals that can be used, such as hand signals, flares, and other methods to attract attention.

SEARCH AND RESCUE

Search and Rescue Service is a life saving service provided through the combined efforts of the C.A.A., Air Force, and Coast Guard who are assisted by other organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Sheriff Police, and many other agencies as may be available. It provides search, survival and rescue of personnel of missing or crashed aircraft.

All you need to remember or application in this include procedure is:

1. File a Flight Plan with a C.A.A Communications Station in person or by telephone or radio.  
2. File an Arrival Report.
3. If anyone fails to arrive at destination or other than scheduled information, report this missing to the nearest C.A.A Communications Station.
4. If you land enroute and are delayed more than an hour, report this information to the nearest communications station.
5. Remember that if you fail to report within one hour after your E.T.A., a search will be started to locate you. If found to require assistance of the Search and Rescue Service, this will be indicated.

Searches are expensive. They involve numerous aircraft and man hours, on numerous occasions the lives of other pilots are sacrificed when searching for lost or overdue pilots. SO, FILE AN ARRIVAL REPORT.

GROUND TO AIR EMERGENCY CODE DISTRESS SIGNALS

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Lay out symbols by using strips of fabric or parachutes, pieces of wood, stones, or any available material. 
2. Symbols should be at least 10 feet high or larger, if possible. Care should be taken to lay out symbols exactly as shown.
3. Symbols should be as far apart as possible from other symbols.
4. In addition to using symbols, every effort is to be made to attract attention by means of radio, flares, smoke, or other available means.
5. When ground is covered with snow, signals can be made by stamping, shoveling, or trampling the snow. The distressed area forming the symbols will appear in the black, from the air.
6. Pilot should acknowledge any sighting of the signals by rocking wings from side to side.

While on duty at the GCA station, Bergstrom AFB, Austin, Texas, 2/Lt Gerald V. Kelley observed an unidentified flying object in the vicinity. This object was observed from 15:35 to 15:37 hours. It was approximately 3/4 inches in width and 3/4 inches in length with a hazy glow. This object was stationary to as fast or faster than jet aircraft. After it disappeared it reappeared in the same vicinity. Further observation was made, but the object was not observed to be in the vicinity, and no other observations of this object were made.

The observer has not made a report of this incident to any other agency.

The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document states the following:

While performing the duties of an Aircraft Landing Control Technician, in the operations of ground control approach (GCA) on the 23rd of January 1953 at Bergstrom Air Force Base, Austin, Texas, the following circumstances:

The pilot, while flying at approximately 15,000 ft while utilizing the thirty mile range of the ILS Position Indicator in an attempt to locate a flight of thirty-three airplanes returning to Bergstrom AFB and performing a controlled approach on arrival, 1st/Lt Kelley observed a rear return or unusual reading on the ground control radar scope. Upon moving in a southerly direction to an approach bearing of 275 degrees, an extremely rapid rate of speed as indicated by the return was noted. The return was diametrically opposite to and intermittently visible during the time frame of 22:55 to 23:10 hours, at which time the return stopped abruptly, hesitated briefly, then resumed its normal flight path, and again remained stationary. His attention was then diverted by the normal flow of air traffic control. In the interval he had noted the Bergstrom control tower and requisitioned that they scan the scope, at which time the return was still present. A second and third return were then formed, proceeding at an indicated airspeed of 15EOKT to 1500KT, at an altitude of approximately 13,000 ft, and returned to the thirty mile range for 285 degrees and 237 degrees, at 18 and 19 miles respectively for a short interval of time. The returns had subsequently vanished prior to the fifteen mile range of the Bergstrom control tower, and indicated that they were out of the range of the Bergstrom APN-4 at a bearing of 310 degrees which remained stationary for the entire interval of observation. After discharging traffic control duties, 1st/Lt Kelley returned to the thirty mile station from Bergstrom which revealed nothing unusual. On the morning of the 24th, Jan 1953, the same phenomena as described was again witnessed at approximately 1550OCT. He kept constant surveillance from this until relieved at 1800OCT without further contact.

The return was similar to that which is produced by a large formation of aircraft leaving and returning, being in the center and 1 c-147 aircraft in the formation differed or varied at all returns in question appeared to be of similar dimensions. When in motion, the speed was extremely high, in excess of what would be considered possible for conventional aircraft of that period. All the returns in question appeared to be of similar dimensions.
