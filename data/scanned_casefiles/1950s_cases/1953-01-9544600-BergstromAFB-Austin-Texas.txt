SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Targets

TO: Base Intelligence
Bergstrom Air Base
Austin, Texas

It is my opinion that the unidentified targets sighted by Technician Sergeant Kelley, Friday, 24 January 1953 was not due to malfunction of the radar set. Anyway, he was able to make it clear that I was not present at the time of the sighting and did not observe the targets first-hand. My opinion is based purely on the testimony of a technician. Briefly, the particular radar set involved. No evidence of malfunction has been found or noted since the incident.

SUBJECT: (UNCLASSIFIED) Radar Sighting of Unknown Aerial Object

TO: Commanding Officer
Bergstrom Air Force Base
Austin, Texas

1. A GCA station at your base made electronic contact with un-
identified aerial phenomena on or about 27 Jan 53, 150632, while
monitoring local air traffic. In an attempt to uncover a logical
explanation for such sightings, the Air Technical Intelligence Cen-
ter has developed a questionnaire for sightings made by ground radar,
one of which is an enclosed to this letter.

2. ATIC radar specialists have found the subject questionnaires
of great value in attempting to explain radar contacts with unknown
flying objects when they are filled out completely and accurately by
the radar personnel involved.

3. ATIC would, therefore, appreciate the completion and forward-
ing of the Electronics Data Sheet at your earliest possible convenience.

1. Enclosed for your review and possible evaluation is a sighting of an unidentified object made at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, by an AN/MPM-1 GCA radar set. Only radar contact was made without any simultaneous visual observations.

2. ATIA-5 sent the sighting station a copy of ATIC's Electronics Data Sheet which was worked out jointly by ATIC and ATIA-5. It is hoped that information included thereon will afford a basis for a possible conclusion as to the cause of sighting.

3. While ATIA-5 realizes the importance of comparing atmospheric conditions, i.e., temperature vs altitude, dewpoint vs altitude with the anonymous radar pickups, it takes up to a month to receive these data from the Asheville Weather Central. If possible, it is hoped that ATIA-2 may be able to offer a possible solution in the interim.

SEARCH AND RESCUE

Search and Rescue Service is a life saving service provided through the combined efforts of the CAA, Air Force, and Coast Guard who are assisted by other organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Sheriffs Air Patrol, State Police, and such other agencies as may be available. It provides search, survival aid, and rescue of personnel of missing or crashed aircraft.

All you need to remember to obtain this valuable protection is:
1. File a Flight Plan with a CAA Airway Communications Station in person or by telephone or radio.
2. File an Arrival Report.
3. If you land at a location other than intended destination, report the landing to the nearest communications Station.
4. If you land enroute and are delayed more than an hour, report this information to the nearest communications station.
5. Remember that if you fail to report within one hour after your E.T.A., a search will be started to locate you. If you fail to report within three hours after your E.T.A. the full facilities of the Search and Rescue Service will be activated.

Searches are expensive, they inconvenience other people, and on numerous occasions the lives of other pilots are sacrificed when searching for lost or overdue pilots. SO, FILE AN ARRIVAL REPORT!

While on duty at the GCA station, Bergstrom AFB, Austin, Texas, T/Sgt Gerald V. Kelley reported an unidentified radar return on an AN/MPN-1 GCA set. Sgt Kelley was operating on booth the 20 and 15 mile range setting. The size of the blip was 3/16 inches and 3/4 inches in length with fuzzy edges. This object was observed between 1540 and 1559 hours CST. The speed of the object varied from stationary to as fast or faster than jet aircraft. After 16 disappeared in the area where it appeared was kept under surveillance for a period of about 5 minutes. No further returns were observed. No aircraft were in the vicinity, and no other observations of an object were reported.

The observer has not made a report of this incident to any other agency.

Constant surveillance was not maintained until approximately 1550CT since information had not realized the importance of this information and had not been taken.

12th Strategic Fighter Wing                                2     3

While performing the duties of an Aircraft Landing Control Technician in specific the operation of the Plan Position Indicator portion of ground radar set AN/TPS-1 on the 22nd of January 1953 at Bergstrom Air Force Base, Austin, Texas, T/Sgt Gerald W. Kelley observed radar returns of an unusual nature under the following circumstances.

The first sighting was made at approximately 1500CST while utilizing the thirty mile range of the Plan Position Indicator in an attempt to locate a flight of four aircraft letting down to Bergstrom AFB and requesting the service of Ground Control Approach on arrival. T/Sgt Kelley observed a radar return of unusual proportions moving at a rapid rate of speed from an approximate bearing of 295 degrees in a southerly direction to an approximate bearing of 275 degrees at which time a ceased motion 21 miles from Bergstrom AFB was undetermined in length of time. It then moved in a westerly direction for approximately 2 statute miles and again remained stationary. His attention was then diverted by the normal flow of air traffic necessitating return to the 15 mile range for greater accuracy in control. In the interval he had contacted the Bergstrom control tower to course of returns and request information on large formation flights in the area, receiving an acknowledgment and a receive report. On completion of pertinent traffic control at approximately 1450CST he returned to the thirty mile range and observed two separate returns in stationary position, 285 degrees and 207 degrees, at 18 and 19 miles respectively for a short interval of time until necessary to return to the fifteen mile range. At this time he contacted Bergstrom control tower and requested that they scan the area with binoculars; a negative report of scan was received. At approximately 1500CST he again returned to the thirty mile range and observed a single stationary return 22 miles from Bergstrom AFB at bearing 310 degrees which remained stationary for the entire interval of observation until return to the fifteen mile range was once more necessary. After discharging traffic duties T/Sgt Kelley returned to the thirty mile range and observed a stationary return bearing 275 degrees approximately 17 miles from Bergstrom which remained stationary for a short time, then began a rapid movement on a course of 0 degrees to a bearing of 322 where it again ceased motion and remained stationary for approximately 30 seconds. It then faded and disappeared at approximately 1555CST. He took concurrent surveillance from this time until approximately 1450CST with no further contact.

The return was similar to that which is produced by a large formation of aircraft, being of elliptical shape, approximately 3/4" in length and approximately 3/16" in width, being bright in the center and slightly diffused or spread at the edges. The fast line constant during the observation was approximately 1.5 miles. All observations, all returns in question appeared to be of similar dimensions. When in motion the return appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed as the sweep trace was reduced. A defining accuracy in position of each return which was experienced would indicate ground speeds in excess of 350 mph. He was unable to determine the approximate speed, except that the return traversed a distance of approximately 15 miles in a radar scope of seconds.

Constant surveillance was not maintained until approximately 1550CST since T/Sgt Kelley had not realized the importance of what he was observing and had not been made aware of pertinent regulations. All times are approximate as they were taken at the beginning and end of observations to the nearest five minutes until 1550CST after which the accuracy is to the minute. All bearings were approximate to the nearest 5 degrees.
