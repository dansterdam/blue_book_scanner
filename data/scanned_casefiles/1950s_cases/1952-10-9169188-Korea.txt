AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Det 1, 6004th ATIS, APO 970
On 16 and 17 October 1952, 1st Lt William H. Cooper and 1st Lt Tho mas A. Lemon, Jr., of the 6004th ATIS, were interviewed with regard to the sighting of an unidentified object. 
On 16 October 1952 at 11:45 PM, a USAF C-47 aircraft carrying certain air material personnel was at an altitude of 9,500 ft, over terrain approximately 50 miles west of Taegu, Korea, when the pilot observed a bright light of considerable size approaching the aircraft from the rear. The light kept closing on the aircraft, and the pilot took evasive action by diving the aircraft to an indicated altitude of 8,000 ft. At this point, the light was closing in on the aircraft, and the pilot fired two bursts from his machine guns at the object. The object appeared to be reflecting the tracer bullets, and the pilot observed that it was about the size of a basketball at arm's length. The object then appeared to move off to the side of the aircraft and the pilot was able to regain the altitude he had lost. The pilot estimated the speed of the object to be approximately 600 mph.
The nearest observation was made at a distance of 3 to 4 miles.

HILLS at the hoverir position, and as it traveled away, and seemed constant
as to size and color.

The pilot stated that at no time during their observation did the object
increase or decrease in altitude.

The weather, conditions at the time was 4/10 covered at 4,000 feet with base
at 4,500 feet variable. Visibility was 5 miles turbulence did ground 2-3 miles,
winds 270 velocity - 15 kts.  
Direction was unknown. 

The sun was to the rear of the F-94 as the plane was headed west. 
The observation was made from the F-94 fighter aircraft at an altitude of 
approximately 4,000 feet. The object was observed for about 2-3 minutes before it disappeared from sight.

1. Both pilots are in their initials and seemed to have level headed and reliable.

2. This report coincides and describes the position and characteristics of the first 
sighting, and no erratic or violent maneuvers were observed as described by other 
reports. The fact that they got a confirmed fix on the object is of value, although 
it is considered that their estimate of distance and dimension appear to be prone to 
variations.

3. This report is made to intelligence as per AR 95-62, dated 24 June 1949. Det 
1, 604th Air Intelligence Service, APO 970, reviewed the information contained in 
this report and has discussed this incident with the observer. 

The balloon, anchored at 50 feet, had observed by the same observer on 7 June 1952, 
this balloon, anchored was called by him to attention specifically for comparison of 
the object observed. On 7 June 1952 at approximately 1030 hours, a weather balloon 
was observed of known characteristics as to size, shape, and movement, having been
observed by the same crew in the same F-94 aircraft.  The balloon has been observed
at altitude of 48,000 feet. 

4. The reported position of this captive balloon is approximately 6 miles NNW of the F-94 fighter aircraft position. This captive balloon had been observed a time on
7 June 1952, and the crew definitely stated that the object observed on 9 June 1952 
was not the same balloon, the size and movement were different.

The wind at the time was from 270 degrees at 15 knots. This movement and the fact that 
no visible payout of line such as would be attached to a balloon could have caused this
reaction. The object made a sharp turn without a perceptible change of wind direction or
an air pocket could have caused this reaction.

It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was the official U.S. Air Force program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is an "Air Intelligence Information Report" dated October 3, 1952, regarding a sighting of a small airborne object in reference to an incident that occurred on September 12, 1952.

INTELLIGENCE REPORT 
Incident: Report No. 52-376

1. A military airborne observation of a small airborne object in reference to an incident reported on 12 September 1952. Since the reference points would normally be some distance from the object, and as the vertical angles were apparently quite small, it is very near to the object. Since the reference points would normally be some distance from the object, it is concluded that the object must have been hovering, and to some extent moving in a direction opposite to the relative motion of the observing vehicle.

2. Since enemy balloons are known to have been used in this vicinity, this incident could possibly have been observation of such a balloon. No action was taken.

STATEMENT
On 15 October 1952 at approximately 11:00-12:05, the object that conditions were four contrails parallel that were observed over the flying through the air area near Sunchon, North Korea. The route of the object was to take us over the Ranch Head area, continuing on to the northwest, the object to move the observed at high speed. The object was also observed military aircraft flying along the MIR on an Easterly heading. The object remained in view for a period of approximately 1 minute, during which time rapid and erratic changes of direction were observed, indicating speed of approximately 900 mph. The observation of the object was first observed in Grid Square DT.
The I called the attention of the object to let Lt. Hooper for his observation. Hooper made identical observation. The object appeared to be a cylindrical in shape and size appeared to be approximately 50 feet in diameter. The color of the object was aluminum in color. First sighting, the approximate the speed to be 700 mph. As the object drew nearer, the speed stepped up to an estimated 900 mph. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute after which time disappeared from view. The object was 25 feet in diameter and silver in color. No smoke or exhaust was observed. We turned the aircraft to keep the object under observation, but the object continued on and disappeared from view while the other pilot was wearing Air Force issued sun glasses. Object hovered in Grid Square DT 2224.

Text from the document:

STATEMENT
17 October 1952 

On 16 October 1952 while in the vicinity of the French Bowl, DT 9942 at 0652T, three (3) miles northeast of Suwon, Korea, an object was observed. This object appeared to be at an extremely high altitude, traveling on an easterly heading at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to be circular in shape, a bright silver in color, and was observed to stop and hover. After a brief stop, the object continued on in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. The speed of the object is estimated at 800 MPH as it covered approximately 19,000 feet. The objects speed was estimated at 800 MPH as it covered approximately 19,000 feet. 

At the time of the observation, it was a clear day and all-this-time the military Air Force issued sun glasses and pilot goggles were being worn, and when I first observed the object it was outlined against a background of blue sky and what appeared to be white fluffy clouds. The object was brighter than the sky background as it was a brilliant silver in color. I observed the object until it was in the vicinity of the coastline at which time it faded from sight due to early morning mist over the ocean.

From my heading, the object was observed at the following clock positions: 1.) from right due to early morning mist over the ocean.
