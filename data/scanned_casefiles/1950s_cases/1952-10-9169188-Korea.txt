AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det 1, 6504th .139, AFO 970                52-276                PAGE 2 OF 4 PAGES

On 16 and 17 October 1952, 1st Lt William H. Cooper and 1st Lt Thomas A. 
O'Neill of the 6149th Tac Con Sq, 314th Tactical Control Group at K-14, were 
interviewed with regard to the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

On the morning of 16 October 1952, Lt Cooper, instructor pilot and Lt O'Neill, 
pilot, were flying a combat mission in a T-6 aircraft over the eastern sector of 
the main line of resistance. "t 0650M, Lt Hooper was flying the aircraft on a 
magnetic heading of 230 de grees, 140 miles per hour indicated air speed, 6,300 
feet altitude. Lt O'Neill was checking the MLR for activity when he first 
observed that he thought was a strange aircraft at 6,000 feet altitude, traveling 
approximately 200 mph and heading in an easterly direction. Then he first 
observed the object it was at approximately UT coordinates DT221413 on the T-6 
was at E231236. The object was 15 degrees to the right of his course traveling 
on a magnetic heading of 100 degrees.

Lt O'Neill called the object to the attention of Lt Hooper who did not 
observe it until the aircraft and the object came parallel. He then saw it at 
the 3 o'clock position. Lt O'Neill stated that as he was "callin' off the relative 
positions of the object for Lt Hooper (who was attempting to pick it up) the 
object accelerated to be declerate. By the time Lt Hooper observed it, the 
object had apparently ceased to move and was hovering over MT2942. Both observers 
report the fact that the object ceased movement, but did not see to the length of 
time how long it hovered. Lt Hooper estimates the time at 1 1/2 to 2 seconds. 
Reports the time to be approximately 1 to 2 seconds.

Lt Hooper dipped the right wing of the aircraft for a better observation of 
the object. It began to move, accelerating in an east-north easterly direction 
and disappeared from sight in the haze at the T-6 on approximately 120 degrees, 
the speed of the object at this time was estimated by both observers to be 
approximately 600 mph. Lt Hooper bases his statement on upon the time elapsed in 
it's covering approximately 15,000 meters.

Lt O'Neill stated that at first he thought the object was a jet or liaison 
type aircraft, but upon further observation, it did not appear to have any aero 
dynamic features. Both observers concurred in the statement that the object was 
perfectly circular in shape and metallic silver in color with no protrusions of 
any type. Both observers stated that the object did not appear to have any 
visible means of propulsion and no vapor trails or smoke were apparent. The 
estimated size was 25 feet in diameter, by comparison with the 37 foot wing span 
of a T-6 aircraft at the same distance. No sound from the object was audible at 
any time.

The object was under observation for approximately three minutes from 0450, 
to 0533 with Lt O'Neill observing it for the full period of time. Lt O'Neill 
who made his observations with the naked eye, described the object as "looking 
slightly while Lt Hooper, who wore "government issued sunglasses", did not observe 
anything other than that."

The nearest observation was made at a distance of 3 to 4 miles.

The object was seen against three back ground, clouds at the first sighting.

hills at the hoverin position, and sky as it traveled away, and seemed constant
as to size, shape and color to both observers.

The pilots stated that at no time during their observation did the object
increase or decrease in altitude.

The weather conditions at the time was 4/10 covered at 6,000 feet with bases
at 4,500 feet. Visibility, air to air was 10 miles, air to ground 5 miles, wind
was 270 at 15 knots and direction was unknown. The sun was to the rear of the F-51
observation was made until the aircraft made a right turn near the end of the
observation, when the object was more away from the observers in an east north
easterly direction, distant from sight.

CONTENTS OF REPORT - OFFICIAL

1. Both pilots are in their thirties and seemed level headed and reliable.
They reported to the incident and reacted to the interview with no apparent nervous-
ness or excitement. They were quite certain in their description and gave a
good deal of detail. (their reporting of the incident was very factual). It
is considered that 27 miles and 14 O'Neill had concluded 25 miles and it
is considered that their judgment in estimating distance and dimensions seems
excellent. All their estimates of dimensions, speed and distance were given
comparison to some known factors, for example the speed of their own aircraft as
compared to jets and F-51's that they have worked with. They had no preconceived opinion as to what the observation might have been, although they immediately discounted the possibility of its being a weather balloon because of its
solid metallic appearance and perfectly circular shape.

2. Reference is made to Int-elligence Report 52-121, dated 24 June 1952, Det
4th, 600th Air Intelligence -Service Squadron. This report contains information
concerning the sighting of a large enemy captive balloon located in the grid
square 2X181 in the area of hill 1290. This balloon, anchored by cable, has
been sighted several times, during daylight and in darkness by means of a
light sometimes suspended from it. It has been spotted as far away from its tie
down point at 9:20A, 1952 by ground observers. On 7 June 1952, at approximately
2120T, a light was observed by a representative of this unit for a period of one
hour and five minutes in the FT181A area. Tentatively ground observation post
observed a large balloon being raised and lowered by means of a cable at this
point on 7 June 1952 at 1645T. The balloon has been observed to move horizontally
very rapidly, in some cases it has been described as being egg shaped, in others
the shape is "scribed" as round. The balloon has been observed at altitudes of
from 1,000 to 10,000 feet.

3. The location of the reported position of this captive balloon is approximately 1,700 meters, on a bearing of 223 degrees from the position of the
sighting as reported by the source. "This places the observer, the object and
the two sources of light on a line of sight." The wind at 6,000 feet was
from 260 degrees at 20-25 knots per hour. It is possible that the object sighted
by these pilots was a "captive balloon" rising, blowing in
a south easterly direction, "his movement of controlled descent, being blown
by the prevailing wind could be mistaken for an object traveling in an south
easterly direction. The object appeared to stop and hover over TY229/1622. A
change of wind direction or an air pocket could have caused this reaction.

D/F YEAR Comments:

1. Airborne orientation of a small airborne object in reference to a maneuvering aircraft is extremely difficult, particularly when the aircraft is very near to the object. Since the reference points would normally be points on the ground near the line-of-sight to the object, a nearby object would appear to be moving in a direction opposite to the relative motion of the observing aircraft.

2. Since enemy balloons are known to have been used in this vicinity, this observation was probably of some location reported in MR-52-124, Det 1, 6004th AISS, dated 24 June 1952.

On 16 October 1952 at approximately 0650, the weather conditions were four tenths (4/10) at sixty-five hundred (6500) and ten (10) miles visibility. We had just finished checking in with Zimmerman Control and were told to go to Early Bird Control. The route of travel was to take up over the Punch Bowl. After completing a turn in Grid Square DT 236, I being in the back seat, started to check the MIR aircraft flying along the MIR on an Easterly heading. I remarked to 1st Lt. Hooper that there was a strange aircraft traversing along the MIR at six-thousand (6000) feet indicated. At this time we were approximately sixty-three hundred (6300) feet indicated. The observation of the object was first observed in Grid Square, DT 2241, against a cloud background.

I called the attention of the object to 1st Lt. Hooper for his observation.

I first time I noticed the object, it was 1230 from us. This time we both had the object under observation. At first altitude, I approximated the speed to be 200 MIL. When object was approximately 2 o'clock from us, it started to slow down. At that time there was no background but the darkness of the hills. The object hovered and we dipped the right wing to observe. The object was 25 feet in diameter and silver in color, atmosphere's clear. The object was hovering at the object other than the compass path of flight to the East by Northeast heading, accelerating to a speed of approximately 800 MIL. We turned the aircraft to keep the object under observation. The object then was approximately 3 miles from us. I was observing it with the naked eye, while the other pilot was wearing Air Force issued sun glasses. Object hovered in Grid Square, DT 2942.

On 16 October 1952 while in the vicinity of the Punch Bowl, DT 2842 at 0652L, while on a heading of 280 degrees, I observed an unidentified object approximately three (3) miles North Northwest of my position, traveling on an Easterly heading and moving down. Spherical shaped, approximately 15 feet in diameter. When first observed, I dropped the right wing to get a better view of the object. At this time the object was observed to stop and hover. Object started moving in an East North Easterly direction, accelerating to what I estimated to be about 800 miles per hour. As the object started moving, I turned toward it. Object's speed was estimated at 800 MPH as it covered approximately 15,000 meters in such short lapse of time.

At the time of the observation, I was wearing Air Force issued sun glasses and pilot in the rear cockpit was drawing 11 with "naked eyes". Object appeared to have the same color and shape as a ball bearing. The sun was at my back and when I first observed the object at maximum engine power at a background of hills. My altitude was 6300 feet indicated and the object was at approximately 6,000 feet indicated. I first observed the object in the vicinity of DT 285426, I observed the object until it was in the vicinity of the coastline at which time it faded from sight due to early morning haze over the ocean.

From my heading, the object was observed at the following clock positions:
1, 2 and 3 o'clock. At 3 o'clock, the object was outlined against a background of hills...I observed the object for about 15 seconds at the hovering position.
