AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

D/I FEAF                                   IR-20-52                                   PAGE    1    OF    2

The following is submitted in compliance with paragraph 74, AFL 200-5 dated 29 April 1952:

1. Description of Object: The size of the object ('bite') as it appeared on the Plan 12 Indicator was approximately 3 to 5 miles in length and 1 to 1 mile in width. The Plan 12 Indicator was set for a-60 miles area with no delay. Estimated speed of the object was 2700 miles per hour. The brightness of the object was normal.

2. Time of Sighting: The object first appeared at 1207-I and faded from the scope at 1209-I.

3. Manner of Observation: The sighting was made on T-33-13 type radar with MTD band.

4. Electronic Data: The object was observed on the Plan 12 Indicator. The transmitted signal was 1273.5 megacycles. The pulse repetition rate was approximately 203 pulses per second. The pulse width was 4 microseconds. The range was set for a sixty miles sweep with no delay. The amount of gas and ground returns were normal. Since the object appeared for only two minutes on the scope, maintenance was not able to adequately check the set for malfunction, however the size, shape and location of the echo were such that set trouble seemed to be very remote. Set was operating normally before and after the incident.

4. Location of Observer: The geographic coordinates of Detachment 21, 618th AC&W Squadron are 1525'13"/39'19". Heading of the object was 0052 until it reached 1205'13"/38'09". The position of the object was at approximately 310° and held this heading until it reached 120°23'13"/37'8-09'14. At this point the object assumed a heading of 230° until it reached 120°23'13"/37'8-09'14. No information can adequately be given in regard to the altitude of the object, since the radar set has never been calibrated. It is believed that average in this particular area is only at high altitude, possibly due to mountains terrain a short distance from the antenna, when pointing in the direction the object was observed.

5. Reliability of the Observer: The radar operator who made this observation is considered reliable and has had six months experience in his present position.

6. Further Remarks on Estimated Reliability of the Citation: The area in which the object appeared is not a heavy traffic area, however, jet aircraft have been plotted in this area in the past. A few conclusions of the aircraft sighted have travelled at a speed which would be considered irregular.

6. Weather Conditions: Weather in general was fair and sea condition was calm. Visibility was approximately 5 miles, with haze.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

6. After sundown 28x December 1951, objects sighted. No year battle, however, was fought. Sightings were made by ground observers and radar operators at Kimpo, but observations were not substantiated and were not correlated.

7. At Pusan(?) AFB, Taejon, on 28 Nov 1951, observer checked sightings. Sightings were made by ground observers and radar operators. Observers reported seeing objects which appeared to be round, silver colored, and moving at high speed. Radar operators reported tracking objects which appeared to move at high speed. Approximately 20 seconds. Reporting agency states that they were not damaged.

8. There are no cars in the UFO offices from 9 Dec & 12 Dec in Taejon.

9. At Taegu AFB, located on 28 December 1951, sightings of a MACO and other unidentified objects were made. Observers could not determine origin of objects.

10. There are no cars in the UFO offices near Pusan during December 1951.

11. There were three cases for cars on 28 December 1951:
    a. At Chinhae at 1730-2000 hours a white disc was seen in close or close.
    b. At Masan a pilot reported a UFO which was observed to have been over the city which was not substantiated.
    c. At 1830-2030 hours was not a valid sighting of an unidentified flying object which could be verified.

12. There are no cars in the UFO offices on 19 April 1952.

13. On 25 February 1952 at Taegu, cars of 18 observers of ground & sky were checked. They were about 200 yds. in good visibility. Observers stated that each observer saw a different object. No correlation could be made.

14. UFO reported seen at Taegu on 28 Dec was a car.
