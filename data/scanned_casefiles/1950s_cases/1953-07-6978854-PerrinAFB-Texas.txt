AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: 9 July 1953 report/Perrin AFB, Texas
On the night of 9 July 1953, at 2139 hours, the control tower at Perrin Air Force Base, Texas, received a phone call from the pilot of a T-33 jet aircraft who reported sighting an unidentified flying object. The object was described as being round and white in color, and was observed to be going straight up. The pilot stated that he had made two passes at the object but was unable to get closer than a mile. The light was said to be going straight up.

Transcribed text from the document:

Dear Capt. Harding:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just now gotten around to looking over The large batch of accumulated reports. I must say that compared with Black Hawk, none of these approach the interest. These incidents do not appear as promising as they did when first reported. The Perrin AFB, Texas, case to me is still rather puzzling and may prove to be profitable.

The very interesting reports of the 24 July and 1 August at Key West would warrant follow-up if they were more recent.

The 25 July Perrin AFB, Texas, also holds possible interest from the standpoint of personnel and the fast they were observed from the Control Tower and by civilians of Denison, Texas.

It is too bad there is not more information on Coco, Ala. These cases cover several months and the data is possibly too dif in these.

Finally, the Sidi Slimane sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably have to remain so unresolved.

As for the remaining 30 or 40, there is so little information concerning those which do not have obvious explanations that there is no percentage whatever in considering them seriously.

Chiefly, the lack of detailed information as to speed, size, shape, duration, altitude, and time was available, would be interesting to pursue. Personally, I feel that the incidents involving the Black Hawk case have been better observed and studied than this will be, and if staff and time were available, would be interesting to pursue. Personally, I feel certain that if this case can be explained, others would follow suit.

Concerning the Black Hawk case, I believe we are now proceeding along the most fruitful lines of investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the observations covered several hours and the lighted wings were both visible and radar. It is important, in my estimation, that we continue to pursue this case as diligently as possible, even though the results may be incapable of final resolution.

Statement by 1/Lt Thomas M. Davis Jr.

Data Operation advised me of the sighting of the lights last night at the field. 
The lights were seen moving in erratic and oscillating manner, appearing and disappearing at various intervals. They were of a bluish-white color and seemed to be at a high altitude, possibly several thousand feet. They were sighted for approximately 25 to 30 minutes. The lights appeared to be coming from the southeast, moving in a northwesterly direction and then reversing their course, repeating this maneuver several times.

The total number of lights observed was difficult to determine, as they appeared to wink out at times and then reappear at other times. The individual lights also varied in size, some appearing quite large and others smaller. The speed of the lights was estimated to be in excess of 1,000 mph. No sound was associated with the lights.

The lights were observed by several pilots and crew members who were on the line at the time. I directed that the information be forwarded to higher headquarters, through channels, for any further action deemed necessary.

The image contains a handwritten description of an aircraft sighting, but does not include any photographs. The text in the document says:

THE LEFT WING TIP LIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT WOULD DESCRIBE IT SOME COLOR AND INTENSITY, BUT NO RIGHT WING LIGHT WAS SHOWING ON ANY OF THE SEVEN OBJECTS THROUGH THEY WERE HEADED TOWARD ME.

- page 7 -

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch that appears to depict multiple objects in the sky, described as "UP AND TOWARD TOWER (MY POSITION)". The description states that there were seven objects, and the sketch shows a series of dots arranged in an upward direction, with an arrow pointing towards the top.

Text from the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound NONE
b. Color RED

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you see such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The shape of the object were:
(Circle One) a. Blurry b. Fuzzy c. Sharply outlined d. Indistinguishable

19. IF there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? SEVEN
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

- page 8 -

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved skyline with a bright object above it, and the instructions ask the reader to imagine that they are at the point shown and to indicate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when they first saw it, and then to show how high it was when they last saw it.

The second sketch contains two larger drawings. The left one shows a landscape with a person standing in the foreground, and the instructions ask the reader to place an "A" at the position where the object was when they first saw it, and a "B" at its position when they last saw it. The right sketch is a smaller example showing how to complete the larger sketch.

Transcribing the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

"To answer your question and explain just what I saw and thought about, the I saw a strange object flying near Perrin AFB that looked like a formation of several apparently uncooordinated objects moving at high speed at about 10,000 feet and at a direction of 180 degrees. This happened for about 2 or 3 minutes before the objects disappeared. I could not estimate their size or exact nature, but they did not resemble any aircraft I am familiar with. Please let me know if you need any further information."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
(1) Seven (7) objects were sighted by all the persons present in a clear night sky. Objects were estimated to be approximately 1000 to 5000 feet from the observers and descended from an altitude of about 10,000 feet at a high rate of speed. The objects appeared to be circular in shape and glowed in a yellowish white color. All the objects appeared to fade out and drift toward the west.
(2) The objects were estimated to be approximately 25 to 50 feet in diameter, from the comparison of their apparent size to known aircraft or ground objects of a standard size, as observed at 5,757 standard time, 25 July 1953.
(3) Observation was visual from the ground.
(4) Observers were 1st Lt R...R-.... AD, 36Oth Bomb Sq, 310th Bomb Wing, Perrin AFB, Texas; 1st Lt L... K..., AD, 3602d AISS, Perrin AFB, Texas; and 1st Lt J... W... H..., AD, 3602d AISS, Perrin AFB, Texas. The objects were sighted at about 2300 hours on 25 July 1953, approximately 5 miles southwest of Perrin AFB, Texas, at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet.
(5) The reaction of the persons sighting the objects was one of surprise and awe, since the objects seemed to disappear and reappear at will and were traveling at a very high rate of speed.
(6) As a result of this sighting, an attempted radar track was made to identify the objects but the objects disappeared before a positive radar track could be established. A plane from the Kerrville Control Airport was vectored to the area but made no visual contact with the objects.
(7) This report is considered to be factual in content.
(8) There is no evidence of any hostile intent on the part of the object or objects.
(9) The Air Force standard identification procedures were followed.

This is a project in my behalf and viewed them twice. (2) was a fairly light or illuminous object, appear as a (3) bright like a star, blue-white in color, about (4) 2-3 miuntes. 
(5) unknown. (6) estimated size of a large aircraft, varying somewhat in intensity at times. The shape appeared to be circular or elliptical at time and length. (7) Visible in (8) 30 to 40 eeconds and disappeared to the north or northeast,, the object did not leave any smoke, trail, exhaust or other visible evidence of propulsion. It moved at a very rapid speed, estimated to be several hundred miles per hour. The officer (9) spotlighted, tried to get a telescopic look at it, but was unable to do so. 
(10) unknown. The air police said they observed the same type of object on several occasions. (11) unknown.
The object appeared to be under intelligent control as the changes in size, speed, and direction indicated. They were unable to determine the distance, altitude or rate of speed other than it was obviously very fast. The object did not show any conventional wings, tail surfaces or other identifiable features of an aircraft. They believe the object was powered by some unconventional type of propulsion system. They were unable to specify whether the light was reflection of some kind or an actual light source. They are definite however, that the object they observed was not a star, planet, meteor, aircraft or any conventional type of flying object known to them.

STATEMENT BY 
OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED JULY 25, 1953 - JULY 25, 1953 - THREE OBJECTIVES AND BRIGHT LIGHT IN CENTER, OBSERVED FROM PERRIN AFB, TEXAS AT APPROXIMATELY 2020 TO 2030 HOURS. OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED TO MOVE IN CIRCULAR MOTION FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AND THEN MOVED AWAY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND DISAPPEARED.

THESE OBJECTS GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF FLYING IN A MANNER OF UNCONVENTIONAL FLIGHT PATTERN. THEIR MOVEMENTS SEEMED LOGICAL AND CONTROLLED. THE FIRST TWO OBJECTS CHANGED POSITION RAPIDLY WHILE THE THIRD OR CENTER OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY. AS THE TWO OBJECTS MOVED OUTWARD THE CENTER OBJECT APPEARED TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY IN SIZE, THEN DIMINISHED UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED. THESE OBJECTS SEEMED TO MOVE SLOWLY AT FIRST, THEN INCREASED SPEED AND LEFT THE AREA RAPIDLY.

AT THIS TIME GREEN OR AMBER COLORED LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED LARGER THAN THE SIZE OF THE OBJECTS. THESE LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 3-5 SECONDS THEN DISAPPEARED. IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE AN ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF SPEED OR SIZE SINCE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE OBSERVED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE.

A AIRCRAFT APPEARED IN THE SKY AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME AS THE OBJECTS. THIS AIRCRAFT WAS HEADING IN THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION AS THE OBJECTS AND SEEMED TO BE IN PURSUIT OF THEM. THE AIRCRAFT COULD BE EASILY IDENTIFIED AS A T-33 TRAINER.

The object sited was a light which first appeared to be a star, but later began moving rapidly and erratically. Two jet interceptors were scrambled to investigate the object, but it disappeared before they could make visual contact. The pilots reported that the object made a rapid and sudden change in direction and speed, unlike any known aircraft. Ground observers also reported seeing the object. The incident was well within our radar coverage, but no targets were plotted.

Weather conditions were clear and visibility was good. There was no indication of any atmospheric phenomena which could have caused the sighting.
