AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

Statement by S/Sgt Robert Lahey

On the night of 25 July 1953, at 2:30 hours, there was called by Base Operations and advised of some unidentified lights to the East. I went out on the east wall to have a look and saw some (7) and eight to the East of the tower. I went to the tower and got the camera. I couldn't tell the altitude or how far they were. The light seem to be going straight up.

23 November 1953

Dear Capt. Hardin:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just now gotten down to looking over the large batch of accumulated reports. I must say that compared with Black Hawk, none of these approaches that incident in interest. There are a few interesting sightings, but on none of these is information sufficient to make a follow-up profitable.

Of the interesting ones, the very similar sightings of 24 July and 1 August at Key West would warrant follow-up if they were more recent. With present information I have no suggested explanation.

The 26 July Perrin AFB Texas also holds possible interest from the standpoint of man-hours and the fact they were observed from the Control Tower and by civilians of Denison, Texas.

It is too bad there is not more information on Creola, Ala. These cases cover four separate days. There is possibly pay dirt in these.

Finally, the Sidi Slimane sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably have to remain on the books as unexplained.

As for the remaining 30 or so, there is so little information concerning those which do not have obvious explanations that there is no percentage whatever in considering them seriously.

Thus, out of the total number there are 4 independent sets which, if staff and time were available, would be interesting to pursue. Personally, I vote for sticking with the Black Hawk case until we have squeezed it dry. I feel certain that if this case can be explained, others would follow suit.

Concerning the Black Hawk case, we are proceeding slowly but surely with the investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the evidence. Since the observations covered several hours and sightings were both visual and radar, it is important, in my estimation, that we continue to pursue this since failure to identify points a possible real weakness in our defense setup. I hope to have a preliminary report on this case for you soon.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

Statement by A/2B Thomas M. Davis Jr.

Base Operations advised us of the presence of the lights east of the field. There were seven of them. Color was red. They were fairly well grouped together. Each 1/4 m as an A/C would show on the flight line was shown though the objects were making toward us. OCI was advised, but placed in waiting. The lights shown from 13 to 20°. The best phase was located in the ten o'clock position. Located at the base perimeter. Only effect noticed was to make them look bigger. No object other than the light could be seen. At 250 the object seemed to just drift up slowly. Cord of alt. A few 1200 as estimated. Aircraft was placed up by 120 as 160.

Text of handwritten response:
To answer to #33: I can't say what it was, but don't think it was a trailing of aircraft. It's not likely that a formation of seven aircraft would lose right wing lights at same time. Might have been me so they couldn't have flicked out any existing right wing lights.

Couldn't estimate distance or speed at the objects were moving toward us and up, and without knowing intensity of the light on the type of it we couldn't estimate distance.

                    AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(1)    Seven (7) objects were sighted by all the sources. Objects were
spherical in shape and had a red light which appeared to be on the bottom of the
object. The formation was in a chevron or V-shaped formation. They were
sighted in the vicinity of Perrin Air Force Base, Texas, and remained in sight
for the longest period of time. The
speed of the objects was continuously observed all stayed in the same relative
position unchanged. (No estimate of speed was possible due to lack of ground
reference.)

(2)    The objects were sighted at 2139 hours, Central Standard Time, 25 July 1953.

(3)    Observation was visual from the ground.

(4)    Observers were from Perrin Air Force Base, Texas. Position 963rd. AC&W Sq, 963rd AC&W Sq, 3370th
Tech Sq, 3370th Tech Sq. Latitude 33°45', Longitude 97°13'. Direction
of objects from the observers at Perrin was North North West, distance was approximately
five (5) miles at a maximum. Altitude of objects was approximately 12,000 feet.
First sighting and ground visual observation was at an
altitude of approximately 12,000 feet, with a slow, deliberate, uninterrupted
movement at an estimated altitude of 3000 feet.

(5)    With the exception of Airman Smith, none of the observers have previously
experienced similar sightings. All observers were interrogated and their
statements were found to be consistent.

(6)    The sky was clear, visibility 25 miles, winds aloft 200 to 600 feet
from 270° to 290° (35) to eleven (36) knots.

(7)    [Text appears to be illegible or obscured]

(8)    [Text appears to be illegible or obscured]

(9)    As of the middle three were no photos available at Perrin. An attempt was made to
obtain photos but negative results.

(10)   An unidentified aircraft was detected by ECI Radar at Perrin shortly
after the sighted objects disappeared. A plane of the Texas Central Airport due
west of Ardmore, Oklahoma was due in the area at that time.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

I was sitting in my backyard and spotted there over (7) red lights at an estimated altitude of four (4) or five (5) miles at about two (2) miles to 210 Saturday night, 23 July 1953. These objects (8) appeared to be approximately (10) miles, six of these lights stayed in a identical position without raising or lowering, relatively east of these lights tilted two one light, approximately to (2) or three (3) thousand feet above the others. Some time constantly, to the end of approximately ten (10) minutes, the boy light that tilted all the time began to move straight up in the air without any moving from others sides. I was at all (9) after 10 remained approximately at (8) or (10) thousand feet. Then (10) thousand feet, the other six lights began to move in the same relative position to each other, straight up in the same manner in which the first light began its ascent. They continued to move somewhat similar at (10) or (11) thousand feet. They began to pop out like they were turned out with a light switch all the tilting. Three (3) of the lower six (6) lights remained in eight for some couple or nine minutes. Lights began to fade and a lot of night as if they were going behind a cloud. I was at first at distance I made an estimate of the angles from where to leave to the earth. I was leaving at this object were about 40° rising from where. It is estimated to be a couple of miles. It was like a big yellow light. The lights looked like my ceiling in lights. The light on top of radio station looking just like my ceiling in lights. The light on top of radio station looking just like my ceiling lights.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

STATEMENT BY [redacted]

Objects were sighted in the sky Saturday night July 25, 1953 commencing approximately 9:30 P.M. They were first observed by me from the second floor of the Denison Herald Building in down-town Denison and first noticed a point of approximately 30 degrees up on the horizon. When first seen they were a little east of south and were strung out in almost a straight line with the point directing straight upward. The objects consisted of several small lights through field glasses, each unit consisted of several smaller lights at least eight or ten in number and these seemed to move slowly more or less in unison within the larger unit.

These objects gave the impression of flying in a sort of tandem formation. From the straight line first seen, the last three objects went into triangular formation and the others changed position position to form a resemblance to the Great Dipper or an inverted question mark. From that formation they stretched into a different formation of triangles at either end. These would vary around in more or less a drifting pattern and finally then they reached a point directly overhead, then went out of sight in almost a direct line.

At this time, fifteen or twenty minutes later than time objects were first sighted, by an east 20 degrees north of the formation sighted, another object was seen blinking out first and were followed a few seconds later with others disappearing in turn until they were all gone; making, perhaps, a total of ten or twelve objects in all. For several minutes later for a brief period, perhaps three or four seconds, two of the objects in the middle of the string went out at the same time. These objects were very bright and during the entire light was visible at close distance, I would estimate that these objects were 1500 to 1800 feet up in the sky. No lights traveled in direction parallel to the horizon, but when observed they came almost directly overhead a few degrees off to the West.

After that, disappeared a plane appeared in the sky at approximately 10:15 P.M. A plane of the Texas Central Airport due out of Ardmore Oklahoma due over Denison at that time. These objects were sighted by several people in the area over Denison that night. The telephone operators of the Denison Herald were kept busy ringing for hours with people requesting the nature of these lights. In fact, the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, the service here, had to put on air extra operators to handle the calls.

Statement by A/2c Larry N. Shinns

At 2:30 pm 26 August we called to an area, we observed, and sighted in the west, 1000 feet above ground level, 3 objects, round in shape, metallic looking, bright. Making to the west to the sun appeared to be some red lights. Approximately just above horizon. They looked just like toy lights of an aircraft. The only difference was they were rising very slowly. We took pictures of these with a starscope to help in the tower the west portion. We took about 10 pictures at different times. Joined one. Throughout their ascent, they appeared to keep the same formation except one, which was to the upper right. Still one light drifted further apart from the others. Well within the 1000 ft altitude and right off. But this could have been the atmospheric condition.

Any indication of altitude was practically impossible, also we did not know the aim of the lights may determine their direction from the tower.
