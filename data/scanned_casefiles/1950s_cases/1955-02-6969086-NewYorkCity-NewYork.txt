HEADQUARTERS
4602d AIR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SQUADRON (ADC)
ENI AIR FORCE BASE
COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO

SUBJECT: UFOB Report                                     4 May 1955

TO:   Commander
       Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: Captain Charles Hardin (UFOB's)
       Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
       Dayton, Ohio

1. Enclosed is UFOB Report transmitted to this Squadron by Hq, 
26th AD (Defense).

2. This Squadron concurs in the hypothesis of the Preparing
Officer that the sighting was possibly caused by search light activity.
There have already been other reports from this same vicinity caused
by similar phenomena (see, e.g., sighting of 4 and 5 March, sources:
                                    place: New York City). Due to the improbability at this time of gaining much more information, there will be no
further investigation in this matter.

   i. Negative.

2. a. Observers happened to turn toward window and saw object.
   b. Angle of elevation 30 - 60 degrees, (varied during the three sightings);
      azimuth 0 - 30 degrees (also varied according to individual sightings)
   c. Elevation 30 - 60 degrees, azimuth 0 - 30 degrees.
   d. During each of the three sightings, the individual object remained at
      the same altitude, but each was observed to be at a different altitude. The third
      object, when initially sighted, was heading due south over Central Park, New York

      disappeared while moving due north.
   e. Objects disappeared out of range of vision.

10. A large number of aircraft were in the area at the time. New York CAA
    report that it would be very difficult to state the exact number, due to the time
    lapse since the report and also because CAA does not have records of many of the
    flights in the area.

11. GEORGE J. HALEY, Captain, USAF, Director of Intelligence, 26th Air Division
    (Def) Roslyn AFS, Roslyn, N.Y.

    The Manhattan, Brooklyn and Long Island areas have been very active with
    power search light operations. Search light teams reflecting from the smoke or haze
    layer or from low cloud decks and with otherwise good night visibility, tend impulse
    to observation of unknown air activity. A search light orbit is apt to appear as
    though suddenly reversed (in direction) (Ref para 2) and lack of a reflecting cloud
    surface would make the object disappear.

    I have no doubt the objects observed were both the result of search light
    activity and the reflection on under surfaces of low ranging clouds.

12. Negative.
