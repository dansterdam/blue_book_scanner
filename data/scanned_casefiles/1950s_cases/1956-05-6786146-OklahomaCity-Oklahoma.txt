ACCORDING TO A NEWSPAPER REPORT FROM 26 MAY 1956, A CREW ON BOARD A NORWEGIAN FISHING VESSEL OBSERVED A "FANTASTIC" UFO OVER THE SEA. THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY RELATED THAT THEY OBSERVED A SO-CALLED "FLYING SAUCER" PREVIOUSLY. THEY SAID THAT THE OBJECT MOVED WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED, AND THEY ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF AN AVERAGE COMMERCIAL AIRLINER. IT APPEARED TO THEM AS A SOLID, LUMINOUS OBJECT WHICH SHOT THROUGH THE AIR.

Streak of lightning across the sky and vanished. A moment later, however, it reappeared, ascended in a straight line so that the men were able to see clearly the unusual glowing object just below the. The object remained steady like a while that was suddenly illuminated. Finally it worked up speed once more and disappeared across the shore line.
There is no doubt whatever, it was a flying saucer they saw. The object for a time stayed as close to the ship as to allow photographers to be taken as that bright object had only dawned upon them. The crew had cameras on board but in the heat of the excitement, no one thought of using them until it was too late.
We judge it to be about twice the size of an average commercial airliner. It moved at a speed so great that it actually shot like a streak of lightning through the air.
A number of trawlers were fishing in this area where the object was in training. The weather was fine with bright sunshine and almost no wind, with clear atmosphere up to an altitude of 3000 meters, so it is beyond all doubt that the men on the spot saw the object.
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: The Norwegian Intelligence Service has been approached concerning this observation, and has no additional information to indicate the nature of this phenomenon.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from a report on the observation of a "flying saucer" by crew members on a Norwegian ship in the White Sea. The text describes the object as remaining stationary in the air for about an hour, and that all binoculars on board were in use to observe the curious object. The report states that the saucer was then completely stationary, and the crew rushed up on deck to see the phenomenon.

FLYING SAUCER OBSERVED

The object was observed by the crew of the Norwegian ship near Norefjorden and Teribergka in the White Sea a few days ago. The newspaper states that for about an hour the saucer performed various maneuvers over the ship. The saucer hid through the air, remained stationary for a while and then disappeared behind a mass on shore. The object was right down to one thousand meters and all binoculars on board were in use.
