                464/1 -

ACCORDING TO A NEWSPAPER REPORT FROM TROMS ON 26 MAY 1956 THE CREW ON BOARD A TROMS SHIP HAS STATED THAT THEY HAVE WITNESSED A FANTASTIC PHENOMENON OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY NEAR MURMANSK AND TERIBERKA IN THE SEA A FEW DAYS PREVIOUSLY. THEY RELATED THAT THEY OBSERVED A SO-CALLED FLYING SAUCER PERFORMING VARIOUS MANEUVERS OVER THE SHIP AND THAT IT PERFORMED WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED. THEY ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS ABOVE TWICE THE SIZE OF AN AVERAGE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE, AND THAT IT "ACTUALLY SHOT LIKE A STREAK OF LIGHT THROUGH THE AIR."

streak of lightning across the sky and vanished. A moment later, however, it reappeared, ascended in a straight line so that the men were able to see clearly the round disc. Just like a disc. The saucer remained still for a while, high up in the air, but then descended once more, and remained at an altitude of about one thousand meters. Finally it worked up speed once more and disappeared across the shore line.

There is no doubt whatever among the ship's crew that it was a flying saucer they saw. The object for a time stayed as close to the ship as to allow photographs to be taken if that bright thought had only dawned upon them. The crew had cameras on board but in the heat of the excitement no one thought of using them until it was too late.

"To us it was a real aircraft we saw," said the newspaper's informant, "but of an entirely unknown type. We estimate it to be about twice the size of an average commercial airliner. It moved at a speed so great that it actually shot like a streak of lightning through the air."

"A whole fleet of foreign travelers was flashing in this area where the object was in training. The weather was fine with bright sunshine and almost no wind, with clear atmosphere up to an altitude of 3000 meters, so it is beyond all doubt that the men on the travelers have seen the same thing as we did."

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: The Norwegian Intelligence Service has been approached concerning this observation, and has no additional information to indicate

1. Following is press release from Norwegian newspaper VERDENS GANG dated May 26, 1956:

FLYING SAUCER OBSERVED

The following is reported from Troms by private cable on May 26, 1956:
The crew on board a Troms ship was related to the newspaper "Nordlys" of a fantastic phenomenon which they witnessed off the Russian coast between Murmansk and Teriberk in the White Sea a few days ago. The men relate that for about one quarter of an hour they observed a so-called flying saucer performing various maneuvers over the ship. The saucer whistled through the air, remained stationary for a while and then disappeared behind a ness on shore. The object was right down to one thousand meters and all binoculars on board were in use.

"There is a hole in the sky," shouted the last officer when he spotted the curious object. The saucer was then completely stationary and the crew rushed up on deck to see the phenomenon. All of a sudden the saucer worked up speed, shot like a
