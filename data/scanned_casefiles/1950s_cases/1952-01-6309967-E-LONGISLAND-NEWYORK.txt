Bright yellowish orange light came out of the sky from traveling in a high rate of speed on a horizontal course. As the light approached, it seemed to get brighter and gain speed, appearing to a tall. It disintegrated by exploding.

AT: THIS POINT OF VIEWING, THE LIGHT CHANGED - SHAPE
VERY RAPIDLY - SHOWING - PART OF ORANGE LIGHT AND
ASCENDING A BLUE-WHITE CRESCENT WHICH SEEMED TO
COME OUT OF PARTS OR JETS.

I WAS LOOKING AT
THE TAIL END OF IT
OBJECT AT THIS POINT
ALT. 2-3 DEGREES ABOVE
IT MUST BE A LONG
TUBULAR - GUIDED
MISSILE OF GREAT
SIZE.

LIGHT APPROACHED
FROM S.E. HORIZON
AT A VERTICAL
ANGLE.

POINT OF OBSERVATION

HEAVILY POPULATED
SMALL HOME AREA.

HOUSE
OBSTRUCTED BY
TREE, POINT
OF FIXATION.

THIS OBJECT VEERED INTO THE DIRECTION OF
"WITCH FIELD AIR BASE" AND EXPLODED IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE "BROOK HAVEN ATOMIC LABORATORIES" FROM
MY POINT OF OBSERVATION.

THE NIGHT WAS DARK (NO MOON & MISTY) AND IMPOSSIBLE
TO SEE ANY OUTLINE OF THE OBJECT.

MISSILE APPROACHING IN
DARK: FRACT. THIS SHELL
SHOWED ONLY EXHAUST FLAMES

TRAIL VIEW

ORANGE & BLUE CRESCENTS

CONVERGING THIS ANGLE SHOWED A DEFINITE
DARK OUTLINE - THESE FORCES FOCAL IT MOST AS
A TANGIBLE PROJECTILE

PROBABLY THE CRESCENT LIGHTS SEEM
TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF FLYING SOURCES

TOGET. OR SPEED PUSHED
THE ALMSFRS INTO SPACE. ~

SEVERAL RAPID FLASHES - FULL

THE SPEED MUST PUSH THIS
FLASH OVER A LARGE AREA

THIS SKETCH SHOWS THEORY OF GREEN FLASHES AS
THEY WOULD APPEAR - FROM A SIDE VIEW.

BEING IN A TECHNICAL FIELD AND HAVING EXPERIENCE
WITH VARIOUS METALS, I HAVE OBSERVED - THAT COPPER,
COPPER DUST OR SHAVINGS IN A FLAME HAVE ALWAYS
PRODUCED A GREEN LIGHT. PERHAPS THIS MISSILE
MAY BE COMPOSED OF SOME COPPER ELEMENTS.

POINT OF
OBSERVATION
FLUSHING, N.Y.

APPROX. DIRECTION
WHERE FADED WAS SEEN

LONG ISLAND
N.Y.

A LIGHT SIMILAR TO THOSE ON AN AIRPLANE,
CAME OUT OF THE SOUTH EASTERN HORIZON,
AND IT CAME CLOSER, IT VEERED TO A NORTH
EASTERN DIRECTION.

THIS LIGHT TRAVELED IN A HORIZONTAL COURSE
THEREFORE I FEEL IT WAS NOT A METEOR.

The document also contains a compass rose/directional indicator and a hand-drawn map showing locations like Long Island and Flushing, NY, with various flight paths or observation lines.

Here is the text from the document:

(1) THE BALL OF LIGHT APPEARED SIDE IN SHAPE AND BRIGHT YELLOW-ORANGE IN COLOR.

(2) AS THE LIGHT APPROACHED, IT SEEMED TO GET BRIGHTER AND GAIN SPEED AS IT VEERED EASTWARD ON VEERING, A BLUE-WHITE CRESCENT AND PURE LIKE LIGHT, BEGAN TO APPEAR ON THE TAIL END.

(3) ON 175 EASTWARD COURSE - THERE WAS A SUDDEN FLASH, SMALL IN SIZE, THEN IT BEGAN TO BLOOM LARGER AND LARGER, LIGHTING ITS WHOLE MASS WITH A GREEN COLORED DAY LIGHT.

THE PLUS MINUS OF THE LIGHT GIVEN SHADES AS SEEN IN 18 SECONDS

LOW LYING CLOUDS EXPOSED ON THE HORIZON BY THE LIGHT

BRILLIANT WHITE GREEN LIGHT OF CENTER - BRIGHT NO DAYLIGHT

ACTUAL DESCRIPTION OF FLASH IN FULL BLOOM

THE WHOLE EPISODE - FROM FIRST FLASH TO FULL BLOOM - LASTED APPROXIMATELY 5 SECONDS

Here is the text from the document:

THE ORANGE-YELLOW LIGHT COULD
BE THE FLASH OF JETS.

THE SIDE CRESCENT COULD
HAVE BEEN THE EXHAUST
OF JETS AS IT BEGAN TO
VEER ON ITS COURSE.
(SIMILAR TO THAT OF
JET AIRPLANE ENGINE EXHAUST)

DEVELOPING BLUE-
WHITE TRAIL-LIGHT
MOVING IN A
