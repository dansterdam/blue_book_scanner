AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

At 1325, 21 August 1952, a report was received from the Baltimore Ground Observer Corps Filter Center stating that a report had been made by a traveller, who observed an unconventional object as 08S52, 26 miles 1952 while travelling on U.S. Highway 13, south of Salisbury, Maryland. Subject was described as a bright battalion, green in color, with a brass button, and closed like the mouth to the 3 inch. Object was flying at a rate of a medium watch dial. Object was in view some two seconds.

This is no prank.

This report tends to lend further credence to two-conventional explanations of time-eventful real objects in the sky.

[The rest of the text is handwritten and appears to be a detailed description of some event or observation. However, due to the cursive and somewhat dense handwriting, parts of it are difficult to fully transcribe with complete certainty. The text appears to discuss some kind of observation or incident involving distances, measurements, and directional details. The writing covers most of the page in a continuous paragraph format.]

The text begins with what seems to be a detailed account, but the specific details are challenging to transcribe with 100% accuracy due to the handwriting style.
