As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets if necessary.

A few additional comments from my study of this report:

1. The high speed and maneuverability of the object as described would seem to indicate a technological capability far beyond anything presently known to exist in conventional aircraft.
2. The multiple changes in direction, altitude, and speed suggest an advanced form of propulsion and control system, as opposed to something being blown about by the wind. 
3. The fact that the object was observed by several witnesses independently over a period of time lends credence to the report.
4. The apparent metallic or reflective nature of the object, as mentioned, is also an unusual characteristic.
5. The apparent ability to accelerate and change direction rapidly without apparent effect on the object or the observers is very unusual.
6. The estimate of the object's size as approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter would indicate something much larger than a conventional aircraft or balloon.

In summary, while I cannot of course draw any conclusions as to the nature or origin of the observed object, the details provided do seem to describe phenomena that are not easily explained in conventional terms. Further investigation would be warranted to try to determine if this was indeed an advanced technological craft of some kind, or perhaps some other unusual natural or man-made phenomenon.
