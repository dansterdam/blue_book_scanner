Here is the text from the newspaper clipping:

Explorer III Died
Quietly, Perhaps
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 28
(UP) — American satellite Explorer
III apparently died on or about last night, with no explanation, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory said today.

A top official said there had been no confirmed sighting of Explorer III since 10:30 p.m. Friday at the Minitrack Team, where the artificial moon appeared and other specialists here detected Explorer III would burn up in the Earth's atmosphere perhaps by night.

Smithsonian scientists discussed several sightings Friday night in Connecticut, Arizona and over the Atlantic. It could not be learned whether Explorer III would pass over the southern half of the United States last night.

There is also handwritten text at the top of the page: "Sgt. Clean. Keep this out a reminder the next few days."

And some handwritten text at the bottom of the page, but it is partially illegible.
