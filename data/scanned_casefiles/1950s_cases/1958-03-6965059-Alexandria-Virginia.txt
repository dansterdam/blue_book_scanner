Alexandria, Va.
March 23, 1958

Dear Sir:

At about 11:30 P.M. this evening as I was returning home, I noticed a strange light in the heavens which I could not identify - one had I ever seen anything like it before.

The light was orange to yellowish, about the brightness of "Casturis", and near the size of a star in this patch of sky. The object had no tail such as a comet, nor did it seem to have wings. It appeared in the NNW and traveled the sky in about 10-12 seconds (roughly) passing between the 22d + 32 class in the handle of the Big Dipper and just north of the Polar Star. The object moved at a uniform rate and disappeared in the E.S.E.

If this report is of any value to you can you let me know and I would appreciate hearing from you.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

Dear Mr.

Thank you for your letter of 23 March 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object.

A check of earth satellite orbital tracks indicate the object was not a satellite.

Although the object has not been conclusively identified, a tentative analysis indicates that it probably was a meteor.

Your report will be used as a part of our continuous study and investigation of aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,
