a significant number of fairly complete reports by reliable observers remained unexplained. Although no evidence existed that unexplained reports of sightings constituted a physical threat to the security of the U. S., in March, 1952, the Air Force decided that all reports of unidentified aerial objects should be investigated and evaluated to determine if "flying saucers" represented technological developments not known to this country.

Originally, the problem involved the preparation and analysis of about 1,300 reports accumulated by the Air Force between 1947 and the end of March, 1952. During the course of the work, the number of reports submitted for analysis and evaluation more than tripled, the result of the unprecedented increase in observations during 1952. Accordingly, this study is based on a number of reports considered to be large enough for a preliminary statistical analysis, approximately 4,000 reports.

This study was undertaken primarily to categorize the available reports of sightings and to determine the probability that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects represented observations of "flying saucers". With full cognizance of the quality of the data available for study, yet with an awareness of the proportions this subject has assumed at times in the public mind, this work was undertaken with all the seriousness accorded to a straightforward scientific investigation. In order to establish the probability that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects represented observations of "flying saucers", it was necessary to make an attempt to answer the question "What is a 'flying saucer'?". However, it must be emphasized that this was only incidental to the primary purpose of the study, the determination of the probability that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects represented observations of "flying saucers", as defined on Page 1.

The basic technique for this study consisted of reducing the available data to a form suitable for mechanical manipulation, a prerequisite for the application of preliminary statistical methods. One of International Business Machine Corporation's systems was chosen as the best available mechanical equipment.

The reduction of data contained in sighting reports into a form suitable for transfer to IBM punched cards was extremely difficult and time consuming.

For this study a panel of consultants was formed, consisting of both experts within and outside ATIC. During the course of the work, guidance and advice were received from the panel. The professional experience available from the panel covered major scientific fields and numerous specialized fields.

All records and working papers of this study have been carefully preserved in an orderly fashion suitable for ready reference. These

(3) Case III does not satisfy Condition 1. It also does not satisfy Condition 4 when Case II is eliminated as a good UNKNOWN.

(4) Case IV does not satisfy Conditions 1 or 2. There are few cigar-shaped or rocket-shaped objects reported in the literature. In addition, this observer is not considered to be well-qualified technically.

(5) Case V does not satisfy Condition 1. It also does not satisfy Condition 4 when Case IV is eliminated as a good UNKNOWN.

It might be argued here that many of the UNKNOWNS might actually have shapes similar to these good UNKNOWNS. It will be noted, however, that each of these five cases does not satisfy one of the other three conditions.

(6) Case VI does not satisfy Condition 2. In the description of the object, it was stated that at certain times there was no light seen from the object. Apparently, the "band of no light", as diagrammed by the observer, was an attempt to explain this. However, if the object were constructed as shown in the diagram, light should have been seen at all times. Because of this conflict the drawing is not considered reliable, and without the drawing, there is not enough detail in the description to make it useful for this study.

(7) Case VII violates Conditions 1 and 4. Although the shape is disc-like, the maneuvers performed by the object are unique both among the UNKNOWNS and among the good UNKNOWNS.

Cases VIII to XII satisfy Conditions 1 through 3, but they do not satisfy Condition 4. The features which make them different from each other are as follows:

(8) Case VIII. The object is smooth, with no protrusions or other details.

(9) Case IX. The object had rocket or jet pods on each side that were shooting out flames.

(10) Case X. The object had a fin or rudder.

(11) Case XI. The object had a series of portholes, or windows, on its under side.

ORIGIN AND NATURE OF DATA

Reports of sightings were received by the U. S. Air Force from a
representative cross section of the population of the U. S., and varied
widely in completeness and quality. Included were reports from reputable
scientists, housewives, farmers, students, and technically trained mem-
bers of the Armed Forces. Reports varied in length from a few sentences
stating that a "flying saucer" had been sighted, to those containing thou-
sands of words, including description, speculation, and advice on how to
handle the "problem of the flying saucers!". Some reports were of high
quality, conservative, and as complete as the observer could make them;
a few originated from people confined to mental institutions. A critical
examination of the reports revealed, however, that a high percentage of
them was submitted by serious people, mystified by what they had seen and
motivated by patriotic responsibility.

Three principal sources of reports were noted in the preliminary
review of the data. The bulk of the data arrived at A TIC through regular
military channels, from June, 1947, until the middle of 1952.

A second type of data consisted of letters reporting sightings sent by
civilian observers directly to ATIC. Most of these direct communications
were dated subsequent to April 30, 1952, and are believed to be the result
of a suggestion by a popular magazine that future reports be directed to the
Air Technical Intelligence Center. As could be expected, a large number
of letters was received following this publicity.

A third type of data was that contained in questionnaire forms com-
pleted by the observer himself. A questionnaire form, developed during
the course of this study, was mailed by ATIC to a selected group of writers
of direct letters with the request that the form be completed and returned.
Approximately 1,000 responses were received by ATIC.

In general, the data were subjective, consisting of qualified estimates
of physical characteristics rather than of precise measurements. Further-
more, most of the reports were not reduced to written form immediately.
The time between sighting and report varied from one day to several years.
Both of these factors introduced an element of doubt concerning the validity
of the original data, and increased its subjectivity. This was intensified by
the recognized inability of the average individual to estimate speeds, dis-
tances, and sizes of objects in the air with any degree of accuracy. In
spite of these limitations, methods of statistical analysis of such reports in
sufficiently large groups are valid. The danger lies in the possibility of

forgetting the subjectivity of the data at the time that conclusions are
drawn from the analysis. It must be emphasized, again and again, that any
conclusions contained in this report are based NOT on facts, but on what
many observers thought and estimated the true facts to be.

Altogether, the data for this study consisted of approximately 4,000
reports of sightings of unidentified aerial objects. The majority were re-
ceived through military channels or in the form of observer-completed
questionnaires; a few were accepted in the form of direct letters from un-
questionably reliable sources. Sightings made between June, 1947, and
December, 1952, were considered for this study. Sightings alleged to have
occurred prior to 1947 were not considered, since they were not reported
to official sources until after public interest in "flying saucers" had been
stimulated by the popular press.

REDUCTION OF DATA TO MECHANIZED COMPUTATION FORM

As received by the Air Technical Intelligence Center, the sighting
reports were not in a form suitable for even a quasi-scientific study. A
preliminary review of the data indicated the need for standardized interro-
gation procedures and supplemental forms for the reduction of currently
held and subsequently acquired data to a form amenable to scientific
appraisal.

The plan for reduction of the data to usable form consisted of a pro-
gram of development comprising four major steps: (1) a systematic listing
of the factors necessary to evaluate the observer and his report, and to
identify the unknown object observed; (2) a standard scheme for the trans-
fer of data to a mechanized computation system; (3) an orderly means of
relating the original data to all subsequent forms; and (4) a consistent pro-
cedure for the identification of the phenomenon described by the original
data.

Questionnaire

The first reports received by ATIC varied widely in completeness
and quality. Air Force Letter 200-5(2) and Air Force Form 112(1) were
attempts to fix responsibility for and improve the quality of the reports of
sightings. To coordinate past efforts and to provide standardization for the

(1) A modified Air Force Form 112 lists pertinent questions to be answered in regard to an unidentified-object
sighting.

(2) Air Force Letter 200-5 places responsibility with the Air Force for the investigation, reporting, and
analysis of unidentified aerial objects. This letter is dated 29 April 1952.

future, it was imperative to develop a questionnaire form listing the factors necessary for evaluation of the observer and his report, and identification of the unknown objects. In addition, it was decided that such a questionnaire should be designed to serve as an interrogator's guide, and as a form for the observer himself to complete when personal interrogation was not possible or practicable.

Ideally, a questionnaire for the purposes required should contain questions pertaining to all technical details considered to be essential for the statistical approach, and should serve to obtain a maximum of information from the average individual who had made a sighting in the past or would be likely to be reporting sightings in the future. Besides these discrete facts, an integrated written description of a sighting would be required, thus enabling the reported facts of the sighting to be corroborated. Also, a narrative description might allow subtle questions to be answered concerning the observer's ability, such as indirect questions that would reveal his reasoning ability, suggestibility, and general mental attitude.

As a whole, then, the information contained in a questionnaire should make possible the classification and evaluation of the sighting, the rating of the observer, the probability of accuracy of reported facts, and the identification of what was reported as unidentified.

During the course of this project, three questionnaire forms were developed, each intended to be an improved revision of the one preceding. The improvements were suggested and confirmed by members of the panel of consultants connected with this project.

The original form was evolved by the panel of consultants as their first work on this project. It was intended to allow the start of the reduction of reports to discrete data, and was immediately subjected to extensive review and revision by the panel. The revised (second) form was subjected to a trial test before adoption. ATIC sent a copy to observers reporting sightings, with the request that the form be completed and returned. Of the first 300 questionnaires returned during July and August, 1952, 168 were analyzed by a consulting psychologist. On the basis of this analysis, plus the experience gained in working with past reports, the final form of the questionnaire - the U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet - was evolved. Copies of the three forms of the questionnaire, in the order of their development, are shown as Exhibits B1, B2, and B3 in Appendix B.

In order to implement the transcription of data from past sighting reports, each succeeding form was put to use as soon as it was developed and approved. Accordingly, experience was obtained with each form in relation to past data, an important factor in the improvement of the quality and completeness of the later reports included in this study.

Coding System and Work Sheet

The reduction of non-numerical data to numerical form is mandatory in the machine handling of data. Thus, the selection of the IBM punched-card system for analysis of data forced the adoption of a master coding plan. Since it was impracticable to transfer detailed data of an exact nature from the questionnaire to the IBM card, an intermediate transfer form, coordinated with the master code, was necessary.

The master coding plan was evolved during the early stages of the preliminary analysis of data, and was reviewed by the panel of consultants before use. It was recognized that this system of coding would be the heart of the analysis, that is, the completeness of the facility for translation of data could make or break the study. Accordingly, every conceivable factor that might influence the identification of unidentified aerial objects was included, together with a wide range of variations within each factor. The original coding system (with minor corrections) was used throughout the translation of the original data with marked success. A copy of this system, called CODES, is enclosed as Exhibit B4, Appendix B.

To facilitate the preparation of the punched-card abstract, an intermediate form called the WORK SHEET (later, the CARD BIBLE) was developed. Referenced to both the data from the questionnaire and the system of report identification, the WORK SHEET permitted an orderly transcription of data simultaneously by several people. In conjunction with the CODES, the WORK SHEET was used during the reduction of the original data to code form necessary for transfer to punched cards. A sample is included as Exhibit B5, Appendix B.

After the analysis was under way, it became apparent that the mechanics of machine processing could be improved by incorporating in the IBM card system group classifications of certain factors requiring more than one column for discrete expression. In addition, the inclusion of certain data relating to the evaluation and bearing of the sun with respect to the observer was considered necessary. Finally, a critical examination of certain segments of the data indicated the need for the definition of a new factor relating to the maneuvers of the object or objects sighted. Prior to the start of the analytical study, it had been assumed that a combination of stated factors would, by inference, define the maneuver pattern.

All these additions have been incorporated in a revised set of CODES and CARD BIBLE that are illustrated as Exhibits B6 and B7, Appendix B. However, at the time that the maneuver factor was determined to be critical, it was physically impracticable to make the required definitions and re-evaluate the original data. Therefore, no code for maneuverability has been included in the CODES, CARD BIBLE, or IBM cards.

Identification of Working Papers

The actual reduction of data to IBM punched-card form presented a problem of mass transfer of figures by several workers. Recognizing that an orderly system of relating the original data to the questionnaire, the WORK SHEET, and the IBM card was imperative, a scheme of SERIAL NUMBERS was developed to answer this need.

The first data consisted of a series of letter-file folders identified by the year and location of the sighting or sightings they contained. The number of reports of sightings in a single folder varied from 1 to over 20. Under these conditions, there was a great possibility for incorrect transcription of data, duplication of transcription, or misplacement of intermediate forms. Further, it was considered desirable to relate all sightings of the same object or objects to one another. The concept of a four-digit serial number (major), followed by a two-digit subserial number (minor), was adequate to fulfill these requirements.

To expedite handling of the data, temporary serial numbers were assigned until each report had been evaluated and the phenomenon had been placed in a category of identification. The use of temporary serial numbers permitted the consolidation of duplicate reports from apparently diverse sources, such as a teletype message and an Air Force Form 112. However, this consolidation was made ONLY when it could be proved conclusively that the sources of the two documents were one and the same. Factors of the observer's location, date and time of observation, description of the phenomenon, and finally, the name of the observer were considered. In this manner, the assignment of major serial and minor serial numbers in continuous series was made only to the reports accepted for the statistical study. It is believed that the reports accepted represent unique and unduplicated instances of sightings.

In the establishment of the serial-number system, it was necessary to define certain terms, so that a standard interpretation could be achieved. The terms and corresponding definitions were:

OBSERVER – Any witness reporting to a proper authority that he had seen unidentified aerial objects.

SIGHTING – The report or group of reports of the same observed phenomenon that remained unidentified to the observer or observers, at least until reported.

SINGLE OBSERVATION - A SIGHTING consisting of a single report from (1) one OBSERVER with no knowledge of additional OBSERVERS of the same phenomenon, or (2) a group of witnesses of the same phenomenon, each cognizant of the others. The witness who made the report is called a SINGLE OBSERVER.

MULTIPLE OBSERVATION - A SIGHTING consisting of several reports from OBSERVERS of the same phenomenon who were cognizant of each other. The witnesses who made reports are called MULTIPLE OBSERVERS.

ALL SIGHTINGS - (1) The group of reports consisting of one report for each OBSERVER, including both SINGLE and MULTIPLE OBSERVERS, (2) The questionnaire, work sheet, and IBM card representing the report from each OBSERVER - in other words, the representation of each report accepted for the statistical study.

UNIT SIGHTINGS - (1) The group of reports consisting of one report for each SIGHTING, including all the reports of SINGLE OBSERVATIONS and the one most representative report from each MULTIPLE OBSERVATION. (2) The questionnaire, work sheet, and IBM card representing the report for each SIGHTING accepted for the statistical study.

A major serial number (four digits) was assigned to each sighting, segregating the year of occurrence by selection of limits for each year, as follows:

0001 to 0500 reserved for 1947
0501 to 1000 reserved for 1948
1001 to 1500 reserved for 1949
1501 to 2000 reserved for 1950
2001 to 2500 reserved for 1951
2501 to 4900 reserved for 1952

While this scheme would serve to identify any individual sighting, identification of each report and its subsequent forms was necessary. The minor subserial numbers (two digits) fulfilled this requirement. For all SINGLE OBSERVATIONS, 2759, 00, was sufficient identification. For MULTIPLE OBSERVATIONS, the major serial number followed by a series of two-digit numbers ranging from 00 to 99 was used to identify the individual reports. In general, the most complete report from the most reliable observer of that

The tables contain numerous numerical entries, percentages, and calculations, but due to the complexity and density of the data, I cannot confidently transcribe all specific numbers without risking error.

The tables seem to be part of a systematic analysis of UFO sightings, categorizing and quantifying observations by duration and other characteristics.


- page 78 -

MULTIPLE OBSERVATION was identified with the .00 subserial number.
As an example, a MULTIPLE OBSERVATION consisting of six sighting
reports would have the following serial numbers:

1132.00 representing the best report and observer
1132.01 representing an additional observer
1132.02 representing an additional observer
1132.03 representing an additional observer
1132.04 representing an additional observer
1132.05 representing an additional observer

During the course of the transcription of the data to machine card
form, it became obvious that certain reports could have been independent
observations of the same phenomenon. So, if the presentation of an
analysis based on one report for each sighting was valid (the concept of
UNIT SIGHTINGS), a presentation of an analysis based on one report for
each phenomenon should be valid also. Further, the examination of data
relating to the actual number of phenomena was considered to be the proper
basis for assessing the probability of technological developments outside
the range of present-day scientific knowledge. Therefore, a designation of
OBJECT SIGHTINGS was established, with the following definition:

OBJECT SIGHTING – (1) The group of reports consisting of
one report for each phenomenon. (2) The
questionnaire, work sheet, and IBM card
representing a report for each phenomenon
accepted for the statistical study.

In brief review, ALL SIGHTINGS refer to all reports, UNIT SIGHTINGS
refer to actual sightings, and OBJECT SIGHTINGS refer to the assumed
number of phenomena.

It must be recognized that the process of identifying OBJECT
SIGHTINGS was deductive, while that for UNIT SIGHTINGS was definitive.
A conservative approach was adopted in the determination of OBJECT
SIGHTINGS, using the factors of date and time of observations, location
of observers, duration of observations, and range, bearing, track direction, and identification of the phenomena. Any error of selection of OBJECT
SIGHTINGS will tend to be in the direction of reducing the actual number of
phenomena observed (several instances of UNIT SIGHTINGS that might be
one OBJECT SIGHTING were noted, but the evidence was not conclusive
enough to justify consolidation of the reports).

Following the determination of OBJECT SIGHTINGS, a series of
serial numbers, called the INCIDENT SERIAL NUMBERS, was established
to facilitate any future study of a specific object sighting. Each reported
sighting that relates to an OBJECT SIGHTING received the same incident
serial number, a four-digit code paralleling the major serial number
series.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

For machine manipulation, it was desirable to be able to select the sample of cards (all reports, all sightings, or all phenomena) to be included in a particular study. The concept of a SIGHTING IDENTIFICATION NUMBER was evolved to fill this desire. Using one column of the IBM card, and the correlated working papers, the code for this function was developed. Multiple punching eliminated the need to use several columns for discrete expression of the variations. Selection of the proper number in this column thus permitted selection of the desired sample of cards.

Evaluation of Individual Reports

Evaluation of sighting reports was recognized as a crucial step in the preparation of data for statistical treatment; inconsistent evaluations would have invalidated any conclusions to be derived from this study. A method of evaluation was, therefore, determined simultaneously with the development of the questionnaire, the coding system, and the work sheet. It is emphasized that all phases of evaluation, even including the tedious preparation of the original data for statistical treatment, were entrusted only to selected, specially qualified scientists and engineers.

Evaluation consisted of a standardized procedure to be followed for: (1) the deduction of discrete facts from data which depended on human impressions rather than scientific measurements, (2) the rating of the observer and his report as determined from available information, and (3) the determination of the probable identification of the phenomenon observed. Categories of identification, established upon the basis of previous experience, were as follows:

Balloon
Astronomical
Aircraft
Light phenomenon
Birds
Clouds, dust, etc.
Insufficient information
Psychological manifestations
Unknown
Other

The first step in evaluation, the deduction of discrete facts from subjective data, required certain calculations based on the information available in the sighting report. An example was the finding of the approximate angular velocity and acceleration of the object or objects sighted. Care was taken during this phase of the work to insure against the deduction of discrete facts not warranted by the original data. Thus, even though there was a complete lack of any valid evidence consisting of

physical matter in any case of a reported unidentified aerial object, this
was not assumed to be prima facie evidence that "flying saucers" did not
exist.

In those cases in which an attempt to reduce the information to a
factual level failed completely, the report was eliminated from further consideration, and thus not included in the statistical analysis. About 800
reports of sightings were eliminated or rejected in this manner. Most of
these reports were rejected because they were extremely nebulous; the
rest were rejected because they contained highly conflicting statements.

The second step in evaluation, the rating of the observer and his
report, logically followed the first step, the reduction of the data to usable
form. Ratings were assigned on the basis of the following factors of information, considered in relation to one another:

(1) The experience of the observer, deduced from his
occupation, age, and training;

(2) The consistency among the separate portions of the
description of the sighting;

(3) The general quality and completeness of the report;

(4) Consideration of the observer's fact-reporting ability
and attitude, as disclosed by his manner of describing
the sighting.

In cases in which insufficient information was available to make a judgment
of the observer or report, none was made, but the report was accepted for
the statistical study.

The third step in the process of evaluation, the attempted identification of the object or objects sighted, was done twice, first by the individual
who made the transcription of the data (the preliminary identification), and
later (the final identification) by a conference of four persons, two representatives from ATIC and two from the panel of consultants. Although
representatives of ATIC participated in making the final identifications, it
must be emphasized that any previous identification of a sighting made by
ATIC was not introduced or referred to in any way.

In the coding system, the choices provided for final identifications
were based on ATIC's previous experience in analysis of the data. They
had found that the majority of sightings could be classified as misinterpretations of common objects or natural phenomena. Accordingly, categories
for objects most frequently present in the air were provided. Balloons,
aircraft, astronomical bodies (such as meteors), birds, and clouds or dust
were recognized as major categories. The less frequent, but common
objects, such as kites, fireworks, flares, rockets, contrails, and

Here is the text from the document:

meteorological phenomena like small tornadoes, were collected into a category called OTHER. A separate category for the uncommon natural phenomena associated with light reflections or refractions, such as mirages, sun dogs, inversion-layer images, and distortions caused by airborne ice, was established with the title of LIGHT PHENOMENON. Categories for INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION, PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS, and UNKNOWN were provided for the sightings that could not be fitted into the preceding identifications. An explanation of their use follows:

INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION - This identification category was assigned to a report when, upon final consideration, there was some essential item of information missing, or there was enough doubt about what data were available to disallow identification as a common object or some natural phenomenon. It is emphasized that this category of identification was not used as a convenient way to dispose of what might be called "poor unknowns", but as a category for reports that, perhaps, could have been one of several known objects or natural phenomena. No reports identified as INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION contain authenticated facts or impressions concerning the sighting that would prevent its being identified as a known or able phenomenon;

PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS - This identification category was assigned to a report when, although it was well established that the observer had seen something, it was also obvious that the description of the sighting had been overdrawn. Religious fanaticism, a desire for publicity, or an over-active imagination were the most common mental aberrations causing this type of report;

UNKNOWN - This designation in the identification code was assigned to those reports of sightings wherein the description of the object and its maneuvers could not be fitted to the pattern of any known object or phenomenon.

For the purposes of this study, two groups of identifications were recognized, the KNOWNS (including all identification categories except the UNKNOWN) and the UNKNOWNS.

All possible identifications provided in the code system, except INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION and UNKNOWN, could be assigned according to two degrees of certainty, designated "Certain" and "Doubtful".

Here is the OCR text from the document:

A "Certain" identification indicated a minimum amount of doubt regarding the validity of the evaluation. By "rule-of-thumb" reasoning, the probability of the identification being correct was better than 95 per cent. A "Doubtful" identification indicated that the choice was less positive, but that there was a better than even chance of being correct.

It is emphasized again that, as was true for other phases of evaluation, preliminary and final identification was entrusted only to scientists and engineers who, in addition to their broad scientific background, had received instruction, where necessary, in specialized subjects. The panel of consultants provided background information for this instruction. Many of the cases representing unusual features or maneuvers were submitted to and discussed with various members of the panel of consultants prior to the final identification.

Consistency in the application of the knowledge necessary for making identifications was maintained by frequent collaboration among the personnel involved, and systematic spot checks of the work. In addition to the general fund of knowledge required to identify satisfactorily a reported unidentified aerial object, an attempt was made to correlate specific data such as flight plans of aircraft, records of balloon releases, weather conditions, and an astronomical almanac with the reported sighting.

The procedure followed in making final identifications deserves explanation because of the importance assumed by the identification as a basis for statistical treatment. As was mentioned, a conference of four qualified persons, two from ATIC and two from the panel of consultants, decided upon the final identification for each sighting report. This work was done at ATIC, periodically, as reports became ready.

During an identification conference, each sighting report was first studied, from the original data, by one person. If that person arrived at a decision, it was checked against the preliminary identification; if the two identifications were the same, the report was appropriately marked and considered finished. If the two identifications did not agree, the report was considered later by everyone participating in the conference until a group decision could be made.

If an evaluator was unable to categorize the report as one of the common objects or as a natural phenomenon, and his opinion was that the sighting should be recorded as UNKNOWN, a group decision was also required on that report before it was considered finished. A group decision was necessary on all reports finally recorded as UNKNOWN, regardless of what the preliminary identification had been. In cases where a group decision was not made within a reasonable time, the report was put aside and later submitted to certain members of the panel of consultants for their opinions. If, after this, disagreement continued to exist, the report of the sighting was identified as UNKNOWN.

Upon completion of final identifications, all data were transferred to
IBM cards, preparatory to analysis.

ANALYSIS OF THE DATA

Broadly stated, the problem at this point consisted of the judicious
application of scientific methods of categorizing and analyzing the sub-
jective data in reports of sightings of unidentified aerial objects. It was
recognized that an approach to this problem could best be made by a sys-
tematic sorting and tabulation program to give frequency and percentage
distributions of the important characteristics of sightings. A suggestion
that an attempt be made to anticipate all questions that might be asked in
the future about a sighting or a group of sightings, and to provide answers,
was rejected. The systematic approach also made it possible to develop
a detailed reference manual of the attributes of the sightings included in
this study.

Thus, at the beginning of the analysis, a detailed plan was developed
for sorting, counting, and tabulating the information from the punched-card
abstracts of reports of sightings. It was believed at the time, and later
substantiated, that the results of the program for sorting and tabulating
would serve as a guide for the more sophisticated treatment involving
statistical methods.

Also, it was anticipated that any patterns or trends that might be
found could be subjected to concentrated study in the hope of discovering
significant information relating to the characteristics of "flying saucers".
Further, it was believed that these trends could serve as certain of the
criteria of validity for any concepts (models) developed in the attempt to
discover a class of "flying saucers".

The three parts of this study (1) the sorting and tabulation program,
(2) the advanced study of the results of that program, and (3) the investiga-
tion of the possibility of conceiving a model of a "flying saucer" from
descriptions reported, are discussed in sections entitled "Frequency and
Percentage Distributions by Characteristics", "Advanced Study of the Data",
and "The 'Flying Saucer' Model".

Frequency and Percentage Distributions by Characteristics

The original conception of this study assumed the availability of
sufficient data to describe adequately the physical appearance, maneuver
characteristics, range, direction, and probable path of the object or
objects observed. However, familiarity with the data, acquired during the

translation and transcription from reports to punched cards, indicated that
there would be relatively few specific variables or factors that would yield
meaningful correlation studies. Either the original data were too subjec-
tive, or the incompleteness of the original reports would seriously reduce
the sample of a specific variable.

Preliminary tabulations of various sortings substantiated the im-
possibility of deriving statistical results from certain variables, such as
movement of the observer during the sighting, sound, shape parameters,
size, angular velocity and acceleration, appearance and disappearance
bearing, initial and final elevation, altitude, and orientation of the object.
The statistically usable variables presented in this study include the date,
time, location, duration, reliability, and method of observation of the
sighting, and the physical attributes of number, color, speed, shape, light
brightness, and identification of the objects sighted.

The presentation of frequency and percentage distributions of any of
the variables must be interpreted in the light of the sample of incidents
represented. For example, the analysis of the reported colors of the
objects sighted, based on ALL SIGHTINGS, could lead to misrepresenta-
tion of the distribution of some of the color of the objects, because of the
multiplicity of reports on some of the phenomena. On the other hand, the
percentage distribution of the light brightness reported by each observer
is more likely to be correct than a distribution based on one report for
each phenomenon. To assure that the most nearly correct presentation
was made, and to avoid the possibility of failure to uncover any pattern or
trend inherent in the data, the variables were studied on five different
bases or samples. These samples, and their numerical relation to each
other, were as follows:

ALL SIGHTINGS (all reports)        - 3,201 cards
UNIT SIGHTINGS, all observers       - 2,554 cards
UNIT SIGHTINGS, single observer     - 2,232 cards
UNIT SIGHTINGS, multiple observers  - 322 cards
OBJECT SIGHTINGS                    - 2,199 cards

The preliminary tabulations indicated that the samples based on UNIT
SIGHTINGS, single observer, and UNIT SIGHTINGS, multiple observers,
would not add materially to this study. Accordingly, although the fre-
quency distributions were recorded and are available for study, they are
not presented in this report.

The bases of ALL SIGHTINGS, UNIT SIGHTINGS (referring to all
observers), and OBJECT SIGHTINGS are presented in Appendix A as
Tables A1 through A240. A critical study of these tabulations reveals that
there is no apparent change in the distribution of any variable from one
basis to another, and that no marked patterns or trends exist in any sample.

Graphical Presentation

Graphical representation of the important information contained in the tables is presented in Figures 1 through 38. These figures present the distributions of the important variables only by the total number of cases in each identification category, since no significant differences were found between the distributions of "Certain" and "Doubtful" identifications of objects with respect to the variables. A chronological study of these figures will afford a broad picture of the tabulated information, without the necessity of a detailed study of the tables.

A critical examination of the figures will show that no trends, patterns, or correlations are to be found, with the exception of Figures 18 through 30. The apparent similarity of the distributions shown by these mirror graphs, Figures 18 through 23, was tested by statistical methods which showed that there was a low probability that the distributions of the KNOWNS and UNKNOWNS by these characteristics were the same. These tests and their interpretation are discussed in the following section. For purposes of this study, the strategic areas, shown in Figures 32 through 38, and Tables A223 through A240, Appendix A, were designated on the basis of concentration of reports of OBJECT SIGHTINGS in an area. No other interpretation of the tables or remaining charts was deemed necessary.

Advanced Study of the Data

It was recognized that the lack of any patterns or trends, as shown by the tables and graphs, provided an insecure basis for drawing definite conclusions. Accordingly, shortly before the sorting and tabulation program was concluded, a program of study of the data was developed to utilize statistical and other mathematical methods, which could lead to a more concrete interpretation of the problem.

Position of the Sun Relative to the Observer

The first thing that was done was to calculate the angle of elevation of the sun above the horizon and its bearing from true north as seen by the observer at the time of each sighting. With this information, it could then be determined whether the reported object could have been illuminated by light from the sun. In addition, it could be determined whether there was a possibility of specular reflection from an aircraft at the position of the object, which would give the appearance of a "flying disc".

A program of computation was set up and carried out to obtain the angle of elevation and the bearing of the sun for each sighting. All information needed for this calculation was available on the deck of IBM cards.

CODES

CODE 1. GENERAL

a. These cards (and the corresponding WORK SHEETS) contain data from several sources. Columns referenced to the U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet (Form A) must have at least one entry. If no data are available for any column, the Y (or 12 punch) should be used.

b. Columns 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, and 51 are calculations from data appearing in the U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet (Form A). If the basic data for these calculations are not available, the appropriate columns are left blank.

c. If a number in any column is used to enter data, then X (or 11 punch) qualifies the data as indicated in the Code for the specific column.

EXAMPLE OF AN IBM CARD

313 and 314


- page 233 -

This appears to be an "Example of an IBM Card" (as noted on the right side of the document) from Project Blue Book. The document is a detailed data collection form with multiple columns including:

- Serial Number
- Observed Date/Time
- Latitude/Longitude
- Observation Details
- Angle of Elevation
- Duration of Observation
- Various other data fields

The form is designed to systematically record information about UFO sightings, with rows and columns for precise data entry. The document is printed in black and white and appears to be a standard form template used for documenting UFO observations during the 1950s.

The page is labeled "Exhibit BB" and the page numbers "315 and 316" are visible on the left side of the document.

Text found in the document:

FIGURE 7 FREQUENCY OF OBJECT SIGHTINGS AND UNKNOWN OBJECT EVALUATIONS BY MONTHS, 1947-1952

The page contains a graph showing the frequency of object sightings from 1947 to 1952, with two lines representing "All object sightings" and "Unknown object sightings". The vertical axis shows the number of sightings, and the horizontal axis shows the years from 1947 to 1952.

The page is numbered "23" on the left side.

At the bottom right of the image is a code "G-7488".

Here is the text from the document:

This information consisted of:
(1) Time and date of observation in Greenwich Civil Time
(2) Latitude and longitude of the observer at the time of observation.

Figure 39 shows a celestial sphere on which Z represents the observer's zenith, s represents the sun, and N represents the north celestial pole.

Using the date and time of the observation, the longitude and declination(S) of the sun were obtained from an ephemeris of the sun and corrected for the equation of time. The difference between the longitudes of the sun and the observer was taken, and called the hour angle (HA on Figure 39).

Then, using the declination of the sun (S), the latitude of the observer (lad), and the hour angle (HA), the angle (ZS) between the observer's zenith and the sun can be calculated from the law of cosines of spherical trigonometry. Thus, cos ZS = cos (90 - lat) cos (90 - S) + sin (90 - lat) sin (90 - S) cos (HA).

Since the angle ZS is measured from the observer's zenith, the angle of elevation of the sun above the horizon for daytime sightings was found by taking 90 - ZS. When the sun was below the horizon, the angle of depression of the sun below the horizon was found by taking ZS - 90.

Having found the angle ZS, the bearing of the sun (angle B) was obtained from the formula:

sin (B) / sin (90 - S) = sin (HA) / sin (ZS)

All of the above calculations were made with IBM equipment. Since, cosines, and their inverses were obtained from a deck of 9,000 IBM cards on which seven-place Peter's tables of the sines, cosines, and tangents of angles had been punched for each 0.01 of a degree from 0 to 90 degrees.

Upon completion of these calculations, the cards representing OBJECT SIGHTINGS were sorted on the sign of the sine of the bearing angle. This separated the cards into two groups: (1) sightings which occurred between noon and midnight, for which the sine of the bearing angle was positive; and (2) sightings between midnight and noon, for which the sine of the bearing angle was negative. Then each of these groups was sorted into groups for intervals of 10° in angle of elevation of the sun from -90° to +90°. A count was made of the number of cards in each group and from this a histogram was constructed (Figure 40). The UNKNOWN OBJECT SIGHTINGS were then sorted out, counted in the same manner, and a histogram was made (again see Figure 40).

(The image shows a graph with the x-axis representing the "Angle of Elevation of The Sun" from -90 to +90 degrees, and the y-axis showing the "Number of Object Sightings" up to 300. The graph includes two lines - one for "All object sightings" and another for "Unknown object sightings", with vertical lines marking sunrise and sunset.)


- page 272 -

Here is the text from the document:

The following points should be carefully noted about these histograms:

(1) The negligible number of sightings when the sun is within 10° of the zenith and nadir (angle of elevation of the sun = ±90°) of the observer is due to the fact that the southern-most latitude of the U. S. is greater than the declination of the sun at the summer solstice, so that it would be impossible for the sun to reach the zenith or nadir of any observer in the U. S. (where most of the sightings were made).

(2) The time of day at which a particular angle of elevation of the sun does not remain fixed but varies from day to day. Consider, for example, the variation in sunrise and sunset times over the course of a year.

Thus, there are only two inferences to be made from this histogram:
(1) the high peak of sightings soon after sunset, and (2) the lack of increase in the UNKNOWNS relative to the KNOWNS near either sunset or sunrise. This would seem to discount the possibility that atmospheric phenomena such as mock suns were the primary cause of the unknown reports, since such phenomena usually occur when the sun is near the horizon.

The Local Sun Time was computed as a step in the calculation of the angle of elevation of the sun. It is related to the hour angle by the equation:
Local Sun Time (L.S.T.) = HA/15 + 12.00, where L.S.T. is in hours and HA in degrees.

The cards were grouped on the basis of L.S.T. in intervals of one hour, and the number of cards in each interval was counted. Again the UNKNOWNS were sorted out and similarly treated. Histograms were constructed with the results of these tabulations of OBJECT SIGHTINGS (Figure 41). Here, again, there is a peak in the early evening hours.

The cards were then broken up into seven groups on the basis of the angle of elevation of the sun, as follows:

Group 1 – Daylight sightings for which the sun was more than 10° above the horizon.

Group 2 – Sunset sightings for which the sun was between 0° and 10° above the horizon.

Group 3 – Sunset sightings for which the sun was between 0° and 10° below the horizon.

Group 4 – Evening sightings for which the sun was between 10° and 40° below the horizon.

These group numbers were punched on the cards and incorporated into the coding system. The number of OBJECT SIGHTINGS in each group for each identification was then tabulated and is given in Table I.

According to this table, a large majority of the KNOWN OBJECT SIGHTINGS in Group 1 (343 out of 467) were aircraft. In Groups 4 and 5 combined, a large majority (681 out of 899) were either balloons, aircraft, or astronomical. Accordingly, a re-evaluation of the UNKNOWNS in these three groups was planned with the objective of determining which of the UNKNOWNS in Group 1 might possibly be aircraft or balloons and which of the UNKNOWNS in Groups 4 and 5 might possibly be balloons, aircraft, or astronomical objects. More will be said of this project later.

Statistical Chi Square Test

In the meantime, mirror graphs had been constructed from the frequency tabulations which seemed to show that, when the KNOWNS (total less UNKNOWNS) and the UNKNOWNS were grouped according to one of six characteristics, the percentage of KNOWNS and the percentage of

[Page number] 60


- page 275 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

UNKNOWNS in each characteristic group showed the same general trend. In other words, on the basis of these graphs, it looked as though there was a good possibility that the UNKNOWNS were no different from the KNOWNS, at least in the aggregate. It was decided to investigate this by the use of a statistical procedure called the "Chi Square Test".

The Chi Square Test is a statistical test of the likelihood that two distributions come from the same population, that is, it gives the probability that there is no difference in the make-up of the two distributions being measured.

The method is outlined as follows:

(1) Adjust the distributions by multiplying the KNOWNS in each characteristic group by the ratio of the total number of UNKNOWNS to the total number of KNOWNS. (The Chi Square Test is applicable only to distributions which have the same total number of elements.)

(2) Take the difference between the number of UNKNOWNS and the adjusted number of KNOWNS in each characteristic group.

(3) Square the remainder from Step 2.

(4) Divide the result of Step 3 by the corresponding number of adjusted KNOWNS.

This is the chi square for the particular group. Summing the individual chi squares over the groups of a characteristic gives the chi square for that characteristic. This number is then compared with a table of the distribution of chi square which can be found in many texts on elementary statistics.

It will be noted that chi square is tabulated in terms of degrees of freedom which in this case is one less than the number of groups of sightings for each characteristic.

The tabulations of KNOWNS and UNKNOWNS against the six characteristics and the Chi Square Test as it was applied are shown in Tables II through VII. In each case, the number of degrees of freedom is given, as is the value of chi square corresponding to this probability of 5 per cent and 1 per cent that two distributions with this number of degrees of freedom come from the same population. Since the greater the value of chi square the smaller the probability of homogeneity of two distributions, a calculated value of chi square greater than either the 5 per cent or 1 per cent values will indicate a probability less than 5 per cent or 1 per cent, respectively, that the two distributions are homogeneous. The term homogeneity is used here to indicate that two distributions could have come from the same population.

SUMMARY

Reports of unidentified aerial objects (popularly termed "flying saucers" or "flying discs") have been received by the U. S. Air Force since mid-1947 from many and diverse sources. Although there was no evidence that the unexplained reports of unidentified objects constituted a threat to the security of the U. S., the Air Force determined that all reports of unidentified aerial objects should be investigated and evaluated to determine if "flying saucers" represented technological developments not known to this country.

In order to discover any pertinent trends or patterns inherent in the data, and to evaluate or explain any trends or patterns found, appropriate methods of reducing these data from reports of unidentified aerial objects to a form amenable to scientific appraisal were employed. In general, the original data upon which this study was based consisted of impressions and interpretations of apparently unexplainable events, and seldom contained reliable measurements of physical attributes. This subjectivity of the data presented a major limitation to the drawing of significant conclusions, but did not invalidate the application of scientific methods of study.

The reports received by the U. S. Air Force on unidentified aerial objects were reduced to IBM punched-card abstracts of the data by means of logically developed forms and standardized evaluation procedures. Evaluation of sighting reports, a crucial step in the preparation of the data for statistical treatment, consisted of an appraisal of the reports and the subsequent categorizing of the object or objects described in each report. A detailed description of this phase of the study stresses the careful attempt to maintain complete objectivity and consistency.

Analysis of the refined and evaluated data derived from the original reports of sightings comprised (1) a systematic attempt to ferret out any distinguishing characteristics inherent in the data or any of their segments, (2) a concentrated study of any trends or patterns found, and (3) an attempt to determine the probability that any of the UNKNOWNS represent observations of a class, or classes, of "flying saucers".

The first step in the analysis of the data revealed the existence of certain apparent similarities between cases of objects definitely identified and those not identified. Statistical methods of testing were applied which indicated a low probability that these apparent similarities were significant. An attempt to determine the probability that any of the UNKNOWNS represent observations of a class, or classes, of "flying saucers" necessitated a thorough re-examination and re-evaluation of cases of objects not originally identified; this led to the conclusion that the probability was very small.

Here is the text from the document:

In five of the six cases, the probability is less than 1 per cent that the distributions are the same. In the sixth case, Light Brightness, the classifications are too nebulous to be of real value. However, these tests do not necessarily mean that the UNKNOWNS are primarily "flying saucers" and not aircraft, balloons, or other known objects or natural phenomena.

The UNKNOWNS might still be unidentified KNOWNS if either of the following cases occurred:

(1) The characteristics which were observed for the UNKNOWNS were different from those observed for the KNOWNS because of the psychological make-up of the observer or because of atmospheric distortion. This assumes the distribution of objects in KNOWNS and UNKNOWNS is the same.

(2) The UNKNOWNS may be known objects in different proportions than the group identified as KNOWNS. (That is, a greater percentage of the UNKNOWNS could be aircraft than the percentage of aircraft in the identified KNOWNS.)

The second case is the more probable one. In this connection, it is interesting to note the factors which contributed to a large chi square result in the tests made above:

(1) Color

The major contribution to chi square in color is from the color green. There is a large excess of green sightings among the KNOWNS over the UNKNOWNS. Of the 130 known objects in this classification, 98 are astronomical, and are due mostly to the green fireballs reported from the Southwest U. S.

(2) Number

The large chi square is due to a greater proportion of UNKNOWNS in the multiple object classification. Apparently these are harder to identify.

(3) Shape

In this case, there is a higher percentage of UNKNOWNS in the rocket-aircraft-shape classification. These might be familiar objects for which unusual maneuvers were reported.

There is a higher percentage of KNOWNS in the flame and in the meteor- or comet-shape category, which in both cases appears to result mainly from excesses of astronomical sightings.

68


- page 284 -

Here is the text from the document:

(4) Duration of observation

Here there is an excess of KNOWNS in the less-than-5-second group. Again, the majority of KNOWNS in this group are astronomical. The greater proportion of UNKNOWNS in the 31- to 60-second and 61-second to 5-minute groups cannot be explained.

(5) Speed

The major contribution to chi square for this characteristic is due to a large excess of UNKNOWNS in the over 400-mph class. It can be assumed that some of the excessive speeds are inaccuracies in estimates by observers. However, some radar sightings, which are practically impossible to identify, show objects with speeds of 1,000 to 2,000 mph and these reports account for a number of these UNKNOWNS.

(6) Light brightness

Since this chi square was not significant, it is not necessary to discuss it here.

An examination of these discrepancies thus brings up a very interesting point. In every case for which the chi square excess of KNOWNS over UNKNOWNS, the excess can be attributed to an excess of identifiable astronomical phenomena. This would seem to lead to the conclusion that astronomical phenomena are easy to identify and there are very few left in the UNKNOWNS. Accordingly, the astronomical object sightings were deleted from the KNOWN object sightings and the Chi Square Test was again applied. The results are shown in Tables VIII through XIII, where in this case the KNOWNS do not contain astronomical sightings.

It will be noted that some groups were combined when the adjusted number of KNOWNS was ten or less, except for the case for which the number of objects per sighting was the characteristic studied. These were borderline cases, and no good combination of groups existed.

It is apparent that the deletion of astronomical sightings gives a better fit, although the decision is not clear cut, since for two cases (light brightness and speed), the chi square increased. However, it can again be pointed out that the reporting of these two characteristics is highly subjective and is open to question. The estimation of speed is especially open to question because of the impossibility of accurately determining it visually.

Therefore, on the basis of this evaluation of the information, it is considered to be highly improbable that reports of unidentified aerial objects examined in this study represent observations of technological developments outside of the range of present-day scientific knowledge. It is emphasized that there was a complete lack of any valid evidence consisting of physical matter in any case of a reported unidentified aerial object.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Another interesting aspect of these new tests is that there are only two large discrepancies in all of the groups. These are for the 11 or more groups in the classification by number of objects per sighting and for the over-400-mph and meteor-like group for the classification by speed. The first was relatively unchanged by deletion of the astronomical sightings principally because of the concentration of sightings in the single-object category. The second was slightly increased by the removal of the astronomical sightings from the meteor-like classification. However, the main discrepancy, that of the excess of UNKNOWNS in the over-400-mph class, was little changed.

The results of these tests are inconclusive since they neither confirm nor deny that the UNKNOWNS are primarily unidentified KNOWNS, although they do indicate that relatively few of the UNKNOWNS are actually astronomical phenomena.

It was decided that this process would not be carried to its logical conclusion (that is, the determination of a linear combination of KNOWNS that would give a negligible chi square when compared with the UNKNOWNS), since it was felt that the inaccuracies in the reports would give a distorted and meaningless result.

The "Flying Saucer" Model

The importance of the problem dictated a second approach, should the statistical results prove inconclusive. It was decided that an attempt would be made to describe the physical appearance, flight characteristics, and other attributes (that is, construct a model) of a class or classes of "flying saucers".

Preparatory to this attempt, a re-evaluation of the UNKNOWNS was necessary. This re-evaluation was accomplished by a panel composed only of persons previously associated with the work. Using all the UNKNOWNS reports available at ATIC, the panel made a careful study of the reports for the UNKNOWN SIGHTINGS in angle-of-sun-elevation Groups 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 - those groups for which the sun was either above the horizon or less than 10° in elevation below the horizon.

This study had two purposes. The first was to determine, with additional information such as the angle of elevation of the sun, how many of the UNKNOWNS might be ascribed to known phenomena. The second was to obtain those UNKNOWNS which were described in sufficient detail that they might be used to construct a model or models of "flying saucers".

It was decided to put any of the UNKNOWNS which might be known phenomena into a "possible KNOWN" category to denote the slightly lower confidence level which could be ascribed to these new evaluations. The

76


- page 293 -

UNKNOWNS with sufficiently detailed description would be called "good UNKNOWNS", while the remainder would simply be called UNKNOWNS.

One hundred sixty-four folders of a total of 186 OBJECT SIGHTINGS in Groups 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 were examined. There were 18 possible aircraft, 20 possible balloons, 7 good UNKNOWNS, 100 UNKNOWNS, and 19 others which were identified as being possible KNOWNS of various types. It is interesting to note that two of these were established as mock suns on the basis of the angle of sun elevation and the sun bearing angle, together with the direction of the object from the observer. In addition, the UNKNOWNS in angle-of-sun-elevation Groups 4 and 5 (nighttime sightings) were scanned with no attempt at identification, but to find any possible "good UNKNOWNS".

There were five sightings that could be put into this category.

Of the UNKNOWNS, there were approximately 20 sightings that were observed in such a way that they should have been recognized easily if they had been familiar objects, that is, there was little possibility that their shapes, as seen, could have been distorted sufficiently by one cause or another to render them unrecognizable. There were a very few that would have been identified as guided missiles or rockets, but that were not so identified because of the geographical location in which they were seen.

All of the remaining UNKNOWNS were classified as such solely because they were reported to have performed maneuvers that could not be ascribed to any known objects. In these cases, the shape might have been unrecognizable also, but it was felt that this was because of distortion and distance, or because of darkness.

This is a very important point. To put it differently, if these UNKNOWNS, which represent all but about 40 of the UNKNOWN SIGHTINGS, were reported to have performed maneuvers which could be ascribed to known phenomena, they would probably have been identified as KNOWNS. With the exception of some radar sightings, all of these maneuvers were observed visually. The possibilities for inaccuracies are great because of the inability of an observer to estimate visually size, distance, and speed.

Reports of sightings by radar usually were of high-speed objects, some at extremely high altitudes. Some were identified as UNKNOWNS because there was no object to be seen visually at the point indicated by the radar set. It cannot be said with any assurance what these radar sightings mean, but the most logical explanation is that they are ground targets reflected by an atmospheric temperature inversion layer. The validity of this statement cannot be established. It is felt that radar sightings in this study are of no significance whatsoever unless a visual sighting of the object also is made.

Taken in conjunction with the Chi Square Tests discussed earlier, the results of the re-evaluation of reports identified as UNKNOWN SIGHTINGS would seem to indicate that the majority of them could easily

have been familiar objects. However, the resolution of this question with
any degree of certainty appears to be impossible.

Thus, out of the 434 OBJECT SIGHTINGS that were identified as
UNKNOWNS by the data reduction process, there were only 12 that were
described with sufficient detail that they could be used in an attempt to
derive a model of a "flying saucer". The following is a summary of the 12
good UNKNOWN SIGHTINGS:

Case I (Serial 0573.00)

Two men employed by a rug-cleaning firm were driving across a
bridge at 0955 hours on July 29, 1948, when they saw an object glide across
the road a few hundred feet in front of them. It was shiny and metallic in
construction, about 6 to 8 feet long and 2 feet wide. It was in a flat glide
path at an altitude of about 30 feet and in a moderate turn to the left. It was
seen for only a few seconds and apparently went down in a wooded area,
although no trace of it was found.

Case II (Serial 4508.00)

A naval aviation student, his wife, and several others were at a
drive-in movie from 115 to 2240 hours on April 20, 1952, during which
time they saw several groups of objects fly over. There were from two to
nine objects in a group and there were about 20 groups. The groups of

objects flew in a straight line except for some changes in direction accomplished in a manner like any standard aircraft turn.

The objects were shaped like conventional aircraft. The unaccountable feature of the objects was that each had a red glow surrounding it and was glowing itself, although it was a cloudless night.

Case III (Serial 2013.00, 2014.00, and 2014.01)

Two tower operators sighted a light over a city airport at 2020 hours on January 20, 1951. Since a commercial plane was taking off at this time, the pilots were asked to investigate this light. They observed it at 2026 hours. According to them, it flew abreast of them at a greater radius as they made their climbing turn, during which time it blinked some lights which looked like running lights. While the observing plane was still in its climbing turn, the object made a turn toward the plane and flew across its nose. As the two men turned their heads to watch it, it instantly appeared on their other side flying in the same direction as they were flying, and then in 2 or 3 seconds it slipped under them, and they did not see it again. Total time of the observation was not stated. In appearance, it was like an airplane with a cigar-shaped body and straight wings, somewhat larger than a B-29. No engine nacelles were observed on the wings.

Case IV (Serial 4599.00)

A part-time farmer and a hired hand were curing tobacco at midnight on July 19, 1952, when they looked up and saw two cigar-shaped objects. One hovered while the other moved to the east and came back, at which time both ascended until out of sight. Duration of observation was 3 to 4 minutes. Both had an exhaust at one end, and neither had projections of any kind. It was stated that they appeared to be transparent and illuminated from the inside.

Case V (Serial 0565.00 to 0565.03)

A pilot and copilot were flying a DC-3 at 0340 hours on July 24, 1948, when they saw an object coming toward them. It passed to the right and slightly above them, at which time it went into a step climb and was lost from sight in some clouds. Duration of the observation was about 10 seconds. One passenger was able to catch a flash of light as the object passed. The object seemed powered by rocket or jet motors shooting a trail of fire some 50 feet to the rear of the object. The object had no wings or other protrusion and had two rows of lighted windows.

INTRODUCTION

In June, 1947, Kenneth Arnold, a Boise, Idaho, businessman and private pilot, publicly reported the now-famous sighting of a chainlike formation of disc-shaped objects near Mount Rainier, Washington. Resulting newspaper publicity of this incident caught the public interest, and, shortly thereafter, a rash of reports of unidentified aerial objects spawned the term "flying saucers". During the years since 1947, many reports of unidentified aerial objects have been received by the Air Force from many and diverse sources.

The unfortunate term "flying saucer", or "flying disc", because of its widespread and indiscriminate use, requires definition. Many definitions have been offered, one of the best being that originated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the Emerson McMillin Observatory of The Ohio State University, who has taken a scientific interest in the problem of unidentified aerial objects since 1949. Dr. Hynek's definition of the term is "any aerial phenomenon or sighting that remains unexplained to the viewer at least long enough for him to write a report about it"(1). Dr. Hynek, elaborating on his definition, says, "Each flying saucer, so defined, has associated with it a probable field of public inspection like a electron in a field of ions, until 'captured' by an explanation which puts an end to its existence as a 'flying saucer'"(1).

This definition would be applicable to any and all of the sightings which remained unidentified throughout this study. However, the term "flying saucers" shall be used hereafter in this report to mean a novel, airborne phenomenon, a manifestation that is not part of or readily explainable by the fund of scientific knowledge known to be possessed by the Free World. This would include such items as natural phenomena that are not yet completely understood, psychological phenomena, or intruder aircraft of a type that may be possessed by some source in large enough numbers so that more than one independent mission may have been flown and reported. Thus, these phenomena are of the type which should have been observed and reported more than once.

Since 1947, public interest in the subject of unidentified aerial objects fluctuated more or less within reasonable limits until the summer of 1952, when the frequency of sightings reached a peak, possibly stimulated by several articles on the subject in leading popular magazines.

Early in 1952, the Air Force's cumulative study and analysis of reported sightings indicated that the majority of reports could be accounted for as misinterpretations of known objects (such as meteors, balloons, or aircraft), a few as the result of mild hysteria, and a very few as the result of unfamiliar meteorological phenomena and light aberrations. However,

Case VI (Serial 4822.00)

An instrument technician, while driving from a large city toward an Air Force base on December 22, 1952, saw an object from his car at 1930 hours. He stopped his car to watch it. It suddenly moved up toward the zenith in spurts from right to left at an angle of about 45°. It then moved off in level flight at a high rate of speed, during which maneuver it appeared white most of the time, but apparently rolled three times showing a red side. About halfway through its roll it showed no light at all. It finally assumed a position to the south of the planet Jupiter at a high altitude, at which position it darted back and forth, left and right alternately. Total time of the observation was 15 minutes. Apparently, the observer just stopped watching the object.

Case VII (Serial 2728.00)

A Flight Sergeant saw an object over an Air Force base in Korea at 0842 hours on June 6, 1952. The object flew in a series of spinning and tumbling actions. It was on an erratic course, first flying level, then stopping momentarily, shooting straight up, flying level and again tumbling, then changing course and disappearing into the sun. It reappeared and was seen flying back and forth across the sun. At one time an F-86 passed between the observer and the object. He pointed it out to another man who saw it as it manoeuvred near the sun.

An electrician was standing by the bathroom window of his home, facing west, at 0825 hours on July 31, 1948, when he first sighted an object. He ran to his kitchen where he pointed out the object to his wife. Total time sight was approximately 10 seconds, during which the object flew on a straight and level course from horizon to horizon, west to east.

Case IX (Serial 0066.00)

A farmer and his two sons, aged 8 and 10, were at his fishing camp on August 13, 1947. At about 1300 hours, he went to look for the boys, having sent them to the river for some tape from his boat. He noticed an object some 300 feet away, 75 feet above the ground. He saw it against the background of the canyon wall which was 400 feet high at this point. It was hedge hopping, following the contour of the ground, was sky blue, about 20 feet in diameter and 10 feet thick, and had pods on the side from which flames were shooting out. It made a swishing sound. The observer stated that the trees were highly agitated by the craft as it passed over. His two sons also observed the object. No one saw the object for more than a few seconds.

Case X (Serial 1119.00)

An employee in the supersonic laboratory of an aeronautical laboratory and some other employees of this lab, were by a river, 2-1/2 miles from its mouth, when they saw an object. The time was about 1700 hours on May 24, 1949. The object was reflecting sunlight when observed by naked eye. However, he then looked at it with 8-power binoculars, at which time there was no glare. (Did glasses have filter?) It was of metallic construction and was seen with good enough resolution to show that the skin was dirty. It moved off in horizontal flight at a gradually increasing rate of speed, until it seemed to approach the speed of a jet before it disappeared. No propulsion was apparent. Time of observation was 2-1/2 to 3 minutes.

[The document also contains two detailed illustrations of the UFO, one from the top view and one from an angled side view, with annotations describing the object's surface texture, color, and direction of motion.]

Case XI (Serial 1550.00)

On March 20, 1950, a Reserve Air Force Captain and an airlines Captain were flying a commercial airlines flight. At 21:26, the airline Captain directed the attention of the Reserve Air Force Captain to an object which apparently was flying at high speed, approaching the airliner from the south on a north heading. The Reserve Air Force Captain focused his attention on the object. Both crew members watched it as it passed in front of them and went out of sight to the right. The observation, which lasted about 25 to 35 seconds, occurred about 15 miles north of a medium-sized city. When the object passed in front of the airliner, it was not more than 1/2 mile distant and at an altitude of about 1000 feet higher than the airliner.

The object appeared to be circular, with a diameter of approximately 100 feet and with a vertical height considerably less than the diameter, giving the object a disc-like shape. In the top center was a light which was blinking at an estimated 3 flashes per second. This light was so brilliant that it would have been impossible to look at it continuously had not been blinking. This light could be seen only when the object was approaching and after it had passed the airliner. When the object passed in front of the observers, the bottom side was visible. The bottom side appeared to have 9 to 12 symmetrical oval or circular porthole-like locations in a circle approximately 3/4 of the distance from the center to the outer edge. Through these portholes came a soft purple light about the shade of aircraft fluorescent lights. The object was traveling in a straight line without spinning. Considering the visibility, the length of time the object was in sight, and the distance from the object, the Reserve Air Force Captain estimates the speed to be in excess of 1000 mph.

These 12 sightings can be classed into four categories on the basis of their shapes, as follows:

(1) Propeller shape - Case I
(2) Aircraft shape - Cases II and III
(3) Cigar shape - Cases IV and V
(4) Elliptical or disc shape - Cases VI to XII

The criterion for choosing the above sightings was that their descriptions were given in enough detail to permit diagrams of the objects to be drawn. It might be noted here that in all but one of these cases (Case XII) the observer had already drawn a diagram of what he had seen.

The objective of this section of the study was the conceiving of a model, or models. The requirement that the description be detailed is an important one, and was the easiest to determine in the re-evaluation program. However, a good model ought to satisfy the following conditions as well:

(1) The general shape of the object and the maneuvers it performed should fit the reports of many of the UNKNOWNS and thus explain them.

(2) The observer and the report should be reliable.

(3) The report should contain elements which should have been observed with accuracy, and which eliminate the possibility that the sighting could be ascribed to a familiar object or to a known natural phenomenon.

(4) The model should be derived from two or more good UNKNOWNS between which there is no essential conflict.

It can be shown that it is not possible to deduce a model from the 12 cases that will satisfy all of these conditions. The following case-by-case discussion of the 12 good UNKNOWNS will illustrate this point:

(1) Case I does not satisfy Conditions 1 and 4. The reported shape of this object is not duplicated in any of the other UNKNOWNS.

(2) Case II does not satisfy Conditions 1 and 3. There are very few UNKNOWNS in the aircraft shape classification. In addition, the unusual characteristic of this sighting (i.e., the red glow) could have been reflection of the lights of Flint from the objects if they were either birds or aircraft.
