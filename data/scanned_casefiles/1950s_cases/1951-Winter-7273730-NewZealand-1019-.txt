REPORT NO. 7273730 OF 24 JANUARY 1951

On the evening of 14 December, 1950, the observer, Mr. [redacted], a member of the staff at the [redacted] Observatory, Te Awamutu, was driving a car near Waitomo, New Zealand, when he and his companion saw an unusual luminous phenomenon in the sky.

Mr. [redacted] states that at about 8.30 p.m. on the evening of 14 December, he and his companion were travelling home from Te Awamutu to their home in Hamilton, New Zealand, and when they were about 10 miles north-west of Te Awamutu they saw a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving rapidly southwards. At first it appeared to be a star, but it soon became obvious that it was a self-luminous object of considerable size.

The object was visible for approximately one minute and during this time appeared to change direction and altitude. When first seen it was at an altitude of about 30 degrees above the horizon and when it disappeared from view it was at an angle of about 15 degrees above the horizon.

The image shows a black and white photograph depicting a rural landscape. In the foreground, there is a small structure, possibly a shed or outbuilding. In the background, there is a wooded area with tall pine trees. In the sky, there appears to be a strange, disc-shaped object that could be interpreted as a UFO.
