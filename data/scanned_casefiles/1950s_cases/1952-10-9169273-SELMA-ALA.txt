SUBJECT                                  FROM    Headquarters, 3615th Pilot Training
                                                 Wing, Craig AFB, Alabama
LOCATION    SELMA, ALABAMA        DATE OF INCIDENT    29 October 1952    DATE OF INFORMATION    20 October 1952

PREPARED BY    JAMES R. MCKEE, Maj., USAF

At approximately 1700 hours on 19 October 1952, an object appeared in the sky west of SELMA, ALABAMA, that caused considerable comment among some of the people who saw it. According to the report, it was a circular or fan-shaped object similar to an airplane and an object that detached itself from this trail in much the same way that an airplane would detach a trail of smoke. The people who saw it were quite certain of the conditions that caused it. The trail was remarkable for its short length and both parts for its brilliance.

This phenomenon was visible from 1700 hours until about 1755. Its altitude was estimated at 35,000 to 45,000 feet and no sound was heard. Ceiling and visibility were unlimited, and the weather was a few scattered clouds. People saw either one or both objects and all but one of them attributed their brilliance to reflections from the trail. The short length of the trail, which varied from very short and fan-shaped to ten or fifteen times the width, depending on the position of the observer, was generally believed to be caused by an airplane traveling either directly toward or away from the general area.

Lt. McKee considered the object he saw unusual because of its brilliance, the length of time it retained its brilliance and the manner of its disappearance. He saw it for thirty or forty seconds. He did not believe the trail at that altitude was a proper attitude to the sun, set as a reflecting surface for that period of time. This tendency with the fact that it seemed to hang in the sky made him believe that it generated its own brilliance. He said its speed was not excessive.

Flight Service reported high-speed aircraft operating in this area at this time. Two personnel at Craig AFB reported that a high-speed aircraft was operating in the base at about 1725 hours. It is believed that this incident can be explained as an aircraft of a high speed, high altitude type, making an angular relationship to the sun and the observer.

STATEMENT

The following statement is submitted as required by AF Letter 200-5, dated 29 April 1952:

On Sunday afternoon, October 19, 1952 at about .1755 hours I was reading the newspaper in my home when a neighbor called to me and said something. Then I went into the yard to pointed to an object in the sky that looked light and brilliant. After a brief stare, I saw, perhaps, brilliance and color to resemble the evening star. It traveled at a high speed, left no trail and made no sound that I could hear. Then I first saw it, it was about 20 degrees south of the sun, at a high altitude and was traveling on what appeared to be a straight course toward the southeast. After about thirty or forty seconds the brilliance changed gradually to a dull red. Then which vanished, then disappeared.

I saw this object with the unaided eye at my home in Selmont, which is located approximately one mile south of Selma, Alabama. The unusual features about this observation were the initial brilliance, the length of time this brilliance lasted, and the odd manner in which it changed color and then disappeared.

STATEMENT

The following statement is submitted as required by AF Letter 200-5 dated 29 April 1952.

At 1745 hours on 19 October 1952, I was standing on the steps of the Guard House when I noticed a small vapor trail a short distance behind the object. The vapor trail was about two to three feet in length. I watched this object for some minutes. A small object was located to be at about 50 degrees.

By belief is that this object was some type of aircraft leaving a vapor trail as there was an aircraft in the area. I noted the vapor trail which looked like an airplane traveling at a very high altitude, and the vapor trail and the object were moving very very slowly.
