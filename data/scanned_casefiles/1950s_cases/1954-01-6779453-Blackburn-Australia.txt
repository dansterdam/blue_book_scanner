                    SIGHTING OF UNUSUAL AERIAL OBJECT
                    BLACKBURN - 3rd January 1954

1. Herewith report of a sighting by Mr [redacted] of Blackburn of an usual aerial
object 1855 hours 3rd January 1954.

2. Four other observers have reported to Department of Civil Aviation sighting
similar objects at about the same time on 3rd January 1954 but it has not been possible
to correlate these sightings as yet.

3. Mr [redacted] report was made to the Air Operations Room APRO only immediately after
the sightings. The writer visited Mr [redacted] at his home on 5th January 1954 and
obtained the attached report. Mr [redacted] who was beside her husband at the time of
sighting, saw nothing. Mr [redacted] appeared quite genuine and had no previous interest
in "flying saucers" or other aerial phenomena. In fact he objected to the term
"flying saucer" as applied to his sighting and regrets having mentioned his sighting
because of subsequent ridicule from his neighbours.
