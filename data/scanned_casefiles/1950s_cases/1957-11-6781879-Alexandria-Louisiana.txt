The description, flight path and duration is typical of a meteor.

The image does not contain any photograph, but rather a detailed star chart showing the position and names of various celestial objects and constellations. The title of the image is "Venus Most Prominent", indicating that it is focused on the position and visibility of the planet Venus in the night sky.

ASTRONOMY
Venus Most Prominent
Venus is the brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars." Then you will see them high in the south by early evening. Venus now stares over in the west, after the sun sets, with a brilliant figure stands against, and to the left of her, the well-known figure stands Aquarius, the water-bearer. Looking closely, one can see that aside of Venus, in the evening, two other planets appear in the sky, bright near Venus. One is Saturn, and the other is Jupiter. However, it is Venus that exceeds the star in brilliance at this time. Venus appears much brighter than anything else in the sky at present, rivaling the brightness of the moon. In the evening, look for Venus, the brightest object in sight. This will continue through the month of November.

Shower or "Shooters" to Come
November is the month bringing one of the year's famous showers of "shooting stars," which appear from about this time to the 18th.

No Case (Information Only)
7 November 1957
Meridian, Mississippi

The following morning, November 7th, a truck driver named Melvin Stevens said he encountered an egg-shaped object on the highway near Ridgeland, Mississippi. From it emerged three "queer-looking people" with "pasty-white faces and dark hair." They "hesitated" unintelligibly, and then with "pasty-white hands," a companion corroborated his story.

The image contains a newspaper article with the title "RECORD ASCENT "Lovely Up There," 2 Balloonists Say". The article discusses the record-breaking high-altitude flight of two balloonists, Central Lewis (D.) and Rose, who claimed to have reached an altitude of over 76,000 feet, much higher than they had anticipated. The article includes details about their ascent and descent, as well as photographs showing the balloons during the flight.

RECORD ASCENT 
"Lovely Up There," 2 Balloonists Say
RAPID CITY, S. D., Nov. 5. - (UP) - With a record ascension of more than 14 miles to their credit, two balloonists rested today after their daring trip - and told their story to earth. 
Central Lewis (D.) and Rose, of South Dakota and Nebraska, said they had reached 76,000 feet - faster than they had anticipated.
"Lovely up there," they said, "we think we will stay with the balloon as long as we can." 
They related how, from an altitude of 75,000 feet, they saw "the whole world black and the horizon sharply defined." They reported seeing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and Lake Superior.
The remarkable ascent occurred on Aug. 16, but the story of their venture was not made public until today. Their balloon went up from Rapid City, S. D., and they descended two hours and 20 minutes later near Cody, Wyoming.
However, Capt. Ivan G. Kincheloe, Jr., a U. S. Air Force test pilot, said the previous flight was an unofficial record set last August at Edwards Air Force Base, Cal.
UP AT 75,000 FEET, the two men said, "It was dark as night." They reported their oxygen equipment worked perfectly and the temperature remained comfortable.
They said they did not realize their altitude at first, indicating an instrument which should have shown their height up to 50,000 feet was showing only 45,000 feet. It was after checking other instruments that they learned they had soared higher than their instruments could fully record. 
Then they started descending, getting down to 45,000 feet in just 20 minutes - faster than they had anticipated. 
"Something happened - we don't know what," they said, "and then we started descending again and our rate of descent increased." 
Rose and Lewis said they didn't know what - and their fall rates of 4,000 feet a minute that caused them to hit the ground with a tremendous impact. However, they said, "it was nothing we couldn't handle."

Lt Comdr. Morton L. Lewis finds all the comforts of his home in the gondola, let it be in which he ends in Washington, D.C. will try a Balloon flight. At right is Harold Kpeech, Minneapolis, project director for General Mills, responsible for the naval research. Comdr. Ross, right, and Comdr. Lewis try out the attitude-control pressue suits they will wear. Commander Lewis and Harold Kpeech discuss the latest weather forecast showing less favorable conditions in the Central States. The forecast indicates the chances the Navy can will be satisfactory, at least over central Illinois on Saturday to meet the 12. noon (EST) launching time. The balloon, maximum diameter 100 feet, will have a volume of 350,000 cubic feet. Record reach 75,000 feet is a present mark, maximum gondola carried aloft by a 128-foot plastic envelope balloon. Such as attained 100,000 feet or higher than the existing manned balloon record. New 11.1,820 foot mark was set here, a similar capsule from the same launching site. Commander Lewis and his party are optimistic about the flight, but caution is the watchword. The record attempt scheduled if there is a change for the better in the weather outlook.

NAVY BALLOON FLIGHT DELAYED

RAPID CITY, S.D.-(AP) - A Navy balloon flight from Sioux falls, scheduled for today, has been postponed at least one day, Capt. Norman Barr said.

The Navy medical officer said the flight was postponed when it was found the weather conditions would worsen.

Prevlously, General Mills and the Navy sponsored the flight which was to carry Capt. M. L. Lewis and Lt. M. D. Ross.

Winds up to 40 miles an hour and blowing snow forced the postponement of the launching of the plastic balloon which was to be made on the first good weather conditions, Barr said.
