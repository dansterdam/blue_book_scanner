Mr. [redacted] was of the opinion that such objects did not think scientists on earth had knowledge enough to develop such objects. He stated that no known scientist on earth had his opinion about these objects from another planet had to have canals to land in or on, therefore, it was his opinion that it is quite likely one (1) or more of these objects have landed in the inlets along lower California and that the occupants are probably presently living with Indians in that region.

Mr. [redacted] was seriously injured in a fire approximately two (2) years ago, losing a leg, parts of fingers, and seriously injuring his hands.

While interviewing Mr. [redacted], Mrs. [redacted] was introduced to the writer and when she learned what was being discussed she jokingly said: "I bet I could see 'flying saucers' if I were cut and looked for one long enough and used my imagination".
