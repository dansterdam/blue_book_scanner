Who called his attention to a light in the sky which he observed the light and it was in the shape of a large light bulb and its elevation was approximately 60 feet and was 75 yards away from him and appeared to be from a northwesterly direction. In a nearby cabin, he observed the light, which was steadily in a downward arc toward St. Georges Bay, that he observed the light for approximately 15 seconds and that when he last saw it, it was traveling in a northerly direction. Further questioning revealed that on approximately 20 April 1953 he had observed a lighted object in the sky approximately two miles away which was traveling in a south south easterly direction. That this light, appeared to be approximately six inches in diameter and that there was no bright glow from it and that it appeared to be traveling "slower and on air-level". He revisited the elevation approximately 15 seconds and that he hovered no noise from it and that when last seen, the light had dropped down over a hill at St. Mark's.

That as he watched it, it disappeared from sight it looked as though it was proceeding in a downward arc toward the ground and just as it appeared to be going to touch the Earth from the ball of fire. He stated that when the ball of fire passed over head it lighted up the area so much that the light from the object directed out the light from the lantern, that he could not estimate the time required for the object to pass from the first point of observation in the south to the point where it disappeared over the hill to the north but he stated that it appeared to be traveling at two or three times as fast as an aircraft normally seen flying in the area. He stated that his wife also observed light from the object on the same morning.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Sightings at Sheaves Cove, Newfoundland

1. On 7 May 1953 Major Jack P. Mills, Base Intelligence Officer, contacted Major WILLIAM J. O'LEARY, Detachment Commander, and informed him that there had been reports of unidentified sightings during the period of March and April 1953 in the vicinity of Sheaves Cove, Nfld.

2. On 8 May 1953 the writer and S/A Adams and Constable Larsen CORRIGAN, with Constable Peterson, Constabulis, Newfoundland, Canadian National, 30 years of age, Sheaves Cove, stated that some time in March 1953 as he was walking along the road near his brother's house, he did not know what he was looking at. At this time he saw a small, dark, coal black, roughly round object, behind his "lift up" and thought that it was a wedge behind him with bright head lights on.

S. Approximately one observed a light at approximately 650 feet in height. He stated he observed this light for approximately 5'6" in height. He stated he observed the light for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. From a neighbor he heard that four inches would appear to him in a light bulb with a halo of light. He observed the light from a distance of approximately 75 yards from the point of observation. Further questioning revealed that for a period of approximately 75 yards from the point he was standing, he could not see the last observed the light falling toward the sky in a downward arc and when last seen by him, it was approximately 300 ft above ground from shoulder height. Further, when the "object" was approximately 12 to 13 inches in diameter, he also stated that on the north 100% visibility.

Approximately 1733 hours, he was sitting in his house when, in the observation, he was traveling in a southeasterly direction. Major Mills noted that this light, which he viewed for approximately one to two seconds, also appeared like a light bulb and that it was approximately 18 inches in length and an angle of the flame of a kerosene lamp. He stated he did not observe any of the location's area lighted up from this object and that the object seemed like a light traveling far away and stated that he noticed that it appeared to be falling toward St. Georges Bay and was traveling "more or less as a million stars".

Another gentleman had observed unidentified lights in the sky. Major Mills offer no other identifying data regarding these people.
