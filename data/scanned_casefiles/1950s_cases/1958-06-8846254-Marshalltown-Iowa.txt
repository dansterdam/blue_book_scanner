Marshalltown, Iowa
June 7, 1958

Capt. Carl R. Surran, USAF
Commander
Det. #1, 4716th GO Sqdn.
601 South 6th Street
Springfield, Illinois

Dear Captain Surrans:

I am enclosing a fragment from an object that struck the roof of the trailer house of Tuesday nite, June 3rd, between 9 and 9:30 PM.

Mr. _______ brought this object to us last nite following a radio broadcast from our local radio station KFJB regarding a Russian appeal for information concerning their latest satellite.

Mr. _______ reported as follows: "When the object struck, it sounded like a loud report of a rifle", also that when he went out to investigate he found many fragments, this being the largest piece.

At this time he and his wife felt that this possibly was a fragment from a meteor. After hearing the broadcast they felt it should be turned over for investigation.

Will you please forward this to the proper department for investigation and let us know what the results are.

Yours very truly,
C. F. Kelley
Post Supervisor
