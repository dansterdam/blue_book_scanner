UNCLASSIFIED

23d SRDH [RHW] 28 September 1953

The object was sighted by commercial pilots
The pilots stated the object was a very bright silvery object approximately twice the size of a DC-3 aircraft

The object was observed from various angles and directions as follows:

The object was first observed at approximately 2245 GMT on 25 August 1953 by the pilot and co-pilot of a United Airlines DC-6 passenger aircraft flying from Los Angeles to Chicago. The pilots stated the object appeared to be a bright silvery disc or oval-shaped object, approximately twice the size of their aircraft, which was moving at a high rate of speed and climbing at a very steep angle. The pilots stated they were unable to identify the object.

The object was then observed by the pilot and co-pilot of a West Coast Airlines DC-3 passenger aircraft flying from Los Angeles to Seattle at approximately 2300 GMT on 25 August 1953. The pilots stated the object appeared to be a very bright silvery object, almost twice the size of their aircraft, which was climbing at a very steep angle and moving at a high rate of speed.

To date no definite explanation has been established for this observation.

OPERATORS COMMENTS: THIS REPORT FROM CLARK SEEMS VERY SIMILAR TO REPORTS RECEIVED RECENTLY FROM OTHER COMPETENT CIVIL AND MILITARY OBSERVERS REGARDING HIGHSPEED MANEUVERABLE OBJECTS OVER SOUTHWESTERNUSB. INTENSE WHITE LIGHTS OF APPARENT WEG DURATION OVER 3 SEC DURATION OVER A PERIOD OF MINUTES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED. OTHER VISUAL SIGHTINGS INDICATE SPEEDS OF MORE THAN 15,000 MPH. SOME THINK SIMILAR TO EXHAUST OF AIRCRAFT OR MISSILE TESTS REPORTED IN THIS AREA. USUALLY HAS NO TRAIL AND MADE NO SOUND AS REPORTED BY OBSERVERS. SEVERAL AIRCRAFT HAD NO AFTER JATO POWER TO ATTAIN SIMILAR SPEEDS RECORDED. OBJECT VAS NOT READILY IDENTIFIABLE BY CREWS AS TO SOURCE OR FUNCTION, CANNOT BE CORRELATED WITH ANY TYPE OF AIRCRAFT OR MISSILE KNOWN TO BE OPERATIONAL.

"AFTER CONSULTATION CREW CLARK, AMC OBSERVER ON DUTY AT THAT TIME IS NOT HERE UNDERSTOOD TO BE AND AS OPERATOR SAID OBJECT DISTANT SOUTH OF SRT. FLASHING BLUE GREEN LIGHT AND MAKING RAPID MANEUVER WAS NOT AIRCRAFT OR FAMILIAR OBJECT - AND HE ADVISED OBJECT WAS SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN A C-47. NO VAPOR TRAIL OR SOUND DETECTED."

COMMENTS OF PROJECT OFFICER:

A total lack of detailed information on flight path, size, shape, and color of object as well as lack of specific details on how the relative speed and size was determined makes further analysis of this report difficult. No photographic evidence is available from this sighting. The complete lack of technical details in the report is unfortunate for detailed analysis.
