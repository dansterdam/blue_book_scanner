AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1005th AIG
EWA AFB, Colo

AI33-1708-13-57        Part Two    Page 7    of    8

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORT:

1. SOURCE was taken to the scene of the sighting. As soon where the start of the incident was located, SOURCE stated that while the SOURCE was at the body of the object was about three feet from the ground, the SOURCE was unable to move a round the object due to the location where the object was located. SOURCE was unable to move a round for the purpose of taking pictures.

2. A farmer, was driving his truck about 2 miles from the scene at approximately the time of the incident when his motor stopped. A Kearney mechanic was called and replaced the points in the distributor. The mechanic stated that investigators that he had replaced a broken rotor in the farmers truck about 10 days before. The incident and that a piece of the broken rotor was found at that time. The piece of rotor lodged between the points and caused the failure.

3. The interview was concluded at approximately 1700 hours on 6 November 1957. Two qualified psychiatrists interviewed for a period of two hours. Their findings indicated that a mental condition was apparent. They also stated that with his particular mental condition, he would undoubtedly enjoy the publicity to be receiving from his relations, hearing of the county health board was held at 2000 hours that evening and...

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. SOURCE was asked to indicate when fifteen seconds had elapsed. He estimated the time after only five seconds and elapsed. SOURCE estimated 1500 feet. SOURCE estimated the width of the interview was accurate.

2. Investigators arrived to interview the SOURCE after he had been subjected to all-night questioning by city officials and newsmen. The SOURCE thus had ample time to firmly establish in his mind the answers to practically all questions. The investigators could conceivably ask. The above facts notwithstanding, the SOURCE's ready answers to all questions, particularly those which concerned minute details, detracted rather than lent authenticity to his story. SOURCE claimed a no-trailing observation of women were wearing, continued in such facts as existing being blues, grays and browns, and although he stated his vision was 20-20, he wore glasses.

3. The facts that; no supporting physical evidence (other than the oil spot which is viewed with suspicion) could be derived; his record of the incident was too detailed according to the investigating officer to conclude that the incident has no basis in fact, and that the SOURCE actually came to believe that he had witnessed the object.

Dear Colonel King:

This is to confirm telephonic communication between you and Assistant Special Agent in Charge, A. L. Mayer, about 9:00 p.m., November 5, 1957, concerning an alleged landing of a balloon in the vicinity of Kearney, Nebraska around 4:00 p.m., November 5, 1957.

The following information was furnished to our Resident Agent, Joseph R. Pattinson, at Grand Island, Nebraska, by Chief of Police, Thurston Nelson, Kearney, Nebraska:

Nelson stated that on the afternoon of November 5, 1957, an individual by the name of Caldwell, an employee of Brewster, California, a seed and feed company, Bakersfield, California, and at present a guest at the Fort Kearny Hotel, came to the Kearney Police Department and stated that about 4:00 p.m. he was looking over a mile south of where he was and in the vicinity of the Platte River with his flows near Kearney, he saw a car in the direction of the flash and as he neared the vicinity the motor in his car died and the battery would not turn it over. He said he left his car and walked a

short distance and near the river saw what he thought
was a Navy balloon. He said he walked toward the balloon,
which appeared silvery in color, 100 feet long, 30 feet
wide, 12 feet high, standing on four legs, and as he
neared the balloon two men alighted from the balloon and
directed a ray at him. He said the ray appeared to come
from a flashlight-like instrument and it made him completely helpless physically. At length he could still move
his eyes and think. He said these two men then searched him
and said his answer to their question "Do you know where
enter a door of the balloon and stand just within.

Mr. [redacted] said within the balloon were
two more men and two women. The four men were dressed in
conventional dress suits and the women in dresses. He
said the two men who met him outside were the only ones
of the six individuals who talked to him in English. He
said these two spoke perfect English and told him, "Tell
your people we mean no harm. We have been sighted before
in the United States but you are the first person to come
aboard."

they were [redacted] and told Nelson he asked them where
they were going and they told him they could not answer this question but in the near
future he and everyone else would know about these.
He told Nelson the two women aboard the balloon
maintained positions near the instrument panels and
spoke what he described as high German, which
each other and then only six men spoke. He stated
rather than walk they would slide from the instrument
to panel. He said all six passengers appeared to be 35
to 40 years of age and human. He said suddenly one of
the men told his they had to leave and he had to alight
from the balloon. He said he saw out of the balloon and
it immediately took off in a vertical direction. He said
after he had risen about 100 feet in the air it blanked
into the sky and he could see no trace of it. [redacted]
stated these men had a look as though they were not of

and he could see the surrounding countryside clearly.

Dear Sir:

Pursuant to our telephone conversation of yesterday, March 5, 1958, this is a follow-up of information that I have which might be helpful to you in anyway which you might desire to use it. Enclosed you will a copy of the type of hand bill that was circulated around Kearney, Nebraska on the 5th of March, advertising the lectures and also you will find mimeographed sheet which was handed out to persons who attended said lecture. A person who attended this lecture reported to me that there were only between 25 and 30 persons who attended the lecture. Whether or not there will be a larger crowd this evening, or continues, I cannot forecast. There was no advance notice through any of the new media that this program would be in town, so if the purpose was to make a mothy making venture out of this, it was poorly handled. The observer who reported to me concerning the meeting commented that there was much talk by Mr. Otto and Mr. Aho that the authorities, the Air Force, were doing everything they could to keep this information from the public, there was also a comment according to this observer that the Air Force Investigations attempted to have Mr. [illegible] take down everything he had to say.

My observer reports that Mr. [illegible] related at the lecture the same he had another contact with this same group on the 5th of February, 1958 near Elm Creek, Nebraska, a few miles west of here. He supposedly took a ride in it this time.

I am also enclosing in this letter a copy of the report provided to me by the particulars. As I recall, you asked me to furnish you such a report.

I doubt that this is of particular interest, however, it is forwarded to you in the outside chance that it may be of value.

KEARNEY, NEBRASKA "SPACE SHIP" INCIDENT
5 November 1957

On the morning of 5 November 1957, the Air Force received a UFO report, which, within a few hours had drawn nation-wide attention, and was given some prominence by both the press and television. According to (unofficial) reports, a space ship had landed on U.S. soil, was observed by a man named _______, who was driving nearby, and who, upon stopping to investigate was invited into the space ship by its crew.

According to _______, a seed salesman, a flash of light from the ship stopped his car. It came from a nearby river bed, on which rested an object that he thought was a balloon. When he approached it, another flash of light came out of the space ship which paralyzed _______ momentarily, making him incapable of walking.

a. Two men came out and asked if he was armed and then searched him. After the search, he was able to move and walk again, and he asked them what the ship was, and what they were doing. They said they couldn't tell him. He asked to see it closer and they said that as long as they couldn't leave for a few minutes, he might as well look at it. They started back to the ship and as they got close, a door opened on the left side. When he got into the ship he noticed that there were four men and two women. They all spoke to him in German.

29 JULY 1958

THE DAYTON DAILY NEWS
INTER-PLANETARY:

Saucers Real,
Researcher Says

ALAMOGORDO, N. M., July 29—(JP)—Dr. Carl Jung, Swiss psychologist, says in a report that Unidentified Flying Objects are real and "have signs of intelligent guidance by quasi-human pilots."

"I can only say for certain these things are not a mere rumor. Something has been established," Jung said in a report released yesterday. "A purely psychological explanation is ruled out."

Jung, who studied his research through the UFO filter center of the aerial phenomena research organization here, it was released by L. J. Lorenzen.

"I have gathered a mass of observations of unidentified flying objects since 1944," Jung said.

"THE DISCS do not behave in accordance with physical laws, but as though without weight.

"If the extra-terrestrial origin of this phenomena should be confirmed this would prove the existence of an intelligent relationship, which would be momentous. What such a fact might mean for human consciousness cannot be predicted."

"But it would put us without doubt in an extremely curious position of primitive communities in contact with the superior culture of the white race."

These machines proves a scientific technique immensely at variance with ours cannot be argued.

WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP BREAK THROUGH THE SECRECY ON
THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OR FLYING SAUCERS

It is known that Radar Reports and other data on UFO's (Unidentified
Flying Objects) or Flying Saucers is under the wraps of secrecy in the Military.
All information is collected but the public is kept in the dark of this vital subject. What information is released is distorted and misplaced. Why should this
be so, asks the alert, intelligent American who pays the TAX for all of this.
There is a rising demand from the citizens of KNOW about all of the hidden
facts and rightly so. A Constitutional Democracy cannot endure without an informed
electorate.

THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. Write intelligence letters to your STATES SENATORS & CONGRESSMEN -- also
your UNITED STATES SENATORS & CONGRESSMEN. Ask for a flow of information on
this subject. Ask them to set as your elected Representatives in this matter to
know the truth about these mysterious reaches the public.

2. Tell them about local interest, local sightings of UFO's, photos, Clubs
activities.

3. Ask that a civilian board be appointed to collect this information and
these reports, let the people awake those reports and this information. It belongs to the people.

The Armed Services Committee by: -- Sen. Richard B. Russell, Ga., Chairman,
Senate Committee on Govt Operations, Sen. John L. McClellan, Ark., Chairman,
House Committee on Govt Operations, Congressman John E. Moss, Chairman,
Govt Appropriations, Sen. Clarence Cannon, Mo., Chairman (House) Govt Appropriations.

If the right committee for the job (Interplanetary Study) does not exist,
ask that immediate steps be taken to accomplish this. MAJOR WAYNE S. ARGO, Washington Saucer Intelligence, P.O. Box 815, Washington 4, D.C. has been to every
Govt's office and every Congressman's office on this subject, and is constantly
working on Capitol Hill, until results are obtained. He has been told by government officials in the Senate and House that there is NO COMMITTEE IN EXISTENCE
that is qualified for this specific assignment. Interplanetary Research is unique
and new to our time. It is time for action to correct this weakness.

How else can we enter the AGE of SPACE?

5. It is time for us to face the issue squarely. The time has come for
forthright answers. Let us end the doubletalk and evasion.

6. Request a REPLY

If America is to enter the SPACE AGE with honor, let us face up to the
responsibilities of the Space age. Let us -- rather than attempt to conquer space
begin to UNDERSTAND Space. With this approach -- we too can become SPACE TRAVELERS

Here are two forms to address your letters:
For a Senator:     Honorable Charles S. Potter
                   United States Senate, Washington 25, D. C.

For a Congressman: Honorable Gerald R. Ford, Jr.
                   House of Representatives, Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Sir -- or Dear Senator Potter --------- Very truly yours,
Dear Sir -- or Dear Mr. Ford -------------- Very truly yours,

This is how YOU can help in bringing about many wonderful events.
                        Now let us hear from you.

KEARNEY, NEBRASKA "SPACE SHIP" INCIDENT
5 November 1957

b. The space ship was described as approximately 100 feet long, 15 feet high, and 30 feet wide and rested on metal supports or "pads".

c. [Redacted] stated that the interior was about forty feet long. Instruments mounted on aluminum stands lined the sides of the interior. He was unable to describe exactly any instrumentation except to say that a variety of circular and linear dials of various sizes were noticed. Both Roman numerals and ordinary numbers were noted on the dials. [Redacted] stated that the interior of the object was lighted from an invisible source.

No noise other than the crew talking was heard. It was possible to see through the sides, bottom and floor of the object, being perfectly transparent.

d. After 25 or 30 minutes they bid [Redacted] goodbye and asked him to leave. The ship suddenly rose above the tree tops and sped off in a Southwesterly direction, without a sound being made.

[Redacted] was taken to the scene of the sighting by Air Force Investigators.

No marks where the struts of the object had rested were visible because the area had been walked over by newsmen. While he had stated that the body of the object was about three feet from the ground, many dry weeds and some scrub trees of four or five feet high were unbroken in the location where the object rested. He was unable to provide a reason for this.

Ya, Das Was
Eine Grosse
Space Ship

A traveler in Nebraska said last night with the ordinary-appearing occupants of an apparent space ship, Reinhold O. Schmidt, 58, of Bakersfield, Calif., came into Kearney, Nebr., white faced and shaken and asked to see a minister.

He told of talking with six occupants of a transparent "space ship" parked for repairs outside town, and struck up the story through repeated questioning by authorities.

Many other sightings of unidentified flying objects were attributed by scientists to tricks of vision in persons who actually saw the bright planet Venus, Dr. Donald H. Menzel, director of Harvard University's observatory, said.

In Kearney, Mr. Schmidt, a grain buyer who once served a prison term for embezzlement, appeared to be ordinary except for his story of the ship with its four men and two women passengers who appeared to be ordinary mortals in ordinary clothes. They spoke to him in German and to him in English, Mr. Schmidt said.

Flying Object Stories Keep 'Zooming Up'

An ex-convict stuck to his story of a chat with spacemen Wednesday and a Tennessee schoolboy identified "living objects" zooming about the skies.

Reports of more strange, unidentified flying objects zooming about the skies came from many other sections of the country and across the seas.

Some reports were taken seriously and air force officials were investigating them.

The most dramatic and eye-browraising stories came from Reinhold O. Schmidt, a grain dealer who claimed he walked to kidnap his dog at Kearney, Neb., and Everett Clark, 12 years old, who said spacemen tried to kidnap his dog at Knoxville, Tenn.

SCHMIDT, 48 years old, appeared to be weakening in his story after intensive questioning by two Army intelligence officers and two investigators from the Continental Air Defense Command.

Schmidt, a Bakersfield, Cal., native, came driving into Kearney late Tuesday with a story that he had come upon a silvery cigar-shaped space ship outside of town.

Authorities half-believed there was something to his story when he revealed as a former convict who served time in the Nebraska penitentiary for embezzlement.

At Knoxville, Everett Clark said he saw "a long round spacecraft" settle down in a cow pasture right outside his window Wednesday.

The placement were either nasty or long-woven, Everett said. Friday, he said and then tried to kidnap another dog before they flew away.

EVERETT'S FATHER said the boy "is not given to telling stories." And a newspaper reporter and photographer said they saw "a peculiar imprint in the grass." 24 feet long and 5 feet thick.

Other reports of strange sky objects included:
- Pell City, Ala., said his car battery went dead Wednesday and he looked up to see "something" 200 feet up and 600 feet long.
- Residents of four Centralia, Wash. area communities said they saw a brilliant white vapor trail shooting from the ground to the moon.
- An object the size of a small-sized football barely missed a 3-year-old girl and landed with a whistle and a thump in a schoolyard at Sunbury-On-Thames, England.
- Two crewmen of a Coast Guard cutter were reported tracking a UFO on radar in the Gulf of Mexico were taken to New York for questioning.

NEW CONTACTS

Flying Saucer 'Rider'
Lands in Prison Cell

Reinhold O. Schmidt, 64, told of a 1955 encounter with former Bakersfield resident 200-ft. spacecraft from Saturn. He claimed he had contact turn on a lonely Bakersfield road and of a subsequent meeting with six inhabitants of a 1-10 year prison sentence craft. He had lectured Saturday in Oakland on two before several Los Angeles groups interested in flying saucers.

Schmidt was convicted of persuading a 63-year-old widow to invest $5,000 in mines he discovered while orbiting the earth in a spaceship.

Evidence at his trial indicated that he obtained "investments" of nearly $50,000 from others.

In 1960 while he was living in Bakersfield, Schmidt also claimed that he had talked with occupants of a spaceship in which he said he had landed in a creek bottom near Kearney, Neb., in 1957.

REINHOLD SCHMIDT, 43, A GRAIN DEALER FROM BAKERSFIELD, CALIF., SAID THE INHABITANTS OF THE "WHATNIK" SPOKE IN ENGLISH AND GERMAN AND TOLD HIM AT THAT TIME YOU WILL FIND OUT WHAT WE ARE DOING.

HE SAID HE FOUND THE FLYING MACHINE ON A FARM NEAR GRAND ISLAND, NEB., WAS DISPATCHED TO KEARNEY TO INVESTIGATE.

POLICE CHIEF THURSTON NELSON MEANWHILE BACKED UP SOME DETAILS OF THE CLAIM.

HE SAID HE FOUND THE FOOTPRINTS OF TWO MEN APPROACHING A SINGLE SET OF FOOTPRINTS, PRESUMABLY FROM A SANDY EXPANSE OUTSIDE KEARNEY.

THE THREE FOOTPRINTS THEN ADVANCED TOGETHER AND SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED, AS IF THEY HAD BEEN YANKED UPWARDS, NELSON SAID.

POLICE SAID THEY ALSO FOUND A GREENISH GREASE-LIKE FLUID ABOUT THE AREA WHERE SCHMIDT DROVE INTO KEARNEY LATE TODAY, WHITE-FACED AND ASKING TO SEE A MINISTER.

HE SAID HE WAS DRIVING NEAR KEARNEY IN SOUTH-CENTRAL NEBRASKA ON A GRAVEL-BUYING EXPEDITION WHEN HE SPOTTED A SILVERY OBJECT WHICH LOOKED LIKE A NAVY BLIMP.

"I GOT OUT, WALKED CLOSER. IT WAS 100 FEET LONG, 30 FEET WIDE, AND 14 FEET HIGH," AND STANDING ON FOUR POSTS.

"AS I APPROACHED, A RAMP LIKE A STAIRCASE CAME OUT. TWO MEN EMERGED AND CAME FLASHING A LIGHT. FOR SECONDS, I COULDN'T MOVE. THEN ONE SAID 'WE'LL HAVE TO BE HERE A LITTLE WHILE'--YOU MAY AS WELL COME INSIDE."

HE ENTERED THE CONTRAPTION, AND TWO WOMEN, THEY SEARCHED HIM AND SPOKE WITH A GERMAN ACCENT, HE SAID.

THE WOMEN WERE BRUNETTES, ALL OF THEM WERE DRESSED IN EVERYDAY CLOTHES, AND TWO OF THE MEN WORE MUSTACHES.

THE WALLS OF THE SHIP WERE TRANSPARENT FROM INSIDE, SCHMIDT SAID.

THE WOMEN APPEARED TO BE WORKING ON THE SHIP'S WIRING AND ALL THE PASSENGERS SEEMED TO MOVE ABOUT THE SHIP ON A CONVEYOR OR MAGNETIC FIELD, HE SAID.

"THEY TOLD ME TO LOOK AROUND BUT THEY WOULDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SHIP," SAID. "ALL THEY WOULD SAY IS 'TELL THE PEOPLE WE'RE DOING NO HARM.'"

ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT TALLY WITH COMMON CONCEPTS OF SPACE TRAVEL, SCHMIDT INSISTED THE BIG BALLOON WAS PROPELLED BY TUBES FITTED WITH HUGE PROPELLERS.

FINALLY, HE SAID, THE "SPACE PEOPLE" TOLD HIM TO GET OUT, ASSURING HIM HIS CAR WOULD START.

AS HE RETURNED TO HIS AUTO, HE SAID, "THE THING JUST TOOK OFF IN THE AIR LIKE A HELICOPTER. IT SEEMED TO CHANGE COLOR AND BLEND INTO THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT I THINK IT WAS GOING SOUTHEAST."

THE "WHATNIK" FADED AWAY, HE TRIED TO START HIS CAR AND SUCCEEDED ON THE THIRD TRY.

Flying Saucers OCT 59

The
KEARNEY
INCIDENT
By
Reinhold O. Schmidt

There has been so much controversy regarding the strange adventures of Richard O. Schmidt in contacting a flying saucer which eventually took him for a ride that we have asked him for his own story. Here it is...

My name is Reinhold O. Schmidt. I am a grain buyer from California. On October 25, 1957, I was transferred from Arizona to Kearney, Nebraska, by my employer, a firm of Braw, California. At other times of the year I buy grain for another company of Los Angeles, California. In leaving Arizona, I left a foreman in charge of my corn picking and shelling operations at Willcox, Arizona. I was using three Minneapolis-Moline pickers shelters there which I had purchased on contract.

The afternoon of November 5, a dark and misty day, I was inspecting some fields of milo and corn that I had bought, and some that I planned to buy. I was four miles south, and a mile east of Kearney, when I turned to the left on a river road to inspect a large field of milo. After looking it over, at about 2:30 P.M., I drove to an abandoned farm

home to turn around. Just as I was about to turn into the drive, I noticed a large bright flash about a quarter of a mile ahead of me. I figured somebody was blasting trees- although I heard no report- and instead of turning around I decided to drive ahead and see what was going on.

I drove toward the river bank and when I was within approximately 100 feet of it, my car stopped. I turned the switch off and on several times, and stepped on the starter, but it was completely dead. I wondered if the rough road had jiggled some of the wires loose. When I looked up I saw what appeared to me to be a large half-inflated balloon. I got out of the car and walked toward it; coming around a clump of willows and tall grass I got a better look at it, and I realized it wasn't a balloon, but a large silvery ship of some kind of metal that looked

KEARNEY, NEBRASKA "SPACE SHIP" INCIDENT
5 November 1957

A spot of oil about 24 inches in diameter was found on the ground below where the object was located. The greenish oil covered the dry leaves and it was possible to obtain a sample from pools made on the leaves.

A Veedol quart-oil can was found about 30 feet from the location of the oil spot. The Veedol 10-30 can was identical to an unopened can found in the trunk of car. A beer-type can opener found in his car made identical opening marks as on the can found at the scene.

After being interviewed by Air Force and other government investigators, was examined by qualified psychiatrists for approximately two hours, who found that was definitely

It was also disclosed that

The incident was adjudged a Hoax.

fascinated me was the way the oc-
cupants would glide instead of walk
across the floor when they stepped
back from the instrument panels!
Although it worked like an escalator,
I couldn't see anything move, and
when I tried it, it didn't work for
me. I wondered if they had some-
thing special on their shoes.

All of the occupants of the ship
greeted me and bid me farewell. In
leaving, they said, "We will see you
again." (Little did I realize that
they meant what they said!) Other
than that, the one man did all the
talking. And by the way, this man
looked and talked just like a man
that was watching TV with me in
the hotel lobby the night before. On
the ship he said, "Tell your people
we know that they have seen this
ship before and they will see it a-
gain."

He also asked me if I knew any-
thing about the U.S. satellite pro-
gram. I said I did not. Then he said,
"Yes, they're planning to send some
up, but the first two will never leave
the ground and the third one will
go up, but won't send back much
data."

This prophecy has since proved it-
self.

May all space to me in the Eng-
lish language with what seemed to
me to be a German accent. Among
themselves they talked high Ger-
man which I could understand as I
graduated from a school where they
spoke and taught German as well as
English, and I was able to speak,
read and write German at that time.

I can still understand it and speak
it fairly well.

After being inside the ship about
30 minutes, one man said to the
other, "Wir sind fertig" (Translated,
this means, "We are finished." So
the leader told me, "You will have
to leave now." I was glad to hear
this, for I wondered if I would ever

get off that ship again.

When I stepped off the stairs onto
the ground the motor started. It
sounded like a large electrical motor
to me, and the more momentum it
picked up, the quieter it got. It ran
for about twelve seconds and then
the ship took off straight up into
the air. Approximately twelve feet
off the ground the entire ship turn-
ed a pitch black; when it was about
one hundred feet in the air it turn-
ed to a blush green. Then it head-
ed southwest - there was a brilliant
flash - and the ship disappeared
before my very eyes! I estimated the
ceiling of the clouds that day to be
only about eight hundred feet, but
the ship disappeared long before it
hit the ceiling - I judged at about
one hundred fifty feet from the
ground. It was reported to me later
by a county official that it had stall-
ed a tractor, two cars and a large
truck that were beneath its path.

While aboard the ship I was told
not to start my car until they were
out of sight as it wouldn't start any-
way. This was the first time I knew
that the ship had stopped my auto-
mobile. After the ship disappeared
(about 3:15 P.M.) I went back to
my car - now it started - I turned
it around and started for Kearney.

Then the impact of the experience
had hit me, and I was so shaken I
had to stop the car and pull myself
together.

I debated whether to report my
experience or not. I was afraid in
the report of the ship spot out, people
wouldn't believe it, and I might lose
my job. Then I remembered that
over radio and TV that the govern-
ment wanted skywatchers and that
they were to report any unidentified
objects in the skies. I realized then
it was really my duty as a citizen
to report the ship. In fact, my own
idea at the time was that this was
a Russian ship manned by German

their oil did not smell. Later, I discovered some of the oil had been poured out in the trunk of my car and over my laundry. I ask you, what man would leave a half-full can of oil standing in the trunk of his car?

Although it was reported to me that the two Air Force officials from Colorado Springs, Colorado, arrived in Kearney during the night, they did not meet or talk to me until about 11 a.m. the following morning (November 6). Then they asked me to tell them of my experience and to relate what I saw.

While in this session, one of the local officials from Kearney wondered out loud how the ship could go straight up. Forgetting himself, one of the Air Force officials said, "Oh, we know what makes it go straight up."

In the meantime, local officials went back on the air and TV and denounced my experience as a hoax. Once I was confined to the jail, I was cut off from all phone calls and contacts. My employer placed a person-to-person call to me for three days that was never completed.

The next day (November 7) there was talk about a mental hearing. I was asked to get to a telephone; I wanted to call my brothers and have them bring one of their attorneys. The officials wouldn't permit me to use the phone.

"We have good attorneys here in Kearney," they said. And running through the list of attorneys in the phone book, "Here's a good fellow." They called him and when he arrived I saw was the assistant city attorney.

The first thing he said was, "We don't believe your story, and we want you to change it."

"Well, I have news for you," I said. "I don't want you for my attorney."

But the next day it was announced in the local paper that I had an attorney of my choice.

About 11 o'clock at night then (November 7), I was called to a meeting of a mental hearing board. Members of the board were:
The chief of police
The county attorney
The clerk of the district court
The deputy sheriff
A doctor

This meeting was held behind locked doors in an upstairs room above the fire department. A local man announced he knew the meeting was to be held and was trying to locate it - he inquired all around town until he finally found out from a local cop, too late to attend the meeting.

When the doctor arrived he asked me just three questions:
1. "How do you feel about the people of Kearney, Nebraska?"
I said I had no hard feelings to ward anyone.

2. "Do you still maintain that you saw that ship?"
"I certainly do."

3. "Are you willing to go to the mental hospital and have some mental tests?"
"No," and I further answered that I did not intend to go to the hospital, and if they insisted on taking me they would have to pay the bill.

In about fifteen minutes I was on the way to the hospital at Hastings, Nebraska, accompanied by the chief of police, the county attorney and the deputy sheriff. On the way up the fellows kidded me about having pretty nurses and a nice rest.

"Well, fellows," I said, "You can have your fun now. I'll have mine later on."

I was admitted to the hospital that night.
Before the hearing, however, one of the local officials called my brother-

battery was blown off and lost.
This time I said nothing about my
experience to anyone in Kearney.
Instead, that night I tried to call
Major Wayne Aho, of Washington,
Saucer Intelligence, in Washington,
D. C. Major Aho said I had some
telephone conversations and correspondence as a result of my first
contact. He was out of town. I reached him a few days later, however, in
Detroit. He was on a mid-west lecture tour at the time, and we arranged to meet in Denver, Iowa,
on February 17. I told of my experience at a public meeting for the first
time the next night. I joined Major
Aho then in his tour of the Middle
West and East.

Two lectures were given in Kearney, Nebraska, on Wednesday and
Thursday nights, March 5 & 6 -
and I went to tell you what happened the evening of the first lecture
in Kearney - the space ships put on
a regular show for fifty minutes in
the western sky:

Shortly before 6:30 P.M. the evening of March 5, a local radio commentator with whom we had visited
that afternoon called our hotel room.

"Don't quote me," he said, "but
there is something in the western
sky above the sun."

We looked out our west window, and there above the setting sun
we could see what appeared to be a
large white star. But that was neither the time nor place for such a start.

Then, about six or seven minutes
later, another object appeared to the
left of the star." It was round and
dark, but soon an orange glow appeared at the bottom, which became
brighter as we watched. Then this
object moved and dipped and showed a dome-like structure. Later, the
orange color faded and changed to
red, which became quite brilliant
before fading out until the entire
object became invisible - as a light

fading out under rheostatic control.

A few minutes later the white object changed to an orange color -
then blue - and then gradually faded
from sight.

Needless to say, all four of us on
the lecture team were excited and
thrilled with this display and support of our activities there in Kearney.

Looking at the western sky again
one of the group called, "Here comes
a jet from the right." A moment or
two later, however, there was neither
an object nor vapor trail to be seen.
And then another "jet" appeared on
the left side of the western sky. This
time, however, we watched, and we
soon realized the gray object was not
a jet. Looking more closely we could
see it was cigar-shaped with a blinking red light in its nose, and instead
of a vapor trail it had a bushy tail
of scintillating light that moved along with it.

This object moved across the western sky from left to right and disappeared in the distance at 7:19 P.M.
- just giving us time enough to get
off for the lecture scheduled for
7:25.

A traveling salesman who came
to the lecture that night later told
us he had seen part of the display
coming into the hotel that evening.
In the dining room of the hotel he
reported the "show" had been the
main topic of conversation.

"Well, they're having a lecture on
spaceships tonight," the man sharpening his table remarked. "Wouldn't
you know they would have some kind
of a gimmick!"

"That would be a good trick," the
salesman replied, "but how in the
world did they get them so high?"

It was reported to us that the
manager of the hotel where we were
staying called the Lowry Air Force
Base in Colorado and was informed,
"It was a balloon."

and said, "If any of your friends are
watching you now, they will not be
able to see you."

But I could still see the entire
countryside. I asked them while in
flight what propelled their ship -
"By the power of the sun," they said.
"We get our power from the sun
and from the earth." Inside and
Inside the ship it was like sitting
in your living room. As far as sensation was concerned, there simply
wasn't any, either in flight or in the
ascent or descent.

The ship landed on the dry river
bed again among the leaves. Incidentally, both times the ship landed
on what is called accretion land.
That is land that cannot be sold or
owned privately, only leased by the
owner of the adjoining land. At one
time this land was part of the river
bottom covered with water. Then the
river channel was deepened and narrowed by man, and this part of the
river bed grew up in grass and brush
and trees. I have since wondered if
they purposely chose this land so
that they would not be trespassing
on private property. Also, it may be
interesting to note that Kearney
is located on Highway 30, in the middle of the United States from east
to west. At a point just outside of
Kearney it is 1733 miles to San
Francisco and 1733 miles to Boston.

The favor they wanted of me was
the answers to three questions:
1. What would the United States
do if other planets were to set off
atomic bombs and to start Sputniks
and other satellites flying around
which would affect the earth and
interrupt its radio and TV operations
and other devices?

2. What was the plane carrying
that disintegrated over the Pacific
on the way from San Francisco to
Honolulu besides passengers?

3. How would your people react if a
fleet of these ships would land on a

friendly mission? Would they accept
us on friendly terms?

I promised to try to get the answers, and if they would give me
their address, I said I would gladly
forward this information to them.
The spokesman smiled and said,
"We will contact you again."

Then I asked how I happened to
know I was on this road, or do you pick up
just anybody?"

"No," he answered, and then he
said, "Your people have fingerprints
for identification; we have your
brain impulses and can pick you up
at any time."

Then I suggested I might be in
California by the time I got the answers for them.

"That doesn't make any difference," he said. "We can pick you up
any place, any time."

And when I left the ship, they
said, "Goodbye, we'll see you again."

Although they asked me no questions the first time they met, they
seemed to know all about me, and
this second time, Reinhold, I told them
my first name, Reinhold. I told them
about all the trouble I had for reporting their first visit.

"Yes, we know about it," I was
told, "and we were standing by. It
they hadn't released you from the
hospital by a certain time we would
have put on a mass demonstration
over Kearney and made ourselves
known."

When we were back at my car and
I was about to leave they said, "We
have stopped your car twice now,
and if we stop it a third time your
battery will be dead."

Both times my battery boiled dry.
I have a twelve-volt battery with a
three-year guarantee. It is a little
over a year old. The black top coating of this battery has holes blown
in it from the excess pressure when
they stopped the car. The second

THE KEARNEY INCIDENT

"San Francisco, Cal. (AP)—The Pan American Strato-cruiser Romanza of the Skies was carrying shipments of chemicals and 'radio-active' materials when it crashed in the Pacific, killing all 44 persons aboard. Civil Aeronautics Board hearing was told Wednesday.

"The huge airliner, bound from San Francisco to Honolulu, mysteriously plunged into the ocean about midway between the two points last November 8. Only 19 bodies were recovered.

"The first witness before the seven-man hearing panel was David L. Thompson, Santa Monica, Cal., head of the team of CAB Investigators who have spent the last two months seeking clues from the wreckage.

"Mr. Thompson said one thing certain was that the plane had burned after its struck water.

"Mr. Thompson said the plane carried a shipment of 'yellow label sodium sulfite' restricted cargo package in accordance with ICC regulations."

"In addition, he said, there was 'White label radioactive material' aboard the plane.

"Mr. Thompson offered no solution to one of the prime mysteries of the tragedy - the riddle of why the crewmen were unable to send a distress message in the 23 minutes from the time it last gave a position to the time it struck water."

I cannot say what this information is the complete answer to their questions, and I something to think about, and I wonder if I have wasn't the real purpose of their questions anyway. As to the other two questions, that is something for each of us to answer for ourselves.

As a friend of mine says, "A good teacher asks the students questions to make them think."

During the latter part of April, 1958, I attended a meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. After the meeting a group of us were sitting in the hotel coffee shop when one of the space people came in and asked us outside the hotel, and we drove out toward the spot where the spacecraft had landed. We went approximately six miles down the highway, then turned off the pavement onto a country road. Almost immediately a beam of light shot out from the ship, which was sitting nearby, and the driver of the car then followed the beam, went up onto the ramp, and we were soon inside the ship.

I remained inside the craft with the space people for about two hours. During which they told me several things which I do not yet have permission to reveal in the public.

I spent a part of the month of June buying grain in Nebraska and Colorado. While in Denver I was again contacted. This time they asked me if I would like to go with them to the Arctic Circle some time in August. I answered that I would drop all my work in order to go with them. I then asked why they had chosen the Arctic Circle. They replied, "Let's just say for an educational purpose."

On August 14, 1958, while in my Hollywood apartment, one of the space men came again. He said they were ready to leave for the Arctic Circle and if I was ready they would take off that evening. I told them I would have to make a few telephone calls first, and asked where they wished to pick me up. They instructed me to drive down to a rock quarry on Highway 6, about forty miles north of Mojave. The region around the quarry is rather desolate and I suggested that I would put my car in a garage as I did not wish to leave it there. They said, "No, take your car and drive

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

"I turned off the highway to the north to inspect a field of milo (sorghum).
I tried to turn back after checking the milo but the road was too narrow. I went
further north looking for a spot to turn around. When I came to a gate in the road,
I stopped the car and was going to turn around. At this time I noticed a flash of
light coming from the river bed in front of me. I decided to go and see what it was.
When I got within sixty (60) feet of the river bank, my motor stopped. I didn't think
much of this because I had been going over rough roads and thought something might
come else might have jarred loose. I tried the ignition several times and stopped on the
starter but it wouldn't go. I then noticed the object rising in the river bed and
at first thought that it might be a balloon that had crashed there. I got out of
the car and walked walking toward the object. Then I got about two (2) or three (3)
hundred yards from the car and stopped. I could see it was a ship or object similar
of the ship and seemed to partially be and I couldn't walk. I was approximately
thirty (30) feet from the object. No (2) man came out and I was surprised. After
this search, I got to where I could move and walk again. After the car, I still
and I asked them what the gang was and what they were doing. They said they couldn't

leave for a few minutes, I might as well look at it. When I got close to the ship
and as we got close a door opened on the left side. When I went into the ship, I
noticed that there was four (4) men and two (2) women. They all spoke to me. The
one (1) stayed with me most of the time, but they told me that they couldn't tell
me anything about the ship. They did tell me they to be a human race from another
world. They said they were in the ship about twenty-five (25) or thirty (30) minutes.
Then they said they would have to leave and they said nobody and wishes the road back and
I stopped the car and they said goodbye and I walked back to the car. I stepped back
eight (8) or ten (10) feet, but when the machine started working I thought there was
still some terrible blast, so I stepped back further, almost to the river bank. But
there was no blast. It just was a small ship, into the air and then it went away. It
was about fifty (50) feet, it took off in a southwesterly direction. Then it
went about sixty (60) feet above the trees, it changed color, turned, and went away."

THE KEARNEY INCIDENT                                                   41

The remark is often made, "How come there are no witnesses to a space ship landing?"

I don't know that I can answer that fully, but in the case of my experience of November 5, I understand there may be a number of witnesses for there were running and construction workers in the vicinity.

In fact, a local radio announcer in Kearney allegedly has a tape recording of two business men in Kearney who testified that they heard a series of sounds while pheasant hunting the afternoon of my contact, that they believed came from the ship. This same announcer checked with the Lowry Air Force Base and learned that they had no aircraft aloft the afternoon of November 5 between 1:00 and 6:00 P.M. due to the low ceiling and hazardous flying conditions.

Also, many folks are wondering why the occupants of the ship spoke German. Again, I don't really know. But oddly enough, when my boss came to Kearney to see me after my release from the hospital he had with him a business associate from Mexico - a man who was very much interested. In my experience, after I finished telling him about it he told me that he had encountered a similar ship in Mexico 11, too, was occupied by four men and two women - only they talked in Spanish! You will have to draw your own conclusions.

Another thing I am often asked is, "Did you ever read any books on flying saucers before your experience, or were you interested in the subject?"

I had heard something about flying saucers, as everyone has over the years, from reports and news papers, etc. But I had never paid any particular attention to them until this incident, I believe. As I have often said, "I didn't believe, I didn't disbelieve but they

certainly made a believer out of me!" As to books, I hadn't read any on the subject before my experience, and I haven't read any since either.

Now I'm going to conclude my report, as of April 5, 1958, when I received some information from NICAP (National Investigations Committee for Aerial Phenomena). Visitors asked me. (What was the plane carrying the two passengers, be- sides passengers?) NICAP sent me copies of two relevant newspaper articles which I am copying for your information. The first is a story from the Des Moines Register, dated November 9, 1957:

"A large Stratocruiser, enroute between San Francisco and Honolulu, is reported missing after having sighted mysterious blinking lights in the sky early this morning. The last position given by the plane was about 900-1000 miles northeast of Honolulu. A military transport flying near the area reported sighting similar mystery lights, blinking off and on, 120 miles north of the last reported position of the Stratocruiser. After it had been reported missing. A full scale sea and air search is in operation with vain efforts to find the plane carrying a crew of 4 and 36 passengers in the event it might have plunged into the sea."

(Note: Later reports said 44 aboard.)

Was there a suggestion that space-ships (mysterious blinking lights) might have caused the accident, I wondered, and was that why my spaceship friends wanted me to find out what else that ship was carrying besides passengers?

Then another news clipping, an AP dispatch from Omaha World Herald, January 16, 1958, in the Omaha World Herald gave the following information:

"Radio-Active Cairo Field—Mystery of Plane's Crash Unsolved"

it up to the quarry and we will take
the Buick along." I told them it
really wasn't necessary because I
could leave it at a garage, for the
car weighs about two tons and it
would be a lot of extra weight. Their
reply was, "Weight doesn't mean
anything."

I made my telephone calls and
then drove out to the quarry. I saw
that the ship was already there. It
was a larger ship than I had seen
before, being about two hundred feet
long, forty feet wide, and fourteen
feet in height. Other than size and
the fact that it contained a few less
instruments, this ship was almost
identical in appearance and furnish-
ing with the ship I saw near Kear-
ney, Nebraska. The personnel was
the same.

There is a large eighteen or twenty
feet steel galvanized tank beside my
quarry, fed by a spring, which was
placed there by the Government for
animals such as deer and cattle to
drink from. The space people had
drawn about half of the water from
the tank - probably fourteen or fif-
teen barrels. The space people use
water in the ship to keep it cool.

As soon as I arrived, they let the
ramp down on the fore and aft of the
ship and I drove the Buick up on
it; they lifted the ramp - and we
started for the North Pole!

We left the quarry at 4:15 in the
afternoon. An hour and twenty min-
utes later we were over the Arctic
Circle, having made three stops, one
in Greenland for about thirty min-
utes, and two short stops in Alaska
to check on some minerals. At one
time during the flight I asked them
how fast the ship could go. They
answered that they would give me
a fast ride. At that time we were
approximately six or seven miles
high, and for a few minutes, accord-
ing to an instrument which I would
call a speedometer, we went 40,000

miles an hour. They said the craft
would go a lot faster but that we
did not have enough distance to
really turn it loose. There was no
vibration, and the only way I could
tell we had gone so high was the
appearance of the earth below us.
The earth was almost obscured by
what appeared to be rings similar
to those we see around the planet
Saturn. The predominating color was
blue-green showing through the sil-
very rings of haze. This same ship
can be used as a plane in the air, a
ship on the water, or a submarine
beneath the water. While in the air
the ship flew broadside.

As we were flying over the Arctic
Circle they pointed out many inter-
esting things. They showed me a
place where once there were iceaps
a thousand or so feet high. Today it
is a lake. They told me this was
caused by atomic bombs changing
our atmosphere so that it is be-
coming warmer in some places and
colder in others. The Arctic Circle
has been cold for thousands of years,
but today the ice is melting.

We settled down on the open wa-
ter, then submerged beneath the ice-
cap to a depth of approximately
three or four hundred feet, where
we remained for three or four hours.
While underneath the surface or
the water I saw something which
has never yet been revealed to the
public. I have written to Washing-
ton asking permission to give out
this information but at the date of
writing this report I have heard
nothing from the Pentagon. Assum-
ing there is no reason for further
secrecy, I will give this information
now:

We observed two Russian sub-
marines which were mapping the
floor of the ocean in order to build
missile bases from which they could
fire missiles to any part of the world,

ladies have been very in-
terested in them because it would
solve their cooking and dishwashing
problems. I do not know what the
space people ate.

While we were sleeping the craft
hovered in space about six or seven
miles above the earth. I inquired
whether this wasn't dangerous as
another ship or a meteorite might
strike us. They assured me that there
was no danger for they use an automatic pilot during such times, and
it another ship came within range
it would avoid the ship we were on.

My bed was similar to the one to
which I am accustomed, with a mattress and made up with sheets, pillows and blankets. The ship was always warm and remained at a constant temperature. I do not know
where the heat and light came from,
but it was light all of the time. Even
when we were beneath the surface
of the water the light glowed from
the ship for a distance of three or
four hundred feet or more.

I had to get a new battery for my
1958 Buick, for the old one was completely dead the second day after
my return. When it was tested at the
garage they found nothing but pure
water in it. I also found, during my
earlier contacts, as described in Part
I of this book, that each time I was
stopped by the spacecraft, the battery in my 1955 Buick boiled dry.
One time the top of the battery was
completely blown off as if a great
pressure had been exerted below it,
and a black tar-like substance had
spread over the top.

This concludes the report of my
contacts with the people from the
Planet Saturn up to the present
time. However, I shall be watching
for I am sure they will keep their
promise to return again soon.

The Saturnian Visitors

Tuesday evening while the nation was still wondering about the flying eggs in New Mexico and the invisible UFOs that buzzed the Sorgaso, welcome comic relief appeared. A man named Schmidt, a grain buyer, announced that during the afternoon he had visited with the crew of a flying saucer that had landed to make repairs.

While driving in the country near Kearney, Nebraska, he said, he had noticed a bright flash about a quarter of a mile away. Going closer to investigate, he perceived a huge silvery ship a hundred feet long, thirty feet wide, and fourteen feet high, which had landed in a dry river bed. The motor of his car then died. He got out and was walking toward the ship when a light shot out and paralyzed him. The ship opened and two men emerged. After searching him for concealed weapons, they released him from paralysis and invited him into the ship, where he spent half an hour chatting with these strangers and their female companions, mostly in High German and English. (He knew that they came from outer space but not until some weeks later, when they paid him a second visit, did he discover that they were natives of the planet Saturn.) [14] After he left the ship it rose straight up into the sky and disappeared, while he hurried back to town to report to the sheriff, to broadcast an account of his experience over the local radio, and to give his story to the newspapers.

It is perhaps a measure of the panic level that week that local officials actually examined the ground at the "landing" site, looking for evidence. They found none. The four "hydraulic rams" that allegedly supported the huge machine had left no imprint on the sand of the dry river bed. Traces of oil found on the ground were tested chemically and proved to be the same brand that the witness carried in the trunk of his car.

Gaining national notoriety from this incident, Schmidt soon became a popular lecturer at flying-saucer clubs, thrilling the audience with tales of later visits from the Saturnians and his journeys in their spaceship to the Arctic Circle, through the waters under the North Pole, and even into outer space. A year or so later his extraterrestrial friends allegedly tipped him off to the location of certain valuable minerals on earth, including veins of quartz that had the desirable property of curing cancer. To mine this quartz and thus make it available to humanity, he enlisted the sympathy and financial aid of a number of lonely, wealthy widows. Some of these ladies eventually came to believe that they had been the victims of fraud, and, in 1961, a California jury agreed with them. The Saturnians apparently have not yet reappeared to help their friend out of his difficulties.

Saucer Visitor
Is Ex-Convict

By UNITED PRESS

Authorities in Kearney, Neb., today held a "heart to heart" talk with a salesman, later discovered to be an ex-convict who claimed he chatted with four men and two women in a transparent "space ship".

The report by Reinhold O. Schmidt, 48, of Bakersfield, Cal., last night was the most dramatic of the host of unidentified flying object sightings reported around the country.

SCHMIDT'S TALE, as authorities science-fiction element to contend with for a time. Police roped off the spot where the "watching" allegedly took place and examined various impressions and stains on the ground.

But curiosity turned to skepticism when Steve Warrick revealed that Stevens & Warrick, a former newspaper publisher, now a former convict Neb., was a former convict who had served time in the Nebraska penitentiary for embezzlement.

However, Schmidt stuck by his story. Police said they held a "heart talk" with Schmidt last night and planned further questioning today.

Elsewhere, strange "sightings" sent Air Force pilots scrambling to investigate, kept police busy and brought hundreds of persons to police stations.

Stores of sightings in the Midwest last night apparently centered in Illinois and the planet Venus, police were told. So easily explained.

The Coast Guard reported picking up reports.

Gulf of Mexico south of New Orleans. A Coast Guard officer said the object paused over the cutter Sebago in the Gulf for a time.

MILITARY police and motorists said they saw a bright object hovering near the U. S. grounds at White Sands, N. M. They said the object killed the engines on their cars.

A "red ball" was sighted by three persons last night over the Atomic Energy Commission's plant near Augusta, Ga. The plant executive editor of the Augusta Chronicle said, Louis Harris, said "object appeared to be a flying saucer."

Flying lights over northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin night spurred police and military authorities into a frenzy of investigations.

Two persons in northern Illinois said the object appeared to be a "bright light" went out when an object appeared in the sky. They said the Air Force Base in Mattoon, Ill., and O'Hara Field investigated and later reported the object was a star.

A man in Saginaw, Mich., said he saw a bright light. Authorities said he apparently saw a star. Military authorities apparently gave credence to it.

said he saw an object which
made car engine stall near
the Sands Proving Grounds.

COL. JOHN McCURDY, Air
Force public relations officer at
White Sands, said the engineer, James Stokes, 42, will
be given a thorough medical
examination and a radiation
count test. McCurdy said he
was "personally satisfied" with
Mr. Stokes' report.

Also in the Southwest, a
civil service worker at Lackland Air Force Base in San
Antonio, Tex., said he saw an
object about 200 feet long, hovering about 200 yards from
him as he drove near the city.

Lon Yarborough said his car
engine and lights went off, and
the object took off in a few
minutes, catching him to drive
away.

At about the same time, the
Ground Observer Corps at Midland, Tex., reported a disc-shaped object and picked up conversation on a sound detector.

The conversation was unintelligible.

Long Beach, Cal., three
Air Force weather observers,
one of them the commanding
officer of the local weather
late yesterday reported an unidentified, saucer-shaped flying object over Long Beach Air Force Base.

What's Going
On Up There?
MIAMI, Nov. 6 (UP)—
Amateur Radio operator John
Petroff says Russia's Sputnik
II satellite sounds like thousands of insects and birds
chirping aboard a speeding
train.

Petroff picked up the satellite on his high frequency
set and recorded the sound
on tape.

The noise of the satellite reminded him of the "rickety-clackety" clack of a train—
there was even a high whistle
coupled with the noise of

edly seen by 10 military personnel who were waiting to
board a plane, according to
the spotting unit.

First to sight the objects,
together as flying at an altitude of about 1,000 feet at the
base of clouds, was commanding officer Maj. Louis F. Baker,
accompanied by Capt. Joseph
and William Nieland, weather
observers, also said they saw
the objects.

Maj. Abramavage, who made
the report, said the objects
were "circular in shape and
shiny like spun aluminum,
changing course instantaneously without loss of speed
like planes in a mock dogfight."

color. "When it just disappears. As to the time, it must have been shortly after
two o'clock when I saw the flash. Then I got out of the ship it was about three o'clock.
It must have taken off about three o'clock."

FURTHER INTERVIEWING: SOURCE was interviewed for two (2) hours, resulting in the
following amplification to his story:

1. The flash of light drawing his attention initially was similar to an electrical short, yellowish in color, and did not blind the SOURCE. SOURCE was approximately
one-half (½) mile from the scene.

2. SOURCE did not attempt to check his automobile for battery failure, such as
horn, lights or radio.

3. SOURCE was approximately thirty (30) feet from the object when the paralyzing light hit him. The light, coming in a color described as a thin, not blinding or hurting him of his senses other than movement, seemed to come from a two (2) inch diameter
source on the end of the object and lasted for two (2) or three (3) seconds. Paralysis
lasted for approximately ten (10) seconds.

4. Searching of the SOURCE by the two (2) men was simply "patting" operation.
His pockets were not searched nor did the SOURCE touch any people at any time.

5. The four (4) men, about 5'8" tall, dark complexion, were dressed in ordinary
street suits. Each appeared to be dressed in different shades of brown and blues, brown shoes, hats with narrow brims, and full length ties with rubberized insignia. One (1) man wore a small mustache (similar type). The two (2) women wore dressed in
white blouses and brown skirts, wore lipstick, had shortly cut brown hair, wore distinctive calfskin, chain necklace with a pendant in the center. All appeared to be between forty-five (45) and fifty (50) years of age.

6. The men spoke to SOURCE in broken English, but conversed with each other in
their own language which SOURCE understood was probably Russian.

7. Entrance to the object was by retracting stairway of four (4) steps. The
door opened and closed automatically and without visible control.

8. The interior was about forty (40) feet long. Instruments mounted on aluminum
stands line the sides of the interior. SOURCE was unable to describe exactly any
instrumentation except to say that a variety of circular and linear dials of various
sizes were noticed. Both Roman numerals and ordinary numbers were not on the dials.

9. SOURCE stated that the interior of the object was lighted from an invisible
source. No noise other than the very talking was heard. It was possible to see
through the sides, bottom and floor of the object, being completely transparent. It
was not possible to see through the ends of the object or to see anything showing the
mechanisms presumed to provide propulsion. A lounge consisting of a steel metal and
brown upholstery was located in the cabin area near the rear of the room.

10. A two-way conveyor apparatus ran the length of the room (40 feet). SOURCE
observed the crew stepping on the conveyor and being transported at about "walking
speed", stepping off at the conveyor at any point along its length. SOURCE stated, however, that no rotating parts were noted. Leading him to speculation that some "mechanism
was driving the conveyor". The two (2) women and three (3) men were working on
the conveyor, handling the dials. The remainder were not present. The view was
from the instruments through a tube into the end section of the object.

Contacts With Space People

Glossing quickly over the most documented sightings, the AF concentrated on one case the explorers felt they could thoroughly discredit. They had were just as much in other ones the perfect setup; a man who claimed he had been inside a space ship and talked to the occupants. The man in the street tended to discount so-called "contact" stories. And as soon as it had been learned that the man had a prison record, the anti-saucer elements began to have a field day. To cap it off they had the witness put in the booby hatch, but apparently were able to hold him there only a few days.

You've probably heard much of the Kearney Nebr., case. Reinhold Schmidt, grain dealer of California, said he had come upon a huge object just resting in a river bed. At first he thought it was a huge balloon—but instead of reporting what was in the papers, let FLYING SAUCERS bring you the next best thing to hearing a taped interview with Schmidt. Thanks to a friend who broadcasts a flying saucer radio program, and Gene Larson, news director of Station KGFW, Kearney, Nebr., we publish his interview verbatim, as it went out over the air:

LARSON: This is Gene Larson, news director of Radio Station KGFW, in Kearney, Nebraska. At the present time on this Tuesday evening, Nov. 5, 1957. we are at our studio. The time is central standard time, 7:20. At our side at microphone we have a Mr. Reinhold O. Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt has stated that his home address in Bakersvillle, California, is 715 Case St., and that he is employed by Value-Pak, Inc. They are in the Walnecka, Neb., feed and grain concentrates. Their office is 501 West Main St., at Brawley, California. Mr. Schmidt, this afternoon, would you have something to occur to you, and you talked a little bit about it. We would like to ask you a series of questions. The information that I have given so far, Mr. Schmidt, is that correct?

SCHMIDT: Yes.

LARSON: In other words you work for Value-Pak, Inc., you live in Bakersvillle—you are in Kearney.

CHASING THE FLYING SAUCERS                29

Nebraska for what purpose?
SCHMIDT: Buying grain.

LARSON: Is this your first trip
to Kearney?
SCHMIDT: Yes.

LARSON: And by buying grain,
what do you mean, sir?
SCHMIDT: Buying for the farmers or elevators.

LARSON: And you travel around
the country, sir?
SCHMIDT: Yes.

LARSON: And you drive what
kind of a car, sir?
SCHMIDT: A '55 Buick Super.

LARSON: Now this afternoon I
believe you were out south of town
—about how far, sir?
SCHMIDT: About four miles.

LARSON: About what time was
this?
SCHMIDT: Between 2:00 and 3:00
in the afternoon.

LARSON: In what direction and
which direction?
SCHMIDT: I was going south, and
then turned east on the Newark
highway.

LARSON: You noticed something
in the Platt River bed, am I right,
that it was dry—?
SCHMIDT: There was a flash
there—what I first noticed.

LARSON: And that was how far
from the road, sir?
SCHMIDT: About, half a mile. I
would say.

LARSON: Did you continue to
drive, or did you immediately stop?
SCHMIDT: No, I drove on up a
little closer to where the flash was,
to see what caused it, and when I
got so close I found out—I thought
it was a balloon that had crashed
there.

LARSON: Then you drove closer to
the object?
SCHMIDT: Yes.

LARSON: And then what occurred?
SCHMIDT: When I got within 60

feet of the object my car stopped.
The motor went dead. I tried to step
on the starter, but there was no response whatsoever. I got out of the
car. I figured the terminal had just
broken loose on the battery. I got
out of the car and walked toward
this balloon—or what I thought was
a balloon—and when I got within 30
feet of it, a light shot out and, I
wouldn't say it paralyzed me, I
would say it hypnotized me
(Schmidt's voice shows confusion as
to the exact effect of the ray—G.B.).

LARSON: You couldn't move?
SCHMIDT: I couldn't move.
LARSON: Could you think?
SCHMIDT: Yes, I could think and
talk, but I couldn't move.

LARSON: Before we go into further happenings in regard to this
object, wonder if you could describe
it. About how long was it, sir?
SCHMIDT: It was about a hundred feet long, as near as we could
step it off, and 30 feet wide, and I
judge it was 14 feet high.

LARSON: What did it appear to be
made of?
SCHMIDT: Real bright aluminum.

LARSON: Now this was in the bed
of the Platt River, which is dry at
the present time? It was sandy
there?
SCHMIDT: Yes.

LARSON: It appeared to be of
aluminum, bright and shiny. And
you got out and you approached
this object. Did you notice anything
as to how it would move? Did there
appear to be pipes, or propellers, or
what was it?
SCHMIDT: On each end of the
machine there was a tube running
up and down, and in these tubes I
could see big fans. It seemed like
that did the propelling.

LARSON: How close did you get
to this object?
SCHMIDT: I got to it and in it.

LARSON: I understand that, sir.

but before you got into it, you got
out of your car, even across the
field toward the river bed. How close
to the object did you get before you
noticed anybody?
LARSON: About 30 feet.
SCHMIDT: Then what occurred?
LARSON: There was when that light
shot out and—
SCHMIDT: Paralyzed you, as far
as you know. Then what occurred?
LARSON: Two men came out
and they said not to be alarmed, that
they would have to search me—
LARSON: They came out of the
side?
SCHMIDT: Yes, out of the side of
the machine.
LARSON: And were there steps
down to the ground?
SCHMIDT: Yes, there was a slid-
ing door, and then the steps.
LARSON: I see. They came out
and they spoke to you in English?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: How were they dressed?
SCHMIDT: They were dressed like
any American would be. In busi-
ness suits.*
LARSON: Did they appear to be
young, or middle-aged, or—
SCHMIDT: They were middle-
aged, I would say between 40 and
43.
LARSON: And they spoke good
English?
SCHMIDT: No, they spoke a bro-
ken English.
LARSON: What did they say to
you?
SCHMIDT: They told me not to
be alarmed, that they were not go-
ing to hurt me, and they did want
to search me, and I told them I
had no weapons. I asked them
what the "deal" was, what this ob-
ject was, and they told, as I am
long as we can't leave for a few

minutes, you can come in and look
around.
LARSON: So you went up the steps
with them? And entered the object?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: Did you sense anything
by way of smell, that was out of the
ordinary?
SCHMIDT: No; at all.
LARSON: Were there any other
people in this object?
SCHMIDT: Yes, there were four
men, and two ladies.
LARSON: Ladies? What age did
they appear to be?
SCHMIDT: They appeared to be
around 40.
LARSON: Were they talking when
you entered?
SCHMIDT: They just spoke to me,
that's all. They just said "Hello."
LARSON: In what language?
SCHMIDT: In American language.
LARSON: They said, "Hello," and
you answered them?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And what did you see,
once you were inside this object?
SCHMIDT: Well, there was just a
lot of instruments, and wires, and it
seemed like they were working on
these wires, for some reason. The
girls were at another instrument
there with a lot of dials and push-
buttons.
LARSON: After these women and
these other men said hello to you,
one of them, more than likely, stay-
ed by you—?
SCHMIDT: One man, all the time.
LARSON: And he was the one who
talked to you?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And the two women and
the other three men went about
their business? Did they appear
be interested, in you after saying
hello?
SCHMIDT: No.
LARSON: Then did they talk
among themselves?

*Schmidt doesn't say whether they were black or not—G.B.

SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And what language were they using?
SCHMIDT: They were talking in a high German, as much as I could tell—that machine was about a hundred feet long, as I've said, and they were talking in a high German every time I could hear them.
LARSON: Are you qualified to know high German, Mr. Schmidt?
SCHMIDT: Yes.

LARSON: And they didn't appear to be interested in you personally, after you said hello?
SCHMIDT: No.

LARSON: And now you were in the object about how long, Mr. Schmidt?
SCHMIDT: I would say about 30 minutes.

LARSON: What did you do while you were in there?
SCHMIDT: I was just talking to this man, although he didn't explain anything to me.
LARSON: You asked him questions?
SCHMIDT: Yes, I asked him some more about what they were doing, and he said he couldn't tell me that, but in the near future we might all know. He said—to tell my people that they meant no harm.

LARSON: And then did something occur that would indicate to you that perhaps the machine was repaired?
SCHMIDT: Yes, this one man who was working on one end, he said they would be ready to take off—in German language.
LARSON: And you recognized it?
SCHMIDT: Yes.

LARSON: Still high German?
SCHMIDT: Yes. And then this man told me, in American, that they were ready to take off and that I would have to leave. I went out of the machine, the door closed, the ladder went up and I stepped back about ten feet—they didn't tell me to watch out or anything—and when the machine started going, why, I stepped back a little farther. And then I watched them leave.

LARSON: How did they leave?
SCHMIDT: It went straight up in the air. Slowly at first, then it gained speed, until it got about 150 to 200 feet in the air. It seemed like there was a flash there, and it just disappeared.

LARSON: Now, you could see any object of this size feet in the air?
SCHMIDT: Oh, yes. It just disappeared. It changed color.

LARSON: Did they have any instructions to you after you left?
SCHMIDT: They told me not to try and start the automobile "until after we leave, for it won't start anyway." Then he kinda smiled, and that's when I first knew they had done something to the automobile.

LARSON: Did you personally feel they were very friendly toward you as a person?
SCHMIDT: Yes, very friendly.
LARSON: But disinterested in you as a person?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: May I ask you this, now, Mr. Smith? You were with them, or near them, for about how long a time?
SCHMIDT: I would say 30 to 35 minutes. It took about five minutes to come out there and get me and bring me back.

LARSON: And after it vanished, up there in the sky, you decided to do what, sir?
SCHMIDT: I went to my automobile, and started to the Sheriff's office.

LARSON: Let me ask you this: Were you scared?
SCHMIDT: Not at that time I

wasn't so much, until that beam hit me. At first I thought it was just a balloon which had crashed there.

LARSON: And you came up here and talked to the Buffalo County Sheriff, Lloyd Frank, was that right?

SCHMIDT: His deputy.

LARSON: And then what occurred?

SCHMIDT: The sheriff and myself, we went out there, and he was convinced that something had been there. Then we came back and got the city manager—

LARSON: That's Ray Lundy, yes—

SCHMIDT: The chief of police—

LARSON: That's Thurston Nelson?

SCHMIDT: That's right.

LARSON: And all of you returned to the scene then. And was there any evidence left at the scene that would indicate that this had occurred?

SCHMIDT: Yes. The sheriff, I think it was, and myself, we picked up some leaves there that had some, to me though it was hydraulic oil or something like that—it had a peculiar smell to it. It was a greenish color.

LARSON: Were there marks on the ground?

SCHMIDT: It seemed like this one—we could see where this one had hit the ground.

LARSON: I see. Were there footprints, where these men had walked?

SCHMIDT: Yes, it was sandy. There were footprints there.

LARSON: And you explained to them what had actually happened, and they were convinced that some of this had occurred, if not all, actually?

SCHMIDT: Yes.

LARSON: What are your personal feelings, Mr. Schmidt, about this? Did you have a chance yet to calm down enough to really get at it?

SCHMIDT: I really haven't so far, but I don't know whether there is such a thing as outer space—or a machine from outer space—or it might be from a different country.

LARSON: You feel it might be either one of the two?

SCHMIDT: Yes.

LARSON: What race would you say they were?

SCHMIDT: German.

LARSON: Well we want to thank you very much, Mr. Schmidt, for this opportunity of talking with you. We appreciate it very much. You are very definitely going to be interrogated by the various law enforcement bodies. There will be news media after you. We appreciate this chance to talk to you first hand about this. Do you have anything else you would like to say at this time?

SCHMIDT: No, I guess that's all that I have to say.

LARSON: Thank you very much, Mr. Reinhold O. Schmidt, of Bakerville, California. This is Gene Larson, News Director of Station KGFW, in Kearney, Nebraska.

THE KEARNEY, NEBRASKA "CONTACT" CLAIM

This story was unusual in that it told of a "contact" with saucer pilots who might be no "spacemen" at all, but ordinary human beings from somewhere on earth, presumably East Germany or Russia. It was important in that it received very wide publicity, and so could be suspected as the possible inspiration of seemingly similar stories told immediately afterwards, such as Everett Clark's of Dante, Tenn. As we write this, we must admit that we don't yet feel absolutely certain of the truth or falsity of any of these stories—even Schmidt's, on the basis of the information now available, might just possibly be true. Since this case is undoubtedly one of interest to our readers, we give below a summary extracted from the Kearney Hub and other dozen wire-service clipping from various newspapers.

The teller of the story, Reinhold Schmidt, 48, a grain buyer from Bakersfield, Calif., drove into Deputy Sheriff Dave Drage's office late on the afternoon of Nov. 5th, "white-faced and acting to see a minister." He said that his car engine had died when he drove to within twenty yards of a silvery limp-shaped object 100 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 14 feet high, with a vertical blue containing a large fan as each end, which was standing on four posts. As he got out and approached it, a stainless-like ramp came out, and two middle-aged men emerged, something like a flashlight at him, which seemed to paralyze him temporarily. One flashed something like a fan toward him. The men had four weapons, and one said: "We'll have to be here a little while—you might as well come inside." From inside, the walls appeared transparent. There were two more men and two not-so-young women, all dark-haired and dressed in ordinary clothes. Engaged in revising some "wiring, Arron Eisenberg (?) spoke what Schmidt called "High German." To move to aid from certain sections of the ship, the crew "about" spoke in an incomprehensible way. In perhaps half an hour, but was not given an information about it—only a warning. The incident was, in a most precise way, told to the Hub reporter by Schmidt into the day. After it vanished, he found he could start his car.

Schmidt told Kearney police Chief Marston Nelson to a nearby place's tank of the Platte River, where were found the footprints of two men approaching a third of the tree trucks united then suddenly came to an end, as if they had stepped off the ground. The police also found splashes of a green, oily fluid (INS said, apparently incorrectly, that four holes in the ground had been found.)

Late on the night of the 5th-6th, Long John played a tape of Schmidt telling his story. It was straightforward, self-possessed, and quite devoid of suspiciously subjective features—far more convincing-sounding, for example, than Menzer Schmidt's, equally, Donald Keyhoe told a Vela-Pak, called him quiet, reliable, a non-drinker, and "not the type to fabricate something." However, he had known him for only about six weeks.

By morning on the 6th, the UP had found out that Schmidt had served time in the Nebraska penitentiary in 1938-39 for embezzlement. And the Hub and the AP reported that an empty can of green motor oil had been found near the spot where the "saucer oil" was found, and "another can of the same type of oil was found in the trunk of Schmidt's car." Schmidt had been held all night at the county jail and grilled, being permitted little sleep (Law officers questioned Schmidt throughout the night—Hub).

By afternoon, an INS dispatch reported that two Air Force investigators from Colorado Springs were also participating in the questioning of Schmidt, who had been "interviewed through most of the night but stuck to his story." And that the county, at his request, had assigned him a lawyer. It disclosed also two facts that never appeared in the Hub that he had refused to take a lie-detector test, and that Scottsbluff County sheriff Steve Warrick said he had known Schmidt for years, and described him as a "mixed-up boy."

On the morning of the 7th County Attorney Kenneth Gotched "filed a mental-illness complaint" against Schmidt after an "extensive examination" by two psychiatrists preceding evening. Gotched said that Schmidt "according to the doctors he 'greatly desires recognition and publicity'" (Hub and AP). If found sane, however, he would be free to go his own way; government officials "discouraged filing charges in such cases, for fear that other persons might refuse to report significant events"(UP).

A hearing by the county board of mental health was held the same evening, 7:30-9:45 p.m. The examining psychiatrists advised that Schmidt was "very ill" (AF) and in unmedical need of psychiatric treatment "(UP), and was committed to the State Hospital "for an indefinite period."

The UP story also reported that "Authorities said they had received information from his family that Schmidt was suffering from sending 'inabilities,' and demands on him from unidentified persons and 'crackpots.'" This last phrase suggests paranoid delusions. However, we find from the Hub that it was not Schmidt himself, but the Kearney police, who had complained of "an increasing demand on the part of unidentified persons" for interviews by minor officials.

What happened to Schmidt was publicized by nearly every paper in the country, and the Air Force was obviously happy to give the incident a "none of the only five worthy to be investigated." Regardless of what the true facts are in the Schmidt case, it is an example that will certainly tend to discourage future witnesses or future landings from reporting their experiences.

We must assume that the psychiatrists were justified in their verdict; it seems impossible to take seriously the idea that they would be partly to any "reasoning" conspiracy, or that they were unable to distinguish nervous strain from insanity. But the extraordinary speed of the commitment, the participation of the Air Force, and the fact that no conclusive proof of Schmidt's insanity was made public, are bound to arouse a great deal of suspicion in the saucer world. We are glad to say that Jules St. Germain (CSIS legal advisor) intends to look into the legal aspects of the case. We hope that his findings and comment can appear in the next News Letter.
