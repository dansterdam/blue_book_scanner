SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORT:

1. SOURCE was taken to the scene of the sighting; he could show the spots of the effect had rested were visible because the object had never fully landed. while SOURCE stated that the base of the object was about twelve feet above the ground, four new uses and a large object more than had been shown by marks on the ground above the place uv distances of fifteen and two respect objective and the point below where the fan of the object was located. The greenish oil covered the leaves and it was of the object...66 blades and some are struck by falling in certain areas of the soil oil was nearby, and it was possible to obtain a sample from scales mainly on the leaves. A quart oil can was found about 30 feet from the location of the soil spot. The Quart 10 van that was identical to an unnamed can found in the trunk of the SOURCE'S (un read the lack of anomalies or new ones marks on the leaves. The oil sample was sent to the university of Nebraska for analysis i. Results of this analysis are not yet available.

2. A farmer, H. was driving his truck about 2 eight from the scene at approximately the time of the incident when his rotor stopped. A highway mechanic was allowed and replaced the points in the distributor. The mechanic stated to investigators that he had replaced a broken rotor in the former's truck about 10 days before the incident and stated that a piece of the broken rotor had not been removed at that time.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. SOURCE was δ asked to indicate when fifteen seconds had elapsed. He es-
timed the time arier Coxi five seconds hod elapsed. SOURCE estimated 1,00-yard~
to be equivalent to 1500 feet. SOURCE estimate of the width of the underst
was accurate.

. Investigators arrive to interview the SOURCE after he had been subject
to al-night questioning by city officials and newsmen. The SOURCE thus had ample
time to firmly establish in his mind time answers no practically all questions which
the investigators could conceivably ask. The above facts notwithstanding, that
SO’.JRCES ready answers to all questions, particularly those which concerned minute
details, detracted rather than lent authenticity to his story. SC TG ilate: to
training in observation which would have allowed him to re! Cen such fato as
style of necklace the women were wearing. SOURCE admitted difficulty in different—
entwisting blues, grays and brown-, and although he stated his vision wo: W-20,
he wore glasses.

3. The facts that no supporting physical evidence (othen thay the ail spat
which is viewed with sus1pici ) could be derived; his record own his toe
detailed account of the incident; and hi eft lead the prepsr-
officer to conclude that the incident has no basis in fact, and that the SOURCi
suffered a hallucination as evidenced from the investigators! observations that
7! actually came to believe that he had witnessed the object.

TECHNICAL REPORT OFFICE BUILDING
OMAHA
NOVEMBER 5, 1957

Colonel Kenneth W. King
United States Air Force
Detachment 105
Office of Special Investigations
Offutt Air Force Base
Omaha, Nebraska

Dear Colonel King:

This is to confirm telephonic advices on change in status concerning an alleged landing of a vehicle in the vicinity of Kearney, Nebraska. November 5, 1957, concerning which our Resident Agents, Joseph H. Daring, as Greets Island, Nebraska, by Chief of Police, Thurston Nelson, advised us.

On November 5, 1957, a local citizen, as the report states, stated that on the afternoon of November 5, 1957, he was driving along a country road approximately 15 miles west of Kearney, Nebraska, when he saw a peculiar object on the ground. He stopped his car and approached the object, which he described as appearing to be about 30 feet in diameter and about 12 feet high, with a dome on top. He stated that it appeared to be made of a metallic material and seemed to have a reddish glow.  

The citizen further stated that as he approached the object, he heard a humming sound and saw a bright light flash from the object. At this time, he stated, he became frightened and hurried back to his car and drove away. He said he did not turn his car around and did not see the object again. He said he lost no time in reporting the incident to the Chief of Police in Kearney.

short distance and near the river saw what he thought was a Navy balloon. He said he walked toward the balloon, which appeared silver in color, 100 feet long, 30 feet wide, 12 feet high, standing on four legs, and as he neared the balloon two men alighted from the balloon and directed a ray at him. He said this ray appeared to came from a flashlight-like instrument and it made him camspletely rigid, physically although he could still here, see and think. He said these two men then searched him and asked him aboard the balloon. He said they let him enter a door of the balloon and stand just within.
Mr. ------ said within the balloon were two more men and two women. The four men were dressed in conventional dress suits and the women in dresses. He said the two men who met him outside were the only ones of the six individuals who talked to him in English. He said these two spoke perfect English and told him, "Tell your people we mean no harm. We have been sighted before in the United States but you are the first person to come aboard."
told Nelson he asked them where they were from and where they were going and they told him they could not answer his questions but in the near future he and everyone else would know about them.
told Nelson the two women aboard the balloon maintained positions near the instrument panels and spoke what he described as high German, which he said he understood. He said the women spoke only to each other and then only of the instruments. He stated rather than walk they would slide from instrument panel to panel. He said all six passengers appeared to be 35 to 40 years of age and human. He said suddenly one of the men told him they had to leave and he had to alight from the balloon. He said he got out of the balloon and it immediately took off in a vertical direction. He said after it had risen about 100 feet in the air It blended into the sky and he could see no trace of it.
stated there was a door at either end of the balloon. He said when inside its walls were completely transparent and he could see the surrounding countryside clearly.

Chief of police Helson stated he and Captain Roberts of the air police saw what they considered to be an unidentified flying object about 12 miles south of Kearney on November 6, 1957. He stated it was observed for over 20 minutes and did not conform to any known aircraft. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and made abrupt changes in direction. Helson stated he has reported this to the military authorities.

California, police departments have advised my office they have had numerous reports of "unidentified flying objects" in the Kearney, Colorado area. This is in Kearney police chief Helson's mile radius. Reports indicate these objects are seen frequently by military and civilian personnel in the area.

For your information, at 8:00 p.m., November 6, 1957, this office was contacted by a Mr. Helson, chief of police, Kearney, Nebraska, who stated that he and Captain Roberts of the Kearney Air Police had observed an unidentified flying object about 12 miles south of Kearney, Nebraska, at approximately 7:00 p.m. the same date. He stated the object was observed for over 20 minutes and did not conform to any known aircraft. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and made abrupt changes in direction. Mr. Helson stated he had reported this to the military authorities.

This information is furnished to you in the event any further information on the subject.

Very truly yours,

Re:
Dear Sir:

Pursuant to our telephone conversation of yesterday,
March 5, 1958, this is a follow-up of information that I have
which might be helpful to you in anyway which you night desire
to use it. Enclosed you will a of the type of handbill
that was circulated around Kearney, Nebraska on the 5th of March,
advertising the lectures and also you will find enclosed a mimeo-
graphed sheet which was handed out to persons who attended said
lecture. A person who attended this lecture reported to me that
there were only between 25 and 30 persons who attended the lec-
ture. Whether or not there will be a larger crowd this evening,
of course, I cannot forecast. There was no advance notice through
any of the new media that this program would be in town, so if the
purpose was to make a money making venture out of this, it was
poorly handled. The observer who reported to me concerning the
meeting commented that there was much talk by Mr. (title) and Mr.
Also that the authorities, the Air Force, were doing everything
they could to keep this information from the public, there was
also a comment according to his observer that the Air Force In-
vestigators attempted to have Mr. (name) change his story. Of
course, I know that is not the fact since I was present when Mr.
(name) was being interrogated, and I know that you only attempted
to take down everything he had to say.

My observer reports that Mr. (name) related at the
lecture that he had another contact with this same saucer ship
and the same occupants, on the 5th of February, 1958 near Elm
Creek, Nebraska, a few miles West of here. He supposedly took
a ride in it this time.

I am also enclosing in this letter a report
provided to me by the psychiatrist. As I recall, you asked me to
furnish you such a report.

I doubt that this is all particular interest, however,
it is forwarded to you in the outside chance that it may be of
value.

Sincerely,
Kenneth S. Gotobed

```
KEARNEY, NEBRASKA "SPACE SHIP" INCIDENT
5 November 1957

On the morning of 5 November 1957, the Air Force received a UFO
report, which, within a few hours had drawn nation-wide attention, and was
given some prominance by both the press and television. According to
(unofficial) reports, a space ship had landed on U.S. soil, was observed
by a man name who was driving nearby, and who, upon stopping
to investigate was invited into the space ship by its crew.

According to a seed salesman, a flash of light from
the ship stopped his car. It came from a nearby river bed, on which rested
an object that he thought was a balloon. When he approached it, another
flash of light came out of the space ship which paralyze momentarily,
making him incapable of walking.

a. Two men came out and asked him if he was armed and then
searched him. After the search, he was able to move and walk again, and he
asked them what the ship was, and what they were doing. They said they
couldn't tell him. He asked to see it closer and they said that as long as they
couldn't leave for a few minutes, he might as well look at it. They started
back to the ship and as they got close, a door opened on the left side. When
he got into the ship he noticed that there were four men and two women. They
all spoke to him in German.

ALAMOGORDO, N. M., July 29-- (IP)-- Dr. Carl
Jung, Swiss psychologist, says in a report that Unidenti-
fied Flying Objects are real and “shown signs of intelli-
gent guidance by quasi-human pilots.”

“I can only say for certain
that things are not a mere
rumor, something has been
seen,” Jung said in the re-
port released yesterday. “A
purely psychological explana-
tion is ruled out." 

Jung, who started his research
on UFO's in 1944, released his
report through the UFO filter
center of the aerial phenomena
research organization here. It
was released by J. L. Lorenzen,
Holloman Air Force base.

“I have gathered a mass of
observations on unidentified fly-
ing objects since 1944,” Jung said. 

“THE DISCS do not behave
in accordance with physical
laws, but as thought without
weight ... 

“If the extra-terrestrial origin
of this phenomenon should be
confirmed this would prove the
existence oi an intelligent
inter-planetary relationship.
What such a fact might mean
for humanity cannot be pre-
dicted.

“But it would put us without
doubt in the extremely pre-
carious position of primitive
communities in conflict with
the superior culture of the
whites ... 

“That the construction of
these machines proves a scien-
title technique immensely su-
perior to ours cannot be
argued."

WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP BREAK THROUGH THE SECRECY ON THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OR FLYING SAUCERS

It is known that Radar Reports and other data on UFO's (Unidentified Flying Objects) or Flying Saucers is under the wraps of secrecy in the military. All information is collected but the public is kept in the dark on this vital subject. What information is released is distorted and misleading. Why should this be so, asks the alert, intelligent american who prays THE NOB for all of this. There is a rising demand for the Citizens RIGHT TO KNOW about all of the hidden facts and rightly so. A Constitutional Democrcy cannot endure without an informed electorate.
                        THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO
1. Write intelligent letters to YOUR STATE SENATORS & CONGRESSMEN -- also your UNITED STATES SENATORS & CONGRESSMEN. Ask for a free flow of information on this subject. Ask them to act as your elected Representatives in this matter to see to certain that this information reaches the public.
2. Tell them about local interests, local sightings of UFO’S, photos, Clubs & activities.
3. Ask that a civilian board be appointed to collect this information and give it to the public. Let the people evaluate these reports and this information. It belongs to the people.
4. Ask for an investigation by: the Armed Services Committee -- Sen. Richard B. Russell, Ga., Chairman. Senate Committee on Gov't Operations, Sen. John L. McClellan, Ark., Ch. House Committee on Gov't Operations, Congressman John E. Moss, Chairman. Govt Appropriations, Sen. Carl Hayden, Ariz., Chairman. (Senate) Gov’t Appropriations, Sen. Clarence Cannon, Ho., Chairman (House)

If the right committee for the job (Intercpnsarency Study) does not exist, ask that immediate steps be taken to accomplish this. MAJOR WINGER S. HILL Washington 8aucer Intelligence, P.0. Box 815, Washington 4,D.C. has been going to Senators, office and evory Congressman’s office on this subject, and is continuing his work on Capitol Hill, until results are obtained. He has been told by government officials in the Sonata and House that there is NO COMMITTEE IN EXISTENCE that's qualified for this specific assignment. Interplanetary Research is unique and new to our time. It is time for action to correct this weakness. How else can we enter the Age of Space 7
5. It is time for us to face the issue squarely. The time has come for fortnight answers. Let us end the doubletalk and evasion.
6. Request a REPLY

If America is to enter the SPACE AGE with honor, let us face up to the responsibilities of the Space Age. Let us -- rather than attempt to conquer space -- begin to UNDERSTAND Spece. With this approach -- we too can become SPACE Travelers

Here are two forms to address your letters: 
For a Senator: Honorable Charles E. Potier United States Senate, Washington 25, D.C. 

For a Congressman: Honorable Gerald R.Ford, Jr House of Representatives, Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sir - or Dear Senator Potter ________ Very truly yours, 
Dear Sir - or Dear Mr. Ford __________ Very truly yours.

This is how YOU can help in bringing about many wonderful events. 
Now let us hear from you.

SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL CLUBS, ACTIVITIES, PUBLICATIONS

KEARNEY, NEBRASKA "SPACE SHIP" INCIDENT
5 November 1957

b. The space ship was described as approximately 100 feet long, 15 feet high, and 30 feet wide and rested on metal supports or "pads".

c. ________ stated that the interior was about forty feet long. Instruments mounted on aluminum stands lined the sides of the interior. He was unable to describe exactly any instrumentation except to say that a variety of circular and linear dials of various sizes were noticed. Both Roman numerals and ordinary numbers were noted on the dials. ________ stated that the interior of the object was lighted from an invisible source. No noise other than the crew talking was heard. It was possible to see through the sides, bottom and floor of the object, being perfectly transparent.

d. After 25 or 30 minutes they bid ________ goodbye and asked him to leave., The ship suddenly rose above the tree tops and sped off in a Southwesterly direction, without a sound being made. 

________ was taken to the scene of the sighting by Air Force Investigators. No marks where the struts of the object had rested were visible because the area had been walked over by newsmen. While he had stated that the body of the object was about three feet from the ground, many dry weeds and some scrub trees of four or five feet high were unbroken in the location where the object rested. He was unable to provide a reason for this.

Ya, Das Was Eine Grosse Space Ship by the United Press.

A traveler in- Nebraska says he saw and talked last night with the ordinary-appearing occupants of an apparent space ship.
Reinhold O. Schmidt, 48, of Bakersfield, Calif., came into Kearney, Nebr., white faced and shaken and asked to see a minister.

He told of talking with six "occupants" of a transparent space ship," parked for repairs outside town, and stuck to the story through repeated questioning by authorities.

Many other sightings of unidentified flying objects were attributed by scientists to tricks of vision in persons who actually saw the brightest planet - Venus and other stars. The associate director of Harvard University's observatory, Dr. Donald A. Menzel, said many seeming "flying saucers" were due to mirage causes and that scientists who had been shown some sighters appeared to deny all such explanations.

In Kearney, Mr. Schmidt, a grain buyer who once served a prison term for embezzlement, said he had been inside the ship with its four men and two woman passengers who appeared to be ordinary mortals in ordinary clothes. They spoke to each other in German and to him in English, Mr. Schmidt said.

'Zooming Up'
An ex-convict's story of a chat with "spacemen" was reported by the Indianapolis Star on November 7, 1957. The article states that the ex-convict claimed to have encountered "spacemen" who were "friendly" and said his car battery went dead Wednesday and he looked for help. The article also mentions other reports of strange sky objects, including one from a man in California who claimed to have seen a large white vapor trail shooting from the ground to the sky.

Kearney, Nebraska “space ship” incident; 5 November 1957.(classified)
a. On the morning of 5 November 1957, the Air Force began its investigation of the UFO report, which, within a few hours had aroused nation-wide attention, and was given some prominence by both the press and television. According to (unofficial) reports, a space ship had landed on U. S. soil, was observed by an unnamed man who was driving nearby, and who, upon stopping to investigate was invited into the space ship by its crew. 

b. According to unnamed sources a seed dealer driving car, when a final light which stopped his car came from a nearby river bed, on which rested an object that he thought was a balloon. When he approached it, another flashed light came out of the space ship which paralyzed him momentarily, making him incapable of walking. 

c. Two men came out and asked him if he was armed and then searched him. After the search, he was able to move and walk again and asked them what the ship was, and what they were doing? They said they couldn’t tell him. He asked to get a closer and they said that as long as they couldn’t leave for a few minutes, he might as well look at it. They moved back to the ship and as they came near it a door open on the left side. When he got into the ship he noticed an interior were four men and two women. They all spoke to him in German. 

d. The space ship was/described as a ovoidal! a———, 100 feet long, 15 feet high and 30 feet wide and rested on four metal supports or “pads.”

e. (Name), stated that the interior was about forty feet long. Instruments mounted on aluminum stands lined the sides of the interior. He was unable to describe exactly any instrumentation except to say that a variety of circular and linear dials of various sizes were noted. Both Roman numerals and ordinary numbers were noted on the dials. (Name) stated that the interior of the object was lighted from an invisible source. No noise other than the crew talking was heard. It was said to be completely open on the sides, bottom and floor of the object, being perfectly transparent. 

f. After 25 or 30 minutes they bid goodbye and sped off in a Southwesterly direction, without a sound being made. 

g. (Name) was interviewed by both local authorities and Government investigators; and was later taken to the scene of the sighting by Air Force investigators. No marks where the struts of the object had rested were visible because the area had been walked over by newsmen. While he stated that the body of the object was less than three feet from the ground, many dry weed and scrub trees of four or five feet high were unbroken or undisturbed In the location where the object rested. He was unable to provide a reason for this. 

h. A spot of oil about 24 inches in diameter was found on the ground below where the fans of the object was located. The greenish oil covered the dry leaves and it was possible to obtain a sample from pools made on the leaves. A quart oil can was found about 30 feet from the location of the oil spot. The Texdol 10-30 weight can was identical to an unopened one found in the (name) vehicles.

NEW CONTACTS
Flying Saucer 'Rider' Lands in Prison Cell
Reinhold O. Schmidt, 63-year-old window in Bakersfield, Calif, who claimed he had contact with a flying saucer and its crew, is now serving a 1-10 year prison sentence for grand theft, it was announced here. Schmidt, considered by authorities to be mentally deranged, was convicted in Bakersfield of obtaining $3,000 from a woman by persuading her he was going to use it to finance a trip in a flying saucer to the planet Venus. Schmidt previously had been sentenced to 1-10 years in a state prison on a charge of grand theft. Upon completing this sentence, he was returned to Kern County to face the new charge.

Schmidt also claimed that he had talked with the occupants of a flying saucer which landed near Bakersfield on Nov. 20, 1957. He said he had been taken aboard the craft and shown maps of the earth and other planets. Schmidt said the occupants told him events would happen before they occurred. He was awaiting trial on this charge when he was sentenced on the grand theft conviction.

UPON-A AIC-CIGAR-SHAPED SPACE *?=,HN IN THE NEBRASKA PRAIRIE AND CHATTED
WITH THE FOUR MEN AND TWO WOMEN INSIDE IT.
       REINHOLD SCHMIDT, 48, A GRAIN DEALER FROM BAKERSFIELD, CALIF., SAID
THE INHABITANTS OF THE "WAITINK" SPOKE IN ENGLISH AND GERMAN AND
TOLD HIM "IN TIME YOU WILL FIND OUT WHAT WE ARE DOING."
       AFTER 30 MINUTES OF PLEASANT CONVERSATION, SCHMIDT SAID, HE GOT OUT
OF THE FLYING MACHINE AND IT ROSE SILENTLY UPWARD, "LIKE A HELICOPTER."
       AN FBI AGENT FROM GRAND ISLAND, NEB., WAS DISPATCHED TO KEARNEY
TO INVESTIGATE THE STORY.
       POLICE CHIEF THURSTON NELSON MEANWHILE BACKED UP SOME DETAILS OF
THE CLAIM.
       HE SAID HE FOUND THE FOOTPRINTS OF TWO MEN APPROACHING A SINGLE
SET OF FOOTPRINTS, PRESUMABLY (i) IN A SANDY EXPANSE OUTSIDE
KEARNEY.
       THE THREE FOOTPRINTS THEN ADVANCED TOGETHER AND SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED,
AS IF THEY HAD BEEN YANKED UPWARDS, NELSON SAID.
       POLICE SAID THEY ALSO FOUND A GREENISH, GREASE-LIKE FLUID ABOUT THE
AREA WHERE SCHMIDT SAID HE VISITED WITH THE "WAITINK" INHABITANTS.
       SCHMIDT DROVE INTO KEARNEY LATE TODAY, WHITE-FACED AND ASKING TO
SEE A MINISTER.
       HE SAID HE WAS DRIVING NEAR KEARNEY IN SOUTH-CENTRAL NEBRASKA
ON A GRAIN-BUYING EXPEDITION WHEN HE SPOTTED A SILVERY OBJECT WHICH
LOOKED LIKE"A NAVY BLIMP."
       "I GOT WITHIN 60 FEET OF IT AND MY CAR STOPPED," HE SAID. "I GOT
OUT AND WALKED CLOSER. IT WAS 100 FEET LONG, 30 FEET WIDE, AND 14
FEET HIGH, AND STANDING ON FOUR POSTS.
       "AS I APPROACHED, A RAMP LIKE A STAIRCASE CAME OUT. TWO MEN
EMERGED AND ONE FLASHED SOMETHING AT ME LIKE A FLASHLIGHT. FOR
SECONDS I COULDN'T MOVE. THEN ONE SAID "WE'LL HAVE TO BE HERE A
LITTLE WHILE—YOU MAY AS WELL COME INSIDE."
       HE ENTERED THE CONTRAPTION, SCHMIDT SAID, AND FOUND TWO MORE MEN
AND TWO WOMEN. THEY SEARCHED HIM AND SPOKE WITH A GERMAN ACCENT, HE
SAID. SCHMIDT SAID THE WOMEN WERE BRUNETTES, ALL OF THEM WERE
DRESSED IN EVERYDAY CLOTHES, AND TWO OF THE MEN WERE MUSTACHES.
       THE WALLS OF THE BLIMP, WERE TRANSPARENT FROM INSIDE, SCHMIDT SAID.
THE WOMEN APPEARED TO BE WORKING ON THE SHIP'S WIRING AND ALL THE
PASSENGERS SEEMED TO MOVE ABOUT THE SHIP ON A CONVEYOR OR MAGNETIC
FIELD, HE SAID.
       "THEY TOLD ME TO (i) LOOK AROUND BUT THEY WOULDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE SHIP," ((((( SAID. "ALL THEY WOULD SAY IS 'TELL THE

FLYING SAUCERS     OCT 57

The
KEARNEY
INCIDENT
By
Reinhold O. Schmidt

There has been so much controversy regard- ing the strange adventure of Richard O. Schmidt in contacting a flying saucer which eventually took him for a ride that we have asked him for his own story. Here it is...

My name is Reinhold O. Schmidt. I am a grain buyer from California. On October 25, 1957, I was transferred from Arizona to Kearney, Nebraska, by my employer, a firm of Brawley, Cali- fornia. At other times of the year I work for another company in Los Angeles, California. In leaving Arizona, I left a foreman in charge of my corn picking and shelling operations at WILLCOX, Arizona. I was using three Minneapolis-Moline picker shellers there which I had purchased on contract.

The afternoon of November 5, a dark and misty day, I was inspect- ing some fields of milo and corn that I had bought, and some that I planned to buy. I was four miles south, and a mile east of Kearney, when I turned to the left on a river road to inspect a large field of milo. After looking it over, at about 2:30 P.M., I drove to an abandoned farm home to turn around. Just as I was about to turn into the drive, I no- ticed a large bright flash about a quarter of a mile ahead of me. I fig- ured somebody was blasting trees although I heard no report - and instead of turning around I decided to drive ahead and see what was going on.

I drove toward the river bank and when I was within approximately 100 feet of it, my car stopped. I turned the switch off and on several times, and stepped on the starter, but it was completely dead. I won- dered if the rough road had jiggled some of the wires loose. When I looked up I saw what appeared to me to be a large half-inflated bal- loon. I got out of the car and walk- ed toward it; coming around a clump of willows and tail grass I got a bet- ter look at it, and I realized it wasn't a balloon, but a large silvery ship of some kind of metal that looked

KEARNEY, NEBRASKA "SPACE SHIP" INCIDENT
5 November 1957

A spot of oil about 24 inches in diameter was found on the ground below
where the object was located. The greenish oil covered the dry leaves
and it was possible to obtain a sample from pools made on the leaves.
A Veedol quart-oil can was found about 30 feet from the location of the
oil spot. The Veedol 10-30 can was identical to an unopened can found
in the trunk of car. A beer-type can opener found in his car
made identical opening marks as on the can found at the scene.

hours, who found that was definitely

like polished steel or aluminium.
When I was about 30 feet from the ship a pencil-like stream of 
light shot out from the ship and hit me across my upper chest. I don't 
know whether I was scared stiff or
paralyzed by the ray of light, but 
anyway I couldn't walk or move my 
arms. Then a door slid open in the 
ship and two men cane out toward 
me. They asked if I was armed; I 
said "No," but they frisked me anyway. However, they didn't take any-
thing from me. By this time I could 
move again. I asked them what they 
were doing there, what kind of ship 
this was, and where they were from. 
They said they couldn't tell me that
at this time. I asked if I could come 
closer to see the ship. They said,
"Yes," for they couldn't leave for 
a few minutes anyway, and I was 
invited to come aboard. Inside, the 
leader said I could look around, but 
not to touch anything.
From the outside, this ship ap-
peared to be a solid piece of metal 
without portholes or windows. The 
only opening I could see was the 
doorway we entered. Inside, it was 
entirely different; the walls looked 
more like glass, and I judged them 
to be a foot thick, but you could look 
right through them! You could look 
up and see the sky, look down and 
see the weeds and brush - look out 
and see the trees and the entire 
countryside!
There were four men and two la-
dies inside the ship. The men were 
dressed in street clothes, approxi-
mately 5'8" tall, weighing about 170 
pounds; the two ladies appeared to 
be about the same height, weighing 
about 120 - 130 pounds, and I guess-
ed their ages to be about forty. Their 
complexions were rather dark, about 
like a sun tan. The ladies were bru-
nettes and wore light colored blouses 
and dark skirts, and medium heeled 
shoes. 

The two ladies sat behind a large
desk at one end of the ship all the
while I was inside. On the center
of their desk was a large instrument 
which looked like a TV set. Also at
this end of the ship there were four
columns of colored liquid - red, 
green, blue and orange. These tubes 
were approximately feet high 
and 6 inches in diameter. The liquid
was slowly moving up and down like 
pistons in an automobile. The girls 
seemed to be watching these tubes 
very closely.
The other three men worked on 
the instrument panel. This panel 
covered one side of the large center
room and seemed to be filled with 
clocks, dials, buttons and switches. 
In the center of the panel was an-
other large screen of some sort. It,
too, looked much like our TV screen,
but it was not operating while I was 
there. I saw one of the men clip off 
some short wires. I looked over the 
panel for identification of the in-
struments. I thought I might be able 
to see where they had been manu-
factured. There was no lettering of
any kind either on the inside or the
outside of the ship, but I did see
some regular and Roman numerals
on the instrument panel.
Later, I estimated that this large 
room in the center of the ship must 
have been about 50 feet long and 30 
feet wide and about 14 feet high. At 
each end of the ship were rooms ap-
proximately 25 feet long which I
was not permitted to enter. But 
when I looked down at the ship from 
the river bank and up at it when it 
took off, I could see a large tube
about 12 feet in diameter in each 
end of the ship. In each of these 
tubes was a large 8 to 10 bladed fan. 
What these fans were used for, I
don't know; I didn't notice any
breeze or dust caused by them on
the takeoff.
Another thing about the ship that

scientists, I decided to go to the
minister of my faith and tell him
about it and ask him what to do.
He wasn’t in. Then I drove over to
the police station and asked them
if they had seen the sheriff. The
sheriff was out of the office all at-
ternoon, they said, but the deputy sher-
iff was at the courthouse. They call-
ed him and made an appointment
for me to meet him there. I went
to the courthouse and told the de-
puty what had happened that after-
noon.
The deputy was the first person to
hear of my experience. He said,
“Let’s get out there.” We got into
his car, and started out. On the way
he said, “This is quite a coincidence.
Did you hear the siren blow at noon
today?”
“Yes,” I said, “I was in my room
at the hotel at the time and I
thought it was a fire.”
“No,” he said, “someone called and
reported a strange object or ship in
the sky moving toward Kearney.”
When we got to the scene of the
ship’s landing we could see the im-
print of the four hydraulic rams on
the dry bed of the Platt River. Also,
toward one end of the spot where
the ship stood we found some oil on
the sand and leaves. It was dark
green in color, fine in texture and
sweet smelling, but where it really
came from, I do not know.
I suggested to the deputy that we
rope off this area and get some
guards out there. But he wanted to
go back to town and get some of the
other officials and see what they
said. We went back to Kearney and
reported to the chief of police about
my experience and what we had
seen. Then the chief wanted to go
out there and he asked the city at-
torney to go along. We also picked
up a reporter from the local news-
paper. There were five of us then,
on this second trip - and we drove
out in the police car with the siren
going all the way.
Everybody saw the imprints and
the oil in the sand and they all a-
greed that there had been a large
object of some kind setting there.
The deputy and I stepped off the
distance between the imprints in
the sand and we estimated the ship
to be 100 feet long and 30 feet wide;
and I estimated it was about 14 feet
high.
I again asked if they didn’t think
it a good idea to rope off this area
and call someone in authority and
report the ship. They said it wouldn’t
be necessary as there were five wit-
nesses here and they were convinced
that a large ship had landed here.
We gathered some of the greenish
oil in a small mustard glass we
found on the river bank. The chief
of police said he would have it test-
ed. We drove back to town and they
left me off at the Fort Kearney Ho-
tel where I was staying.
I felt I had done my citizen’s duty
in reporting the ship and now I was
through. I sat down in the lobby
and was watching TV when the local
program was cut off for a special
news flash—
“SPACESHIPS LAND AT KEARNEY,
          NEBRASKA”
This was put on the air without
my knowledge or permission. In fact,
I had not even called the object a
spaceship as I did not know what it
was.
About thirty minutes later the
phone began to ring and everybody—
reporters, photographers, citizens,
etc.—wanted more information. The
chief of police then called me and
asked me if I would come over and
help answer the telephones as he
too was swamped with calls. I went
over to the police station and the
chief turned his office over to me
with two phones. I answered those
two phones and the chief took calls

THE KEARNEY INCIDENT               33

fascinated me was the way the occupants would glide instead of walk across the floor when they stepped back from the instrument panels! Although it worked like an escalator, I couldn't see anything move, and when I tried it, it didn't work for me. I wondered if they had something special on their shoes. 

All of the occupants of the ship greeted me and bid me farewell on leaving, they said, "We will see you again." (Little did I realize that they meant what they said!)  Other than that, the one man did all the talking. And by the way, this man looked and talked just like a man that was watching TV with me in the hotel lobby the night before. On the ship he said, "Tell your people we know that they have seen this ship before and they will see it again." 

He also asked me if I knew anything about the U.S. satellite program. I said I did not. Then he said, "Yes, they're planning to send some up, but the first two will never leave the ground and the third one will go up, but won't send back much data." 

This prophecy has since proved itself.

They all spoke to me in the English language with what seemed to me to be a German accent. Among themselves they talked high German which I could understand as I graduated from a school where they spoke and taught German as well as English, and I was able to speak, read and write German at that time. I can still understand it and speak it fairly well.

After being inside the ship about 30 minutes, one man said to the other, "Wir sind fertig.” Translated, this means, "We are finished." So the leader told me, "You will have to leave now." I was glad to hear this, for I wondered if I would ever get off that ship again. 

When I stepped off the stairs onto the ground the motor started. It sounded like a large electrical motor to me, and the more momentum it picked up, the quieter it got. It ran for about twelve seconds and then the ship took off straight up into the air. Approximately twelve feet off the ground the entire ship turned a pitch black; when it was about one hundred feet in the air it turned to a bluish green. Then it headed southwest - there was a brilliant flash - and the ship disappeared before my very eyes! I estimated the ceiling of the clouds that day to be only about eight hundred feet, but the ship disappeared long before it hit the ceiling - I judged at about one hundred fifty feet from the ground. It was reported to me later by a county official that it had stalled a tractor, two cars and a large truck that were beneath its path.

While aboard the ship I was told not to start my car until they were out of sight as it wouldn't start anyway. This was the first time I knew that the ship had stopped my automobile. After the ship disappeared (about 3:15 P.M.) I went back to my car - now it started - I turned it around and started for Kearney.

Then the impact of the experience really hit me, and I was so shaken I had to stop the car and pull myself together.

I debated whether to report my experience or not. I was afraid if the report of the ship got out, people wouldn't believe it and I might lose my job. Then I remembered hearing over radio and TV that the government wanted skywatchers and that they were to report any unidentified objects in the skies. I realized then it was really my duty as a citizen to report the ship. In fact, my own idea at the time was that this was a Russian ship manned by German

their oil did not smell; Later, I discovered some of the oil had been poured out in the trunk of my car and over my laundry. I ask you, what man would leave a half-full can of oil standing in the trunk of his car?

Although it was reported to me that the two Air Force officials from Colorado Springs, Colorado, arrived in Kearney during the night, they did not meet or talk to me until about 11 a.m. the following morning (November 6). Then they asked me to tell them of my experience and they recorded it on tape.

While in this session, one of the local officials from Kearney wondered out loud how the ship could go straight up. Forgetting himself, one of the Air Force officials said, “Oh, we know what makes it go straight up.”

In the meantime, local officials went back on the air and TV and denounced my experience as a hoax.

Once I was confined to the jail I was cut off from all phone calls and contacts. My employer placed a person-to-person call to me for three days that was never completed.

The next day (November 7) there was talk about a mental hearing. I was asked to get to a telephone: I wanted to call my brothers and have them bring one of their attorneys. The officials wouldn’t permit me to use the phone.

“We have good attorneys here in Kearney,” they said. And running through the list of attorneys in the ‘phone book, “Here’s a good fellow.”

They called him and when he arrived I saw he was the assistant city attorney.

The first thing he said was, “We don’t believe your story, and we want you to change it.”

“Well, I have news for you,” I said. “I don’t want you for my attorney.”

But the next day it was announced in the local paper that I had an attorney of my choice.

About 11 o’clock at night then (November 7), I was called to a meeting of a mental hearing board. Members of the board were:
The chief of police
The county attorney
The clerk of the district court
The deputy sheriff
A doctor

This meeting was held behind locked doors in an upstairs room above the fire department. A local radio announcer knew the meeting was to be held and was trying to locate it—he inquired all around town until he finally found out from a local cop, too late to attend the meeting.

When the doctor arrived he asked me just three questions:
1. “How do you feel about the people of Kearney, Nebraska?”
I said I had no hard feelings toward anyone.
2. “Do you still maintain that you saw that ship?”
“I certainly do.”
3. “Are you willing to go to the mental hospital and have some mental tests?”
“No,” and I further answered that I did not intend to go to the hospital, and if they insisted on taking me they would have to pay the bill.

In about fifteen minutes I was on the way to the hospital at Hastings, Nebraska, accompanied by the chief of police, the county attorney and the deputy sheriff. On the way up the fellows kidded me about having pretty nurses and a nice rest.

“Well, fellows,” I said, “You can have your fun now, I’ll have mine later on.”

I was admitted to the hospital that night.

Before the hearing, however, one of the local officials called my broth

in the outer office.
This went on for approximately sixteen hours with photographers and newsmen coming in from surrounding cities - and even other states. At 9 P.M. the chief of police and I appeared on a local radio station. At 10 P.M. we appeared on a local TV station. These programs were released on national networks.
There was a school bond election that night in Kearney. Some folks said the excitement was started to spoil the election. Nevertheless, the bond issue carried.
So many reporters and other interested folks flocked to the city that there was a traffic jam for blocks around the police station. Within the police station there was standing room only. The last trip I made to the site of the landing that night was 3 A.M. Even at that time there were about thirty cars out there and a crowd of people milling around.
The activity continued all night long until between 5 and 6 A.M., when the officials changed their story and suggested that I change mine too. I told them they could change their story if they wished, but I wouldn’t change my story unless it was for the security of the United States. This they couldn’t prove, so I stayed with it. Then they asked me if I would take a lie- detector test.
“Not now,” I said, “I’ve been talking for sixteen hours, but I will after I have had a few hours’ rest.”
By that time I was hoarse from talking; I had been under the photographers’ lights for about fifteen or sixteen hours. I told the officials I was going back to my hotel room then and go to bed. But the chief of police said I couldn’t do this for they were going to hold me.
“For what reason?” I asked.
They didn’t know, they said, but they were just going to hold me, and they did.
So I went to bed in jail. When I got up a few hours later I asked them if they wanted me to take the lie detector test. They said it wasn’t necessary. Later I was advised that I was right in refusing to take the test when I was in a state of hunger, fatigue and strain. But I will still take the test if the officials of Kearney will take it with me.
About 10 A.M. that morning (November 6), the county attorney brought in two oil cans to me and he said they had found some evidence and I might just as well change my story. He said the empty can was found within a few feet of where the ship was supposed to have stood. The other partly filed can, he said, was of the same lot number and was found in the trunk of my car with the can opener beside it.
I told him he would have to think up a faster one than that. Either he couldn’t see, or I couldn’t see, or all the officials of Kearney couldn’t see, or about five or six hundred other people who had walked up and down the river bed all afternoon and night couldn’t see. For the oil can was supposed to have been found just that morning - within a few feet of where the ship had been standing. I suggested they take the fingerprints off the cans they found, but to my knowledge, they did not.
The cans they showed me had circular holes in them. The can opener I had in the car cut a triangular hole. The two cans of oil in question’ were of the Veedol brand. I still have the two cans of oil in my car that I had been carrying with me then - one is of the RPM brand and the other Skelly. A local radio announcer told me later on that the Veedol Co. had announced that they sold 5,000 or more cans of oil a day and they wanted the public to know

THE KEARNEY INCIDENT

\my boss vouched for my sanity and stability, and my other employer from Los Angeles sent a letter in the form of an affidavit to the 
hospital vouching for my business judgment and honesty. They stated :
had bought thousands of dollars of 
grain for them and they never had 
any occasion to doubt my ability or 
character.

I was released from the hospital 
that day.

On the whole, my stay at the hos- 
pital was quite pleasant. I had a 
private room, and I got along swell 
with the doctors and nurses. Except 
for one psychiatrist.

“I’m going to ask you a series of 
questions,” he said, “and I want you 
to answer what the first thing that 
comes to your mind, whether it an- 
swers the question or not."  
The first question was, “Who was 
smarter, George Washington or 
Abraham Lincoln” 
“l don't know,” I replied “I wasn't 
even born then." 
The next question: “If you weren't 
a human being, what would you 
rather be?”
“I’d rather be a psychiatrist!”
With that he slammed his book 
shut.

I asked if that was all the ques- 
tions. 
“Yes,” he said. “In court our rec- 
ord doesn’t stand up anyway.” 

Back in Kearney, I said to my 
boss, “Well, do I still have a job?”
"You certainly do,'' he said. "I 
made a little investigation here in 
Kearney myself for three days before 
I came to the hospital and all the 
people I talked to were behind you."

So he suggested we put an ad in 
the local paper stating I was back 
in Kearney buying grain again. The 
ad ran as follows:

               **ATTENTION** 
            **MILO AND CORN GROWERS**
That crazy grain buyer from Cali
-
-
-
fornia is still around and would 
like to bid on your grain. Will pick 
it up at your farm in twenty long 
trucks 
Call me at the Fort Kearney Hotel. 
Reinhold O. Schmidt, Brawley, 
California.”

The paper came out that after- 
noon, and by evening I had a stream 
of phone calls from farmers offer 
Ing to sell their grain to me. If I 
could have managed the transporta- 
tion of it I could have bought thou 
sands of tons of grain that night.
I bought grain around Kearney for
three months after that and, on 
February 5, I was looking over a 
field about twenty miles west of 
Kearney near Elm Creek.

I was driving along a country road 
about fifty miles per hour when 
suddenly my car stopped with a 
braking effect. (I was driving the 
same car as before - a 1955 Buick 
Super). The same ship hovered down 
beside me inside the fence of a 
meadow! I thought to myself, “Well,
here it goes again!”

I got out of the car and was walk-
ing toward the fence when another 
car drove by with a man and a wom-
man and a little child in it. I waved 
at them to stop, hoping to have 
some witnesses, but they hurried by 
even though they looked right at me.

I don't know whether they saw the 
ship or not. By the time I climbed 
the fence, the door of the ship slid 
open and the same man who talked 
to me on the first contact asked
me if I would do them a favor. 

I told them I would be glad to if 
I was at all possible. Then they in-
vited me into the ship and asked me 
if I would care to take a little ride-
as it would cause too much commot-
tion for them to remain beside the
road

The ship rose straight up into the 
air, and when approximately 150 to 
200 feet up, the man turned to me

THE KEARNEY INCIDENT
This time I said nothing about my experience in Kearney, Nebraska, where I had met a flying saucer. Major Wayne Aho, of Washington D.C. used his influence to arrange telephone conversations and correspondence in a matter of 3 days later, however, in Detriot, he was no longer interested. Ranged to meet in Davenport, Iowa, on February 15. A school of my reports was published in the U.S. Air Force Regulations, that from the time I joined Major Aho the next night, I joined Major Aho in the rest of the Midwest tour, and we were in Kearney, Nebraska.
The "saucer" was seen for a few minutes that evening and we tried to determine their movements. Those fellows were in Kearney, Nebraska were watching the western sky. At about 8:30 P.M. the evening following, a team in my apartment, and we had an engaging conversation, The local minister with whom we had visited that afternoon said that he felt that there is something in the western sky unusual for the region, it was very low and there above the setting sun we could see what appeared to be a comet or star, but it seemed fixed in the western sky, a portion of the star appeared to be emitting a dim, steady glow, but as I watched, something developed - the object moved and dipped and showed a cone-like structure later, the object which became quite brilliant before fading with the setting sun.
Looking at the western sky again one of the group called, "there comes another one," Two minutes later, however, there was neither an object nor vapor trail to be seen in the left side of the western sky. This time, however, we watched, and we could see a jet looking more closely we could see it was flying with a trailing vapor stream across the sky for several minutes, the object emitted a scintillating light that moved along with it.
According to the traveling salesman who came to the lecture that night later told us that when the display in the dining room of the hotel we reported the "show" that had been described to us. 'Well, they're having a lecture on scintillating thoughts, that must have been what you saw.'
It was reported to us that the world did they get them so high up in the air and staying called the Lowry Air Force Base in Colorado and was informed that was a national.

and said, "If any of your friends are
watching you now, they will not be
able to see you."
    But I could still see the entire
countryside. I asked them while in 
flight what powered their ship -
what kind of gas did they use?
    "We get our power from the sun
and from the earth." I was told.
    Inside the ship it was like sitting
in your living room. As far as sen­
sation was concerned, their ship
wasn't any, either in flight or in the
ascent or descent.
    The ship landed on the dry river
bed again among the leaves. Inci­
dentally, both times the ship landed
on what`is called accretion land.
That is land that cannot be sold or
owned privately, only leased by the
owner of the adjoining land. At one
time this land was part of the river
bottom covered with water. Then the
river channel was deeper and nar­
rowed by man, and this part of the
river bed grew up in grass and brush
and trees. I have since wondered if
they purposely chose this land so
that. they would not be trespassing
on private property. Also, it may be
interesting to note that Kearney
is located on Highway 30, in the mid­
dle of the United States from east
to west. At a point just outside of
Kearney it is 1733 miles to San
Francisco and 1733 miles to Boston.
  The favor they wanted of me was
the answers to three questions:
  1. What would the United States
do if other planets were to set off
atomic bombs and to start Sputniks
and other satellites flying around
which would affect the earth and
interrupt its radio and TV operations
and other devices?
  2. What was the plane carrying
that disintegrated over the Pacific
on the way from San Francisco to
Honolulu besides passengers?
  3. How would your people react if a
fleet of these ships would land on a
friendly mission? Would they accep[
us on friendly terms?
  I promised to try to get the ans­
wers, and if they would give me
their address, I said I would gladly
forward this information to them.
The spokesman smiled and said,
"We will contact you again."
  Then I asked, "How did you know
I was on this road, or do you pick up
just anybody?"
  "No," he answered, and then he
said, "Your people have fingerprints
for identification; we have your
brain impulses and can pick you up
at any time."
  Then I suggested I might be in
California by the time I got the ans­
wers for them.
  "That doesn't make any differ­
ence," he said. "We can pick you up
any place, any time."
  And when I left the ship, they
said, "Goodbye, we'll see you again."
  Although they asked me no ques­
tions the first time we met, they
seemed to know all about me, and
this second time they greeted me by
my first name, Reinhold. I told them
about all the trouble I had re­
porting their first visit.
  "Yes, we knew about it," I was
told, "and we were standing by. If
they hadn't released you from the
hospital by a certain time we would
have put on a mass demonstration
over Kearney and made ourselves
known."
  When we were back at my car and
I was about to leave they said, "We
have stopped your car twice now,
and if we stop it a third time your
battery will be dead.”
  Both times my battery boiled dry.
I have a twelve-volt battery with a
three-year guarantee. It is a little
over a year old. The black top coat­
ing of this battery has holes blown
in it from the excess presure when
they stopped the car. The second

42 THE KEARNEY INCIDENT

"San Francisco, Cal, (AP)—The Pan American Strato-cruiser Romanace of the Skies was carrying shipments of chemicals and ‘radio- active’ materials when it crashed in the Pacific, killing all 44 persons aboard, a Civil Aeronautic Board hearing was told Wednesday.

"The huge airliner, bound from San Francisco to Honolulu mysteriously plunged into the ocean about midway between the two points last November 8. Only 19 bodies were recovered.

"The first witness before the sev- en-man hearing panel was David L. Thompson, Santa Monica, Cal., head of the team of CAB investigators who have spent the last two months seeking clues from the wreckage.

"Mr. Thompson said one thing certain was that the plane had burned after it struck water.

"Mr. Thompson said the plane carried a shipment of ‘yellow label sodium sulfite restricted cargo pack- ed’ in accordance with ICC regula- tions.'

"In addition, he said, there was ‘White label radioactive material’ aboard the plane.

"Mr. Thompson offered no solu- tion to one of the prime mysteries of the tragedy - the riddle of why the crewmen were unable to send a distress message in the 23 minutes from the time it last gave a position to the time it struck water."

I cannot say that this information is the complete answer to that question. Nevertheless, it gives us something to think about, and I wonder if that wasn't the real pur- pose of their questions anyway. As to the other two questions, that is something for each of us to answer for ourselves too.

As a friend of mine says, "A good teacher asks the students questions to make them think."

During the latter part of April,

1958, I attended a meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. After the meeting a group of us were sitting in the hotel coffee shop when one of the space people came in and asked us out- side the hotel, and we drove out toward the spot where the spacecraft had landed. We went approximately six miles down the highway, then turned off the pavement onto a country road. Almost immediately a beam of light shot out from the ship, which was sitting nearby, and the driver of the car then followed the beam, went up onto the ramp, and we were soon inside the ship.

I remained inside the craft with the space people for about two hours, during which they told me several things which I do not yet have per- mission to reveal to the public.

I spent a part of the month of June buying grain in Nebraska and Colorado. While in Denver I was again contacted. This time they asked me if I would like to go with them to the Arctic Circle some time in Au- gust. I answered that I would drop all my work in order to go with them. I then asked why they had chosen the Arctic Circle. They replied, Let's just say for an educa- tional purpose."

On August 14, 1958, while in my Hollywood apartment, one of the space men came again. He said they were ready to leave for the Arctic Circle and if I was ready they would take off that evening. I told them I would have to make a few telephone calls first, and asked where they wished to pick me up. They instruct- ed me to drive down to my quarry (I have a rock quarry on Highway
6, about forty miles north of Mo- have).

The region around the quarry is rather desolate and I suggested that I would put my car in a garage as I did not wish to leave it there. They said, "No, take your car and drive

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
LOG DATE: 7 nov 57
LOG NO.: 33-0-57
LOCATION: Kearney, Nebraska
AGE: 59
OCCUPATION: Grain buyer for Valleydale Incorporated, Taylor, California. 
EDUCATION: Grade School, High School, one (1) year Kearney Normal College.
QUALIFICATIONS: No particular training in technical subject or in aircraft.
SUMMARY: The witness sighted an unidentified object on 29 October 1957, at about 4:30 p.m. CST, while walking along the road. The object came from the north and passed overhead, traveling south at a very high rate of speed. The witness described the object as circular in shape and able to change direction sharply. It was visible for about 60 seconds and appeared to be approximately 500 to 600 feet in diameter. The witness stated that COORD. was in the area and is in need of data on this sighting.
SOURCES DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: 
The witness was walking along the road north to inspect a field of milo (sorghum) when he noticed an object coming from the north to the south, checking the milo as the road was too narrow to pass directly beneath the object. The object appeared circular in shape and was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, an estimated 500 to 600 miles per hour. The object was able to make sharp turns without loss of speed or control and was visible for approximately 60 seconds. The witness stated the object was estimated to be 500 to 600 feet in diameter. The object was silver in color and had no visible means of propulsion. After passing overhead, it made a sharp turn and sped off to the south, disappearing from view behind a hill. The witness has had no technical training in aircraft and is not qualified to recognize or identify aircraft as to type or design.

  The remark is often made, "How 
come there are no witnesses to a 
space ship landing?"
  I don't know that I can answer 
that fully, but in the case of my 
experience of November 5, I under-
stand there may be a number of 
witnesses for there were hunters and 
construction workers in the vicinity. 
In fact, a local radio announcer in 
Kearney allegedly has a tape record-
ing of two business men in Kearney 
who testified that they heard a ser-
ies of sounds while pheasant hunt-
ing the afternoon of my contact, 
that they believed came from the 
ship. This same announcer checked 
with the Lowry Air Force Base and 
learned that they had no aircraft 
aloft the afternoon of November 5 
between 1:00 and 6:00 P.M. due to 
the low ceiling and hazardous flying 
conditions.
  Also, many folks are wondering 
why the occupants of the ship spoke 
German. Again, I don't really know. 
But oddly enough, when my boss 
came to Kearney to see me after my 
release from the hospital he had 
with him a business associate from 
Mexico – a man who was very much 
interested in my experience. After 
I finished telling him about it he 
told me that he had encountered a 
similar ship in Mexico! It, too, was 
occupied by four men and two wom-
en - only they talked in Spanish! 
You will have to draw your own con-
clusions.
  Another thing I am often asked is, 
"Did you ever read any books on 
flying saucers before your experi-
ence, or were you interested in the 
subject?"
  I had heard something about fly-
ing saucers, as everyone has over 
the years, from reports in news-
papers, etc. But I had never paid 
any particular attention to the sub-
ject. As I have often said, "I didn't 
believe, I didn't disbelieve but they 
certainly made a believer out of 
me!" As to books, I hadn't read any 
on the subject before my experience, 
and I haven't read any since either.
  Now I'm going to conclude my re-
port, as of April 5, 1958, when I re-
ceived some information from
NICAP (National Investigations
Committee for Aerial Phenomena) 
regarding one of the questions the 
visitors asked me. (What was the 
plane carrying that went down, the 
besides passengers?) NICAP sent me 
a couple of Western newspaper 
articles which I am copying for 
your information. The first is a 
story from the Des Moines Register, 
dated November 9, 1957:
  "A large Stratocruiser, enroute be-
ween San Francisco and Honolulu, 
is reported missing after having 
sighted mysterious blinking lights 
in the sky early this morning. The 
last position given by the plane was 
about 900-1000 miles northeast of 
Honolulu. A military transport fly-
ing near the area reported sighting 
similar mystery lights, blinking off 
and on, 120 miles north of the last 
reported position of the Stratocruis-
er after it had been reported miss-
ing. A full scale sea and air search 
is in operation with aircraft hoping to 
find the plane carrying a crew of 4 
and 36 passengers in the event it 
might have plunged into the sea."
  (Note: Later reports said #4 a- 
board.)
  Was there a suggestion that space-
ships (mysterious blinking lights) 
might have caused the accident, I 
wondered, and was that why my 
spaceship friends wanted me to find
out what else that ship was carrying 
besides passengers?
  Then another news clipping, an AP 
article, published January 16, 1958, 
in the Omaha World Herald, gave 
the following information:
    "Radio-Active Cargo Fell--Mystery 
    of Plane's Crash Unsolved

THE KEARNEY INCIDENT

ing. The space people told me our Government knows about this activity because three of our submarines are located there, and one of our blimps and some of our larger planes have flown over that area.

The space people told me they will not permit this to happen. They stated that if we can't stop the Russians from attacking the world from beneath the water, without sound and without warning, they themselves will stop them. I am sure they mean this. They also said they wouldn't permit an atomic war. They made it clear that they are impartial and are not "taking sides” with any country but that they will not stand by and see our planet destroyed by atomic bombs.

Our radiation problem was also discussed. The space people are now using a new device to rid our atmosphere of radiation from atomic and hydrogen bomb explosions. This device is dropped from a high altitude and acts as an umbrella to cover a large area and not only purifies our air but sometimes nullifies the action of the bomb itself.

We saw many icebergs floating over us which looked like large white clouds. These icebergs were completely submerged and appeared to be floating underneath the surface of the water. We heard many large crashes where ice was cracking up. It seemed that the ice was much heavier on one side of the North Pole than on the other. The ice bulged up in huge quantities, then broke open with loud crashes.

We rose to the surface of the water and landed on the ice cap. I saw animals which were thawing out that had been frozen in the ice for probably thousands of years. There were polar bears, walruses, and some prehistoric animals which I have never seen pictured. Eskimos had apparently been slicing off some of the

well preserved meat from the walruses and using it for dog food or some other purpose. I also saw what appeared to be a small city with houses and buildings for stores which were completely frozen in the ice.

While on the spacecraft, one of the ladies said, "We know you Americans like coffee, and we have come prepared to give you some." I thought perhaps they had a thermos bottle filled with coffee, so I told them I would enjoy a cup. She put some water and coffee in what I took to be a percolator. I noticed on the can that it was M-J-B coffee, which is an American brand.

She placed the percolator on a table. I expected her to either plug it in some place or put it on a hot plate, but she did neither. Soon I heard the coffee percolating and could smell it. I asked what made it percolate like that. She replied, "This is the same power and energy - free energy - which drives this ship. The power that drives this ship is cooking the coffee."

They told me I could hold the percolator in my hand. I lifted it up and it still percolated. They stated that I could even hold it on a chunk of ice and it would continue. I asked if I might take it home to show my people what free energy could do. They answered that I couldn't have that percolator but that they would bring me one from their planet when they came back here again. The coffee was very good and tasted just like our coffee.

During the four days I was on the spaceship, from August 14 through August 19, I ate only a few small wafers which were about the size of an Alka Seltzer, only twice as thick. They were very pleasing to the taste. One day I ate three of them to see how much power was in them. I had no hunger pangs and never felt hungry. During recent lec

THE KEARNEY INCIDENT                                                                                        43

it up to the quarry and we will take 
the Buick along." I told them it 
really wasn't necessary because I 
could leave it at a garage, for the 
car weighs about two tons and it 
would be a lot of extra weight. Their 
reply was_ "Weight doesn't mean 
anything." 
       I made my telephone calls and 
then drove out to the quarry. I saw 
that the ship was already there. It 
was a larger ship than I had seen 
before, being about two hundred feet 
long. forty feet wide, and fourteen 
feet in height. Other than size and 
the fact that it contained a few less 
instruments, this ship was almost 
identical in appearance and furnish- 
ings with the ship I saw near Kear- 
ney, Nebraska. The personnel was 
the same. 
       There is'a large eighteen or twenty 
feet steel galvanized tank beside my 
quarry, fed by a spring, which was 
placed there by the Government for 
animals such as deer and cattle to 
drink from. The space people had 
drawn about half of the water from 
the tank * probably fourteen or fif- 
teen barrels. The space people use 
water in the ship to keep it cool. 
         As soon as I arrived, they let the 
ramp down on the fore End of the 
ship and I drove the Buick up on 
it; they lifted the ramp * and wd 
started for the North Pole! 
         We left the quarry at 4:15 in the 
afternoon. An hour and twenty min- 
utes later we were over the Arctic 
Circle, having made three stops, one 
in Greenland for about thirty min- 
utes, and two short stops in Alaska 
to check on some minerals. At one 
time during the flight I asked them 
how fast the ship could go. They 
answered that they would give me 
a fast ride. At that time we were 
approximately six or seven miles 
high, and for a few minutes, accord- 
ing to an instrument which I would 
call a speedometer, we went 40,000 
miles an hour. They said the craft 
would go a lot faster but that we 
did not have enough distance to 
really turn it loose. There was no 
vibration, and the only way I could 
tell we had gone so high was the 
appearance of the earth below us. 
The earth was almost obscured by 
what appeared to be rings similar 
to those we see around the planet 
Saturn. The predominant color was 
blue-green showing through the sil- 
very rings of haze. This same ship 
can be used as a plane in the air, a 
ship on the water, or a submarine 
beneath the Water. While in the air 
the ship flew broadside. 
        As we were flying over the Arctic 
Circle they pointed out many inter- 
esting things. They showed me a 
place where once there were icecaps 
a thousand or so feet high. Today it 
is a lake. They told me this was 
caused by atomic bombs changing 
our atmosphere so that it is be- 
coming warmer in some places and 
colder in others. The Arctic Circle, 
has been cold for thousands of years, 
but today the ice is receding. 
        We settled down on the open wa- 
ter, then submerged beneath the ice- 
cap to a depth of approximately 
three or four hundred feet, where 
we remained for three or four hours. 
While underneath the surface of 
the water I saw something which  
has never yet been revealed to the 
ublic. I have written to Washing. 
on asking permission to give out 
this information but at the date of 
Writing this report I have heard 
nothing from the Pentagon. Assum- 
ing there is no reason for further 
secrecy, I will give this Information 
now: 
       We observed two Russian sub- 
marines which were mapping the 
floor of the ocean in order to build 
missile bases from which they could 
fire missiles to any part of the world, 
without sound and without warn-

SUPERMAN--DOES HE REALLY EXIST?

of time. What of the inter-relations of the Federations and the awful gulfs of space between them? Do they, can they operate and communicate over such distances? 

This seems impossible to our minds. Our scientists say that no vehicle could ever quite reach or exceed the speed of light. This observation may be valid to fit the facts as we have them established, but it is also made on the concept that light is "constant" in its own right. It has not allowed for the application of "intelligence" to a naturally oc- curring force. Despite any evidence we may have to the contrary, it is certain that a powered vehicle can and has traveled· many times the speed of light.

The cosmic men seem to be much interested in us and our first at- tempts to establish space travel, as their presence around our research centers indicate. The fact that they have been visiting this solar system for centuries without making contact indicates highly complex operations involving a powerful and exact science far beyond our scope of knowledge.

At present the men of Earth are not prepared for a meeting of the minds with the cosmic men. Nor will we be when we walk on the outermost planet of our solar system. But when our first inter-stellar ship heads for the stars, we can be certain they will be knocking on our cabin door.

tures, when I have described these 
wafers, the ladies have been very in-
terested in them because it would
solve their cooking and dishwashing
problems. I do not know what the
space people ate.
While we were sleeping the craft
hovered in space about six or seven
miles above the earth. I inquired
whether this wasn't dangerous as 
another ship or a meteorite might
strike us. They assured me that there 
was no danger for they use an auto-
matic pilot during such times, and
if another ship came within range
it would avoid the ship we were on.
My bed was similar to the one to 
which I am accustomed, with a mat-
tress and made up with sheets, pil-
lows and blankets. The ship was al-
ways warm and remained at a con-
stant temperature. I do not know 
where the heat and light came from, 
but it was light all of the time. Even 
when we were beneath the surface
of the water the light glowed from
the ship for a distance of three or
four hundred feet or more.
Upon our return from the Arctic 
Circle, I drove my car out of the 
spacecraft, up Highway 6, and back
to Hollywood. As I left, the space
people told me they would see me a-
gain in the near future.
I had to get a new battery for my
1958 Buick, for the old one was com-
pletely dead the second day' after
my return. When it was tested at the
garage they found nothing but pure 
water in it. I also found, during my
earlier contacts, as described in Part
I of this book, that each time I was
stopped by the spacecraft, the bat-
tery in my 1955 Buick boiled dry. 
One time the top of the battery was
completely blown off as if a great
pressure had been exerted below it,
and a black tar-like substance had
spread over the top.
This concludes the report of my
contacts with the people from the
Planet Saturn up to the present
time. However, I shall be watching
for I am sure they will keep their
promise to return again soon.

The Saturnian Visitors
Tuesday evening while the nation was still wondering about the
flying eggs in New Mexico and the invisible UFOs that buzzed
the Ssbago, welcome comic relief appeared. A man named Schmidt,
a grain buyer, announced that during the afternoon he had visited
with the crew of a flying saucer that had landed to make repairs.
While driving in the country near Kearney, Nebraska, he said, he
had noticed a bright flash about a quarter of a mile away. Going
closer to investigate, he perceived a huge silvery ship a hundred
feet long, thirty feet wide, and fourteen-feet high, which hed landed
in a dry river bed. The motor of his car then died. He got out and
was walking toward the ship when a light shot out and paralyzed
him. The ship opened and two men emerged. After searching him
for concealed weapons, they released him from paralysis and in-
vited him into the ship, where he spent half an hour chatting with
these strangers and their female companions, mostly in High Ger-
man and English, (He knew that they came from outer space but
not until some weeks later, when they paid him a second visit, did
ld to these strangers and their fenes one at tn German
he discover that they were natives of the planet Saturn.) [14] After
he left the ship it rose straight up into the sky and disappeared,
while he hurried back to town to report to the sheriff, to broadcast
an account of his experience over the local radio, and to give his
story to the newspapers.

It is perhaps a measure of the panic level that week that local
officials actually examined the ground at the “landing” site, looking
for evidence. They found none. The four “hydraulic rams” that al-
legedly supported the huge machine had left no imprint on the
sand of the dry river bed. Traces of oil found on the ground were
tested chemically and proved to be the same brand that the witness
carried in the trunk of his car.

Gaining national notoriety from this incident, Schmidt som be-
came a popular lecturer at flying-saucer clubs, thrilling the audience
with tales of later visits from the Saturnians and his journeys in
their spaceship to the Arctic Circle, through the waters under the
North Pole, and even into outer space. A year or so later his extrater-
restri&l friends allegedly tipped him off to the location of certain
valuable minerals on earth, including veins of quartz that had the
desirable property of curing cancer. To mine this quartz and thus
make it available to humanity, he enlisted the sympathy and finan-
Cial aid of a number of lonely, wealthy widows. Some of these ladies
eventually came to believe that they had been the victims of fraud
and, in 1981, a California jury agreed with them. The Saturnians
apparently have not yet reappeared to help their friend out of his
difficulties.

Saucer Visitor
Is Ex-Convict

By UNITED PRESS

Authorities in Kearney, Neb., today held a “heart to heart” talk with a salesman, later discovered to be an ex-convict who claimed he chattea with tour men and two women in a transparent “space ship.” The report by Reinhold O. Schmidt, 48, of Baker s field, Ca!., last night was the most dramatic of a host of unidentified flying object sightings reported across the country.

SCHMIDT'S TALE, as strange as any science-fiction story, drew considerable al dence in the Kearney area for a time. Police roped off the spot where the “Martian”-lik jevedly landed and examined various impressions and oil stains on the ground. But curiosity turned to skep ticism when ScottbHif County Sheriff Harry Wexler revealed that Schmidt, a former pot to buyer in Scottbluff, Neb., was a former convict who served time in the Nebraska Penitentiary for embezzlement.

However Schmidt stuck by his story. Police said they held a “heart fo heart’’ talk with Schmidt last night and planned further questioning today.

Elsewhere, strange “saucer” sightings sent Air Force pilot scrambling to investigate, kepi police switchboards busy and brought hundreds of person out to watch the sky. Scores of other sightinqs in the Midwest last night apparently stemmed from stars and the planet Venus playing tricks on the viewers. Other reports were not so easily explained. The Coast Guard reported picking up a—and
Gulf of Mexico south of New Oilcans. A Coast Guard skipper, tola :
the ship Sebago in the Gulf of Mexico south of New Orleans. A Coast Guard commander said the object paused over the cutter Sebago in the GuR for a time.
MILITAYR police and motorists said they saw a bright object hovering near the U. S proving Grounds at White Sands, N. M They saht the object killed the engines on their cars.
A “ved ball was sighted by several persons last night over the Atomic Energy Commissionis Savannah River plant near Augusta, Ga. The Au gsta Editor of the Augusta Chronicle, Louis Harris, said the object appeared to be a “constant red light.”
Flying lights over northen Illinois and southern Wisconsin last night spurred police and military authorities into a frenzy of hurried investigations.

Two persons in northern Illinois said the engines of their cars quit running and headlights weiit out when a object appeared in the sky. Planes from Travis Air Force Starion I Vis. and O'Hare Field in Chicago investigated and later reported the object was a star

Continued From Page One said he saw an object which made car engines stall near the White Sands Proving Grounds.

COL. JOHN McCURDY, Air Force public relations officer at White Sands, said the engineer, James Stokes, 42, will be given a thorough medical examination and a radiation count test. McCurdy said he was "personally satisfied" with Mr. Stokes' report.

Also in the Southwest, a civil service worker at Lack-land Air Force Base in San Antonio, Tex., said he saw an egg-shaped object land in a ravine about 200 yards from him as he drove near the city. Ted Yarbrough said his car engine and lights went off, and the object took off in a few minutes, enabling him to drive away.

At about the same time, the Ground Observer Corps at Midland, Tex., said it saw a large, fiery object and picked up conversation on a sound detector. The conversation was unintelligible.

In Long Beach, Cal., three Air Force weather observers, one of them the commanding officer of the post, two days later Friday reported sighting six unidentified, saucer-shaped flying objects over Long Beach Air Force Base.

The objects also were reportedly seen by 10 military personnel who were waiting to board a plane, according to the spotting unit.

First to sight the objects, described as flying at an altitude of about 7000 feet at the base of clouds, was commanding officer Maj. Louis F. Baker. Airmen Joseph Abramavage and William Nieland, weather observers, also said they saw the objects.

Mr. Abramavage, who made the report, said the objects were "circular in shape and shiny like spun aluminum, changing course instantaneously without loss of speed like planes in a mock dogfight."

IV. FURTHER LTA'EMEN'13: SCRTE: was interviewed for two (2) hours, resulting in the following amplification in his story.

1. The flash of light drawing his attention initially was similar to an electrical short, reddish in color, and did not blind the SOURCE. SOURCE was approximately one-half (2) mile from the scene.

2. SOURCE did not attempt to check his automobile for battery failure, such as horn, lights or radio.

3. SOURCE was approximately thirty (30) feet from the object when the paralyzing light hit him. The light, orange in color, concentrated on him, not blinding or causing him of his sense other than movement, seemed to come from a two (2) inch diameter source on the end of the object and lasted for two (2) or three (3) seconds. Paralysis lasted for approximately ten (10) seconds.

4. Searching of the SOURCE by the two (2) men was simply a "patting" operation. His pockets were not searched nor did the SOURCE touch any people at any time.

5. The four (4) men, about 5t4tt tall, dark complexed, were dressed in ordinary street suits. Each appeared to be dressed in different subdued tones of browns and blues, brown shoes, hats with narrow brims, and full length ties with subdued designs. One (1) man wore a small mustache (Hitler type). The two (2) women were dressed in white blouses and brown shirts, no lipstick, had shorty cut brown hair, wore initialed silver chain necklaces with a pendant in the center. All appeared to be between forty-five (45) and fifty (50) years of age.

6. The men spoke to SOURCE in broken English, but conversed with each other in High German. SOURCE understand German because his parents emigrated from that country.
 
7. Entrance to the object was by retracting stairway of some (t) steps. The door opened and closed automatically and without visible command. * . 

8. The interior was about forty (40) feet long. Instruments mounted on aluminum stands lined the sides of the interior. SOURCE was unable to describe exactly any instrumentation except to say that a variety of circular and linear dials of various sizes were noticed. Both Roman numerals and ordinary numbers were noted on the dials.

9. SOURCE stated that the interior of the object was lighted from a point source. No noise other than the door shutting was heard. It was possible to see through the sides, bottom and floor of the object, being perfectly transparent .not possible to see through the ends of the object to the sections housing the mechanisms presumed to provide propulsion. A lounge consisting of a metal stand brown upholstera; sofa and two (2) chairs was located at the far end of the room.

10. A two-way conveyor apparatus ran the length of the room (40 feet). SOURCE observed other stepping on the conveyor and being transported at about walking speed, stepping off the conveyor at any point along its length. SOURCE stated, however, that numerous parts were noted, leading him to assume that some magnetic force was driving the conveyor. The two (2) women and three (3) men explained the levers worked the dials while the remaining men escort the SOURCE. The wires ran front the instruments through cut into she section of the object."

    Contacts With Space People
    Glossing quickly over the most
documented sightings, the AF con-
centrated on one case the explainers
felt they could thoroughly discredit
and thus infer that the other ones
were just as unreliable. They had
the perfect setup; a man who claim-
ed he had been inside a space ship
and talked to the occupants. The

man in the street tended to discount
so-called “contact stories.” And as
soon as it had been learned that the
man had a prison record, the anti-
saucer elements began to have a
field day. To cap it off they had
the witness put in the booby hatch,
but apparently were able to hold him
there only a few days.

    You’ve probably heard much of
the Kearney Nebr., case. Reinhold
Schmidt, grain dealer of California,
said he had come upon a huge ob-
ject resting in a river bed. At first
he thought it was a huge balloon—
but instead of reporting what was in
the papers, let FLYING SAUCERS
bring out the next best thing to
hearing a taped interview with
Schmidt. Thanks to a friend who
broadcasts a flying saucer radio pro-
gram, and Gene Larson, news direc-
tor of Station KGFW, Kearney,
Nebr., we publish the interview
verbatim, as it went out over the air.

    LARSON: This is Gene Larson,
news director of Radio Station
KGFW, in Kearney, Nebraska. At
the present time on this Tuesday
evening, Nov. 5, 1957, we are at our
studio. The time is central standard
time, 7:20. At our side at micro-
phone we have a Mr. Reinhold O.
Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt has stated
that his home address in Bakersville,
California, is 715 Gage St., and that
he is employed by Valle-Pak, Inc.
They are in the wholesale hay, feed
and grain concentrates. Their office
is 501 West Main St., at Brawley,
California. Mr. Schmidt, this after-
noon I believe you had something
occur to you, and you talked a little
bit about it. We would like to ask
you a series of questions. The infor-
mation that I have given so far, Mr.
Schmidt, is that correct?

    SCHMIDT: Yes.

    LARSON: In other words you
work for Valle-Pak, Inc., you live
in Bakersville—you are in Kearney,

```
CHASING THE FLYING SAUCERS            29 Nebraska for what purpose?
SCHMIDT: Buying grain.
LARSON: Is this your first trip to Kearney?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And by buying grain, what do you mean, sir?
SCHMIDT: Buying for the farmas elevators.
LARSON: And you travel around the country, sir?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And you drive what kind of a car, sir?
SCHMIDT: A '55 Buick Super.
LARSON: Now this afternoon I believe you were out south of town —about how far, sir?
SCHMIDT: About four miles.
LARSON: About what time was this?
SCHMIDT: Between 2:00 and 3:00 in the afternoon.
LARSON: And you were headed in which direction?
SCHMIDT: I was going south, and then turned east on the Newark highway.
LARSON: You noticed something in the Piatt River bed, am I right, that it was dry — ?
SCHMIDT: There was a flash there—what I first noticed.
LARSON: And that was how far from the road, sir?
SCHMIDT: About, half a mile, I would say.
LARSON: Did you continue to drive, or did you immediately stop?
SCHMIDT: No, I drove on up a little closer to where the flash was, to see what caused it, and when I got so close I found out—I thought it was a balloon that had crashed there.
LARSON: Then you drove closer to the object?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And then what occurred?
SCHMIDT: When I got within 50 feet of the object my car stopped. The motor went dead. I tried to step on the starter, but there was no response whatsoever. I got out of the car. I figured the terminal had just broken loose on the battery. I got out of the car and walked toward this balloon—or what I thought was a balloon—and when I got within 30 feet of it, a light shot out and, I wouldn't say it paralyzed me, I would say it hypnotized me (Schmidt's voice shows confusion as to the exact effect of the ray—G.B.).
LARSON: You couldn't move?
SCHMIDT: I couldn't move.
LARSON: Could you think?
SCHMIDT: Yes, I could think and talk, but I couldn't move.
LARSON: Before we go into further happenings in regard to this object, wonder if you could describe it. About how long was it, sir?
SCHMIDT: It was about a hundred feet long, as near as we could step it off, and 30 feet wide, and I judge it was 14 feet high.
LARSON: What did it appear to be made of?
SCHMIDT: Real bright aluminum.
LARSON: Now this was in the bed of the Piatt River, which is dry at the present time? It was sandy there?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: It appeared to be of aluminum, bright and shiny. And as you got out and you approached this object. Did you notice anything as to how it would move? Did there appear to be pipes, or propellors, or what was it?
SCHMIDT: On each end of the machine there was a tube running up and down, and in these tubes I could see big fans. It seemed like that did the propelling.
LARSON: How close did you get to this object?
SCHMIDT: I got to it and in it.
LARSON: I understand that, sir.

The text on the page appears to be a transcript or report of a conversation or interview regarding a sighting of "flying saucers". The text describes the details of the sighting, including the physical appearance of the objects, the witnesses' reactions, and the questioning of the witnesses by investigators. However, there is no human face visible in the image, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

CHASING THE FLYING SAUCERS
but before you got into it, you got
this attitude towards advanced the
modern machines that the Government
had, and now what did you see before you
noticed this? 
LARSON: Then what did I see? Well, I
looked at it. And it was light and flat,
and seemed to be revolving - rather fast.
As you know, then what occurred?
SCHMIDT: Now then, come right out.
What did you think then? What would they
have to search out of the side of
this machine?
LARSON: All I know is that it came
down to the ground.
SCHMIDT: Yes, the there was a sliding
door. Now, what do you mean by that?
LARSON: I don't know how to explain it
and they spoke that in English.
SCHMIDT: How were you dressed?
SCHMIDT: They were dressed like
any American would be. In business
suits.
LARSON: Did they appear to be
young or middle-aged?
SCHMIDT: Well, I would say between 40 and
45. 
LARSON: And they spoke good
English?
SCHMIDT: No, they spoke a broken
English.
LARSON: What did they say to
you?
SCHMIDT: They tell me they were not to
be alarmed, that they were not going to
hurt me, that they did not have any
weapons, and that they were just out on
a routine observation, as far as I could
make out. As long as we can't leave for a
few minutes, you can come in and look
around.
SCHMIDT: In this object, were there four
LARSON: Ladies? What age did
they appear to be?
SCHMIDT: They just said "hello,"
and they did that as they were
closing the door - "hello, and goodbye."
LARSON: And what did you see, anything
inside that object?
LARSON: Yes, I saw a lot of instruments, and wires, and it
seemed like they were working on
instruments or something. Two
girls were as assistants instruments
there with a lot of dials and push
buttons.
LARSON: After these women and
these men got into this object, and
closed the door, that was the last I
saw.
SCHMIDT: And it was the one who
talked to you?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And the two women and
the other man, they just stood there
like they were on some kind of
business? Did they appear to be
interested in you after saying
hello?
SCHMIDT: No, 
LARSON: What did they talk about?

SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And what language were they using?
SCHMIDT: They were talking in high German, as much as I could tell—that machine was about a hundred feet long, as I’ve said, and they were talking high German every time I could hear them.
LARSON: Are you qualified to know high German, Mr. Schmidt?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And they didn’t appear to be interested in you personally, after you said Hello?
SCHMIDT: No.
LARSON: And now you were in the object about how long, Mr. Schmidt?
SCHMIDT: I would say about 30 minutes.
LARSON: What did you do while you were in there?
SCHMIDT: I was just talking to this man, although he didn’t explain anything to me.
LARSON: You asked him questions?
SCHMIDT: Yes, I asked him some more about what they were doing, and he said he couldn’t tell me that but in the near future we might all know, he said—to tell my people that they mean no harm.
LARSON: And then did something occur that would indicate to you that perhaps the machinery was repaired?
SCHMIDT: Yes, this one man who was working at one end, he said they would be ready to take off—in German language.
LARSON: And you recognized it?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: Still high German?
SCHMIDT: Yes. And then this man told me, in American, that they were ready to take off and that I would have to leave. I went out of the machine, the door closed, the ladder went up and I stepped back about ten feet—they didn’t tell me to watch out or anything—and when the machine started going, why, I stepped back a little farther. And then I watched them leave.
LARSON: How did they leave?
SCHMIDT: It went straight up into the air. Slowly at first, then it gained speed, until it got about 150 to 200 feet in the air. It seemed like there was a flash there, and it just disappeared. 
LARSON: Now, you could see any object of this size 150 feet in the air?
SCHMIDT: Oh, yes. It just disappeared. It changed color.
LARSON: Did they have any instructions to you after you left?
SCHMIDT: They told me not to try and start the automobile “until after we leave, for it won’t start anyway.” Then he kinda smiled, and that’s when I first knew they had done something to the automobile.
LARSON: Did you personally feel they were friendly toward you?
SCHMIDT: Yes, very friendly.
LARSON: But disinterested in you as a person?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: May I ask you this, now, Mr. Smith? You were with them, or near them, for about how long a timer?
SCHMIDT: I would say 30 to 35 minutes. It took about five minutes to come out there and get me and bring me back.
LARSON: And after it vanished, up there in the sky, you decided to go what, sir?
SCHMIDT: I went to my automobile, and started to the Sheriff’s office.
LARSON: Let me ask you this: Were you scared?
SCHMIDT: Not it that time I---

wasn’t so much, until that beam hit me. At first I thought it was just a balloon which had crashed there.
LARSON: And you came up here and talked to the Buffalo County sheriff, Lloyd Frank, was that right?
SCHMIDT: His deputy.
LARSON: And then what happened?
SCHMIDT: The sheriff and myself, we went out there, and he was convinced that something had been there. Then we came back and got the city manager—
LARSON: That’s Ray Lundy, yes—
SCHMIDT: The chief of police—
LARSON: That’s Thurston Nelson?
SCHMIDT: That’s right.
LARSON: And all of you returned to the scene then. And was there any evidence left at the scene that would indicate that this had occurred?
SCHMIDT: Yes. The sheriff, I think it was, and myself, we picked up some leaves there that had some, we thought it was hydraulic oil or something like that—it had a peculiar smell to it. It was a greenish color.
LARSON: Were there marks on the ground?
SCHMIDT: It seemed like this one we could see where this one hydraulic skid had hit the ground.
LARSON: I see. Were there footprints, where these men had walked?
SCHMIDT: Yes, it was sandy. There were footprints there.
LARSON: And you explained to them what had actually happened, and they were convinced that some of this had occurred, if not all, actually?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: What are your personal feelings, Mr. Schmidt, about this? Have you had a chance yet to calm down enough to really get at it?
SCHMIDT: I really haven’t so far, but I don’t know whether there is such a thing as outer space—or a machine from outer space—or it might be from a different country.
LARSON: You feel it might be either one of the two?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: What race would you say they were?
SCHMIDT: German.
LARSON: Well we want to thank you very much, Mr. Schmidt, for this opportunity of talking with you. We appreciate it very much. You are very definitely going to be interrogated by the various law enforcement bodies. There will be news media after you. We appreciate this chance to talk to you first hand about this. Do you have anything else you would like to say at this time?
SCHMIDT: No, I guess that’s all that I have to say.
LARSON: Thank you very much, Mr. Reinhold O. Schmidt, of Bakersville, California. This is Gene Larson, News Director of Station KGFW, in Kearney, Nebraska,

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document describing a "Kearney, Nebraska 'Contact' Claim" incident.

THE KEARNEY, NEBRASKA "CONTACT" CLAIM
This story was told in this it told of a "contact" with saucer pilots who might be "spacesmen" at all, but ordinary human beings from somewhere on earth. Apparently some farmers or ranchers it is said were engaged in conversation with one of these beings, who told stories told immediately afterwards. Much as Everett Clark's or Dr. Hynek's, the tale is not now available, might just possibly be true, since this case is undoubtedly one of the most intriguing to come forward from the Kearney hill as a "landing" or "contact" incident.
The teller of the story, Reinhold Schmidt, a grain buyer from Bakersfield, California who lives-near and farming South Dakota, Shearer, is said to have approached him on the afternoon of Nov. 5th and told him what he had seen. It was said that his car engine had stalled "without any apparent reason", and as he got out and approached a "saucer" standing on four posts. As he got out and approached the saucer, he claimed there were three men standing near it, dressed in ordinary clothing, engaged in repairing some wiring. "They showed no alarm at his approach", and one said: "We'll have to be a little while - you'll just have to wait a little while."
Later on the same day, said Schmidt, these three "persons" entered the "saucer" and it took off at a terrific rate of speed, heading in the direction of Kansas. Schmidt claimed they had conversed freely with him, and that the saucer and its "passengers" were gone. As an information Item, he said the three "men" were all around 5 feet 8 inches in height, dressed in ordinary street clothing, engaged in repairing some wiring.
No photographs or corroborating evidence is available, and Project Blue Book states that the "case remains unresolved". It was officially characterized as "undetermined". However, Schmidt did make an immediate report to the Air Force, and apparently a check was made. The dispatch reported that two Air Force investigators from "nearby" interviewed him, but "stuck to his story," and that the court-martial of an airman "at this request" had been requested, but stuck to his story." It disclosed also that he (Schmidt) had refused to take a lie detector test, saying that he had known Schmidt for 7 years, and that Schmidt's county sheriff said he had known Schmidt for 5 years, and that he was "not the type to fabricate something."

On the morning of the 7th County Attorney Kenneth Gotobed "filed a mental-illness 
complflint against Schmidt after an "extensive examination" by two psychiatrists the 
preceding evening. Gotobed said that Schmidt "continues to use almost the exact 
words each time he tells his story" and that according to the doctors he "greatly 
desires recognition and publicity" (Hub and AP). If found sane, however, he would 
be "free to go his own way"; government officials "discouraged filing charges in 
such cases, for fear that other persons might refuse to report significant events"(UP).

A hearing by the county board of mental-health was held the same evening, 7:30-
9:45 p.m. The examining psychiatrists advised that Schmidt was "very ill" (AP) end 
"in immediate need of psychiatric treatment" (UP), and he was committed to the Hast-
ings State Hospital "for an indefinite period." 

The UP story also reported that "authorities said they had received information: 
from his family that Schmidt was suffering from seeming 'instabilities,' and demands 
on him from unidentified persons and 'crackpots.'" This last phrase suggests para- 
noid delusions. However, we find from the Hub that it was not Schmidt himself, but 
the Kearney police, who had complained of "an increasing demand on the part of_un-
identified persons and obvious crackpots to place a greater strain upon Mr. Schmidt"
(unfbrfhndtely this refers to requests for interviews by saucer aficionados). The Hub 
adds that the concern for the well-being of Mr. Sch.idt was increased Thursd by 
statements by observation, thut hi... ounsIdcr..  ... aad considler...-  ut it an s in ms delusion

appeared in Kearney papers, but bey yt in New York) that Schmidt had been committed 
on the preceding evening. 


What happened to Schmidt was publicized by nearly every paper in the country, 
and the Air Force was obviously happy to give the incident prominence as "one of the 
only five worthy to be investigated." Regardless of what the true facts are in the 
S8hm1dt case, it is an example that will certainly tend to discourage future wit-
nesses of saucer landings from reporting their experiences. 


We must assume that the psychiatrists were justified in their verdict; it seems 
impossible to take seriously the idea that they would be party to any "railroading" 
conspiracy, or that they were unable to distinguish nervous strain from insanity. 
But the extraordinary speed of the commitment, the participation of the Air Force, 
and the fact that no conclusive proof of Schmidt's insanity was ever made public, 
are bound to arouse a great deal of suspicion in the saucer world. We are glad to 
say that Jules St. Germain (CSI's legal adviser) intends to look into the legal as-
pects of the case. We hope that his findings and comment can appear in the next News 
Letter.

11. The exterior of the object was touched by SOURCE who described the sensation as that of touching shiny metal. SOURCE was not sure of the color, but kind on the interior or where the cross supports go inside is same. The object rests on four (4) shiny metal supports about three (3), or four (4) inches in diameter and three (3) feet long, slanted outward and up on which black "pins" of about twelve (12) inches in diameter.

12. The object began rising slowly, with little acceleration until it reached a height of ten (10) feet, then sped up slightly, reaching a maximum height of 125 feet in one and one-half (1 1/2) minutes. The object did not hover, but transitioned in smooth lines. While a loud humming noise was heard, there was no wind blast felt by SOURCE. Added he says the fans were about twenty-five (25) feet in length, and was about twelve (12) feet in diameter. Source could not detect any entrance to the said hous­ings fans, either within the object or on the outside.

13. ATTACHING draws his car to a nearby farmhouse to inquire whether the occupants had also observed the object. They had not.
