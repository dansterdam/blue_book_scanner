INFORMATION ONLY

17 March 1950
CARLSBAD, New Mexico
(BALLOON) Observation

Plastic UFOs and the "Stack of Coins"

A burst balloon has caused many a saucer scare, but the invasion of Farmington, New Mexico, on Saint Patrick's Day 1950 was one of the most dramatic. The "saucers" began to fly about 10:15 A.M. M.S.T., and soon filled the air. In numbers estimated from 500 to thousands, for the next hour the gleaming saucer-shaped objects soared over the town, moving erratically at incredible speeds, darting in and out among each other in what one writer has called "the greatest exhibition of magnetic flight that has ever happened in this universe." [6] (See Chapter ix.)
The explanation is more prosaic. A Skyhook balloon had been launched that morning from Holloman Air Force Base near White Sands, New Mexico. Near Farmington, in the cold atmosphere at 60,000 feet the balloon had become brittle, burst, and disintegrated into hundreds of tiny pieces of plastic. Light as feathers, shining in the sunlight, they floated over the town and away [1, p. 106].

There does not appear to be a photograph in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a document titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" dated March 17, 1950. The text appears to contain details about an observation of an unidentified flying object near Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. The document describes the object as "having a good definitive metallic appearance" and "somewhat saucer-shaped". It also mentions that the object was observed moving in a vertical and horizontal manner at a high rate of speed.

The text in the document is as follows:

Sighting of military AT Kirtland AFB as officer and three enlisted men observed an unusual aerial phenomenon. This was within the radar coverage of the base but was not detected on the radarscope. Phenomenon had a good definitive metallic appearance and was somewhat saucer-shaped. It was observed moving in a vertical as well as a horizontal manner at a high rate of speed. This was ruled out as a jet aircraft or other aerial target.
