DATE: 5 Aug. 1955

While vacationing in Europe, another physician and I had a very unusual experience. I was sitting on the open air patio early one morning at the Castellana Hilton Hotel in Madrid writing a letter. 9 a.m. had been quite warm during the day and after the humidity was low, it was still somewhat uncomfortable. I remember watching the sun go below the horizon just as I was completing the letter. Dr. [redacted] was also on the veranda and kept remarking about some birds ("swifts") that were darting around the building.

When I glanced up at the sky towards the north west I saw what I first interpreted as a large soaring bird, such as a hawk or eagle, floating along high above all the others. I was a bit curious about it and as I watched this thing approach from the west it became quite apparent that it was not a bird, not a plane, not anything I had ever seen before - because it was silhouetted against the brilliant sky as a perfect circle, resembling pictures I have seen of the sun at total eclipse. I called Dr. [redacted]

a Attention to it and we both jokingly said
"flying saucers". But as the seconds passed
it soon became any thing but a joke.

I automatically kept trying to
eliminate all possibilities that could explain
the thing on a natural basis, but
got nowhere. When it was almost totally
dark when the sky (being when we
were there) got dark, they could not
(illuminated) or contrasted by the bright sky
sky (he hinted) to convince us otherwise of its
reality, we both yelled, "get the
camera, quick."

The thing seemed to go fairly slowly
over the land and started to pick up
speed and when we looked it was very
distinctly. Seems it could be seen in the
view-finder of the camera telling it
will be lucky if we get a decent picture
of it because the film was against the
flasher setting so and it was over Color
film quite exactly the best for such a shot.

Many rate we tried, and we will turn it
The negative of it shows any thing at all.
This was a disturbing experience to us
and we would have been more convinced
object sighted were both more or less convinced
that such sightings were usually reported only
by cranks or crack-pots and merely represented
some easily explained natural phenomenon
that had become distorted + misinterpreted
by hysterical individuals.

However, though we were 9 feet
+ very close to the object near the "D"
Technical Intelligence Center, and can only repeat
that the photographic guidance, which we show those in
connection, could be to frame it.

ADDENDUM

I. Dr. [redacted] has reviewed this report and concurs with all opinions expressed except for answer to Question #22.

We both agree that this is the most difficult paragraph near the end. A color-tiled A arms length against the sky. (I look in a window, looks large; if tiled against a vast expanse of sky, it appears small; (for the same reason that the full moon looks much larger when rising than when over head).

However, after practicing with coins etc., he has convinced me that my answer is probably incorrect, and that the object was between "pea" + "dime" sized.

It is easier for me to say that it appeared to be about 1/4 the size of the full moon - (when seen at its closest approach).

II. Dr. [redacted] was in the U.S. Navy during W.W. II. at a location where launching of weather balloons was very common. I have no opportunity of observing these, but as is furnished with their appearance and is conversant that the incident-find object was not any type of balloon that he has ever seen.

Photo will be mailed as soon as available.

Sincerely,

II.  RELIABILITY:   Good.   In a personal interview SOURCE seemed positive of all his statements and displayed a good knowledge of speed, distance, and altitude. He was disturbed only in his lack of an explanation of what the object, which he saw and repeated the statements that he wished he had never seen the object.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was writing a letter on the open-air patio of the G STEFANI HILTON in MADRID, SPAIN, at the time of the sighting which was 14JUL55. The sun had set approximately five (5) to ten (10) minutes before the sighting. The evening was a clear, warm twilight, warm dry with no wind. The single object appeared black and became chocolate colored as it came overhead and then turned to the solid black color. The object was estimated to be one hundred (100) to two hundred (200) feet in diameter, spherical in shape, and have a clearly defined outline. Object traveled in what appeared to be a straight line accelerated gradually after passing over the city to what appeared to be a supersonic speed (APRX one thousand (1000) MPH).

        Object appeared to be solid and did not move behind anything while being observed. The only aid in observation was view-finder of early model ARGUS C-3 camera with F 1.5 lens.

        SOURCE'S opinion of the size of object based on altitude estimation of five (5) to ten (10) thousand feet and approximate size of a nickle held at arm's length during observation. This estimation of size was later changed to between pea and dime size, "all at arm's length".

        SOURCE has no opinion of what the object could be but stated that he is certain it was not a conventional or delta-wing aircraft, weather balloon, reflection, satellite, or hallucination.

        SOURCE stated duration of sighting was between one and one half (1½) to two (2) minutes.

re: "Flying Saucer" information.

Dear Sirs:

Another Long Beach, Calif. physician & myself are vacationing in Europe for the month of July. Neither of us had ever seriously considered the possibility of "Flying saucers" being real objects, and assumed that all such observations could be explained on the basis of natural phenomena or pure hysteria.

However, just after sunset this evening (8 35 PM Madrid time), I was sitting on the open sun porch adjoining our room on the top floor of this hotel. A dark circular object appeared about 1/3 the size of the moon against the bright western sky, passed over Madrid & disappeared to the east. It took about 1 1/2 - 2 mins for it to cross the sky. Since the sky was almost perfectly clear, there were certainly no cloud effects to explain this very solid object. A few tiny cirrous (sic) clouds were illuminated by the sun, and these must have been below the altitude of the clouds (probably less than 20,000 ft.). It moved steadily, and seemed to gain speed as it passed eastward. There were no lights visible, nor was there any sound associated with it.

I do not know whether you are at all interested in this subject at this time, but we both feel it our duty to report this observation, in case it might correlate to an August report from this area, or in some way be helpful to you.

Dr. [redacted] took a photograph of the disc as it passed by and we hope it will demonstrate what we saw. If you are interested in obtaining the photo, please write to me after August 5 at the address below.

Sincerely,

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

While vacationing in Europe, another physician & I had a very unusual experience.
I was sitting on the open-air patio adjoining our room at the Castellana Hilton
Hotel in Madrid writing a letter. It had been quite warm that day and the albho
the humidity was low, it was still somewhat uncomfortable. I remember watching the
sun no 1-low in the horizon just as I was completing the letter. Directly above on
the verandah & kept remarking about some birds (pajaros) that were darting around
the building. When I next glanced up at the sky towards the northwest I saw what I
first interpreted as a huge soaring bird, such as a hawk or eagle, floating along
high above all the others. I was a 1st curious about it and said to myself something
not anything I had ever seen before - because it was silhouetted against the brilliant
sky as a perfect circle, seem like pictures of the sun at total eclipse.

I called Dr. _______ attention to it, and we both jokingly said that it must be
one of the famous "flying saucers". But as the seconds passed it soon became anything
but a joke.

I automatically kept trying to eliminate all possibilities that could explain
the thing on a natural basis, but got nowhere. When it was about half way across
the sky, (having taken all this time when the object was best illuminated or contrasted by the bright sky behind) to convince ourselves of its reality, we both
yelled, "get the camera, quick!"

The thing seemed to so fairly slowly over Madrid, but started picking up speed
as it went eastward beyond the city. Also it could be seen in the view-finder of
the camera alright, it will be lucky if we get a decent picture of it because it was
now against the darker eastern sky, and 15 mm color film isn't exactly the best for
such a shot.

At any rate, we tried, and will turn in the negative if it shows anything at all.
This was a disturbing experience to us and we really wish we had not seen the object,
since we were both more or less convinced that such sightings were usually reported
only by crackpots or crack-pots and merely represented some easily explained natural
phenomenon that had become distorted & misinterpreted by hysterical individuals.

However, though no one believes us, I felt it my duty to report this matter to
the Air Force Technical Intelligence Center, and can only hope that the photographic
evidence which we should have in another week, will be of assistance to them.

ADDENDUM

I. Dr. _______ has reviewed this report and concurs with all opinions expressed except
for answer to question #22.

We both agree that this is the most difficult question that we have asked. A
coin held at arms length at a window, looks large; if held against a vast expanse of sky, it appears small; (for the same reason that

the full moon looks much larger when rising than when over-head).

However, after practising with coins etc, he has convinced me that my answer is probably incorrect, and that the object was between "pea" & "dime" sized.

It is easier for me to say that it appeared to be about ½ the size of the full moon - (when seen at 1/10 closest approach).

II. Dr. Ellis was in the U. S. Navy during W. W. II at a location where launching of weather balloons was very common. I have never had the opportunity of observing these, but he is familiar with their appearance and is convinced that the unidentified object was not any type of balloon that he has ever seen.

Photo will be mailed as soon as available.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the reliability of the observer in this sighting is good but as sighting was from only one point no definite conclusion can be made.

2. Dr. [redacted] was not asked to submit a separate statement because he viewed the object together with SCUROS and his conclusions were the same except for a small difference in size of the object. (See Inclosure #1, Part One)

3. A limited analysis of the photographic evidence, Inclosure #1, Part Two, reveals nothing of significance. Microscopic study may alter this opinion.

NOTE: UFOB location on slide pinpointed by lines drawn on frame.

4. The only possible explanation could be an aircraft. A jet flying low would be the rays of the sun and would appear black. The exact outline would be hard to distinguish.

a. The time duration was in line with an aircraft sighting.

b. Exact altitude not definite, therefore, the great speed reported by the SCUROS could be explained by a low flying jet aircraft.

5. The three color slides, Inclosure #1, 2, and 3, Part Two of this report, are the personal property of Dr. [redacted]. Dr. [redacted] requested that they be returned to him on completion of investigation.

Re: "Flying Saucer" information.

Dear Sirs:

Another Long Beach, Calif. physician & myself are vacationing in Europe for the month of July. Neither of us had seen seriously considered the possibility of a "flying saucer" being real objects, and assumed that all such observations could be explained on the basis of natural phenomena or pure hysteria.

However, just after sunset this evening (8:35 pm Madrid time), Dr. [redacted] & I were on the open sun porch adjacent our room on the top floor of this hotel. A dark circular object appearing about 1/3 the size of the moon appeared in the bright western sky, passed over Madrid & disappeared to the east. It took about 1 1/2-2 units for it to cross the sky. Since the sky was almost perfectly clear, there were certainly no clouds to explain this very solid object. A few tiny cirrus clouds were illuminated by the sun. The disc was not, so we estimate that it must have been below the altitude of the clouds (probably less than 20,000 ft). It moved steadily, and seemed to gain speed as it passed eastward. There were no lights visible, nor was there any sound associated with it.

I do not know whether you are at all interested.

A. Hilton Holt

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

First sighted about 300 above WNW horizon

No change in direction during course.

a. Certainly showed as true
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain
e. Probably slightly larger than actual size

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
Object following to E, moving as far as possible. Almost from view, but not quite invisible by the haze or hills.

24. In order that you can give us clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

A sphere (not a disk), of metal or plastic, with dull black non-reflecting paint or covering. About 100 feet in diameter. I have no idea how such an object could be powered or provided with lift. I know of nothing other than a theoretical artificial satellite. That could give the impression of such perfect spherical shape, solidity, unswering course, and high velocity. The fact that the object appeared to consistently increase speed as it traveled eastward would rule out this possibility. It seemed to reflect the setting sun.
