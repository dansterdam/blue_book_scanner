The image contains no photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with the header "Pepperrell AFB, Newfoundland" and the date "3 February 1953".

The text in the document is as follows:

I. Description of Incident
From 0100 to 0145 local time a low unidentified object resembling the landing light on an aircraft was observed by two airmen of this base until the object disappeared below the horizon. The observation was positively a visual one with no optical aids and no radar contact.

II. Discussion of Incident
This is a very brief report with no information given on the experience level of the observers. From past experience, however, such sightings have been attributed to bright stars shining low on the horizon.

III. Conclusion
Possibly a star.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated UFO reports.

I. Description of Incident:
An Air Force major and enlisted personnel from this base observed a green object which a trail of sparks traveling downward at a high rate of speed and disappearing behind the horizon. The object was similar to that of the moon. Time of sighting was 1910 local time and the existing weather conditions were generally good.

II. Discussion of Incident:
Project Blue Book's contract astronomer is of the opinion that the object seen was probably an overestimated meteor. Two factors substantiate the meteor conclusion in this case: 1) the fact that it followed a downward course and 2) that it gave off sparks, two characteristics of a meteor. No length of observation was given that would rule this explanation.

III. Conclusion:
Probably a meteor.
