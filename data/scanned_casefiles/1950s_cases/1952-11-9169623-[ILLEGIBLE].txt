SOME STATEMENT

10 November 1952

I, Albert F. Radford, A/1C, USAF, AF28191367 of the 767th ACWN Squadron on November 8, 1952 was on scope #1 in operations between 1800 and 1900 MST. I noticed a blip at 1305 on the scope at 14th degrees at 97 miles. The speed was about 6 miles per sweep. The blip was painting eight to ten degrees across. It was perpendicular to our station. I believed it to be interesting and reported it to the crew chief. "The blip went into about 45 miles from the station on the same azimuth and disappeared. About a minute later it reappeared at the same azimuth at 97 miles. At the same speed it was into 1/2 miles again. This time it only faded for a couple of sweeps and then reappeared at about 60 miles going out. The Tech-rep changed no daring this time. When he did the blip decreased to about two degrees across. The lost contact with the object at about 66 miles. I have had a year and a half of experience in Radar Operations. I have been a scope operator for four months with the 767th ACWN Squadron.

Opheim, Montana

CORE 319.1                                                4 December 1952

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Objects

TO:     Chief, Air Technical Intelligence Center
        ATTN: ATIC-20
        Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

1. In reference to your letter of 13 November 1952, file ATIC-5, subject as above, AF Form 112 is not available at this station and efforts to obtain same from our support base have met with only partial success, in that only a part of the form is available. Therefore the information requested is set forth in the following paragraphs:

2. The objects were sighted by Mr. [REDACTED], an observer with the U.S. Weather Bureau office there. His observation was made on 12 November 1952 at 0243 hours (MST) while he was taking scheduled wind-drift measurements using balloon and theodolite. He first noticed a faint bluish-white light coming toward him from the northwest. At it got closer he could see the light was the glow from what appeared to be five (5) oval-shaped objects traveling in a V formation. They seemed to be about 20 to 50 feet in diameter with no trails or contrails. He heard no noise whatsoever. He estimated their speed as "that of fast jets" and the altitude at from two to three thousand feet. As they approached the edge of Glasgow, they made a sharp turn to the right (approximately 90 degrees) and continued in a southwest direction. The two outside objects seemed to bank and move out of formation a little. Estimated distance from observer to objects at the closest point was one mile. Point of observation was from the roof of the First National Bank Building in Glasgow.

3. There was a thin overcast at the time, and while Mr. [REDACTED] said it could possibly be light reflecting off the clouds, he would swear that it was something different.

4. Inquiry was made around Glasgow as to the integrity of Mr. [REDACTED], and as a result it is believed that he would not be the type to just "dream up" a story of this nature.

Unidentified Objects, dated 4 Dec 52.

5. It is not felt that there was any connection between the
visual sighting and our electronic pick-up at the time. Although
we had a track as about the same time, it was traveling east and
exhibited nothing unusual in the way of speed or sudden change of
direction. The visual sighting came from the northwest and dis-
appeared to the southwest.

6. Completed ATIC Form 332 is enclosed as requested. Also
enclosed is a road map on which has been indicated the approximate
path of the objects, as well as the position of the observer and
the relative position of this station with the point of observation.

COMMENTS (use reverse, if necessary)

1. Mr. [redacted] sightings were evaluated as "possible balloons".

2. There is a U. S. Weather Bureau Balloon-launching site in Sacramento which possibly launched a balloon November 15, 1952 just prior to his sighting.

3. In L.A. [redacted] May 20, 1953, sighting in Los Angeles. He states this object descended and came to rest directly over his head at an altitude of five feet. We are sure it is at least five feet tall, give or take a couple of inches, in which case it would have been sitting on his head. The object remained motionless for about five minutes at this altitude. It was described as the exact size of a "night football". It must not have frightened him because it wasn't reported until the latter part of 1954.

Here is the text I can extract from the image:

Land Area: 146,131 sq. miles. Water Area: 666 sq. miles. State Flower: Bitterroot.

WYOMING - Admitted to the Union, July, 1890

The image appears to be a detailed road map of Wyoming, showing various highways, county boundaries, reservoirs (such as Fort Peck Reservoir), and what seem to be Indian Reservations. The map is black and white and contains numerous road lines, town names, and geographical features.


- page 25 -

This appears to be a detailed map or grid system, with numerous interconnected lines and rectangular sections. While there are some small text labels visible at various points, most of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly. The map looks like a complex road or survey grid, with numerous intersections marked by small circles. The image is in black and white and appears to be a technical or administrative document from the 1950s.

1. The following information was received from the 60th Air Base Squadron, 
ATLN-MATS, Dover Air Force Base, Dover, Delaware. The date of the information 
was 15 November 1952.

a. "At 1855 EST, Saturday, 15 November 1952, 1st Lt. Joseph W. Blair, the 
Officer of the Day, received a phone call from Mr. [REDACTED], a civilian 
who was north of Bowers Beach Highway about three (3) miles north of 
Frederica, Delaware.

b. "Mr. [REDACTED] reported that he was observing an unidentified flying 
object approximately to be a white (HOT) object with an altitude with alternating red, white, and green lights rotating clockwise in a circle, in an area 
approximately four (4) miles north of Frederica, Delaware.

c. "In order to verify the existence of this object, Mr. [REDACTED] had 
immediately called a friend, Mr. [REDACTED], who resides in Frederica and therefore was aware of the scene. Mr. [REDACTED] and his wife, from directions given by 
Mr. [REDACTED], located the object and proceeded to make their observations. The 
witnesses observed the object as emitting a deep orange glow with faint white 
lights, with faint white smoke around it." They reported the object as being southwest of Frederica.

d. "The object was observed by Mr. [REDACTED] for about ten (10) minutes at 
which time it was hovering, it was then moved in the horizon, and also 
bigger than any star existing in the sides." Mr. [REDACTED] claims the object appeared 
to stay in the same position for three (3) or four (4) minutes, becoming lower on 
the horizon, growing fainter, then disappearing suddenly.

e. "Relating weather at the time of the report was six hundred (600) feet 
scattered, five thousand (5000) feet overcast, with seven (7) mile visibility. There 
was no air traffic in the vicinity of the sighting at that time."

Nov 18th, 1952

On or about 6.45 P.M. on the 15th of November, 1952. I noticed something in the sky about four miles South of Hawthorne which would first give off a red light then a white light thin or green light. These lights rotated in a clockwise direction. 24 were identical to one spotted like one at 200 ft. apparent over airline in the middle of the summer. I called up the Officer of the Day at P.I. on the Force Base and reported what I had seen. I watched this thing move in the sky for about ten minutes. I did not move or phone it was not an airplane. I called a friend of mine, Wallace Watkins, who lives in Hawthorne, and told him what to look and give me position from his home of this light. He saw the light and gave a South Hawthorne from the Hawthorne. After reporting this to the Officer Hills. Day I looked again and it had disappeared. This was the lowest light in the sky and was bigger than any star visible in the skies.

This is a description of three that I have spotted. They all looked the same.

The first one spotted at about two hundred feet high looked like it was out of control.

Nov. 18, 1952

About 6:45 on the evening of the 15th of November, my friend, called me on the phone and asked me to take a look at an object in the sky in the southwest. I located the object fairly low now the horizon which was of very dark with no luster. I lined it up with as part on the ground if it were in any direction. It did not I appeared to stay in the same position for three or four minutes getting lower in the horizon. It grew fainter, then disappeared suddenly. While I observed, it seemed to be a deep orange glow with intermittent white light, with faint white smoke around it.

There was no fog or any other airplane in the sky at the time.

CASE #2:

Major [REDACTED] retired, sent a letter on 26 Jan 53 to ATIC describing an incident. A film was submitted by True Magazine via [REDACTED] in accordance with an agreement that the Air Force would analyze the film, make 2 copies, and give its opinion, within security limits, to [REDACTED] owner of the film. The film submitted was approximately 50' of 8 mm color film of unidentified aerial objects taken near Landrum, South Carolina, on 16 November 1952. Mr. [REDACTED], Air Force Press Desk, has promised True, during conversations with Mr. Keyhoe, that no publicity will be given this film without Mr. [REDACTED] permission and that no copies will be shown to anyone but representatives of True (except, of course, Air Force personnel).

The following dispatch was incorporated into the data submitted by Major [REDACTED] within [REDACTED] letters. This data concerns the object which McLean photographed.

Dispatch is dated 16 November 1953, Florence, South Carolina. Dispatch states that "could hundred converts ... including an official of CAA" shortly after 5 o'clock this afternoon a shiny object was reported in the skies west of Florence. It slowly circled to the SW and then disappeared. [REDACTED], aircraft communicator for the CAA, watched the object for 6 minutes and described it as first appearing in the W at about 10,000' and slowly moving to the SW before disappearing. He said the object was glowing extremely brightly and likened its shape to a saucer tilted at an angle of about 30° with the thin edge down and heavier lip up. He said he heard no sound and saw no smoke. Mr. [REDACTED] was a aircraft communicator for the CAA for 11 years and a licensed pilot at the time of sighting. Ellis added that a check with Shaw AFB showed no jet aircraft aloft in the vicinity. He also added that the CAA station at Lumberton had reported sighting an object. No such incident in files of ATIC.

Dear Sir,

On April 24, 1953, I received from the Department of Defense a letter concerning certain film which showed several unidentified flying objects. For your convenience, I am enclosing a copy of your letter of April 24, 1953.

In your letter you indicate that "a cursory examination of the film revealed little of interest, however the film will later be given a thorough analysis and you will be advised of the results." I wish to call your attention to the fact that I have not been advised of the results of your examination of my film, as you promised. I feel that since I gave consideration to your interest that the least that you can do is fulfill the promise contained in your original letter of April 24, 1953.

Since you have had my film for approximately one year, I feel that you have had ample time in which to examine and evaluate it; therefore, if your use of my film is completed, I shall appreciate your returning it to me at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
s/C[REDACTED]

1. Attached is a roll of film that was requested by your office that could be returned to Mr. McLean. The following analysis may be used if you desire in your answer letter.

2. The Air Force does not attach significance to these pictures because:
    a. Only a few frames contain anything that is discernible.
    b. No movement of any object could be seen.
    c. On the frames that something could be seen there were two blobs of bright light, apparently reflected from the sun. In that the films were taken at dusk and the sun was setting from the clouds, it is believed the light spots indicated in the film are reflections from the sun. This phenomena is sometimes called "mock sun" or "sun dog".

Page 2a, Data A. Air Force to accompany 8 mm film of unidentified aerial objects, taken near Landrum, S.C., Nov. 16, 1952.

Dear Bob:

I promised to write you about the flying saucers we saw a couple of Sundays ago, so here goes. We were returning from down around Spartanburg and were traveling in a northerly direction, that is toward Tryon, when I happened to look out of the car window in a westerly direction and then I saw, almost jumped out of my skin in my excitement, and David [ILLEGIBLE] Jr., who took the picture, immediately pulled his Lincoln upon on the shoulder of the road and we all got out with the exception of his aunt, a blaze old lady from N.Y. who just couldn't be bothered.

When I first observed them they were strung across the western horizon in this fashion:

When I glimpsed them first they were about the size of a conventional automobile tire and were the color of aluminum. I could not observe any forward speed at any time, but did get the impression that they were traveling in a westerly direction, that is, away from us, and I have this to back that, that they diminished in size, from that of any auto tire to about the size of a tennis ball.

They did, however, show a definite north to south movement at times. At other times one would go straight up like an elevator while another would show a like downward descent. This up and down movement was quite marked both in speed and visibility. Some times several would disappear and at times we could see varying numbers of them although we never saw more than several at one time. The color when first seen by me was burnished silver which gradually changed to a burning orange. There was no noise, due no doubt to the great distance, nor were there any vapor trails to be seen.

I tried to view them objectively and attempted to keep a proper sequence in my mind. I repeatedly, while looking at them, would ask [ILLEGIBLE] apparently Mrs. [ILLEGIBLE] for their impressions which in each event would agree with what I was seeing. As you know [ILLEGIBLE] was his little 8 m Bell and Howell and attempted to take movies of them. As the light was fast fading, the timing being 5 about 5:15, he opened it as wide as he could, F 3.5 stop. I do hope they come out good and it he has any luck will send them on to you. You can get some camera store to run them off for you.

As you know, I have been most skeptical of these things. But I can say now with all sincerity, I am converted and no amount of rational log can shake me think otherwise, as I am convinced I have seen something the likes of which I have never seen before.

No corroborative what we saw, but I had only to look up the Charlotte Observer Monday's edition to read an article about the same things being observed over Anderson and Marion, S.C. at the same time we were seeing them over our vicinity. In as much as the article stated the switchboards were swamped at the places mentioned, also the air base at Greenville, S.C. I made no attempt to make any sort of a report. I did attempt to tell Vining, the editor of this little sheet here, but he went into [ILLEGIBLE]

Second letter:

Tryon, N.C., 1 - 8 - 53.

Dear [ILLEGIBLE]

Just finished your letter and am glad something might come
of the "saucer" pictures. In regards to the data you request about
the "saucers." The following is about what happened. We sighted
the objects in the sky on the 16th of Nov. 1952, at 5:15 in the
afternoon. I am positive as the time of day as I glanced at
watch at the time, so there is no argument that point.

The weather was clear where we were standing but off to the
west on the horizon there was a sign the objects were a few
broken clouds, enough to give us some color in the sunset. When I
first saw the saucers they were eleven (11) in number and were
interlocked out exactly like a string of beads, and appeared as
large as an automobile hub cap. As I stated previously, one would
leave its formation and ascent straight up while another would do
the exact opposite and descend downward.

Tie ascending and descending saucer made an abrupt right
angle turn in leaving the formation. We are no time saw more than
eleven objects and no loss than four. I am convinced had not
David Bunch taken off the telescopic lens we would have captured
the whole sequence of same events.

I would judge the time element, that is, the time we were
able to view them, was in the neighborhood of twelve minutes. I
observed no variation in altitude the entire time but I did get
the impression they were traveling in an east to west direction
and I base that on the fact that when first seen they were about
sizes of the hub caps on my Ford and when we finally lost them
over the hills - here were no aircraft visible at the time and I remember reading the Charlotte
Observer the next day, Nov. 17, 1952, at which time the same
objects were reported sighted over Anderson, S.C. and Marion. The
article went on to say they were sighted over the two places at
exactly the same time we saw them, Sunday, Nov. 16, 1952, at
5:15 pm. and that the switchboards were swamped with inquiries and
that upon checking the various service bases no planes were in the
air at that time.

Trust this is about what you want. Will get this off
in the mail special delivery.
All my love to [ILLEGIBLE] and [ILLEGIBLE]
As ever, [ILLEGIBLE]

Big Saucer Over Marion

Nichols, Marion, S.C. Nov. 16 - Police chief of police at Nichols, near here, said tonight he had received more than a score of telephone calls from people seeking information about an unidentified object sighted in the sky west of Nichols this afternoon. The object was sighted between 4:30 and 5 PM. Chief Epps said information indicated the object was silver, a color, about twice the size of a house, was whirling and rising at an angle.

Flying Saucer Spotted In Florence, S.C. Area

Florence, S.C. Nov. 16. AP. It's flying saucer time again and followers of that craze apparently have a couple of hundred converts here today, including an official of the CAA station. Shortly after 5 o'clock this afternoon, a shiny object was reported in the skies west of Florence. It slowly circled to the southeast and then disappeared. Telephone at the Florence Morning News were flooded with calls. So were those at the U.S. Weather Bureau station.

11 years, and a licensed pilot, said the aircraft communicator for the CAA for the first time, unlike anything I have ever seen. Ellis said that when he first saw the object, it was in the west at about 100, 000 feet and that it slowly moved to the southwest before disappearing. He added that he watched it for an estimated 15 to 20 minutes and emphatically thought that it was a jet aircraft or even a magnesium flare such as the type used by aircraft in large practice maneuvers. "It lasted too long and moved too slowly," he said.

The CAA official described the object as extremely brightly and likened its shape to a saucer tilted at an angle of about 30 degrees with a thin edge down and heavier lip up. He said the object was heard and saw no smoke.

Ellis added that a check with Shaw Air Force Base at Sumter CAA Jet aircraft aloft in vicinity also said the CAA station at Lumberton had reported sighting the object. 4 Marion motorists reported he saw it and tried to follow it toward Florence but lost sight of it over the Pee Dee River. A Sumter newspaper traveling toward Florence, stopped at the CAA office to say that he had seen the object in the sky toward D, llon and Mullins.

Page 2. Data for Air Force to accompany 8 mm film of unidentified aerial objects, taken near Landrum, S.C., Nov. 16, 1952.

Dear [ILLEGIBLE] (apparently nickname [ILLEGIBLE])

I promised to write you about the flying saucers we saw a couple of Sundays ago, so here goes. We were returning from down around Spartansburg area and were traveling in a northerly direction, that is toward Tryon, when I happened to look out of the car window in a westerly direction and then I saw them. I almost jumped out of my skin in my excitement, and [ILLEGIBLE], who took the pictures) immediately pulled his Lincoln up on the shoulder of the road and we all got out with the exception of his aunt, a blase old lady from N.Y. who just couldn't be bothered.

When I first observed them they were strung across the western horizon in this fashion:

When I glimpsed them first they were about the size of a conventional automobile tire and were the color of aluminum. I could not observe any forward speed at any time, but I did get the impression that they were traveling in a westerly direction, that is, away from us, and I have this on the fact that they diminished in size, from that of an auto tire to about the size of a tennis ball.

They did, however, show a definite north to south movement at times. At other times one would go straight up like an elevator while another would show a little downward descent. This up and down movement was quite marked both in speed and visibility. Some times several would disappear and at times we could see varying numbers of them although we never saw more than eleven and never less than three. The color when first seen by me was burnished silver which gradually changed to a burning orange. There was no noise, due no doubt to the great distance, nor were there any vapor trails to be seen.

I tried to view them objectively and attempted to keep a proper sequence in my mind. I repeatedly, while looking at them, would ask [ILLEGIBLE] while his wife [ILLEGIBLE] for their impressions which in each event would agree with what I was seeing. As you know, [ILLEGIBLE] are camera bugs. [ILLEGIBLE] has his little 8 mm. Bell and Howell and attempted to take movies of them. As the light was fast fading, the time being about 5:15, he opened it as wide as he could, f 3.5 stop. I do hope they come out good and if he has any luck will send them on to you. You can get some camera store to run them off for you.

As you know, I have been most skeptical of these things. But I can say now will all sincerely, I am converted and no amount of rationalizing can make me think otherwise, as I am convinced I have seen something the likes of which I have never seen before.

To corroborate what we saw, I had only to pick up the Charlotte Observer

taken near Landrum, S.C. Nov. 18, 1952.

Monday's edition to read an article about the same things being observed over
Anderson and Marlon, S.C. at the same time were seeing them over our
vicinity. In as much as the article stated the switchboards were swamped at the
places mentioned, also the air base at Greenville,S.C. I made no attempt to
make any sort of a report. I did attempt to tell Viking, the editor of this little
sheet here, but he went into a dissertation about jet planes, layers of hot and
cold air. I wouldn't argue with him and let it go at that.

Wish you could have been along with me at the time. You would have
sure had an eye full -- something to remember for a long time to come.

Second letter:

Tryon, N.C., 1 - 8 - 53.

Dear [REDACTED]

Just finished your letter and am glad something might come of the
"saucer" pictures. In regards to the data you request about the "saucers:"
The following is about what happened. We sighted the objects in the sky on the
10th of Nov. 1952, at 5:15 in the afternoon. I am positive as the time of day as
I glanced at my watch at the time, so there is no arguing this point.

The weather was clear where we were standing but off to the west on the
horizon where we sighted the objects there were a few broken clouds, enough
to give us some color in the sunset. When I first saw the saucers they were
eleven (11) in number and were stretched out exactly like a string of beads, and
appeared as large as an automobile hub cap. As I stated previously, one would
leave its formation and ascend straight up while another would do the exact
opposite and descend downward.

The ascending and descending saucer made an abrupt right angle turn
in leaving the formation. We at no time saw more than eleven objects and less
than four. I am convinced had not [ILLEGIBLE] taken off the telescopic lens we
would have captured the whole sequence of events.

I would judge the time element, that is, the time we were able to view
the, was in the neighborhood of twelve minutes. I observed no variation in
altitude the entire time but I did get the impression they were traveling in an east
to west direction and I base that on the fact that when first seen they would about
size of the hub caps on my Ford and when we finally lost them to view they were
about the size of tennis balls. There were no aircraft visible at the time and I

I remember reading the Charlotte Observer the next day, Nov. 17, 1952, at which time the same objects were sighted over Anderson, S.C. and Marlon. The article went on to say they were sighted over the two places at exactly the same time we saw them, Sunday, Nov. 16, 1952, at 5:15 pm. and that the switchboards were swamped with inquiries and that upon checking the various service bases no planes were in the air at that time.

Copy of two items in the Charlotte Observer, Nov. 17, 1952:

Page 1, lower right corner:

Big Saucer over Marlon
H.E. Epps, chief of police at Nichols, near here, said tonight he had received more than a score of telephone calls from people seeking information about an unidentified object sighted in the sky west of Nichols this afternoon. The object was sighted between 4:30 and 5 pm. Chief Epps said information indicated the object was silver in color, about twice the size of a house, was whirling and rising at an angle.

Flying Saucer Spotted in Florence, S.C., Area
Florence, S.C. Nov. 16. AP. It's flying saucer time again and followers of that craze apparently have a couple of hundred converts here today, including an official of the CAA station. Shortly after 5 o'clock this afternoon, a shiny object was reported in the skies west of Florence. It slowly circled to the southwest and then disappeared. Telephones at the Florence Morning News were flooded with calls. So were those at the U.S. Weather Bureau station and the CAA offices at the Municipal airport.

Aircraft communicator for the CAA for 11 years, and a licensed pilot, said the object was "unlike anything I have ever seen." Ellis said that when he first saw the object it was in the west at about 10,000 feet and that it slowly moved to the southwest before disappearing. He added that he watched it for six minutes which dispelled an earlier thought that it was a jet aircraft or even a magnesium flare such as the type used by aircraft in target practice. "It lasted too long and moved too slowly," he said.

The CAA official described the object as glowing extremely brightly and likened its shape to a saucer tilted at an angle of about 30 degrees with a thin edge down and heavier lip up. He said he heard no sound and saw no smoke.

[ILLEGIBLE] added that a check with Shaw Air Force Base at Sumter showed no jet aircraft aloft in the vicinity. He also said that the CAA station at Lumberton had reported sighting the object. A Marlon motorist reported he saw it and tried to follow it toward Florence but lost sight of it over the Pee Dee River.

A Sumter newpaperman traveling toward Florence, stopped at the CAA office to say that he had seen the object in the sky toward Dillon and Mullins.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DIR/INT, NBAC                                                  TR-63-52                PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

1. The following information and testimonies were furnished by the Commanding Officer of McAndrew AFB on the sighting of an unidentified object.

2. On 15 November 1952 between the hours of 2000Z and 0230Z an unidentified object was sighted by the station personnel of McAndrew AFB, 471°N/5350W. Eye witness accounts will be described in the following paragraphs.

3. Testimony of T/Sgt:
"The direction of flight of the object sighted came from the southwest and then made a sharp turn west. Immediately after the change of course, it made a bounding or skipping motion, applied southwest again and then started to climb into the southwest. It appeared to be a star at first, but all of a sudden I had a feeling it was coming toward me, so I closed my hands before my face. I estimated the size of the object to be that of a grapefruit. When it made its turn to the west, then angling off to the southwest, it gave off a brilliant explosion light. It also appeared to have broken red and blue lines about it in an eye shape. Unable to estimate altitude, but it appeared to be three (3) miles away. No jet or rocket streams was observed. Estimated speed was between 600 and 700 miles an hour. Duration of observation was between 5 and 6 seconds."

4. Testimony of Lt. (object was sighted on the way to meet an incoming aircraft):
"I noticed a large brilliant object approximately the size of a grapefruit intensely white, tinged with red, approaching McAndrew AFB, from the southwest. I first noticed this object heading for the flight line with a terrific speed (estimated 300-400 mph). When I was leaving the Marine Gate of Argentia Naval Station, I approached and I assumed 1½ was a Jet, though I had never seen a jet with a white afterglow. I stopped the vehicle, turned off the ignition and watched the object. From the running board, it appeared to have an altitude of 4000 to 5000 feet and when nearly overhead, with no noise, made a flat 90 degree turn to southwest and disappeared in that direction with an undulating motion like a bobbing cork at a very high speed. Object was sighted at 0015Z."

5. Interview of A/2C who was at the Flight Line, Argentia Naval Station at approximately 2000Z:
He sighted an object over Placentia Bay 471°N/5350W, moving in a northly direction toward Placentia Peak which is directly west of the Flight Line about 1½ miles away. Estimated speed 150 to 200 mph, altitude unknown. The object hailed in what appeared to be the area of Placentia for about 20 minutes before disappearing. He believed it dropped to earth. The object was nearly completely orange in color. As observed from the ground the object looked like a straight line about one foot long. The object kept blinking frequently and then stopped blinking for approximately five (5) seconds and then started again. Object was sighted from 2000Z to 2040Z.

6. Testimony of S/Sgt from Newfoundland AFB on a flight from Westover AFB to Argentia:
"I observed a shooting star in flight between Copper Lake and Sydney, Nova Scotia, approximately 2400Z. It appeared to make an arc."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det 1, 600th AIS, APO 970                52-350                Page 2 of 4 Pages

On 16 November 1952, 1st Lt Lyons & Sams, Usaf, and 1st Richard T
Barnard, USAF the Gila (Sic) Tac Gn, GLYNCO, Central Group, were inter-
viewed with regard to the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

At 1305L 15 November 1952, Lt Base, pilot, and Lt Barnard, observer, were
flying a combat mission in a T-6 aircraft over the central sector of the friendly
main line of resistance. At the time cited, it Base was flying in the vicinity
of CT795AB at 130 miles per hour indicated air speed, 10,500 feet, indicated
altitude and in a northerly direction. The weather conditions were clear, with
visibility from 15 to 20 miles. The sea at this time of day is in a south, south
westerly position from the incident area. Winds at 10,000 feet were generally
from 240 degrees with velocities up to 20 miles per hour.

Lt Base first noted the unidentified object moving north, apparently close
to the terrain. The sighting (points A on attached map overlay) was originally
made against the slopes of Osang-San (Papa-San) at CT654455. The object, initially
discovered by Lt Base as an aircraft, moved approximately five (5) miles and
then turned south and gained altitude. At the same time the T-6 aircraft, was
orbiting near the Central Control waiting the arrival of fighter bombers which they were
to control in a strike. When the T-6 aircraft was at point A2 as indicated in the
map overlay, it Base again sighted the object and identified it as not being an
aircraft. This sighting was to the right of the T-6, at an estimated 1000-1200
yards. Lt Base described it as spherical in shape, silver in color and approxi-
mately 8-10 feet in diameter. He further described the object as lacking any
visible means of propulsion and having no protrusions of any sort. The surface
was smooth.

When Lt Base saw the object, which was moving at approximately the same speed
as the aircraft, he turned the aircraft towards it slightly at which time the
object headed south and began climbing at a high rate of speed, turning into a
left orbit around the aircraft. Lt Base called the object to the attention of
Lt Barnard who saw it as it went into it's left hand orbit.

He first saw the object at the ten o'clock level position. Lt Barnard
differs with the pilot on one point, as to distance, in that he estimates the
minimum distance of sighting to be from 500 to 1,000 yards. (Closer to the latter).

In explanation for the difference between the estimates of minimum distance
of the sighting, Lt Barnard suggests that he did not see the object till it was
to the left of the aircraft and that the pilot, initially observed it at the same
altitude when the object was to the right of the aircraft.

Lt Barnard's description of the object was that it was a silver spherical
object, approximately the size of a man's thumb nail held at extended arms length.
He further described the object as "shimmering" and having a "halo" which surrounded the object. The halo was only of halving thickness. He further stated that
the shimmering effect appeared to be more apparent when the object was between
the aircraft and the general direction of the sun. The object appeared to Lt
Barnard as being darker at the edges, as a translucent sphere would appear when
held up to a light.

That the object was turning in a left hand orbit about a central point, with
the aircraft flying a tighter circle within the path of the object, was confirmed
by both men. The diameter of the circle caused by the object in it's path
appeared to increase as it moved. After the first complete circle the object
began to climb more rapidly, and continued increasing the radius of its circle.

The altitude and full description of the object and its actions were described by the pilot, by radio to "Mosquito Godfrey" a ground control, during the sighting.

The object circling three times to the left in a disaster ranging from 100 to 1000 yards was considerably altitude, and then noted off at what both sources estimated to be 500 to 600 miles per hour in a south westerly direction towards the sun. It was estimated the object was at approximately 16,000 feet when it was first seen. At 12 miles range with the naked eye. Lt Bernard was government issue greenish brown glasses.

No optical device was used. The entire sighting extended over a period of 5 to 7 minutes, from 1345 to 1352. The object was viewed against various colored backgrounds, the dark terrain, and blue sky and white clouds. It remained constant as to shape, size, and color.

Both sources state that the general motion of the object was steady and gave the impression of controlled flight. They stated that it did not appear to be moving on the masses of air currents.

The pilot had flown 54 missions in this theater and the observer had flown 48 missions.

Statements obtained and are attached to this report, along with the letter forwarded by the Intelligence Officer, 6147th Tactical Control Group, map overlay of the area, which indicates the approximate flight path of the object and the aircraft, and a drawing of the object, as seen by Lt Bernard. The statements especially that of Lt Bernard, are complete in that they include the points as covered in the several debriefings they received.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. Both sources are considered to be competent observers and sightings reported by them are considered reliable. Both officers gave exact information and during the interview were certain on all points of the observation. Lt Bernard, gave considerable detail in his detailed statement which is referred to in the extensive statement that he applied to supplement this report.

2. During the inquiry conducted by the investigating officer, Lt Bass indicated verbally that during his radio contact with Mosquito Godfrey, they reported that no other object besides their aircraft was picked up by the radar covering that sector.

3. Lt Col Andrew Payton, Operations Officer, 30th Weather Squadron was contacted. He stated that the only weather station maintained by the Air Force in that area was at Chiple-21 GT5222, however the largest weather balloon utilized by this unit is a 30 gram "ceiling" balloon with little possibility of a 12 in. diameter. He further stated that there were no weather balloons of any size performing as the object is reported doing under the prevailing conditions.

4. At Tokchang, Korea, C55009, approximately south west of the area in which the object was sighted, the 1st Artillery Observation Battalion, an army light plane unit, maintains a meteorological station. The officer in charge, Warrant Officer Larry Madden, stated that at 1257H on 15 November, 150 gram

The balloon released was a natural latex (white) color. The rate of ascent on this size balloon is approximately 1200 feet per minute. Major Decker of the Headquarters, Fifth Air Force, Weather Station, stated upon questioning, that at 10,000 feet a 350 gram, natural, medium, and experimental shape, unless one part of the balloon was weaker and should therefore bulge.

5. It is possible that the unidentified object could have been this 350 gram balloon.

D/F TEAM Comments:

1. The 350 gram balloon released 50 minutes previous to the sighting would not be expected to be an eye-catching object at the time of the sighting unless it were leaking, (which would preclude the rapid climb described).

2. There have obviously been a number of unidentified sightings in the CE and DE grid areas of Korea. Of these, at least 5 sightings have tentatively been identified as army balloons.

3. Vectoring as airspeed on a free balloon is actually difficult, and false impressions of rapid movement can easily be made. From the available information 15 appears than the object, probably a balloon, and possibly one launched by Eighth Army troops.

In compliance with FAF Letter AG 350.07, dated 5 March 1952 and in conjunction with investigation by GOOKIN ARDS, the following report is submitted:

1. Object was first sighted flying near one or more other aircraft of 6497th (CT 65443). Object was flying, appeared to be translucent. There was no visible means of propulsion though the object appeared to be under control. There were no aerodynamic features identifiable. Size of object was estimated by pilot to be from 8 to 10 feet in diameter. Object was heading North then turned and headed due South towards Kunsan Air Field. It circled to last, crossing Kunsan, at speeds ranging from 100 MPH (Estimate) to 700-800 MPH (Estimated). Object was last observed at approximately 16:000 feet, heading into object.

2. Object was under observation for approximately 5 to 7 minutes from 13:54 to 13:54.

3. Observation was visual; air to air from a T-6 aircraft flying at 10,500 feet, 250 miles per hour. In an orbit 1 left. Air Force also can plainly verify the observation. No optical devices were used.

4. Object was at CT 65443 on initial sighting; flying close to the ground, in film toward observer in the vicinity of CT 7754 coming within 100 yards, according to pilot.

5. Pilot was First Lieutenant Lyten S. Bass who has flown 54 missions in Korea and the observer was First Lieutenant Richard L. Barnard who has flown 48 missions as a Mosquito observer. Observations of both are accepted as completely reliable.

On 15 November 1952, 1st Lt Layton S Bass, USAF, and 1st Lt Richard I Barnard, USA of the 619th Tac Con Sq, 6147th Tactical Control Group, were interviewed with regard to the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

At 1345, 15 November 1952, Lt Bass, pilot, and Lt Barnard, observer, were flying a combat mission in a T-6 aircraft over the central sector of the friendly main line of resistance. At the time cited, Lt Bass was flying in the vicinity of CT779515 at 150 miles per hour indicated air speed, 10,500 feet, indicated altitude and in a northerly direction. The weather conditions were clear, with visibility from 15 to 20 miles. The sun at this time of day is in a south, southwest position from the incident area. Winds at 10,000 feet were generally from 20 degrees with velocities up to 20 miles per hour.

Lt Bass first noted the unidentified object moving north, apparently close to the terrain. The sighting (points #1 on attached map overlay) was originally made against the slope of Osang-San (Papa-san) at CT654455. The object, initially dismissed by Lt Bass as an aircraft, moved north approximately five (5) miles and then turned south and gained altitude. At the same time the T-6 aircraft, as orbiting "Ash can Control" awaiting the arrival of fighter bombers which they were to control in a strike, again sighted the T-6 aircraft was at point #2 as indicated in the map overlay. Lt Bass again sighted the object and identified it as not being an aircraft. This sighting was to the right of the T-6, at an estimated 100-200 yards. Lt Bass described it as spherical in shape, silver in color and approximately 8-10 feet in diameter. He further described the object as lacking any visible means of propulsion and having no protrusions of any sort. The surface was smooth. There was no audible sound.

When Lt Bass saw the object, which was moving at approximately the same speed as the aircraft, he turned the aircraft towards it slightly at which time the object headed south and began climbing at a high rate of speed, turning into a left orbit around the aircraft. Lt Bass called the object to the attention of Lt Barnard who saw it as it went into its left hand orbit.

He first saw the object at the ten o'clock level position. It Barnard first saw the pilot on one point, a to ten distances, in that he estimates the minimum distance of sighting to be from 500 to 1,000 yards. (Closer to the latter).

In explanation for the difference between the estimates of minimum distance of the sighting, Lt Barnard suggests that he did not see the object till it was to the left of the aircraft and that the pilot initially observed it at the same altitude when the object was to the right of the aircraft.

Lt Barnard's description of the object was that it is a silver spherical object, approximately the same size as a man's thumb held at extended arm's length. He further described the object as "shimmering" and having a "halo" which surrounded the object. The halo was only of hairline thickness. He further stated that the shimmering effect appeared to be more apparent when the object was between the aircraft and the general direction of the sun. The object appeared to Lt Barnard as being darker at the edges, as a translucent sphere would appear when held up to a light.

That the object was turning in a left hand orbit about a central point, with the aircraft flying a tighter circle within the path of the object, was confirmed by both sources. The diameter of the circle marked by the object in its path appeared to increase as it moved. After the first complete circle the object began to climb more rapidly, and continued increasing the radius of its circles.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: (Agency)                REPORT NO.    52-350         PAGE    3 of 4    PAGES

Det 1, 600th AISS, APO 970

The altitude and full description of the object and it's actions were described by the pilots, by radio to "Mosquito Control", a ground control, during the sighting.

The object circling three times to the left in a diameter ranging from 100 to 1000 yards gained considerable altitude, and then moved off at what both sources estimated to be 500 to 600 miles per hour in a south westerly direction towards the sun. Lt Bass apparently 16,000 feet when it was lost by both observers in the glare near the sun. It was made the entire observation with the naked eye. Lt Barnard wore government issue greenish brown glasses.

No optical device was used. The entire sighting extended over a period of 5 to 7 minutes, from 1345I to 1352I. The object was viewed against various colored backgrounds, the dark terrain, and blue sky and white clouds. It remained constant as to shape, size, and color.

Both sources state that the general motion of the object was steady and gave the impression of controlled flight. They stated that it did not appear to be moving on the motion of air-current.

The pilot had flown 54 missions in this theater and the observer had flown 48 missions.

Statements were obtained and are attached to this report, along with the letter forwarded by the Intelligence Officer, 614th Tactical Control Group, a map overlay of the area, which indicates the approximate flight path of the object and the aircraft, and a drawing of the object, as seen by Lt Barnard. The statements especially that of Lt Barnard, are complete in that they include the points as covered in the several debriefings they received.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. Both sources are considered to be competent observers and sightings reported by them are considered reliable. Both officers gave exact information with during the interview were certain on all points of the observation. Lt Barnard, gave considerable detail in his debriefing which is reflected in the extensive statement that he supplied to supplement this report.

2. During the inquiry conducted by the investigating officer, Lt Bass indicated verbally that during his radio contact with Mosquito Godfrey, they reported that no other object besides their aircraft was picked up by the radar covering that sector.

3. Lt Col Andrew Payton, Operations Officer, 30th Weather Squadron was contacted. He stated that the only weather station maintained by the Air Force in that area was at Chip'a-4 GT5222, however the largest weather balloon utilized by this unit is a 30 gram "ceiling" balloon with a maximum inflated size of 15 in. diameter. He further stated that there was little possibility of a weather balloon of any size performing as the object is reported doing under the prevailing conditions.

4. At Tokchong, Korea, C53089, approximately south west of the area in which the object was sighted, the last Artillery Observation Battalion, an army light plane unit, maintains a meteorological station. The officer in charge, (name redacted), stated that at 1257I on 15 November, 350-gram weather balloon was released.

The balloon released was a natural latex (white) color. The rate of ascent on this size balloon is approximately 1200 feet per minute. Major Docker of the Headquarters, Fifth Air Force, Weather Station, stated upon questioning, that at 10,000 feet a 350 gram balloon should maintain an approximate spherical shape unless one part of the balloon was weaker and should therefore bulge.

5. It is possible that the unidentified object could have been this 350 gram balloon.

D/F TPAT Comments:

1. The 350 gram balloon released 50 minutes previous to the sighting would not be expected to be at any visible altitude at the time of the incident unless it were leaking, (which would preclude the rapid climb described).

2. There have previously been a number of unidentified sightings in the CE and DE grid areas of Korea. Of these, at least 5 sightings have tentatively been identified as enemy balloons.

3. Vectoring an aircraft on a free balloon is actually difficult, and false impressions of rapid movement can easily be made. From the available information it appears that the object was probably a balloon, and possibly one launched by friendly army troops.

Subject: Statement of Unidentified Flying Object.

About the aim I do not care to venture an actual estimate; however, as an infantryman I am somewhat to estimating lateral measurements. Judging by the method, I have the impression that the apparent size of the object was about the size of a man's thumb nail when it was at its closest.

At this point it might be pertinent to note a possible explain for an apparent discrepancy between Lieutenant Bass's estimate of size and distance by pointing out that he saw the object considerably before I did. He states that at one time the object was approximately 100 yards off our right wing, but this must undoubtedly have been before he directed my attention to it. Because as no time while I had it in sight was it anywhere to our right side. I had to turn my head sometimes toward the front and sometimes toward the rear of the plane to keep the object in view, but always toward the left hand side.

When I first spotted the object it was in a position which I described to Lieutenant Bass as "10 o'clock level" (in order confirm my belief that this was the object he had referred to in his initial comment), but of course this was an approximate description. It was actually somewhat lower, climbing somewhat on the horizon. It climbed so approximately level with my heading in or general Southwest direction. We were turning toward it, which means that as it was traveling a slant height heading, the position could be to our right side. I now realize that, having the object on our left side, we were ahead and somewhat above it.

It continued to maintain pretty much the same position relative to us, which means that it was more or less with us. Meanwhile receding slowly, which signified that it was lengthening its radius of orbit. It then began to climb rapidly, continuing its orbit and continuing slowly to increase its radius. It continued this process for at least two and possibly three full cycles (it is difficult to be precise on this point).

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Bass, who had reported the sighting to Mosquito Godfrey as soon as I had confirmed it to him, was continuously describing the object and its actions on the radio, and I heard him estimate its altitude at very short intervals (certainly not over a minute space) successively as 12,000, 15,000, and finally 13,000 feet. At which time it was in a general Southwestern direction toward the general neighborhood of the sun. We lost sight of it in the glare area surrounding the sun. It was slightly north of the sun's position. I lost the object when I was wearing sunglasses, neither particularly clean or particularly dirty. Lieutenant Bass got glimpses and therefore doubtless lost sight.

STATEMENT                                                   19 November 1952

At 1345I hours, 15 November 1952, I was flying as an observer with Lieutenant Layton S. Bass. At this moment we were orbiting above Ash Cake Control at an indicated altitude of 10,500 feet, assisting the arrival of a flight of fighters which we were preparing to control in patching a strike. We were, steady, calm, alert, with hand units, and after reaching the mentioned altitude, continued to hold the altitude and the orbit. The time was the period checked as time over target for contacting the fighters was set for that hour, and was our close indicated the scheduled time. Lieutenant Bass contacted Ash Cake Control and was informed that as yet they had negative contact with the fighters.

Shortly after this moment, certainly less than a minute, Lieutenant Bass drew my attention to the object. I do not recall his exact words, but they were in the nature of a brief, momentous, general comment. Like "Look at that" or "Do you see that?" There was no suggestion of what he had reference to, and the direction in which he was looking was my only clue as to his location of the sighting. He was giving to left front, and immediately looked in the general direction. I sighted the object. It was an obvious sighting and seized my attention immediately. It was a silvery, glistening, apparently perfectly spherical object, with a slight haze or corona. The halo was not thick in comparison to the diameter of the object, being a mere hairline in apparent thickness, however, with a dot, or disc, however, in any way or at any point like the hard, sharp outline of the sphere's circumference.

The sphere itself was rather darker around the periphery than at the center, as a globe of translucent substance will appear when illuminated against a source of light. However, in the sighting was the object actually in direct line between us and the sun, and there was no other conceivable source of light at the time. The surface of the sphere seemed to be of a light, as if with reflected light. However, this shimmering appearance was, if anything, somewhat more apparent when the object was between us and the general direction of the sun, then presumably the sun would be shadowed, than it was when we were looking at it with the sun at our backs. The word "translucent" flashed into my mind spontaneously, almost immediately upon sighting it.

At the precise instant that I personally sighted it, it was, as I have said, off our left front, and was at that moment at the closest range that it was to be during my own personal sighting. I am unaccustomed to estimating distances beyond 1,000 yards, but I am inclined to believe, from my momentary first impression of the object in relation to the terrain that it was between 500 and 1,000 yards distant, probably closer to the latter figure.

Subject: Statement of Unidentified Flying Object.

Until the object left the orbit, it maintained an approximately uniform position in relation to us, varying a few degrees forward or aft of our left wing and, of course, higher as it began to climb. At one point it apparently had accelerated somewhat and its orbit, gained an arc so that I was looking backward at about 45 degrees, but Lieutenant Bass either opened up the controls of tightened our orbit, or both, so that we brought it back approximately inline with our 1st wing. I had deduced at the outset that it was following a larger orbit concentric with ours, and this impression was confirmed. We were evidently at opposite ends of the diameter, and the fact that we held our same relative positions for so long in spite of disparity of orbit bases is significant in regard to its speed. In order to maintain the same angular velocity in a much larger orbit, its linear velocity must have been greater in direct ratio to the circumference of the orbits.

I have not developed any skill in estimating speed of objects in the air, but under the circumstances Lieutenant Bass's estimates of 500-700 miles per hour appears to fall within an entirely reasonable range of magnitude. The fact that it kept reading indicator that it was increasing its orbit, therefore, must have been accelerating rather uniformly and smoothly to maintain its same relative position.

The motion of the sphere during the entire period of observation was smooth and forceful, devoid of any jerkiness, wiggling, wavering, bending, and there were no significant side or deflection of travel, which suggests influence by air currents. It is impossible for me, personally, to expect so much of an inanimate object, obeying the laws of physics, to act in such a manner with our intelligent, artificial control and direction. I have also considered the possibility of light refraction phenomena, although not a graduate physicist, I am familiar with the general principles of optics, and unless it can be scientifically proved otherwise, I refuse flatly to believe that any light refraction phenomena can present such uniformity and definiteness in its appearance, from such a tremendous variety of ranges, altitudes, angles of approach, and optical conditions, nor that its motion over such a period of time (5 to 7 minutes) could be so smooth and regular and lend itself so readily to an obvious theory of purposeful action.

It is worthwhile to point out, in this connection, that we saw the object against various background of dark mountains in the distance, blue sky, and clouds, and that its appearance, like that of a known material object, contrasted light against the terrain, relatively dark against the clouds, and shiny against the blue sky.

On one previous occasion, while flying with another pilot, I had seen what I believe may well have been a refraction phenomenon (I was unable to point it out to the pilot). It appeared as a bright speck against a distance dark cloud bank, and apparently stood motionless for several minutes, then suddenly took off on a Northerly heading at a terrific rate of speed.

Subject: Statement of Unidentified Flying Object.

This type of conduct from dead rest to instantaneous swift motion is possible for a light refraction phenomenon; but absolutely impossible for a material object possessing weight and mass. It is significant that the object observed by Lieutenant Base and myself performed no instantaneous radial changes of speed or direction; its motion was everywhere characteristic of a material object under intelligent control.

In conclusion, I would like to point out, for what ever weight is may give my observations, that in civil life, I was a professional time study and methods analyst, with four years practical experience in industry, and in the course of my duties I frequently had to describe, subsequently, in writing, observations which it was not practical to record at the time. I had also, at the time of this sighting, flow forty some minutes as a Westinghouse observer, and have necessarily learned to observe quickly and draw conclusions from my observations.

In compliance with FFAF Letter AG 350.07, dated 5 March 1952 and
in conjunction with investigation by 6004th AISS, the following report
of an Unidentified Object is submitted:

1. Object was first sighted flying near deck off reverse slope
of Papasan (CT 654455). Object was silver sphere and appeared to
be translucent. There was no visible means of propulsion though the
object appears to be under control. There were no aerodynamic features
nor identifying marks. Size of object was estimated by pilot to be
from 6 to 10 feet in diameter. Object was heading North then turned
and headed due South towards Mosquito aircraft. It orbited to left
around Mosquito three (3) times at a distance of 100 yards to 1000 yards
off right wing of Mosquito, at speed ranging from 100 MPS (Estimated) to
700-800 MPH (Estimated). Object was last observed at approximately
18,000 feet, heading into sun. No sound from object was heard.

2. Object was under observation for approximately 5 to 7 minutes
from 1345I to 1352I.

3. Observation was visual, air to air from a T-6 aircraft flying
at 10,500 feet, 130 miles per hour, in an orbit to left. Air Force
issue sun glasses worn by the observer. No optical devices were used.

4. Object was at CT 654455 on initial sighting, flying close to
the ground. It flew toward observer in the vicinity of CT 7754 coming
within 100 yard, according to pilot.

5. Pilot was First Lieutenant Layton S. Bass who has flown 54
missions in Korea and the observer was First Lieutenant Richard I.
Barnard who has flown 48 missions as a Mosquito observer. Observations
of both are accepted as completely reliable.

Dear Major Tucker:

A civilian investigator of UFOs states that he saw a letter from the Air Technical Intelligence Center, stating that a UFO was seen in the general vicinity of Desert Center, Calif. on November 20, 1958.

This is significant because it was at this time and place that Mr. Star Route, Valley Center, Calif., claimed to have met and conversed with a man who alighted from a "flying saucer", named "Orton".

In substantiating claims in his book, The Flying Saucers Have Landed, that pilots of the United States Air Force were informed of a UFO incident, he claims that the letter he has from ATIC, under date of August 5, 1958, is proof positive of his claims, and, consequently, refuses to believe any report, however good against the validity of this claim.

I would appreciate knowing all available details concerning the UFO report mentioned in ATIC's letter to Mr. [REDACTED]. I feel that it will do me good in clarifying it. I am enclosing ATIC letter for you to release to me the full details of the above-mentioned sighting, as contained in Project Bluebook file.

Sincerely,
[SIGNATURE REDACTED]

Dear Mr [redacted]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 26 September con-
cerning an Unidentified Flying Object sighting of 20 November
1952.

The only UFO sighting on that date which was reported to
the Air Force took place ten miles east of Salton Sea, Calif.
There were no other sightings reported on that date and the
Salton Sea sighting obviously has no connection with Mr.
Adamski's claims.

We do not have the facilities, funds, or personnel to
reproduce records for dissemination to private groups or
individuals. In lieu thereof, I am including the latest De-
partment of Defense press release on this subject.

Major Lawrence J. Tucker, USAF
Public Information Division

Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Major Tucker:

Thank you for your letters dated October 6, 1959 and October 14, 1959.

Re your October 6 letter: I would greatly appreciate all available details of the Salton Sea, Calif. UFO report of November 20, 1958. I would further like to know the opinion of the USAF on the claim of having met men from outer space and of having been taken for rides in flying saucers.

Thank you for the Press Release No. 798-59.

Re your October 14 letter: Thank you for sending me a copy of the latest AFR 200-2. I note that this regulation has been revised several times. I should like to know the reason for these revisions, and what is still cause for revision of any AFR? Are two other AFRs mentioned; they are AFR 95-7 and AFR 205-1. If these documents are not classified, may I have copies of them?

Would you know of any way at all that I could not least borrow a copy of JANAP 146 for a few days? As it is now I print "I realize the problem involved, but surely there is at least one copy in the dozens of USAF offices that could be loaned to me for a few days if none can be ported with permanently. I am not trying to poster you about this, but my UFO research will be greatly aided if I can read this document.

Is the statement that each UFO investigation costs the USAF $10,000.00 correct? It was attributed to an unnamed USAF spokesman during the UFO "flap" of November, 1957.

Also during November, 1957, a Colonel Dean Hess, USAF, apparently an associate of yours made a public demand that the AF seriously investigate UFOs, instead of brushing them off, as it had done in the past. This was reported by the Associated Press. The AP later carried a story about Col. Hess being reprimanded for saying what he did. Is it true that Col. Hess was reprimanded for this statement? If so, on what grounds was he reprimanded?

Yours for saucer research,

[Signature redacted]

SAFOI-*(Maj Tacker/mhb/T229)

30 October 1959

Dear [REDACTED]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 17 October 1959 concerning UFOs.

The United States Air Force records show a UFO sighting on 20 November 1952, ten miles east of Salton Sea in California. ATIC's conclusion in this case was that the pilot saw a weather balloon at approximately 16,000' altitude. There were other B-50 type aircraft in the air but none of the other pilots reported seeing a UFO. No radar reports of this sighting were received.

There is absolutely no connection between the Air Force sighting of 20 November 1952 and the popular science fiction writer, but he has never presented any proof of his claims to the USAF.

In answer to your other question, Air Force regulations and manuals are revised from time to time to reflect changes in procedure or policy. As requested, I am including AFR 95-7 and AFR 205-1.

As previously stated, the only way I know that you can read the JAMAP 146 is to visit this office.

The statement that each UFO investigation costs the USAF $10,000 is obviously incorrect. Naturally, each investigation would vary in cost based upon the circumstances surrounding the sighting and the extent of the investigation.

This Office has no knowledge of the statement attributed to Colonel Dean Hess or of a reprimand received by Colonel Hess as a result thereof.

Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER

PREPARED BY (Type): William H Blankfield, 2d Lt USAF

REPORT NO.: 2

DATE OF INFORMATION: 27 November 52

SOURCE: Interrogation of Eye Witnesses

SUMMARY (Type): 454TC003

INFORMATION COPY

1. The unidentified flying object was sighted in the vicinity of Fort Benning, Georgia at approximately 2120 hours on 21 November, 1952 when first seen it was of a bluish-white color and travelling a NNW direction but fading while a strange course. It turned to a dull orange color and disappeared from sight. It reappeared in approximately one minute and it had returned to its original color and in a position slightly to the East. At this time the object turned North and held this course for about two minutes and then turned to a South-South-East direction. It held a constant course until out of sight.

2. All observers seemed certain it was neither a meteor nor a weather balloon but none would venture an opinion as to what they thought the object was.

3. The weather was very good, with ceiling and visibility unlimited.

4. As far as can be ascertained by this Headquarters only five people saw this object.

"ONE of the German enterprises that were very active before the war and are now picking up again is the aeronautical research association attached to Aachen's Technical Universität."

"The association was formally responsible for several original designs of aircraft, including gliders, and many of its ideas are believed to have been incorporated in the building of Nazi fighter planes."

"Now the brains of the association have produced a design for a revolutionary type of aircraft which might look remarkably like popular conceptions of the mysterious flying saucer."

"The new design is shaped like a place with a large, round, hollow space in the middle; it has a rudderless steering system based upon air pressure which simultaneously regulates the climbing or descending speed of the aircraft."

"After tests with a model constructed from the original designs, experts of the research association say that it has great advantages in safety, compared with aircraft of traditional shape and design."

The following report was received from field grade officer assigned to this Activity:

While returning to White Sands Proving Ground from Wm Beaumont Hospital, at approximately 2030 hours on 25 November 1952, I observed what appeared to be flames, or pyrotechnics, on the right side of the road. My first thought was that these objects were flares that were being fired by troops on a night project. However, shortly thereafter—a matter of seconds—I observed what appeared to be a flame land right in the middle of the road, about three or four hundred yards distant.

It assumed the shape of a ball, having a green center, fading to a light hazy blue at the borders. This light disappeared before my car arrived at the spot. After observing this light, I thought that the Department of Army had a new type pyrotechnics that I was not familiar with they they were using on a mix problem. Approximately three to five minutes later I observed a light, or series of lights, approaching from the right side of the road, in the heavens, at an altitude of about three to five hundred feet, and between 1/4 and 1/2 mile distant.

I thought that probably, in conjunction with the night problem, this was an airborne drop or troops. First thought it might be a C-119 or a C-123. However, this object made a right hand turn above the road and then disappeared at an angle of approximately 90 degrees, straight into the sky. I can not state whether it was a plane or a type of aircraft. I can merely state that there were two rows of what appeared to be windows, brilliantly lighted, and I would estimate that they were five to six feet in height and six to eight windows in each of the two rows. After this object disappeared, I stopped my car and not out to see if I could see a plane but could see nothing. I turned off the motor on my car to see if I could hear the motors of a plane but I could hear no sound. I then proceeded to White Sands Proving Ground.

STATEMENT

The incident occurred while I was returning from an official flight from El Paso, Texas to Nellis Air Force Base, 27 November 1952, in a B-25 type aircraft at 10,000 feet altitude, visual flight miles. Exactly as I was departing the Albuquerque Adiz 16 nautical miles southeast of the Payson Homer located 65 nautical miles southeast of the Prescott Radio Range (Magnetic Heading 103 Degrees), I observed four quick bursts of black smoke, in tandem, approximately two miles directly ahead of the aircraft and at the same altitude. As I was approaching my check point, the Payson Homer, I noted the time to be 1210 PST. At the same time the crew chief, A/1C Bob J. Milton, AF 1937213, 3599th Flying Training Squadron, noted the smoke puffs. We watched for approximately two minutes when three more puffs appeared. To reassure myself I asked the crew chief if he had observed the puffs. He replied in the affirmative and asked if I thought it might be an F-86 type aircraft. About this time we observed three more puffs appear in rapid succession. The condition was not normal for Jet-type aircraft, particularly at that altitude and distance from a base. However, I immediately switched VHF channels from "A" to "B" to observe any possible emergency situation or mayday call. There was no transmission audible. At this time, exactly 1218, both the crew chief and myself observed four rapid puffs appearing, this time changing course to our left.

After approximately one minute three more puffs were observed at approximately nine o'clock to our aircraft, this time at approximately 200 yards distance. I immediately made a rapid 90 degrees turn in the direction of the puffs and observed four more to my left, which would have been behind the aircraft. I then made a rapid 180 degrees turn to observe the other side where we noticed three more puffs which would have been behind the aircraft. As I made this turn I flew in close proximity to one of the puffs of smoke for closer observation and immediately encountered rough air. I noticed the puffs to be yellowish in color and approximately 20 feet in diameter. All puffs approximately the same size and color. I flew in close proximity to another puff and again encountered rough air. At this time the puffs disappeared and no more observed.

The entire incident covered a twenty minute period. At no time did we observe any type aircraft or object. There was no mistaking the puffs for clouds as the atmospheric condition was perfectly clear, with only one small cloud hovering over a mountain some twenty miles away. The best description I can offer to identify these puffs of smoke and the succession in which they appeared would be to compare them with flak. I gathered the same impression I have had many times before, during World War II, when flying through a flak area. The incident was observed over a twenty five mile course extending from a point 16 nautical miles southeast of the Payson Homer to a point approximately nine miles northeast of the Payson Homer. The aircraft was flown directly over the Payson Homer.

STATEMENT

On 27 November 1952 in a return trip from a cross country with Lt. Colonel McGaskill, we both witnessed black puffs of smoke approximately the same altitude as we were and always the same distance in front of us. Usually two or three puffs at a time, then as we would approach the area puffs of the same black smoke would appear again a considerable distance in front of us. I told Colonel McGaskill it was weird to be alone from a B-26 but we were unable to see any type aircraft. About the time we would approach the smoke we would encounter rough air. This brought to Colonel McGaskill's attention, a similar condition when flying in a flak area in World War II. This went on for about twenty minutes and we made several 90 degree turns to find the same puffs behind us. This report is accurate to the best of my knowledge

In compliance with AF Letter 200-5, dtd 29 Apr 52, the following report is submitted. A report of an unidentified flying object was received at this office 17 November 1952.

Two non-metallic objects were seen, cloud-grey in color, globular in form, without wings, elevators or fuselage. The two objects appeared to be connected by a view. Cloud-11th bank.

This phenomenon was seen at approximately 1540, 11 Nov 52. The observer did not note the length of time objects were visible.

Visual observation was made from the home of Mr. Lott, Texas. Coordinates 97° 07' 26" 210 121'N.

Objects appeared at 75 elevation, 200° azimuth, moving in a general ESE direction to about 95° azimuth, then turned NNE.

This is the 4th report to be received from Mr. [name blacked out], Radio and Astronomy. The witness referred for interview at this time, but Mr. [name blacked out] attempted to discredit anything the witness (Mr. [name blacked out]) had to say. He expressed an enthusiasm that he may have let his imagination influence his judgment.

Weather was clear without haze with a five (5) mile wind on the ground.

As reported by Weather Section, James Connally Air Force Base, weather was clear winds WNW 15 knots at 19000 feet. Winds at 39000 feet, was NNW, 35 knots.

There were not atmospheric conditions noted which might account for the phenomena.

No physical evidence of the sightings were found.
No aircraft was seen or reported in the area.

[Letterhead]
November 15, 1952

Officer, WAFC Intelligence
James Connally Air Force Base
Waco, Texas

Dear Sir:

I wish to report a UFO sighted during the afternoon of 9 November
1952 at about 5:40 P.M.

While working on front yard preparing to mow, a 50 foot revelation occurred. I was north and looking toward the top or the east when I saw a to object at about 75 degrees elevation and 20 degrees bearing. This was a very large, bright object that bars of Venus apparently at great height and moving in a general ESE direction. Both objects were the same size, a comparison made, bright, clear, or sharply defined, but at a midway or fuzzy cloud-like appearance, cloud-ray was color roughly pinkish in tone, and was stationary, determined, but not like a cloud. It was not a cloud or wind, elevation, surface, etc.

The objects remained over each other vertically and a relatively constant area of 20 acres. They were at the same distance apart, lie together by a thin, very gray band, ragged and irregular in width, and of the same color. Clouds of about 20 miles of horizon, perhaps.

After rotating vertically for about 40 seconds, they slowly tilted to the right until they were relatively horizontal. Then after 20 degrees right rotation was resumed. The energy view connecting them was not visible.

The motion duplicated exactly a bar-bell being tilted end over end very slowly. Their relative motion was slow, then rotated horizontally, then vertically, then again horizontally, continued with the ESE to about 45 degrees elevation, and 45 degrees azimuth, then slowly moved out of sight.

Apparently, the objects did not display any relative size or visibility change, but looked exactly as they did when first seen. The ground area was relatively calm.

The witness who was standing nearby was watching the same time, and verified (but exercised over the mention of such observations) at practically the same time. I may have noticed it first.

Since the object was at a great distance, and not too near
nor distant, at this point I exclaimed, "I must get a 'scope
or THAT!" I rushed into the house to obtain a telescope,
but when I returned to the scene, the object had
vanished.

The completely finished sighting was timed and
triangulated and could give a coherent statement of
the movement or disappearance of the objects but it
short absence or an indefinite description of what
had actually occurred, though a line or two can be
hard.

During the entire part of my observation, no craft
was visible or visible and no sound. The entire
trail accompanied the passage of the objects. There
was a slight reddish tinge to the trail, and I saw
SE the whole sky was entirely cloudless, to the
haze and was a clear, deep blue.

The objects, square or our track and on a horizontal track
not cause defective vision, or glare or reflection.

As #A801, and #A1144, I have been personally visited
by USAF Intelligence. I will gladly give any other
information pertaining to this sighting or any
any detail pertaining to this sighting.

Very truly yours,

DL 100-8139

as follows:

"Dear Sir,

In the Globe news there is an interesting Flying Saucer story in which you are mentioned. I am old and retired but have studied Letters and so called Flying Saucers while at College and since college some 50 years ago. An Italian Magician who got rich with some tricks of different shaped Glasses, recently showed me his Saucer show and how he did it is old and got rich with his magic Glasses. I have since told my friends with Common Window Glasses Toy would not believe the results. But to Get Back to Flying Saucers that are Real, Recently I was Camped on a Mountain in New Mexico, and Saw a dim light at first circling around up high it circled in a Miles across Circle but kept descending. It first the light was white but on 15 feet lower it turned Green and Exploded showering lights objects in all directions. Several of these fly objects landed close to me, most of them were buried. In the Ground, but I gathered up three that were only partly buried, and brought them home with me. I notified the Pentagon in Washington what I had saw fall.

I heard nothing from them, But a Russian Scientist From the U.S.S.R. Embassy did come and buy one half of one of these objects. He was so hard we had to use a Sledge Hammer to break it in two.

In the Center was a round Hole or Vacuum, filled with fine powder this Scientist Scraped every bit of the Dust up and put it in a Box. He claims its object was Uranium and other unknown Minerals.

I am just telling you what he said because I dont Claim to know All I know is what I saw and got.

I think all this flying saucer is 99% illusion.

Respectfully Yours

AT FRIONA, TEXAS:

Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED], Friona, Texas, were interviewed and Mr. [REDACTED] advised that he was a retired farmer. He stated that he had always been interested in meteors ever since he took a correspondence course concerning meteors some 50 years ago.

[REDACTED] stated that in the spring of 1952 he was traveling in the eastern part of San Miguel County, New Mexico, with his wife when he found a large deposit of a metal unknown to him. He stated that he picked up a piece of this metal and brought it back to Friona, Texas, with him. Mrs. [REDACTED] verified this statement inasmuch as she stated that she was with him at the time he picked up the metal.

[REDACTED] was questioned concerning his statement in the above letter that he saw the material fall, but stated that he did not remember writing any such information in the letter and emphatically stated that he did not see the material fall to the earth.

[REDACTED] stated that after he found this material and returned to Friona, Texas, he wrote letters to Senator [REDACTED] D. JOHNSON of Texas and Senator [REDACTED] CLINTON ANDERSON of New Mexico concerning the material. He stated that both senators replied requesting that he ship samples of this material to a Government Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. [REDACTED] stated that he sent samples of this material to the Government Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona, and stated that the material was part of a meteor. [REDACTED] was asked if he were still in possession of all this correspondence but stated that he had destroyed it all.

[REDACTED] advised that shortly after he wrote to the two senators about this material he was visited by an unknown individual who, according to [REDACTED], displayed the credentials of the Soviet Embassy. Was asked to describe the credentials of this person and stated that they were very similar to the credentials of the writer but that the writing was in Russian, and he stated that he could read the writer's credentials, and he stated that he could not read very well but he felt sure that they were in English. This visit and could furnish no other information concerning this alleged individual with the exception of the fact that he stated that he thought this individual came from the Russian Consulate in Amarillo, Texas.

[REDACTED] stated that he was no longer in possession of any of the unknown material inasmuch as he had recently given

the remainder of the material to his wife's nephew, Mr. [REDACTED] in Lawrenceville, Illinois.

It was also pointed out that in the letter not out above [REDACTED] advised that he sold half of the material to the representatives of the Russian Embassy. At the time of the interview, he complicitly denied selling any of the material to the representatives of the Russian Embassy and stated that he could not remember having made such a statement in the letter to the individual in Amarillo, Texas.

Deputy Sheriff [REDACTED], Prions, advised that he has known the subject for many years and advised that the subject is an elderly man approximately 71 years of age. [REDACTED] advised that the subject has nothing whatsoever to do and is somewhat of a dreamer. [REDACTED] explained that in 1941 dreams of various things and then thinks about them to the extent that he actually believes what he dreams. He stated that the subject will then come to the downtown hotel or the little town of Prions, and attempt to convince the people that his dreams are actually the truth. [REDACTED] stated that the people of Prions, Texas, very seldom believe or put any faith in any matters discussed by the subject due to his mental condition.

[REDACTED] stated that the subject is entirely loyal to the United States but has merely reached that age in life where his mind has begun to deteriorate.

SUBJECT: INTERCEPT

In accordance with AEL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Form) (CIRPR), the following report of Unidentified Flying Objects is submitted:

On 8 November 1952, 1805 MST, Frederick O Sager, Police Technical Representative; S/Sgt James W Brotherton, USAF, Radar Operator; Sgt Albert Stern, Amarillo, New Mexico; while on duty in the ADES Building, Observed an unidentified aerial phenomena on the radar scope. The object was traveling at an estimated speed of 600-1,500 MPH and an estimated altitude of 40,000 ft. The object first appeared 45 miles Southwest and continued from the station, heading northwest then diverging off the scope. The object then returned on the reciprocal heading to a point 65 miles from the station. At this point contact was lost. Abnormal and extended radar scope indications were observed. The radar set was lowered 20MC, which tended to reduce the blip size to two degrees. This was still painting 20MC with 2000 change. The change of 20MC eliminates all interference. Radar scope photographs were taken with negative results. No other radar station in this area has a pick-up on this object. There is no knowledge of a visual observation of this object.

(approx 2 degrees) of the radar equipment was in the vicinity of over 40,000 ft. would be necessary for an object to be detected at 130 miles.

Summary shows mostly incorrect as to movement of object.

Upon inquiring, it was determined that an Army doctor from Walter Reed Hospital, Forest Glen Section (see circled area on Incl 3) had called the paper and stated that a USAF helicopter had delivered a patient to the hospital at the time from a southerly direction (Andrews AFB). A check was made against building locations, directions, etc., and this office decided that the helicopter location does not check out at all.
In fact, the building across the street from Bldg 7 (see Incl 3, which is Bldg 5 on Incl 4), restricts the view to a field of a few degrees from Wheaton water tower.
Additionally, at one time two objects were seen simultaneously (only one helicopter was involved).

3. A number of inquiries were made of people in the vicinity of Wheaton. Only one claimed to have seen anything which could have accounted for the sighting. He was a foreman of a road repair crew and stated that he had seen a group of about 15 brown haze or of Wheaton at about 1000 hours on 12 Nov. Nothing else of any significance was developed.

He was a foreman of a road repair crew and stated that he had seen a group of about 15 brown hawks SE of Wheaton at about 1000 hours on 12 Nov. Nothing else of any significance was developed.

DESCRIPTION

At 10:29 Mr. [REDACTED] saw two dark, almost black objects shaped like a loaf of French bread, one to the left of the tower and one to the right of the tower.

(A). The object at the left then started rising slightly to the left and stopped above the tower, about the height of the tower. The object to the right of the tower started rising to the right in a straight line.

When it reached the level of the first object, it quickly veered to the left and seemed to merge (B) with the first object, then the object moved down and to the right in a straight line, moving somewhat like it was on an escalator, down to a position (C) a little more than 1/3 of the way between (1) and (2) and slightly above the horizon. At about 10:30, sometime between position (B) and (C), Mr. [REDACTED] called the incident to the attention of Mr. [REDACTED]; then a few seconds after this, Gilmore and Mr. [REDACTED] came in.

Between (C) and (D), Mr. [REDACTED] and the others came in. This was about 10:31.

The object did not stop at C; it just slowed down. Then, from position (C), the object started very unusual gyrations, leaving smoke trails. The object at this time also changed from the "loaf of bread" to a variety of shapes. The object was changing from at all times. At one time it looked like a coin slowly revolving; at one time like a bean bag that had been activated, bulging out and contracting, sometimes getting almost oval. The one thing that all the observers agreed on was that the diameter of the object and the long side of the "loaf" never varied in measurement, but that the short side would get smaller, at times disappearing, and then it would expand until equal to the long side, becoming a circle.

As the object became more circular it appeared darker (almost black) then when it was more the shape of the loaf of bread.

One of the observers said at one time the object appeared bluish. The object was a uniform gray. (Mr. [REDACTED] and Mr. [REDACTED] said they saw dark irregular streaks running through the object, but this was not verified by the others).

The object was "sort of translucent, not transparent", no illumination. The object then careened to the ground and disappeared (D). At about the spot the object disappeared, a little closer to the tower, at a spot on the horizon more than 1/3 the distance between (1) and (2), there appeared what seemed to be smoke, billowing (similar to smoke from a large factory smoke stack). This smoke then appeared to form into an object, like

the loaf of bread. The object then moved up and to the left, disappearing from time to time and changing shape from time to time. When the object was over the tower it disappeared; then a trail of smoke appeared going up and to the right, forming the object and disappearing from time to time, and then disappeared entirely. It seemed to the observers that the distance between where the object disappeared and reappeared was covered at a remarkably fast rate. The object, the object itself moved rather slowly when it could be followed. The smoke trails were observed by all. Dr. [ILLEGIBLE] said that at (s) the object assumed a definite shape. This was substantiated (although not as positively) by Mrs.

Mr. [ILLEGIBLE] states (and it was verified by Mr. [ILLEGIBLE]) that he watched the objects from 10:30 to approximately 10:45.

    This object was definitely not a quick
    of slide or for 2 helicopters, because of its

    man-made and I also disbelieve that it
    was a craft supposedly built of "thin from
    Mats etc.

SWORN STATEMENT

10 November 1952

I, Frederick Orville Edgar observed on the PPI Scope of the AW/PPS-3 radar at about 1805 MST, 8 November 1952, an unusual presentation as follows:

A target about fifteen degrees in width appeared southeast of this station. It was moving very fast. I went from the maintenance room, where the above mentioned scope is located, into the operations room to find out if the target in question was observed by the operations personnel. After observing there for some time, I returned to the maintenance room where I determined that the lower beam was picking up the target. I then lowered the frequency of that transmitter and receiver about twenty MC. I changed frequency to determine whether or not the target was a result of interference from one of the other sites. After I changed the frequency, the target was still there. For the next few sweeps after the frequency was changed, the target stopped moving. Then started moving again. At this time I was not at first heartened as I was concentrating on determining whether what I saw was actually a target or interference. I am convinced that it was not interference from another radar.

I am a Contractor Technical Instructor at the 767th ACEW Squadron. I am employed by Philco Corporation. I have been actively engaged in electronics for the past nineteen years. I have been working with radar since 1942.

at first I thought it was
smoke but when it changed
position and shape, and direction
of movement, so distinctly I was
sure it was an object. It did not
produce any illumination, it was a
dark massive object which seemed
to change shape and position very
suddenly with only a small stream
of smoke to determine direction of
movement. It disappeared as
suddenly as it appeared.

Like sure I saw something that
I had never seen before.

PHOTO STATEMENT                                                10 November 1952

I, James H. McCutchin Jr., S/Sgt, USAF, A-14387836, do hereby make the following statement and is true to the best of my knowledge.

In the 6th of November 1952 at 1605 hrs, I was notified by the scope operator on the short range scope that he had an unusual occurrence on his scope. I then noticed what looked to me to be interference. This was on an azimuth of about 145 degrees and was moving about 5 miles per second. I noticed a maintenance personnel who was changed temporarily to 100. At the time of first appearance on scope the blip was existing approximately 10 degrees mile but after lowering the set 20 10, the blip was then only faintly about 5 degrees wide and was wilting very faintly. During the time of pickup to the time of disappearance which was approximately ten minutes, this blip had traveled from 170 miles to 45 miles from station, out to 100 miles where it disappeared, back in 55 miles from station, again and disappeared at 100 miles for good. All this occurred on the same azimuth and did not vary more than one or two degrees. This blip being on the same azimuth with azimuth and the appearance and size of blip, I do believe it was interference caused from azimuth.

The above statement is true to the best of my knowledge. I have been in radar 25 months and have been stationed here at Onarga for 71 months and am quite familiar with the appearance of interference. I am Crew Chief of Charlie Crew and am quite familiar with my work.
