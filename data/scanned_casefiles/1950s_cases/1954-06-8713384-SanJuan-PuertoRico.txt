4 June 1954
Tinglev, Denmark

1954 produced 85 photographs on 55 occasions, the largest number of different occasions that the UFOs were photographed in any one year. Among the more important 1954 produced photographs, the most foreign photographs with 20 out of the 55 photographs coming from overseas. 

The most unusual ones taken in 1954 were the following: one was a photograph of 3 white cigar-shaped objects photographed near a sun eclipse by 3 Scandinavian airline planes, which had over 50 scientists observers aboard. The photographs were taken on June 30 near Lirjehll, Denmark.

SCIENTIFIC FILM  YFBSD
About the objects shown in the scientific films received from the Air Force, I wish to report the following:

The films showed various UFOs, saucer-shaped, traveling at high speeds. The objects were clear and distinct in the films, and seemed to change directions and speeds abruptly. Several of the objects appeared to be under intelligent control.

The films showed the objects hovering, and then accelerating to tremendous speeds, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds. The objects appeared to be silvery in color, and seemed to reflect light. In several scenes, the objects were seen in formation, maneuvering in a disciplined manner.

In one sequence, the objects were traveling so fast that they seemed to become almost invisible, leaving a silvery trail. In another sequence, two objects were seen approaching each other, and then one of them suddenly veered off at a sharp angle, accelerating away at fantastic speed.

The films also showed the objects appearing to merge with one another, and then separating again. Towards the end of the films, the objects began to move erratically, making sharp turns and stops. The witnesses stated that the films were the most amazing they had ever seen, and that they had no explanation for the phenomena observed.

Col. Radford P. Schumm,
H.Q. 7221st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Ramey A.F.B., Aguadilla, P.R.

Dear Sir:
The following is my story on what I saw on June 2nd:
Originally I started on a trip with my family from San Juan to Sabana Grande via Ponce and Guayanilla. 
We were driving along the road to the town of Guayanilla when I detected something in the sky which seemed to be the moon. I glanced again for I thought the disappearance I had seen was the moon. To make sure I stopped the car I was driving and as I confirmed the "moon" was moving. Therefore I made sure I stopped the car and informed the others including my father and my sister who were riding in the back seat. They also acknowledged the phenomenon. They saw the object coming from a northeasterly direction towards a southwesterly direction. 
As we continued our course like a sailing ship from side to side and at a very slow speed. It was silvery, luminous, and we would occasionally lose sight of it, then we would see it again. As we left the mountains and arrived in the valley, the object seemingly was coming from the direction of the mountains. As soon as I realized the "moon" was moving I continued our trip but always watching the "moon" thru the trees. The "saucer" was illuminated in the dark and seemed to be dark in the center, and at the rear it was dark and so the rear of the moving object. The color of the lights was reddish or orange. Whereas I guess the height was 4 or 5,000 may be more than that in ft.
Then the "saucer" left the ground area and came into the sea area as it did a sharp turn of about 90 degrees and again came into the sky area travelling at a good speed, then it moved away with the distance. The farther it got the red blurs of the lights became noticeable and large of course and were seen in the distance. At the distance I could see it was increasing in altitude and speed.

The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a typed document, likely from Project Blue Book, describing a sighting of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over San Juan, Puerto Rico on June 8, 1954.

The text in the document is as follows:

C.I.R.P. Schuman
June 8th, 1954.

My father is a former postmaster of the town of Sabana Grande and he is now ill and unable to do much. He was mentally preaching and alert. He has a fine background and he is a highly educated individual. He has always been prominent in civic and political activities of the town.

My mother is the assistant postmaster of Sabana Grande and she is also bright and alert. She is 54. She could not be fooled very easily. Her name is Mary and she resides at Clad Heights, Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico.

As for me, I have been a customs employee and a clerk. I am now 26. I am a fun American and I am employed and she is bright and clever. As the others who have been to discriminate being: the town of Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, where I live as.

While I stopped my car to stop a car with non-resident plates to make them aware of the danger, they did not stop but I shouted "cliving a saucer" and pointed to the sky. I was signaling a saucer which seemed to be a silvery colored and it hovered for a short while some 50 feet or more above ground. This one I saw on August 25, 1954.

I projected the limes of the path of these saucers and on the point of origin we have Colombia, Venezuela, the Galapagos islands, the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean.

It is estimated that under the island in certain areas underwater, cavities exist. At night I have detected two flying saucers. That puts me in LOCO terms, that is in case none of our airplanes have been over our skies.

Respectfully yours,
San Juan, Puerto Rico
San Juan Air Terminal
