4 June 1954
Lifjell, Denmark

1954 produced 26 photographs on 26 occasions, the largest number of different occasions that the UFOs were photographed in any year to my knowledge. 1954 produced the most foreign photographs with 20 out of the 26 photographs coming from overseas.

The most unusual ones taken in 1954 were the following: one was a photograph of 3 white shiny saucer-shaped objects photographed near a sun eclipse by 3 Scandinavian Airline planes, which had over 50 scientific observers aboard. The photographer's name was [redacted] and the photo was taken on June 4 near Lifjell, Denmark.

SCIENTIFIC FILM VIEWED TODAY

In the August 8, 1954 issue of CRIFO Newsletter, we reported an expedition over Norway. We assigned Case 13 to the unknown objects in the more information. Seventeen months later, Robert Chapman, dated December 31, 1955, tells the following commentary story:

"What were the two silvery objects photographed by two Norwegian scientists high above the clouds between Oslo and Stavanger? Experts were trying to decide in London today when the film was shown to London by Mr. Ernest Graham of the Swedish Travel Agency. The objects appeared on the scroll for about 24 seconds. We have been able to obtain a few details of the film from Mr. Graham. In the course of silver spotlights, keeping at some distance, one slightly above the other. They seemed filled internally with a kind of mist and vanished into the distance. This film was taken from one of three Norwegian aircraft in the area at the time. Passengers were Gunnar Jorgensen, Commander-in-Chief, Royal Norwegian Air Force, Mack of the cipher work President of the Royal Norwegian Astronomical Society and movie cameraman. The film was taken by Mr. John Bjornal, Chief Cameraman, Ernest Graham, who was in the plane told me the objects were in view for some time."

San Juan, Puerto Rico
June 4th, 1954

Col. Radford P. Schuman,
Hq. 72nd. Strategic Reconnaissance Wing,
Ramey Air Force Base, Aguadilla, P.R.

Dear Sir:

The following is my story on what I saw on June 2nd.:

Originally I started on a trip with my family from San Juan to Sabana Grande via Ponce and Guayanilla.

We were getting close to the town of Guayanilla when I detected something in the sky which resembled the moon. I glanced again for I had the impression it was moving. To make sure I stopped the car I was driving and so I confirmed the "moon maybe". Therefore it was no and really a flying apparatus, I pointed the "thing" to my mother who was by my side and also to my father and my sister who were riding in the back seat. They also acknowledged the phenomenon. They saw as I saw the flying object coming from inland, from a northeasterly direction towards a southwesterly direction.

The "moon" was calm like a glider swinging from side to side at low speed. It was 8:12PM Wednesday June 2nd and we were close to Kilometer 14, I guess, close to the gasoline piers, the sea on the left side and the mountains at the right: the "moon" coming from the side of the mountains.

As soon as I realized the "moon" was moving I continued our trip but always watching the "moon" thru the streets of. The "saucer" was illuminated in the front and in the half-front sides of the arch. It was dark and the center part though somewhat but real slightly illuminated was rather dark and so the rear of the moving object. The color of the lights was reddish or orange firelights. Whereas no sound and I guess the height was 4 or 5,000 may be more than that in ft.

Then the saucer left the ground area and came into the sea area it did a sharp turn of about 90 degrees and instead of flying sidewise it took a direct course towards the horizon. The lights increased in size with the distance. The rather it got the more of the lights became more noticeable and large stains of orange and red were seen in the distance. In the distance I could see it was increasing in altitude and speed.

I did not call the military authorities at that time because I thought they had surely spotted this "visitor" in their radar screen for this location. I am sure this is within range of Ramey Air Force Base anyway.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Col R.P. Schuman                -2-                        June 4th,1954.

I saw the "saucer" for at least 2 or three minutes before it got to the beach then it took around one turn to disappear in the long horizon. I calculate the thing is around 100 feet in diameter or less or more.

My father is a former Postmaster of the town of Sabana Grande and he is now 74, a healthy and strong man mentally speaking and alert. He has a fine background and he knows how to differentiate and appreciate things very well.

His name is [illegible], Address: c/o [illegible], Sabana Grande, P.R.

My mother is the Assistant of the Postmaster of Sabana Grande who is my brother. She is 61 and as bright and alert as my dad. She can not be [illegible] either. Her name is [illegible] same address.

My sister is a graduate of Siena Heights College of Adrian, Michigan. She is now a Pan American Airways employee and she is bright and clever. As the others she knows to differentiate things. Her name is [illegible] Puerto Rico. She is 26.

As for me I have two years college in-level course and I work as a Customs Inspector for Uncle Sam. That [illegible] was sick having stomach trouble but this did not interfere with my sense of will, I knew pretty well what was going on.

While I stopped my car I tried to stop a car with non-resident plates to make them aware of the saucer, They did not stop but I should "mighty saucer!" and pointed to the sky. The car continued its march.

I am enclosing a sketch comparing it with the other saucer I saw on August 26, 1953 at which time I reported it next day to Col. Sanders of CIC in San Juan by telephone. On that occasion the saucer was silvery colored and it shined all over. Had the same direction from northeast to southwest. This one I saw at 2AM over the town of Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico in the southwest tip of the island of Puerto Rico. I was with my family. The distance from earth was great. I might say 1000 ft away and it still looked like a nickel. This one must have been at least 200 ft or more in diameter. The edges were brighter than the belly or the upper part. The movement was always the same sideways but at great speed. It was on and turned off the lights. There was no reflection from the moonlight when it turned off its lights.

I projected the lines of the path of these saucers and took the point of origin it starts from Moscow in Russia and on the point of Destination we have Colombia, Venezuela, the Galapagos Island, the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean.

I recommend a 24 hour watch over the island of Puerto Rico for out of two trips at night I have detected two flying saucers. That puts me in 1000 points. That is in case none of our aircraft have been over our area in these positions and time.

Respectfully yours,

[Signature location]
San Juan, Puerto Rico
