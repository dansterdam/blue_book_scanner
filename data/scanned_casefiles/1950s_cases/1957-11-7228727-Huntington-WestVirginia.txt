Hq, DO3, File 3DO 24-198, SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT, Subj: Unidentified Flying Object sighted at 1677 14th Avenue, Huntington, West Virginia, at approximately 22302, 1 November 1957.

[Redacted] related that on 1 November 1957, she had first heard a crash, then a sound like a jet engine and then a "beeping" noise. She went outside her home and upon looking up towards her roof, she saw an object that appeared like two (2) hemisphere head off her object. She described the object as metallic in appearance and about the size of an automobile. She advised that the bottom half of the object appeared to be swirling the power and added that it appeared to revolve or vibrate. She added that there appeared to be a small red light (about the size of a parking light) at the axis of the lower hemisphere which was a steady light. She stated that about two (2) seconds after she had entered her rear yard and saw the object "on top of her house", the object started to ascend straight up and was out of sight in about one (1) minute. She described the object as a circular form the bottom as it went upward and added that she could not see the upper hemisphere since there was no light on this part. She stated that as the object started to move upward there was a downdraft of air which caused her housecats to blow out and leave and twigs around the yard.

[Redacted] advised that she was getting ready for bed when she first heard the crashing sound which also awakened her daughter. She stated that a venetian blind in her attic had been discovered to have fallen and she believed this may have occurred for the crashing sound. She stated they have been blown down by the wind previously. However, she stated there was a lot of wind connected with the object. She estimated that her first sighting of the object was about 15 degrees above the horizon line (her home is a story and a half bungalow, approximately 20 feet high at the peak). She stated she asked her neighbors if they had heard any unusual sounds and they related to her that they heard a commotion outside but did not investigate. She knew of no other witnesses to this occurrence.

[Redacted] advised she had only witnessed this object with unaided eyes. No examination was made of the roof nor was any other physical evidence available. She drew a rough diagram of the object which was refined and further detailed in her presence by S/A RICHARDSON. A detailed drawing is attached as an inclosure to this report.

Time of sighting was estimated as approximately 1730-1735. Light conditions were described as night.

Location of Observer was determined as approximately 38° 25' - North, and 82° 45' - West.

Identified herself as stated above and claimed no military or other observer experience. She advised that the reason she had not previously reported this incident was for fear of ridicule. She requested that she be protected from all forms of notoriety as a result of reporting this incident.

WEATHER:
c. Source described the weather as Clear and Calm, and she advised visibility was good.
