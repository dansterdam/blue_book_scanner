REPORT NO.    TR-1334-57        PAGE    1    OF    1    PAGES

1. Description of Object:
   a. Shape was that of a normal aircraft bar as seen on a PPI scope.
   b. Size was 2 to 5 times larger than that of any target "Bill" scope.
   c. N/A
   d. Only one "Bill" was observed
   e. N/A
   f. "
   g. "

2. Tracking Data:
   a. The "target" coverage was very good. The radar beam. The beam 
   was 5°. Then, the "target" speed was well to 620Gm/hour. The two ob-
   servations were: First, "Bill" was first seen at about 5 min. back in 
   the PPI at about 5 min. for approx. 3 min. W of the base. The JUGS "Bill" 
   1st PART was on the PPI.

3. Description of Course of Object:
   a. "Bill" was first noted in the PPI scope because of its relative 
   position.

   b. "Bill" first came at azimuth of 510 mils (51.0°) at a range of 
   approx. 160 nautical miles. Radar did not have elevation marking. Posi-
   tion.

   c. "Bill" disappeared at same azimuth and range as when first detected.

   d. "Bill" remained on a constant azimuth. After appearing at about 
   150m it closed to a range of about 40-50m. It appeared stationary with 
   position at range of 150m (at the rim of the PPI scope). After a few seconds 
   at this range, again for a short time, again for a few seconds, again a 
   short time, again for a short time, reappeared a third time, repeated 
   again.

   e. So, 10 above.

   f. Observed for 5-6 minutes.

4. Manner of Observation:
   a. Ground Electronic, AN/TPS-1D radar, blue on L 
   band, 1.5 to 1.5 cm. Sweeps of radar, i.e., altitude 
   "Bill" was seen on L band.

   b. 1/4

   c.

4. Time and Date of Sighting:
    a. First seen at about 1930Z, 20 October 1957.
    b. Daylight conditions.

5. Location of Observer was at Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany.

6. Individuals:
    a. Richard L. GUTSHALL, SP4, 9th AAA Bn.
    b. Wayne L. COATES, SP5, 9th AAA Bn.
    c. Both observers are considered competent and reliable men.

7. Weather Conditions:
    a. N/A

    b. "Weather conditions at time of 'watch'" were checked with Major 
    C. O. GRAHAM, Weather Officer 58th ABW, who stated that (ATO), Kiesler Air 
    Base, Wiesbaden. He gave the following information: From 8 October at 
    1930Z on 20 October 1957:

    (1) There was a complete overcast to low altitude. An extensive 
    wet cloud area at Wiesbaden.

    (.) ELEVATION        TEMPERATURE           DEW POINT
         Surface         + 7°C                 + 6°C
         850 mb          + 1°C                 0°C
         800 mb          - 3°C                 -7°C
         700 mb          - 9°C                -12°C
         760 mb          - 9°C                -12°C

8. Major Significance: This was or conditions suggest that numerous 
factors can be ruled out. However, it is not stating, however, that this 
was an actual sighting confirming the reliable.

9. Negative

10. Several aircraft were circling in the vicinity of the radar range including several air traffic at Wiesbaden Air Base and Mainz, Main Airfield.

11. Comments of the Reporting Officer:
    a. The two officers stated that a satisfactory near inter-terrain 
    visibility was not possible. (Continued in "Remarks" section at it)

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

b. The Electronics Branch, DCS Comp, 14th Air Force, was also contacted in conjunction with this investigation. Capt. Hoover, through Capt. Ginsburgh, called all personnel that were in the area of "sighting" through the Air Control Center, Tactical Communications Center, 14th Air Force. All AF personnel contacted, including Capt. Hoover, Capt. Ginsburgh, Capt. Hale, Capt. Roth, and others, knew nothing of the occurrence generally in low weather stations located in this area in the arm of this "sighting".

c. The weather conditions (see Par 79) were such that a layer of dry air will exist. The average wind at 760 mb. altitude was from the northeast, noted that 760 mb. would be at an altitude in the vicinity of 7,700 ft.

1. It is estimated that the UFOB was electronic phenomena caused by anomalous propagation.
