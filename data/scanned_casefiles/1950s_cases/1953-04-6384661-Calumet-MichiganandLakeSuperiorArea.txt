CONCLUSION
PLOTTING RADAR INTERFERENCE
Targets were believed to be interference from airciraft electronic equipment or cosmic noise. The targets from the radar at Calumet, Michigan appeared to be from a series of targets which were assessed to be aircraft interference or cosmic noise.

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Reflection 0132Z and 0152Z a series of targets were picked up on radar at Calumet, Michigan. Speed was from 100 mph to 600 mph. Targets shifted altitude from 6,000 ft. to 21,000 ft. in seconds. Appeared to be from aircraft electronics or cosmic noise. Speed was from 100 mph to 600 mph.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Calumet, Michigan                                 19 April 1953

I. DESCRIPTION
On 10 April 1953 between 0112 and 0215Z a series of targets were sighted by the 66395th Air Reserve Squadron, Calumet, Michigan. The plots originated approximately 50 miles from their station, from 020 clockwise to 251 degrees. Speed was estimated from 1600 mph to 5000 mph. This situation was radar sighting only and appeared intermittent. No visual targets were noted. Several individual target tracings were noted varying in apparent size and speed. The general weather conditions at the time of sighting were three miles visibility, snow and overcast. Northern lights were clearly visible during this period.

II. DISCUSSION
This is another of the better type of FLYOBFT. The intelligence officer is to be commended for the initiative shown in making as complete a report as possible under the conditions. The model the preliminary evaluation as to the time he prepares the report, saving Project Blue Book the problem of later correction of faulty observation.

III. CONCLUSION
Other (radar interference).

DATE OF OBSERVATION: 20 APRIL 1953
TIME OF OBSERVATION: 1250 CST
SUMMARY: A luminous circular object, estimated at 30-40 feet in diameter, was observed maneuvering at high speed over Calumet, Michigan. The object was tracked by radar and appeared to originate from the direction of Lake Superior. It was believed to be an interference from airborne radar, originating on Lake Superior.
