Calumet, Michigan                                                                   19 April 1953

I.    DESCRIPTION

On 20 April 1953 between 0118z and 0215z a series of targets were sighted by the 669th AC&W Squadron, Calumet, Michigan. The plots originated approximately 50 miles from their station, from 050° clockwise to 251°. Speed was from 1800 mph to 9400 mph. This sighting was a radar sighting only and appeared as a normal target except for speed. No abrupt maneuvers were noted. Several individual targets were noted. This squadron was using an AN/FPS-3 type search radar unit, with a Myerscough modification. There had been no maintenance difficulties. The general weather conditions at the time of sighting were three mile visibility, snow and overcast. Northern Lights were clearly visible during this period.

II.   DISCUSSION

This is another of the better type FLYOBJET. The Intelligence officer is to be commended for the initiative shown in making an complete report as was possible under the circumstances. He made the preliminary evaluation at the time to prepare the report, saving Project Blue Book the time and effort to investigate a sighting of this type. His evaluation was a "Targets are believed to be interference from shipborne radar, originating on Lake Superior".

III.  CONCLUSION

Other (radar interference).
