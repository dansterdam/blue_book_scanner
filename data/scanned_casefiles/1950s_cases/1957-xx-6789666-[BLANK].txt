The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line extending from the horizon, illustrating how high an object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch depicts two separate views - one showing a person on a road with buildings and trees in the background, and the other showing a smaller curved landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
