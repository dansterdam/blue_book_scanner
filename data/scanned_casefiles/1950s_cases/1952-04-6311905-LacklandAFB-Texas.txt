LOCATION OF OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS:
SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS

U. S. April 1952                                                 INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
                                                                  LACKLAND AIR FORCE BASE, TEXAS

1st Lt. EDWARD J. JACKLIN, Chief, Intel. Div.

Hq 3d Rec, 3700.48 bp, Lackland AFB

Subj: UFO UFOB-AC/962-12 Dec 1951, Subject: Sighting

The following report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the San Antonio area is the first such report to be received by Intelligence Division, Lackland Air Force Base.

The observer could not give much detailed information on the sighting. The object was accidentally and was observed through a closed window. No corroborative to the object was audible to the observer.

The observer heard that he thought was a C-97 take off from Kelly AF Base and went to his window to watch for the plane. This light of a plane was on Kelly AF Base and lower right half of the window, making its first right turn in the traffic pattern. The observer remained at his window and scanned the sky. Through the upper left half of the window he sighted an object which he could not identify. This object was described as being white, sharp shaped, with a white trail or pull in length to the direction of the object. The object was traveling at a presumably high rate of speed in a straight line from SE to NW. The altitude and actual size of the object could not be determined but the observer estimated to the observer as approximately 1/2 second, disappeared behind a cloud movement. The object was observed for approximately 1/2 second and the disappearance of the object occurred through an estimated 10 degrees arc, passing through the arc in slightly over 1 second. The observer estimated the time as 225 hours, 9 April 1952.

The Kelly AF Base Flight Log records the take off of a C-97 at 2229 hours, 9 April 1952, take off of 2230 hours, and data, including location, wind velocity, 17 knots; cloud condition, overcast (broken); cloud base, 6,500 feet estimated.

The observer was alone in his room in barracks building 2102, Lackland AF Base, at the time of the sighting. This barracks building is located approximately 1/2 mile NW of Kelly AF Base flight line.

No additional reports of this sighting have been received.

The observer has worked as a Cryptographic Technician with an AG & T Unit and is presently working with Radio Voice of Lackland.
