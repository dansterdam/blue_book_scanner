ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR RER 19 Dec 1951, Subject: RIDGEO. 1st Hq, MSAF, ATICONC/Cg, Jul 1951, Subjscts: RIDGEO

The following report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the San Antonio area is the first such report to be received by Intelligence Division, Lackland Air Force Base.

The observer could not give much detailed Information on the sighting. The object was sighted accidentally and was observed through a closed glass window. No sound attributable to the object was audible to the observer.

The observer heard what he thought was a C-97 take off from Kelly AF Base and went to his window to watch for the plane. The lights of a plane were observed through the lover right half of the window, making its first right turn in the traffic pattern. The observer remained at his window and scanned the sky. Through the upper left half of the window he sighted an object which he could not identify. This object was de- scribed as being white, sphere shaped, with a white trail equal in length to the dia- meter of the sphere. The object was traveling at en apparently high rate of speed in a straight line from SE to NW. The altitude and actual size of the object could not be determined but the object appeared to the observer as an ordinary marble in size. The object was observed for approximately 7 second, disappeared behind a cloud momen- tarily and reappeared for another second. The initial sighting to final disappearance of the object occurred through an estimated 10 degree arc, passing through the arc in slightly over a second. The observer estiwated the time of sighting to be 2245 hours, 9 April 1952.

The Kelly AF Base Flight log records the take off of a C-97 at 2239 hours, 9 April 1952. The weather report of 2230 hours, same date, indicates the wind direction as 140, velocity, 17 knots; cloud condition, overcast (broken); cloud base, 6500 feet estimated.

The observer was alone in his room in barracks building 2162, Lackland AF Base, at the time of the sighting. This barrack building is located approximately 2 air miles E of Kelly AP Base flight line.

No additional reports of this sighting have been received.

The observer has worked as a Cryptographic Technician with an AG 4 unit and is presently working with Radio Voice of Lackland.
