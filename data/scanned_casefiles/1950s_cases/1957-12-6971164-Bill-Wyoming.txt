24 February 1958

Dear Mr.

Your letter of 2 January 1958 addressed to the Weather Records Processing Center in San Francisco has been referred to this office for reply.

From you description the sighting you observed on 22 December 1957 was a fireball or bolide. The coloring (greenish white) and other characteristics attest to this conclusion, and there were similar sightings of bolides in that area last year.

Thank you for your detailed report. Your interest in this subject is appreciated.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

SUBJECT: Reporting of Sighting of "UFO"

[The rest of the text is partially illegible or cut off, but appears to be describing a UFO sighting located in a specific section with coordinates, possibly in Wyoming.]

Antelope Creek Ranch
Bill, Wyoming
January second 1958

Missile Center
Department, Room 117
California

Since 1:50 we had one inch of snow. Sometime last night it fell. Since the last snow we have been feeding the bulls, we saw a bob cat, and as we were going to the ranch we saw a little cat. We got home, but the kids went back to the ranch. We stayed that they were gone an unusual time and watched for them.

Looking west, by a trifle north, when I saw the light I was about 1/2 miles west, until I saw the gate--the time--the gate--the time. I was a mile. I was quite.

The bottom of the page has two black redacted sections.

The image appears to be a map of Wyoming with various regions labeled. The text I can see includes:

WYOMING (at the bottom of the map)

The map is divided into sections labeled with words like "DRAINAGE" in multiple areas. There are numerous small towns and geographic features marked, but most are too small to clearly read in this image. There is a legend at the bottom right of the map, but the text is too small to make out clearly.

The map appears to be a topographical or administrative map showing drainage regions, county boundaries, and other geographic features of Wyoming.
