Bureau of Unidentified Objects
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:

We would like to report a strange flying object in this area which took place on March 16, 1959 at 8.P.M. We witnessed this as we backed out of my driveway which is in the vicinity of the Little Creek Amphibious Base, Norfolk, Va.

I was accompanied by Mrs. [redacted] and her 12 year old son. It was the son who first brought it to our attention by remarking, "Mother, it's lightening!"

With that, we all looked up and saw a large ball-like, yellowish orange object hovering in the sky to the North East. It was tremendous in proportion to any object we had over seen in the sky before. It gave forth an explosive glare of light which illuminated the entire surrounding area of the housing project in which I live.

Each flash lasted to the count of 5, with short intervals in between. Then the object was obliterated in complete darkness.

We then pulled out of the driveway and drove up two blocks to Little Creek Rd. when all three of us saw it again. This time it was very close to the ground, in fact we thought it was going to land. In this stage it was no longer flashing, but holding a steady, brilliant glow of light. It was then lost from sight as though it landed.

By this time we were all highly excited and instead of going to our appointed destination, we drove towards the Amphibious Base and decided to follow it.

We drove a mile and a half in an easterly direction and it appeared again in the same N.E. direction, only this time it was farther away, higher in the sky and flashing again.

In this position it flashed twice. The last flash remained longer than any of the preceding flashes. During the last flash we were able to discern a dim but definite outline of a strange craft which none of us had ever seen before.

For this report we would like to add that this statement is completely true and this is an accurate description of what we saw in the sky.

To whom this may concern:

I am enclosing a letter from my friend Mrs. [redacted] and one from her son who were with me when the object in mention was sighted in our locality.

In this letter I would like to establish a few pertinent facts about myself because I realize such a report could be taken lightly. It is my sincere wish that our observations of this object will be believed to be a true one.

I am 40 years old and have lived in Norfolk for over 20 years and for many years near the vicinity of the Naval Air Base. I am familiar with the planes and jets that fly overhead. For nearly four years I have lived at my present address which is near the Little Creek Amphibious Base and the Norfolk Municipal Airport.

I am familiar with all the searchlights and aircraft landing lights in this area. I have never seen any such object or light in my entire life, before this.

Also, I would like to make it quite clear that my eyes are trained for color, lines and proportions as well as perspective as these are subjects I teach daily in my own Art Studio in Norfolk. I have also taught Art in the Public School system and the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences.

After seeing this phenomenon it was so impressed on my mind as to its relative proportions, color and distance that I went to my studio the following morning and made a large pastel picture of it in full color. Those who saw it said it was frightening.

I have been very active in the Art circles in this city for 10 years and feel that my knowledge of Art has been invaluable to me during this experience.

Sincerely hoping that you will give our report and letters your immediate attention and cooperation, I remain

It is undoubtedly true that many reports of this nature have gone false. On the other hand, many honest and intelligent people have continued to make sightings in the sky. Proof of these reports have shown some basis and by rough reading, sufficient in this domain.

However, scientists and researchers while we are doing research on these objects in a free time, capacity, and neutrality.

But rather a desire to solve with other scientific thinking, this act accompanying aspect.

More than this, I feel, that such experience should not be dampened by degree this American people again and again, while it is a

Here is the OCR text from the document:

1st half of 845 Bomb Wing, Langley AFB
Called at 1320 March 30, 54. They checked
into the sighting and determined B-66's were
dropping flares at the time of sighting.
The a/c were from the 363 TAC RECON WG at
Shaw AFB, N.C. who were Langley based.
The drawing showed nothing but a black of
light. The lady wanted a confirmation to the
effect that if the picture was published she
would get credit for it. It helps pull the
commercial aspect.

1st Sgt. will send all info in a TWX
and will not send the picture unless we still
find a well for it.
