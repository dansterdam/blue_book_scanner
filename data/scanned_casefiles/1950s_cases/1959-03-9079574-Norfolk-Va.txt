March 18, 1959
Bureau of Unidentified Objects
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:
We would like to report a strange flying object in this area which took place on March 16, 1959 at 8:30 p.m. We witnessed this and we looked out of our delivery van which is in the vicinity of the Little Creek Amphibious Base, Norfolk, Va.
I was accompanied by Mrs. I am an employee and has 12 year old son. It was the son who first brought it to attention by yelling: "Look, look, there, what is that?" We all looked up and saw a large ball-like yellowish orange object hovering in the sky to the north. East. It appeared to be quite larger in proportion to any object we had ever seen in the sky before. It gave forth an explosive glare or light which illuminated the entire surrounding area of the housing project in which I live.
When this light flashed, it was in between the interval of 5, with shorter intervals in between. When the object was obliterated in complete darkness.
We then pulled out of the driveway and drove up two blocks to Little Creek Rd. When all of the drawn of us saw it again. This time it was giving a steady, brilliant glow of light. It was then lost from sight as though it had landed.
By this time we were all highly excited and instead of going to our appointed destination, we drove towards the Amphibious Base and decided to follow it. We drove a mile and a half in an easterly direction and it appeared again in the same N.E. direction, only this time it was farther away, higher in the sky and flashing again.
In this position it flashed twice. The last flash remained longer than any of the preceding flashes. During the last flash we were able to discern a disc but definite outline of the object could not be seen before.
For this report we would like to add that this statement is completely true and this is an accurate description of what we saw in the sky.

To whom this may concern:
I am enclosing a letter from my friend Mrs. ****** and one from her son who were with me when the object in question was sighted in our locality. It is this letter I would like to establish a few pertinent facts about myself because I realize such a report could be taken lightly. It is my sincere wish that our observations of this object will be believed to be a true one. I am old enough to have lived in Norfolk for over 30 years and for many years near the vicinity of the Naval Air Base. I am familiar with the planes and jets that are stationed there. For nearly four years I have lived at my present address which is near the Little Creek Amphibious Base and the Norfolk municipal Airport. I am familiar with all the searchlights and aircraft landing lights in this area. I have never seen any such object or light in our locality before this.
Also, I would like to make it quite clear that my eyes are trained for color, lines and proportions as well as perspective as these are subjects I teach daily under the Art Institute in Norfolk. I have also taught in the public school system and the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences.
After seeing this phenomenon it was so impressed on my mind as to its proportions, color and distance that I went to my studio the following morning and made a large pastel picture of it in full color. Those who saw it said it was frightening. 
I have been very active in the Art circles in this city for 10 years and feel that my knowledge of Art has been invaluable to me during this experience.
Sincerely hoping that you will give our report and letters your immediate attention and cooperation, I remain.

Norfolk, Va.

March 14, 1959

At 8:15 p.m. patrol officer Edward Mathias, driving a patrol car, observed moving lights in the sky. They appeared to be at a considerable distance, and moved in a northerly direction at a rapid rate of speed. Mathias observed the lights for approximately 10 minutes before they disappeared from sight.

Mathias reported the incident to the desk sergeant, who in turn notified the Civil Defense Director, C.V. Hudgins. Hudgins obtained a report from Mathias and forwarded it to the Air Force. This report constitutes the initial report on this incident.

Transcription of the text in the document:

March 9, 1959
Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
Sighted at 9:20 p.m., March 5, 1959. Object observed was round, brilliant, gold in color, and about the size of the full moon. It moved slowly from east to west, and disappeared behind trees and buildings at the end of sighting. The object was silhouetted against the night sky and was observed for about one minute. It made no sound and left no trail.

The witness is reliable and all right. He will not stand the publicity so his name should not be published for it.
