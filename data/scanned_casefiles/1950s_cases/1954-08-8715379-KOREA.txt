AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

1. Description of object:
   a. When first sighted, the object was seen at an altitude of approximately 73,000 feet.
   b. Height was about thirty (30) feet in diameter. Relative size was estimated at 2 degrees of arc.
   c. The object is reported as six or eight objects near the altitude of their estimation. 6-10,000 feet above their estimation.
      However, a mathematical computation taking into consideration the angle of elevation and the horizontal distance, at 31,000 feet above the ground, would place the object approximately 73,000 feet above the earth. If this altitude is correct, an object which appears to be 30 feet in diameter is a rather large object.

   d. The object was predominantly white in color, but at times it appeared

2. Description of course of object:
   a. The flight commander was looking for aircraft of another flight when he first sighted the object.
   b. The object at the time of sighting was at an angle of elevation of approximately 70 degrees (a true angle of 45 degrees taken into consideration) to the observer and on a 320 degree heading with a sun azimuth of approximately 300 degrees.
   c. The object at the time of its disappearance was at an angle of elevation of approximately 20 degrees heading and a sun azimuth of 300 degrees.
   d. The object remained stationary for about twenty (20) minutes. One observer then saw it split into three (3) elements: element (1) and two (2) disappeared and one remained. The remaining element appeared to be 15 degrees vertical roll.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: 6oth Fighter Interceptor Wing, ADC 76       REPORT NO: IR-2-54
Group Intelligence                                 DATE: 2     PAGE: 2

I was member three of a flight of three F-86's on routine training mission in 51 August 1954. Our cell high was about 20,000 feet and we were flying in a loose tactical formation southeast of line for and make several "bounce" on each other. We were approximately 15 miles southwest of K-8 at 1500 hrs when at 270 degrees and 42,000 feet when Shark 1 (Lt Tabor) called and said he had an object at sight at about 1 o'clock and very high by position.

In Tabor then set up an orbit to the left around the object at the same time. We were in the clear with Badger. Lt. Tabor asked then to make positive radar contact with him and he find if they had any unidentified objects in our area. Tabor advised July, we did not see any extreme amount of radio chatter at this time which made good radio contact difficult. Badger could not verify this but they had no unidentified objects on their radar scope.

It was during this time that I sighted the object and the action to pick up the object and the action to pick up the object slightly before my element leader. I sighted it at approximately 70 degrees high and at 1:00 o'clock position. It was a bright metallic object.

[Top header details are partially illegible]

On 31 August 1954 at 1825, while flying number 769 at 36,000 feet, position 06 103°, on compass heading 110 degrees, it appeared an object in the 9 o'clock position at 45 degrees azimuth. It appeared like the shiny top of a common pin. Disregarding the size of the object, the color was bad to none. We continued on same course and the object moved to eight o'clock and then almost to seven. The object was observed for about 10 minutes. We were unable to keep the object in view.

Since the sun was behind the object at eight o'clock to our position, the object was difficult to see.

                AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. The following crew interrogation was made by Captains Davis and Konal, USAF, at K-14, on 3 August 54. The interrogation covers two separate reconnaissance missions made by the 15th Tac Recon Sq (RF-80) on 28 July and 1 Aug 54.

2. On crew, flying in F-80 aircraft, is assigned to the 31st Strategic Recon Squadron, 15th Tac Recon Sq (RF-80), Far East Air Forces. The crew is well qualified, experienced in photo reconnaissance missions, and has flown daylight missions in this area, and are well considered reliable observers.

3. Both missions reported herein were briefed and flown over established reconnaissance routes in the Far East during the hours of darkness. Attached is the number of significant visual observations made by the crew.

4. Specific observations of the individual crew members concerning the mission are as follows:

a. Aircraft Commander:
Witnessed "blue haze" approximately 1 foot in diameter and 20 feet long rising above the aircraft for a period of 2 to 3 seconds. The "haze" appeared to twinkle and was noticed to rise vertically. A lot of water was condensed on his canopy. This was called to his attention by the Squadron Commander who was flying in the pilot's position.

b. Radar Observer:
(1) Had two objects on his scope at 40 miles range and 2 to 3 miles between objects. Generally within 0°C and 0°C. Two objects came to his scope at a relative bearing of 345°, departing at 290°. The speed of the objects was very high, and the aircraft's speed on the scope was virtually constant. The central Fire Control Gunner who saw a bluish white streak in approximately the same position as the scope objects.

(2) The radar set being used was the F-13 with the antenna tilt up to maintain surveillance up to 5 above flight level. The equipment was set at 50 miles range with 1/2 mile delay. The 1/2 mile delay had no scope changes by earlier drivers. Fighters during practice intercepts in the area had no scope returns, but of same general appearance.

c. Photographic Observer:
Saw a reddish-orange streak pass over the aircraft from 12 to 1 o'clock. Approximately 1/2 ring of 1/2 mile size. Saw 3 or 4 similar sightings over the three previous flights. Appeared to be a streak of light, and felt that each was considerably higher than jet speed.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

d. Night Visibility:
Although this flight engineer made many undesirable sightings, listing interrogation with this, he reported only one such incident. He saw an orange or reddish-orange streak or light, lasting 2 to 3 seconds. Seemed to rise suddenly, turn on and then off, and lasted from 2 to 3 seconds.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM    Korea, ATLO        | REPORT NO.    14-52-51        | PAGE    3    OF    6    PAGES

a described the light as much longer and a different color from the flare in use
observed from AF-52, 20th group.

NARRATIVE

a. Will Turner saw the same 11 o'clock sighting. It was described by 6 light aircraft pilot
who also saw this not at first, but later. The pilot was flying a T-6 aircraft and
to the doc sighting, he reports a similar light about 11 o'clock, 20 miles of 10 o'clock,
to 7 o'clock high at 2 o'clock altitude. He was flying at 11,000 feet. The light was
exhausted by rolling from 11 o'clock high to 4 o'clock high. The flare was acting as
extended to a southward arc.

Central Fire Control Gunner

"Observed many sightings from all o'clock positions. Observed
embarrassed to report more. * * * few thinking, that we hardly could be confused.
reported that during the early morning hours of 5 July 1954, while flying a B-26, long
long at 10's length. All were above to aircraft and at 3 to 5 o'clock position. The
sun height was 3°. Altitude and then turned off with no flare. * * *"

Terrain below was 7/10 turned off before describing flare. In altitude, he was above
and did not distinguish into the underseas. He also reported a bright light to walking
a dim speed from 3 to 3 o'clock: were in reverse."

g. During the flight, the aircraft was in the clear at an altitude of 16,500
feet, over an overcast with tops estimated at 8,500 feet. There was no moon, excellent visibility and numerous other visual sightings in the clear. These were discussed, and were
finally ruled out as being any radiation, light, or other unexplained phenomena.

h. The aircraft was flying "blackout-with" dark X transverse in normal
position, and the navigational radar AN-APS-15 turned on throughout the flight.

i. Two JDL stations, located on and adjacent to the LST of Tokchok and
contacted over VHF during the series of the sightings, and verified during the period. One at 5th and 6th, other at 7th and 8th. Both were friendly. During
the time during the reported incident, the aircraft was flying within 20 miles of a
friendly LST area.

j. The next mission which is not well cover we alone on 3 August 1954.
This mission was flown in weather until strong icing necessitated climbing above
altitude. This was about 12,000 feet. At top of clouds, about 10/10 overcast, breaking
occasionally to 8/10. Visibility was excellent above 8/10 clouds with many stars visible but
not clear. No visual sightings were noted. At 12,000 feet, the aircraft was on a 310 degree
patrol loops. The aircraft was close out near not over friendly territory and
was in the clear.

k. As the flight proceeded northwestward from the east-west coast, several
messages were received from "Larew" GCI site located at Chunchong-in informing the
aircraft what other aircraft were orbiting. 100 miles or relatively still or for
identification. Through this method, the aircraft was able to keep track of its position
in the area. The aircraft that orbiting the aircraft was able to clear up some
misunderstandings and was informed of the aircraft's position. The aircraft was

1. After the aircraft was ordered to a combat support mission, thirty miles from Suwon, Korea, in the vicinity of 110° 38' west longitude and 38° 08' north latitude, at approximately 1100 b. window from 5th area. After charging course to 110° the ball gunner observed a ball shaped object approximately 2 miles away at 11 o'clock high. The object appeared to travel from 5 o'clock high to 6 o'clock level. The Aircraft Commander and pilot visually sighted the object which was white in color and appeared to be 20 to 25 feet in diameter. Clouds from 2 to 3 seconds. Upon leaving the clouds, to ball gunner saw the object again at 1 o'clock low.

2. A few minutes later the same navigator and pilot survey the rag or object again. A strange gray haze or cloud, which in the case of the aircraft rose at about twenty second intervals. Both crew members were of the impression that these were some kind of tracers, possibly cannon. First a them.

3. Later, while passing through the base of clouds, the central gunner saw a round object approximately 12 o'clock. The aircraft was headed to same alt of on 24-1, alt unknown.

4. On the return flight across South Korea the Aircraft Commander asked an interrogating officer, two were passing a friendly or unfriendly to the "wall" in the area.

5. On 12 August 1951, the F-84, crew, which was to escort or the F-82, was interrogated as to whether they saw anything unusual. They were made under usual, theoretical circumstances in the 5th Air Force mission. The crew had no unusual observations to report, other than normal flight conditions, "difficulty in over-water close air support mission" was noted. The crew flew at 16,500 ft. and there was practically no light.

6. It was on "normal" until 5th miles out over the International waters that something to "bandit". It was on standby position during the incidents mentioned.

COMMENTS of the Preparing Officer:

6. The crew flying out of these missions appears reliable and sincere in their reporting. There was no evidence to cast doubt on their ability to observe, identify, and report. All crew members were friendly and with observation under similar weather conditions as existed.

7. In both instances, the friendly aircraft was visible on SSE scans, yet no visual contact was made. Tracks or scans were in close proximity. Friendly, although at one time two miles apart.

8. The unusual nature and adverse conditions under which most of these activities were made, plus the fact that it is desirable to preserve these actual situations, preclude a detailed, comprehensive, final, conclusive report.
