Air Force Letter No. 200-5, dated 29 April 1952

I, Capt. Jack Buchanan, 15004A, while on a VF flight direct from
Huntsville Airport on a heading of 255 degrees, at an altitude of 6,000 feet, did observe an intensely bright, white object. At the time of this sighting I was flying at an altitude of 6,000 feet, at an indicated airspeed of 240 miles per hour on a heading of 55 degrees. A 360 degree turn was made at 87 degrees, 11 minutes 30 seconds west, 34 degrees 45 minutes 30 seconds north, I looked off to my right and observed an intensely white, apparently motionless object. At the time of the observation the aircraft was flying at approximately 10,000 feet. I could estimate the object for a period of about 30 seconds while looking up again the object had apparently disappeared. I immediately began looking in the direction where the object was observed in an attempt to identify it.

Upon initially observing the object, the first impression was that it was approximately 8 miles away, an altitude of approximately 10,000, 30 miles. Its size could not be determined but looked much like a white flare (generally bright) except that no "shimmering" was evident and that it appeared solid.

The weather was excellent with only a few, if any, scattered clouds in the vicinity of Nicholas Reservoir Lake approximately 30 miles. The object was first observed approximately 45 degrees to the right of the nose of my aircraft with an estimated 10 degrees to the right of the most of my aircraft with an estimated 10 degrees above the horizon.
