UNCLASSIFIED
SUBJECT AIR INTELLIGENCE REPORT
Major Field
Spokane, Washington
22 August 1951

SUBJECT: Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft

TO: Commanding General
Air Materiel Command
ATTN: MCINT
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

1. In accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5, Air Defense Command Letter 200-1, 11 April 1951, the following information, which was obtained as the result of an observation of an unconventional aircraft in this area, is forwarded for your information.

2. Description: The object was elliptical in shape, estimated to be approximately 30-60 feet in diameter. It appeared to be silver or aluminum in color. It was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes while it was in view. The object did not make any noise, and no trail or exhaust was observed. If the object was not seen initially, it appeared suddenly, and as it passed over the observers, it appeared to be stationary in the air. The ascent and descent of the object was very slow, approximately 1/2 mile per minute. Observers, when the object was sighted at approximately 40 degrees, estimated the speed of the object to be 500-600 miles per hour. The object started a 80-90 degree climb. The movement of the object was very smooth and steady, and it appeared to be under positive control. The object continued in a steady 80-90 degree climb until it disappeared from view.

3. The object sighted approximately 1100, 20 August 1951. Duration of observation: approximately 2-3 minutes.

4. The object was sighted with the naked eye from the ground. Observer's distance from the object was approximately 2-3 miles. Observers stated no aircraft were seen in the vicinity of the object during the observation.

1. The point of observation was 47 degrees 35' N and 117 degrees 25' W. This location is approximately 2 1/2 miles south of the junction of Ash St. & Maple, Spokane, Washington, at an elevation of approximately 1700 ft. above sea level. The object was first observed to the north at about 1300 and was under observation during the succeeding 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it disappeared from observation.

2. Neither observer professed much knowledge of aircraft, stating that neither one had ever been up in an airplane; however, they claimed to be able to identify various types of aircraft that every day fly over this area.

3. 1150" CIO 050 169/22/17-25/007

a. In the opinion of the observer, neither the weather conditions nor the convective activity nor the specific situation over the area could likely have induced the optical phenomenon observed.

b. The witnesses stated that the object came on the horizon from about the northwest, and seemed to hover and glide at times, but always maintained an altitude of approximately 2000 ft. above the ground, until it disappeared from view by descending gradually over a period of from 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

c. A thorough inspection of the area failed to reveal any tangible evidence of the phenomenon.

4. None.

5. Aircraft observed in local area at time of observation:
The Navy operations at Geiger Field reported negative on any Navy types in the air at the time. No aircraft of any type were sighted in the immediate vicinity at the same time as the unidentified object.

Spokane radio reported the arrival of three aircraft at Geiger Field, two Lockheed Loadstars and one B-26. All are returning from missions via air ways (Blue 5) and at this date were not considered in connection with the unidentified object.
