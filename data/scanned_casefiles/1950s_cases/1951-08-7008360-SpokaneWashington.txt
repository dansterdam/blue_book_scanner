SUBJECT: Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft

       Dayton, Ohio

1. In accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5, Air Defense Command Letter 200-1, dated 11 April 1951, subject as above, the following report of an unconventional aircraft or object, which was sighted in this area, is forwarded for your information.

a. Description:- The object was elliptical and curved to be flat in appearance. Observer judged object to be about two (2) feet long and 8" to 10" in width. Color was white or aluminum. No trail or exhaust was noticed. If object is fitted any noise, none heard. Able to say height was very near to point of observation. When first seen the object was 50 to 75 feet in the air color: straight up slowly.

The point of origin seemed to be at or by 200 north of cross near the bottom of a hill and approximately 1/4 mile from observer. When the object reached a height equal to or slightly greater than the top of the 200-300 foot hill, it changed direction to the south and started a 50-40 degree climb. The move was at all times was very steady and even, no jerky motions, swings or fluctuations being noticed. The object continued in a steady 50-40 degree climb to south until cut off at 200 miles away when disappeared from sight and had appearance then of a star, probably due to sun reflecting on the bright surface of object.

b. Object sighted approximately 1110E, 20 August 1951. Duration of sight was approximately 20 minutes.

c. The object was sighted with the naked eye from the ground only. Speed was very slow and observer unable to judge height when object disappeared from view. Observer stated no aircraft were seen during this observation.

EFC 519.1 Subject: Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft

a. The point of observation was 47 degrees 35' N and 117 degrees 24' W of in Spokane, Washington, approximately 1/4 mile south of the junction of Washington State Highway 395 with Washington State Highway 31. This location is also approximately 7 1/2 miles SE of Colgar Field and on Clear Field (Plat). No object was first seen in respect to the observer was 5/1/4 mile from observation point.

b. Neither observer professed much knowledge of aircraft stating that neither one had even ever been up in an airplane; however, due to their proximity to Geiger Field, they could readily identify various types of aircraft that every day flew over this area.

c. 1150P SEG 050 169/82/179-9/007

d. In the opinion of the station acting officer, neither the convective activity nor the synoptic situation over the area could likely have caused an object this size to float or ascend at the time of incident. The air was dry and stable, no clouds whatsoever being in the area at the time. The witnesses stated that at the point of observation the wind was calm as the clothes on the line were not even fluttering.

e. A thorough inspection of the area from which the object apparently arose was made on foot. No physical evidence or fragments were found.

f. None.

g. Aircraft airborne in local area at the time of observation:

The Navy Operations at Geiger Field reported three Navy SNB's that might have been in the area at the time. The SNB's each landed at Geiger at 1830, 1900, and first at 1255. They might have been airborne at Geiger Field, Seattle, being airborne sufficient time to do some local flying in this area.

Spokane Field reported the arrival of three aircraft at field, two Cessnas landing at 1830, one aircraft arriving at 1850, all arriving from Boise via airways (Chic 2) and all under 5,000'. These aircraft were from Geiger Field airborne at the time of observation.
