TO:     Commander

        P. O. Box 9038
        Fort Worth, Texas

1. Information was received on this subject from Mr. [redacted], an employee of Convair, Department [redacted] who resides at [redacted], Fort Worth, Texas.

2. He advised that at approximately 2115 hours, 9 July 1953, he had just finished a church activity at the Midgerest Baptist Church and was looking the front door of the church in preparation to leaving when he observed a blue, hazy, glowing light northwest from the front of the church which fused in a westerly direction. The blue, hazy light had no definite outline and appeared to be travelling in a southwesterly direction. It changed course and travelled in a westerly direction over a short distance and again changed course to a southwesterly direction. The total time this blue, hazy light was visible was approximately three (3) or four (4) seconds and he was unable to identify a shape or form which might be attributed to the light. Further advised that he was unable to estimate the altitude of the light; however, believed it to be at the same altitude as normal aircraft in flight. He could not state whether or not the blue, hazy light could be attributed to the flying saucer phenomena. He stated that three (3) other persons were present at the time he saw the light and then he also believed saw it. He identified these persons as: Mrs. [redacted], his wife; Mr. [redacted], and a Mrs. [redacted] residing at [redacted], Halton City.

3. For your information [redacted] is believed to be somewhat sensitive about this matter, believing that he might be held up to ridicule at his place of work should his name be used in this connection. He is willing to give any information desired irrespective of any other consideration.

4. The foregoing is submitted for your information in the event that you desire to submit information pursuant to Air Force Letter 200-5.

17 July 1953

UNCLASSIFIED

Please be advised that approximately 2115 hours, 9 July 1953, just having finished a church activity at the Nazarene Baptist Church, I observed one object of a blue or purple color somewhat as a very high rate of speed. There was no close apparent to me. The object maneuvered sharply with the completion of a momentary hovering motion, and disappeared in a northwesterly direction as a very high rate of speed.

I would estimate the period of observation to be three or four seconds. It is further estimated that the object sent over the Lake Worth area and continued to travel and disappear in a northwestern direction. It was impossible for me to give an accurate estimation of the altitude. The object was at an apparent 50 degrees from the point where it appeared to be at the same altitude of a normal airplane in flight. This object was also observed at the same time and in my presence by several individuals in the vicinity of Walton City, and to those residing in the _______ Walton City.
