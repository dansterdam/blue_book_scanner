Portland 15, Oregon
September 13, 1957

United States Air Force
Portland, Oregon - Location

Gentlemen:

On the morning of September 10th I sighted an unusual object in the sky over the city which I feel I should report to you, since it was unlike anything I have over seen.

It was clearly outlined against a bright blue sky at 8:15 AM and was shaped like this:
[A hand-drawn sketch of an oval/elongated disk shape]

It was the color of an electric light as seen thru an opaque white glass shade. I realize that the moon is in that part of the sky in the morning but this bore no resemblance to it except that the color could be compared to the brightest part of the moon at this time of day.

It was traveling west at a speed fast enough to make it appear dimmer as I watched, then it made a right-angle turn to the south and disappeared behind the roof of a house. By the time I got past the house I could no longer find it.

Very truly yours,
[Signature redacted]
(Mrs. F. H.)

P.S. I work at the Northeast YMCA and was on my way to work. I watched it while I walked about 200 ft.
