2. DETAILS: A letter has been received from Mrs. [redacted], Byron Road, R.R. 12, Elba, New York, directed to Offutt Air Force Base, which reads as follows:

Dear Sir,

Since I read the piece in the Buffalo Evening News about the mystery plane, I have been wondering more about it. I think it was around the 12th Jan. my 6 yr. old son looked out the window on some that bright white light. He said, to me, "Mother what is that?" I said, "Oh it's a star." He said, no, its moving fast. Then I looked. I watched it clear out of sight over Batavia, N.Y. The American and Central African 20 over the all the time, but you can see these colored lights blinking. This had just that one bright white light.

Via 14va between Rochester and Batavia, around South Byron. I don't want this in the paper, maybe I was seeing things or don't know more about it until I read it in the paper. Sincerely.
