OKLAHOMA CITY 6, OKLAHOMA 
Dear Mr. ____, 

The sighting referenced in your letter took place on 5 January 1959. The object was seen from two vantage points: airpoit control tower.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center's analyst determined the sighting was of a T-33 jet trainer aircraft. The object was less than ten degrees above the horizon, corresponding to the reported position of the unindustrial.

The fluctuating from red-orange to blue-green coloration of the light from other sources their appearance is this 
in size and a pulsating this distortion. The probable cause for the lack of identifiability of the aircraft was the time of the sighting.

The official report to the Air Technical Intelligence Center made no mention of gun camera pictures being taken of this object. The aircraft from which this sighting was made is a T-33 jet trainer.

Sincerely,

The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Mr. 

The sighting referenced in your letter took place on 5 January 1959. The object was seen from two vantage points, through and near the control tower at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center has determined the object as a material aircraft of apparent unidentified origin. As can be determined from the information and evidence available, the object appears to have been a material aircraft, similar in appearance to and consistent with the report, but differing in minor details. The object was reported to have appeared suddenly above the horizon, disappeared abruptly, and reappeared again. The observer's description would indicate that the object was highly maneuverable, and had the capability of instantaneous acceleration and/or deceleration. This description is consistent with the known characteristics of jet aircraft.

The official report to the Air Technical Intelligence Center made no mention of the reported ability of the object to change color or the reported lack of identification on the part of the observer.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

Gentlemen:

On 9 January 1959, I learned of a report of an Unidentified Flying Object. This report came from Vance AFB, Oklahoma, stating that the UFO had been observed through the control tower's gun-camera. A letter on 9 January 1959, to the Office of Public Information, Vance AFB, requested a copy of the photographs or the film. This information is available, but only from USAF headquarters.

With reference to the above-mentioned report, I grant your request for full information. On 10 January 1959, I received from USAF headquarters the report dated 5 November 1959, and DD5-85-86 dated 9 October 1959. This most certainly did not meet my request for information.

Please return the carbon copy enclosed when you reply.

Sincerely,

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned document containing a letter written by Lawrence J. Tacker, Major, USAF, Executive Information Division, Office of Information Services, Department of the Air Force. The letter is dated February 21, 1959 and is addressed to Major Tacker. The letter discusses the writer's previous letter of February 17, 1959, provides information about the "UFO sighted at Vance Air Force Base, Enid, Oklahoma" on January 9, 1959, and requests the return of the writer's previous letter.

Dear Major Tacker:

Thank you very much for your letter of 17 February 1959, giving the official analysis of the 9 January 1959 sighting at Vance Air Force Base, Enid, Oklahoma. I realize that it is difficult to establish a definite conclusion in some of these cases of reported UFO sightings.

There are two matters I would like to have cleared up, however. One, you mentioned that an article written by me appeared in the December 19, 1959 issue of the National Geographic Magazine. I was not aware that any such article had been written or published under my name. I would like to know the content and title of this article. Second, I also notice that in your letter you stated that you had returned my letter to me with your reply. You neglected to do so. I would appreciate it very much if you would return it with your next reply.

Sincerely,

Lawrence J. Tacker
