Dear Mr. [redacted]

The sighting referenced in your letter took place on 5 January 1959. The object was seen from two vantage points, airport control tower and an aircraft.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center's analyst determined the object of this sighting to be the first magnitude star Fomalhaut. At the time of the sighting Fomalhaut was less than ten degrees above the horizon, corresponding to the reported position of the unidentified flying object. The witnesses described the object as a bright light fluctuating from red-orange to blue-green. Refraction of the light from stars when low on the horizon distorts their appearance; this distortion is normally displayed as a color change, apparent increase in size and a pulsating effect. This distortion is the probable cause for the lack of identification on the part of the witnesses.

The official report to the Air Technical Intelligence Center made no mention of gun camera pictures being taken of this object. The aircraft from which this sighting was made is a T-33 jet trainer.

Sincerely,

17 February 1959

Dear Mr. [redacted]

The sighting referenced in your letter took place on 5 January 1959. The object was seen from two vantage points, airport control tower and an aircraft.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center's analyst determined the object of this sighting to be the first unusual true formulation. At the time of the sighting Townsville was less than ten degrees above the horizon, corresponding to the reported position of the object as unidentified flying object. The visualization described the object as a bright light fluctuating from red-orange to blue-green. Manifestation of the less time color change between the two colors indicates their apparent increase in size and a pulsating effect. This distortion is normally displayed as a color change, this probable cause for lack of identification on the part of the witnesses.

The official report to the Air Technical Intelligence Center was made no earlier than one week being taken of this object. The aircraft from which this sighting was made is a T-33 Jet trainer.

5 JAN 59
ORIG

23 January 1959

Gentlemen:

On 5 January 1959, I learned of a report of an Unidentified Flying Object, from Vance Air Force Base, Enid, Oklahoma. The report stated that the UFO had been unsuccessfully pursued by a jet aircraft from Vance AFB. A rumor has reached me stating that the jet obtained motion pictures of the UFO through it's gun-camera.

In an attempt to learn more information about this report, I addressed a letter on 8 January 1959, to the office of Public Information, Vance AFB. I received a reply, a carbon copy of which is enclosed. This letter states that all UFO information is available, but only from USAF headquarters.

With reference to the above statement, I sent you a letter dated 10 January 1959, with a request for full information on the sighting mentioned. By the letter I received from Vance AFB OPI, on 19 January 1959, I received a reply. This reply was in the form of USAF Form Release 1083-58, dated 5 November 1957, and 896-58 dated 6 October 1958. This most certainly did not meet my request for information. Therefore, I again request full information on the sighting mentioned above.

Please return the carbon copy enclosed when you reply.

Sincerely,

21 February 1959

Dear Major Tacker:

Thank you very much for your letter of 17 February 1959, giving the official analysis of the Air Technical Intelligence Center on the UFO sighted at Vance Air Force Base, Enid, Oklahoma, on 5 January 1959. I realize that it is Air Force policy not to honor "minimal requests for detailed analysis of specific cases", and would like to thank you for making an exception in my case.

There are two matters I would like to have cleared up, however. One, you spelled the name of the star "Tomahault", while the Map of The Heavens, distributed by the National Geographic Society in its December, 1957 issue of the National Geographic Magazine, spells it "Fomalhaut". I cannot find any star spelled the way you spell it.

Also, I enclosed a carbon copy of a letter addressed to myself, from the Information Services Officer at Vance Air Force Base, dated 7 January 1959. In my letter, I requested you to return it with your reply. You neglected to do so. Please return it as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Lawrence J. Tacker

Dear Mr.

As requested, I am returning carbon copy of letter dated 7 January 1959 from Lt. Com. The correct spelling of the star in question is "Fomalhaut."
