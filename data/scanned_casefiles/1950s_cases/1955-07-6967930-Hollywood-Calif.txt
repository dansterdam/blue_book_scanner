The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an "A" marked on the curved line to indicate the point where the observer first saw the object above the horizon. A "B" is also marked on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it.

The second and third sketches show larger scenes. The second sketch depicts a person standing on a road with mountains or hills in the background. The third sketch shows a person standing on a road with a curved horizon line and clouds in the sky.
