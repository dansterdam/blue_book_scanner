30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

When we first saw the objects, naturally thought of "flying saucers" but I do not quite understand what they were. Optical illusions appear to be out of the question, since both Mrs. [redacted] and I saw the phenomena clearly, and any set of reflection, distortion, diffusion seems impossible. Whatever they were, the objects certainly appeared to have substance, solidity, and direction.
