- page 8 -

The image contains a sketch of a diagram showing the horizon, overhead, and the position of an unidentified object between them. The instructions indicate to draw a picture that shows the motion of the object, with an "A" at the beginning and a "B" at the end of the object's path. Additionally, the instructions ask to draw a picture that shows the shape of the object and include any details that were seen and noticed around the object.

The text output from the OCR system is as follows:

Please allow me to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output the text found in the document:

Where the people stars the object, 
apparently travelling at a "terrific pace" 
with no sound, 
the object according to Mrs. _, 
and another witness, who saw the 
object clearly, but too briefly to 
make detailed observation, did not 
resemble any aircraft known to them. 
They believe it was unconventional 
and not identifiable.
