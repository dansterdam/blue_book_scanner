SYNOPSIS
Investigation requested by CG, Lowry AF Base. Unidentified fast moving flame or light was reported to have been observed by Lt. A. P. WEBB, 1859 hours, 18 Jan 50 while flying in vicinity of Denver. Investigation disclosed WEBB and six (6) other pilots from four aircraft observed similar flame or light at times varying slightly. All observers described flame or light in similar terms and gave its course generally as southwesterly. All four military aircraft were airborne in different locations and on various headings when the observations were made by the pilots. Lowry Radar inoperative, 1800-2030, 18 Jan 50. Lowry AFB Training & Operations personnel advised they had no additional experimental aircraft in area, 18 Jan 50. Observation plotted and continuation of course suggest flame or light heading towards Holloman AFB, New Mexico. No ground observations of the flame reported. Weather conditions clear, visibility unlimited.

AT LOWRY AF BASE, DENVER, COLORADO

1. This is a joint investigation of Special Agent FREDERICK K. UNGERER and the writer.

2. This investigation was predicated upon telephonic report by 1st Lt ARTHUR F. WEBB, 1st1424, 346th Student Officers' Squadron, 19 January 1950 who advised that while flying in the vicinity of Denver during the evening of 18 January 1950 he observed a flame move across the sky at a high rate of speed.

3. WEBB was interviewed and stated substantially as follows: WEBB and a Lt. DRYSDALE were flying a T-6 and when they reached a point about 15 miles southeast of Denver, he observed an unusual spectacle. He saw a long streak of flame cylindrical in shape, rounded at the front and tapered towards the rear. It was of a white reddish color with more red in the front. WEBB stated that it moved on an estimated heading of 200 degrees at a high rate of speed without apparent change in altitude or course. WEBB could not estimate the distance to the flame from his aircraft, but estimated the length of it at 100 feet. The flame remained in sight for about 5 seconds and then faded out. The altitude of the flame was estimated as about 5000 feet higher than the observer. WEBB was unable to see any running lights, silhouette or other features. WEBB noted the time of the observation was 1853 hours.

4. 1st Lt DOUGLAS R. DRYSDALE, AO 755895, 346th Student Officers' Training Squadron stated substantially the same as WEBB. DRYSDALE described the flame in the same general terms as WEBB but added that it looked just like a shooting star on a flat trajectory. According to DRYSDALE the time of the observation was 1905 and he estimated the flame to be at an altitude 1500 feet higher than the T-6.

5. WEBB and DRYSDALE both gave their aircraft heading as 190 degrees and their altitude as 6500 feet. Both stated they were on interphone and thus noted no unusual radio noises at the time of the observation. Both pilots stated they had never seen a comparable sight.

6. Captain H.F. DANIEL, AO 559076, Hq & Hq Squadron, 3415th /Technical Training Wing, and 1st Lt. ROBERT F. ROMBERG, 1650LA were flying a C-47 aircraft in the vicinity of La Junta, Colorado on the evening of 18 January 1950. DANIEL and ROMBERG were interviewed and both stated that they had observed a flame or light moving across the sky very fast. DANIEL saw the flame appear at his left and move across his path. He noticed ROMBERG who then saw the flame too. DANIEL and ROMBERG watched the flame fade out at their right. Both pilots estimated the flame to be on a heading of 200 degrees. The flame was described by both as light blue with a tinge of orange and quite long. Both stated they could not estimate the size of the flame or its distance from their aircraft. They estimated the altitude of the flame slightly higher than that of their aircraft. The C-47 was on

DETAILS (cont'd)

a heading of 110-degrees and an altitude of 10,000 feet. The flame was sighted at 1905 and was visible for 15-20 seconds. DANIEL stated the C-47 was about ten-minutes out of La Junta and ROMBERG gave the position as half way between Colorado Springs and La Junta.

7. Captain JOHN W. KREITZ, AO 827009 and Major LYNDALL J. AVERY, 798A, 341st Student Officers' Squadron were flying a C-47 type aircraft on the evening of 18 January 1950. KREITZ stated in an interview that he observed what appeared to be a meteor but larger and slower and maintaining level flight. KREITZ described it as: Light blue in color, similar to that of an oxygen torch. The flame was at an estimated altitude of 25,000-30,000 feet and moving faster than jet-flight. KREITZ estimated the distance from aircraft to the flame as 35 miles. The C-47 was 9000 feet on a heading of 60 degrees at a point about 35 miles northeast of Akron, Colorado when the observation was made. The time was 1900. KREITZ stated the flame was apparently traveling on a heading of 240 degrees and was visible for about 15 seconds before it faded out. Major AVERY did not see the flame.

8. Captain JOHN L. ELLINGER, AO 665025 and 1st Lt. CLINTON C. LEGG, AO 2056029, both of the 341st Student Officers' Squadron, were interviewed 19 January 1950. Both pilots advised that they were flying a T-6 type aircraft at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet on a heading of 60 degrees when at 1858 hours, 18 January 1950, at a point approximately one-half way between Denver and Akron Colorado, they observed a flame traveling at a high rate of speed on a course of approximately 210 degrees. LEGG stated the flame was observed the flame for about 20 seconds and ELLINGER stated that he observed it 5-8 seconds. Both pilots estimated the altitude of the flame at 12,000 feet. Both described it as bright orange, the flame, five to ten miles away and maintaining a straight even course. The flame merely faded from view. ELLINGER estimated its length to be 50 feet and LEGG estimated it to be 50 yards.

9. The positions and headings of the four aforementioned aircraft were plotted on an over-lay of Sectional Aeronautical Charts, Trinidad (S-2), Denver (T-4) and Cheyenne (U-4). A diagram was plotted to show the approximate position and heading of the flame when observed by the pilots of the respective aircraft. The aircraft are numbered on the overlay and carried pilots as follows:
NO.(1) KREITZ and AVERY         NO.(3) WEBB and DRYSDALE
NO.(2) DANIEL and ROMBERG        NO.(4) ELLINGER and LEGG

10. A check with the Denver Bomb Plot, Det. A. 3903d Radar Bomb Scoring Sq., disclosed that their radar was not operating between 1830-2030 hours, 18 January 1950.

11. A check with Base Operations, 341st Technical Training Wing, Training and Operations, and Flight Service Section, all of Lowry AFB, failed to reveal any report of sightings of experimental aircraft in the area.

12. An extension of the course of the flame as plotted in DO #14 area suggests it would pass over the vicinity of Holloman AF Base, New Mexico.

13. Weather conditions in area of observation, evening of January 18, 1953 were clear and visibility unlimited. Some slight electrical disturbance was noted along the horizon.
