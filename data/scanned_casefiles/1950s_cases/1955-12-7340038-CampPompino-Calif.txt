SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with the Hamilton Flight Service Center was made by Det 1, 4602D AISS, for aircraft or balloons in the area at the time of sighting. Negative results.

2. The LICK OBSERVATORY, located on MT HAMILTON (DJPH 2320), was contacted for any unusual astronomical phenomena during that period with negative results.

    Address: Camp Pomponio, California
    Age: 38
    Occupation: Camp Ranger, BSA
    Education: Two (2) years high school
    Qualifications: Unknown

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE had served four (4) years with the US Navy as a cook on a destroyer, with additional duty as a gun-pointer on a 20mm gun. SOURCE tried to be exact and precise, as during the conversation he would repeat and emphasize his statements. SOURCE seemed to be of average intelligence and eager to help in any way that he could. As the only contact with the SOURCE was by telephone it was impossible for the investigator to determine the reliability.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was informed by his wife that, "that thing was there again"; as she was out gathering in her clothes. The sky was clear with many stars visible, the weather cool with a mild breeze. Object was first sighted in the East, and checked for movement by aligning it with some trees. The object was brighter than any stars in the sky. With the naked eye it appeared to be between the size of a pea and pin head, reddish-orange in color and funnel shaped. One end appeared cut off and sharply outlined while the flared end blurred. Flared and seemed to be aprox 1 larger than the clearly outlined end. SOURCE then obtained a 3 inch 16 power Navy type periscope. When viewed through the periscope the object appeared to be blue-red-yellow in color. Object seemed duller than brightly at times. SOURCE established the position as 90 degrees prior to calling the authorities at MOFFET NAVAL AIR STATION, CALIFORNIA, DUNI 5724. During a time lapse of approx 30 minutes, SOURCE returned to check the object and by use of a compass ascertained that the object had moved to 95-100 degrees, and when last viewed the object was in the ESE direction aprox 30 degrees off the horizon.

SOURCE had observed a similar occurrence from 1690002 - 1610002 Nov 55, at which time he sighted two (2) objects, but believing them to be stars did not report the sighting at that time.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the preparing officer, this sighting was probably caused by an unknown planet shining through a thin layer of clouds, giving it a distorted effect. (Some clouds were reported by Dr Jeffers of the Lick Observatory.)

2. The star Ceres also fits the circumstances of this case, however, since its movement is in the wrong direction, i.e., from the southeast diagonally toward the northeast, the direction becomes reversed from that of Source's sighting.

3. Inasmuch as no astronomical reason existed for this sighting, and no balloon release were reported, the conclusion drawn is that course periscope may possibly have tripped leaks, causing the view to become distorted.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting was astronomical in nature but probably caused by the star Betelgeuse rather than by an unknown planet.
