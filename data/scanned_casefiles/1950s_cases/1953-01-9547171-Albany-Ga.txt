1. On 28 January 1953 at approximately 2135 hours, SOURCE observed a unusually bright light northwest of Albany, Georgia. At this time of first sighting, object was circular in shape and SOURCE first thought it was another aircraft or a unusually bright star. Object was white in color, then changed to a bright orange (10,000) feet and the object appeared to be slightly above the aircraft. At the same time SOURCE was flying a T-33 aircraft at approximately 10,000 feet and the object appeared to be slightly below the aircraft. At the same time SOURCE observed the object for three (3) minutes of the observation object constantly changed color, from white to orange and black. The last observation (15) seconds of observation the object changed from circular in shape to triangular and to a deep red color.

2. SOURCE observed the object for approximately seventeen (17) minutes at 2135 hours, 28 January 1953.

3. SOURCE observed the object visually.

4. The point of observation was from a jet type aircraft (T-33) then based at Albany, Georgia; (310/351A/106). Object was on a direct line from Albany, Georgia to Columbus, Georgia. Appeared at all times to be northwest of Albany, Georgia. Object, in relationship to SOURCE, stayed all ways at a port-five (15) degree angle at ten (10) o'clock high.

5. SOURCE appeared willing, in fact he set down his narrative without benefit of questions by the interviewer. No questions on sighting were asked, but questions when asked were answered in an excellent manner. SOURCE has eleven (11) years service will all this as a rated officer. SOURCE is a senior pilot with over three thousand (3,000) hours and is currently assigned as OIC of Base Operations.

6. A check with the Moody Air Force Base weather station confirmed the weather conditions on the night of the sighting to be scattered clouds and ten thousand (10,000) feet. Visibility was eight miles and winds aloft conditions were at north east. A full moon was present at the time of the sighting.

8. A radar contact was made with object by Albany.

9. Narrative. SOURCE made no attempt to intercept or have in object considering it for some time as a possible hazard to flight. Other sources in the area. it nothing unusual in the object except its brilliance.

10. Confirmation was received from the base operations at Moody Air Force Base that aircraft were airborne at the approximate time in the general area of the sighting of the object.

COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:

1. COMMENTS was cooperative and sincere in his statements. He gave his narrative all in one side and did not change his mind on seeing, its coverage of observation seemed above average, perhaps acceptable to (11) years as a rated officer. And could not identify the object that he had sighted.

JOINT MESSAGE FORM

UNCLASSIFIED

FROM: APGN-ATAL-248 FOR DASR WEATHER OFFICE

ATIC is contacting your station regarding an unidentified aerial object sighted north east of Albany, Ga. at 9/0355 Jan 53. It is hoped that you may be able to assist ATIC in explaining this sighting. The object was described as 1) round, 2) changing color repeatedly from white to orange, 3) stationary and observed by Albany Airport radar, visually from the ground and visually from the air.

ATIC requests that you supply any information on possible 0300Z weather balloon launches on this date and include winds aloft, track of the balloon, time of burst, position and altitude as time of burst, lighting of the balloon and possible existence of radar reflector on balloon.

ATIC would appreciate prompt attention to this matter as it feels that such a release may explain subject sighting.

INCIDENT NO. 1-(On January 28, 1953 at 8:35 p.m.) a jet pilot near Albany, Ga., spotted "an extremely bright light" at 10 o'clock high. At first he thought it was a star or another aircraft. But when he went up to 10,000 feet it appeared to be ahead and a little higher. When first spotted, the light was white, but later it began changing constantly from white to orange and a dark to white again. The object was from 17 to 20 miles in the 1st 15 seconds; it changed shape from circular to triangular, and then the triangular split into two triangles - one immediately above the other - and both disappeared as if a light.

The pilot called Albany, Ga. but before he could make his usual 1 line command, asked him if he had seen anything unusual. They advised him that ground radar had picked it up. On the radar scope, when the jet had left the area, the target had stepped up, too, to maintain its lead on him.

At approx 2150 EST, Albany radio called TFB tower and asked the operators on duty to look west of the field and see if they observed any strange objects. They looked out and observed what appeared to be a (one) circular light, glistening colors from glowing orange to white and receding brain wave angle. They observed this object for a period of 8 minutes. From 2150 EST to 2155 EST, then it appeared to either go out or just fade away.

Radar showed this information: One maintenance man who were doing preventive maint. on the set, turned it on and they reported that they picked up 5 or 6 objects on the scope. (3 moving), 1 stationary.

I Unary radio again contacted the TFB tower at approx 2200 EST, and related the following information. (source unknown) A USAF aircraft had reported seeing one object, with two reported that it was a circular white object.

Appears as three objects. This aircraft was enroute from McDill AFB to Warner-Robins AFB, and reported having the objects in sight for 25 minutes.

The pilot of this aircraft reported that at 10,000 feet the objects were below him and they were changing colors.

At approx 2210 EST, the man at the GCA unit contacted the tower and said they had two stationary objects on the scope, one at 27 miles-200 degrees, and the other at 17 miles-300 degrees.

The three tower operators were unable to sight these two objects with a binoculars, or the naked eye.

Notes:
1. The object sighted west of TFB, appeared to be standing still or moving in a direct line.
2. In judging the altitude, it appeared to be about 15 degrees above the horizon. (as judged by the tower men to be approx 2-4,000 feet).
