UNCLASSIFIED
WING INTELLIGENCE, MOODY AFTB, GA.

On 15 January 1953 at approximately 2135 hours, a visual observation of a bright light was made by several individuals who were in the process of leaving the base through the main gate. The light was seen for approximately 5-10 seconds and then disappeared. The light was described as very bright, orange-red in color, and was observed to be traveling in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. At the time of the observation, the weather was clear and the sky was only partly clouded.

2. The object was observed by four individuals, all of whom were officers, and two of whom had been trained as pilots. According to these observers, the object was "definitely not an aircraft, either jet or propeller type." It was described as being much larger and brighter than the average aircraft light. The object was not accompanied by any sound that could be associated with its passage. The time of observation was approximately 2135 hours.

3. SOURCE OR CAUSE OF THE OBJECT VISUALLY OBSERVED: UNCERTAIN.

4. It was first thought that the object might have been an aircraft (C-331) when first sighted, but the object's size, speed, and lack of sound precluded this possibility. The object's speed and lack of any trail or exhaust ruled out the possibility of its being a meteor or similar celestial body. Since its characteristics did not match those of any known type of aircraft or celestial phenomena, the nature of the object must be considered UNCERTAIN.

5. A weather observation at 2135 hours in the area confirmed the following conditions: clear sky, visibility 15 miles, winds light and variable, temperature 47°F, dew point 28°F, and a full moon was present. These conditions would not have obscured or interfered with visual observation of the object.

6. Conditions on the Moody AFB, GA, area at the time of the occurrence were as follows: Weather - clear, visibility unlimited; Wind - light and variable; Temperature - 47°F; Dew point - 28°F; Moon - full. The direction of movement of the object was approximately north.

7. A written contact was made with the object by Albany.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during the 1950s. The document is classified as "UNCLASSIFIED" and discusses an incident related to an observation of a UFO sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

This intelligence report is an attempt to interpret or throw light on an object which apparently was under observation.
The date, time, and location were all fairly definite and careful strides were taken to secure the report and to have the observations and interpretations as accurate as possible.
There was no chance for intercession.

Complete confirmation on details was obtained at the approximate time in the normal area.
COMMENTS OF THE REVIEWING OFFICER:
All indications were cooperative and competent. In this instance, there appears adequate basis for believing the observation was of an actual flying object of significant proportions. There could have been no confusion with any known type of aircraft. This case appears authentic.

JOINT MESSAGEFORM
UNCLASSIFIED 
SPACE ABOVE FOR COMMUNICATIONS CENTER ONLY
TO: CG LAWSON AFB ST D.SMITH GA
INFO: ALBANIA
FROM: APCH-AAFC-3-6-52  FOR BASE WEATHER OFFICE

The text of the message describes an unidentified aerial object sighted north-west of Albany, Georgia, on 3/9/1952. The object was described as 2) round, 2) changing color repeatedly from white to orange, 3) stationary and observed by military aircraft. The message requests any information on possible GECC weather balloon launches during that time, as the object may have been a weather balloon.

The document is marked "UNCLASSIFIED" and "DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 15 YEARS. DOD DIR 5200.10".

3. STATION OF OBSERVING: ALBANY, GA.

The table shows various atmospheric conditions such as altitude, velocity, and direction recorded at different altitudes from 0 to 20,000 feet.

There are also additional notes indicating that an inversion layer was noted at an unspecified altitude, and that there were no thunderstorms or cloud cover during the observation.

INCIDENT NO. 65 on January 28, 1953, at 8:37 P.M.
The incident occurred in Walkinsville, Georgia. The report indicates that the object was described as a bright light, which was apparently stationary, but which then began moving in an erratic manner, making several sharp turns. The object was observed for approximately 45 minutes before it disappeared. The report notes that the object was not visible on radar and that no aircraft were in the area at the time.
