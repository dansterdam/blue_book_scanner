At the top of the document, there is a header "14/18122 FEB RJWFDN"

In the top right corner, there are some handwritten notes: "2", "3", "UFO accept", "a/c", and some other partially illegible writing.

The main body of the text appears to be heavily distorted and mostly illegible. While text is present, the image quality makes it extremely difficult to confidently transcribe the text with accuracy. Large portions of the text are blurred, faded, or obscured.

The bottom of the page has a page number "1" or "4" (it's not entirely clear).
