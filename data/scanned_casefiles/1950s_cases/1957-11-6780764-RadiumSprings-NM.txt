Here is the text from the document:

OFFICERS WERE ON DUTY, SGT ALBRO, AIRMAN BARNES AND
COLLARD, WERE DISPATCHED FROM THIS SQUADRON TO GET
THE COMPLETE STORY. OFFICERS AND
WERE INTERVIEWED SEPARATELY AND THEIR STORIES
COINCIDED AS TO TIME, DESCRIPTION, AND MOVEMENT.

AT THIS TIME A CALL WAS RECEIVED AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS
THAT CAPT. AND OFFICER

Here is 608 cloud coverage, at barton at 10,000 ft.
the mountain is 9000 ft. high and the wind at 10,000 ft
is 35 knots. the moving clouds showing stars
in the breaks, would give an illusion of moving
light.

(Certified Illusion)

PAGE FIVE RJWFDN 3F
HAD THE OBJECTS IN SIGHT. THE AIRMEN PROCEEDED
TO WHERE AND WERE LOCATED 16 MILES
NORTH OF LAS CRUCES. THEY HAD SEEN TWO LIGHTS RISE
FROM THE TOP OF THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS. OFFICER
TARAZON NOTICED THE LIGHT FIRST AS HE THOUGHT IT WAS
A FIRE ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN. WHILE TALKING TO THE
POLICEMEN ANOTHER LIGHT APPEARED ON THE TOP OF THE
MOUNTAIN, RISING SLOWLY, PERHAPS 1,000 FT. PER
MINUTE. THE LIGHT ROSE UNTIL IT WAS LOST IN THE
CLOUD BANK.

IT IS THE OPINION OF THIS OFFICER, T/SGT ALBRO,
AND OTHER U.S. AIR FORCE PERSONNEL INVOLVED THAT THE
OBJECT OBSERVED WAS MERELY A STAR RISING FROM BEHIND
THE MOUNTAINS. THE TWO PREVIOUS OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED
AT THE SAME POINT AND IT IS OUR CONCLUSION THAT THESE
WERE ALSO STARS.
