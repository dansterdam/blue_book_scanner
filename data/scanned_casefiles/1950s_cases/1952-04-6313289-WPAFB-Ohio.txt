The image appears to contain a document page from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page does not contain any photographs, but rather a written report of a sighting of an unidentified aerial object.

Report of Sighting
On April 20, 1952, between 1325 and 1330, Capt. [redacted] and Lt. [redacted], both of whom reside in [redacted], Ohio, observed an unidentified aerial object. Capt. [redacted] first observed a bright object which reflected light 45째 above the horizon in the east. The object was on an E to W course and was observed for 15-20 seconds. During this time its size, shape, and color did not change. The object remained flat and long and was about the size of a jet at a mile or mile and a quarter distance. It exhibited no trail or noise and went out or sight still considerably above cloud level.

About halfway through the observation, Capt. [redacted] called Lt. [redacted], who came out and observed the object for an extremely short period. The weather at 1830 was as follows:
5,000 scattered
7,000 broken
10 miles visibility
76 temperature
49 dew point
Wind V at 10 knots
