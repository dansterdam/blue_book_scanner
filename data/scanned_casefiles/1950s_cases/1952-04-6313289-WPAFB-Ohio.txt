Report of Sighting

On April 20, 1952, between 1815 and 1820, Capt [redacted] and Lt [redacted] both of whom reside in [redacted] AFB, Ohio, observed an unidentified aerial object. Capt [redacted] first observed a bright object which reflected light 45° above the horizon in the east. The object was on an E to N course and was observed for 15-20 seconds. During this time its size, shape and color did not change. The object remained flat and long and was about the size of a jet at a mile or mile and a quarter distance. It emitted no trail or noise and went out of sight still considerably above cloud level.

About half-way through the observation, Capt [redacted] called Lt [redacted] who came out and observed the object for an extremely short period. The weather at 1830 was as follows:
