UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Unusual Sightings in Pacific Area
HQUSAF, Washington 25, D.C.
18 April 1952

CAPTAIN, USAF
Aviation Cadet Howard G. Low, stationed at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa reported the following sightings:
On 6 and 7 March 1952, from 2030 to 2130 hours, at an unspecified location in the Pacific Ocean about 500 miles SW of Kadena Air Base, he and crew members observed several white smoke trails, trailing behind objects which were dark in color. The objects were in sight for about 4 to 5 minutes, and appeared to be between 10,000 and 15,000 feet. No clouds were in the area and the sea was calm. A search was made in the vicinity of the sightings, but the objects could not be located.

On 12 March 1952, from 2115 to 2130 hours, near the same location, he and his crew again observed 3 to 4 white trails, behind fast moving dark objects. The objects were sighted at an estimated 10,000 feet and were observed for 4 to 5 minutes.

In each of the above cases the Hawaiian Sea Frontier was provided full details by the observers.

APPROVED:
