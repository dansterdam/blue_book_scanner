SUMMARY (Confidential information paragraph. List inclosures at lower left. Single text of report on AF Form 112-Part (A))

Call from a Mr. Holloway, resident, Kent County Aeronautics Administration, Kent County Airport, Grand Rapids 8, Michigan. Concerning an unusual flying object he had observed at 10:32, 27 April 1952, Grand Rapids, Coordinates 42°59'48"N 85°49'18"W. Mr. stated that while driving west along the north boundary of Kent County Airport, he observed in a somewhat clear sky a very bright white object which could have been a disc or spherical in shape and appeared in size about equal to a ping pong ball held at arm's length.

Mr. [REDACTED] turned south along the west boundary of Kent County Airport, marked and turned off his motor then disappeared to note if the object could be heard. At this point he got a really good view directly west of him and the sun was no obstacle. It appeared to him that the object was traveling in a south southeasterly direction at an estimated rate of speed, several hundred miles per hour. There was no audible sound, no vapor trail and no visible exhaust, no flames that he could detect.

Mr. [REDACTED] stated that as to altitude it would be most difficult to estimate since he didn't know the size of the object but it seemed to fly in a pronounced arc and on a very low course which lead him to believe it was between forty and fifty thousand feet. The phenomenon was visible for approximately sixteen or seventeen seconds and grew progressively smaller as it headed toward the southeast portion. From the moment he sighted this object until it was no longer visible, he said it covered about five eighths of the horizon. An estimate of the speed is said to be about 1500 miles per hour. There were no other objects sighted so it is assumed the flight was solo.

The weather at the time of the sightings was as follows: At 07:00 - Clear - Visibility 15 miles - Temp 49°. Dew Pt 32°. Wind south 6 MPH. At 08:00 - Clear - Temp 59°. Dew Pt 32°. Wind south 7 MPH.

No known military or commercial aircraft were active over the area concerned.

Check of radar stations in area indicates no record of electronic observation of object.
