       vehicle, and attention called to the driver who leaned forward and
       glanced up through the right front portion of the windshield and
       then moved the vehicle approximately 20 feet in a 90 degree turn
       which put the vehicle headed west and observation continued through
       the left door window.

5.    Object appeared bright and glittering. This attracted attention.

6.    Number of objects and sketch of formation or grouping: One. See
       sketch attached.

7.    Apparent size (compare to known object, i.e., sun, moon, thumb or
       fist at arm's length): Described as appearing; to be as large as
       ordinary dishpan 18 inches wide by 5 inches deep as the dishpan
       would appear at about 15 feet distance.

8.    Color of object: bright aluminum.

9.    Shape (give graphic description - compare with known object):
       Object appeared to be spherical in shape when first observed but
       as it got farther away the appearance changed so as to make it
       look flat on top and bottom and rounding on sides, similar to two

COMMENTS of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observers: The character and integrity of the observers is beyond reproach. Both are employed in supervisory capacities and possess above normal intelligence. A doctor does not wear glasses, and medical records show he has 20/20 vision. Both observers while viewing the object were looking through either a glass window of a door or a glass windshield. Both observers are positive there was no sound, no flare, rings, projections, antenna, etc., and that they did not see any vapor, exhaust smoke, or trail, nor did either call any order.
