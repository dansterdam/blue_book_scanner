1. On the night of 5 April 1952 at 2115 EST, Mr. [redacted] of Florida observed four (4)
unusual objects pass through the sky. Mr. [redacted] was at his home (in net walk)
a report promptly but notified the Andrews Officer of the 4350th
Troop Carrier Wing (M) on his following day telephone. The
report was relayed to the Wing Intelligence Officer who visited
Mr. Van Doren and obtained his account of the incident as outlined
below.

2. Mr. [redacted] and his nine year old son were lying in
hammocks in the yard of their home, gazing at the sky. His son
is interested in astronomy, and owns a small telescope, but was not
using it at the time. There was a rather heavy haze in the atmosphere
at this time, enough to throw a large ring around the moon which was
almost full. There were a dark shape, quite vividly, partially
a dark shape passed across the lower edge of the moon. It was followed
by a second shape which crossed the upper edge of the moon. This
was followed by a fourth shape which passed directly across the moon's
direetly across the face of the moon. These objects were circular,
dark, completely opaque, and were invisible except when outlined
against the moon. The one which passed directly across the moon
completed the passage in approximately one (1) second. The diameter,
from the observer's point of view was about half the moon's diameter.
That is, superimposed upon the face of the moon, it blocked out about
half the moon's span. (See attached free-hand sketch made by
Mr. Van Doren). The objects moved from west to east. Its leading
edge was sharply defined, but a fuzzy corona surrounded about 300
degrees of its outline, which was perfectly circular. No light nor
noise emanated from the objects.

3. Although these (3) of the objects were only seen partially,
Mr. [redacted] was quite sure that they were all in a same area and shape.
His son also saw one of the objects but saw it as an irregular shape
rather than circular. However, it is felt that his father's observations were more accurate. Since he is a competent artist and as
he said, "accustomed to noticing shapes".

4. Comment by 135th Wing Intelligence Officer: There is no
reason to believe that the observations of Mr. [redacted] were not
accurate. He impressed the interviewer as being better qualified

than the average observer and certainly seemed level headed and
unemotional in making his report. His intelligence is pretty
above average. He stated that he had been observing the clouds at
every opportunity for three or four years in the hope of seeing
flying saucers, but that now after seeing them for the first
time, he was disappointed because they were less spectacular than
he had anticipated. He said that they seemed almost a natural
phenomenon, except for the perfectly circular shape and the
fact that they appeared to be flying in formation. There was no
method of judging their altitude because there were no clouds or
other reference points.

sighting anything else of interest.

5. No other persons have reported sighting the same objects.

One minute later two more objects were sighted flying in formation along same course from the East, and disappearing to the West. Five minutes later two more objects were sighted flying in formation with same observation. All two objects were each observed to have the same characteristics namely: (1) elliptical in shape (2) approximately 2-3 feet long (3) noiseless (4) no trail of sparks or flame (5) brilliant white light that blinked at regular interval of one or two seconds similar to running lights on conventional aircraft (6) covered course from East to West in approximately 5-10 seconds with estimated speed at 1000 knots (7) objects flew straight and level course. Said observation was reported to the officer of the day in MATS terminal by 1st Lt Herbert E. Johnson.

    d. Observation: Unidentified flying object observed at an approximate altitude of 20,000 feet flying an erratic course from position on North horizon to Base Area and then disappearing to the West. The object was observed to approach the base flying a straight and level course on and then maneuvered over the base with violent high speed zig-zagging stopping momentarily and then maneuvering. Finally object was up out of sight heading West. Total time of observation was ten (10) minutes. The object was observed to have the following characteristics, namely: (1) white steady light (2) no definite shape but larger than the stars (3) noiseless (4) no trail of sparks or flame (5) from larger and brighter on approach and smaller and dimmer ascending and breaking away. (6) all maneuvering done at speeds higher than any conventional jet aircraft - estimated at 1000 knots.
