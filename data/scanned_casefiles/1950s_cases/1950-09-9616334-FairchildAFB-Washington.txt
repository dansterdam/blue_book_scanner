11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was a brilliant white light approaching the car from the Northeast. The light was moving at "high speed" and came at the car directly as though it was going to hit. According to observers, the light increased in size (from that of an auto headlight) to a very large size, making a fiery trail appearing in various color other than bluish-white which is what it was initially.

1. Attached are three (3) instances of sightings of unusual aerial objects by personnel of FAFU. In two instances the sightings were made by rated officers and all three individuals are considered competent and reliable.  

2. Due to the fact that no satisfactory explanation of these sightings appears and the near coincidences of times and dates, they are forwarded for your information and/or forwarding to appropriate agency.

3. Aircraft, aircraft landing lights, jet trails, meterites and other natural phenomena have been ruled out as explanations by this Headquarters.

4. Request instructions as to reporting procedure in case of future sightings.
