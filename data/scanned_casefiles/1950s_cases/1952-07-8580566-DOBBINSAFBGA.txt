Here is the text I can read from the document:

DOBBINS AFB GA

1

Unidentified blip pace passes on marking target being tracked by ground radar unit.

Some text in the header area is partially illegible, but the above is what I can clearly make out.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

The bottom of the document shows some dates:
1952 JUL 9
1952 JUL 12
1952 JUL 15

The document appears to be a technical chart or graph with gridlines and numerical values, but many of the specific numerical values are difficult to read clearly.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

CITY BLOCK

MODIFIED CANT LEVEL

[The rest of the text is largely illegible due to the poor quality and low contrast of the scanned document. The image appears to be a data table with multiple rows and columns, with some headers visible, but the specific text within the cells is not clearly readable.]

At the bottom of the document, there are some partially legible lines that seem to read:

POOL OF SPACE OF TRANSMISSION
[Followed by several lines of text that are too blurry to confidently transcribe]


- page 4 -

The text I can clearly read is:

800
850
900
1050

At the bottom of the page there are some numbers/text but they are partially illegible:

1952
101
[illegible text]
[illegible text]

The document appears to be a grid or chart with gridlines and some numerical values, but much of the text at the top of the page is too blurry to read with certainty.


- page 5 -

Additional radar data is needed to evaluate this target. It would be of much value to know if unidentified target(s) was on the exact same line of sight as the wind finding target. If on the same line of sight a possible explanation would be a malfunction of the radar set.

Most of the text in this document is too illegible to read clearly. The document appears to be a data grid or chart with rows and columns, typical of a 1950s record-keeping document. There are some faint markings and numbers visible, but the overall quality of the scan makes precise text extraction impossible. The document seems to be a form or log sheet with a grid-like structure, but the specific details cannot be discerned with confidence.


- page 8 -

The text in this image is largely illegible due to the low contrast and grid-like background. There are some numbers and markings on the left side of the document, but they are not clearly readable. The document appears to be some kind of data or tracking sheet with a grid pattern and several white circular markers placed at various points on the grid. The bottom of the page has some text boxes and handwritten notes, but the specific content cannot be discerned with certainty.


- page 9 -

This case includes two(2) 16"x15" photographic charts.


- page 10 -

Text found in the image:

APPARATIC CRAFT
MEAN SIG

The rest of the document appears to be a grid or chart with numerical values and columns, but the text is too small and blurry to read clearly. The top of the page has some faint numerical markings like 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, but they are not completely legible.


- page 11 -

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

DATA BLOCK A

TEMPERATURE

REMARKS POINTS
(Including
Correction)

SIGNIFICANT TIME

(Various numerical entries in multiple columns, mostly illegible due to image quality)

At the top right of the document, there is a section labeled "CONSTANT PRESSURE DATA"

The bottom of the document has a section labeled "COORDINATES OF TRANSMISSION"

Most of the text and numerical entries are very difficult to read clearly due to the low contrast and grainy nature of the scanned document. The overall structure appears to be a data recording sheet with multiple columns for temperature, time, and other measurements.


- page 12 -

The text in this document is largely illegible due to the dense grid pattern and low contrast of the image. There are some numbers visible at the bottom of the page, including coordinate or angle measurements ranging from -90° to 0°. There is a small box with some text in the bottom center of the page, but the text within it is not clearly readable. The page appears to be some kind of technical chart or graph with multiple white circular markers positioned across a gridded background.
