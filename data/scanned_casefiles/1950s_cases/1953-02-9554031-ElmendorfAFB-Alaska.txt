10. CONCLUSION
Sighting resembles balloon launch observation

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Large red light appeared to be moving and observed to the west and southwest at 1500' initially climbing a speed estimated above 1500 ft. per min. As the object descended, it held speed diagonally. We did not observe the object after 1630 hours. A steady white disc was also sighted in the same general vicinity. Report is important to further balloon launching activities, a similar sighting was made on 14-15 June 1952, 170-180°.

AF FORM 112-PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: CG 10th Air Div (Def) APO 942                      LOAD-4-53                      PAGE 2 OF 2

At approximately 13/0455 February 1953 an unidentified red light was sighted in the vicinity of Elmendorf AFB by the following members of the 39th Air Police Squadron: A/2C JAMES R. ODOM, AF 13354875, A/2C NEWELL W. WILTFONG, AF 13 796 441, A/3C AUGUSTUS J. WORMUTH, AF 23 746 279, A/3C ROBERT A. WOOD, AF 27 011 420, and A/3C NORMAN S. MOTTS, JR., AF 12 342 975.

The object is described as a large red light, estimated to be thirty-six (36) inches in diameter from a distance of 3,500s of a mile and an altitude of 1,500 feet. Its shape was not clearly defined, but appeared to be round. It emitted no sound and was there any discernible trails of exhaust patterns. Weather at time of sighting was a measured 3,500 feet overcast, visibility 10 miles, wind 15-16 knots from 170 to 185 degrees.

The object first appeared approximately at the west end of runway 05. At the time of the initial observation its altitude was estimated to be 1,500 feet. However it was described as climbing gradually and was traveling at a most unusual manner.

One fighter interceptor was scrambled in an effort to intercept. As the jet became airborne there was a noticeable increase in the speed of the object. When it reached a point midway across the arm, the object climbed vertically and at an excess of any jet observed by the airmen and disappeared from sight. The fighter reported no contact at any time. A nearby radar site was alerted and was operational during the entire period.

The duration of the sighting was five (5) to ten (10) minutes. No weather balloons were released during the period. All airmen have previously observed falling stars and declared the sighting did not resemble such natural phenomenon. A similar sighting was made the previous evening, see 10-A-3- 53, but was unknown to the airmen.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
All persons who could have knowledge of this sighting have been interrogated.
The light still remains unidentified.

SUMMARY:
A large red light, approximately thirty-six (36) inches in diameter, was reported by six Air Policemen at 13/0455 Feb 53 as crossing Elmendorf AFB and the city of Anchorage, and then disappearing in a vertical climb. No identification has been established.

[Additional paragraph text, partially illegible]:
The following night, about 9 p.m. five Air Police on patrol spotted the same or similar red light near the end of one of the runways. By comparing it to a known light as a reference, they judged it to be similar. The light was in full view it was at a low altitude. The Air Police called the tower and other personnel to observe. As it had nothing unusual characteristics, the object showed a noticeable increase in speed, and then the jet came around to get an interceptor course. The light climbed vertically into the overcast at 3500 feet.
