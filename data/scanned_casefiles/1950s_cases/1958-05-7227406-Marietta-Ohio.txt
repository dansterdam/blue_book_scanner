INFORMATION FROM SHERIFF DEAN ELLIS:

The Sheriff stated that Mr [redacted] was not known to him personally and that there were no records of him on file in the sheriff's office or city police station. After finding out that Source lived at [redacted], the sheriff said that this place was owned by a Mrs [redacted], a women who had been involved in a murder not long ago. He said that this women was not very reliable and was believed to be operating a house of ill repute. The sheriff said that no information should be given to this women about the Source.

INFORMATION FROM MRS [redacted]

A check was made at the house of Mrs [redacted] to see if the Source was there. She said that she made the Source leave her house about two months ago because he seemed to be a very odd person and she didn't like him around the house. She said that he would stay in the house all day and then go out at night with a telescope and stay until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. She gave the new address at where he was staying as [redacted]. Source was eventually located at this address.

INFORMATION FROM MR [redacted], OWNER OF SOURCE'S RESIDENCE AT [redacted]

Mr [redacted] stated that the Source was presently living at his house. He said that the Source had no visible means of support; however, the Source had told him that he had been left some property in W.Va. and SE Ohio, by an uncle who died and that this is his only means of support. He also stated that he never goes out during the day but goes out [redacted] every night and returns about 1:00 - 2:00 AM. Source told Mr [redacted] that there may be some one calling by telephone or in person to see him and to take their address or phone and he would call]. Mr [redacted] also stated that he thought the Source acted rather odd at times and was not too happy about his residing at his home.

INFORMATION FROM MR DENNIS HURST, POSTMASTER OF MARIETTA, OHIO

During a telephone call from M/Sgt Bluemel to the Postmaster the following information was given:

Mr [redacted] stated that approximately one year ago an official telegram came from Denver Colorado, to the post office of Marietta, Ohio. The Postmaster knowing that the Source had no telephone number took it to his house and tried to deliver the message.

Upon his arriving the Postmaster heard the radio playing and knocked on the door. The radio was shut off but no-one came to the door. The Postmaster knowing that someone was home knocked at the door again. Eventually Source came to the door and inquired who was there. The Postmaster identified himself and stated that he had an official telegram from Denver Colorado addressed to the Source and asked Source to open the door.

Source refused to open the door so the Postmaster departed without delivering the message. The Postmaster then went to the neighbors' and asked what type of men lived there and why he wouldn't open the door. He was told by the neighbors that the person living there was a "Queer Character" who kept the blinds closed all day and never left the house. The Postmaster then reported this incident to the Marietta City Police.

After receiving this information the sheriff was asked to contact the City Police Dept. to see if this incident had been recorded. No entry of this incident was found the officer on duty at that time.

I. SOURCE:
Address: [redacted], Marietta, Ohio
Age: 40
Occupation: Unemployed
Education: High School Graduate, 2 years of College, LAC, UCLA and USC.
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: During the interview Source was very inconsistent in his story. He could never stay within the general line of questioning but varied from subject to subject. He was somewhat familiar with different types of U.S.F. and civilian aircraft but when questioned on UFOBs he would switch to the bizarre and would refer to the type of flying vehicles illustrated in Science Fiction literature.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At 00:05 EST, 9 May 1958, Source was atop a hill just south of Marietta, Ohio, when he sighted the object just north of Parkersburg, W. Va., traveling from east to west. He described the object as having four (4) lights, amber-white in color, in front and one (1) bright white light, not flashing, in the rear. Source said the object appeared to be approximately three miles away, and the size of a small type aircraft (Piper Cub). Source also stated that the object was traveling at a speed of plus or minus 50 miles per hour. Source also stated that the object did not make any sound and that the weather was clear with no wind.

He said that he had observed this object twice before, twice on 9 April 1958 and once on 24 April 1958. Both times the sighting was for approximately five (5) minutes. All sightings were done with the aid of binoculars and telescope.

Source said that the only difference between the three sightings was the color of the rear light from white to a reddish-white. In Source's opinion this object was an occupied or unoccupied vehicle from outer space and from a planet other than earth.

[Handwritten note at bottom: Source did not see the object but based his estimate of size & spacing of lights]

1. After making a local routine investigation it was decided by the investigators that there was not enough information available to determine what the object was that Mr [redacted] sighted. Therefore the investigators proceeded to the area of sighting and the following information was recorded.

2. At 0800, 13 May 1958, Capt Hoffman was contacted at the Filter Center in Charleston W.Va., and stated that after checking all observation posts in the area of sighting, no unusual sightings were called in during 8 and 9 May 1958, also that he had not received a UFOB report in over two months.

3. At 1045, 13 May 1958, the investigators reported to 1st Lt Miller, adjutant of the 783rd ACW Squadron, Guthrie AFS, W.Va. They were then taken to Capt Schwarz, Chief Controller, and a complete check of all tracks and radar scope reading were made for a period of four hours before and after the time given for the UFOB sighting. All tracks were identified by the Chief Controller and there were no indications of a UFOB in the reported area during 8 and 9 May 1958.

4. At 1240, 13 May 1958, the investigators departed Guthrie AFS and proceeded to Marietta, Ohio. They arrived at Marietta, Ohio, at 1510, 13 May 1958, and reported to Sheriff Leon Ellis, Sheriff of Washington County, Ohio. A check was made and it was found out that the Source had given an erroneous address on the report. A further check was made with the Post Office and it was found out that the last address given by Source was at [redacted] Marietta, Ohio. After checking the above address it was found out that Source had moved to [redacted]. A check was made at the new address and no one was at home. After checking with neighbors it was found that the owner of the home was at work. The owner was contacted at his place of employment and confirmed the fact that the Source was living at his home as a roomer. The Source was then contacted at approximately 1845, 13 May 1958, and taken to the Town Motel for an interview regarding the UFOB he reported.

5. The Source was quite cooperative; however, immediately before the interview began, Source informed the investigators that he/know [partially illegible text] rights as an [illegible text]

6. After having talked to the Sheriff, the Postmaster and the last two Landlords where Source had lived, and also after a complete interview with the Source it was then determined that the report Source had made was a complete fabrication or a figment of his imagination. He had no visible means of support, stating that he received money from income property from an uncle that had died. It was also impossible to find out where this property was because every time Source was asked this question he would give a different answer.

7. Source also stated that he had been a member of APRO from 1955-57 and a member of NICAP from January 1957 until the present time.

The following is a probable definition of APRO and NICAP as given by Source:
APRO: Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, located in California.
NICAP: A UFOB Club established by Donald E. Keyhoe.

Source stated that he had paid $10.00 to NICAP and all he ever got were a few booklets. He also thought it was the United States Air Force that had restrained NICAP from doing the job it was intended for, mainly located and investigating the real flying saucers and where they came from.

8. Source also stated that he was a high school graduate and had 2½ years of college at LACC, UCLA, AND USC; however, after having talked to the Source it was the opinion of the investigators that the educational level of Source was not as he stated.

9. Information from Sheriff Dean Ellis: The sheriff stated that Mr [illegible] was not known to him personally and that there were no records of him on file in the sheriff's office or city police station. After finding out that Source lived at [illegible], the sheriff said that this place was owned by a Mrs [illegible] who had been involved in a murder not long ago. He said that this women was not very reliable and was believed to be operating a house of all repute.

I. DESCRIPTION OF SOURCE: Mr. [redacted], United States citizen, is a resident of Marietta, Ohio, and lives at 705J Second Street. He is 40 years old, recently unemployed. He is a graduate of a high school and noted that he attended college at LOS ANGELES CITY COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES, and University of SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA for a 2½ year period. SOURCE appeared to be of average intelligence but somewhat odd in behavior. The interviewer had considerable difficulty in locating his place of residence. Apparent reason was a somewhat "flying saucer" organization and an enthusiasm for science fiction. He stated that he belongs to the "NICAP" (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) a USGB Club organized by Donald E. Keyhoe, author of several USGB books.

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: The interviewer attempted to judge SOURCE's reliability regarding the report and his attitude. SOURCE was familiar with some types of aircraft and stated that he had worked as a weight and balance analyst. Without being asked, he apparently was attempting to add credibility to his statements. The interviewers felt that SOURCE was very cautious in his opinion the objects he sighted were "occupied or unoccupied vehicles from outer space and from a planet other than earth." SOURCE stated the interviewer found "the recently reported local sheriff called a 'house of ill repute'". In his initial report SOURCE was vague about the local sheriff. SOURCE was asked to move at least twice because of his peculiarities, such as never leaving his room and having the same drawn shades all night long and staying until early morning. SOURCE was inconsistent in his statements. His manner of talking made it difficult to believe his claims that he attended college. He was very prejudiced against the United States Air Force which he said "restricted" the NICAP (a USGB Club) from locating and investigating the real flying saucers. It is the interviewer's opinion that SOURCE saw what he wanted to see and that his imagination was a paramount reason for reporting the sighting. The information he reported is too scanty for any analysis and most of it is based on wishful-thinking rather than actual observation. Consequently, the reliability of SOURCE is considered extremely poor.

III. REPORTED SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 9 May 1958, at 0005 EST, he was located at hill just south of Marietta, Ohio, west of Virginia. The lights were traveling in formation from east to west. He described the lights as four amber-white, followed by one bright-white. SOURCE described these lights as covering an area the size of a light aircraft (Piper Cub) traveling at an estimated speed of 50 miles per hour from east to west. He said the vehicle was clean, he stated he sighted the lights twice on 9 April 1958 and once on 24 April 1958. Each time the duration of sighting was about five minutes. SOURCE said he made no check with binoculars and a telescope. He believed the lights were on vehicles from a planet other than earth. SOURCE did not actually see any objects, just the lights.

IV. ROUTING CHECKS: The interviewer contacted the GOC Filter Center at Charleston, West Virginia. There were no unusual sightings reported on 8 and 9 May 1958, a check with 783rd ACW Squadron at Guthrie AFS, West Virginia, did not indicate any unusual activity on 8 and 9 May 1958. The weather office at WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, Dayton, Ohio, stated that the weather during the reported time and in the area of sighting was clear with five miles visibility.

V. COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER: The information presented by S. URGE originated specifically from a sighting of a conventional or jet aircraft. The estimate of the speed is a rough approximation by an unqualified observer at an unknown distance. SOURCE's connections with USAF "Fan Clubs", his utilities of character, and the manner in which he describes the sighting are convincing factors that the reported UFOre were probably not unusual in any sense. SOURCE's impressionistic description bears little if any credibility.

UFO OBSERVERS INSTRUCTION SHEET
(Sky Diagram)

1. GENERAL:

a. The diagram represents all of the sky normally visible to the observer, who is pictured standing under the center of the "dome" of the sky. It is designed to show a three-dimensional view of the area centered around the observer at the time of the UFO sighting.

b. The position of any object in the sky can be described by giving its elevation, or angle upward from the horizon, and its bearing or angle along the horizon, eastward from north.

(1) Illustrations:

(a) Elevation is 0 degrees for an object on the horizon, and 90 degrees for the point directly over the observer (zenith). Thus, an object half-way up from the horizon to the zenith has an elevation of 45 degrees.

(b) Bearing (or "azimuth") is the angle along the horizon, starting from north and moving clockwise eastward. Thus, an object directly toward the east, no matter what its elevation is above the horizon, has a bearing of 90 degrees. An object in the south has a bearing of 180 degrees, toward the west, 270 degrees and so on. North is, of course, zero.

EXAMPLE: An object is seen in the northeast and one-third way up from horizon to overhead. Thus, the object has a bearing of 45 degrees, and elevation of 30 degrees. Similarly, an object having a bearing of 180 degrees and an elevation of 60 degrees would be seen directly south and two-thirds of the way up from the horizon.

2. PLOTTING THE COURSE OF AN OBJECT ON THE SKY DIAGRAM:

a. The path of an object across the sky can be shown completely on this diagram simply by connecting with a curved or straight line the various positions the object successively occupies (see example sheet). To aid visualization, the path on the western side of the sky is represented by broken lines; the eastern side in blue lines. The direction of the sighting can be shown by indicating the time at the position where the object was first and last observed. Where possible, the time at various intermediate positions occupied by the object should also be shown.

b. The diagram can be made a more effective investigative and analytical tool by making the lines (showing the path of the object) thicker or thinner to indicate any varying brightness of the object observed. This is especially valuable when the object appeared only as a moving light at night. Thus, if a light becomes brightly and then gradually fades, it can be represented by a line becoming increasingly thicker and then gradually thinning out to nothing.

c. Use of colored pencils is especially recommended if the object changes color or hue during the sighting.

- page 23 -

3. EXAMPLE OF DIAGRAM USE:

a. Verbal Description of Example Sighting: Object was first sighted in the southeast, about half-way up from the horizon to overhead, at 10:45 IM local time. Its shape or outline was hazy, but appeared round and about the size of a pea (at arm's length) from where observed. It was dim at first but brightened considerably as it got higher in the sky. Its color at this point was bluish white. After about two minutes it crossed the western part of the sky a little to the north of overhead (zenith) and continued its flight toward the west. At this point its color appeared yellowish white. The light went dim when it got two-thirds of the way to the horizon. It then stopped and hovered for about one minute and then climbed rapidly, going toward the southwest and getting brighter. In less than thirty seconds, it had climbed to an elevation of approximately 60 degrees, and then the light went out abruptly.

b. Pictorial Description of the Sighting: By referring to the example sheet, notice how simply the above sighting can be portrayed and described, without words, on the example diagram attached here. Note the starting point at bearing 135 degrees (southeast) and elevation 45 degrees (half-way up from the horizon) at 10:45 PM (military time, 2245), and the arrow marking direction of flight. Note also the varying thickness of the line to denote changes in brightness, and the use of the dotted line to indicate its path in the western part of the sky. The "time indications" along the path - 2 minutes to get to the meridian (the north-south overhead line), the hovering for 1 minute, and the ascent in 30 seconds to its complete disappearance, are all shown with a few lines. Thus, the entire sighting can be represented easily on one diagram.

4. FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS AND INFORMATION:

a. Relatively complex trajectories can easily be shown on a diagram of this type. A number of objects sighted can also be indicated, as can any changing formation. The apparent size and shape of the object should be drawn in, preferably by the observer. In the case of an object changing shape or color, this likewise can be drawn in. As previously pointed out, the use of colored pencils to indicate change of color is very desirable.

b. The landscaping in the sky diagram is placed there to help visualization. If any prominent landmarks such as known mountains, buildings, water towers, or specific installations, trees, etc., are part of the sighting area, they should be incorporated into the drawing. These landmarks may later prove to be invaluable, plotting or reference points.

c. If you are familiar with the constellations or other heavenly bodies, indicate if possible, the relationship (and movements) of the object with respect to these bodies. This can be sketched on either page 6, item 33 or pages 9-10 of "Summary Data" sheet. Typical examples that can be easily illustrated: "...Object seemed to pass very slowly between the two bottom stars on the handle of the Big Dipper, which was in a vertical position, with the handle pointing down," or "...Object was about the size of a tennis ball -- and remained slightly below and about 15 degrees to the left of the moon."

Upon receiving a request to investigate a UFOB, in the area of Marietta, Ohio, from Capt Gregory at ATIC, M/Sgt Bluemel and M/Sgt Nickerson made a preliminary check with 4717 GOC, Base Weather, and 58th Air Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.

A check made at Base Weather established that the weather at Marietta, Ohio, during the period of sighting indicated clear skies with a 5 mile visibility. A check made with 4717GOC at WPAFB indicated that the Filter Center at Charleston W.Va. had not reported any unidentified sighting during the period of sighting. A call was made by Capt Hendrick from the GOC at WPAFB to Capt Hoffman at the Filter Center in Charleston W. Va., to ask him to make a complete check of all observation posts in the area of sighting.

Sgt Bluemel and Sgt Nickerson then talked to Lt Col Bennett, the D/I for the 58th Air Division at WPAFB. He said that the nearest AC&W site to the sighting was the 783rd AC&W Sq located at Guthrie AFS, Guthrie W.Va. Lt Col Bennett also stated that the report was phoned direct to WPAFB from Marietta, Ohio, and received by Lt Col Delmar I. Mc Crecken at AMC Command Post. Lt Col Mc Cracken then forwarded the information to Sgt Parr at the 58th Air Division Control Room, at which time a routine report was made and reported by TWX to all organizations concerned.

After collecting all information available at WPAFB Sgt Bluemel and Sgt Nickerson proceeded to Charleston W.Va., and stated that after checking all observation posts, in the Marietta, Ohio, area no unusual sightings were called in during 8 and 9 May 1958, also that he had not received a UFOB report in over two months.

At 1045, 13 May 1958, Sgt Bluemel and Sgt Nickerson reported to 1st Lt Miller, Adjutant of the 783rd AC&W Sq, Guthrie AFS, W.Va. They were then taken to Capt Schwarz, Chief Controller, and complete check of all tracks and radar scope reading were made for a period to four hours before and after the time given for the UFOB sighting. All sightings were identified by the Chief Controller and there were no indications of a UFOB in the reported area during 8 and 9 May 1958.


- page 33 -

At 12:45, 13 May 1958, Sgt Bluemel and Sgt Nickerson departed Guthrie AFS and proceeded to Marietta, Ohio. They arrived at Marietta, Ohio, at 1510, 13 May 1958, and reported to Sheriff Dean Ellis, Sheriff of Washington County, Ohio. A check was made and it was found out that the Source had given an erroneous address on the report. A further check was made with the Post Office and it was found out that the last address given by Source was at 602 7th St, Marietta, Ohio. After checking the above address it was found out that Source had moved to 705½ 2nd St. A check was made at the new address and no one was at home. After checking with neighbors it was found that the owner of the home was at work. The owner was contacted at his place of employment and confirmed the fact that the Source was living at his home as a roomer. The Source was then contacted at approximately 1845, 13 May 1958, and taken to the Twon Motel for an interview regarding UFOB he reported.

The Source was quite cooperative; however, immediately before the interview began, Source informed Sgt Bluemel and Sgt Nickerson that he knew his rights as an American Citizen and was not now or had never been a Communist or a Communist Party Member.

After having talked to the Sheriff, the postmaster and the last two landlords where Source had lived, and also after a complete interview with the Source it was then determined that the report Source had made was a complete fabrication or a figment of his imagination. He had no visable means of support, stating that he received money from income property from an uncle that had died. It was also impossible to find out where this property was because every time Source was asked this question he would give a different answer.

Source also stated that he had been a member of AFRO from 1955-57 and a member of NICAP from January 1957 until the present time.

The following is a probable definition of APRO and NICAP as given by Source

APRO: Aerial Phenomena Research Organization
NICAP: A UFOB Club established by Donald E. Keyhoe.


- page 34 -

Source stated that he had paid $10.00 to NICAP and all he ever got were a few booklets.

Source also stated that he was a high school graduate and had 2½ years of college at LACC, UCLA and USC; however, after having talked to the Source it was the opinion of the interviewers that the educational level of Source was not as he stated.
