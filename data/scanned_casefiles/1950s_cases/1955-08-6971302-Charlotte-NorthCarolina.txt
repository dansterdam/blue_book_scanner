10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) object, the size of a half dollar held at arm's length, appeared to be brighter than stars or normal aircraft. The colors of the object were yellow and white. The object took two or three seconds to travel from a position directly overhead to the eastern horizon.

11. COMMENTS
Due to the delay in receiving the initial report and its filing, the most other criteria of investigation, no investigation authorized. The duration of the sighting and the fact that the object crossed a major portion of the sky in a few seconds leads to the conclusion of POSSIBLY ASTRONOMICAL, METEORITE OR METEOR.
