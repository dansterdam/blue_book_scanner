Ambassador [redacted] visits Ontario cities

Ambassador [redacted] presently is on a tour of Southern Ontario which will take him to Windsor, Niagara Falls, Hamilton and Toronto. He addressed the Windsor Chamber of Commerce on April 17 and is scheduled to speak at a dinner meeting of the Toronto Board of Trade Club on April 21.

Comments: In his first official speech in Windsor since arriving in Canada in 1950, the Ambassador said that peace will soon come - not a phony peace - but a fundamental aim of U.S. foreign policy, not only because it makes sense but because it has historically made our country strong. He noted that the U.S. has steadfastly stood for developing their resources, to share them with others through world trade, and to develop within their own borders a social and economic system which has withstood the tests of both time and adversity.

In Toronto on April 21, Mr. Woodward will speak on the pattern of foreign policy emphasizing that U.S. policies and actions are all part of a "grand design" aimed at protecting world security.

Flying Saucers Excite Interest

A report of the sighting of another flying saucer has stirred up considerable interest in the press during the past week. Two senior non-commissioned officers of the RCAF stationed at North Bay, Ontario, about two hundred miles northwest of Ottawa, reported a "bright amber disc" in the sky which they observed for several minutes and which followed the usual pattern of changes in direction and intensity. The RCAF is continuing a routine investigation of their report but attaches no particular importance to it.

Comments: About 30 reports of sightings of mysterious objects have been reported during the past three years. In October 1950, after some investigation the RCAF accepted the conclusion of the USAF Project "Grudge" and adopted a routine procedure for the investigation of these incidents. The present flare-up of interest is notable in that senior-

TO:      Department of State

SUBJECT: JOINT WERK NO. 12 FROM SANA
          POLITICAL AND DEFENSE

          St. Lawrence Seaway and Power Project

          At a Washington meeting this week, President Truman
and Canada's External Affairs Minister Pearson decided
to proceed promptly to refer the question of power develop-
ment on the St. Lawrence River to the International Joint
Commission.

          Comment. This action does not of itself indicate
that the idea of joint development of the combined seaway
and power projects has been set aside since the way still
remains open for Canada to appear in the 1954 Treaty
as an inaction plan for joint development by the U.S. and
Canada.

          The Canadian Government, however, has been anxious to
initiate proceedings at least on the power project, irrespective
of eventual Congressional action, since such procedural
steps would serve to clarify the Canadian point of view. They
are satisfied the better from the Canadian point of view, the
power project, whether carried out by the Canadians or jointly,
requires reference to the International Joint Commission
since to obtain power it will be necessary to construct dams
which may affect the level of waters in the river and are
therefore a subject for consideration by the Commission.

          It's seaway would not necessarily require reference to
the IJC. If the Treaty is not approved by Congress, the seaway
could and would be constructed as a joint project in either
Canadian or American waters, or both, depending on decisions
reached by engineers studying the problem. In the other hand,
if the Treaty is not approved by Congress, the seaway could
be constructed on the Canadian side of the river, as in the
case of certain existing international, without reference
to the IJC unless it appeared that such construction would
have some effect on navigation or water levels on the
American side.

Flying Discs
No Joke Now
In Air Force

The Air Force, which once laughed off flying saucer reports as products of over-ripe imaginations, today ordered its Intelligence experts to study the cases of several discs reported over North Bay in the past four months.

Four airmen stationed at the North Bay base told their superiors they saw flying discs float silently over the local air station and an RCAF statement said there was no reason to doubt the statements.

All of the men were described as veterans with several years experience identifying conventional aircraft.

WO E. H. Rossell, a veteran airman with 13 years in the service, and Flt. Sgt. Reg McRae, a visitor from Weston, Ont., said they spotted a "bright amber disc" in the sky over the airfield around 6:30 p.m., Saturday.

The two said the disc came from the southwest, moved across the airfield, stopped and then took off in the reverse direction. It climbed at an angle of 30 degrees at "terrific speed" and disappeared.

WO W. J. Yeo, a master telecommunications superintendent, and Sgt. D. V. Crandell, an instrument technician, reported seeing a flying saucer the night of January 1.

"The saucer appeared to be at great height, probably outside the earth's atmosphere", they testified. "It appeared to be moving at supersonic speed."

Yeo and Crandell said they timed the object for eight minutes and 43 seconds and watched it move "roughly parallel to the earth". They said it changed direction slightly at times, "zig-zagging and climbing and diving without a sound".

The Air Force eagerly declined official comment about the flying saucers whose existence at one time was investigated thoroughly by the United States Air Force and declared questionable.

Can't Ignore Reports
Of Saucers: Mackenzie

Continued from Page One

If the disc seen over North
Bay had completely reversed its
direction as the airmen who saw
it said, it couldn't have been a
bright meteor or any other normal phenomenon, Dr. Millman
said.

"Whilst caution is advisable,
we must keep an open mind
about them."

The average meteor is visible
to the naked eye for only half
a second, Dr. Millman explained, and the brightest for no
more than three seconds. A
January 1 report of a flying
saucer over North Bay which
was observed by two other airmen for a period of more than
eight minutes obviously could
not be a meteor either.

Today, Atomic Energy Control Board Chairman Mackenzie, who had been among the
scientists who could not credit
the first reports of flying saucers, said:

"It seemed fantastic there
could be any such thing. At
first the temptation was to say
it was all nonsense, a series of
optical illusions. But there
have been so many reports from
responsible observers, such as
airplane pilots, that they cannot be ignored.

"It seems hardly possible that
all these reports could be due
to optical illusions."

What the flying saucers might
be or where they came from, suggested Dr. Mackenzie could not suggest.

On one point he was positive.

Many reports of flying saucers
have come from New Mexico
near the area where atomic experiments have been conducted.
United States observers have
wondered whether the saucers
were outcome of some
atomic experiments, but the
United States atomic control
authorities said this was not so.

Dr. Mackenzie said he could
give the same assurance for Canada. Nothing was being done

at Chalk River that would cause
flying saucers or anything else
to take the air.

Dr. Solandt said, "at the moment we are as mystified as
anyone else."

Reports of unusual occurrences in the sky were passed
on to the board from the services
and other sources and when
they appeared reasonably authentic were looked into carefully.

"There has been nothing yet
to make us feel final conclusions
are possible and it may be that,
as scientists we are harder to
convince. At times we have
felt the subject was closed and
then new reports from the
United States or elsewhere have
been published and it has been
reopened.

"We are keeping our minds
open and studying the information that becomes available."
Others here moved a significant parallel between the two
North Bay reports and the majority of those in the United
States.

Preponderance of substantial
reports of sky disc activity in the
U.S. has been in New Mexico
and Texas close to atomic
weapons proving grounds and experimental stations.

Similar to North Bay is a mere
115 miles from Chalk River, site
of Canada's big atomic energy
project.

The theory has been advanced
already that, assuming the sky
discs come from outside the
world, they may have been sent
by denizens of another planet to
check on nuclear fission developments on earth.

The theorists infer the space
men may be anxious over the
possibility that atomic activity
here may disturb the cosmos.

A German scientist now in the
United States who was chief designer at a wartime rocket establishment has kept records of
saucers seen all over the world.
His conclusion is that they came
from outside the world.

HUNT TOP CA

Can't Ignore Reports, Says Mackenzie
Solandt, Millman No Longer Complete Skeptics

By JAMES WARDROPE

(First few lines are partially illegible)

There was a change of attitude of three years ago regarding "flying saucers", mysterious "discs" and "fireballs" floating through North Americans skies were regarded as something close to a joke.

The RCAF and Canadian scientific leaders spoke amid a flurry of reports:

1. The sighting by airmen at the new RCAF North Bay jet base of "flying discs", which Air Intelligence fairly declared could not be simply shrugged off.

2. Documentation by the United States Army Air Forces of some 30 different "flying saucer", "disc" and "fireball" sightings.

The RCAF said its intelligence was investigating, as a non-scientific phenomenon, the case of the flying saucers.

Today, these were the "saucer" comments:

Dr. Peter Millman, Dominion Astrophysicist: "We can't ignore these observations."

Dr. C. J. Mackenzie, chairman of the Atomic Energy Control Board and recently the President of the National Research Council: "These reports cannot be ignored as nonsense"

Dr. O. M. Solandt, chairman of the Defence Research Board: "We are as mystified as anyone else... and are keeping an open mind."

Millman told The Journal: "We are good at laughing at these reports. We can't discover any conventional explanation which would cover the reported behavior of these objects."

RCAF Personnel
See Flying Discs
Near North Bay
North Bay, April 15 - In the
wake of renewed interest in the
flying saucer mystery, RCAF officials here today released two official statements from station personnel concerning the veil-o-discs.

The air force said that although
the statements did not constitute
an official RCAF view, there was
no reason to doubt their validity,
since the men concerned were veteran personnel, long familiar with
conventional aircraft.

Sgt. R. H. Russell, an aircraft
maintenance superintendent, and
Sgt. J. A. Cormier, said that on
Saturday about 8:50 p.m. they were
driving in a car from the married
quarters area of the North Bay Air
Station to the city.

Suddenly they spotted "a bright
amber disk" flying over the field.
They reported that the object appeared to hover midair, moved for
a brief period and then zoomed at
terrific speed from the direction
in which it had come, and at an
angle of 50 degrees.

WO. W. J. Yeo, a master telecommunications technician with 16
years' RCAF service, said that on
the same evening, with Sgt. D.
D. V. Crandall, an instrument technician, saw a reddish-colored object move over the field at supersonic speed. At a height they judged to
be outside the earth's atmosphere.
They watched the object constantly for a timed eight minutes
and 58 seconds, when it disappeared after making what they described roughly parallel to the earth.
The direction alternating, sometimes zigzagging and climbing
and diving. "There was no sound,"
he said.

"Frankly, I don't know what it
was, and for lack of better words,
I will call it a flying saucer," he
said.

The reports have been sent to
RCAF Intelligence.
