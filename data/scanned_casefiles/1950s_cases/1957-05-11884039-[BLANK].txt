ATIC 10. The attached proposed revision of AFR 200-2 is submitted for transmittal to
USAF Coordinator and USAF Regulation Committee for approval, inclusion and since
clearance with ARC laws have been incorporated, this Regulation is ready for
publication.
2. No substantive changes have been made to the most recent ATIC revision as stated in paragraph 3 of attachment 1. Other than deleting minor redundancy and ensuring clarity, the
changes indicated are considered to be of an administrative nature to facilitate distribution which is the point covered in this transmittal.
Of SAFPIS all unclassified Air Force regulations are made available to the Press. because
clearance of public interest in UFOs, the subject Regulation would receive close
scrutiny if any material that either in or out of context might reflect an unfavorable change in USAF attitude or policy toward UFOs. In every instance where the content has been removed or altered, at most, the effect of such deletions or
alterations would sacrifice informative material regulating the convenience of the
user of the Regulation.

The subject of U.S. persons having the UFO hysteria few personal gain where-interest in the subject of unidentified flying objects might be considered or public individual does not mean to personal UFOs should be made available to the FBI through the CIA. This subject is being studied by APFIN-4 and further developments will be brought to your attention.

SUBJ: Publication of UFO Special Report Nr. 14

TO: Director, AFOIN-H

1. The attached proposed revision of AFR 200-2 is submitted for final coordination. It USAF coordination has been accomplished and since changes originated with AFSC have been incorporated, the Regulation is considered ready for publication.

2. No substantive changes have been made to the most recent ATIC revision which would vitiate the purpose for accomplishing the revision - other than reducing the number of included Air Force names and clarifying certain security, the most recent changes attempt to provide authorization for any and all Regulations required by the public. As pointed out, because of public interest in UFOs, the subject should eventually be out of content might reflect an unfavorable change in Air Force Policy and therefore should be compiled with extreme caution.

3. The subject of U.S. persons using the UFO hysteria for personal gain has been thoroughly reviewed for this and other proposals. It is our considered opinion that to arouse public interest in UFOs would be inadvisable since this would likely be exploited by AFOIN-H and further development will be brought to your attention.

4. Concurrently with the publication of Report Nr. 14, as an Air Force Pamphlet, the publication of AFR 200-2, revised, should do much toward the relief of AFOIN in the UFO program.

1. The revised AFR 200-2, Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO), dated 5 February 1958 (attached) has been disseminated this date to all major air commands. Pending publication of this revision, the UFO project is being conducted under the provisions of AFR 200-2, dated 16 September 1955. It is reiterated that the UFO project will hereafter be conducted in an orderly manner, and that there will be no let-up by AFCIN-X1 in monitoring all Air Force UFO activities.

2. The following is a brief review of that which has been accomplished to date and disseminating responsibilities Air Force wide for the conduct of UFO investigation, analysis, and release of information:

a. The responsibility for investigating UFO sightings is no longer that of ADC, and the additional mission responsibilities levied on the USAF by AFCIN, emphasize responsibilities resulting from AFS IN, emphasize responsibilities for investigative coordination and release.

(1) An Air Force wide responsibility for UFO investigations with each AF base commander responsible for conducting initial investigations of UFO sightings in the locale of his base.

(2) ADC directly participating only when a UFO sighting is considered a hostile air vehicle; however, ADC will continue to render investigation as required.
(3) More extensive follow-up investigation, when considered necessary, to be accomplished by the 1006th AISS.
The above realignment of responsibilities should effect more economical utilization of the 1006th AISS and provide for more timely UFO reporting since local AF base Commanders can investigate on the spot.
G. The responsibility for release of UFO information to the public and Congress is assigned to SAFIS; however, ATIC may conduct follow-up investigations as necessary to further its findings.
Coordination on UFO matters between AFCIN and AFCIN-4 described in paragraph 4d above will be few such occurrences, as a result of ATIC's policy to SOI LLUFON relations.
As previously stated, AFCIN is now completely divorced from public relations on UFO matters. AFCIN will depend on SAFIS to handle and press relations.
In addition, the following significant developments are brought to your attention: 
1. The UFO Scientific Panel Report conclusions of 1953, sponsored by CIA, were declassified for public knowledge. It was necessary for CIA to contact each of the panel members to accomplish the declassification.

Here is the text output from the document:

C/S, Subj: New AFCIN-4 Plan on UFOs, Comment No. 4 (Cont)

a. SAFIS has reported that the press is completely satisfied with the periodic UFO "flap sheets" issued to them and the Air Force responses to specific UFO sightings.

The Investigation program, "UFO, Enigmas of the Skies," Circle Theater, 22 January 1958, has been beyond expectation. On 22 March a bulletin certifying the program were received by the Air Force. All were from so-called "cranks". Mr. Donald Keyhoe, President of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), aligned himself with the press by going beyond the T.V. script in an attempt to criticize the Air Force.

d. Several meetings between representatives of SAFRD, SAFIS, SAFLC, and SAFMO concerning public information as air force response to a request by the Senate's Government Operations Sub-Committee on Investigations to conduct open hearings on the Air Force conduct of its UFO program under AFCIN. The Sub-Committee requested the public be informed through the Congress-man who maintained that the public approach was favorably looked upon by all but the AFCIN member who manifested that the unstructured publicity could result in more difficulties than could be considered.

5. It is recommended that the foregoing be used as a basis for briefing of General Lewis.

6. Additional Comment: Reference paragraph 3d above, a memorandum is being prepared for General Kelly's signature requesting the issuance of a statement that preliminary findings of this committee regarding Air Force UFO activities do not warrant further investigation. Such a statement would be a valuable reference in all future congressional inquiries. Mr. Horner has consented to represent the Air Force in all future congressional inquiries regarding UFOs.

2. This has been a long, involved and difficult task. I would like to express appreciation to Major Pryme and Mr. Sanderson for their most effective efforts in getting this thing back in proper focus.
3. When the new regulation is published, it may be a good idea to wrap up briefing for Gen Lewis to advise him of our progress in realignment of roles and missions.
Further, until the new document takes hold, I suggest Major Byrne continue to watch the situation for APOIN. If and when it starts to go off the track again and misconcued communications arrive in APOIN, he, as the most knowledgeable officer, can take the immediate action to reorient proper adherence to our intra-air Force agreements.

COMMENTS: (for action, if necessary)

1. The attached proposed revision of AFR 200-2 is submitted for transmittal to
ATIC for final coordination.  The USAF certification has been accomplished and since a public consultation has AEC have been informed, the Regulation is ready for
publication.

2. No substantive changes have been made to the most recent ATIC revision
which would vitiate the support for co-accomplishing the revision as stated in paragraph 3 of Colonel Chappell's letter of 10 May 1957. The changes are essentially
editorial and clarifying in nature and serve merely to develop the organization and sequence of the Regulation which might provoke scrutiny or clarification. The changes arenecessitated by comments received from the field and are considered constructive because of public interest in UFOs, the subject regulation would receive close scrutiny and possible misunderstanding or policy regarding UFOs. Every effort was made to avoid any alteration which mightimpact adversely on the interest of the Regulation.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

The subject of U.S. persons using the UFO hysteria for personal gain has been brought to the attention of the FBI. Documented cases where persons have made money, acquired followers, etc., by taking advantage of this hysteria should be made available to the FBI through the OSI of the appropriate Air Force base to your attention.

Pamphlet, the publication of Report No. 12 as an Air Force release of Apport No. 14 as a confidential nature, should not be made available to the general public as such treatment will be detrimental to your attention.

1. - The time has arrived for X1 to take a good look at what DIN-4
is planning about these UFORS.

2. - The enclosed memorandum from AFOIN-4 represents their efforts 
to develop a distinct change of policy on this subject. This memo 
file also represents an attempt to align the new program with stated
policy of AFOIN and SAFPS.

3. Briefly, ATIC wants to accomplish the following (See AFR 200-2):
a. More clearly assign and define the responsibility for 
investigation to ADC.
b. More clearly assign and define the responsibility for 
analysis and evaluation to AFOIN-4. 
c. More clearly assign and define the responsibility for 
public information to SAFPS.
d. More clearly establish coordination between AFOIN and
AFODC (COLONEL J. C. NORBLOM) on this subject. (See HOI 11-37
