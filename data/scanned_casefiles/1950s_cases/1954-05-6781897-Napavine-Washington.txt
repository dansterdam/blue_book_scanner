SHE STATED IT WAS CONSIDERABLY CLOSER TO HER DUE TO ITS TREMENDOUS
SIZE. (SHE SAID THE SIZE OF THE FIRST UFOC TO BE 1/2 THE SIZE OF THE
DRIVE-IN MOVIE SCREEN. THE CHILDREN WHO OBSERVED THIS REPT UFOC WERE
EXTREMELY FRIGHTENED AND EXCITED BY THE SIGHTING. POSSIBILITY EXISTS
THAT THE FALLING LIGHTS WERE FLAMES ESCROW BY A COCARD NOTT BUT IS
LIGHT-EMITTING UFOC. WHILE THIS TYPE OF UFOC IS PRACTICALLY
CONDUCTED IN THIS AREA, LOCAL UFOG OTPS STATE THEY ARE NOT AWARE
