1. The attached 35 mm positive transparency has been reviewed and the following information is given:

a. Approximately in the center of the transparency are 7 light images arranged roughly in a circle. Two of the images are identified by their wings as birds in flight. The remaining 5 images are probably additional birds however in such attitude of flight that their wings cannot be seen.

b. Within this circle are 3 small "dot" like faults in the film emulsion caused probably by some mechanical means, i.e., scratching or other abrasions.
