Dear Sirs,

After reading in the press your latest progress report on the investigations of unidentified flying objects over a recent 13-months period, I am anxious to know what were your findings concerning the report I sent you. My report was sent to you with a letter dated December 15,1957 and it described an unusual aerial object which I saw over Baltimore on November 6,1957 at 9:43-9:47 P.M., E.S.T.

I would like to know at least into which of the six general categories you have placed my report. The details accounting for the object's most unusual appearance would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

Washington, D.C.

Dear sirs,

I received the enclosed letter in reply to my previous letter in which I requested information concerning the condition you have some to in regard to the UFO report I had sent you on December 15, 1957. Unfortunately due to some misunderstanding, December 15 was not the date of the incident which I saw over Baltimore appeared on the night of November 6, 1957 at 9:43-9:47 P.M.

Would you please search your records for the night of November 6th, 1957 and let me know into which of the six general categories my report has been placed. I would very much appreciate any details accounting for the object's most unusual appearance and whether or not your files indicate any other sightings in the Baltimore area on the night of November 6, 1957.

I am anxious to know what the unusual serial object I saw on Nov. 6 was, because in the hundreds of hours I have spent in observing the night sky as an amateur astronomer I have never seen the likes of it. In closing, I wish to thank you for your trouble and consideration.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
