11. Captain John K. Hrdina, Chief, Operational Intelligence.

This is the first report of this nature since 1954. Some observers were immediately of the opinion that the object was a weather balloon. A check of the weather station in the vicinity of Osan indicated that no weather balloons were released in the area at such a time as to have been visible at the time of the incident. On 3 October 1957, the reporting officer observed the same phenomenon at 2000T. An investigation of this incident revealed:

a. The light came from a battery-operated lamp attached to a weather balloon.

b. Weather balloons are scheduled for release at 2000T but there is considerable local deviation from the schedule.

Previous reports on similar incidents have been prepared by 8th District OSI.
Report numbers and dates:

a. EEI - 49-55-10B-2-1, 25 June 1954.
b. EEI - 49-55-10B-2-2, 25 June 1954.
