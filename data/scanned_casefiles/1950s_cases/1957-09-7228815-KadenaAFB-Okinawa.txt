UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
At 2000 hours, 29 Sept 1957, during darkness, Lt O'Connor's attention was caught by two bright lights in the sky, about 5-10 degrees above the horizon, traveling on a generally NE to SW course. The lights appeared to be at an elevation angle of about 25-30 degrees, and were traveling at a speed which Lt O'Connor estimated to be approximately 600 mph. As the lights approached, he noticed that there were actually two objects, side by side, and that they appeared to be connected by some sort of a "bar" or "bridge" between the two. The objects stopped, hovered momentarily, and then separated, with one continuing on the original course, and the other turning and heading in a northerly direction. Both men were just looking around when O'Connor's attention was caught by the lights. The objects appeared unidentified - like a couple of bottle-shaped lights without a top. They seemed to be about 25-30 feet in diameter, and between 50-100 feet apart. The objects were observed for about 2-3 minutes before they disappeared from sight. Lt O'Connor also saw the object just before it disappeared.

The object paused directly overhead and then continued in a straight direction overhead.
SPEED: Extremely fast, comparable to a jet interceptor.

SUMMARY (Cont'd)
b. The object was sighted for only a very short duration--1-2 seconds--and it is impression of the observer that it was round. The object appeared to be quite small but a definite round, disc-like object.

c. The object maintained a fixed relative position and altitude without any appreciable visible motion.

g. The object appeared to vibrate--it also was likened unto a jellyfish, as one observer remarked, and contained no other distinguishing characteristics.

h. Sightings at regular 3 minute intervals except the last when only two sightings had elapsed.

2. Description of courses:
a. Observers were by chance looking skyward at the time. Object was estimated to be at an elevation angle of about 45 degrees and an azimuth of 235 degrees. The object was apparent for about 1 to 1 1/2 seconds, then disappeared and reappeared with a slightly different azimuth and elevation angle, but again the pass was basically north to south direction.
b. On the second observation the object was seen for about 1 second from an azimuth of 200 degrees and an elevation of about 40 degrees. The third sighting came from an azimuth of 210 degrees and an elevation of about 35 degrees. The fourth sighting was from an azimuth of 200 degrees and an elevation of about 30 degrees.
