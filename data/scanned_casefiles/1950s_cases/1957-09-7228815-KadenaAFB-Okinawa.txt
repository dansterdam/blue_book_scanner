SUBJECT
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

At 2000 hours, Friday, 20 Sep 57, S/Sgts Hugh T. O'Connor and Hillis D. Bridgman of the 13th Continental Communications Squadron, were on the veranda between the two wings of barracks #110.

Both men were just looking around when Sgt O'Connor's attention was caught by an "oval-shaped obj" with a "glow-like fluorescent light". The object seemed "indented-like a coke bottle without a top". In size, the object was slightly bigger than a grapefruit held at arm's length. The object seemed to vibrate. It was also lighted into a jellyfish as it gave the impression of "translucence." Sgt Bridgeman also saw the object just before it disappeared.

When first sighted, the object was at an elevation angle of 45° and azimuth of 350½. The object was lost from sight on an azimuth of 200° where it entered the cloud cover.


- page 2 -

Here is the text from the document:

The object made four passes, remaining visible approximately 5 to 10 seconds during each pass. There was a five minute interval between each pass except for the fourth which allowed an interval of only four minutes.

All four passes were made in a generally North-South direction. On the first sighting, the object traveled level in a distant arc. On the second and third observations the flight path was level but the course was straight rather than in an arc. On the/spent final pass the object passed directly overhead and seemed to gain altitude before disappearing into the cloud cover.

Throughout the sighting the object did not change size and the speed remained constant. No sound was heard throughout the sightings.

Supplementary Report: On the evening of 20 Sep 57, at approximately 2010I, S/Sgt [name obscured] in the company of S/Sgts [names obscured] was on the veranda of barracks 110 in the company of S/Sgts [name obscured] before.

His attention was called to an object seen by the [text obscured] Sgts a few moments before.

SUMMARY (Cont'd)

His impression of the object after a very short sighting--1-2 seconds--was that it was round, very much like a shooting star in color and action, and that it traveled at extreme speed with no sound.

So first sighted the object on an azimuth of 300° and an elevation angle of 45°. It was lost from sight when it passed beyond the barracks wall at an azimuth of approximately 200°.

1. Description of object:
a. The object was roughly oval-shaped, with indented sides, giving it a coke bottle, minus the neck, appearance.
b. The observers agreed the size of the object was about that of a grapefruit held at arm's length.
c. The object was bright white in color; very distinct, like a bright fluorescent lightbulb.
d. Once.
e. N/A.
f. The object seemed to vibrate. It also was likened unto a jellyfish, as one observer stated it gave the impression of translucence.
g. None.
h. None.
i. Sightings at regular 5 minute intervals except the last when only four minutes had elapsed.

2. Description of course:
a. Observers were by chance looking skyward at the time.
b. Object was first sighted at an elevation angle of 45° and azimuth of 300° when first sighted by first observer. The object was on a 45° elevation angle and azimuth of 25°.
c. The object was lost from sight by both observers at the same elevation angle (45°) with an azimuth of 100°. Third observation no azimuth was definite but again the pass was basically North to South on an elevation angle of 45°. The fourth and final sighting found the object at an elevation angle of 60° and passing directly overhead.
d. The object this time was sighted on an azimuth of 350° and seemed to be climbing.
e. The object was lost from sight on an azimuth of 200° on the first and fourth sightings. On the second observation it was lost in the overcast at an azimuth of 95°. Seventh and final observation was constant at 45° except for the final overhead pass when the object was at 60°.

90°-60° elevation angles, disappearing at the latter angle on a 200° azimuth.

d. On the first sighting the object flew level in a distinct area. On the second and third observations the flight path was still level but the course was straight rather than in an arc. The object seemed to gain altitude on the fourth and final pass. No speed was determined for any of the sightings.

e. Object disappeared each time into the overcast.

3. Manner of observation:
a. Ground visual.
b. Naked eyes.
c. M/A

4. Time and date of sightings:
a. 201052, 201102, 201152, and 201192, September 1957.
b. Night.

5. Location of observers:
a. Observers were standing on a veranda between the two wings of barracks 110, Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. Geographical coordinates of Kadena Air Base, 26°21'N/127°47'E. Observers were located approximately 1200 yards 165° azimuth from the Base Operations Tower.

6. Identification of observers:
a. S/Sgt 13th Communications Sq, Communications Soc.
b. S/Sgt Kadena Air Base, APO 239.
c. S/Sgt Kadena Air Base, APO 229.
