Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is in reference to your recent letter in which you reported sighting an unidentified flying object in England in 1951.

Since it would be necessary to have the exact time of sighting as well as the exact location in the sky and an accurate weather forecast for that particular time, it is believed that it would not be possible to give you an evaluation of the object you saw.

We are inclosing a summary of information on Project Blue Book, the program for the investigation and evaluation of unidentified flying object reports. This will explain in detail the necessary facts to a complete evaluation of any UFO report.

Thank you for advising us of this unusual phenomena. We regret that we are unable to give you a more detailed answer.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

Dear Captain Quintanilla:

I saw in the paper recently how you take UFO seriously. I have had a little secret for about 13 years, but always feared being labelled a crackpot, but at this stage I could care less.

Perhaps you need this information in mapping the position on the cold globe that sightings are made, the types, and dates.

Our home in England was about 500 yards from the River Thames, half way between the towns of Kingston and Richmond, in Surrey, England. I was home on a 3 day pass from the army in June 1951. I was alone, and standing by the river side, when I happened to glance up and was startled

Here is the text from the document:

object. It stayed in one position
above the river for what seemed a
long time, to me, though it may
have been only for a minute. I longed
for binoculars a camera or even a
witness but I was too far to be
seen or heard. I had heard of flying
saucers with portholes around the side,
but this was just a little bright object.

Size of an average probable,
circumference, diameter, etc.
The stated time a bore are a

as only the bottom side
it was say a plate, or saucer
slightly low to me. After an estimate
I moved a couple of steps (I was going to
turn for aid) then in a twinkling it
was gone. No, it was not a weather
balloon! Its brightness was from within,
well, more a ball, your truly

There are also some small hand-drawn sketches in the margins, but I have not transcribed those as instructed.

P.S. I almost forgot:

While watching the object, thousands of things flashed through my mind, but at one point I said to myself, "they'll smile of bright zinc."

Zinc to me had always seemed to be a harsh or dull metal, not at all bright, yet here it was as if the zinc was extremely hot, and therefore so bright. Also, in spite of this brightness, the object was very clear, as clear and clean cut as the bright full moon on a clear night.
