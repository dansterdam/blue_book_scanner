According to their account, at approximately 8:30 PM, they observed a bright, glowing, oval-shaped object moving slowly across the sky. The object appeared to be approximately 25-30 feet in diameter and was surrounded by a halo of light. The object was observed for several minutes before it accelerated and disappeared from view.
