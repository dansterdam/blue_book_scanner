10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) round, brilliant white object, larger than any star in the sky, appeared for approximately 20 seconds and then faded out. Object appeared to move in a southerly direction at an unknown speed. No sound.

11. COMMENTS
Although no sound was heard in connection with the sighting, the brevity or the sighting coupled with the brilliant white color and the fade out indicates the possibility of an after-burner equipped aircraft F-94, F-86, etc. No investigation authorized.
