NETHER THE GROUND CONTROL NOR THE RADAR CREW WERE ABLE TO PAINT THE UFO ON THEIR RADAR SCOPES HOWEVER AI RADAR WAS POINTED TOWARD THE GROUND DURING THE PERIOD OF THE SIGHTING. APPARENT SPEED OF THE UFO AND THE LACK OF RADAR RETURN IN A CLEAR AREA INDICATE EITHER A VERY LARGE OBJECT GOING VERY FAST BEYOND RANGE OF RADAR OR A VERY SMALL OBJECT AT CLOSE RANGE. NO FURTHER INFORMAIIM IS AVAILABLE. 10TH AIR DIV EVALUATION: SHORT DURATION OF SIGHTING, COLOR OF BURNING TAIL, INABILITY TO SEE OBJECT AFTER COMPLETING 180 TURN WHICH TOOK ONLY 1 TO 15 SECONDS TO COMPLETE, INABILITY OF GCI STATION TC PAINT, THE SUDDEN AND DRASTIC SHORTENING OF TAIP DURING THE 5 SECONDS UFO WAS UNDER OBSERVATION ALL STRONGLY SUGGEST THE UFO WAS A METER.
