THE GROUND CONTROLLER NOR THE RADAR OBSERVER WERE ABLE TO PAINT THE UFO
ON THEIR RADAR SCOPES HOWEVER AI RADAR WAS POINTED TOWARD THE GROUND
DURING THE PERIOD OF THE SIGHTING APPARENT SPEED OF THE UFO AND THE
LACK OF RADAR RETURN IN A CLEAR AREA INDICATE EITHER A VERY LARGE OBJECT
GOING VERY FAST BEYOND RANGE OF RADAR OR A VERY SMALL OBJECT AT CLOSE
RANGE. NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. 14TH AIR DIV
EVALUATION: SHORT DURATION OF SIGHTING, COLOR OF BURNING TAIL, INABILITY
TO SEE OBJECT AFTER COMPLETING 180 TURN WHICH TOOK ONLY 12 TO 15
SECONDS TO COMPLETE, INABILITY OF GCI STATION TO PAINT, THE SUDDEN AND
DRASTIC SHORTENING OF UFOB DURING MID-5 SECONDS UFOB WAS UNDER
OBSERVATION ALL STRONGLY SUGGEST THE UFOB WAS A METEOR. PILOT INDICATED

PAGE THREE RIJKDAD 32
THAT HE IS FAMILIAR WITH APPEARANCE OF METEORS FROM THE GROUND AND FELT
THE UFOB RESEMBLED AN AIRCRAFT MORE THAN A METEOR. HOWEVER, HE HAD
NEVER SEEN A METEOR AT 25000 FT WHICH SEEMED CLOSE TO HIS AIRCRAFT.
CHECK WITH MILITARY STATIONS ALONG EXTENDED FLIGHT PATH FOR UFOB OR
METEOR REPORT DREW NEGATIVE RESPONSE. CHECK WITH UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA
INDICATED THAT METEOR SHOWER WAS NOT EXPECTED DURING PERIOD OF SIGHTING.
