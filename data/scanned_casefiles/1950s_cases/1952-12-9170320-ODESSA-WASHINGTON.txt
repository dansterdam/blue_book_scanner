Odessa, Washington
10 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
Two pilots in an F-94 made visual and radar contact with a large, round white object larger than any known type of aircraft. A dim reddish-white light came from the object as it hovered. A dim reddish-white light came from the object as it hovered. It reversed direction almost instantaneously and the object disappeared at about 3,000 feet. The radar and visual contact were simultaneous and lasted for 15 minutes. An attempted to contact local civil air authorities was unsuccessful.

II. Discussion of Incident
Two additional F-94s were in the general area but at lower altitudes and thus are eliminated as possible cause for the sighting. The description of the object and its performance indicates upper air research balloons are tear-shaped and made of translucent polyethylene and are cruising at high altitudes up to 80,000 feet. The equipment hanging below as 50 feet in length. The equipment hanging below as 50 feet in length. The equipment hanging below as 50 feet in length. There is no record of upper air research balloon tracks for this date, the description of the object follows a preliminary evaluation of "possible balloons".

III. Conclusion
Possible balloon.

Sirius has inspired many UFO reports. On December 10, 1952 at 7:35 P.M. PST, civilian pilot and radar observer of an F-51 on routine patrol duty were over the town of Odessa, Washington, at about 6,000 feet when they saw a large white light in the east [1]. Dim reddish-white lights seemed to be coming from "windows," and no trail or exhaust was visible. The pilot attempted to intercept but the object performed amazing feats--did a chandelle in front of the plane, made a steep climb, ramped away, stopped, and then made a straight for the ground at a terrific speed. The pilot climbed to avoid collision, and afterward was not able to locate the object. The radar man then got a brief return but soon lost contact. Although the visual and radar contacts had not coincided, both men assumed that they referred to the same object [S, p. 38]. Investigators suggested at first that the object might have been one of the Tektonic balloons, but this idea had to be discarded and the sighting was listed as Unknown. A review of the evidence by the present authors suggests a highly probable explanation. Above the low cloud cover at 3,000 feet the night was clear and moonless. In the east, Sirius was just rising over the horizon at the azimuth of the sighting. The unknown "object" was just the star Sirius. The atmospheric refraction would have produced exactly the phenomenon described. The same atmospheric conditions that caused the mirage of the star would have caused anomalous radar returns (see Chapter VIII).
