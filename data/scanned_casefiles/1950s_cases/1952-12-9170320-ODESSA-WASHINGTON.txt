Odessa, Washington                                                10 December 1952

I.   Description of Incident

Two pilots in an F-94 made visual and radar contact with a large, round white object larger than any known type of aircraft. A dim reddish-white light came from the object as it hovered, reversed direction almost instantaneously and then disappeared. The object appeared to be level with the intercepting F-94 at 26,000 to 27,000 feet. Airborne radar and visual contact were simultaneous and lasted for 15 minutes. F-94 attempted to contact local GCA but without success. Weather was clear above 3,000 feet. Time of sighting was 1215 PST.

II.  Discussion of Incident

Two additional F-94 were in the general area but at lower altitudes and thus are eliminated as possible cause for the sighting. The description of "large, round and white and extremely large" is significant. Upper air research balloons are tear-shaped and made of translucent polyethylene and at cruising altitude expand to as much as 50 feet in length. The equipment hanging below the balloon is capable of making a return to airborne radar. Although ATIC has received no record of upper air research balloon tracks for this date the description of the object allows a preliminary evaluation of "possible balloon".

III. Conclusion

Possible balloon.

On the night of Dec. 10, 1952, near another atomic installation, the pilot and radar observer of a patrolling F-94 spotted a light while flying at 26,000 feet. They checked and were told that no planes were known to be in the area. They closed on the object and saw a large, round white "thing" with a reddish light coming from two windows. They made visual contact, but got a radar lock. They reported that when they attempted to close on it again, it would reverse direction and drop away. Several times the plane altered course to follow, but could never maintain visual contact. There was a solid undercast of clouds, which would eliminate the possibility of refraction of ground lights.

In each of these instances, as well as in the case narrated next, the sources of the stories were trained airmen with excellent reputations. They were sincerely baffled by what they had seen. They had no conceivable motive for falsifying or "dressing up" their reports.

In the other instance, with the "white object with two windows," we found that a skyhook balloon had been plotted at the exact site of the "battle".

Sirius has inspired many UFO reports. On December 10, at 7:15 P.M. P.S.T., the pilot and radar observer of an F-94 on routine patrol duty were over the town of Odessa, Washington, at about 28,000 feet when they saw a large white light in the east [sic].

Dim reddish-white lights seemed to be coming from "windows," and no trail or exhaust was visible. The pilot attempted to intercept but the object performed amazing feats—did a candle in front of the plane, rushed away, stopped, and then made straight for the aircraft on a collision course at incredible speed. The pilot banked away to avoid collision, and afterward was not able to locate the object. The radar man then got a brief return but soon lost contact.

Although the visual and radar contacts had not coincided, both men assumed that they referred to the same object [p. 66].

Investigators suggested at first that the object might have been one of the Telemk balloons, but this idea had to be discarded and the sighting was listed as Unknown. A review of the evidence by the present authors suggests a highly probable explanation.

Above the low cloud cover at 3000 feet the night was clear and moonless. In the east, Sirius was just rising over the horizon at the exact bearing of the Unknown object. Atmospheric refraction would have produced exactly the phenomenon described. The same atmospheric conditions that caused the mirage of the star would have caused anomalous radar returns (see Chapter VIII).
