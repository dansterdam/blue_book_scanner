The observation was made by John Kuchner, the principal of the Cut Bank, Montana grade school. This event occurred shortly after dark on August 7, 1952. The only means of seeing the object was its light. This light was very bright, and would "flashes" on and off rapidly. The flashes were steady and regular, with a frequency of 2 to 3 flashes per second. The object was high in the sky, at an estimated altitude of 12,000 to 15,000 feet. It appeared to be oval in shape. Although the light was calm and steady, the object seemed to be rotating or revolving. I would estimate that the diameter of the object was about 30 feet. It moved swiftly and silently in an easterly direction. After being observed for about 2 minutes, the object suddenly increased its speed and disappeared. I made an official report of this event through official channels and during the next few days many local people reported seeing the same or a similar object.
