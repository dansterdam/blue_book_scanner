30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size, if necessary.

This observation was made somewhat adverse conditions, by that I mean it was dark with out a moon.

The only means of seeing the object was by its flickering light. This light was given off and on with a regularity of a commercial electric position light, which at first I believed it was. To terrific to rule out that possibility.

There was no sound although the night was calm and background noise was at a minimum.

When I had plotted the course of the object I turned the observation of it over to my brother while I phoned in my report. While he was observing object changed course to S.E. and stopped. It then took off and disappeared very rapidly.

Total time object was seen was between 2-3 minutes.
