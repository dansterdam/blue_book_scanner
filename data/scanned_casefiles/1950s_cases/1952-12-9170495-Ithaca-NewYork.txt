On the 17th of December, 1952 at 0757 hours at the campus of Cornell University, Ithaca, New York the following aerial phenomena was observed: a light resembling a jet exhaust, greenish-blue with an orange-red trail was moving in a westerly direction at a very high speed. It appeared to traverse 30 degrees of arc in approximately two seconds. High cirrus clouds estimated at more that 20,000 feet altitude were present. The light disappeared from view behind the leading edge of the cloud. No aircraft structure was visible. The light appeared to be elongated and traveling in a horizontal plane.

Considering the altitude and arc traversed, the observers estimated the speed to be in excess of 700 miles per hour. The local civil defense authority was notified.
