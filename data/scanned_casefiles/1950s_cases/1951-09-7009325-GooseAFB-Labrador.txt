AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects - Goose Air Force Base, Labrador, Canada
DATE: 7 September 1951

This report covers the sighting of an unidentified flying object observed at Goose Air Force Base, Labrador, Canada, on 31 August 1951 at approximately 0230 hours.

At approximately 0230 hours, the duty NCO officer on the east end of the runway observed three bright lights which appeared to be moving rapidly at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet.

The duty NCO called the control tower and reported the sighting. The control tower also observed the lights and confirmed the report. The lights were observed for approximately two minutes and then disappeared from sight. No further sightings were made during the remainder of the night.

The report also states that the lights were observed to be above the normal flight pattern of any known aircraft utilizing the Goose Air Force Base at that time.

From the information provided, the following conclusions can be drawn:
(1) Unidentified flying objects were observed
(2) The objects moved at a high rate of speed

The report indicates that this incident was observed and reported by more than one witness.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

7 SEPTEMBER 1951

CLASSIFIED: RESTRICTED

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT

(1) DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: At approximately 2345 hours, 7 SEPTEMBER 1951, an unidentified aerial object was observed by four (4) enlisted personnel stationed at Goose AFB, Labrador.

(2) LOCATION: Goose AFB, Labrador, Canada.

(3) DETAILS: The object was first observed to the south at an elevation of approximately 30 degrees. It remained stationary for approximately five (5) minutes, then began moving in a northerly direction at a tremendous rate of speed. The object appeared to be round in shape, luminous in nature, and approximately twice the size of a B-29 aircraft at the same distance. The object was observed by four (4) enlisted men for a total of approximately ten (10) minutes.

(4) CONCLUSION: Based on the description of the object and the highly credible observers, it is the opinion of the undersigned that this incident cannot be readily explained as a known type of aircraft, celestial body, or atmospheric phenomena. Further investigation is considered warranted.
