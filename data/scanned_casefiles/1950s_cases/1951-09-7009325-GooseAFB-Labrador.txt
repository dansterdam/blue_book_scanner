10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Target A appeared on scope, approx 3 mins later Target B appeared, after Targets A & B disappeared Target C appeared. Target A was a strong and steady target similar to that of a/c at approx 4,000 ft alt. Its speed was est by GCA operators to be 150 mph. Targets B & C were weak intermittent targets similar to a/c flying above 5,000 ft alt. No speed est for B & C but both at approx same speed.

11. COMMENTS
Even if Radar scope was in warm up stage Targets (blips) would notice followed such a definite course. Therefore case is UNIDENTIFIED.

☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical

Unidentified Aerial Object near Goose Bay, Labrador    Intelligence Division, HQ MATS
Directorate of Intelligence    Washington 25, D.C.

22 October 1951    12 September 1951    1st Ind Tech

1. Report contains information concerning three unidentified "blips" which were observed on the plan position indicator (PPI) under scope of the Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) with at Goose Bay, Labrador, on 12 September 1951. Observations were made by two MATS radar survey technicians who stated that the "blips" appeared to have a small speed and changed position in one instance one of the targets slowed as instructed from the tower. The clearance roll out was not completed in the transmission of the report.

Attached to Inclosure 1 is a photograph of a layout plan of the Goose Bay area on which data relating to the observation is plotted. Attached as Inclosure 2 is the weather report for Goose Bay during the period of observation of the radar.

At 0203, 14 September 1951, a radar return appeared on the radar scope approximately six miles east of Goose Bay and about 1,000 feet in a westerly direction. Sighting a light turn of about a light haze of about 1/2 to 3/4 miles in diameter, the radar operator saw a light point in the center.

Approximately three minutes after the PAA appeared on his scope, another radar return was noted at 7,500 feet and proceeded on a course of approximately 280 true heading.

Both targets were not seen in the photograph, and the control tower personnel could not visually sight the objects.

The control tower log substantiates the following:

(1) No visual sighting.
(2) There was no other notice to indicate the presence of aircraft.

Approximately 0215 during the most southeast of Goose F, the radar operator noted a haze of about 1/2 to 3/4 miles in diameter.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Intelligence Division, Hq USAF
Arlington AT Plaza, Washington, D.C.                        FI-212-52        PAGE    3    OF    3    PAGES

(1) Estimated by the GCA operators to be 150 NM. However, from the
    plotted points and three given (even mile) in three minutes, it
    was estimated at 120 NM.

(2) Targets "B" and "C" were weak intermittent targets similar to
    aircraft lying above 5,000 feet altitude. No specific more
    definite information can be given. The aircraft appeared to
    be travelling at about the same speed according to the operator.

2. In the opinion of the GCA operator who was on duty when the above mentioned
events occurred, the target was in good working condition and can definitely be
warned up. Therefore, malfunction of equipment is not considered as a cause.
For this target, appearing on the scope, the other aircraft with the position
on the scopes were the same as the case received on any aircraft and that the targets
followed a course and made turns.
