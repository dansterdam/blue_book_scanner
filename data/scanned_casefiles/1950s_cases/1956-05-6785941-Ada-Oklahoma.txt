[Letterhead]
July 16th, 1956

Dear Sirs:

I have a matter which I am sure is worthy of bringing to your attention. However, because of the possibility of subversive activity, I am reporting it to you.

On May 17th, 1956, a friend and I sighted approximately 20 flying objects which we believe were planes. There was a short article about these objects in the local paper. On or about July 2nd, 1956, I received a letter from a civilian agency-Civilian Flying Saucer Intelligence (handwritten copy enclosed)-and a blank form to be filled out. I filled the form out and returned it.

I thought about having sent the form back for several days. Then I decided that if a civilian organization would want this information, I should also send it to the Air Force.

I don't have a form to fill out but I have described the circumstances and a diagram of the way the objects appeared in the sky and I have enclosed it for your information.

I hope that this information may be of use to you.

Sincerely,
[Signature blacked out]

[Handwritten notes on bottom and side of document]
