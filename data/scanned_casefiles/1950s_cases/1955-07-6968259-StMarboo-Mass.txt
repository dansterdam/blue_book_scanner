10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
One found object, with jagged outer edges, which appeared red, orange, yellow, and blue, appeared as a bright light. Pilot from location could not account for the color and size.
11. COMMENTS:
At time of sighting Saturn was at an altitude of 39Â° and in the SW, the time of sighting. Possibly the sighting of this object could have been Saturn and though he appeared to pass thru the object, his binoculars used by observers could have accounted for the color and size.
