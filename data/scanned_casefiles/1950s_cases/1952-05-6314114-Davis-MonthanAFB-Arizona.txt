Upon questioning, the pilots denied that the object interfered 
with either the flying characteristics of the B-36 or the naviga- 
tion or radio equipment. 
   
Upon disappearance from the aircraft the UFO lost altitude, crossed 
under the aircraft, joined the other object and the two separated 
at extremely high speed in a southerly direction. (Aircraft alt1- 
tude, airspeed, heading, UFO headings,approximate speeds and 
exact size estimates are in the original report, but I can not reoom- 
ber them.) During the close proximity of the object the pilots 
did not try evasive action. 

The aircraft and crew were from Carswell AFB, Texas and were on a 
flight to March AFB, California . It is possible that this report 
is filed in Blue Book Archives under either of those base names. 

I hope this report and the diagrams are of some help, Jim.

1. On 1 May 1952, 1010 Locut officers 
em Northwest observed two unidentified flying objects at an altitude estimated at 30,000 feet of attitude observed over Sfe,

2. At this time of observation 
standing at 32° 10' 52" N and 110° 58' 30" W in Irva H Glanders base hospital observing the flight of a B-36 on a general in heading.

3. The weather report from the base monitor station for 0478 hours on 1, May 1952, vas as follows: Weather-clear, visibility 50 miles, temp-72° f, dew point 58° f, winds-calm, sea level pressure- 
141 inches, altimeter-30.06 inches, station pressure 27,30 inches.

4. l– states that two object, approximately round in shape, silver metal in color, with no protruding surfaces, in a line formation, above the altitude of the B-36, over about 3 to about 5 to 4 times the speed of the B-36 aircraft. (Sec Diagram for Approach)

5. These objects, then overtook the B-36 doing Immediately close to the speed of this aircraft which was estimated 300 miles her hour.

6. After staying in formation with the bomber air 4- toush (30) seconds, object B (sec diagram), executed a sharp, no radio, 70-80 degree turn from the line of flight of the B-36 and proceeded about ⅔ of the distance to the horizon at approximately the speed at which the two objects over took the aircraft.

7. Object Bs (see diagram) then executed an immediate stop and hovered for about 380 seconds where it seemed to distance in explain.

8. The object then started to decrease in size, as if gaining altitude without forward motion, until it disappeared.

9. When S/Sgt (blackened) returned his gaze to the B-36 aircraft, object “A” had disappeared in a manner unknown to him.

10. The diameter of each object was about the size of the length of the horizontal stabilizer of the B-36 aircraft.

11. There was no noise other than the normal sound of the B-36 engines and no con-trail or exhaust trail from either object or the B-36 was seen.

INSTITUTE OF ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.  
Project Bluebook  
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio  

Dear Major Quintanilla: 

Following our second unsuccessful effort to locate in the Bluebook files any record of the B-36 incident at Davis-Monthan AFB, I have asked [redacted] put down, in a letter to me, an account of such details as he can still remember with confidence. I enclose, for your insertion into the Bluebook files, a copy of Maj. Pestalozzi’s letter of July 7, 1966.

Please file with it my present letter of transmittal, since I shall put down a few additional pertinent points.

[Redacted] has told me, in previous conversations, that he was an air intelligence officer from about 1950 to 1960, and was stationed at Davis-Monthan during 1951-53. Field investigation of UFO sightings was one of his routine duties, not only at Davis-Monthan but also at other duty stations. The B-36 case, which he believes occurred in 1952, was one in which he himself happened to be an observer. Although he has now made a number of efforts to run down clues to the precise date, the latter still remains uncertain, as I indicated to you in my last visit at WPAFB on June 30.

He recalls filing a rather thick report on this B-36 case, the thickest he ever filed on a UFO. It included not only his own observations and those of the B-36 crew which he personally interrogated, but also that of an airman who was standing beside him during most of the time of his own observation. The airman (whose name he has forgotten) was coming out of the base hospital just as [redacted] was about to enter (for treatment of an injured knee). [Redacted] pointed out to me today that approximately six or seven other Air Force personnel at scattered locations around the base also reported seeing the UFO’s from the ground. Because their descriptions matched closely those given by himself and the airman, [redacted] did not (at least as far as he now recalls) include them in his official report.

I have queried [redacted] closely about the length of time during which he had the UFO's under observation. He estimates it at something like five minutes. He actually saw the two

UFO's overtake the westbound B-36, and he held them under observation as the aircraft passed overhead until the objects departed. His recollection, as of today, was that his line of sight to the B-36 at the time the UFO's moved into position was at an angle of elevation of about 50 degrees (estimated uncertainty about 5-10 degrees); and the UFO's departed when the line of sight to the aircraft was about the same angle above the western horizon. The aircraft was almost due east of the base when the objects joined it, and it lay due west when they departed. Its heading was almost due west during the entire period of observation. (In an earlier conversation, estimated the total time of observation at perhaps 3 minutes. The latter time would be a bit more compatible with an estimated flight altitude of 20,000 ft and the estimated angles of line of sight. But every one of these estimates is based on recollections of an event 14 years old, so perhaps all that is now warranted is the conclusion that the UFO's paced the B-36 for "several minutes." The latter time is compatible with the fact that all of the crew, save the pilot, were able to get back to the starboard blister to see the UFO before it left.)

As he sketched the relative positions, recalled an important detail. The UFO near the aircraft was at a level distinctly lower than the mid-section of the fuselage (see sketch). He recalled that the crew described looking somewhat down upon it, and the blister itself is below mid-section. This may explain why there was no marked aerodynamic disturbance of the aircraft's flight characteristics, one of the very puzzling features of the incident.

’s enclosed account does not directly state it, but he has mentioned to me that the B-36 crew was a bit shaken by this experience. He pointed out to me that, after the UFO's departed, the B-36 radioed Davis-Monthan control tower and demanded permission to land immediately. It was just after they landed that Operations called him over to interrogate the crew.

has related to me a number of other UFO cases which he investigated in the early 1950's in the Southwest. I regret that our search of the Bluebook files during my June 7-8 visit did not turn up the one at Sequoia National Park where the ranger and his wife were driving in a jeep when overtaken by a disc-shaped UFO. said the rush of air bent treetops, blew the ranger's hat off, and left the ranger with the impression that it had even rocked the jeep. This would be a good case study. If you ever run across it, I'd like to know of

it. Unfortunately, here as in the case of the B-36, dates are
uncertain, though he'd put it at 1952 or 1953. Other very
interesting UFO incidents in the Tucson area in the same period
have been described by but in my two visits
to your office, I've had no luck in locating them, so I
suppose they're not going to show up now.

If you should ever come upon anything bearing on the B-36
case, please let me know. It seems to me to be an extremely
important UFO incident.

Sincerely,

Tucson, Arizona 7 July 1966

Dear Jim,

The information you requested several weeks ago concerning a UFO report submitted by me as reporting officer to HBAT Project Blue Book, follows:

The intervening years and a very mediocre memory do, of course, preclude my recalling the exact date, report date such as EHT, meteorological conditions at that altitude (which must have been about twenty thousand feet), names of observers, etc. I will, however, relate the incident to you to the best of my recollection.

The observation occurred in the hours just before noon in the early month of 1952 ( March, April, May or June.)

While standing on the front entrance steps of the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base hospital, I observed the approach of two UFOs upon a B-36 flying on a general east-west heading directly over the station. The objects appeared from the ground to be round in shape and metallic in color. (The same color as the B-36.) The objects approached the aircraft from the north-east at a speed about three or four times that of the aircraft.

The two objects appeared to be about the same size when first observed, one object appeared to gain altitude as it approached the aircraft because it seemed to grow smaller. It stationed itself as the B-36 passed just behind and to the port side of the B-36. The other object approached the aircraft at the altitude of the B-36 and stationed itself between the pusher-type prop spinners and the leading edge of the starboard elevator. The air crew, which landed the aircraft at DMAFB and were interrogated by me, confirmed the ground observed stationing of this object in this extremely close proximity to the aircraft.

I can no longer remember the length of time of the observation but all of the air crew members, except one who flew the aircraft through the war written this task to get to the technical observer, could verify this.

Two objects were reported to be symetrically convex top and bottom, about ten or twelve feet their from top to bottom and the middle of it's in as wide as easy configuration in an aerostatic figure one length (If I cannot judgment) one closer were reported by the air crew I remember to be between twenty or twenty-five feet in diameter. (This line angel) between spinners and elevator.)

One of the air crew members reported seeing a pale band of red color along the very bottom, the top and the edge of the objects All members did not about the color band, however.
