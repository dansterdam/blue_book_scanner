He said it was leaning some "away" which may have been the reflection of the sun. The object was silently and made "no noise whatsoever." He said it remained in the same position for about 5 minutes.

"Same time as a soldier in Arizona said he saw a pocket ships while you can tell that soldier that he wasn't seeing things because I believe I saw it too."

"You see it was that way back in 1947 we were out on the Atlantic fishing. It was just before sundown. A man and I had the feeling that somebody was staring at me. But nobody was looking at me."

"All of a sudden I looked up at the sky and there was this object. It looked to be at the moment like I could reach out and touch it. Other objects came to look at it, but all of a sudden it made two puffs of flame and smoke and was gone. It traveled a little way with the first puff, but with the second puff it was gone."

I have kept quiet about it all this time, but now I feel I must write and tell you about it. Signed MRS. _

The New Orleans Item of 17 October 1950, editorially speculated concerning the sighting of an unidentified object in formation by Miami Airlines, Inc., pilots, on the evening of 16 October 1950. The item concluded, "It is possible that the three persons signing the report are sincere and have spent two years investigating such reports." As said, "Definitely, most statements by well-known and reliable observers like these amaze, we hesitate to question the expert opinion of trained aerial observers and air-line pilots." 

ACTION: None contemplated by this Headquarters.
