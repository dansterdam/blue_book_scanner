Following is an extract from SDO Capt R C Webb's report of 20-21 June 1957 for your information:

"1900 - Returned from chow. Security and fire checked Bldgs 266 and 275 and the upstairs offices in Bldg 263. In my absence, a WO call from a local person 1635 - was given to SDNCO. He was unaware of necessity of filling out UFO Questionnaire. Lady said she saw a balloon just north of Vandalia field moving slowly North. No other information was gotten by SDNCO. I called Vandalia PK and they released a balloon at 1830 that slowly drifted North. This seems the probable explanation."
