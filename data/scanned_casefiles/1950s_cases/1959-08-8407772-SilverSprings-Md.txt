The text provided in the handwritten description on the form states the following:

"About 12:30 am my neighbor called me to come to my window to look at unusual object in the sky. I went to the window and observed an object that appeared to be very large, brightly lighted and was travelling at a high rate of speed in a southern direction. The object appeared to be several thousand feet in altitude and travelling much faster than conventional aircraft. After observing the object for approximately 30 seconds it disappeared from view or its lights went out. The weather was clear and visibility was good. During the observation the object did not seem to change altitude or direction and made no noise. This is all the information I can give on the object I observed."

My sister, my children and I first saw the object while watching a favorite television program. It appeared to be a circular object much larger and more brilliant than a television screen. At first we thought it was an airplane but as it came closer we saw that it had no lights on it and made no noise. It did not have the usual appearance of an airplane.

The object seemed about 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was white or silver in color. It appeared to be glowing or illuminated from within. It moved slowly across the sky at an estimated speed of 200 to 300 mph. As it moved, it changed directions and stopped and started several times. After watching it for about 10 to 12 minutes it suddenly accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared from sight in about 2 to 3 seconds. We all stood and observed it and discussed it for about 10 minutes then we said the thought it was other than any ordinary aircraft we had ever seen before. It was quite alarming but also interesting. We watched the clock to time it and believe the total time it was visible was about 12 to 15 minutes.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location Silver Spring, Maryland
Date 3 August 59 Hour (Z) 1645Z
WX Sl. breeze, scattered clouds.
Description 3 round objects, 2 were silver and one reddish size varied; first seen in the NW & approx 30 degrees above the horiz; disappeared to the north at approx 80 degrees; they were in an erratic formation, converging on one another; viewed for approx 15 minutes.
Direction of Motion Varied
Satellite: (AFGIN-4F3, Phone 69219) Ruled out
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) Ruled out
Radar Analysis (AFGIN-4E1) ---------
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc) Ruled out
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. Unusual sighting
Other -
Evaluation of Source Reliability Appears good - a professional
Analysis and Conclusions: The objects sited appear to have been of an unusual nature. Their flight characteristics, their size variations and disappearance above the horizon indicates that they were probably not of conventional aircraft, balloon, or astronomical origin. They were observed by an apparently reliable witness and no conventional explanation for their appearance could be determined from the information available.
