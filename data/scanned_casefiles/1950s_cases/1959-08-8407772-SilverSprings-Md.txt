About 10 p.m. my neighbor called for me to come to my back door and went into the back yard. She pointed to the sky and I saw these two objects, hovering high in a northwest direction. When they moved, it was with great speed, and when they were in the clear they would move in the same pattern. Then they would move up, stop, and while then they would repeat the same pattern going north and higher all the time. Then we heard a third object of the same shape and size. It was hovering very high 25 feet possibly an incident not like a light from within. We followed and decided while watching that we might see two or a light at all that the other reflection on the red metal of object was killed in the same sense the sun was high and to our number at wanted till the other this object performed their pattern across and of till they were distinctly under it. They were larger, brighter, and to our point of view, they were flying. I might add my neighbor and I could

My sister, my children and I first saw the objects while eating lunch. At first I thought they were kites because they were so large and then we noticed they were being guided. They slant so we watched for about 5 minutes from my kitchen window. The two silver ones were being all of the traveling. They appeared to have a moving motion. Softly they were spinning and what were paths #1 took #2 did the same. We would move up and #2 would take the position #1 took before as if #1 was guiding #2. I called my neighbor and ask her what she thought it was and we all stood and observed it for about 10 minutes then we saw the larger one standing in one position then high up. It was glowing a reddish and red interior and larger in size than the two silver ones. We watched the two silver ones travel across the sky to the red one, and when they...

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location Silver Springs, Maryland

Date 3 August 59                Hour (2)  16452

WX S1. Breeze; scattered clouds,

Description 3 round objects; 2 were silver and one red; size varied; first seen in the NW @ approx 30 degrees above the horiz; disappeared to the north at approx 80 degrees; they were in an erratic formation, converging on one another; viewed for approx 15 minutes.

Direction of Motion Varied

Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219)  Ruled out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) Ruled out

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1)  ------------

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.) Ruled out

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc., Probably Balloons

Other

Evaluation of Source Reliability Probably Good - Both

Analysis and Conclusions: The objects seen by these witnesses were probably balloons - both witnesses in interview indicated that at first they thought the objects were balloons. There is no good reason to believe that these objects were anything other than balloons - all objects went out of sight vertically.
