First observed obj at 40 deg in NW. Obj moved to 20 deg elev in East in 90 secs & then made a right angle turn where changed speed to the NE where it disappeared like a light point out. Statement that I heard no sound at any time. Statement later includes remark that during sighting he heard a roaring and buzzing sound.

11. COMMENTS
Rpt received in youth seven months after sighting. Heard roaring & buzzy/buzzing sound simultaneously. Reason for delay given was that it was his first sighting & he wanted to check on it. His final conclusion was it was no intelligently controlled spaceship & not from this planet gave no indication as to how this was reached. Case considered as unreliable rpt.

The text on this page is illegible. The image appears to be a document with multiple hole punches on the left side, but the text is too faint or blurry to be read clearly. The only visible text is the number "1769" in the top right corner of the page.
