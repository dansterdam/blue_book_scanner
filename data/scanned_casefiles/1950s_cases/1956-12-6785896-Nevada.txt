10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
AF pilot flying T-33 at 38,000 ft observed dazzling white ball of fire with long white trail falling earthward. Before disappearing appeared to burst or explode leaving rod glowing objects or streamers.

11. COMMENTS
Description and characteristics of object indicate that pilot apparently was in the very close vicinity of a fireball. Fireball shattered or lost fragments upon impact with the denser portion of the earth's atmosphere. Observing such a body at close range is generally considered a rarity. Opinion corroborated by ATIC astronomer.

2.A. WAS FLYING AT 38,000 FT, ON TOP OF ALL CLOUDS, PRPP PACIFIC TIME. WAS ALERTED BY BRIGHT FLASH THAT LIT UP ENTIRE AREA - AT FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS LIGHTING FROM BELOW, BUT LOOKED UP AND SAW THIS BRIGHT WHITE BALL, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE TRAIL & FALLING SPARKS. PASSENGER OBSERVED THE SAME AND CONCURS IN DESCRIPTION. THE INITIAL FLASH WAS BRILLIANT. WMB. WAS FLYING AT 38FT. HEADING 071 DEG MAG. OBJECT WAS AT 1200 O'CLOCK HIGH.

TRAIL WAS FROM THE POSITION TOWARD 0500 O'CLOCK POSITION, RT DEG DOWNWARD.2.C. AS ABOVE 2.D. AS ABOVE 2E. FADED OUT, AS A FALLING CELEST-AL BODY, ONLY WITH THE BRIGHT OBJECT AT THE INITIAL PHASE, AS OPPOSED TO THE FALLING STAR WITH THE BODY AT THE FRONT OF THE PATH.
