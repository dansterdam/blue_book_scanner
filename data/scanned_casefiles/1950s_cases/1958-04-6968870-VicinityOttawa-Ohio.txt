Unfortunately, most of the text on this page is too illegible for me to confidently transcribe. There is a blacked-out/redacted section at the top of the document, and the rest of the text appears faded and blurry. I can make out some words and fragments, but not enough to provide a complete and accurate transcription.

Most of the text on this page is illegible. There is a black redaction bar in the middle of the page, obscuring whatever text was originally present.

July 3, 1953

Dear Mrs.

Air Force files indicate two sightings on the 25th of April 1953, in Ottawa, Ohio. The first sighting occurred at 0320 zebra time and was evaluated as a meteor. The second sighting occurred eight minutes later and was evaluated as being the moon.

Your interest in Air Force activities is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM J. LOCKADOO
Lt. Colonel, USAF
