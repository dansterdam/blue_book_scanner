SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

SUMMARY:
On 13 February 1956, the Aircraft Dispatcher on duty in Base Operations, Grandview AFB, Mo., received the following information by telephone:

"At 2045 a Mrs. [blacked out] at Harrisonville, Mo. (telephone: call to report) stated that she though she saw an object in the sky that resembled a flying saucer over Harrisonville, Mo. Mass that the remembers. The first occurrence was 3 weeks ago. The next time was last Friday, 10 Feb 56 and again tonight, 13 Feb 56. The first time she saw the object she thought it was not very important, but then after seeing this object 2 other times, she thought she'd really see something. She stated that the strange looking object resembled a flying saucer that was very bright and moving slowly. The first time she saw this object it came from the east and then disappeared. Tonight she said the object made a circle pattern over Harrisonville, Mo., and then disappeared to the east. She said that when the object was brighter than any star in the sky and when it disappeared, it did not fall out of sight."

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:
There are many types of conventional and jet aircraft operating in the vicinity of Harrisonville, Mo. It is probable that what Mrs. [blacked out] actually saw were aircraft. (Information required by par 74, AFR 200-2, is not available to this hq.)
