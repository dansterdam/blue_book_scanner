COMMENTS
The fact that this object appeared to stand still for a long period of time and appeared close to the observer could indicate the possibility of a balloon. The reflection of the city lights could could account for the color. The usual time for the launching of radiosonde balloon is in the hour preceding the sighting. In the opinion of this org, the observer probably saw a balloon.
