Volume: 1972

In discussion with Col. [redacted]
of the Bio-Physics Lab - yesterday
this Some (who has sort in UFO report)
before 23 Feb 1954 C.C.
believed that Some was not of great
reliability:

1. How could one estimate a distance
of 100,000 feet at night?

2. Particularly if the size is doubtful
held up?

3. Even a B-36 would hardly be
seen at that altitude from the ground-height

4. How did he derive it a speed
of 1200 MPH + with time observation

5. This duration (about 5 minutes) casts
doubt the figure slow. Consider him -
unreliable source:

*See U.S. GoC Guide - A B-36 (from - hand daylight)
will look like a/c flying at only 1/2 miles -> ----

The document contains multiple hand-drawn triangular diagrams with various measurements and calculations, primarily focused on altitude, height, and speed calculations.

The image appears to be a scanned document with significant fading and blurring. While I can make out some text, much of it is illegible. Here's what I can partially read:

Some lines are partially visible, but the text is too faint or blurry to confidently transcribe. Large portions of the document are obscured by dark smudges and degradation of the original document.

I apologize that I cannot provide a complete transcription due to the poor image quality.
