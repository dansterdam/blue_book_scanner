The Time of Sputnik No. 2nd.

April 14th 1958

At about five to ten on Sunday night, as I was closing the front door. I noticed a peculiar glistening "blue" in the sky to the North, and on moving out into the veranda I saw an object a little smaller than the moon - dead North and travelling South slightly East. This object appeared as an aluminum ball, and was followed by ground twenty smaller objects, which were like balls with cones attached, and those were entirely red. The leading object which the East of Sunny did not appear to be further away than about two to three miles, and about 1000 to 1500 feet high, or not quite as high as the planes come in and around the course sometimes used by them. From the first object to the last was, meaning across the sky, about sixty to seventy feet, and the leader was then seen to be diving. There was no set order or positioning of the smaller objects, but they were definitely "glowing" red, and in other space occurrence "blue light." The time elapsed from when I saw it to the time I could take two minutes. In other words two minutes. In other words its forward speed was much faster than a plane, but it could be noticed to be frightening. Here is my weird picture.

As you will note the tail of the first object blossomed out, whereas the tails of the smaller which were attached to each bloomed in red dashes were also without heads.

[There is a hand-drawn sketch of several objects with tails/trails in the document]

[The bottom of the page contains some handwritten notes and numbered circles, but the text is not fully legible]
