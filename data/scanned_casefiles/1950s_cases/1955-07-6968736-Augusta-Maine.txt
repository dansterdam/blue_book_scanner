approx one minute

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
S to N

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One spherical object with a greenish hue and a trail 1 nine to ten miles long, trail was also green, was observed on radar, air-visually and ground-visually. It appeared to illuminate the sky as a ball of fire. A humming sound was noted.

11. COMMENTS
Although the duration of sighting was very long for the object to have been a meteorite, it is the conclusion that the object was probably a meteor. It is known that the trail of a meteorite is a good radar reflector and the description of the object fits that category.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
✔ Was Astronomical/Meteor
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical
□ Other
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
