Some text is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The parts I can make out include:

"A BY ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI"

Several paragraphs appear to be present, but most of the text is too blurry or obscured to confidently transcribe. The document appears to be a typewritten report with significant portions blacked out or degraded.

The bottom of the page seems to have a few lines of text, but again, most is not clearly readable.


- page 7 -

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

1. [Partially legible header section with some words visible]

2. Possible list of categories or sections:
- Possible time
- Conditions
- Possible features
- Possible color
- Other particulars

3. Main body text (partially legible):
"Went out to the place to clean the water tank and saw a bright light from the object rising dome-like my first time this particular night. While this object in plain view..."

[Large portions of the text are obscured by black redaction marks or are too faint/blurry to read with complete certainty]

4. Bottom sections appear to have additional text, but most is redacted or illegible.

The document appears to be a report about an unidentified flying object sighting, with significant portions of the text deliberately obscured.

Some text appears to be obscured or illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The words "CONFIDENTIAL" are visible at the bottom of the page.
