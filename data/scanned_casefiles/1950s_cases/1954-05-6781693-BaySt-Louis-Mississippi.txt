DATE OF SIGHTING: 25 May 54

LOCATION: BAY ST. LOUIS, MISSISSIPPI

INVESTIGATOR: Capt. W.L. Cates

SPECIAL INQUIRY

On 25 May 54 at approximately 2045 hours, a Mrs. REDACTED, residing at REDACTED, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, reported sighting a "strange object" in the sky.

The object was first sighted by Mrs. REDACTED while she was outside her home. It appeared in the northwest sky and was observed for approximately 5 minutes before moving out of sight. 

The object was described as round in shape, approximately 60-75 feet in diameter, and emitting a bluish-white glow. No audible sound was detected.

The object was at an estimated altitude of 2000-3000 feet and moved in a northwesterly direction at a moderate speed.

CONCLUSION: The object was probably a meteor or some other natural phenomenon.

No further investigation is warranted.
