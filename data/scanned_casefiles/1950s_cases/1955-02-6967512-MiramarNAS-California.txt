Subj: Observation of unidentified aircraft

1. At 1150 hours the morning of 2 February 1955, this officer departed Balboa Park in a private vehicle in route to the Naval Hospital Balboa Park, upon leaving the station from the east gate and turning right on highway 395 he proceeded due south. Then immediately off the east end of the main runway of the air station this officer observed 2 F3J aircraft, wing to wing and a F3J aircraft intersecting the F703 aircraft at a distance of approximately 100 feet on the downwind leg in the landing pattern. A second F3J aircraft trailing the first by approximately 500 yards appeared to this writer to have only one landing gear wheel extended. Sensing an emergency, this officer carefully observed the F3J in flight, as it leveled off on the downwind leg, both landing gear plus the nose wheel were down. Simultaneously I noted an object immediately aft and somewhat below the F3J. At first thought was a part of the airplane, possibly the canopy, had been ejected and was falling. The motion of the falling object was somewhat erratic, however it continued to descend at a steady rate of approximately 3 to 500 feet per minute. By this time it was obvious the descending object was not a part of the airplane. Being unable to ascertain exactly what the descending object was and not distinguishing spots before the eyes, I dirty mindedly of the object was not even certain due to concentration on the landing gear of the aircraft, I raised my glasses, rubbed my eyes, looked away for an instant and again concentrated on the descending object. Instead as I saw a white at an altitude, description, coloring etc. It was not possible to determine even a reasonably accurate altitude. However, I should say the object when first observed appeared to be somewhere between 10 and 20 thousand feet, probably closer to 20 thousand and decided 3 to 5 thousand feet from the original observed position, ultimately coming to a complete stand still for a period of 5 to 10 seconds. I was able to determine the object appeared off white in color and with an apparent highly polished surface since there was a bright reflection from the sun. I was further able to determine the object if considered as a sphere and from my location estimated at 3 to 5 miles distant at the 5 o'clock position a reddish brown color appeared and at the same time the object appeared to be a tremendous speed certainly not less than 1000 to 1500 miles per hour. A short vapor trail or exhaust of brown hue remained in the approximate position the object had been in prior to the extremely rapid acceleration. The vapor trail or exhaust quickly dissipated due to a fairly highly wind condition. The object took a course of approximately 170 degrees, running that highway 395.

runs reasonably true north and south at that point. It is with extreme
disgust that this officer is unable to give you anything like a realistic
dimension. I would hazard a guess the object was not less than 25 to 35
feet in diameter and could conceivably have been 100 feet in diameter.
The distance involved and the fact that this officer was unable to force
himself to properly evaluate the object precludes a very precise description.
I believe the object was of spherical or near spherical shape. Again the
distance precluded determining if the object was rooted on its axis, or if
there were any openings or protuberances. This officer has been serving in
Naval Aviation for approximately 26 years and is familiar with the normal
illusions one can see in connection with high speed, highly polished or
high gloss painted aircraft at high altitudes and other phenomena of a
similar nature. The object I observed today was not an aircraft in the
normal sense as we apply the term, it was a solid object, a definite mass
and was not a reflection or an optical illusion.
