In compliance with AF Letter 200-5, dated 29 April, 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) This single, orange-colored object, when viewed from a distance, appeared to be about the size of a pea or a basketball. It made its appearance with an explosive-like brilliance, and seemed to be been shaped. Its color, as observed by Mr. would be equivalent to a flame temperature of approximately 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. No aerodynamical features, will or exhaust, or propulsion system were observed. The object remained motionless, did not glow off any sound, and disappeared in much the same way as a light going out.

(2) This object or flash was observed at 1030 hours CST, and remained visible for from three to twenty seconds. The discrepancy here being due to the varying estimate of the observers.

(3) A visual surface observation without optical or electronic equipment was made.

(4) The object was observed from two different locations, and Billy Mitchell Village. The first observer placed the object in the Northwest sky. By measuring the angle of the object to the ground visually, and estimating the distance to be three miles, this observer figured the altitude of the object to be 5000°. The second observer spotted the object in the East sky, and estimated it to be at an altitude of 20,000 and 15 miles distant.

(5) This object was observed by Mr. and his wife, of noted above, is and his calculations of angle, color, temperature, etc., were performed with a rather meticulous thoroughness and certainty. The other observer was witnessed by his wife, and by Billy Mitchell Village. His sighting was witnessed by his wife, and by Billy Mitchell Village.

(6) At the time of the sighting the weather was warm. There were scattered clouds, and almost no wind.

(7) No activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise is known to have existed which may have accounted for the sighting.

(8) No physical evidence of the sighting exists.

(9) No interception or identification action taken.

(10) Location of air activity in the general area at the time of the sighting is unknown.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2230 hours, CST, 7 September 1952, my wife and I were visiting friends at Billy Mitchell Village. We were just leaving the residence when we noticed an unusual phenomenon in the west sky. A dark orange explosive-like flash mass appeared and remained visible for approximately three seconds then went out. This explosion appeared to be approximately fifteen miles distance at approximately twenty thousand feet altitude and appeared to be the size of a sea held at arms length.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

At 11:50 on the night of September seventh, 1952, my wife and I were sitting outside our house at [redacted] when suddenly we saw a cherry orange colored object appear in the Northwest sky. This object, or light, flashed on in much the same way as a firefly, and seemed to be about the size of a small dirigible. The object was at an angle of 50 degrees from the ground, only estimating its distance at 3 miles.

I figured the object to be at an altitude of 5000'. The object remained motionless, and in fifteen or twenty seconds it suddenly disappeared. Its particular color would be equivalent to a flame temperature of approximately 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. The object was been shaped, about twice as long as it was wide, and did not change in size, color, or brightness. Furthermore, it did not throb, pulsate, or give off smoke, and there was no sound. To the best of my knowledge this object could not possibly be explained by the presence of any conventional aircraft, but it comes to me that it could possibly be due to the ionization of air.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

1. On 6 September 1952, at 16:55 MST, [redacted] observed a bright, orange, tear-drop shaped object. The observation lasted for about two and one-half minutes during which time the object descended in a general southeasterly heading towards them and then disappeared on a reciprocal heading ascent until lost to view.

1. The object appeared to be tear-drop or pendant shaped, orange in color, 
and of unmistakable size. Throughout the observation there was no evidence of a 
propulsion system, and no noise. The first witness first sighted the object from her car while traveling towards Tucson. She informed her driver, 
the lookout into the sky and announced that she thought she saw a "saucer". The car was stopped and she and the driver concentrated on the strange object. It appeared from where they stood to be above the Grand Central Aircraft Plant at Tucson Municipal Airport. 
The object appeared to be whirling on its own vertical axis, and continued in a strange light. As they watched, the observers felt that the object descended toward them along a slanting path at great speed. They were careful to point out that 100 yards from the distance or size of the object they could not possibly estimate its speed, but that as it appeared to descend toward them they observed it to increase in apparent size as though its rate of descent was great. The object appeared to descend rapidly and then seemed to hover about 10 and 15 yards from their feet. The object, however, suddenly stopped, and without executing any sort of turn, began to ascend along the same path it had descended. It continued to ascend rapidly along a slanting path, until it became so small it could no longer be seen. In ascent its direction of whirl appeared to change from the direction of whirl during descent.

2. Time sighted, and length of time observed:
    a. 16:55 MST, Time sighted.
    b. 2½ minutes , Length of sighting.

3. Manner of observation: Visual only.

4. Location of Observer at time of sighting:
    a. On the Sahuarita highway near the Sahuarita Mountains.
    b. 31° 18' 15"W/ 110° 13' 20"W

5. Identifying Information on Observer and Witness:
    a. By way of background it may be said that Mrs. is one of the most 
highly esteemed citizens of Arizona. She has extensive business interests, including 
the Arizona Inn, which she has operated successfully for many years. She was a 
member of the Congress of the United States from Arizona.

    b. She has been the employee of for 19 years and is 
described by her as being Scottish, skeptical and conservative.

7.    Activities, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting:

    a.    No circumstances known to exist in the area at the time of the sighting would tend to explain or account for the phenomenon reported by 1878.  The weather was clear and the sun had not set.

8.    Existence of physical evidence:  None

9.    Interception or identification action taken:  None

10.   Comments of originators:
    a.    1878 is intellectual, clear-minded, and determined to avoid self-deception.  She must be regarded as a thoroughly credible witness.
