To Whom it may concern:

On Monday April 26 - 54 we were in the Newburyport Massachusetts yard when I heard a droning sound overhead, as I looked I saw a grayish white disc descending and laying off slightly in a Southwest-erly direction. It had no attachments to it. It was at a sixty degree angle traveling in a straight line with no sound after it had dropped. The time was between 3, 3:30 P.M. Sky clear with a few scattered clouds.

To whom it may concern:-

In the afternoon of April 27 I happened to be in the backyard of the house with my wife and heard a very heavy roar of what I thought were airplane engines. I tried to locate the noise but could not and did not see anything.

To whom it may concern.

Date of Occurrence - Monday April 25th, 1954 - between 3:30 & 4:00 P.M.

I was standing at the rear of the Newburyport High School building with two people. As I watched the sky, I saw a loud noise from the sky. It was a noise similar to a powerful motor, a noise which accelerated rapidly and died down rapidly. My first thought was of a rapidly approaching jet and yet the sound was more of a rotor character that a jet. Immediately afterward, skyward and east, a circular ring or rather strong intense disc was similar to this (5) with a protrusion within the ring circumference.

The object was moving in a northerly direction, slightly to the right, followed by a vigorous or smoky trail. As the object approached its aphelion intensity it seemed to stop and travel upward again in a right direction. Turning an angle between 135° to 60°. As the object appeared to recede it became less bright and took the appearance of a solid, quiet, disc, and then disappeared entirely from view.

The sound which I heard at the same time lasted for approximately 5 seconds, and the object was visible for about 30 seconds. When talking about the phenomena at house later in the evening, my daughter mentioned that she had also heard the noise with me. There were two or three other people that heard it.

My home is about 1/2 mile from the school where I was standing. My daughter is thirteen years of age, and I honestly believe that I was the first to hear this phenomena took place. The sky was only partially obscured with scattered high clouds. There were no clouds near the spot where the object appeared. The object was unquestionably at a very high altitude, and its also much brighter than the scattered clouds in the distance.

This is a true description of the object as I saw it.
