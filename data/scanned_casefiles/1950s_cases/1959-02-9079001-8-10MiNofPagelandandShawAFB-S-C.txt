Transcription of the text in the document:

Sighted in view of flight crew 1949 - 11 Feb 39
Charleston, S.C. Svc. Wpt. Grand 1430 CAS 11 1845 E. Heading 206 deg. CAS 130 kts. Alt 7000 ft.
The pilot, Chief Radar Operator said the object appeared to be heading straight towards the B-47. It suddenly changed direction and climbed rapidly up and away from the aircraft, disappearing in a matter of seconds. The object appeared to be round and white in color and seemed to have no visible means of propulsion.
Weather Wind 210 deg - 10 kt.
Charleston AFB, S.C. UFO discrepancy report.
National Aerodynamic and Astronomical Division - 15105-5-10-57.

(32" - 20")
May, Hackett

Capt. Charleston - with long experience on jet interceptors and the F - 86A and F - 94C. She states that the visual and radar reports are very similar to those received on many occasions when the object being tracked was a malfunction of the radar itself and proved to be an imaginary target. May, Hackett, SF Officer attached to the CAAB concurs on these conclusions.
