UNCLASSIFIED

Assistant Naval Attache
Tangier (Resident Casablanca) ANG 76-56                                11 April 1956

Manner of observation - ground-visual.

Time and date of sighting - 2015, 4 April 1956 (light condition - dusk)

Location of observer - Across from Admiralty in Front of the Jardin Publics, 
Casablanca, Morocco.

Identification of observer - M. Zahiri, o/a LA VIGIE MAROCAINE Newspaper, 
28, Bd Omar Tewfik, Casablanca, Morocco

Weather at time of sighting - Ceiling was 7-8 cloudy at 1700 meters.
Wind from the southwest, 15 knots.

1. SUMMARY: The object was viewed by another observer, Mr. Paul Hillion, who is 
attached to the local French Consulate, Casa Airpost, Casablanca, La Mamora, 
Casablanca.

"I left Casa Airport to go home at about 2100 on 5 April 1956. I like normal 
conditions (rue Mangin). As I was about to go on the gate to the hangar, I 
looked up the sky and saw something like a round fiery ball, an orange color, moved on the 
sky. It was useful for me to see it clearly. It was travelling eastward (on a perpendicular 
with the Angin) and in my trajectory that seemed to take it toward the sea. I took it for 
a meteor."

COMMENT: The locations of the two observers was separated by a distance of approximately 
one mile. Observer No. 2 (M. Tahiri) would have had more opportunity to keep the object 
under observation for a longer period of time than observer No. 2. It appears likely to 
be a meteor, however, this sighting is reported to make it a matter of record.
