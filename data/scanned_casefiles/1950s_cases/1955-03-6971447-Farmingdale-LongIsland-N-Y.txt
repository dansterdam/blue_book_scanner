Four (4), dull and reddish objects in a "V" formation were noted by observer while he was studying Jupiter through a telescope. Objects were not seen through the telescope but with the naked eyes. Observer states that these objects were definitely not astronomical in nature. Objects flew in a northerly direction and were observed for a period of ten (10) seconds. Manner of disappearance unknown.

11. COMMENTS
