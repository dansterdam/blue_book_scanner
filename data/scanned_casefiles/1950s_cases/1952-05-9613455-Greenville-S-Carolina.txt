The image appears to contain a typewritten report document from Project Blue Book, dated May 13, 1952. The report describes an incident that occurred on the same date at 2233 EST in Greenville, South Carolina, where four amateur astronomers observed a diamond-shaped formation of four oval-shaped objects in the sky. The objects were described as being relatively stationary and overhead, disappearing at an angle of about 12 degrees in three seconds. The report states that the sources believed these were geese, but that one observer was inclined to believe they were not.

The text of the report is as follows:

Description of Incident:
On 13 May 1952 at 2233 EST, four amateur astronomers observed a diamond formation of four oval-shaped objects. The objects were observed as distinctly overhead and disappeared in nearly overhead and disappearing at an angle of about 12° in three seconds. They were described as being relative in size to a half dollar, quarter turned, at arm's length. The objects appeared to wobble in their flight and bouncing oval-shaped maneuvers.

The night was extremely clear. The sources stated that there was haze and ground illumination near the city, but there were no ground lights near nor haze around the campus and that there were no ground lights near nor haze.

Two observers were inclined to believe these were geese.

The description of this incident is very similar to others from drive-in theaters and one from Fargo, North Dakota, on 22 April 1952, that were described as such lights hovering and stopping and starting very quickly. People in a dark area, which is essential for good astronomical observing, had seen similar escapes in a dark area, which is essential for good astronomical observing.

It is not known how much light a bird will reflect, but it seems logical that a relatively bright ground source of light would be needed.

As was stated, one source was sure they were geese but the other three were just as sure they were not.

The possibility of aircraft is nil since they passed directly overhead with no sound.

CONCLUSION:
Unknown

The text on the page describes a sighting by four astronomers in Greenville, South Carolina, who reported seeing several "objects" flying in the sky. The text states that the objects were "silently overhead, doubling several times before they went out of sight". It also mentions that the objects "had an oval shape, like that of a disc" and that "the disc was flying on its side".

Wing Intel: SYNOPSIS: 1st Lt ARTHUR S. PALMER, 375th Troop Carrier Squadron APS, received information from the Officer of the Day, 13 May 1952, that unidentified objects had been sighted by members of the Greenville, South Carolina, police force. There were approximately 2235 hours, 13 May 1952.

DETAILS: (1) Mr. JOHN MARTIN, Greenville, South Carolina, was interviewed by Lt. PALMER and made the following statement: "On the night of May 13, 1952, at approximately 2235 EST, four (4) objects, described as modified cylinder or obloid in shape, flying at an unknown altitude on a heading of about 305 degrees, were brownish orange in color and rather dull glowing in appearance." 

"These objects were in a diamond formation, almost directly overhead, going on a straight course, oscillating slightly, first one side would slip up then the other. They were in sight for about five (5) seconds."

Greenville, South Carolina, was interviewed by Lt. PALMER and made the following written statement:

The image contains a photograph, which appears to show some kind of unidentified aerial phenomenon or "UFO". The text describes a group of amateur astronomers who observed several objects in the sky over Greenville, South Carolina on the night of May 13, 1952. The objects were described as being brown or orange in color, possibly translucent and flying in a diamond formation. The objects were said to be moving in a zig-zag pattern, at an estimated altitude of 10-15 degrees.

The text in the document is as follows:

File 24-0, sub]: "Unconventional Aircraft sighted in Greenville, S. C."
Date: 13 May 1952

"On the night of May 13, 1952, at approximately 2235 EST, a group of amateur astronomers of which I was one, were preparing to observe the Purnell Gardens in Greenville, South Carolina. As we were setting up our equipment, this group called our attention to what they would say were four objects. These objects were a brilliant brown or orange color, possibly translucent and flying in a diamond formation. Each object was emitting a white glow (10) times the width of each object.

"They were flying about ten (10) to fifteen (15) degrees from directly overhead on a level course heading about 330 degrees. Although their speed was slower than jet aircraft, they were visible for only ten (10) seconds.

"Their flight was oscillating as nature, first five (5) degrees up on one side and at the same time down on the other."

South Carolina, was interviewed by Lt. FALLER and made the following written statement:

"On the night of May 13, 1952, at approximately 2235 EST, a group of amateur astronomers of which I was one, were observing the campus of Greenville Carolina. As we were setting up our equipment, this group called our attention to four (4) objects, self-illuminated, brown-ish or orange in color, which were at about three (3) seconds traveling or a level course slightly above the horizon. These objects were in a diamond formation."

"I was unable to estimate the altitude or speed of these objects. They traveled a distance of about 360 degrees wobbling in flight. Motion was similar to heavy winged birds in flight. It was a clear night, however, this did not pertain to the Purman Campus."

"My way of further description, I would say the objects were similar to the 'hubcaps' of an automobile, appearing perhaps also to be that of a half dollar held at arm's length and slightly turned."

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

The following report is submitted covering the incidents surrounding the sighting of an unidentified flying object at Greenville, South Carolina, on 9 May 1952.

On the night of 9 May 1952, at approximately 10:20 p.m., Group Sgt. L.L. Mogren and 4 other Airmen from the 28th Air Police Squadron, stationed at Donaldson Air Force Base, Greenville, South Carolina, observed an unidentified object in the sky.

The object was observed for a period of approximately 5 minutes. It was described as circular in shape, about the size of a nickel held at arm's length, and was a bright white in color. The object moved rapidly from north to south, made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the west, and then returned to its northerly course at a tremendous rate of speed. The object was observed to fade rapidly from view.

The weather was clear and the visibility excellent. No known aircraft was in the area that could be identified as the object sighted.

Mr. L.L. Mogren, of the 28th Air Police Squadron, submitted a written statement covering the details of this incident, a true copy of which is attached.

A CERTIFIED TRUE COPY.
