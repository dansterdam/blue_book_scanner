Description of Incident

On the night of 13 May 1952 at 2235 EST, four amateur astronomers observed a diamond formation of four oval-shaped objects. The objects were sighted visually from the ground. The objects were sighted nearly overhead and disappeared at an angle of about 12° in three seconds. They were described as being reddish-yellow or reddish-brown in color. They were relative to a half dollar, quarter turned, at arm's length. The objects appeared to wobble in their flight and being oval-shaped appeared to be flying sideways.

The night was extremely clear. The sources stated that there was haze and ground illumination near the city, but that there were no ground lights on the Furman University campus and that there were no ground lights near base.

One observer was inclined to believe these were geese.

Comments

The description of this incident is very similar to others from drive-in theaters and one from Fargo, North Dakota, on 25 April 1952, that were ducks. In this case, however, there were no ground lights in the area to reflect from a bird. This is borne out by the fact that those people had set up their telescopes in a dark area, which is essential for good astronomical observing.

It is not known how much light a bird will reflect, but it seems logical that a relatively bright ground source of light would be needed.

As was stated, one source was sure they were geese but the other three were just as sure they were not.

The possibility of aircraft is nil since they passed directly overhead with no sound.

Conclusion
Unknown

I.  SYNOPSIS: 1st Lt ARTHUR S. PALMER, 375th Troop Carrier
Wing Intelligence Officer, Donaldson AFB, South Carolina, received information from the Officer of the Day, 13 May 1952, that unidentified objects
had been sighted by members of a group of amateur astronomers at approximately 2233 hours, EST, 13 May 1952.

II. DETAILS, (1) Mr. [redacted], Greenville, South Carolina, was interviewed by Lt. PALMER and made the following written statement:

"On the night of May 13, 1952, at approximately 2333 eST, a group of amateur astronomers of whom I was one gathered on the Campus of Furman University, Greenville, South Carolina, for an evening of observing. As we were preparing to leave, I noticed four (4) objects, modified cylinder or obloid in shape, flying at an unknown altitude on a heading of about 300 degrees. These objects were brownish orange in color and rather dull glowing in appearance.

"These objects were in a diamond formation, almost directly overhead, going on a straight course, oscillating slightly, first one side (5) would tip up then the other. They were in sight for about five (5) seconds."

(2) Mr. [redacted], Greenville, South Carolina, was interviewed by Lt. PALMER and made the following written statement:

Area - 13 May 1952

"On the night of May 13, 1952, at approximately 2235 EST., a group of amateur astronomers of which I was one, were preparing to return home after an evening of observing from the Furman Campus located in Greenville, South Carolina. At this time, one of the group, called our attention to what I would say were four objects, each the shape of the goose without neck or tail. They were a luminous brown or orange color, possibly translucent and flying in a diamond formation. Distance between each object was about five (5) times the width of each object.

"They were flying about ten (10) to fifteen (15) degrees from directly overhead, on a level course heading about 350 degrees. Altitude I would say was below 1000 feet if they were about the size of geese. They were visible for about ten (10) seconds."

"Their flight was oscillating in nature, first five (5) degrees up on one side and at the same time down on the other."

Greenville, South Carolina, was interviewed by Lt. TALKER and made the following written statement:

"On the night of May 13, 1952, at approximately 2235 EST, a group of amateur astronomers, of which I was one, gathered on the campus of Furman University located in Greenville, South Carolina. We were catching really cold in an evening star watching near Kilgaston. One of the group, called our attention to four (4) oblong, self-illuminated, brownish yellow objects traveling in a diamond formation. These objects were in sight for about three (3) seconds traveling on a level course slightly arced to the left on a head of about 300 degrees.

"I was unable to estimate the altitude or speed of these objects. They traveled directly overhead, making no sound, and rather wobbling in flight. Motion was similar to heavy winged birds in flight. It was a clear, quiet night, excellent for astronomy. There was a slight ground haze over the city, however, this did not extend to the Furman campus where it was perfectly clear.

"By way of further description, I would say the objects were similar to the 'Lubbock Lights' as reported in Life magazine. Approximate size would be that of a half dollar held at arm's length and slightly turned."

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I, the undersigned, have the following information concerning an unusual sighting which is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

On the night of May 15, 1952, at approximately 9:25 P.M., a group of amateur astronomers, of which I was one, gathered on the campus of Furman University located in Greenville, South Carolina. We were setting up telescopes and making observations when one of the group, called our attention to some (4) colored, self-illuminated bright objects in the northwestern sky.

These objects were in the form of a (5) second arc, one of several course slightly raised to the left on a heading of about 300 degrees.

I was unable to estimate the altitude or speed of these objects. They were definitely overhead, moving in a smooth, even flight. Motion was similar to have passed over by birds in flight, with a close, quiet night, excellent for astronomy. There was a slight ground haze over the city of Greenville that night, but the sky was clear then.

By way of further description, I would say the objects were similar to the "Lubbock Lights" as reported in Life magazine. Approximate size would be that of a half dollar held at arm's length.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I, M.G., make the following statement concerning an unusual sighting, which is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

On the night of May 16, 1952, at approximately 2235 EST, a group of amateur astronomers of which I was one were preparing to return home after observing from the Furman Corpus located in Greenville, South Carolina. At this time, one of the group called our attention to what I would say were some objects, each that a shape of a goose without head, tail, and wings were moving in continuous color, probably in a diamond formation. Distance between each object was about five (5) times the width of each object.

They were flying about ten (10) to fifteen (15) degrees from directly overhead on a level course near height, about 330 degrees altitude. I would say about 1000 feet, very high for their size for about ten (10) second.

Their flight was clearly time in nature, first five (5) degrees up on one side and to the same time down on the other.

On May 13, 1952 was one of a Group of five members attending a meeting of an Astronomy Club of the Furman University. We were on the Campus between Main and the Science Building with several other companions. I was then comparing constellations including that of Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Pegasus. We had completed our study of spiral, double and multiple star systems and were conversing through the telescope through the Conn telescope about the atmosphere of Saturn. We found the atmosphere to be remarkably clear that evening. A clear view of Saturn and its rings.

At approximately 10:30-11 P.M. one of the group called attention to an object passing through the zenith.

This turned out to be low white object to be low white object of roughly yellow tint. It was most closely resembling from that time the object was first noticed to its disappearance, a very vague formation, due to its advance. We were able to note some deviation, gravity, some deal of deviation. The object appeared to be mobile. It was a long length from out of the CL... (rest of text partially illegible)
