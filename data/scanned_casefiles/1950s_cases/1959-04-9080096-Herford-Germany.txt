REMARKS:
1. This analysis concerns an UFO sighting by a private subject.
2. The description is characteristic of a meteor. It was a bright object moving rapidly on a downward trajectory. Its motion was very impressive, as described by the "flying saucer" book he had just finished, and was similar to a "saucer".

REMARKS:
1. This analysis concerns an UFO sighting by a British subject.
2. The description is characteristic of a meteor. Source states it was a meteor, yet he reported it as a UFO, probably out of curiosity. The facts indicate this case was just finished, and was amazing to see a "saucer".

Dear [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 11 April 1959 concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object.

The description is characteristic of a weather balloon which we have probably considered as having been viewed such a phenomenon.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,

I seem to satisfy somewhat my curiosity regarding the object I sighted the night of 12 April 1959, 22:45, with the following details:

At the time, it was a very clear night, and I was looking out a window in the direction of the Herford military airfield. Suddenly, I observed a bright, bluish-white light directly overhead, moving at a very high rate of speed and in a straight line. The light was definitely not an aircraft, as it made no sound and did not blink or exhibit the normal characteristics of an airplane or other known aircraft. It was only visible for approximately 3 to 4 seconds before disappearing from sight.

Having sighted the phenomenon, I was greatly puzzled, as I could not identify the object. The stars with which it was contrasted were clearly visible, and the light itself was very bright, larger than a normal aircraft light, and of a distinctly bluish-white color.

I feel certain that the object was not a meteor or other natural phenomenon, nor was it any type of known aircraft. I have no explanation for what I observed, and I would be most interested in any information your department may have regarding similar sightings in this area.

Sincerely yours,

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

Had a very unusual look about it. i saw on the night of 3/11/59 that a bright object was motionless and remained in one position for some 30 min. or so. It seemed to be hovering low over the trees. Size was about the size of a man's hand held at arm's length. It had a bright yellow-orange inner core and was surrounded by a bright white glow. I saw no engines, wings, or other visible means of propulsion. The object seemed to be self-luminous.
