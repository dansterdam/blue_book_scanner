MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

UNCLASSIFIED                    2nd OSI Detachment (DO)
                                Ernest Harmon Air Force Base
20 490-07                       13 May 1953

SUBJECT: Unidentified Sightings at Sheave's Cove, Newfoundland

1. On 7 May 1953 Major JACK P. NUTT, Area Intelligence Officer, contacted Major WILBUR W. O'NEIL, Detachment Commander, and informed him that there had been reports of unidentified sightings during the period of March and April 1953 in the vicinity of Sheave's Cove, Nfld.

2. On 8 May 1953 the writer and S/A FRANK and Constable ERNEST GORMAN, RCMP, Stephenville, Stephenville, Nfld, interviewed stated that some time in March 1953 he was walking along the road with his brother shortly after dusk. At this time he noticed the road behind him nearly behind his "lit up" and thought that it was a maximum behind him with bright head lights on.

Quarters mile away and approximately 650 ft in elevation from shoulder height is approximately 5160 ft in height. He stated he observed this light for approximately 75 yards. He was traveling from a southeast direction to the southwest over St. George's Bay. The light appeared similar to a light bulb with a "tail on it".

The light was long and four inches wide and was the color of the flame of a kerosene lamp. Further questioning revealed that for a radius of approximately 75 yards the road was lighted up by this object in the sky. The observer stated he last observed the light falling toward the bay in a downward arc and when further questioned that the "body" part of this object was circular and approximately 12 to 15 inches in diameter.

Approximately 170 hours, he stated that on 11 April 1953 at approximately one to two seconds, he also stated that this light, which he viewed at the area lighted from this object, also appeared like a light bulb and that it was approximately 18 inches in length and again was the color of the flame of a kerosene lamp. He stated he did not observe any of the immediate area lights from this object but could not estimate the distance the object was from him but stated that it appeared to be falling toward St. George's Bay and was traveling "three stages as a falling point".

YOUNG further stated that he had heard that residents of ARNOLD POINT, Nfld., had observed unidentified lights in the sky.

Memo for the File

3. On 8 May 1953 the writer, in the presence of S/A PAGE and Constable CORRIGAN, interviewed Mrs. [illegible] who stated that she and her son, [illegible] observed the light on 14 April 1953 at approximately 1930 hours, and stated substantially the same as [illegible]

4. On 8 May 1953 the writer, in the presence of S/A PAGE and Constable CORRIGAN, interviewed [illegible], Canadian National, Sheaves Cove, 17 years of age, who stated that on 14 March 1953 he was walking along the road with his brother, [illegible], who called his attention to a light in the sky. [illegible] stated he observed the light and it then changed a large light bulb and its elevation was approximately 60 feet and was 75 yards away from him and appeared to be from a northwesterly direction. [illegible] stated the object was orange in color and was dropping steadily in a downward arc toward SE. [illegible] that when he last saw it, it was traveling in a southerly direction. Further questioning of [illegible] revealed that on approximately 20 April 1953 he had observed a lighted object in the sky approximately two miles away which was traveling in a south south easterly direction; that this light appeared to be approximately six inches in diameter and that there was no bright glow and it appeared to be traveling "slower than an airplane". [illegible] approximated the elevation from approximately 450 to 600 feet and stated he observed this light for approximately 15 seconds and that he heard no noise from it and that when last seen, the light had dropped down over a hill out of sight. [illegible] stated that the American from the base had also seen this object.

5. On 8 May 1953 the writer, in the presence of S/A PAGE and Constable CORRIGAN, interviewed [illegible], Canadian National, Sheaves Cove, who stated in substance that at approximately 0530 hours, 17 October 1952 he and [illegible] were walking into the woods at Sheaves Cove or-[illegible] with a kerosene lantern sitting; expecting that they were carrying an ordinary kerosene lantern; that they noticed it beginning to become very light in the area and on looking into this air saw a round ball of fire of approximately the same color as the flame from a kerosene lamp approaching. From a southerly direction; that the ball of fire passed to the right of them and disappeared over a hill approximately 600 feet in height; that as it disappeared from sight it looked as though it was traveling in a downward arc toward the ground and just as it passed from sight a large number of sparks burst forth from the ball of fire. [illegible] stated that when the ball of fire passed over he had looked up the area so much that the only object dimmed out the light from the lantern; that he could not estimate the amount of time required for the object to pass from the first point of observation in the south to the point where it disappeared over the hill to the northly, but he stated that it appeared to be traveling at two or three times the rate of aircraft: normally seen flying in the area. [illegible] stated that his wife also observed light then object on the same morning.

6. On 8 May 1953 the writer, S/A DRAKE and Constable CURAHAN interviewed Mrs. who related substantially the fact that just at daylight on the morning of 17 October 1952 she was awakened by a flash of light that she looked outside and noticed that the whole area was lighted by a white reflection. She did not see the source of the lights; that the reflection lasted for only a few seconds and was apparently the appearance of light reflected on the ground from chain lightning.

MATHISON, AF 15225350, 5603d Air Base Squadron, Air Police Station, who stated that he observed the light with both his aircraft on approximately 20 April 1953 and that he is positive that it was an aircraft in which had the navigation or landing lights on.

9. On 8 May 1953 the writer, DRAKE and CURAHAN canvassed the area of Marche Point, Newfoundland, for residents who have seen any unusual lights or sightings. Negative results were obtained.
