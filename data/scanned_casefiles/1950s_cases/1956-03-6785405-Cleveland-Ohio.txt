GIT STATION 4137

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 

1. At approximately 1940 hours on 6 March 1956, the writer was informed by the control tower operator at the CLEVELAND LAKEFRONT AIRPORT, Cleveland, Ohio, that an unidentified flying object had been sighted and reported to the airport tower.

2. The control tower operator stated that the object had been sighted by several persons on the ground in the vicinity of the airport, and that the object appeared to be a bright light in the sky moving in an erratic, zigzag manner. He further stated that the object disappeared from view momentarily and then reappeared at a different location.

3. The writer immediately contacted the Cleveland Airport control tower and verified the report, Efforts were made to determine the exact time of the sighting, the duration of the observation, the direction of flight, and any other pertinent details from the control tower operator.

4. The writer was unable to be dispatched to the area of the reported sighting due to the fact that no aircraft were available at the time and the sighting had occurred some 15 - 20 minutes prior to the notification.

5. The object was not tracked on radar at any time, nor was any photographic evidence obtained. The writer was unable to conduct a field investigation of the incident.
