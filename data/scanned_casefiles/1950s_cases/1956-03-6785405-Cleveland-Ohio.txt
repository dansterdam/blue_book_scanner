Here is the text I can read from the document:

Multi

26 MAR 56 00 C-1

[The rest of the text is mostly illegible due to poor image quality and low contrast]

In the top right corner, I can also see some handwritten markings:
3 AE 4
4-7-56
(with a small circled notation)

The page number "9" is visible in the top right corner.

The text in the image is largely illegible due to poor image quality and faded typewriting. While some words and fragments are visible, I cannot confidently reproduce the full text with certainty. The document appears to be a typewritten report with multiple paragraphs, but the specific content cannot be definitively determined from this scan.
