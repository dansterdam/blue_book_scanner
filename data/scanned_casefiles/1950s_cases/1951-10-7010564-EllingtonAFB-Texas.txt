The following information was obtained from W-P AFB Weather Station on 22 October 1951.

The winds aloft for the Columbus, Ohio area at about 1300 on 2 Oct 1951 were:

a. SW at 10 - 15 knots up to 5000'.
b. WSW to W at 15 - 20 knots from 5000' to 20,000'.

Weather balloons are launched at 1500, 2100, 0300 and 0700 EST all through the eastern time zone.

********* *********

CONCLUSION

Since Source states the object was traveling directly west, it could not have been a balloon as it would have to be traveling into the wind if it were above 5,000' or nearly into the wind at below 5,000'.

In addition, if a balloon were released at 1500, in the three hours from launching until sighting it would have risen too high to be seen.

Lt. Col. M. J. Pistintza                                                                      October 9, 1951

Source looked up into the air to observe the DC-3 because the DC-3 sounded considerably more noisy than was normally expected. As the source looked away, he caught sight of a light above and to the west of the DC-3. His first impression was that he had observed a flash which caused his eye to return to the origin. The next impression was that the object was a balloon. He continued to look at the object to notice any ascent or descent. In continuing to watch for an ascent or descent, he noticed that this object was not ascending and concluded that it might be a parachute. The shape of the object (an incomplete circle or sphere) as it appeared to the source at this time was such that he concluded that it might possibly be a parachute. Continued observation of the object showed that it did not descend; the source concluded that it was not a parachute. Additionally, the size of the object suggested that it was traveling at high speed in a westerly direction. Although the size of the object cannot be established, when it was first noted in the position above the DC-3, it appeared to have a size somewhat smaller than the DC-3 fuselage.

Evaluation

1. Orientating Agency's Evaluation of Source Reliable.

2. Source's Opinion of His Information; Due to the nature of the object which was observed, that is, the slow, the source took the trouble to move his glasses back and forth in order to assure himself that he was not seeing a reflection through his glasses. The source does not believe that he saw a reflection due to the sun, primarily because the sky was reddening in the west and the eastward side of buildings in the area were shaded and darker than the rest of the sky.

The original brightness of the object, its straight-line path, its gradual fading from sight as though getting farther away, and the length of the period of observation assured the source that the object was of a real origin and not due to reflection from the ground or false visual perceptions caused by looking into the sky.

Dear Colonel Pitnintitza:

Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft

The following information regarding the sighting of an unconventional aircraft is forwarded as a matter of interest pertaining to your Center:

A. Source

Graduate physicist, no aircraft experience, age 29, member permanent staff Battelle Memorial Institute.

Date of Sighting: Tuesday evening, October 2, 1951.
Ground Detail: weather clear; sun behind a building and could not be seen; darkness just beginning to set in.

At the time of the sighting, a twin-engine aircraft - probably a DC-3 scheduled airliner - was observed. The source was seated in a car in a parking lot on the campus of The Ohio State University. The DC-3 was heading directly east with an estimated altitude of 1000 feet.

The unidentified object was heading directly west at an altitude higher than that of the DC-3. The exact altitude cannot be estimated. The attached drawing shows the source's opinion of what he saw as far as configuration of the unconventional aircraft. No sounds were heard associated with this identifiable object. The pattern of flight seemed straight with no change in altitude or maneuver. The duration of the sighting was approximately one minute.

B. General Comments

The story of the sighting of the unidentified object is as follows:
