II. RELIABILITY: Source appeared of average intelligence, willingly replied to all questions posed and was able to determine information and dimensions reasonably accurately. Earnestly attempted to formulate a possible cause for the sighting observed but unable to explain. Imaginative.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source volunteered the following summary description of the sighting:

"Have seen this object many times. Every time these objects appear in different directions, and act in many different ways as to which way it travels and where it moves up. One night was watching what appeared to be this object at Mr. _______, looking toward Ducktrap (GEORGE EITQ 6918) Mountain and seemed to come right toward the house. Both fields of light and one divided by a stone wall seem to light up fairly bright with a red glow. This was not Northern Lights."

Source further stated that the light appeared about East and fairly high in the sky. Then, over a period of fifteen to twenty minutes dipped toward the Southeast and disappeared below the trees. Had seen the light at several occasions, from April 1958 on, to dates mentioned in this report. Source could not offer an explanation for the cause of the reddish glow.

4. Resident Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at Bangor, Me., (GEOREF HQG 1448) was contacted by 2nd Lt. Charles R. Clay, Air Police Base Flight Office, Dow AFB, Maine, for any possible derogatory information concerning the sources involved in the sightings. No information available.

5. An aerial search of the areas of the sighting was conducted by 2nd Lt. Charles R. Clay, utilizing an H-19 type Helicopter based at Dow AFB, Maine. Search was conducted at an altitude of 60 feet terrain altitude and lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Search was conducted to determine if there were any relatives who could possibly have made the sighting report. Negative results.

6. Two GCI radar sites responsible to Dow AFB, Maine, were contacted through 2nd Lt. Charles R. Clay for any possible radar contact with objects in the area of sighting on the dates indicated. Negative results.

7. The US Coast Guard Mooring Station, Rockland, Maine (GEOREF HQG 5467), was contacted concerning water traffic on the dates indicated and concerning the location of light houses in the vicinity of the sighting. In the absence of the Station Commander, Warrant Officer Litchfield, his next in Command, Chief A.W. McLaughlin, BMC, Service # 224593, submitted the following weather and light data:

a. Lighthouses:
(1) Eagle Island (GEOREF HQG 1313)
Fixed White Light, 106 feet above mean water level, 1,700 candle power, maximum visibility 16 miles.

(2) Curtis Island (GEOREF HQG 5713)

b. Water Traffic

Chione stated that the Ferryboat crossing between Ducktrap Harbor, Maine (OSORIS) ETIC 9218), and Islesboro, Maine (OSORIS) ETIC 9418) could possibly produce the sighting if the Ferryboat were crossing with the aid of a strong searchlight. This Ferryboat is primarily used for auto transport for vacationists to the island of Islesboro, Maine. This Ferryboat does not operate on a fixed schedule and attempts to contact the crew of this Ferryboat met with negative results. Chione further stated that weather conditions on the dates indicated would rule out the possibility of water traffic causing the sighting, and that the Ferryboat most likely would not attempt the crossing in the weather present at the time of the sighting.

Comments of the Investigators:

1. In view of the information obtained, personnel assigned to investigate the sighting believe the object to be the star "ARCTURUS".

2. On 23 July 1958, at 2330 hours (EST Daylight Saving Time), the investigators observed the object in the sky. The object was pointed out to the investigators by Mr. W. as the that light which he had been observing for several months, and as the object reported as the sightings of 26, 27 and 28 June and 11 July, 1958 respectively.

3. The object was definitely a star, established in a position due south and west from the "Big Dipper" star group. The star appeared to be jumping when viewed through a pair of glasses (7.35 power) as viewed through a telescope (Bausch & Lomb) with a 60 millimeter lens. The color changes were caused by fog and mist passing between the observers. The color changes were from white to bright amber.

4. The object was in sight for approximately thirty (30) minutes and did not change its position or move about as reported by the sources. The object was finally obscured by heavy fog.

Saturn and Jupiter Visible

Three bright stars now seen in the eastern sky will become even more prominent in upcoming months. June 21 marks official beginning of summer in Northern Hemisphere.

By JAMES STOKLEY

BRILLIANT JUPITER, to the southeast, is now rising higher each night and will be a striking sight in the coming weeks. With its attendant moons, it is one of the most interesting objects in the sky. Three of these planets are shown on the accompanying map, which depicts their positions at about 10:30 p.m. one can know the standard time (add one hour for daylight saving time) and the position of the planets at the middle of the month.

The stars are the background against which the man-made earth satellites can be seen. Jupiter, in the constellation of Virgo, is the most prominent.

With Jupiter visible to Spica, a star that is just below Lyra, the sky this month will offer an interesting movement of the planet. It is readily seen. If you have been watching its motion in recent months, you will have noticed that it has been moving steadily among the stars since Feb. 15. This is called its "retrograde" motion. Actually, Jupiter, like the earth, is going around the sun in the same direction, which is from the west toward the east, but the nearer a planet is to the sun, the longer the apparent "backward" motion appears. Jupiter is now past its most westerly point, compared with 8.1 nips for Jupiter's motion.

With the earth, Jupiter appears to pass it has pulled past the outer planet, however, toward again. The backward motion is now backward, toward the west. In the same way, it will be traveling on an apparent path and pass a bright train on the west track. The slower bright may again be seen moving in the same direction that it is now in the same direction that you see it. On Feb. 15 the earth began to pass Jupiter. By June 19 it will have pulled by and Jupiter will resume its usual direct, or easterly motion among the stars.

Mars, the earth, is now passing Saturn. Also, 24 it will resume its normal eastward movement. (9,980,000 miles away) on June 15, Saturn, whose orbital speed is 8.6 miles a second, is also moving backward among the stars. A few of the northern most stars in this constellation are shown on the map of the

Bright Stars in East

In the east you will find three bright stars that will become even more prominent during the coming months. These are Vega, in Lyra, which is just rising; the Swan, which is just below Lyra; and Altair, in Aquila, the eagle, to the right of Vega.

Another name for the swan is Cygnus, which is now seen in a partially inverted position, for Deneb is at the head of the triangle.

The Great Dipper, part of Ursa Major, the great bear, stands high in the northwest. Dubhe and Merak, the "pointers" in the bowl of the dipper, are below it to the left. If you draw a line through these two stars toward the pole star, in Ursa Minor, the lesser bear.

The dipper's handle forms a guide to offer prominent stars. If you follow it toward the south, you come to brilliant Arcturus in Bootes. Continuing still farther, you come to Spica in Virgo.

In June, although Mercury is too close to the sun to be seen, Venus and Mars are visible later in the night.

"First observed in the East early in March 1958. Appeared at distance to be jumping star. Does change color very vivid. Green, Red, Blue, Amber. Appears to get smaller as it gets near. Sometimes goes straight up and disappears, other times drops down behind trees."

Source referred to a color plate in July 21 1958 issue of "LIFE" magazine, page 81 thereof, stating that the light mentioned "looks some portion of the illustration mentioned".

Source took photographs of the object and surrendered nine (9) negatives and nine (9) prints to the Investigators.

Source volunteered the following concerning the photographs:
Film used: "KODAK 1600" (size "127")
F-stop: 3.5
Exposure-time: 1 second
Camera: "Reflex" type, make unknown (not stated by Source)
Supplementary light: 110V AC flood light.

II. RELIABILITY: Source gave the appearance of an elderly and gullible woman without ability to find directions or judge dimensions. Source replied willingly to all questions but was subject to self-delusion. Investigators do not consider Source reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source volunteered the following summary statement concerning the sighting:

"Also, in the back field, about 3:30 a.m. of July 10th, about 300 yds from the house, an aluminum cloud round disc, about 8" in diameter was poised about 12 or 15 feet off the ground, until Mr. [name redacted] went to the light on a 12 - an extremely and horizontally went to the right of the field, passing in back of an apple tree into a clump of small birches & that was all. In the Amt. about 8, I went up and looked the place over, but found a good sized piece of paper badly singed & smelling strongly of saltpeter - it could have been sulfur."

During the interview Source constantly referred to an artist's conception of space men working on a space station, as illustrated in the July 1958 issue of "COSMOPOLITAN" magazine, and insisted that images on some photographs submitted with the report looked exactly like the bank of one of the men shown orbiting in the magazine illustration, whereas others showed a face of one of the alleged space men.

Source had kept a kind of "rough log" concerning the sightings and made a considerable show of frequently referring to entries therein.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was sincere in all his statements, had fairly accurate judgement of distances from known objects. Source was critical of information given, and was cautiously trying to associate the sighting with some known object that could possibly produce the same effect. Source gave information freely and was very cooperative.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 26 June 1958, Source was called to the residence of Mr. [redacted] Northport (GEORGE RJC 5722), Maine to witness the sighting of an object in the sky near the home of [redacted]. Source made the following statement concerning the sighting:

"Looking about Southeast from the front of the house, which is out in the country, I saw a bright orange or amber light, about the size of a baseball, move from left to right, then down, so that it almost went into the ground. I then took back up into the sky about 30° degrees then due to heavy fog which was coming in at the time, fade from sight. I believe this light was nothing more than an optical illusion caused from a bright star I had seen before in that general direction, that the fog, and a body of water caused this."

Source first sighted the object at 1910 hours, EST (Daylight Saving Time) from a Southeast direction at 20° degrees above the horizon. The object was observed in this position for about 30 seconds, then moved toward the right on a straight line for approximately 4 seconds, then right and down in a curving line for approximately 8 seconds, then straight up to a position of 30° degrees above the horizon. Source stated that the object increased in speed down to 30° degree position which took only 2 seconds. Total time of sighting was 10 minutes.

Source stated that the object gave the appearance as that of a strong 6-cell flashlight, looking directly into the beam of the light. Source further stated that he had been light pattern viewing and had broken power lines, but the sighting in question did not resemble anything he had seen before, except for a bright star brought to his attention by his 7 year old son the week prior to the date of the sighting. Source firmly believes that the light was caused by this star.
