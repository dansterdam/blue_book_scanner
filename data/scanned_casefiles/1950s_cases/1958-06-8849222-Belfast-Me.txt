2. The Brunswick, Maine Naval Air Station (CODREP RTJP #455) was contacted for any air traffic in the area on the dates indicated.

3. The Base Operations Officer of Dow Air Force Base, Maine, (CODREP RTJP 1448) was contacted and information concerning any military air traffic in the area on the dates indicated. 

4. Incident Date: 1 September 1958: Lieutenant Edmund Bruecker, Jr., RCAF Liaison Officer, was contacted by 2nd Lt. Charles H. Olley, USAF, Deputy Base Air Police Commander, concerning the reports received about the sightings.

5. An intensive visual and radar search was conducted by 2nd Lt. Olley with negative results. The search was conducted at an altitude of 20 feet to terrain altitude and lasted for approximately 10 to 12 minutes. Search was conducted to determine if there were any reflective materials in the area that could produce the sightings reported. Negative results were obtained.

6. Two GCI radar sites responsible to Dow AFB, Maine, were contacted through the Base Operations Officer. They could provide no information concerning any airborne objects with objects in the area on the dates in question.  

7. The US Coast Guard Mooring Station, Rockland, Maine (CODREP RTJP 5/027), was contacted. Concerning water traffic on the dates indicated and concerning the location of light houses in the vicinity of M. T. Michielchfield. His reports stated the following weather and light data:

Lighthouses:
(1) Eagle Island (CODREP RTJP 1312)
Flashed White Light: 106 feet above mean water level, 1,700 candle power; maximum visibility 16 miles.
(2) Curtis Island (CODREP RTJP 5713) 
Flashed Green Light: 25 feet above mean water level, 800 candle power; maximum visibility 13 miles.
(3) Fort Point (CODREP RTJP 1312)
Flashed White Light: 88 feet above mean water level, 1,400 candle power; maximum visibility 15 miles.

Chief McLaughlin stated that the overcast would cut light intensity to one quarter (.75) of the clear nights values, and the light houses appear to almost nothing.

D. WATER TRAFFIC:

Describes that the Ferryboat, crossing between Rockland Harbor, Maine (OSCNRP BLKT 2182), and Islesboro, Maine (OSCNRP BLKT 2182), which was operating between the two points, was ferrying civilians and auto transport for vacationers to the island of Islesboro, Maine. This Ferryboat does not appear to have any meteorological relation or connection with the crew of unidentified aircraft. Weather conditions on the dates indicated would rule out the possibility of weather traffic causing the sighting, and that the Ferryboat most likely would not attempt the crossing under such weather conditions.

Comments of the Investigators:
1. In view of the information received and the personnel assigned to investigate, the sighting appears to be the star "ARCTURUS".
On 23 July 1958, at 2320 hours (EST) the object was pointed out to the investigators, who observed it for several months, and it was the object reported as the sightings of 26 and 27 June 1958.
2. The object was definitely a "star", established in a "tail to be jumping" pattern characteristic of the double star system viewed through a telescope (Bausch & Lomb) with a 40 millimeter lens, due to the lazy moving character of the object, which was observed by the investigators.
3. The object was in sight for approximately thirty (30) minutes and did not change its position or move about as reported by the sources. The object was finally obscured by heavy fog.

SATURN AND JUPITER VISIBLE 
Though they may be dim at the moment, Saturn and Jupiter will become even more prominent in upcoming months. June 21 marks the beginning of summer in the northern hemisphere.

BY JAMES STOKLEY
Jupiter, bright in the southern sky, is now an evening star. Saturn, its rings now turned somewhat toward the earth, is visible during the early evening hours. Both planets will remain in view throughout the summer months.

Toward the end of June, Saturn will be in the south during the evening twilight. As the summer progresses, it will appear farther toward the west each evening. By September, it will be setting shortly after the sun. 

Jupiter, on the other hand, will be rising earlier and earlier each evening and will be well up in the sky by the time the stars appear. It will be south at midnight or later throughout the summer months.

In addition to these two giant worlds, a number of other interesting celestial objects will be on view. Brilliant Venus, morning star in the east, will grow lower in the sky as the weeks pass. The reddish star Antares, marking the heart of the Scorpion, will be toward the south during the evening. To the west, Arcturus, the orange giant, will shine as one of the brightest stars in the evening hours.

The two bright star patterns, the Dipper of Ursa Major and the Scorpion, now prominent in the southeast and south, are among the most easily recognized configurations in the sky.

Though normally fainter, other planets - Mercury, Mars, and Neptune - may at times be seen this summer. Their motions can be followed with the aid of the star map which shows their positions on various dates.

Bright Stars in East
In the east, you will find three bright stars, Altair, Vega, and Deneb, forming the large Summer Triangle. This triangle, tilted high in the sky during the evening hours, is one of the most noticeable star patterns of the summer.

Altair, to the southwest, is the brightest of the three. Vega, in the middle, is second in brilliance, while Deneb, in the northeast, is the faintest of the trio.

To the north, the bowl of the Big Dipper is high in the sky, and the Little Dipper also can be seen. The North Star, Polaris, marks the end of the handle of the Little Dipper. During the evening hours these northern star groups wheel around the Pole Star, though at times they may be obscured by clouds or haze.

Toward the southeast, the Scorpion can be seen low in the sky. Its brightest star, Antares, which appears reddish, is also known as the "heart of the Scorpion."

In June, although Measure is low in the southwest, the bright summer star groups are well up in the sky and the brighter planets are in prominent positions, providing an interesting assortment of celestial objects to watch during the evening hours.

II. RELIABILITY: Source gave the appearance of an elderly and reliable witness, willing to
answer all questions but was subject to self-delusion. Investigators were unable to
obtain corroborating Source relative. 

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source volunteered the following:
"Also, in the back field, about 2:30 p.m. of July 10th, about 200 yd from the house, a hovering object around 12 or 15 feet off the ground, until Mr. Strout drove his tractor out, then it slowly rose up and maintained a hovering position at a higher altitude. It appeared to be about 25 feet in diameter and a pale blue-green color, and was all one piece with no windows or openings of any kind. It was hovering in the air about 5 minutes,
then suddenly took off at a rapid pace, climbing up and looked the place over, but found no objects there seemed to be any unusual activity of intelligence controlled."

During the interview Source constantly referred to an artist's conception of the July 1956 issue of "COSMOPOLITAN" magazine, and insisted that images on some photographs submitted with the report looked identical to the one shown on the cover of that magazine. Source had kept a scrapbook containing a file of the alleged space men.

Source had kept a kind of "rough log" concerning the sightings and made a considerable show of frequently referring to entries therein.

Includi: Two (2) pieces of charred paper.

II. RELIABILITY OF WITNESS:
In all his statements, had fairly accurate judgement of distances from known objects. Sources were critical of his information given, and was consistently trying to associate the sighting with something in his experience. The information given had the same effect. Source stated that the witness was very cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On August 6, 1958 (ASTIC) SIGHTING NO. 2726), the witness to the following sighting:
Sightings: 
He was looking about Southeast from the front of the house, which is out in the country, when he noticed something bright about 20 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be disc-shaped and was white in color. He then shot back up into the sky about 30 degrees then due to heavy haze, he lost sight of it. He thinks that the object withdrew after being sighted , as it did not reappear. According to his statement, that the fog, and a body of water caused that disappearance. 
SOURCE STATED: That the object at 1910 hours, EDT (Daylight Saving Time) came from a southeast direction at 20 degrees above the horizon. The object was 1/2 the size of the distant moon and was blunt in front and tapered to a point in the rear. It went straight up for approximately 8 seconds, then right and down 1/2-3/4 through traveling time for approximately 8 seconds, then straight and down 1/2-3/4 through traveling time for approximately 8 seconds. Total time of sighting was 10 minutes.
SOURCE STATED THAT THE OBJECT GAVE THE APPEARANCE AS THAT OF A STRONG
FLUORESCENCE, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO THE BEAM OF THE LIGHT. Source further stated the sighting was unusual. The object when first sighted appeared to be much smaller than the distant stars and did not change in size during the sighting, except for a bright star brought to his attention by a 12 year old boy living nearby. Source firmly believes that the object was unusual and has no rational explanation for the sighting.
