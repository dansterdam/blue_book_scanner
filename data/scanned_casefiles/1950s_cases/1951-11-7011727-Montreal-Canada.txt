Montreal, Canada
November 7, 1951
ATTENTION: Blue Book
Subject: Unidentified Flying Object
1. On 7 November 1951 at approximately 1300 hours, the undersigned observed an unidentified object in the sky over Montreal, Canada.

2. The object was oval in shape and silvery in color. It moved at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view in a matter of seconds.

3. The object was observed for a period of 10-15 seconds. It moved from north to south and was observed at an altitude estimated to be approximately 10,000 feet.

4. No sound was heard from the object. Its movement appeared to be smooth and without erratic maneuvers.

5. This report is submitted for your information and evaluation.

UNCLASSIFIED
THE SAUCERS APPEARED
Report on the sighting of an unusual flying object in the sky over Montreal, Canada, on November 7, 1950. The object was observed for about 15 minutes, and its description and behavior are reported.

Part I
On a clear night, at about 11 p.m. of the date above mentioned, the witness was driving on the Laurier and Sherbrooke streets, in the neighborhood of the Montreal Airport. He states that at the intersection of Laurier and Sherbrooke streets, his attention was attracted to a bright light in the sky, at an angle of about 45 degrees above the horizon, and to the west. The light appeared to be stationary at first, but the witness soon observed that it was moving, and at a very high speed. The witness states that the object appeared to be round or elliptical in shape, and that the color varied from white to greenish-white. At the beginning, the object seemed to be at a distance from the witness, but it soon came closer, and passed directly overhead, at a distance estimated by the witness to be about 500 feet. The witness states that, at this time, the object was completely silent, and its size appeared to be that of a medium-sized airplane. As the object passed overhead, the witness observed that it was surrounded by a hazy glow, which seemed to emanate from the object itself. The witness states that, as the object passed overhead, he got the impression that it was about 60 to 70 feet in diameter. After the object had passed overhead, it disappeared in the direction of the west, and the witness states that it seemed to accelerate rapidly as it moved away. The witness states that, after the object had passed overhead, he looked for a few seconds to see if he could observe any unconventional features, such as wings or propellers, but he could not see any such features. The witness states that, during the entire observation, the object maintained a perfectly straight course, and that it did not deviate from its path at any time. The witness states that, after the object had disappeared, he decided to stop his car and observe the sky for a few more minutes, in case the object should reappear, but he did not see it again. The witness states that, during the time the object was visible, he did not observe any conventional aircraft in the sky, either in the vicinity of the object or elsewhere. The witness states that he is a former Army Officer, and that he is thoroughly familiar with the appearance and behavior of conventional aircraft. He states that he is confident that the object he observed was not a conventional aircraft of any kind. The witness states that, during the time the object was visible, there were no other persons in the vicinity who could have observed it, and that he was the only witness to the sighting.

At the very line of vision of the sighting point, tho first appearance of the first object appeared to be about the size of an ordinary star. As it approached closer it increased in size and appeared to be changing shape and color. Its path of motion was weaving or oscillating from side to side as it approached nearer and nearer the observer, it being about the size of the head of a match by the time it passed the zenith overhead. The object appeared to be a glowing, silvery-white in color with a reddish orange hue at times. The motion of the object was at a terrific speed, apparently accelerating at times and then decelerating again as it approached nearer the observer's position. The object was observed through holes in the clouds which rapidly closed in, obscuring the object from further view.

The observational data would have been of considerable value if the observer's positions could have been accurately determined. Since the observers were not trained to give accurate positions, their locations were not precisely determined. The health of the observers' position (c) appeared good and was checked as such, about 1/2 hour after the incident occurred. Calculations of the altitude of the object from (c-2) and (c-3) to point at disappearance (c-1) was imprecise, being based an an estimate only of 4 miles approximate.

The report of this case is based upon an official USAF investigation as detailed by the investigator. He was a trained observer and has had extended experience (5-7) years) in such investigations. His first impressions, of course, is to the best location of the observers' positions he could determine from the data given him. This fell short, however, of the accuracy desirable for a precise computation of altitude and speed.

The investigator reported that the plane was seen clearly (shortly) and the approximate size of the object was estimated at 100 feet in diameter as the plane approached within 2 minutes. The path between (b-1) and (a-1) being a curving flight was not at full speed (estimated 150-200 mph). The first observation was at 11:29 - 5000 = 12:29 plus or minus 2 minutes, the duration being 10-15 seconds. The azimuth was 11 degrees and the elevation was 30 degrees. The last observation was at 12:30 or 12:31.

It was reported that the observers were highly reliable and their characters were beyond reproach. The investigator stated that the sightings were not the result of any illusions or hallucinations, and that the object was observed by several competent and well-qualified observers.

UNCLASSIFIED
From the intelligence division of the air technical intelligence center technical information letter no. 4-51 this item appears to give details or drawing of an unknown object or phenomenon.
The final stage of triangulation involved the angle of vision at the two observation points, as shown on the enclosed diagram. 
The angle of vision subtends the two points of observation, determining the range of the object.
The calculations determined the object to be 1,530-2' long - while the visual appearance of the phenomenon suggested that the object is a reasonable velocity, which is 115 m.p.h. at an altitude of 2,000 feet.
The field triangulation was made with the help of [REDACTED].
