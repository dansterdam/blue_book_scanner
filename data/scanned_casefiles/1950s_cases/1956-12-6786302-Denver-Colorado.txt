No Case (Information Only)                                   31 December 1956
                                                        Washington Heights, N.Y.C.

December 31, 1956, [redacted], who lives in Washington Heights, N.Y.C., noticed an exceptionally bright light from his 8th floor window at 11:35 p.m. Busy at the moment, he paid little attention until the intense brightness made him look out the window, which faces north and commands an unobstructed view of the Hudson River. The object was spherical, with a faint tinge of green; its edge was sharply defined. At the near was a tail-like projection, including slightly upward. This "handle" was as long as the diameter of the main object, and about half as thick. The entire object, including "handle", was as large as the full moon, and far more brilliant; its brightness lit up the river beneath it. It left no trail. The "handle" definitely seemed to be part of the object.

When first seen, the object appeared to be directly over the river, north of the George Washington Bridge, traveling westward at about twice the speed of an airliner as it passes over the same area at a normal altitude. Its elevation was estimated at 300 to 100, and its impression was that its altitude above the river was only about 1000 feet. When the object reached a point about 200 above the Jersey Palisades, it paused until, "like the closing of a camera diaphragm," [redacted] is sure it did not disappear at high speed into the distance, but simply shrank and went out." About 10 seconds elapsed from the moment the light was noticed through the window until the object finally disappeared.

The object itself was under good observation for about four seconds. No other aircraft in the area; no noise heard; as yet, no confirmatory reports.

The resemblance to the [redacted] object will be noted.

No Case (Information Only)                                   2 December 1956
                                                    San Luis Obispo, California

Case 278, San Luis Obispo, Cal, Dec. 2, 1956—Reported the San Diego Union, "Five mysterious lights were seen in the sky. One observer said they were too bright to be stars. Three policemen and a newspaper reporter watched the lights for 45 minutes and a newspaper reporter having a pulsing red glow, then changing to blue and finally to white."

San Luis Obispo made news in November when it was selected as the site for Morr-Ka the Martian to contact earthlings from his saucer. Saucerians claim that saucers did appear over San Luis Obispo on the designated date, but authorities countenanced their claim with silence. However, the incident was so well known that never took place—and the affair was tagged a hoax by most civilian researchers. With so much emphasis put on San Luis Obispo, it seems in line that other sightings, such as the one of Dec. 2, should take place and be published.

Case 277, Baltimore, MD, Dec 3, 1956—Quoting the Baltimore Sun, "Two men reported they saw a flying object streak away from a large transport plane while they were standing at Charles and Centre Streets. Curvin Bush and Robert Bryant, guards at the Walters Art Gallery, said, "We thought at first the tail or a section of a wing had broken loose. But then the plane reversed its direction from northeast to southwest to follow the thing." They said the object was "flat, oval-shaped and very bright." It appeared to be spinning counterclockwise. They said they watched it until it disappeared behind a building..."

Case 279, Stow, Ohio, Dec. 4, 1956—Investigator Herbert Clark, now residing in Akron procured the following report for CRIFO, but did not get permission to use the sighter's name. Writes Clark: "Time, 11:55 p.m. Sighter... former Marine sergeant. Sighter, looked over Slighter... saw reddish object, flying much faster than a jet—head, saw reddish object, flying NE, very high, no sound. Object appeared as a flying NE, very high, no sound. Object appeared to two second intervals, came out at 90° from first object. This would make them flying to the NNW. Disappeared quickly. Main object remained on course until it disappeared from view. Entire incident, according to sighter, occurred in approx. 6 to 8 seconds." Comments Clark, "From what I could gather in the conversation, the witness seemed reliable. However, I have to wonder about the time sequence."

Case: 280, Patrick AFB, Florida, Dec. 11, 1956—
Writes a correspondent whose name we will not use.

Today . . . a rocket was fired and it went quite away
upstairs. On the return flight a jet was covering the
photos, and out from behind the rear bounced two saucer
type ships at 25,000 feet. Through 7 x 50 glasses they
were bright and gleaming—as the sun on a bright day.
One was 400 feet to the rear and the other farther back
and both traveling at 4500 or faster speeds . . .
CRIFO's correspondent goes on to tell of the objects
making a 90° turn—and the jet trying to turn with them,
but without luck. He commented, "The machines left him
(the jet) holding his hand."
