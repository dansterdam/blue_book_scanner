AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Individual Flying Object Report (Item)

2/te R.O. Summary 14 May 1954 SOURCE Captain Kenneth J. Scott Jr.

Forwarded by Captain Scott westward to unidentified object by T.O.T.
(Incident). Incident high speed, unmaneuveerable white or silver plate
well at some length, altitude 50,000 to 60,000 ft. Object made a 150 degree
turn and in subsequent track did chase and attempt to close with a plane
present speed led observer to consider the maneuver improbable for conventional
aircraft.

EVALUATION OF EPISODE:

Captain Scott is an experienced pilot and flight commander with 3000 hours
flying time of which over 1100 hours is jet time. Considers his observation
very credible. Lt's Bacon and Charly, both wing, G14 and have been pilots
with more than 30 seconds and made no concrete identification as excepting the
fact there was no resemblance to conventional aircraft.

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:

Interview of radar operator revealed nothing conclusive since estimated
altitude of object (3bo feet, improved) and fact that at 13 was climbing one of radar
scopes above 50,000 ft. Other advisors in area at 35,000 to 40,000 ft were RAF
personnel. Incident was above 50,000 ft. Home was in 14 miles range of observation
observation source considered reliable. No explanation of the possible cause of
the sighting.
