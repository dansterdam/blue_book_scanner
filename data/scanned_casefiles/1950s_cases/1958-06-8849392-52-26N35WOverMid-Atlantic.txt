Here is the text from the document:

27 Jun     0217 = Not just into 7 -

The following was extracted from the Staff Duty Officer's Report
dated 27-28 Jun 58:

2245-Major Carmody, Operations Officer, at the Air Force Command
Post called to relay a NORAD report passed on by the 6th Air Division.
MACON-GOT night pilot reported seeing an object going South-Southeast,
1/5 size of the moon breaking apart at high speeds and with a bright
lightning, sighting at 52° 26' N and 35° W. Time of sighting 0217 Zulu.
Major Carmody said a UFO report will follow.

Staff Duty Officer was 2/Lt U S Miller

Notes: 1. Poss. report
         2. Bright light
         3. Zulu time

1. Very little info. + data - only brief and
   brief description
2.   Appears typical of material - not "lacking of"
3.   Insufficient data to evaluate or follow
     total conclusions, attempt "picked" is indicated

Held until a full report or more detailed
are submitted - too sketchy
