---
When the searchlight was lit again, the ball was still there.

Curious onlookers crowded around the searchlight; they also saw the “ball
of the Christmas tree”. They saw it up to the moment when (around 2300 hours)
the crew gave up, and decided to extinguish the searchlight. However, they
were not the only ones who saw it; the next morning, inhabitants of the suburbs
of Sablon and Queuleu, had to confirm the appearance of the phenomenon.

But, the radar apparatus, which had scanned the skies without interruption,
did not record anything.

”This 'thing'," explained one of the technicians, is non-metallic and, there-
fore, not detectable by radar.

The day-before-yesterday, the Metz Fair, which had been visited by more
than 600,000 visitors, closed its doors: no more searchlight, no more radar,
no more mysterious spheres. Nothing is left, but the testimony of a dozen
people; the searchlight operators, an officer of the Geographic Service of the
Army, and Commander Cottel, who’s report is impatiently awaited in the mansion
of the military governor. The curiosity, which can be well imagined, will make
the flying saucers an historic event.

Three little Beings in an Electric Saucer

Nevers, October 13

Two merchants of Clamecy, Mr, Louis Vigneron and Henri Gallois, who were
on their way to the fair at Corbigny, noticed, yesterday morning around six-
o’clock, from their little truck, a craft of cylindrical form and of a fairly
large diameter, appearing at a distance of approximately 50 meters.

At the same instant, the engine of the truck stopped and the headlights
went out.

Mr. Gallois stated: "It took away my breath! My body was struck by a sort
of electrical discharge. I could very distinctly make out a craft which looked
like a saucer.

I noticed three beings of small stature and of seemingly bizarre shape
moving around the craft. We sat as if immobilized inside of the little truck
unable to move. Only after the craft had flown away with incredible rapidity,
could we continue on our way."

Mr. Vigneron confirmed these statements of his companion, and so did
a third witness, Mr. Henri Chanez, who is a carriage maker at Le Carrie in
the community of Claracey.

Car Stopped by the Passage of a Reddish Ball

Saint-Etienne, 12 October

Two people from Gueugnon, namely Messars Jeannet and Garnier, who were on
their way home in their automobile last Sunday night, witnessed an inexplicable
phenomenon:

Suddenly their vehicle was overflown by a sort of reddish ball which passed
by like a flash. The engine of the car stopped and all the lights of the car
went out. A few instants later, when the luminous apparition reached the
horizon, the headlights of the car functioned again, and the engine purred again.

A giant rocket taking off from a field, has been seen by Mr. Pierre Vidal,
cook, living at Croix-Daurade, near Toulouse, and by his nephew, Angel Hurle.
The phenomenon disappeared in a luminous orange and pale-green light. At the
spot where the rocket had presumably stopped, the grass was covered with a
fatty vapor, smelling of petroleum.

Mr. M. Boy, a professor of mathematics, from Lusieny, discovered, over the
Saint-Germain-le-Livet woods, a silvery disc of seven or eight meters diameter
which rose quietly into the sky while turning around its own axle. After it
dived toward the ground from an altitude of approximately 600 meters, it took
off in a horizontal direction in a sort of dizzy attitude.

A "special advisory group", namely, the owner of a cafe, a rugby player, and
a champion swimmer, have also seen, above the chapel of Brouilly in the direction
of Montgelas in the department of Rhone, a flying saucer, moving like a ball used
for playing.

A bell-shaped object, three meter high, moving in bands of 12 meters in
an orange gleam and emitting sparks of greenish light, was observed for an hour,
on the railroad tracks from Svreux to Laviers, by an artist, his apprentices
and an agricultural worker.

A luminous mushroom, which moved rapidly and noiselessly, has been seen
Monday night at half-past 2300 hours, by Mres. Drouillard, at La Roche-sur-Yon.

A "flying cigar" of metallic appearance, from which three red-balls became
detached, has been seen by Mr. Roger Thevenin and Albert Daury, police officers
of the city force at Riom (Puy-de-Dôme).

Another "cigar", surrounded by an irridescent gleam, has been observed at
Bonpas in the oriental Pyrenees Mountains. It was discovered by Mr. Sebille,
a baker.

A craft of oblong shape, described big figure S's in the sky, and making
a noise like pressurized vapor, has been spotted by three young hunters over
the city of Gaillac (Aveyron). The same craft is alleged to have been observed
at Pont-de-Salars.

NEW UFO'S DESCRIBED AS 'SOUP TUREENS'

Paris, AFP, Radioteletype in French to the Americas, Oct. 7, 1954, 0439 GMT--:

(Text)

Paris--The appearance of mysterious objects, varying now from the classical "saucers" to "cigars" and "soup-tureens," is continuing in France's skies.

A Dordogne farmer saw "Martians" again yesterday. According to him, they were two normal men, of European type, dressed in khaki overalls. They came down from an object which had landed in the vicinity, approached the farmer and shook his hand, asking him: "Paris-Nord?" "Avew by stupidaction, the farmer was unable to answer. The two strangers stroked his dog and boarded their engine. They lighted up some kind of electrical lighting," and the apparatus flew away rapidly and noiselessly, without smoke or sparks, at a dizzy speed. Owing to fog and semi-darkness, the witness was unable to observe exactly, and gave the following description: "The object had the trunk of a big cart, and the front of an oval copper-tureen streamlined to the front."

Three inhabitants saw a luminous globe which seemed to swing at about 50 centimeters from the ground. The globe turned red and then blue and flew up vertically and rapidly. A similar globe was seen near La Rochelle.

In the Biarritz area, several persons have seen at different hours mysterious round and oval objects, which were leaving luminous trails in the sky.

On the golden coast, a young woman asserted that she saw an unknown object sending forth an orange light, landing near her house. Alerted neighbors ascertained later that earth lumps had been thrown around within a radius of 1½ meters at the place where the object had landed.

An Isere farmer saw a "Huge flying orange section." He said that its top was luminous and a little later I saw it divide along its length into three smaller sections, which gradually disappeared."

An inhabitant of Lower Seine saw an object "in the form of a luminous bundle, which changed into a ball before disappearing."

Finally, an engineer of Seine and Marne sent a letter to a local newspaper, stating that he had seen "a big disc, from 8 to 10 meters in diameter, which was rotating on a certain spot, while sending out red and purple lights. The object was about 500 meters in height and gliding over me for more than 20 minutes."

PRESS WEIGHS MOLOTOV'S BERLIN SPEECH

Paris, French Home Service, Oct. 8, 1954), 0700 GM--L

(Press Review on Molotov's Berlin Speech)

(Excerpts)

RESISTANCES DE L'OUEST says "Molotov has made, as was expected, a last
minute attempt to prevent the strengthening of western Europe. His
attempt is belittling place just as the French parliament debates the
London agreements. This coincidence throws a blinding light on Soviet aims."

LE PROGRES DE LYON  says: "Molotov wishes to strengthen Soviet links with
East Germany and to keep the door open for new negotiations." L'HUMANITE
says: "It is of course obvious that everything is not new in the Soviet
proposals. But one cannot seriously accuse a diplomacy of remaining faithful
to its principles when the latter are those of peaceful coexistence and
of negotiations. The fact that such principles are reaffirmed does not
weaken them."

LES ECHOS says: "Molotov's offers are vague and unreliable. His willingness
to resume negotiations does not mean that he has given up the demands which
led to the failure of previous negotiations. The preliminary conditions
laid down by the USSR remain today as unacceptable as they were yesterday."

LORD-SCAR says: "The duty of the Western Powers is to be prepared for
the worst. That does not prevent them from backing the 'best' if the
latter occurs."

LE POPULAIRE says: "One must continue to negotiate. But at the same
time one must also put the finishing touch to the defensive organization
of the free world. Events have shown that Soviet concessions are in ration
to firmness, organization, and solidarity of the West."

Robert Schuman writing in LE COURRIER DE LA SEINE says: "Constructive
cooperation between the East and the West is at present impossible
because of differences in the very views held by the two sides concern-
ing the role of man. All we can hope for and try to achieve is the
establishment of a modus vivendi between the two world with economic
and possibly cultural exchanges. This presupposing the relaxation of
controls and the lowering of present barriers."

Midget 'Beings' in 'Thing' 

Farris, AFP, Radioteletype in English to the Americacs, Oct. 7, 1954, 1400 GMT--:

(Text)

Chauvont--A road worker near here reported today having seen one of the occupants of a "flying saucer" dressed in a "hair-covered cloak."

Andre Marcy, 48, of Merteu, Haute-Marne, sa-.-d he was walking along a road yesterday morning when he saw an orange-colored "thing" which he at first took to be a tree whose leaves were turning for the fall. As he approached, Marcy said he saw next to the "thing" a small 'being,' less than 4 feet 'tall, dressed in tire coat. Marcy said that when he called, the 'being' turned and entered the "machine" which rose vertically in the air.

Marcy said the machine was spherical in form, and about 30 feet in diameter. Underneath the machine was a sort of spindle, Marcy said, and between the spindle and the body of the machine was a "port hole" by which the "being" entered. A flame shot from the spindle as the machine took off, Marcy said. Marcy said he told his fellow workmen about the incident, and two of them returned with him to the site. All three said they found that the grass had turned slightly milk-colored, ar.d there were round imprints of small legs where the machine had stood.

FOREIGN SIGHTINGS                                   7 Dec 54

France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Switzerland

Report No. ATIC 201592 (IR-271-54) dated 27 October contains
various comments extracted from newspapers throughout Europe on
various UFO sightings. Descriptions include:

Flying cigars
Flying saucers
Translucent ellipses
Balls of fire
Illuminous fish trays
Immense greenish cigar

COMMENTS: ATIC attributed two major causes of the recent (Sep, Oct,
Nov 54) outbreak of sightings in Europe. Mr. Keyhoe's book
has recently been translated into various languages and is now
selling in Europe. Also, a current increase of meteoric activity
might account for a portion of the observations.

Article from French newspaper La Croix du Nord (North Star)

Types of Flying Saucers

Mimes, France

Several hunters in the community of Saint-Ambroix (Department of Gard), are
alleged to have recently seen seven very-small beings whose shape suggested
vaguely that of a human body. When the hunters attempted to approach them,
these beings precipitated themselves upon a phosphorescent craft which
immediately took off.

At the place where these flying saucer pilots had been, the hunters
discovered, on the ground, a number of grains of a queer appearance: they
had these grains examined by experts who found it impossible to identify them
among any group of grain-types known to science.

A Diver with Enormous Eyes

Toulouse

A diver of small stature with a large head in comparison to his body, and
two enormous eyes, was described Wednesday night by Mr. Olivver, an inhabitant
of Toulouse. This mysterious pilot alighted from a spherical craft which
landed at 1935 hours on an "undefined territory".

Mr. Olivver, owner of the Javel Neto establishment at Toulouse, was
accompanied by an employee, Mr. Perano and by a young boy of about 15 years
of age. All three of them saw the luminous craft land and noticed that it
was of spherical shape and of a reddish color, and also some people approaching

then, One of them, the "diver", sparkled like glass, according to the
witnesses.

Mr. Olivier, a veteran aviation pilot, drew this diver on a door in a
very impressive manner. Mr. Perano added, "I didn't believe it, but I
saw him just as well as I see you. That gave me a damn shock,"

After a short while, approximately one minute, the "diver" reached
the luminous sphere which took him away in a vertical ascent without noise, and disappeared in the sky at a terrific speed, leaving a streak of fire.

Due to darkness, the investigation could not be undertaken until
Thursday morning. Oily traces have been found at various spots at the "unidentified area".

One of the witnesses alleged that the flying saucer was surrounded by
irridescent reflections and emitted around itself a slight fog. He added that when he tried to approach, he was held back at a distance of approximately 20 meters by a paralyzing force, and was violently thrown to the ground when the craft had risen into the sky.

"The time was about 4:00 P. M. and the sky was very clear viewed with streaks or layers of clouds, with blue sky between.

It was very large and tripped the places, not everything was a known airplane, and as it was very interesting...I had seen only a few hundred feet above the ground, but was over 300 ft., it did not seem more than that, it was moving normally, very much in the normal size to match more than indicated half believed to...away...so near, and then I could not see any wings or tail or fuselage generally, it seemed to be a large disc or long-shaped object, and in comparison with the objects below I estimated it to be perhaps 75 or 100 feet at least, in size.
