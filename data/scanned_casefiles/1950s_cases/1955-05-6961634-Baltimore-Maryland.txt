Subject: Unidentified Object

1. Captain FATAL (Assistant Chief, BLUE): Forwarded enclosed information concerning an unidentified object sighted by a civilian witness on 17 May 1955 at Baltimore, Maryland.

Police Saturday, 1630 hours, reported an unidentified object was sighted by a uniformed police officer near the Police Station. Here the object was sighted visually and was described in details.

The object appeared to be composed of gray-like metallic material, very close to the ground, perhaps 100 to 200 feet in diameter, rounded, with approximate 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 feet high. The object was stationary in the one end) was similar in the place, and 1500 hours the second place had quite obviously been a large "egg" shaped object.

Note caused by the sailing action or any other action which could be definitely stated at 1/4 pounds. The object was not moving.

The Baltimore NEWS POST, the local newspaper, was called and people were called that might have seen the object flying through the air or falling. No other information was obtained.

The Police Captain, FRANK J. RYAN, was interviewed and gave the following information...

Newspaper Article Taken from the Baltimore Sun:

WEIRD, SHINY METAL DROPS FOUND

Piece that Crashed Through Roof is Oil Firm's Puzzle

(The rest of the first paragraph is partially illegible)

The police, cold metal about two inches in diameter and a ridge long, crashed through the roof of a home on the first floor.

What it is and where it came from have not been established.

Shows Chunk

The complaint came yesterday from North Y. Spears of the 800 Block Russell Street.

He showed the chunk of mysterious metal to police in the Southern district and left them puzzled as he was. The piece is curved and grooved and hollow.

Inclosure 4 to Part Two
Newspaper Article Taken from the Baltimore News-Post, Tuesday, May 10, 1955

Maybe they are parts of a flying machine, police speculated today as they examined two pieces of metal found near the Southern High School at Erdman Avenue and Russell Street.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer the object was not likely accidentally dropped inside an aircraft, civilian or military or private.

2. At the National Air Report, Baltimore, Maryland Air Base Flight Service, no similar sightings were reported.

3. At the time, it could easily have been a small private aircraft.

4. Although the seriousness of the incident is noted, the weight of the evidence does not appear to be conclusive.

5. The velocity of the object (3 x 4 least) and the fact that the object came from the floor and spiraled to the floor, indicates the metal came from the floor.

6. The fact that Mr. SCHUESSLER heard an aircraft having landed prior to this incident.

7. All persons contacted, including Mr. SCHUESSLER and the police, believe the incident is explainable.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting was released or falls into an aircraft flying over or in the vicinity.

II. RELIABILITY: Mr. [redacted] is a serious, intelligent individual who holds a responsible position with a large corporation. His statements and observations can be considered valid and true.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: At 7/1302d May 55 SOURCE was having lunch in his office. Since it was Saturday afternoon, the other employees were not in the office. While eating lunch, he heard a loud noise in the rear of the plant. Running to the rear he discovered that two pieces of metal had crashed through the roof, apparently falling to a 2 1/2 ft. area on the floor. Looking through the hole in the roof, SOURCE heard the receding noise of an aircraft. Although he could not see the aircraft, SOURCE believed that he had been oversees at the time of the noise and was now departing. The objects appeared to be made of cast iron or similar metal and have no visible markings. Each joined as one piece weighing approximately 13 3/4 pounds, rounded with approximately a 2 to 2 1/2 inch diameter. The second piece approximately 5 1/4 pounds together with the first piece appeared to be a single casting. SOURCE estimated to a layman's cover or wheel. It is estimated that the entire "wheel" if found would weigh about 30 pounds.

SOURCE contacted Baltimore police on 7 May 55 and again on 9 May 55. On 9 May 55 Baltimore police picked up the two objects and called 412 Research and Developmental Command who made a preliminary investigation and then contacted this organization. Reports made by police and Air Research and Development Command are contained in PART TWO of this report.

3. Captain FRANK DEMS, Southern District, Baltimore, Maryland City Police received the first report (see ENCLOSURE #1) through the radio news. He was also explosion reported an incident in the district which would have resulted in a loss of machinery being mutually through the air. Further, the object, although bearing a faint resemblance to a manhole cover, is completely different from any manhole cover in Baltimore. Also there was no proof of any apprehension in Baltimore.

4. Captain RYAN, Air Research and Development Command, made the preliminary investigation (see ENCLOSURE #2).

MEMO FOR RECORD:                                                   10 May 1955

SUBJECT: Unidentified Object

1. Captain RYAN, Assistant Chief, ATIC/CP, received a phone call from Captain
K. R. GRIDE, ADPS (Ext 89), at approximately 1600 hours, 9 May 1955, who related the
information contained in attached memo for Record, dtd 9 May 1955, subject "Objects
Falling Through Roof of Building-ADPS".

2. At approximately 1630 hours, Captain RYAN departed for the Southern District
Police Station, after contacting Mr. KAHN, Washington, the details. Captain KAHN
was met by a uniformed policeman and escorted to the Police Captain's office where,
the objects were viewed, and are described as follows:

The objects appeared to be composed of cast iron or similar materials, and
the two (2) pieces gave evidence of a one time bending, being "perhaps near or
very close to the apparent point of break". The one piece weighed approximately 13 3/4
pounds, rounded, with approximately a 2 to 2 1/2 inch diameter; measured along the
periphery, its length was about 20 inches; a hole (cut in the center by the break on
the one end) was sunken in the piece and might have measured about (4) inch in diameter; the depth of the hole was about one (1) to one and one quarter (1-1 1/4) inches.
The second piece had more obviously been joined to the first, and if joined, would
resemble a ragged "piece of pie"; the point of obvious juncture was bright, as metal
will become when slightly broken. This second piece was flat, about one quarter inch
(1/4) to three eight inch (3/8) thick, was pinned by a hole about one (1) inch in
diameter wide appearing to have been a part of the original design at the object and
not caused by the falling action or any other action weighing about 3 to 4 pounds,
estimated at 5 1/4 pounds; the two "middle" of the entire piece, if joined as "a piece
of pie", would have about 9 inches and 12 inches. If the pieces had been near or a similar piece and the whole had been constructed as the pieces, the object's diameter
would have been about 20 inches, its weight, about 30 pounds.

3. A newspaper reporter (Mr. [illegible]) and photographer (name unknown) from
the Baltimore News Post newspaper requested a picture of the objects with Captain
RYAN. The latter recalled, "The newspaper people were with Captain HARRIS investigating some part of the routine Air Force investigation of matters concerning objects
flying through the air or falling from the air, and that any official Air Force statement would be issued by the Department of the Air Force, Washington, D. C." Then
asked if a "follow up" might be made here, it was recommended they contact the PIO
officer at Headquarters, ADC, for further release.

4. The Police Captain, [illegible] then stated he would make an investigation
of the building and the surrounding area concerned in this report, and relay the results of his investigation to Captain KAHN on the morning of 10 May 1955. This was
accomplished. A summary of the Police Captain's findings is given as follows:

Investigation disclosed the two pieces of material already described had
pierced the roof of the American Oil Company Building at the time and under the circumstances described in a copy of the Police Report of the Police Department, City of

1. The two objects, which accompanied the report, were closely examined by
both ATIC personnel and several metallurgists from Iron Foundry and casting companies in Dayton, Ohio. Following is the result of the analysis:

a. Characteristics of the objects

(1) The two objects, weighing 13 3/4 and 5 1/4 lbs are definitely
of a good quality cast iron containing less than 2% silicon in composition.

(2) From close examination it was found that the casting is of an old
variety and traces of corrosion indicate it had been installed near water or in
some other moist location.

(3) The objects are PROBABLY from a former valve control wheel used on
ocean vessels, steam regulating apparatus and/or water and sewerage systems.

(4) The hole located at the break on the pipe-like piece was found
to contain a considerable amount corrosion, suggesting that a former "handles-type"
assembly was once installed there.

b. Probable cause of the incident - It is very difficult to determine what
caused the incident; however, after consideration of various possibilities, the
following conclusions were attained:

(1) It is very unlikely that any aircraft in the area at the time
could have dropped the particular pieces recovered. If the whole "wheel" had been
accidentally dropped from an aircraft, it would have remained in one place until

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency)                    REPORT NO.
Flight 3-4, 4602d AISS          3-14-USAF-55-55         Part Two   PAGE  6   OF   9   PAGES

Incident: Rutledge, Condy, May 1955, (attached as INCLOSURE 4). He further
stated that the piece(s) had penetrated the car roof of the building, as well as the
wind-proof and sound proofing material (unscorched thickness and material), had struck
an invisible pillar inside the car causing the car to stop and the building, finally
falling to the floor. There were no injuries to personnel reported.

The building is estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 ft in height and
is located just off the Baltimore-Washington Expressway in the 3500 block of Russell
Street. The Police Captain reported there were no cranes or other equipment within
a reasonable distance of the building (thinking perhaps the objects might have been
part of such an apparatus), nor were there any other places or equipment at a nearby
to indicate the possibility of a part of the had become detached and have fallen or have
been impelled through the roof. He stated the building has no approximate 120 feet
front and the side/s fall about 30 feet from the one end, 60 feet from the front, 30
feet from the South side.

5. Captain HANSON, Commander 4602nd AISS was called on the morning of 10 May
1955 and the pertinent facts related to him. (Raymond A2100, Ext 2103) (Michels Air
Force Base), he called Captain RYAN back to inform him he (HANSON) was coming
to Baltimore and should arrive in the late afternoon. (10 May 1955). It was stated
to him the Captain in charge of the Southern District Police would be called, as interviewing Captain RYAN, who was in the local area.

6. Captain RYAN called Captain F. A. DEMS, Southern District Police Station at
1035 hours, 10 May 1955, and stated the regular investigative officer would like to
make a call for the purpose of continuing and completing the necessary investigation,
pending an approximate 1600 hours, 10 May 1955. In the call Captain DEMS advised
Captain if he thought it possible the personnel involved at the American Oil Company
might be interviewed. I proceeded as Administrative Annex to this. On taking about
interviewing the two Police Officers who made the call the Police Captain seemed reluctant to have these men interviewed, stating all that they could say had already been
included in the report. Captain RYAN thanked the Captain for his cooperation and
stated that he, as well as the Investigative officer would call at about 1600 hours or
shortly thereafter.

7. Upon arrival of Captain HANSON, this memo, as well as other pertinent materials will be turned over to him for completion of the investigation. (Captain
RYAN, P10, AISS, was notified of the action to this point.)

He stated that some objects had fallen through the roof of an American Oil Company Building, located on Pennington Avenue.

The objects appeared to be of cast metal of following dimensions:
one item - approx 12" long x 2 inches in diameter.
one item - triangular shaped, approximately 1/4" thick, by 6" x 6" x 5".

Notified Capt RYAN, ADTOIP, ext 352, at 1310.

Newspaper Article Taken From the Baltimore Sun:

WHERE DID METAL BAR DROP FROM:

Pipe That Crashed Through Roof Is Oil Plant Puzzle

A twenty-pound metal bar had the police stumped last night.

The pipe, solid metal about two inches in diameter and 14 inches long, crashed through the roof and second floor of an oil plant office Saturday and came to rest on the first floor.

What it is and where it came from have not been established.

Shows Chunk

The complaint came yesterday from Joseph A. Ames, of the 300 block of Paradise Avenue, who is manager of the American Oil Company office in the 1500 block of Russell Street.

He showed the chunk of mysterious metal to police in the Southern district, and it left them as puzzled as he was. The pipe is curved and grayish and heavy as lead.

A sergeant examined it and could give only this explanation: "Part of a flying saucer."

Enclosure 4 to Part Two
Newspaper Article Taken From the Baltimore News-Post, Tuesday, May 10, 1955:

PARTS OF FLYING SAUCERY
Mystery Metal Pieces Pierce Roof of Plant

Maybe they are parts of a flying saucer, police speculated today as they continued to study two heavy pieces of metal which, evidently falling from a very considerable height, pierced through the roof of the American Oil Company plant in the 1500 block Russell Street.

The inquest asked Capt. Frank A. Deans of the Southern district station, "We're calling in experts to look at 'em, but the investigation is not doing much good."

Highlighting about 2:00 p.m. the hunt of metal plunged through the roof of the offices in the 1500 block Russell Street Saturday afternoon and scared several workers.

One piece is about two inches in diameter and curved. The second is a quarter inch thick with a round hole in the center.

"Investigator" said it looked like the two should fit together but they couldn't make them fit.

An Air Force expert was called in and concluded that, "They're metal, I know that much," is said they didn't appear to be from any type of airplane he has seen.

Incidentally there was no explanation in that area which might have hurled the chunks into the oil company offices on Saturday, police still went on the theory that the metal pieces came from the sky.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Originator)                REPORT NO.                Part Three    PAGE 9 OF 9 PAGES
Flight 3-H, 4602d AISS           3H-UFOB-5-55

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the object was probably accidentally dropped from an aircraft, either military or private, for the following reasons:

a. Although a check with Base Operations at Friendship International Airport, Baltimore, Maryland and the Flight-Service Center at United Air Force Base, Pennsylvania disclosed no aircraft in the area at the time, it could easily have been a small private aircraft or military aircraft flying locally.

b. Although the heaviness of the metal precludes it being used as part of an aircraft it could have been part of a cargo.

c. The velocity of the objects (penetrating the roof, second and third floor) at 2 X 4 beam) and the fact the objects came directly through the roof to the floor below indicates the metal came from great height. If the metal had come from a neighboring plant or sewer explosion, the metal would have entered the building in a more lateral direction.

d. The fact that Mr. [REDACTED] heard an aircraft leaving the area at the time of the incident helps confirm this theory.

2. All persons contacted, including Mr. [REDACTED] and the police, believe the metal came from an overhead aircraft.

contacted with the roof of the building. There were no other places could be spotted.

(2) A researcher would have to possess a great amount of physical strength to have thrown the objects up with the roof.

(3) If the objects had been part of a revolving mechanism or a swirling motion, they would have entered the building in a more lateral direction. (Unless in the case of a vortex.)

(4) The most possible explanation attained was that the phenomenon is more a loose swirling mass that was necessary, conducting "swirl-tracking" operations on that day caused the object to be "swirled-taken" into the air and carried through the roof of the building. Several of the persons with experience in this type of operation substantiated this theory and stated they had seen pieces of metal widely shaken at a distance of about one mile.

2. Upon the tentative conclusion made in paragraph (4) above, a call was made to the reporting officer who was requested to check local conclusions quickly. A negative reply was received stating that the two recent back yards were not conducting "swirl-tracking" operations on that day. Regardless of this negative reply, it is felt that this is the only logical explanation and that the work personnel (some of them) might have been hesitant in admitting such operations due to the legal aspects involved.

               4602d AISS, McGuire AFB, New Jersey

NARRATIVE-    1100 hrs, 16 May 1955 - AFCILNS received the above mentioned report,
               with air mail from Ft Pit, 4602d ADS Mcguire AFB, New Jersey
               with two metallic objects as inclosures. The undersigned airman
               was assigned the task of interviewing several persons from Iron &
               Steel Companies in Dayton, Ohio in an attempt to identify the two
               objects.

INTERVIEWS ACCOMPLISHED -

               1. 1400 hrs, 16 May 1955 - Visited the Dayton Forging Nicest Treating
               Company and discussed the objects with Mr. [redacted]. Mr. [redacted]
               stated that the objects were definitely a fairly good quality of cast iron, after conducting
               some routine tests ( a spark test and magnetic observations).
               He further indicated that in his [redacted] opinion, the two
               pieces were, at one time, joined and were initially part of a balance
               wheel or valve control wheel. Mr. [redacted] also pointed out that in
               his estimation, the pieces were NOT [redacted] type of flywheel drive
               to apparent construction and the evident outer rim smoothness of the
               pipe-like piece. He examined that the smooth area indicated constant
               ware from contact with either human hands or some soft material.

               A true evaluation of Mr. [redacted] reliability and character could
               not be obtained due to the relatively short time of the interview.
               However, he impressed the reporting airman with his direct answers to
               all questions, (his answers contained no contradictory statements),
               and his enthusiasm in extending assistance. It was obvious that Mr.
               [redacted] was well educated and versed in the field of metallurgy.

               2. 1155 hrs, 16 May 1955 - Discussed the objects in question with
               Mr. [redacted] of the Kopelove Iron & Metal Company, Dayton, Ohio.
               Mr. [redacted] (unaware of my visit to the company in [redacted]) a
               readily answered all questions asked of him. Mr. [redacted] statements
               and conclusions varied very little from those obtained at the first
               interview with Mr. [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] is the [redacted] with the
               company.

1520 hrs, 16 May 1955 - Visited the [redacted] Dayton, Ohio. The reporting airman was introduced to [redacted] who is next owner of the laboratories. Lt. [redacted] stated that during his experience in both the productive and research aspects of the field of metallurgy, he had observed many "wheels" formed similarly to which the shape of two objects in this case. He further indicated that the objects were undoubtedly part of a turn wheel installed on valves of various designs. Apparatus which commonly utilize this type of a wheel include control valves in vapor and sewerage systems, steam regulating assemblies and quite frequently found on ocean vessels. Moreover, Lt. [redacted] stated that pieces were from an old type of wheel made years ago, and this similar control devices of today are usually lighter in weight and advanced in design. He then confirmed the composition of the material as being cast iron, of fair good quality with an estimation of less than 27 silicon in material content.

Lt. [redacted] also advanced the theory that the objects in question crashed through the building in Baltimore as a result of "skull-cracking" operations probably being conducted at a local scrap yard within a radius of a mile of the site of the incident. He explained that during his experience he had seen many metallic pieces fly through the sky as a result of "skull-cracking".

Lt. [redacted] appeared to be a very well educated gentleman, as well as having the practical background experience which enabled him to express himself fluently and thoroughly when asked specific questions by this interviewer.

4. 1555 hrs, 16 May 1955 - Phoned in above information to Capt. Hardin, Project Monitor.

CONCLUSION

1. After reviewing the aforementioned statements and opinions together with the report, it is felt by this investigator that the incident can be summed up as follows:

A. Characteristics of the Objects

(1). The two objects, weighing 12 3/4 and 5 1/4 lbs, are definitely a good quality cast iron.

(2). From close examination it was found that the casting is of an old variety and traces of corrosion indicate it had been installed near water or in some other humid location.

(3). The objects are probably from a former valve control wheel.

(4). The hole located at the break on the pipe-like piece was found to contain a considerable amount of corrosion, suggesting that a former "handle-type" assembly was once installed there.

Years ago it was the practice of men operating this type of apparatus to remove such handles to lessen the possibility of personal injury.

B. Probable Cause of the Incident

(1). It is extremely unlikely that any aircraft flying in the area at the time could have dropped these particular pieces. If the whole wheel had been accidentally dropped from an aircraft, it would have remained in one piece until contact with the roof of the building. There were no other pieces "and or noted".

(2). A prankster would have to possess a great amount of physical strength to have thrown it up and through the roof.

(3). If the objects had been part of a revolving mechanism of a passing train, they would have entered the building in a more lateral direction, rather than the obvious vertical direction they fell in.

(4). Based upon close examination of the report and as a result of the interviews conducted, it is felt by the reporting airman that the incident occurred when a local scrap-iron company was conducting "skull-cracking" operations and the objects "widely-known" into the air and crashed through the roof of the building. Note: Skull-cracking is the breaking up of machinery and other metallic objects into small pieces to send back for smelting and re-casting.

RECOMMENDATION

In line with conclusion (4) above, it is recommended that Capt. C. B. Hanson, Comdr Flt 3-14, be contacted and requested to check on the locations of scrap-iron companies situated within a mile radius of the American Oil Company building. Further request Capt. Hanson inquire as to possible skull-cracking operations conducted by any such companies on 7 May 1955.
