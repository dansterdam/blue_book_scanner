AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

ATIL Office, D/I FEAF                                                 IR-27-52                                                 PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

crew was able to observe the body of the craft visually, while in addition, Ensign Gregory was able to observe the wing shape using binoculars. The hull was very large, estimated to be approximately sixty feet long with a dihedral at the tips, bending; approximately at eighty-five percent (85%) of the wing length.

No expansive was observed. The craft appeared to be flying at a high angle of attack, in the order of twenty-five degrees (25°), during the period it was observed from a good visual range. This flight attitude as viewed a high speed running to keep airborne at a slow speed. The craft accelerated slowly, increasing the range to sixteen miles, as indicated by radar. It then accelerated rapidly to a range of twenty-two miles, when contact was lost. Visual contact was lost also, due to clouds, approximately sixteen minutes after the initial contact. The computed air speed of the craft was five hundred and thirty (530) knots for the period just before contact was lost.

d. Patrol Plane Commander's Narrative:

At 0333I on the morning of 18 October 1951 at position 35-48N 123-16E, miles waist gunner of BD-5, Pilot Gregory, sighted a long conical flare at twelve miles bearing 270 degrees roll was. Radar confirmed the target. All hands double checked and confirmed. We were heading 191 degrees true. I made a turn to place the craft's between the moon and the target. Turn at about twelve miles. Out altitude was 5,000 feet; the craft was at about 4,000 feet. I explored radar power and closed to about three to four miles. Visual contact was maintained, however radar contact was lost. During this close period all hands observed the hull shape and I could see the wing contour through the binoculars. The craft's flame changed from a white-orange hue, when apparently power was added. The craft accelerated slowly to sixteen miles, again was confirmed by radar. It then accelerated with much rapidity to twenty-two miles where it was lost on radar. Visual contact was also lost due to clouds. Our true airspeed at this time was one hundred twenty. This, plus the computed speed relative to us, gave him a true airspeed of five hundred thirty knots. The chase was then discontinued. We were at 8,500 and twenty-two minutes had elapsed since the primary contact.

The craft's flame was extremely bright at all times. I believe it was using alcohol or solid fuel, as a normal jet flame is fairly low with much different appearance.

The hull was very large, I estimate sixty feet. The wings were swept back and down with a dihedral at the tips, bending approximately at eighty-five percent of the wing length. The tips appeared to surface for a rudder as none was visible.

The moon was full and visibility was relatively good.

I tried to silhouette him against the moon to obtain a picture, but was unable to.

His flight attitude when within good visual range was extremely "cocked up" at an angle of about twenty-five degrees, indicating a very high speed staggering, to keep airborne at slower speeds.

    Heading - Approximately same as planes
    Altitude - 4000 Feet
    Speed - 270° (approximate)
    Distance - 12 miles (by radar)

c. Summary of events:
    A waist gunner, on lookout duty at an open waist hatch, sighted a light on the port side and notified the PPC. The PPC saw the light, and through his contact to the station of the crew, which verified its existence. The radarman confirmed the contact, reporting the distance as twelve miles. The 11th appeared to be a long, constantly shaped plane, suggesting the nature of a reaction type motor, such as a rocket or ram-jet. The size, shape, and color of the flame seemed to vary during the period of observation. Initially the flame appeared to be short, with a red-orange hue; later the flame became longer with the color changing to a white-orange hue, apparently after power was added.

    The PPC turned left toward the contact, attempting to calibrate. The craft again left this zone, in order to photograph it. Evidently, the craft turned away, maintaining the distance of twelve miles, so a photograph was not obtained. Consequently, Design GREGORY increased the power setting to close the range. Radar contact was lost, but visual contact was maintained until the estimated range became three or four miles. Meanwhile, the crew was able to observe the body of the craft visually, while in addition, Design GREGORY was able to observe the wing shape using binoculars. The hull was very large, estimated to be sixty feet long. The wing area was great and dorm, with a dihedral at the time, bending approximately at eighty-five percent (85%) of the wing length. No antennae was observed. The craft appeared to be flying at a high angle of attack, in the order of twenty-five degrees (25°), during the period it was observed from a good visual range. This flight attitude suggested a high speed plane staging, to keep airborne at a slow speed. The craft accelerated slowly, increasing the range to sixteen miles, as indicated by radar. It then accelerated rapidly to a range of twenty-two miles, when contact was lost. Visual contact was lost, also, to the clouds. Approximately sixteen miles was the total visual contact.

a long conical plane at twelve miles bearing; 270 degrees relative. Radar confirmed the target. All hands double checked and confirmed. 16 was heading 161 degrees true. I rode a turn to place the craft between the moon and me. The craft turned also to East and pulled ahead to twelve miles. Our altitude was 5,000 feet; the craft was at about 4,000 feet. I applied visual power and closed to 16 miles. Visual contact was maintained, however radar contact was lost. During this close period all hands observed the hull shape and I could see the wing contour through the binoculars. The craft's flame change in amplitude and color; being short with a red-orange hue, and long with a white-orange hue, when apparently power was added. The craft accelerated slowly to 16 miles per hour and again was confirmed by radar. It then accelerated with much rapidity to twenty-two miles where it was lost on radar. Visual contact was also lost due to clouds. Our true airspeed at this time was one hundred seventy. This, plus his computed speed relative to us gave him a true airspeed of five hundred thirty knots. The chase was then discontinued. We were at 5,000 and twenty-two minutes had elapsed since the primary contact.

The craft's flame was extremely bright at all times. I believe it was using alcohol or solid fuel, as a normal jet flame is fairly low with a much different appearance.

The hull was very large, I estimate sixty feet. The wings were swept back and down with a dihedral at the tips, bending approximately at fifty-five percent of the air length. The tips appeared to surface. For a rudder as visible.

The moon was full and visibility was relatively good.

I tried to silhouette him against the moon to obtain a picture, but was unable to.

2. Later contents made by personnel who submitted the original report:

a. Maneuvering:
(1) The bogie apparently was flying an intercept course because:
    (a) It was flying at a very low rate of speed, approximately the same as the Mariner at the time of intercept, a much reduced speed for this type craft as evidenced by the very high angle of attack
    (b) Approx 25°. (b) This bogie course was parallel to the Mariner.
    (c) The bogie approaches the Mariner on the room is thus having the extreme advantage of the room illuminating the Mariner.
    (d) A distance of 12 miles is a possible distance for the bogie to operate with a high possibility of not being detected. (5) The bogie apparently was generally the Mariner close, because they allowed the Mariner to close in no closer than approximately 3 1/2 miles before taking evasive action. The Mariner was unable to maneuver into a position so as to silhouette the bogie against the moon.

b. Radar Contact:
(2) Radar contact was made with the bogie at the time of sighting and half continuously by until the range decreased to 5 to 1. miles. The radar contact was re-established as soon as the range of the bogie increased beyond the normal center of the scope clutter. The only reason available for the loss of the radar contact at 16 miles is that the bogie maneuvered up out of the beam pattern of the air to surface radar being employed by the Mariner.

c. Radar plots of the bogie are included as inclosures #1 and #2.

d. Sketch made by the patrol plane commander is attached as inclosure #3.

COMMENTS BY PREPARING OFFICER:
Visual limitations at this distance at night make accurate observation improbable. The best visual returns under the conditions shown would be from reflections in the searchlight. Under such conditions, shapes which have elastic highlight can appear to blend. A MiG-15, for instance, might appear as a craft with no apparent wing sketch, inclosure #1). Reflections off the wingtips of aircraft often give a distinct impression of tip tanks, and would probably account for the "no" distinction shown.

A jet aircraft flying at greatly reduced speed would, with certain fuel mixtures, form a visible exhaust flame.

The sighting was approximately 140 nautical miles from Taingho. It is believed that the "Bogie" was probably a normal 1st-type aircraft, possibly a MiG-15.
