AF FORM 112—PART II
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1958

UNCLASSIFIED

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency) 314TH AIR DIVISION, INTELLIGENCE    REPORT NO. TR-6-57    PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

8. None reported by weather station
   Two observers stated that a jeep or other type vehicle was sighted in area above the same time.

9. N/A

10. None

11. 2nd Lt. David R. Perdue, AO 3055962, Chief, Radar Intelligence. This officer was not able to question the observers due to the fact that they are stationed in the Seoul area. But descriptions sounds similar to those describing a weather balloon, although we have no information that a balloon was in this area. Words used by observers such as "hovering, settling" point to this possibility.

12. Existence of physical evidence
    a. N/A
