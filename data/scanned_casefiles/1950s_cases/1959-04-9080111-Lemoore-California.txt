My initial reaction of subject observation of aircraft with binoculars was as follows:
I was astonished and amazed at the Fabulous advancement of observation. Its size, its clarity, its crystal clear outline, its metallic body of lustrous of a varied nature, its graceful movement at high speed and well controlled flight.

Other objects, observed prior to my observation with binoculars, impressed observers of the area generally, maneuvering of aircraft and the high speed of flight. It was these objects that caused me to quickly bring out my binoculars and make a more detailed observation.

I verified the weather conditions with the U. S. Department of Commerce, Weather Bureau, which indicated ceiling unlimited with tops of Cirrus clouds, high, thin and scattered, visibility 15 miles. Cirrus clouds in that area are normally 20,000 ft. or higher. Winds at afternoon were roughly at 20,000 ft. at about 15 knots.

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting

TO: SAFIS-3 (Major L. J. Tacker)

1. Mr. [redacted] reported a UFO sighting to the ATIC on ATIC Form Mr. 164. The date of Mr. [redacted] sighting is 12 April 1959. Clarification of the information submitted as answer to questions on the report are required in order to evaluate this case. The referenced numbers are from the ATIC Form Mr. 164:

a. Number 10 - Mr. [redacted] checked "other" as to brightness of the object, but failed to be specific.

b. Number 19 - Mr. [redacted] indicates three objects, but fails to mention if all three were seen at the same time or at different times. If they were seen at the same time, he fails to mention the arrangement or formation.

c. Number 20 - Did not attempt to draw the apparent path of the object.

d. Number 23 - States the object disappeared in the distance and in Number 31 points out that the object was only five degrees from the zenith when it disappeared. However, there is no mention of radial velocity in the report.

e. Number 36(2) - It is the ATIC policy to categorize all cases which have only one witness as "insufficient evidence". It should be requested of [redacted] that he provide the names of the other witnesses.

f. Number 39 - Mr. [redacted] indicates a speed in excess of 1000 MPH. However, the angular velocity he spells out is only approximately 240 PER at 20,000 feet.

2. Mr. [redacted] states the object was in sight from five to ten seconds, but in this time he got his binoculars for a closer look.

3. Suggest you send [redacted] another questionnaire as a reference with your letter requesting this clarification.

This is to acknowledge receipt of Air Force questionnaire on your UFO sighting of 12 April 1959.

In order to complete the evaluation for this sighting, clarification of some of your answers is needed. In this regard, an additional questionnaire is enclosed for your convenience.

The following questions need clarification:

1. #10 - Since you checked "other" as to brightness of the object you need to be more specific and explain.

2. #19 - Were all three objects seen at the same time? If they were seen at the same time, please indicate arrangement or formation.

3. #20 - Please draw the apparent path of the object.

4. #23 - You stated the object disappeared in the distance and in question 31 you stated that the object was only five degrees from the zenith when it disappeared. Please give estimated radial velocity.

5. #35 - Please give the names of other witnesses if any.

6. #39 - You indicated the speed in excess of 1,000 miles per hour, however, the angular velocity indicates 240 miles per hour at 20,000 feet.

You also stated that the object was in sight from five to ten seconds, but indicated at the same time that you were able to get your binoculars for a closer look.

Please submit the revised questionnaire direct to the ATIC for evaluation.

20 May 1959

Dear [redacted]

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 7 May 1959 concerning Unidentified Flying Objects you saw recently.

The United States Air Force is charged with the responsibility of investigating and analyzing all cases of unidentified flying objects. In this, pursuant to the policy of the Air Force to inform the public, through the media of the press, all we learn in pursuit of this program.

To date the Air Force has, in our investigation of many cases, uncovered no physical evidence which would indicate the presence of any extra-terrestrial space vehicles and/or beings, nor has there been any evidence that unidentified flying objects constitute any threat or danger other than the remote possibility of being struck by a meteorite, etc.

For your information, I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheets on this subject. They plainly state the Air Force position on this matter. I am also inclosing U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet which you should fill out and forward direct to the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for evaluation of your recent sightings. When they have completed their analysis of your sightings, we will be happy to forward their evaluation to you.

Sincerely,

Re: Identity of Unconventional
Flying Ships.

Dear Mr. Secretary:

Congratulations! If those unconventional flying vehicles, I observed recently, are a part of your Air Force you are certainly to be complimented on the magnificent job that has been done in their development. As a veteran of the Air Force of World War II, I am still aghast at the performance of these flying ships!

If they, truly, are not a part of your Air Force, God help us! Certainly, you must be interested in what is going on in our air space; and if, truly, these are not secret operations of your Air Force, then is there any section of the Air Force that is set up to handle the evaluation of these ships' performances and missions? I so, please advise the procedure for a civilian to report same.

Myself and three other responsible, sober citizens (two, ex Air Force members) observed, in the middle of the day, the performance of three unconventional airships. The writer observed the performance of one with binoculars which left nothing to the imagination. Would appreciate an early reply as to whether these unconventional flying ships are a part of your airforce. If not what are you doing about it?

Most respectfully yours,
Vice President
