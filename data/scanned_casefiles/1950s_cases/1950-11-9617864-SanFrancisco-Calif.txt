SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT
Observed directly overhead San Francisco, California at approximately 2320 hours, 3 November 1950.

TO: Director of Special Investigations, USAF,
Washington 25, D.C.

SUBJECT: Unusual object observed directly overhead San Francisco at 2320 hours, 3 November 1950.

DETAILS: On 3 November 1950 Mr. _____ was interviewed and stated that he in company with eight or ten other people observed a bright object in the sky directly overhead. It while flying towards the west from the east and disappeared after about 20 seconds. The object was observed for a period of twenty (20) to thirty (30) seconds and appeared to be of a silver dollar color, white, larger than an ordinary star. No sound or dynamic features were observed. It appeared to be suspended in the sky with no evidence of any drive mechanism. The object was stated to have been observed at approximately 20,000 feet. This was based upon comparison with a medium type jet aircraft in the area. The dimensions were approximated to be smaller than a medium type jet aircraft with no previous aeronautical experience.

3. ACTION: None.

Transcribing the text from the document:

NOTES:
1. If the sounding reaches above the 120 "sea" level, the top of the figure is in contact with the pressure registered in absolute atmospheres, which will then be a "gage" pressure rather than a "static" pressure.

2. This diagram is in all typical respects equivalent to the Psychrometric charted except that the ordinates represent absolute pressure rather than dry-bulb temperature, and the abscissae represent humidity ratio rather than dry-bulb temperature.

By international agreement, computed heights are expressed in terms of geoidal rather than true elevations, i.e. in geopotential meters, with the relation between z and h given by:

h = hs = 9d z

Since the numerical value of z is very nearly equal to 0.98 z geoidal, for all practical purposes, and the two values may be used interchangeably.

The saturated-adiabatics, and the isentropes of saturated specific humidity are computed by the use of the vapor pressure over ice at temperatures below freezing. This results in an inflection of these curves at that temperature.

1 cal on the diagram represents an energy of 1 joule/gram*°C.

CONSTANTS: 
Gas constant for dry air: 0.2870 joule/g°C
Freezing point of water: 273.16°K

This document does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a technical report or document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The image shows a grid diagram with annotations and labels. The text at the top indicates this is a "GRAM" and the diagram contains a scale from -40 to -50°C. There are also several labeled sections with time and station information.

The text below the diagram provides explanations for the various elements and annotations in the diagram, such as the meaning of the straight horizontal lines, the slightly curved lines running diagonally, and the "saturated-adiabatics" curved lines.

EXPLANATIONS:
ISOTARS are the straight, horizontal lines. The heights in meters of the
pressure surfaces in the U.S.A. atmosphere are written in increasu (t) on
the left hand side of the diagram.
SATADABATICS (irreversible) are the curved lines running diagonally from
the left upwards to the right.
SATURATION-ADIABATICS (like those of equal potential temperature, or istry)
are the slightly curved lines running diagonally from the right upwards to the
left.
SATUBATED-ADIABATICS (irreversible) are the curved lines that intersect
the isobars at intervals of 2°c, diverging upwards and tending to
become parallel to the dryadiabatics. Temperatures of these lines are given
in C°.
HUMIDITY mixing ratio of saturated air (in gm. per kg.) is represented
by broken lines. Their value appear at the center of the diagram.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a graph or chart displaying "SKEW T, log p - DIAL" measurements, which are likely related to meteorological or atmospheric data.

Form: WRC 9-16
SKEW T, log p - DIAL
The chart displays various pressure, temperature, and other measurements on a grid, likely used for weather analysis or research.
