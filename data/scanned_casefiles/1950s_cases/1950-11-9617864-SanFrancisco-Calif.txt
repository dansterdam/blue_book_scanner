SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT
           Observed directly overhead San Francisco,
           California at approximately 0930 hours,
           3 November 1950

TO:        Director of Special Investigations,
           Headquarters USAF,
           Washington 25, D. C.

1. SYNOPSIS: Unusual object observed in sky directly
             overhead San Francisco at 0930 hours, 3 November 1950.

2. DETAILS: On 3 November 1950 Mr. [redacted] East Palo Alto, California was interviewed and stated
that he in company with eight or ten other people observed a bright
object in the sky directly overhead. At this time they were working
in the Southern Pacific Freight Yard at 4th and 5th Street to Townsend,
San Francisco, California. The object was observed for a period of
twenty (20) to thirty (30) minutes; shape appeared round; size was
that of a silver dollar; color was white; only one (1) observed; no
aero dynamics features discernible; no trailer exhaust or propulsion
system observed; it appeared to be suspended in the air; no sound,
moved approximately 10° across the sky in twenty (20) to thirty (20)
(3d) minute period. No unusual features noticed. Altitude estimated
at 20,000 feet. This was based upon comparison with a medium type
aircraft. Observers were all railway employees with no previous
aeronautical experience.

3. ACTION: None.

             Air Material Command,

Here is the text from the document:

NOTES: 1. If the sounding reaches above the 120 m. level, the top of the sounding will be plotted using the pressures indicated in brackets [ ] alone.

2. This diagram is in all physical respects equivalent to the "temp-gra. If differs from the temp-gra in that the isobars are straight and the dry-adiabatics curved in the former, whereas the isobars are curved and the dry-adiabatics straight in the latter.

3. By international agreement, computed weights are expressed in terms of geopotential meters. If a denotes height in geopotential meters, and z denotes height in some other meters, the relation between h and z is, by definition:

h = h₀ + 5/4 [h₁(h₁/z₁) dz

Since the mean numerical value of z is very nearly equal to the mean z², the numerical value of h and z are equal, for all practical purposes, and the two units so used are interchangeably.

4. The saturated-adiabatics, and the isobars of saturated specific humidity are computed by the use of the vapor pressure over ice at temperatures below 0°C. This results in an inflation of these curves at that temperature.

5. 1 cm on the diagram represents an energy of 3/2 joules/g°.

CONSTANTS
Gas constant for dry air:   0.2870 joule/g °C
Freezing point of water:    273.16°K

The document contains a complex grid chart with multiple intersecting lines and numerical values, which appears to be a thermodynamic diagram or chart used for meteorological calculations.

EXPLANATIONS

ISOBARS are the straight, horizontal lines. The heights in meters of the pressure surfaces in the I.C.A.M. isopress are written in brackets () below the pressures on the left hand side of the diagram.

ISOTHERM are the straight, equidistant lines running diagonally from the left upwards to the right.

DRY-ADIABATICS (i.e. lines of equal potential temperature, or entropy) are the slightly curved lines running diagonally from the right upwards to the left.

SATURATED-ADIABATICS (reversible) are the curved lines that intersect the 1000, 100, 850 mb isobaric levels. Diverging upwards and tending to become parallel to the dry-adiabatics. Temperatures of these lines are given in °C.

HUMIDITY mixing ratio of saturated air (in gm. per kg.) is represented by dashed lines. Their values appear at the bottom of the chart.

Thickness (in tens of geopotential meters) of the layers between the levels 1000, 700, 500, 300 and 150 mb. The levels of the standard synoptic curve(s) is represented by numbers and a saturation along the middle of each layer. The thickness are obtained from the virtual temperature curve by the quasi-area method, using the straight line as a dividing line (visible).

Note: The rest of the text at the bottom is partially cut off and illegible.

The image contains a complex grid chart with various numerical scales and crosshatched lines. The vertical axis appears to represent pressure levels from 0 to 400, and the horizontal axis shows temperature or related measurements from 50 to -30. The chart is labeled "SKEW T, log p - DIA[" with some numbers and labels like 50, 120, 150, 250, and 300 visible at different points on the grid.
