MONTREAL, APRIL 13, 1959 -- U.S. AIR FORCE AUTHORITIES WERE BAFFLED TODAY BY A MYSTERIOUS "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT" THAT SHOWED UP AS A RED LIGHT OVER CANADA'S KEY AIR DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT NEAR HERE AND DISAPPEARED SHORTLY AFTER BEING SPOTTED.

THE OBJECT WHICH DID NOT REGISTER ON RADAR SCREENS WAS SEEN AT MT. ROYAL, ROYAL CANADIAN AIR FORCE STATION, NEAR CLOSE OBSERVERS AT THE ALERT, MONTREAL AIRBASE AND BY SEVERAL HUNDRED OTHER AIRPORT PERSONNEL AND DISTRICT RESIDENTS.

IN AN CONTINUING U.S. (UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT) AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED, AN AIR FORCE SPOKESMAN SAID.

THE CT. HUBERT AIR CONTROL TOWER REPORTED THE OBJECT WAS SIMILAR TO A RED LIGHT. A TOWER OBSERVER SAID IT SEEMED TO HANG IN THE SKY AT GREAT HEIGHT, AND, WHEN OVER THE PIRET AREA IN MINUTES, THEN DARTED NORTH. THEY ESTIMATED ITS SPEED AS FASTER THAN ANY JET.

IT WAS REGARDED AS TECHNICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS PICKED UP ON RADAR SCREENS THAT COVER ST. HUBERT AND THE MONTREAL AREA.

GROUND CREWS THAT WATCHED IT PASSED VARIED IN THEIR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE OBJECT. SOME SAID IT WAS LIKE A "BLACK BALL WITH A RED LIGHT ON IT."

ONE WITNESS, GEORGE THOMPSON WHO LIVES NORTHWEST MONTREAL, SAID IT LOOKED LIKE "A LARGE SPHERE HANGING IN THE SKY TO THE SOUTHEAST." HE SAID THAT AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO BE STANDING STILL, BUT THEN MOVED OFF AND TOOK "ABOUT FOUR MINUTES" TO PASS OUT OF HIS SIGHT.
