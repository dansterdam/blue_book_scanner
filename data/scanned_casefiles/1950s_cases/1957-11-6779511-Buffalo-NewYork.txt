Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Light in Their Eyes:
Caused by Venus
In Buffalo, N.Y., a light in the sky was observed on November 6, 1957 which was similar to the light in the eyes of the "Venusians" described by the Air Force in Project Blue Book, a top secret file. The Air Force said that the light was caused by the planet Venus, which was very brilliant at that time. A similar light was seen in the sky over Buffalo on the same night.
