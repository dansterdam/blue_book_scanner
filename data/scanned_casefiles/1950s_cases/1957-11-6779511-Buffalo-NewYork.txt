Light in Their Eyes
Caused by Venus

Buffalo, Nov. 6 (JP)â€”Scores of persons in the Buffalo area boarded tonight with reports of a luminous object flying in the southwestern sky. The Air Force, which, sent a jet interceptor to investigate, said no sighting and said the object apparently was the planet Venus. A similar report was made in the Boston area was blasted on Venus and the celestial bodies.

Most of the document appears to have illegible text due to the image quality and redactions/blacked out sections.
