AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (Agency)
Flight 3-H, 14602a AISS
COMMENTS OF Preparing Officer:
a. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the UFOB sighting reported by the observer at West Chester, Pennsylvania at 23/16302 Sep 55 was probably the result of a balloon within the balloon caught in a fluctuat-ing current of air.
b. The appearance of the UFOB from the observer's description and memory sketch seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a radiosondc weather balloon.
c. The wind data collected from the Greater Pittsburgh Airport seems to extend the possibility of there having been a radiosondc balloon in the vicinity of West Chester, Pennsylvania at the approximate time of the sighting, provided it was a function in the balloon which was released at 0300 EST.
d. The near coincidence in time that the Swarthmore balloon was re-leased does not change the conclusion which it encountered during its ascent does not preclude the possibility of it having drifted toward the vicinity of West Chester at that time.
2. The absence of sound associated with the object seems to negate the change of its having been a self-powered, simultaneously increasing the chance that it was probably a friendly object.
CHESTER E. HANSON
Captain, USAF
Officer In Charge
COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this a sighting was probably caused by a radiosondc type weather balloon.

REPORT NO. 3-II-UFOB-9-55 Part One
PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES
I. SOURCE: Mrs. (Redacted information) (Godfry GJQR 2557)
Age: 33
Occupation: Housewife
Education: College
Qualifications: 20/15 vision, uncorrected
II. RELIABILITY: Good. SOURCE was contacted personally.
III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 23 September 1955 at 12:30 EDST a circular daylight to dark purple-blue-gray object appeared on the horizon but was unable to see the aircraft. She began scanning the sky, when suddenly she noticed the appearance of a strange flying object, oval-shaped and char-coal gray in color, moving across the sky.
SOURCE watched this object perform a continuous counter-clockwise rotation which continued as the object moved away and out of sight. The time of sighting was between 3 and 5 minutes.
SOURCE could discern no sound being emitted by the UFOB during the time of sighting, but there was much attention to the sky, during the UFOB sighting an unidentified airliner, flying low at what ÙOURCE estimated to have been 4,000 feet, followed and to the right of the UFOB.
In addition to the oval-like configuration of the UFOB already noted, SOURCE described that she had thought it due to get a set of 7 to 8 individual pulses or oscillations, well as a circular object just off the right side of the UFOB. UTJRCE was certain that the smaller object was moving independent of the larger one.
SOURCE described the UFOB'S physical appearance to have resembled the cover of an alligator skin purse with slightly irregular protruded and visible.
The condition of the sky was overcast with an approximate 3500" ceiling.
No photographs were taken of the UFOB.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: LEGEND:
Flight 9-H, 46024 A139

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORT:

1. The officer on duty at the New Castle, Delaware, County Airport Weather Station (GCQK 2640) was contacted and furnished the following information. His station received a call from this office on 23 September, inquiring whether balloons had been launched that day. No balloons had been launched on 23 September. However, on the 24th September, balloons were released at about four intervals through the day and they would have floated in the direction of West Chester, Pennsylvania, after passing through the Chester, Pennsylvania area. After the caller's report, the station received no further information.

2. The US Weather Bureau at Philadelphia International Airport (GCQK 4639) was contacted and queried about balloon releases on 23 September. The records checked revealed that five pilot balloons had been released and tracked on that date. This agency referred the ATIS investigator to the field unit which supplies them with such information.

3. A check with the 24th AA GP located at Swartnhmore, Pa. (GCQK 3754) disclosed that balloons in 1000 FT., 1600 FT., 2000 FT. and 2400 FT. and this schedule was adhered to on the 23rd September. The balloons were of the regular type, carrying radiosondes equipment consisting of a small modulator and two thermistors. The last balloon was released at 1030 EDT. The balloons were released at 1000 EDT. The reason this was done, was to determine the wind aloft information for use in weather forecasting.

4. A further check with the 24th AA GP Ground Meteorological Section near Swarthmore, Pa. (GCQK 3756) disclosed the following data obtained from the balloon which was released at 10:16 EDT on 23 September 1955:

Time After Flight: 
10:16 (Released)
10:18 250.° 
10:20 274.8
10:22 302.9
10:24 307.4
10:26 125.9 
10:28 124.9
10:30 (Last Reading) 122.0

This balloon may have burst shortly after the last reading was made or it may have risen higher and drifted into winds which could have carried it towards the vicinity of West Chester. It is believed that the balloon contained sufficient helium to have remained aloft for some few hours after its release at 10:16 EDT, and could have drifted into the West Chester, Pennsylvania, and the Coatesville, New Jersey area.

G.CQK 2639 notes that the officer on duty at the New Castle Air Force Base, Delaware, stated that no other balloon data nor any weather information for inclusion in the preliminary report. The ceiling at that time had been 2500 FT. To the Weather Officer's knowledge, there had been no meteorological releases of any kind in the immediate vicinity of West Chester, Pa. on 23 September 1955.

6. The US Weather Bureau in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (Geogr GJPL 0316) reported that the only balloons which they release are ceiling balloons measuring 15"-20" and 24"-30" in diameter which do not carry radar equipment. They are released at 0600 EST, 1000 EST, 1600 EST and 2000 EST at intervals of one hour.

7. A check with the US Weather Bureau at Greater Pittsburgh Airport (Geogr GJLC 0227) revealed that radiosonde balloons had been released from this station on 23 September at the following times: 0600 EST, 1000 EST, 1600 EST, and 2200 EST. The forecaster on duty felt that under normal conditions one of these balloons would one of the time have attained a sufficient altitude for it to have burst. If this had been the case with respect to the balloon launched at 0600 EST, it may feasibly have drifted in the higher velocity wind currents that are common above 35,000 ft, reaching the vicinity of the incident at the approximate time the UFO was observed.

The following data was recorded on the balloon released at 0600 EST:
Altitude (ft) Wind Direction Wind Velocity (knots)
6,000 250 14
8,000 250 19
10,000 270 26
14,000 270 22
20,000 270 26
25,000 280 40
30,000 290 52
35,000 300 62
45,000 310 59
50,000 320 70

8. A check with Air Traffic Control at Friendship Field (Geogr GJJF 2313), Pennsylvania on 23 September.

9. Air Traffic Control at Philadelphia International Airport advising that no confirmation on the USAF sighting.

10. The Weather Station at Ft. Meade, Maryland (Geogr GJRK 1607) was called by telephone but had nothing to offer in the way of confirmation on the USAF sighting.

11. Operations at the 647th AC&W Sq in Manassas, Virginia (Geogr GJNR 2307) was also contacted but had no information to relate which might serve to confirm the sighting of a USAF near West Chester, Pennsylvania on 23 September 1955.
