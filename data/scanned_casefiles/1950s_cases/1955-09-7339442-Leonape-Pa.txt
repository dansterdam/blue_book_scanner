AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency): Flight 3-H, 4602d AISS                REPORT NO. 34-UFOB-9-55                Part Three    PAGE 8 of 8 PAGES

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:    P-R-O-B-A-B-L-E

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the UFOB sighting reported by the observer at West Chester, Pennsylvania at 23/1630z Sep 55 was probably the result of alarm upon seeing a radiosonde weather balloon caught in a fluctuating current of air.

a. The appearance of the UFOB from the observer's description and memory sketch seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a radiosonde weather balloon.

b. The wind data collected from the Greater Pittsburg Airport seems to extend the possibility of there having been a radiosonde balloon in the vicinity of West Chester, Pennsylvania at the approximate time of the sighting, providing there was a leakage in the balloon which was released at 0400 EST.

c. The fact that the object was not picked up on radar in the vicinity suggests that it was not a metal object as believed by the observer.

d. The near coincidence in time that the Swarthmore balloon was released and the changing winds during its ascent does not preclude the possibility of its having drifted toward the vicinity of West Chester at the approximate time that the UFOB was sighted.

2. The absence of sound associated with the object seems to negate the chance of its being unself-propelled, simultaneously increasing the chance that it was probably a friendly object.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by a radiosonde type weather balloon.

II. RELIABILITY: Good. SOURCE was contacted personally.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 23 September 1955 at 12:30 EDST a sound similar to the sputtering of a light plane's engine drew her attention to the sky. SOURCE dashed around to the side of her house in order to scan the horizon but was unable to see the aircraft. She began scanning the sky, when suddenly she noticed the appearance of a strange flying object, oval-shaped and char-acterized in color across the sky.

SOURCE watched the object perform a counter-clockwise rotational movement which continued as the object moved away and out of sight. The time of sighting was between two and five minutes. Its course seemed to be due west.

SOURCE could discern no sound being emitted by the UFOB during the time she observed it, even though it was the sputtering sound which had first drawn her attention to the sky. During the UFOB sighting an unidentified airliner, flying low at what SOURCE estimated to have been 1,000 ft., flew below and to the right of the UFOB.

In addition to the oval-like configuration of the UFOB already noted, SOURCE described that after she had dashed inside to get a set of 7 x 50 binoculars, she was able to distinguish a small blister on the ventral center of the object as well as a circular object just off the right side of the UFOB. SOURCE was certain that the smaller object was moving independent of the larger one.

SOURCE described the UFOB's physical appearance to have resembled the cover of an alligator skin purse with slightly irregular protrusions visible.

The condition of the sky was overcast with an approximate 3500' ceiling.

No photographs were taken of the UFOB.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 341, 46024 A159                     38-UFOB-9-55           Part Two    Page 4 of 8 Pages

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. The officer on duty at the New Castle, Delaware, County Airport Weather Station (GeaRef GJQ 2640) was contacted and furnished the following information. His station released calling balloons at Stergular Intervals. Inflated, this type of balloon measures approximately 18" in diameter, is frail and usually bursts before reaching 5,000 ft. No balloons had been launched on 23 September, however, on the 24th several ceiling balloons were released at one hour intervals throughout the day and would have floated in the direction of West Chester, Pennsylvania. The latter report, however, offered no confirmation on the sighting of a UFO on 23 September.

2. The US Weather Bureau at Philadelphia International Airport (GeaRef GJQ 4653) was telephoned and queried about balloon release on 23 September. The forecaster on duty stated that no balloons had been released by them on the 23rd of September. This agency referred the AISS investigator to the Field unit which supplies them with raw weather data, this being the 24th AA Gp.

3. A check with Hqs Batt, 24th AA Gp located at Swarthmore, Pa., (GeaRef GJQ 1660 EET, 1600 EET, 2000 EET) and 24th EET and this schedule was adhered to on the 23rd September, with/without exception of the 1000 EDT release which was made at 1016 EDT. The balloon was of the regular type, carrying radiosonde equipment consisting of a small modulator box approximately 6" square and a come-shaped transmitter, both mounted in a white plastic box which is suspended by a small red parachute to the balloon. When the balloon bursts between 50,000-and 60,000 ft, the parachute inflates, carrying the radiosonde equipment safely to the ground. A white or gray 91 diameter neoprene with attached radiosonde equipment could be seen from the ground for several thousand feet, depending on the vision of the observer or the visual aids used.

4. A further check with the 24th AA Gp Ground Meteorological Section near Swarthmore, Pa., (owner GJQ 3758) allowed the following data obtained from the balloon which was released at 10:16 EDT on 23 September 1955:

Time After Release       Azimuth of Balloon
10:16 (Released)         259°
10:18                    274.8
10:20                    302.9
10:22                    307.4
10:32                    121.9
10:42                    146.8
10:49 (Last Reading)     134.2

This balloon may have burst shortly after the last reading was made or it may have risen higher and drifted into winds which could have carried it toward the vicinity of West Chester, Pa., however this isn't definitely known. From the wind data above, the indication is that this balloon drifted toward Southern New Jersey in the Chesapeake Area.

5. Base Weather and Operations at Newcastle Air Force Base, Delaware (GeaRef GJQ 2639) was contacted. The officer on duty stated that his activity did not release weather balloons. He further stated that he had furnished 82nd Ftg Gp Operations with the weather information for inclusion in the preliminary report. The ceiling at the time had been 3500 ft. To the Weather Officer's knowledge, there had been no meteorological releases of any kind in the immediate vicinity of West Chester, Pa. on 23 September 1955.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS: (Cont)

6. The US Weather Bureau in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (GeORef GJPL 0816) reported that the only balloons which they release are ceiling balloons measuring 15'-20" and 24"-30" in diameter which do not carry radonde equipment. They are released at 0400EST 1000 EST, 1600 EST, and 2200 EST and remain aloft seldom over an hour.

7. A check with the US Weather Bureau at Greater Pittsburg Airport (GeORef GJIL 0227) revealed that radiosonde balloons had been released from this station on 23 September at the following times, 0400 EST, 1000 EST, and 2200 EST. The forecaster on duty felt that only under unusual conditions would one of their balloons have drifted as far as West Chester. In the event of a leak in the balloon, it probably would not have attained a sufficient altitude for it to have burst. If this had been the case with respect to the balloon launched at 0400 EST, it may feasibly have been drifted in the higher velocity wind currents that are common above 35,000 ft, reaching the vicinity of the sighting at the approximate time the UFOB was observed.

The following data was recorded on the balloon released at 0400 EST:

[A table is included with columns for Altitude (ft), Wind Direction, and Wind Velocity (knots)]

8. A check with Air Traffic Control at Friendship Field (GeORef GJFK 2212), Md., yielded no confirmation on the unidentified flying object observed near West Chester, Pennsylvania on 23 September.

9. Air Traffic Control at Philadelphia International Airport likewise is unable to offer confirmation on the UFOB sighting.

10. The Weather Station at Ft. Meade, Maryland (GeORef GJPK 1607) was called by telephone but had nothing to offer in the way of confirmation on the UFOB.

11. Operations at the 647th AC&W Sq in Manassas, Virginia (GeORef GVNJ 2007) was also contacted but had no information to relate which might serve to confirm the sighting of a UFOB near West Chester, Pennsylvania on 23 September 1955.
