RICHMOND, INDIANA
24 MAY 1954

At 1225 (EST) on 24 May 1954, an Air Force Major, flying a photographic mapping mission near Richmond, Indiana, observed and photographed what appeared to be a large, high-intensity light moving below his aircraft. The light traveled a distance of six miles over the ground at a speed twice that of the aircraft.

Intensive studies of the photographs were made. The studies indicated that the light was not a material object.

Extensive investigations, exploring all possible clues and avenues of approach to the probable nature of the object were made. The ground under both the path taken by the aircraft and the object were examined with a fine tooth comb. Photographs were made of the area for a study of ground characteristics or other clues. Aircraft flights, radar units and other operations were immediately checked carefully, with negative results.

The data was submitted to a panel of scientists and specialists, which included astronomers, meteorologists, and a physicist. It was concluded that the sighting was a very rare aerial phenomena caused by the reflection of the sun's rays upon an ice-crystal platellite formation.

Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, formerly head of the Project "Bluebook" UFO Investigation, told in his book (Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Doubleday, 1956, p. 312) of the May 24, 1954, photograph taken by the crew of an RB-29 near Dayton.

Since the Air Force has typically declassified UFO reports, I wonder if it would be possible to obtain a print of the photograph.

Ruppelt referred to: I am aware that it showed only light, but I would like to see a print of it nevertheless.

Sincerely,

RR/mt

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

PROBLEM:
1. To obtain approval for proposed travel by Captain Charles A. Hardin to Richmond, Indiana and vicinity.

FACTS AND DISCUSSION:
2. On 24 May 1954 an unidentified flying object was sighted and photographed from a mapping aircraft near Richmond, Indiana.

3. The purpose of the trip will be to determine the area characteristics and whether or not anyone sighted the object from the ground.

4. This appears to be a significant case in which a complete investigation should be made.

5. It is proposed that the traveler be in Richmond, Indiana for one day, 3 May 1954; travel time should not exceed one day.

6. The traveler certifies that no expense items for which he is responsible will become delinquent during the period of his temporary duty and travel outside the ATIC.

UFO Sighting (24 May 1954)                                     19 NOV 1958

SAFOI-34 (Major Tasker)

1. The sighting referred to in the attached letter from Mr. Taylor is carried in the AFR 210 file as a reflection.

2. The case was given very extensive coverage and the witness was always cooperative. On 24 May a photograph (the aircraft was while this sighting took place was a B-17, outfitted for photo-reconnaissance work).

3. While there are certain errors in the reporting, which can probably be attributed to the excitement of the witnesses, the photograph, when compared with airmen data and the position of the B-17, leaves no doubt that the object is a reflection of the sun from ice crystals.

MEMORANDUM FOR Director of Intelligence
ATTN: Chief of Management

SUBJECT: (UNCL) Unidentified Flying Object Information

1. An unidentified flying object was sighted and photographed near Richmond, Indiana on 24 May 1954 at 1225 (EST) by Major Lee M. Reconnaisance Branch, Aerial Reconnaissance Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, while on a photo mapping mission.

The object was first visually sighted to the west of Richmond (9525N 85W) and to the right of the observing aircraft. The length of the observation was 45 seconds in which time the object covered a distance of 6 miles over the ground (900 KM) disappearing over the residential area of southwest Richmond. The photograph was taken about midway through the observation on the instructions of Major Lee M. to the camera crew. The object was not visible to the other crew members due to its position under the aircraft. The photographing aircraft (B-17) was at 15500 ft flying at 252 MPH. The object was estimated to have been at 3000 ft ground.

2. The photograph as well as the description by the observer, indicate that the light was of very high intensity. No detail of any object could be made out by the observer or from the photograph. Calculations, based on the observer's estimates show that the diameter of the light would have been 617 ft at ground level or 450 ft at 5000 ft.

3. Major [redacted] is considered to be a very reliable and accurate observer.

4. The photograph was taken straight down with a mapping camera, lens 6" and F-11. Weather was clear in the area. Sun altitude was 70°, azimuth 171°. Temperature was -10 at 18,500 ft and 84 at 10,000 ft.

5. Aircraft activity and radar plots in the area have been checked with negative results. The area has also been re-photographed for a study of the ground characteristics.

NOTE ON REFLECTION AND DIFFRACTION FROM ICE CRYSTALS IN THE SKY
- Charles F. Squire, The Rice Institute, Houston, Texas
(Received June 9, 1954)

Observations of the reflected light from ice crystals in the sky have been made for centuries and such natural phenomena as "mock suns" are well known.¹ On February 6, 1952, I observed and repeatedly photographed the reflection of sunlight from ice crystals while flying in an airplane at 12,000 ft. over the mountain country of Tennessee. The time of day was approximately noon, and it was cold. The ground below was visible through the blue haze caused by the ice crystals. The reflected image of the sun was so intense that the camera speed was 1/200 sec and the aperture was nearly closed. The dark green of the mountain trees and a stream in a valley can be seen in Fig. 1.

The diffraction ring around the central image is just what one would expect for light coming through these fine crystals. It is interesting to note that the image and diffraction ring have an elliptical shape, and I confess that I do not know why this is so. Certainly the ice crystals have their flat surfaces all normal to the vertical. The assumption that a wind could produce an ordering orientation of the crystals in the horizontal plane would allow one to suppose a different diffraction spacing in the x direction than in the y direction. This would give an elliptical diffraction ring, but I do not understand why the central image should be out of round.

The spot of light would sometimes be close to the aircraft (it appeared large) and would sometimes be far away (it appeared small). The image kept the angle of reflection of the sun's rays, and this was checked repeatedly when the image coincided with the sun's reflection from a body of water on the ground below. A change of density of the ice crystals would cause the apparent shift in distance. Since the spot of light kept pace with the air-
