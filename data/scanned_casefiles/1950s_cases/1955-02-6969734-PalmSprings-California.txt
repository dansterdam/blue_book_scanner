BIG EXPLOSION
REPORTED
MYSTERIOUS OBJECT
IN SKY

(New Zealand Press Association)
GREYMOUTH, February 6
A mysterious explosion of terrific force, and a strange object seen in the sky over the West Coast was under investigation tonight throughout the district tonight. No explosion, nor of the object, with which it apparently was linked, could be traced, but observers at widely-separated points gave similar descriptions of the object. It was stated to be cigar-shaped, bright silver in appearance, and travelling at great speed. It was impossible to join altitude as it moved inland.

Mysterious Blast
In New Zealand
AUCKLAND, N.Z., Feb. 6 —
A mysterious explosion of terrific force knocked the west coast of New Zealand's South Island today. A strange silver object flashing overhead at the same time was reported.

Observers at widely-separated points described the object as cigar-shaped and emitting a dazzling light and travelling at high speed. They said it lost altitude as it moved inland toward the Southern Alps.

On Monday, February 8, there appeared in The New York Herald Tribune an AP report from Auckland, New Zealand, saying that a mysterious explosion of terrific force had shaken the west coast of New Zealand's South Island the day before. A strange silver shape flashing overhead at the same time was reported. "Observers at widely separated points described the object as cigar-shaped and emitting a dazzling light and travelling at high speed. They said it lost altitude as it moved inland toward the Southern Alps."

The explosion was heard by men at Greymouth Creek, 20 miles northwest, it was violent as a clap of thunder, and approximately southwest to north 10 miles from Greymouth and at another point 25 miles from Greymouth, about 25 miles from Greymouth.

The explosion was heard and felt in an area of several hundred square miles.

METEORITE—OR WHAT?

Mysterious Green Fireball
Brightens Night Over Texas

TYLER, Tex., Feb. 14 (A — A There were unconfirmed reports as far as Jackson, Miss., to the Gulf, but a search failed to hit the ground, but east and Mineral Wells in west a fiery glow over three men no evidence of it had been found. Information indicated it was first flashed like a "huge electric arc" seen here and disappeared some hours later. The Weather Bureau at Dallas got reports of people seeing its glow Sunday night.

It was apparently a meteorite.

Here's his story:
"Around midnight this light seemed to pop out of the sky directly above us. It looked like a huge electric arc. It was greenish, like the tip of a welder's torch.

"IT WAS going due south. There were three of us in the tower. We of course had the lights on, but the room lighted up brilliantly. It was a blinding light, the brightest I ever saw. We all turned and watched it disappear to the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon. It looked like a football with a short tail. It lasted just a second."

THE MOST vivid account came from J. N. Aber, control tower operator at Pounds Field here.

Radioactive Fiber
At Horseheads

HORSEHEADS, N. Y., Feb. 22 — Dr. Charles B. Rutenberg, chemistry professor at Elmira College, identified today as radioactive a curtain of wispy gray fuzz that spread over part of this village two days ago. He said the fuzz was badly damaged, slightly radioactive cotton fiber.

Where the fiber came from — two houses along Sunday night was a mystery. Dr. Rutenberg said tests showed that the fiber was apparently waste material of a substance which had been heavily damaged in some sort of explosion.

Horseheads is a village of about 3,600 population, six miles north of Elmira in the south-central part of New York State. Dr. Rutenberg said the radioactivity was not present to dangerous degree.

The Atomic Energy Commission's New York office doubted that the radioactivity came from Friday's test shot in Nevada.

In one of the three incidents reported in other months (Horseheads, New York, February 21, 1955) the angel hair was identified as waste products from the local milk plant.

On February 24, at Horseheads, N.Y., there fell a wispy gray fuzz of badly damaged cotton fiber. It was radioactive.

FEB. 3, 1955 BETWEEN MAIQUETIA AND MERIDA (KEYHOE-1955 P 249) 5 WITNESSES

AN AEROPOST AIRLINER, PILOTED BY CAPTAIN [REDACTED], A FAMOUS VENEZUELAN FLYER, WAS FLYING AT 7500 FEET BETWEEN BARQUISIMETO AND VALERA. IT WAS A CLEAR DAY, WITH VISIBILITY UNLIMITED, UNTIL 11:15 A.M. THE FLIGHT WAS NORMAL.

SUDDENLY, CAPTAIN [REDACTED] AND HIS COPILOT, A STRANGE ROUND APPARATUS FLYING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE PLANE, ROTATING COUNTERCLOCKWISE.

THE MYSTERIOUS MACHINE SHONE WITH A GREENISH LIGHT. AROUND ITS CENTER WAS A RED RING OR BAND WHICH EMITTED FLASHES OF BRILLIANT LIGHT. ABOVE AND BELOW THIS BAND WERE WHAT APPEARED TO BE LIGHTED PORTHOLES.

HURRIEDLY CAPTAIN [REDACTED] CUT IN HIS MIKE TO CALL THE BARQUISIMETO RADIO.

RECEIVER HAD GONE DEAD. (LATER THE BARQUISIMETO RADIO OPERATORS STATED THAT JUST AS CAPTAIN [REDACTED] HAD BEGUN HIS REPORT, COMMUNICATION WAS CUT OFF.)

AS CAPTAIN [REDACTED] WENT BACK TO ALERT THE PASSENGERS, [REDACTED] BANKED TOWARD THE ROTATING UFO. INSTANTLY THE OBJECT WHIRLED DOWNWARD, THEN, LEVELING OFF, IT RACED AWAY AT TREMENDOUS SPEED.

WHEN THE PLANE LANDED, THE PILOTS LEARNED OF THE SUDDEN BREAK IN RADIO COMMUNICATION -- NOT ONLY AT BARQUISIMETO BUT AT VALERA, WHICH WAS ALSO RECEIVING THE INFORMATION. NOT UNTIL THE AIRLINER WAS A FEW MILES FROM THE VALERA AIRPORT HAD THE RADIO RESUMED NORMAL OPERATION.

BOTH FLYERS TOLD REPORTERS THEY HAD NEVER BELIEVED IN FLYING SAUCERS.

*BUT NOW*, SAID CAPTAIN [REDACTED], *NOT ONLY ARE WE CONVINCED OF THEIR EXISTENCE, BUT ALSO THAT THEY ARE CONTROLLED.* THEN HE ADDED, *THIS WAS THE MOST SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF MY CAREER AS A PILOT, AND I WILL REMEMBER THE INCIDENT FOREVER.*

THE PILOTS' DETAILED REPORT, WHICH MADE FRONT-PAGE HEADLINES, WAS FULLY CONFIRMED BY THE PASSENGERS.

Here is the text from the document:

Brilliant meteors of a particularly fragile structure, which seldom deposit recoverable fragments, are common in February. Unsurprisingly, this month has also produced many fantastic UFO reports. According to various saucer publications, for example, in the nights between February 2 and February 14, 1955, the skies were thick with weird machines from beyond the earth.

On February 2 at 11:15 A.M. an airliner flying over Venezuela observed a phenomenon described as "a strange round apparatus flying swiftly toward the plane. Rotating counterclockwise, the mysterious machine shone with a greenish light. Around its center was a red ring or band which emitted flashes of brilliant light. Above and below this band were lighted portholes." [2, p. 24a] As the pilot banked the plane, the object whirled downward, leveled off, and raced away at tremendous speed. The flyers told reporters that although they had never believed in flying saucers, they now were convinced of their existence and of their being controlled. After excavating the few specific facts buried in these dramatic interpretations, we recover a classic description of an ordinary daytime fireball: a flaming red body surrounded by greenish gases, breaking up into fragments that burn up in a brilliant flash. Three nights later, on February 5, the ocean liner Vera Cruz (time and position not stated) supposedly reported that a "huge, luminous craft, cruising at fantastic speed," had passed above the ship [2, p. 250]. On the night of February 7 the pilot of an Eastern Airlines flight over Florida saw what "looked like a ball of fire, ten or fifteen feet in diameter"; three similar objects "much brighter than aircraft flares" were sighted in the same area between 7:55 and 8:35 P.M. [2, p. 255]. On February 11 a Pan American flight between Miami and New York (time and position not given) was passed by "two strange, reddish-green objects." [2, p. 259] On February 14 shortly before midnight a swiftly moving "weird" green fireball was seen from Texas to Mississippi, so blindingly brilliant that it lighted up a whole room [2, p. 260].

Not one of these descriptions provides enough factual information to allow positive identification, but every one fits the usual meteor pattern. It is highly probable that all these "UFOS" were merely meteors.

Venezuela is written at the bottom of the page.

The Christchurch Star-Sun, Monday, Feb. 7, 1955]

Coasters
Startled by
Meteorite

D.C. GREYMOUTH, Today.
Excitement ran high in many
parts of the Coast yesterday
at an object which made a brief
flight through the sky and
caused a noise like a thunderclap shortly before a sound like the
low rumble of thunder occurred.
It was, nevertheless, distinct
and many people were left with
the impression that the ground
trembled with it. They noticed
that the object had been disintegrated on reaching the earth's
atmosphere at some point over
the Coast. It is possible the percussion could have caused shockwaves in the atmosphere which
might have been felt and could
have given out the rumble reported from many widely separated districts.

Observation Difficult
It seems that people some
miles south of Greymouth who
were looking in the direction of
sight, glowing with a bright silver light, and who saw it move
beyond their vision, did not hear
any subsequent noise which was
generally heard in the north.

It was pointed out today that
observers to pick the altitude of
a highly-up object or to estimate speed.

Meteorites are not uncommon
sights on the Coast, but are
mainly seen at night.

It is thought that perhaps
meteorite was larger than the
usual size of such objects that
have been visible in daylight.

Very few meteorites ever
reach the earth's surface, though
there is a record of three or four
having done so, including one
which landed on a house in the
Westport district within the past
few months.

Attitude 100,000ft
He is a former pilot, and he
put its altitude at not less than
100,000ft.

After moving high in the air
it exploded in a puff of smoke
it looked like a jet rocket
moving rapidly in the sky.

This report does not positively any suggestion that the
object approached close to the
ground or that part of it came
to earth in the foothills. The
report also places the object in
the area in which it was seen
with Lake Brunner.

Many who did not see any
object in the sky nevertheless
heard an explosion which is
judged to have followed the disappearance.

Some witnesses, fishermen,
sportsmen in Greymouth, Rotomanu, Tapanui, and even Westport
heard the noise. It very closely
resembled a long roll of thunder,
not particularly loud or sharp.

FLASH' ALSO
SIGHTED AT
ASHBURTON

D.C. ASHBURTON, Today.
At least three reputable
business men in Ashburton today reported seeing what they
described as a "very brilliant
light" high in the Southern
travelling towards the sky.
The sighting of the object, or
light, which, according to one
of the observers, was travelling
at a phenomenal speed, came
about 5 p.m. and was like a
"mysterious explosion" reported from West Coast centres
yesterday afternoon.

One of the business men said
that he was in the main street
when he saw a bright flash in
the sky above the Alps. At
though he drew the attention of
his companions to the "flash,"
they did not see it.

Magnesium Flare
It was like a bright magnesium flare, he said this morning. "It seemed to go right up
into the sky. It was falling
towards the hills."

Another man reported seeing
a "very bright light" travelling
in the western sky above the
Alps at 4.50 p.m. yesterday. It
appeared to be travelling at a
high speed in what appeared to
be a north-westerly direction. He was unable to estimate
its height and was not able to
identify its shape accurately this
morning.

A third observer reported that
he saw a "bright light" in the
sky in the Southern Alps at
about 5 p.m. yesterday. He did
not take a great deal of notice
of it until he read this morning
of the "explosion" on the West
Coast.
