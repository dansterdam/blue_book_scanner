The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from a Project Blue Book record card. The card contains various fields for recording information about a UFO sighting, such as the location, date, time, type of observation, number of objects, and a brief summary. The only information filled in on this particular card is the location "Mexico" and the comment "From American Consulate".

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

AIR REPORT PHOTO DATA REPORT 2-8000PS MARCH 1950 REPORT OF INVESTIGATION 1. This investigator was called to investigate a report of a flying object observed by an unidentified observer near Azadnomis, Mexico on August 8, 1952.  The object was first observed at approximately 1800 hours local time on that date and was observed by the informant for approximately 10 minutes.  The informant reported that the object was circular in shape, emitted a bright white light, and appeared to change colors according to the informant.  The object was reported to have made no noise and was observed to maneuver in the sky in an unusual manner. The informant reported that during the observation the object appeared to increase in size and then decrease in size before finally disappearing from sight. 2.  This investigator interviewed the informant and obtained a complete description of the observed object and the circumstances surrounding the observation.  The informant's report appears to be reliable and truthful.  Since no further evidence or information is available and no physical evidence was recovered, this case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.  The informant's report is attached as an enclosure to this report.

THE FOREIGN SERVICE 
OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Address Official Communications to
AMERICAN EMBASSY, VENERABLE AUGUST 29, 1952.

The Honorable  
William O'Dwyer,
American Ambassador, 
American Embassy,
Mexico, D.F.

Sir:

Reference is made to the Embassy's Airgram No. 423, dated March 19, 1952 (Embassy File No. 123), on the subject "Flying Discs". In compliance with the provisions of that circular, the following information is given:

The Veracruz morning daily "El Dictamen" reported in today's edition (August 29) that during last night (night before last) there was seen yesterday over the city. It is stated that the disc was larger and flew lower than those seen in other parts. The report is translated:

A flying plate blue-green in color and of an uncommon size discovered the sky over Veracruz yesterday morning at 2:10 a.m. with a tremendous speed. Several persons saw it pass over a house in the city and it gave the impression that it was just like the moon when this is in its fourth phase in mid-sky.

The variations given here by these same persons who saw the flying plate is very important because it adds new data to those already received in reference to these strange phenomena which seemingly have no satisfactory theory to explain them.

Our informants agree that the flying plate's passage was marked by a blinding court, clearly perceptible, very similar to that made by a high voltage transformer when it is illuminating the load.

The trajectory of the flying plate was from northwest to southeast and lasted over Veracruz in eight seconds before losing itself in the sea. Even after it had disappeared the blinding could be heard and there remained a curious greenish reflection.

Performing OCR on the text:

The persons who saw the flying plate are very sensible and their opinions merit consideration. Their story which adheres strictly to their observations:

At 2:15 in the morning some persons who were in the street outside their houses or strolling, noticed an extraordinary object in the sky. This object made a very intense whistling sound, moving at a terrific speed, making it appear as very close. As soon as it approached, it produced a very strong light which illuminated the entire area near the persons who observed it. They noticed that the object was circular in shape and had in the center a kind of cupola from which emanated the brilliant light. The object was moving in a zigzag motion and at a very low altitude.

The light of the flying plate was of a soft intensity, such as that produced by a neon gas tube, and in the center there was a circle of bright light much more intense that the rest, which could have been a glass or a transparent shell. The strange body performed no evolutions, but that disappeared at a terrific speed.

In so far as we know, only the watchman of the refinery at
Pajaritos had informed that the passage of the plate was accompanied by a whistling sound characteristic of a jet plane in flight, about which nothing more is known.

In the case of Poza Rica, simultaneously with the blinding light there were some phenomena in the high tension wires and in the illumination of the oil refineries.

It is almost certain that the plate which passed over this area presented is one of those which have been seen, but at a lower altitude. In all parts of the world, numerous reports of flying plates and the like continue.

As data which may be important for the investigations which are being carried out, we inform you that according to the depth of the horizon there was seen a shadow indicating a quite strong and constant displacement of the same.

The department informs that to this office and the staff is known or say anything of this phenomenon. We have been very careful not to give any pretention of sensationalism. This Meteorological Spanish Expedition could not obtain any data, because the place of occurrence was from northwest to southeast, and sixty kilometers away from the place of the observers. However, the matter is reported for what it may be worth.
