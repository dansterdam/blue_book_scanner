UFO Sightings, State of Washington

SAFOI-3d (Maj L. J. Tucker)

1. It was brought to the attention of ATIC by Congressman ████, that during July and August of 1959, there were a number of sightings of unidentified flying objects in the areas of Bremerton, Yakima, Bellingham, and Hoquiam, Washington.

2. These objects were described as red, green, white, blue, and yellow by the various witnesses, all sighting occurring at night.

3. ATIC contacted the 25th Air Division, McChord AFB, Washington and requested an investigation of these sightings. The Directorate of Intelligence of the 25th Air Division informed ATIC on 15 September 1959, that these lights resulted from flares emanating from friendly sources. A telephone call to the base commander, McChord AFB, Washington determined that these friendly sources were SAC aircraft conducting a refueling mission in the area.

4. It is requested that Congressman Towlessen be informed of our findings concerning these sightings. It is requested that the letter be addressed to:

Mrs ████
Congressman ████
6th District
Washington State

FOR THE COMMANDER:

PHILIP G. EVANS
