FROM OUTER SPACE? — Times Reporter Dewey Hills by Importer Robert Balzer, Saucer provided ex-

Spice to Gloria's Night
Actress Swanson Treks to Hills for Look
at Disk After Exciting Half-Hour on TV

A TV interviewer watching This Is Your Life Wednesday
night would have guessed that Actress Gloria Swanson
was excited about a flying saucer as she graciously
paused to chat with a reporter about her colorful career during the pro-

Road.

The saucer story started
Wednesday morning after
Miss Swanson learned indi-
rectly that she was to be
Ralph Edwards' surprise
guest on "This is Your Life"
and would appear, nevertheless, despite the show's pre-
cious that demands secrecy.

Saucerites Sees
Robert Balzer, wealthy food
importer and close friend
of the actress, told her a star-
tling story he had learned
from a pilot friend. It was
of a dying saucer that had
landed in the hills. As such
it had been seen. he was
told, then disappeared after
jerking instruments from the
cockpit.

Balzer took Miss Swanson
to the scene and there, indeed, was the saucer. Pan-
Covered with a shallow hole
that was pulled aside, the disk
was made of aluminum, with
no scent of its tubing along
the opening. There
cockpit was unlined, a center
electric leatherette and
two cords dangled down
toward wooden flooring.

Doughnutlike Wheels
Protruding into the muddy
hole from the base of the
craft was a tricycle-like
doughnut arrangement with
three wheels. The organizer
and the actress remained at
the scene just long
enough for him to take pictures of Miss Swanson with
the saucer, then returned to

Early 1957: Palm Springs, Calif.— Would confirm and has other sightings of a formation of five UFOs while unloading via from a well-known near the east city limits. The UFOs, operating on our civil airline, held a perfect formation as they passed directly overhead. They flew out of sight in about 3 hours, the time was about 11:00 a.m. and the day was very clear.

January 1957, Florida- Donald Prestone, master mechanic, at G.O.S. reported that while testing weather radar equipment, he picked up a mysterious flying object that played aerial tag for several minutes before disappearing in space at 7,000 feet. Prestone said the object was four or five times larger than any aircraft he had over seen on radar.

It first appeared about 65 miles S W of Miami at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

Because the object had a definite shape and moved on a definite course, Prestone doesn't think it was a freak return on the radarscope.

FIREBALL OF 1957 JANUARY 17
A.M.S. No. 2367
P. F. LOGAN and C. P. OLIVIER

On this date at about 6:45 p.m. a spectacular fireball appeared over Oregon, went roughly N.N.W., and ended over British Columbia. Immediately after its appearance, F. X. Brogan, A.M.S. regional director of the Region, made efforts to secure reports, both through newspapers and by personal contact. In all, 13 which appear to belong to this body were obtained, 11 by him, 2 by the Messrs. Steinmeyer of Buhl, Idaho. Most of the reports are incomplete, partly due to some observers being in cars or indoors.

The fireball's color, reported by 5 was blue, green or white, or a combination of these colors. There is no specific estimate of brightness or angular size except "large". However, one in a newspaper, of unknown origin, stated that its diameter was half that of the moon. An aviator reported seeing it from Nevada but, as usual, with no confirmation. Many aviators, who most know what altitudes and bearing are, practically never give them as a mystery? Only 4 persons attempted to give the altitude of beginning point and 6 its azimuth. From these latter a roughly determined orbit beginning point is found and an even less certain height. Hi for beginning point.

The subradiant point is based on 6 approximately good, and 3 confirmatory estimates. The stations were all far to the north and their maximum deviation is end point is only 5°. A single good Canadian observation would have been very valuable. As to the end height, Hi was have 11 altitudes, and one confirmatory. Fifth and other distinctive heights, which the fireball disappeared had to be allowed for, with consequent uncertainty. However, one does not wish to discard many reports made in good faith and some with considerable trouble, so a solution is made, which in the best we can derive from inadequate data. As gathered, these reports were all gathered by Brogan except the 2 in Idaho. No orbit is prepared the observations and make a preliminary chart. The final solution was made by Olivier. It is obvious that the heights here derived are much greater than usual for fireballs, but they are what the data offer. However, the one observation which gives a point on the path, though it is referred to the Pointers, gives an impossibly great height, and unfortunately can not be used as a check, as we usually do. Due to the great uncertainty in Hi, no orbit is calculated. The usual radius follows.

RECENT SIGHTING REPORTS

DIAMOND-SHAPED FORMATION OVER BINGHAMTON, NEW YORK

January 25, 1957: CSI member Mrs. of Binghamton, New York, sent us the details of a personal observation made at 6:35 a.m. on January 25. She saw four white lights in the southeast quadrant, traveling slowly east parallel to the horizon and 6 to 8 degrees above it, in a diamond-shaped formation. "The sky was overcast, so that the lights were diffused at times the lights at the front and rear of the formation flashed brighter." They were in sight for about ten minutes, and were then lost in the thick overcast. As they moved away to- ward the east, the lights became less bright, but did not diminish in size. Mrs. was quite certain that they could not be planes because of the intensity of the front and rear lights.

NORTH ANDOVER HAS NOCTURNAL INTRUDER

January 28, 1957: CSI member of North Andover, Massachusetts, describes in detail an observation by his father. At 10:15 p.m. Mr. had put his car in the garage and was walking to the house when he saw "an object giving off a light blue luminescence..." in a shallow climb and traveling at a speed approximately that of a fast jet plane." The object was circular and appeared to be slightly larger than a basketball." Its distance was estimated to be slightly more than a half-mile away and its estimated altitude was 1,500 to 2,000 feet. No structural detail was seen. The object was silent and left no trail. Visibility was good, with scattered clouds at about 20,000 feet.

There was no moon and only a very slight wind.

"The UFO was traveling west to east and seemed to be rapidly spinning, like a child's top in motion." Its speed seemed to increase as it traveled away from the viewer. Growing smaller, it finally went out of sight. Mr. had watched it for about 30 seconds.

Gentlemen:

Recently our organization has undertaken an investigation of some strange material which apparently fell from the sky into a residential New Jersey community.

I have enclosed a resume' of the case. Because the material looks somewhat like melted porcelain, ceramic, or glass, with drops of melted copper-like material included in it, my mind connected it with recent information I have come upon, about government experiments with high-temperature re-entry cones on missiles.

A ceramic nose-cone, as I understand it, coated with a thin sheet of copper or coprous alloy would withstand high temperatures during re-entry, as the copper melted and evaporated, thus cooling the ceramic, which could then withstand the temperatures at lower altitudes by itself.

I should like to know if the material described briefly herein could, in your opinion, be attributed to any such experiments, if such activities have indeed been conducted by your agency or any other department.

Please accept my apologies...I realize this is a rather vague request. But I felt if such experiments have been conducted, your office would know, and would further know if the area or results are to be connected in any way with U. S. missile activity.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]

About ten years ago I saw a U.F.O.
It happened like this.

My family & I were up near mount
Pleasant up visiting my now late father
& this family. Everyone was asleep except
Dad & I. Dad had to after his wife,
a nurse in Mt. Pleasant and asked me
if I wanted to come keep him company.
I went.

Well we had just topped a
hill when I saw it. It was so close


- page 20 -

I thought it was going to hit the car. I was about to ask Brad if he saw it, but before I could it had disappeared.

I neither saw it nor any other UFO since.

When I saw it I thought it might be been Sputnik I. It had just been launched about one month before I saw the UFO.

If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Sincerely yours,

To Case Info Only

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted], 22 March 1957

Dear Miss [redacted]:

This replies to your letter of March 22, 1957 in which you mentioned an unidentified observation you made in approximately 1957.

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date, it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that an individual report his or her observation as soon as possible. This enables Air Force analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation.

Your interest in the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects is appreciated.
