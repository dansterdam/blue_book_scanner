from a pilot that this distance would be

It is just impossible for me to estimate any

derive of the total charged time we viewed
the object, and I feel short was the time it
was combined motionless after its position
came in 30-50 minutes, then it lies some
time for it to see how the view it into the
total eye to which it was clearly visible. It

was while rising it this way that it was
given was clearly visible. These particulars were
still given from 2 1/2 G. The appearance which was
definitely visible to the naked eye appeared to
have two pictures attached to it when views

explosion came from them. These explosions
appeared as hazy of triple evidence. There
was no indication of sparks.

APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

In accordance with Air Force Letter 200-3 dated 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) A single disc-shaped object was observed approaching due North by Northwest, Texas. Object appeared immense to observers but no estimation of size could be given. Object was sighted approximately ten miles distance in downtown San Antonio, Colored estimated a circular, spinning, silver color, descending by observers at 1000 feet. When first sighted, object appeared to be spherical in shape but after object clipped about, it gave base appearance of a colored disc. Immediately object was lost to view.

Two witnesses made very close observation. This picture was always visible, even when object performed dipping maneuvers. Observers could see distinct details which appeared to be some type of explosions in the form of balls of fire emitted. Object approached in a straight line then moved laterally a short distance. Object was really then clearly visible, almost directly overhead of observers. Object hovered motionless in this position for twenty minutes then changed to a gradual descent until no longer visible.

(2) Object first sighted 0015 hours, Central Standard Time. Length of time observed one hour and twenty minutes.

(3) A visual ground observation with binoculars was made.

(4) Observers were at residence of Mrs [redacted], San Antonio, Texas at the time of the sighting. Object was in the South sky bearing approximately 330 degrees. Distance was estimated and altitude calculated as much higher than forty thousand feet.

(5) Reliability of observers unknown.

(6) Fair weather prevailed at the time of the sighting.

(7) No meteorological explanation for the sighting.

(8) No physical evidence of sighting.

(9) No interception or identification action taken.

(10) Location of any air traffic in the general area at the time of the sighting unknown.

STATEMENT

At approximately 0915 hours, Central Standard Time, 16 July 1952, I was in my garden conversing with my neighbor, Mrs. [redacted], when I observed a round object rise from the south sky. This object appeared to be the same size as the dome of the transit tower. The object at first gave the impression of being a commercial advertisement being towed by an airplane and I didn't give much immediate thought so I continued my conversation with Mrs. [redacted].

Presently a jet aircraft flew over and we began looking for the jet plane. We were joined at this time by my daughter, [redacted]. While looking for the jet plane we noticed that the object had risen on the horizon to a point of about a forty-five degree angle. Mrs. [redacted] left at this time to call another neighbor, Mrs. [redacted] to see the object. We watched it until it had traveled to a point of about a seventy degree angle. At this time I entered the house to report the object to Kelly AF Base. My daughter observed object through eight-power binoculars and noticed that the object moved East a very short distance then West and hovered a few minutes. Then the object headed North again until it was almost at mid-sky at which time it hovered approximately twenty minutes, neither moving nor performing maneuvers. The object then began to rise gradually until it was no longer visible even with the binoculars.

The object appeared to be of metallic construction and emitted


- page 6 -

a brilliant white light, not unlike burning magnesium. At first the object appeared spherical with a pendulum-like apparatus fixed to the underside, giving the illusion of a parachute with a man hanging from it. Two bulb-like knobs were attached in-line on the pendulum-like apparatus from which explosions emitted, especially noticeable when the object flipped around. This pendulum was visible at all times even when performing the flipping maneuver. When the object flipped around, it appeared to be more flattened, somewhat similar to the planet Saturn, except it was longer and more spread out.

As to relation of size with known objects, we observed a jet aircraft fly beneath the object and even though the object was much higher than the plane, the object appeared to be as large as the jet.

The plane was estimated to be flying at between thirty-five and forty thousand feet.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

I certify that I was present at this sighting and that the facts presented hereon are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Regarding No. 19: This is difficult for me to describe. The distance from our house, 5 1/2 miles to the south, is clearly visible from our house. This dome is approximately 50 feet in diameter. When I first saw the object it appeared just above the horizon to the left of this dome by the transit tower and was slightly by larger at this point. My attention was distracted for a few seconds and by this time the object had risen and began to diminish slowly in size. When it reached about a 45° angle, with the horizon the object retained the size it was at that point. Some remained some until it began to recede, when it gradually diminishing while it comes to larger size. I can't see it will be circular.

Regarding No. 20: Frankly, I do not know how to write the details you ask for, however, while I was telling to the operators at Kelly, I...
