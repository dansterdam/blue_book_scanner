Text output:

which this letter was received and in regard to the sight of a formation of so-called discs of lights which were seen hovering over the same field. I understand that this matter was quite unusual and I would appreciate for one to investigate in every way possible just what was behind it. The details were that three or four of the discs of light were seen hovering for several minutes and then quickly disappeared. The sequence of the lights seemed to be somewhat irregular and had no pattern that could be discerned. Of course. The sequence and maneuverability to the discs has long been a subject of interest as well as considerable speculation in circles interested in the phenomenon. Indeed the information contained in your letter seems to be quite typical of many sightings reported over the years. There are no apparent inconsistencies and the report appears to be straightforward and objective. I would of course appreciate any further details that you might be able to provide regarding this sighting just what was observed in your own words and an indication of the reliability of the witness or witnesses. This would be of great value in evaluating the report. There was no indication of any photographic evidence being available. If you have any such evidence I would certainly be interested in examining it. In any event. I appreciate your calling this to my attention and I will be glad to pursue the matter further with you if you care to provide any additional information.

The image appears to be a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book document. It does not contain any photographs, but rather consists of text describing a sighting of an unidentified object.

The text reads as follows:

STATEMENT

At approximately 0315 hours, Central Standard Time, 15 July 1952, I was in my garden conversing with my neighbor. This object, when I observed it, appeared to be the same size as the dome of the transit tower. The object at first gave the impression of being a conventional aircraft, being round in shape and I didn't give much immediate thought as I continued my conversation with him.

Presently a jet aircraft flew over and I began looking for the jet plane. While looking for the jet plane I noticed that the object had risen to a position in the heavens to a point where it was difficult to determine whether the object had flown higher or had remained in a fixed position. I decided at this time to call another neighbor, Mrs. ------ to see the object. We watched it until it had traveled to a point of disappearance. At this time I entered the house to inform my daughter of the sighting. My daughter observed the object through eight-power binoculars and noticed that the object moved East a very short distance then remained motionless until it was almost at mid-night at which time it hovered for approximately twenty minutes, neither moving nor performing maneuvers.

The object then seemed to be no longer visible even with the binoculars.

The object appeared to be of metallic construction and emitted a light even with the binoculars.

- page 6 -

The image appears to contain a photograph showing a bright white object, not unlike a burning magnesium flare, at the center of the frame. The object is described as appearing to be surrounded by a parachute-like apparatus. The text indicates that the object was observed flying beneath a jet aircraft, and that it appeared to be much larger than the plane. No humans are directly identified in the image.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
I certify that I was present at this sighting and that the facts presented herein are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

There is a photograph present in the image, which appears to be a black-and-white document or report page. The photograph shows an unidentified flying object (UFO) or aerial phenomenon. The text below the image provides a detailed description of the observed object and its movement.

[Sketch of an object's path]
more from usntain horizon is still quite low to the ground. The object rose very rapidly to much higher altitudes, moving in a vertical plane. I could not tell wheher it was round or oval, as the details were indistinct at the distance it was observed. It seemed rather small in appearance but I cannot estimate its actual size or distance. The sighting lasted only about 30 seconds from first to last sight. It was observed against a clear sky.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

29. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One): Yes or No
29.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One): Yes or No 
29.2 Please list their names and addresses:
Mra. Dkill:.,
Mrs. S. M. Canning, 4 years old, San Antonio, Texas.

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. Use additional sheets of the same size paper if necessary.
Regarding the object, it seemed to be about 5 to 6 miles distant traveling slowly in a south westerly direction. This dame is confirmed in every detail by my wife, who was also a witness. She corroborates the observation of this craft in every respect. My attention was first drawn to it by a peculiar whirring sound which seemed to emanate from the object. As it traveled across the sky, I noticed it was surrounded by a faint glow or luminescence. It was traveling at a moderate speed and disappeared from sight in several minutes. The strange craft did not resemble any type of aircraft with which I am familiar. My attention was riveted on the object for a few seconds and by this time it had traveled a considerable distance. When I first observed it, it appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length. It became smaller as it traveled away. Throughout the observation, there was no evidence of wings, propellers, or any other usual aircraft characteristics. The only sound I heard was the faint whirring noise mentioned previously. I am unable to offer any satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon. I am accustomed to observing aircraft of all types and this sighting was definitely out of the ordinary. I would appreciate any information you could provide regarding unidentified aerial craft of this nature.
