Source: Yeoman 3d Class [redacted], Pearl Harbor, T.H.

1. On 16 January 1951, Yeoman [redacted] observed an unusual flying object in the air. Interrogation of Yeoman Williams by the 1200th Air Base Intelligence Officer revealed the following facts:

2. At 0600 local time, 16 January 1953, while proceeding on Nimitz Highway in the city of Honolulu, Yeoman [redacted] suddenly sighted a bright, highly illuminated circular object moving at a high rate of speed over the Pearl Harbor area for about 2 brief to three minutes. Reason for sighting object.

3. The object was moving in a north-south direction in a straight line parallel to the earth and then made a 90 turn and moved out of sight in a westerly direction. The size of the object, its speed or its altitude could not be determined by Yeoman [redacted]. There were no clouds, trails, smoke or propulsion evidence noted. The Yeoman stated that he has had considerable experience in observing jet aircraft and believes that what he saw was not a conventional aircraft. Weather conditions at time of sighting were clear; wind was about 5 knots and aloft conditions were very light with winds at about 6 knots per hour.

COMMENT: A check with U.S. weather bureau revealed that no weather balloons were released at the time of this sighting. Base Operations at Hickam and other military installations had no record of any aircraft in the area at that time. No substantiating reports from other military and civilian agencies were received which would confirm the above description.
