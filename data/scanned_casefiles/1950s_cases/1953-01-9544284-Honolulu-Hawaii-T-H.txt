Transcribed text from the document:

TN-101-33
SUBJECT: Pearl Harbor.

1. On 10 January 1953, Yeoman      observed an unusual "flying object" in the air during the observation of several Williams by the LORAN Air Base.

2. The object was first noticed at about 11:00 pm, 9 January 1953, while proceeding on a routine aircraft inspection mission. The object was sighted in the vicinity of the radar scope at the LORAN Air Base. The object appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed, much faster than any aircraft seen in the area before. The object was oval in shape and appeared to be luminous. It was estimated to be about 30 to 40 feet long and 8 to 10 feet wide. The object was seen for a period of about 5 minutes.

3. The object was moving in a north-south direction, in a straight line and at a constant speed. The object could not be tracked on the radar scope. It was reported that the object was not a star, planet, or aircraft of any kind. The object could not be identified.

PRESENT: A check with the U.S. Weather Bureau revealed that the weather conditions as existing at the time of the sighting were normal. There were no unusual meteorological phenomena reported.
