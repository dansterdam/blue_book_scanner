"Pilotos 'encontraram' "Disco Voador" sobre o Pacífico"
SAN FRANCISCO, 14 (UPI) - Um piloto da Pan-American Airways declara que ele e outros membros da tripulação de um avião que voava a 1.600 metros de altura, entre São Francisco e Honolulu, avistaram na última segunda-feira um fenômeno que parece corresponder ao que é conhecido como "disco voador".
Segundo a declaração do piloto, o objeto parecia ter cerca de 15 a 20 metros de diâmetro e brilhava intensamente. Ele flutuava a uma altura de aproximadamente 800 metros durante cerca de 12 a 15 minutos, quando de repente desapareceu, aparentemente a grande velocidade.
O piloto, cujo nome não foi revelado, disse que o fenômeno ocorreu a aproximadamente 600 milhas de São Francisco, no Oceano Pacífico. Ele acrescentou que outros pilotos e passageiros a bordo do avião também viram o objeto.

Podem outros dois pilotos
Pouco depois, outros dois pilotos de avião da mesma companhia aérea também declararam ter visto um objeto semelhante, nas mesmas condições e aproximadamente na mesma área. O capitão Noel Newschwander, da Canadian Pacific Airlines, disse que ele e seu co-piloto também observaram o fenômeno, que duraria cerca de 10 a 12 minutos.

PILOTS MEAN WITH THE "FLYING DISCS" OVER THE PACIFIC

San Francisco, 13 (UPI) - A pilot of the Pan American Airways informed that his aircraft, a, passener group of four brilliant lights approached his aircraft at great speed over the Pacific and then disappeared suddenly.

Several four other pilots of aviation enterprises which operate over the Pacific also inform that they have seen unidentified objects.

A local spokesman of the Pan American Airways said that the first notice was given by Captain [redacted], pilot of a passenger aircraft DC-7 when he was flying between San Francisco and Honolulu at about 8:30 in the morning about time.

"They were very brilliant lights surrounded by lesser lights," the pilot said, and he added, "The approach of the object took place when we were flying at about 8,400 meters altitude. Immediately the set of lights disappeared to the south. After some ten seconds all the lights had disappeared." He finished by saying that the phenomenon had occurred at about 7:02 Pacific time. "At that time we were M 1.350 km from Honolulu," he added.

The third pilot of the Pan American Airways who saw the lights was Captain [redacted] who left San Francisco for Honolulu a half an hour before.

The spokesman for the Pan American Airways also said that the pilot of a passenger aircraft of the Canadian Pacific Airlines and a pilot of the-Canada cargo transportation enterprise. Both were on the way to Honolulu.

OCR Output:
A similar sighting, which saucer enthusiasts have publicized as a brilliantly lighted UFO that appeared to hold a definite course, occurred at 3:22 a.m. on July 31, 1959. As over the North Pacific from Hawaii to the West Coast of the United States, it was reported that a mysterious bright object accompanied at its left by four smaller lights had appeared. This plane, at "unconventional speed," made a sharp turn and the pilot, who had never seen anything like it in all his years of flying, told the newspapers, "I'm a believer."

The official investigation began immediately. Four other commanding officers had reported seeing the object at the same time. In each case, the pilot stated that the objects seemed to head straight at his plane at a high speed on a collision course, then suddenly disappear. The various reports, however, showed significant disagreements. Some witnesses gave the color as white, some as orange-yellow. Of the several pilots, each gave a different degree of brilliancy and disappearance. The maneuvers were described as consisting of a big light surrounded by a cluster of six or seven smaller lights, the whole formation flying at the left, a big light followed by four smaller lights in the form of a rectangle formed by four smaller lights. Of the five pilots who reported official reports, one said the phenomenon was definitely not a meteor, and two did not venture an opinion. The pilots of several other flights on routes too far distant, they too had seen the object, but had not reported it. They assumed it to be a meteor.

After mapping and correlating all the observations, ATIC concluded that the object had pursued the course of July 31 route quickly and efficiently. The inference was that the object was a highly efficient piece of work, demonstrating some highly advanced science techniques in the field of aeronautics that are perfectly into the meteor pattern. Pointing to this list of distinguishing flying objects, some believe that these UFOs are actually space machines, which are now beginning to be so numerous and actual they can no longer be ignored.

The image contains a newspaper article with the headline "Airline Pilots See Mystery Lights". The article describes a report from an airline pilot who witnessed what he described as a "terrified object" or a "bright light" while flying over Honolulu, Hawaii. The article mentions that four other transpacific airlines reported similar sightings around the same time, but does not contain any photographs.

THE INDIANAPOLIS STAR
VETERAN FLIER VISITS HANSEN
Airline Pilots See Mystery Lights
Honolulu (UPD) The Pan American Airline's First Officer of a Chicago-bound luxury liner reported that his plane approached his Airlines at 3:11 a.m. I.L.T. yesterday as the object appeared.
Four other transpacific airline pilots reported seeing similar mysterious flying objects at approximately the same time.
The pilot who made the first report was Captain William J. Nash, a 19-year flying veteran. He was flying a regular Pan Am run from San Francisco to Honolulu when, at 8:11 a.m. I.L.T. (8 a.m. e.s.t.) "one in- tensely bright white light" appeared off the starboard wing of his plane.
Nash said the light was in clear view below us when the example of stars good forma tion disappeared moving at an extremely high rate of speed 600 feet above us and to our left.
"The object appeared to be approx imately 40 to 60 feet in diameter and was saucer-shaped," Nash said. "It had a definite metallic luster and made absolutely no sound. It was like the old story you hear - a flying saucer.' My co-pilot Bob Gallagher and I were astounded at what we saw."
WILSON, VISIBLY SHAKEN, admitted this was the first time in 19 years of flying the Pacific that he had ever witnessed such a strange object.
"I'm a definite Disbeliever now," he said.
All other Honolulu-bound airlines in the area at the time reported similar sightings, "almost simultaneously," Nash said.
"Suddenly the object made a sharp right turn -a maneuver which we know of and the flight surgeon immediately dismissed as being impossible for any known aircraft to make," Nash said. "The object then proceeded eastward at a phenomenal rate of speed and was lost to our view."
"This sort of thing just doesn't happen," Nash said. "I have never believed such foreign ob- jects existed - until now."

MEDDELANDE
Från K. GÖSTA REHN
Stockholm 25 A 
SVERIGE

Datum Sept 3. 1959
Via Stockholm

Dear Major Tacker,
I thank you very much for your sending me several recent Fact Sheets and transcript of the TV discussion on the Armstrong Theatre. 
I know how much in trouble you are with the Swedish UFOE Staff which handles UFO-matters and they are in complete disagreement with the US Air Force regarding the investigations and sightings. We simply cannot convince them as well. 
I hesitate to ask you to increase your kind courtesy and favor by sending me the Astronomical - Meteor Journal reported on July 18th 1959 by FAA control tower at Honolulu and the newspaper reports. It would be very nice indeed to have copies of the documents. 
As I stated in my previous request, my experience is somewhat different. We have been having camped together in various offices before the war. He is a major authority and really knows me very well.
Sincerely yours,
K. GÖSTA REHN

To indicate that even experienced observers may, under the strain of excitement, make errors in reporting, the moon although quite bright moonlight, however, the moon indicates did not being a factor indicating that there were traces of some other object in the sky. Captain reportedly a meteor. It is concluded that the object responsible for this sighting was probably a "fireball".
