The rest of the text is partially illegible or cut off. The image appears to be a newspaper clipping with a black and white photograph showing four individuals standing together, seemingly in athletic or sports attire.

On the left side of the document, there is a handwritten note that appears to include some numbers and text, but it is not fully clear.

Pilotos encontraram "Disco Voador" sôbre o Pacifico

SÃO FRANCISCO, 13 (UPI) - Um piloto da Pan American Airways informou que esta manhã um grupo de luzes sumariamente brilhantes se aproximou de seu avião de passageiros a grande velocidade, sôbre o Pacífico, e em seguida desapareceu bruscamente. Outros quatro pilotos de empresas aéreas que fazem o serviço sobre o Pacífico também informaram haver visto o objeto não identificado.

Um porta-voz local, da Pan-American Airways, disse que a primeira notícia foi dada pelo capitão George Wilson, piloto de um DC-7 que voava entre São Francisco e Honolulu às 6h 20m da manhã, local.

Eram luzes extremamente brilhantes, rodeadas por luzes menores, digo a silhueta, e acrescentou: "Não havia nenhuma dúvida de que o fenômeno ocorreu às 6.602 metros de altura. Imediatamente, parece que o conjunto de luzes desceu um pouco sul. Depois de uma das segundas ondas aéreas, o capitão Nolte, que neste momento nos encontrávamos a 1.500 km de Honolulu, também o viu."

Depõem Outros Dois Pilotos

Pouco depois outros dois pilotos da mesma empresa informaram pelo rádio haver identificado os objetos. O capitão Nolte Sprunger, que se dirigia de Los Angeles a Honolulu, informou que observara os objetos às 6 horas em ponto, mais ao sul do local onde Wilson os havia visto.

O terceiro piloto da Pan-American Airways que viu as luzes foi o capitão E. G. Keller, que também confirmou o relato de Wilson. Pouco mais de uma hora antes que Wilson, o porta-voz da Pan-American disse também que o piloto de um avião de passageiros de uma das empresas de transportes de carga na Silka Airways, anunciaram haver divisado as luzes. Ambos dirigiam a Honolulu.

PILOTS MEAN WITH THE "FLYING DISC" OVER THE PACIFIC

San Francisco, 13 (UPI) A pilot of the Pan American Airways informed that this morning a unusual group of very brilliant lights approached his aircraft at great speed over the Pacific and then disappeared suddenly.

ENOUGH Four other pilots of aviation enterprises which operate over the Pacific also inform that they have seen unidentified objects.

A local spokesman of the Pan American Airways said that the first notice was given by Captain [REDACTED], pilot of a passenger aircraft DC-7 when he was flying between San Francisco and [REDACTED] Honolulu at about 6:20 in the morning local time.

"They were very brilliant lights surrounded by lesser lights," the pilot said, and he added, "The approach of the object took place when we were flying at about 6,400 meters altitude. Immediately the set of lights dimmed disappeared to the south. After some ten seconds all the lights had disappeared." He finished by saying that the phenomenon had occurred at about [REDACTED] 402 Pacific time. "At that time we were at 1,350 km from Honolulu," he added.

The third pilot of the Pan American Airways who saw the lights was Captain [REDACTED] who left San Francisco for Honolulu a half an hour before [REDACTED].

The spokesman for the Pan American Airways also said that the pilot of a passenger aircraft of the Canadian Pacific Air Lines and a pilot of the [REDACTED] cargo transportation enterprise, Slake Airways announce having detected the lights. Both were on the way to Honolulu.

A similar sighting, which saucer enthusiasts have publicized as a brilliantly lighted UFO that appeared to hold a definite course, occurred at 3:02 A.M. on July 11, 1959, also over the Pacific [s.8]. The pilot of a Pan American Airlines flight reported that a mysterious bright object accompanied at its left by four smaller lights had approached his plane at "inconceivable speed," made a sharp right turn, and then disappeared. The objects seemed to be flying evenly spaced in formation, and the pilot, who had never seen anything like it in all his years of flying, told the newspapers, "I'm a believer, now."

The official investigation began immediately. Four other commercial flights had reported seeing the object at the same time. In each case, the pilot stated that the objects seemed to head straight at his plane at high speed on a collision course, then made a go-degree turn and disappeared. The various reports, however, showed significant disagreements. Some witnesses gave the color as white, some as orange-yellow. Of the several pilots, each gave a different description of the "formation": a big light with four smaller lights flying at the left; a big light surrounded by a cluster of six or seven smaller lights; a big light followed by four smaller lights; a big light in the center of a rectangle formed by four smaller lights. Of the five pilots who made official reports, one said the phenomenon was definite; not a meteor, two said it could have been a meteor, and two did not venture an opinion. The pilots of several other flights stated, on landing, that they too had seen the objects but had not radioed a report because they assumed it to be a meteor.

After mapping and correlating all the observations, ATIC completed the analysis and released the result to the press of July 14, only three days after the sighting, a remarkably efficient piece of work. Conclusion: the object was a fireball [20].

The literature of flying saucers contains dozens of similar incidents that fit perfectly into the meteor pattern. Pointing to this list of "unidentified" flying objects, saucer addicts still abuse the Air Force for concealing the "fact" that these UFOs are actually spaceships.

Here is the text from the newspaper article:

THE INDIANAPOLIS STAR                                                July 12, 58

VETERAN FLIER VISIBLY SHAKEN

Airline Pilots See Mystery Lights

Honolulu (UPI) — A Pan American Airways pilot yesterday reported that a mysterious object approached his airliner at "inconceivable" speed early yesterday and then as suddenly disappeared.

Four other transpacific airliner pilots reported sighting unidentified objects.

The pilot who made the first report was Capt. George Wilson, 43 years old, of Seattle, Wash., a 19-year flying veteran. He was flying a DC-7C from San Francisco to Honolulu when, at 3:02 a.m. (CDT), "one intensely bright white light followed by about 1,000 feet of lights" was seen about 1,000 miles east of Honolulu.

"WE WERE cruising at 20,000 feet with low clouds decked below us when the first light appeared. About 1,000 feet above us and to our left.

"My copilot, Richard Lorenzen and my Flight Engineer Robert Scott stared open mouthed as the light came toward us at an extremely high rate of speed. For at least 10 seconds it maintained its course which was on an opposite heading to us and had it been another aircraft it would have passed well to our left.

"Suddenly the object made a sharp right turn at a speed inconceivable of any vehicle we know of and the light suddenly disappeared. The smaller lights were evenly spaced and part of the mysterious object or this was an example of darn good formation flying."

WILSON, VISIBLY shaken, said he had never seen anything like this in his 19 years of flying. He added that he had never believed such foreign objects existed.

"I'm a believer now," he said.

Four other Honolulu-bound airliner pilots made similar reports at approximately the same time.

Att. Major L.J. Tack 97

Dear Major Tacker,

I thank you very much for sending me several recent Fact Sheets and
transmit of the TV discussion on the Armstrong Cheatham.

I have been in touch with the Swedish Defense Staff which handles UFO-
matters and they are in complete agreement with the US Air Force regarding
the problem. As long ago as several recall cause in Sweden too, they as well
as I know been looking into this matter (i being no saucer nut).

I hesitate to ask you to increase your kind courtesy and favor by
sending me the comments you might have on the sighting, reported on July 12th
1959 by PAA Copenhagen, from his flight Frisco to Honolulu.

I have only the newspaper report. It would be very nice indeed to hear of the
outcome.

As I stated in my previous request my reference is [illegible text] the
Presidents appointment secretary at the White House. He knows me very well.
We having camped together in various offices before the war. He is a Major
[illegible text], I think.

To indicate that even experienced observers may, under the strain of excitement, make errors in reporting, Captain [redacted] indicates that it was bright moonlight; however, the moon set at 0330z more than four hours prior to the sighting. Captain [redacted] yet, morning twilight did not begin at his position until 30 minutes after the sighting. Captain [redacted] indicates the object was probably a meteor.

It is concluded that the object responsible for this sighting was probably a "fireball".

Dear Mr.

This acknowledges your letter of 3 September 1959 regarding Unidentified Flying Objects, particularly the July 11 sightings in the Pacific.

These sightings were attributed to an exceptionally bright and large meteor called a "Fire Ball" or "bolide".

Sincerely,
