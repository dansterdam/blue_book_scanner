APPENDIX I
Artesia, New Mexico - 16 January 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On 16 January 1952, two members of a balloon project from the General Mills Aeronautical Research Laboratory and four other civilians observed two unidentified aerial objects in the vicinity of the balloon they were observing. The balloon was at an altitude of 114,000 ft. and was 110 ft. in diameter at the time of the observation.

The objects were observed twice, once from Artesia, New Mexico, and once from the Artesia Airport. In the first instance, one round object appeared to remain motionless in the vicinity, but apparently higher than the balloon. The balloon appeared to be 14 inches in diameter and the object 24 inches in diameter (ratio 3:5) and the color was a dull white. This observation was made by the two General Mills observers.

A short time later the same two observers and four civilian pilots were observing the balloon from the Artesia Airport. Two objects at apparently extremely high altitude were noticed coming toward the balloon from the northwest. They circled the balloon, or apparently so, and flew off to the northeast. The time of observation was about 40 seconds. The two objects were the same color and size as the first objects. They were flying side-by-side. When the objects appeared to circle the balloon, they disappeared and the observers assumed they were disc-shaped and had turned on edge to bank.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

Unfortunately this report was not made until 5 April and did not reach ATIC until 16 April. Due to this time lapse, no further investigation is contemplated. The observers are known to be very reliable and experienced.

III. CONCLUSIONS

None.

the balloon previously allowed at the same altitude (one hundred and ten thousand feet) in an attempt to estimate the direction of movement, and while standing in front of the main hotel in Artesia, N.M. earlier, is observed one (1) object near the location of the balloon. It was then at a point approximately one hundred and sixty (160) degrees in direction and at an elevation of approximately twenty (20) degrees. According to the observer, the first sighting was in the area of the balloon at the elevation of approximately twenty-five (25) degrees. The object was attached the object, which seemed to be coming toward him, until the object reached an elevation of approximately thirty-five (35) degrees. At this time the observer was certain the object was a weather balloon. He stated that he learned later at the airport that no weather balloons had been used that morning. Since he thought that his object was an ordinary weather balloon, he was not continuing, and did not make a vivid impression on him and he could not recall clearly any characteristics concerning this object, adding, however, that generally the characteristics were the same as those of a weather balloon.

He was employed at the time as an Aeronautical Engineering Degree from the University of Minnesota, was a pilot in the Air Force for approximately three (3) years and at the time of the observation was employed as a meteorologist, having worked for over one (1) year. He stated that his job with General Mills, Incorporated at that time consisted mostly of tracking aeronautical research. Will balloons at an altitude of approximately 100,000 feet and was never worn corrective glasses.

AT ARTESIA, NEW MEXICO

2. [Redacted], employee of [redacted] Hills, Incorporated at [redacted], was interviewed 31 March 1952 in connection with the sighting of the (2) unusual objects over [redacted] on 15 January 1952. He stated that he was not in the airport area on 15 January 1952 but determined, after conferring to the Flight 26-study, that, quote, one year prior to this date (16 January 1952) he was in the airport area, quote, and while standing near the airport anticipated his work, quote, New Mexico, when a group of an approximately 1100 hour (sic) civilian aircraft, which suddenly observed in ground track between [redacted] and one thousand (113,000) feet above the airport, stated that he could not recall the name of the present in the group but remembered the group was [redacted].

At this time, [redacted] and the manager of the airport, [redacted] were away, were present. Recalled that while this group of men were observing the balloon, located at approximately 80 (2) degrees, 10 (2) objects appeared in the approximately sixty (60) degrees, to (2) (unrecalled) objects appeared in the sky at an elevation slightly if not approximately eighty-five (85) degrees, and in a first look (2) objects noted in the balloon. Stated at this time that the (2) objects moved in a straight line, having no (2) and matter in the same elevation, so that could not apparently be (40) degrees to the right or left of the balloon. The other witnesses were approximately thirty (30) degrees, and he suddenly disappeared from sight.

According to [redacted], the objects did not seem to move or of significant size. They were sudden, special, with the objects seemingly to be that seemed to be a formation in the one was behind the other. Approximately forty-five (45) degrees from the center of [redacted]. Stated the length of the objects was in flight, quote, about three (3) seconds and stated it could not recall any other characteristics that might be of interest except that the objects seemed to be very well defined and had a definite form. According to [redacted], the objects seemed to be but said that he did not notice any projections. According to [redacted], the objects were about the same relative size as a balloon would be.

Approximately one hundred and ten thousand (110,000) feet, within that close the objects were at a greater angle of elevation, to wit, the balloon was actually to be larger than the balloon. [Redacted] added that on a particular morning he was closer to the objects.

Dear Sir:

On Jan. 17, 1952, between the hours of 1st P.M. and 1:55 P.M., while sitting in my car, I have witnessed a green flash of light in the eastern sky and of Long Island, N.Y.

I was rather hesitant to report this, for fear it might have been a delusion. This includes my psychological outside or inner possibilities, and my unwillingness to write this.

Since my personal observations and recollections of fact is not so satisfactory, I will try to give my reasons on the outside details drawing.

Perhaps you might find this of some interest or value to the safety of our country.

Yours Truly,

SUMMARY:

1. This investigation is predicated upon information contained in a letter from District Office 62, wherein they reported results of an interview with [REDACTED], Aeronautical Research Division, General Mills, Inc., 2010 East Emerson Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota, who reported that while making observations of a balloon they had previously released over Artesia, New Mexico, they noted two (2) unusual objects flying in the vicinity of their test balloon on 16 January 1952.

ARTESIA DETAILS:

2. On 21 March 1952, [REDACTED], manager of Municipal Airport was interviewed with regard to the unconventional aircraft sighting on or about 16 January 1952. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] were present. [REDACTED] stated that the above mentioned group had been observing a balloon that had been released by [REDACTED], but when the balloon was approximately 110 feet in height, the group noticed some disc shaped objects in the same vicinity as the balloon.

[REDACTED] stated he did not know if the objects were above or below the balloon. The first observation was (2) separate objects, each (2) objects, but he received the impression that they were as high or higher than the balloon.

[REDACTED] stated that the balloon was traveling east by five (5) to ten (10) degrees north and that the objects were moving southwest, but the objects never completely stopped, but would slow down and speed up. That when they departed the vicinity of the balloon, they moved at an extremely fast rate of speed, covering an arc of approximately 45 degrees in two (2) to three (3) seconds and disappeared from view. [REDACTED] stated that the objects appeared to be two (2) to three (3) times the size of the balloon, which at that altitude was 110 feet in diameter. That the objects would scatter and then re-group while in the vicinity of the balloon and that when they departed the vicinity of the balloon they left in single file.

[REDACTED] stated that the objects as to size passed between the observer and the balloon. That he is sure these were not conventional aircraft or any known type, as they appeared pale gray in color and left no con-trail or any other visible registration and the only appearance of movement was a slow, steady movement. He got the impression that the objects were convex, although this impression may have been caused by the lack of bright reflection of the sunlight on the objects.

[REDACTED] stated that he was an old pilot of any years, a former pilot of aircraft and has been the manager of the Municipal Airport at Artesia, New Mexico for over five (5) years.

3. On 21 March 1952, [REDACTED], Artesia, New Mexico, manager of Electrical Company, interviewed, stated he was advised that on 16 January 1952, his attention was first drawn to the objects by another member of the group. He stated that he believes the objects were not higher than the balloon.

1. Mr. [REDACTED] Aeronautical Research Division, [REDACTED] Mills, Inc., 2110 West Hennepin Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota, has advised this office that he was stationed as a photographer for a balloon project recently and will confirm, under separate cover, 16 Jan or [REST OF LINE REDACTED] in company with Mr. [REDACTED] who will for the project made observations relative to a balloon which had previously been released.

2. While making their observations in Artesia, New Mexico, these and other sites also observed a round object sometimes motionless in the sky in the vicinity of the site of the conventional balloon. The atmosphere was clear, without clouds or haze.

3. The balloon which they were observing at the time had obtained a measured height of 126,000 feet at which altitude it should have been 110 knot in diameter and was drifting in an easterly direction at from 4 to 6 miles per hour. The balloon was about 1-2 miles appeared to be about 1-3rd in diameter, and the unknown object seemed to be about 2 or 3-4th in diameter. It was also observed to drift slowly.

4. [PARTIALLY ILLEGIBLE - APPEARS TO DISCUSS BALLOON ALTITUDE]

5. A short time later additional observations were made from the Mitchel Aircraft about three or four miles west of Artesia, about 110 yards above ground level. The site or four civilians also observed the [REDACTED] near the airport in an area, there or four miles from Artesia. The balloon was being tracked and the balloon which was above and slightly north of the airport. When sighted two objects as an estimate, were relatively stationary.

addition to the balloon, that they traveled through space very fast and appeared to follow a direct course, but as objects were not a reflection on a cloud for action as they appeared twice the size of the balloon which was not more than one mile; thousand feet altitude at the time. Started that the objects were a gray in color and did not match the bright sunlight.

3. On 21 March 1952, [redacted] and Supply to have was interviewed. He stated his attention was first drawn to the objects because of their position, to the balloon. The objects were distinct, not a reflection on a cloud for action as he was able to light his field glasses and see (9) objects in addition to the balloon, that one object was more centrally than the others, although he could not so blur by the distance this impression. that the objects were larger than the balloon which was about one thousand feet. These objects were dull gray in color with a rose tinge as a base, that they appeared to have a convex surface, being well lower than most. After two or three minutes, he was looking with field glasses, and seeing objects only at a distance apart and then appeared to rise an height 15 degrees both and leaving a terrific mass of condensation one or more of 5 to 6 ft. He could not state positively whether to do this or not. All three of the above persons stated that they believe the objects were intelligently controlled, partly because of the rapid distance relationships they maintained while accelerating and decelerating. They attached they believe an article in a local newspaper concerning the objects, but advised that [redacted] is presently a Floyd at Dallas, Texas.

4. On 21 March 1952, a search was conducted of the files at the local library. Located one newspaper article concerning the sighting of the above mentioned objects. All of the above persons are pilots and are reputable business men in the community. They appear to be of sound mind, good physical condition and are hesitant in calling their sighting a hoax.

part it was over Artesia, New Mexico. The two objects appeared to be
about 15 miles away. The two objects appeared to be round silver,
dull white in color and about 20 times the size of the 15 ft. balloon
visible in the vicinity. The objects were flying in a tight formation,
