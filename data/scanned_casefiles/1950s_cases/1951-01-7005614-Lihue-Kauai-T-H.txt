KAUAI FOLKS INSIST THEY SEE
FLYING SAUCERS

Special Star-Bulletin Correspondence
Lihue, Kauai, Jan. 24 - People are still seeing flying saucers on Kauai. It's one thing when a group of migratory workers report seeing them, but it's another when Kauai's county officials themselves see the things. Thursday afternoon from the window of the chairman's office, officials spotted a silvery disc at 6:30 p.m. on a clearday.

SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT
29 Jan. 1951
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aircraft
County Chairman and Supervisor H. K. Rice of Kauai, T.H. reported to the officer in charge of his local police office, that he and several others who were among those who saw the flying discs.
OBSERVERS AGREE:
They claim that visibility was excellent and that the silvery object appeared again to the plus of the sky. 
As the object hovered in the sky, Mr. Rice looked into his car and noted that the time as 1450 hours. The object then began to move rapidly and was soon lost to a cloud formation.
The observers agreed that the disc was controlled, but there seemed to be no indication of how it was powered.
This is the third report of flying discs over Kauai. Concern seems to be easing the Garden Island.
ACTION TAKEN: Office of the Intelligence Officer, Pacific Division, Military Air Transport Service, Hickam AF Base, APO 953, advised on 29 January 1951.
DISTRIBUTION: In addition to addresses, copies of this report are furnished: Chief, Intelligence Division, MATS, Andrews AF Base, Washington 25, D.C.; Intelligence Officer, PACD MATS, Hickam AF Base, APO 953.
