FLYING SAUCERS

Special Star-Bulletin Correspondence
Lihue, Kauai, Jan. 24 -- People are still seeing flying saucers on Kauai. It's one thing when a group of merry makers report seeing lights flying around in the sky early of a party morning, no matter how responsible the onlookers be.

It is another matter when Kauai's county officials spot a silvery disc at 6:30 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon from the window of the chairman's office.
