SUMMARY: An unidentified object was reported observed over the city of MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA for a period of about twenty-five (25) to thirty-five (25) minutes beginning about 0430Z, 1 December 1953 [ 2320 CST, 30 November 1953 ]. The object was observed by 3 SOURCES: (1) Civilian and (2) Air Force officers.

Object was reported to be stationary in the sky at an approximate altitude of 3000 to 4000 feet. The object appeared in the form of a bright light, flashing like a diamond form with a blue, yellow and green color. The object appeared to the observers to be about the size of a pea held out at arm's length. See inclosures A1, A2, A3, FORM A, Statement of Observer.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: The reliability of the SOURCES can be considered as GOOD. Two of the SOURCES are pilots with over 500 hours flying time. This was the first time SOURCES have even seen or reported any flying object. All SOURCES reported the object to be stationary or drifting slowly in the sky. The object appeared to be drifting very slowly in a south to north direction. All SOURCES reported the object to be brightly lit and changing in color from white then red, blue, yellow and green. After approximately thirty (30) minutes, the object disappeared. SOURCES could not hear any unusual sounds. All answered in the negative. SOURCES could not give an exact picture of the object. All thought the object was round with a blurred out line. All SOURCES stated that the object was approximately two (2) to three (3) miles from their respective positions and that the object was viewed at approximately eighteen (18) to twenty-five (25) degrees of elevation.

Sighting was clear. See enclosure #3, weather over MINNEAPOLIS,
MINNESOTA and LEEDS ALCFT.

ADDITIONAL ACTION: The preparing officer investigated other sources
in order to ascertain what, if any, additional information could have
been contacted. Contact was made with BASE OPERATIONS, 514th AIR DEFENSE GROUP,
10th FIGHTER INTERCEPT SQ-SABRE, and NAVAL AIR OPERATIONS.
All stationed at MINNEAPOLIS ST. PAUL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. Checked
all units contacted reported in the negative as to whether any
of their aircraft were in the air at the time of the sighting.

Contact was made thru P/I, 31st AIR DIVISION to request
AO and W site. Radar report received was in the negative.

The MINNEAPOLIS CENTRAL POWER AND INTELLIGENCER AIRCRAFT was contacted. Tower
reported that they were a part of a search of the object, results of scanning, negative. Tower
also reported that an airborne T-6 type aircraft, belonging
to the 515th AIR DIVISION, CHGPU, MINN, was in the area and was vectored into the area of the reported sighting.
T-6 report was negative.

Contact was made with the following civilian agencies in
order to determine whether these agencies had launched balloons
in the area on the date of the sighting:

CORNELL MILLS, person contacted, Mr. [redacted] report NEGATIVE

PHYSICS DEPT., UNIVERSITY of MINNESOTA, person contacted, Dr. [redacted]
reported that a balloon had been launched on 30 November
1953 but that a balloon was before 1900 hours of the same
day.

INTEL LABORATORIES, person contacted, Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted]
reported that a balloon had been launched at
1500 HOURS, 30 November 1953. No record of flight because
radio person on WLOL(?) could not give exact time of flight. Flight was number 216 and was due to fly all night. Balloon
was launched for purpose of research on a highly classified
project. Mr. [redacted] could not state whether the balloon
was launched because the object stayed in sight as long as reported.
At [redacted] location, no conclusions were drawn. Mr. [redacted]
Mr. [redacted] claims that balloon launched was the same
flight higher than the reported altitude of the unidentified
object.

All civilian agencies reported that all night research
balloons usually carry (1) red, (2) blue, red or white, and most
balloons can be tracked by radar.
