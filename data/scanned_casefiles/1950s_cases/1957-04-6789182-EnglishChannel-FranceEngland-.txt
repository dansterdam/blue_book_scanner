British Jets
Give Chase
To Object

LONDON, April 30 - Royal Air Force jet fighters last night chased a mystery object reported on a south easterly course over the English Channel.

The Javelin fighters from Odiham Base near Salisbury were alerted to the object, reported traveling at 700 miles an hour, over the Channel.

An Air Ministry spokesman in London, questioned later, said that the jets had chased the object for a time but had lost contact with it. He added that there was no explanation as to what the object was.

The Air Ministry said earlier that the chase occurred just before 9 o'clock last night.

The Air Ministry confirmed and repeated the facts of the chase and said that the object could have been a manufactured one or a natural phenomenon. He emphasized that no flying saucer had been detected by Royal Air Force fighters.

Air Ministry officials will give no further details "for national security reasons" but Air Minister George Ward tells a London evening newspaper tonight that the object was apparently capable of flying at 1,100 miles an hour. He said that the RAF was not convinced that this was the real answer.

"Saucer' Is Mirage - In Name Only

By the Associated Press

LONDON, May 9 - A mysterious object, easily identified British planes that united up to 15 miles over the Channel last week was identified today as a mirage from France, a spokesman for the London Evening News said.

The London Evening News said it came one of the morning's papers to receive reports of the "flying saucer" seen over the Channel. The News said it contacted the nearest air stations and civil aviation authorities and was told the object was "impossible to catch."

The spokesman said the apparent sighting of the object was due to optical illusion and atmospheric conditions.
