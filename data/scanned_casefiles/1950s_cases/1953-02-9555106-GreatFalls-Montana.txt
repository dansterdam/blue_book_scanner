1. On the night of 25 February 1953 Lieutenant Peter Marquez, S/Sgt Honey W. Mayer and A/1C Ramsey from the 170lst Air Transport Wing, Great Falls Air Force Base, Montana, were returning to the base in a car along Highway 87 from Dodson, Montana, where they had made an investigation of a reported sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object near Dodson on the night of 22 February 1953.

2. When they reached a point on the highway about 25 miles northeast of Great Falls Air Force Base at 2020 hours MST, they noticed a very bright, flickering, white light in the sky about a distance of 10 miles. The southwest, and which appeared to be at an altitude of some 4000 to 4500 feet above the terrain. This light appeared similar to burning magnesium. Abruptly the light began descending toward the earth with a very great speed. Then it reached a point about one-third of the distance from the original height to the ground, it burst into a flash that increased in intensity and magnitude about 10 times its original size, then the light decelerated in speed but continued to drop, resembling a parachute plane. At a point about half way to the ground from its original position the light disappeared completely.

I. Description of Incident:
A civilian man from this location sighted an unidentified aerial object on three separate occasions - 25 Feb 53 at 0025z, 5 Mar 53 at 2115z, and 6 Mar 53 at 1952z.

II. Discussion of Incident
Very little information has been gathered on this sighting, even a basic description of the object's appearance has not been submitted to Project Blue Book. Furthermore, noting is known of the observer's operational levels, corroborative witnesses, etc. In the light of the scant information received, the report has to be carried as insufficient data for evaluation until an AF Form 112 arrives.

III. Conclusion
Insufficient data.

FROM: [Space above for Communications Center only]

INFO:

especially if it develops that the unknown object appeared in the same relative position each time. Also, advise informal check into Mr. Lee's character, local reputation, etc., to be sure that the sightings are not the result of a "crackpot". Advise Mr. Lee that Air Force is taking an interest in his sightings. Four USAF Technical Information Sheets are being forwarded your organization, one of which should be filled out by Mr. [illegible]. This and also an AF Form 112 consolidating a report of the 3 incidents should be sent to ATIC per AFL 200-5 at the earliest possible date.

In reply cite Project Blue Book.

ATIC has been advised by M/Hq USAF that your organization has received 3 separate reports on 25 Feb 53 and 5 and 6 Mar 53 of an unidentified serial object sighted at Great Falls by one [redacted]. ATIC advises the following in handling the incident: 1) Ask Mr. Lee to determine the approximate azimuth and elevation readings in each case, or at least its general position in the sky. Was the object in the same position and of the same description in each instance? 2) Were there other observers or witnesses? 3) Check local radar facilities to determine if they recorded anything unusual at the dates and times of sightings. 4) Check local weather balloon launches as a possible cause for one or more of the sightings. Although 2 out of the 3 sightings are in the daytime, bright stars such as Venus are sometimes visible during the day. Venus has caused many incidents in the last month and ATIC advises that a local astronomer be contacted on this possibility.

TWX from CO 1701st AT WG, Great Falls, Montana (No. and Date Time Group Unknown)

Submitted in accordance with AF LTR. No. 200-5, dated 20 April 1952, Subj: Unidentified Flying Object Reporting.

At approximately 2020 hours MST on the night of 25 February 1953, an Unidentified Flying Object was observed visually from the ground by an Air Force Lieutenant and two airmen at a point approximately 15 miles northeast of Great Falls, Montana, at an altitude of 1400 feet above the terrain (approximate coordinates 111° 15' N - 47° 29' E).

The object when first observed appeared as an extremely bright, flickering, whitish light as one caused by burning magnesium, and tinges of deep red were discernible. The light area roughly began an arrowhead shape, then it marched a point about one-third of the way from its original height to the ground, the light burst into a flash and its intensity and magnitude increased about ten times, resembling a parachute flares. At a peak, about one half way to the ground, the light disappeared abruptly. No sound was heard.

Weather conditions at the time of the sighting were not given nor was any information furnished as to the presence or absence of known air-borne aircraft in the vicinity.
