One round clear silver object, size of dime at arm's length. Obj initially sighted air-visually at approx 20,000 ft altitude at 30, 10N 123W. Obj was near contrail of a B-47. Obj's flight path was straight & climbing. Observers attempted intercept action & obj appeared to be between interceptor & contrail & under contrail. This led pilot to believe obj was close & he initiated maximum performance of a/c. A/C was climbing at 250kts but obj appeared to pull away & up. Obj viewed a/v for approx 10 min. still visible.
