(APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948)

UNCLASSIFIED

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: United States
LOCATION: Raimer, Alabama

DATE OF REPORT: 17 February 1953
FROM: 2800th AU Wing Intell Section
Maxwell AFB, Montgomery, Alabama

PREPARED BY: Edward R. Swartz, 1/Lt, USAF, Mg Intell Off. Mr

SUMMARY:
At 1650 hours (local time), 16 March 1953, Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] were watching an AF B-47 when their attention was drawn to a noiseless, metallic object executing maneuvers at an altitude about two-thirds the altitude of the B-47.

These maneuvers were being performed in and around a few scattered clouds. The speed of the object was estimated as about 3 times that of the B-47. (Check with the Maxwell Station revealed that the B-47 was at 20,000 feet.)

A further check with the Maxwell Radio Range revealed that an AF B-47 #8355 from McDill AFB, Florida was in the area at 35,000 feet with a speed of 425 knots. In trace course that could not give an accurate description of the object, but it appeared to be about the size of an F-80. Both observers state that at times the object appeared to be round, then again, when viewed from another angle, it looked flat. It had no vapor trails, but the object observed left no vapor trails and showed no signs of propulsion.

This object performed maneuvers that are impossible for known conventional aircraft to perform. Both observers agreed the object seemed to maintain a constant speed through such maneuvers. They described the object as climbing, diving, executing right and left angle turns and reversing its course without turning at an angle or in a circle.

Subject sightings were made by the naked eye. The observers were located on the ground at Raimer, Alabama (34°09'30"N, 86°13'30"W). Observers state that they were about 11 miles south of the object and viewed the object from a 45° angle. This observation was carried on a 300° course at approximately 1650 hours. The total time was approximately 20 minutes.

The weather report aloft for this area at the time of the above-mentioned sighting was as follows: broken ceiling, scattered clouds at 20,000 feet, winds 270° at least 80 knots, temp 15.5 centigrade, visibility unlimited.

This office has no further confirmation of subject sighting. A check with McDill AFB revealed no reports by pilots on subject sighting. Both observers are untrained or spotter or pilots and have never witnessed such sighting before.

UNCLASSIFIED

Raimer, Alabama                                                16 February 1953

I.   Description of Incident

Two civilian men at this location sighted an unidentified object as 1620 EST with watching the flight of a B-47 aircraft cross their field of vision. A metallic looking object appearing round at one instant and flat the next was seen at an altitude of about two-thirds that of the B-47 which ATIC learned was at 35,000 ft. Its maneuvers consisted of climbing, diving, and sharp angle turns to the left and right in and around a few scattered clouds and it appeared to be faster than the B-47. Total time of sighting was for 20 minutes.

II.  Discussion of Incident

Although the Maxwell Radio Range Station reported no known aircraft other than the B-47 in the area ATIC feels that, on the basis of the description submitted by the two relatively inexperienced observers, they probably sighted a fighter type aircraft, possibly an F-86, maneuvering in the air space below the B-47. To support this conclusion is the fact that the clouds mentioned in the original report around which the object was sighted, were determined to be at 20,000 ft. At this altitude a fighter aircraft would be hard to distinguish. The observers did state, however, that the object appeared to have swept-back wings.

III. Conclusion

Possibly aircraft.
