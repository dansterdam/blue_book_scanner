AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

A civilian observer at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, reports sighting a round, disc-like object, approximately twenty (20) feet in diameter.

The object was first observed at 3:30 p.m. on November 28, 1951, when it was noticed coming from the northeast. It appeared to be traveling at a speed estimated at between 400-500 m.p.h. and made no sound. The object was in sight for approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds before disappearing in the northwest.

The observer states the object was an extremely bright, metallic-appearing, disc-like craft. He noted no protrusions or appendages, and the object appeared to be rotating slowly as it traveled. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of about 3,000 feet and was observed by the witness and a co-worker. 

No radar tracking or other official confirmation of this sighting is available. The report indicates the sighting was made by a responsible, reliable observer, but there was no physical evidence or corroborating witnesses other than the co-worker.

APPROVED:
THOMAS E. BAKER, Colonel, USAF
Director of Intelligence

It then pulled up to a horizontal position and started traveling straight down to approximately 300 feet of the ridge again. It then started moving up to a higher altitude at an angle of about 45 degrees and disappeared into the clouds. No further sighting of the object was made.
