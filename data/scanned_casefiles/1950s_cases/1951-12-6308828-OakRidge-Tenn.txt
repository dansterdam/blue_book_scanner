SUMMARY. (Give coding summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List locations in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part II)

Civilian observer at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, reports sighting a smooth, grey-white object, approximately 20 feet square, resembling a piece of canvas.

The report states the object 2039 and descended between a point approximately 300 feet above a ridge (altitude not given) and the cloud level (6000 feet). During four observation periods of 30 to 10 seconds each, an observer at Oak Ridge tracked and descended twice. If true, this would necessitate the object's traveling (at 5760 feet per minute or constant) a total of 5760 feet in 10 minutes, or approximately 34,600 feet per minute. At the highest, the ridge would be approximately 3000 feet, necessitating the object traveling 20,000 feet in two minutes per minute, which is still extremely rapid.

Sug set the observer saw something as stated in the report, but was in error as to the amount and speed of travel.

SW, 16 mph. Altimeter; 013.

0928 EST - Clouds; Estimated 6,500 broken. Visibility; 30 miles.

1004 EST - Clouds; 6,000 scattered. Visibility; 30 miles. Winds; 
SW 20 mph. Altimeter; 013.

g. Activity or Conditions:
Guard reported that object was first observed 300 feet from 
the top of a ridge of small hills running East and West and that 
the estimated North of Plank K-25. Object was rising straight up into 
the air and went to the base of the cloud layer. It then started back 
down (straight) until it was approximately 300 feet from the ridge 
again. The object then started back up at about a 45 degree angle to 
the left and went into the clouds. Object came out of the clouds and 
straight down to approximately 300 feet of the ridge again. It then 
started to make a circle rising slowly during this maneuver and then 
went up into the clouds at about a 20 degree angle disappearing con-
pletely into the clouds. No further sighting of the object was made.
Total time of observations was two minutes.

h. Physical Evidence:
None

i. Interception or Identification:
Object was first sighted at 0815 EST by [redacted] and no mention 
was made that object was airborne when reported. Therefore GCI was 
not notified by the Security Section. The Security Section thinking 
the object was ground forces, sent patrol to investigate. After 
requesting anything, the Security Section called Guard at 1000 EST 
1000 EST and then it was found that the object was airborne at all 
times. At 1002 EST, GCI was notified and two F-47s were sent over to 
the area. However, the object had disappeared and no interception 
was made.

j. Airborne Aircraft:
Two F-47s that were in the air as Combat Air Patrol were used to at-
tempt an interception.
