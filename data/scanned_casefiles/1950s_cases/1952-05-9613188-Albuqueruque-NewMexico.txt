In accordance with ADC Letter 200-1, dated 11 April 1951. Subject as above, the following report of unconventional Aircraft is submitted.

On the 10th of May 1952, at approximately 2100 MST, two unconventional airborne objects were observed by Colonel and Mrs. [redacted] from their residence at 3527 Eastern Avenue, Albuquerque, New Mexico. The first object was not as high as the second; however, both were similar in that objects were silver, disc shaped and made no sound. Both objects were first sighted in the northwest and disappeared in the northeast. There was no visible means of propulsion. Due to altitude speed could not be estimated.

The objects were observed from five (5) to ten (10) minutes. No photographs were taken.

The informants are completely reliable and Colonel Bechtel is a member of the 34th Air Division (Defense), Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.

SHORT STATEMENT                                                  13 May 1952

34th Air Division (DCS), Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, do hereby wish to make the following statement:

At approximately 1500 MST, 10 May 1952, I sighted an unidentified airborne object from my home at 3527 Eastern Avenue, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

My wife and I were in the front yard watching airplanes land at Kirtland Air Force Base and identifying the various types of planes. I went in the house, and Mrs. Bechtel called me to come out again and identify an object that she had sighted in the sky. When I went outside, the object was southwest of Kirtland Air Force Base, at an altitude above 20,000 feet. It seemed to be silvery disc shaped and was following a northeast course at a constant speed and appeared to waver on its axis. I watched this object for about five (5) minutes; however, I cannot estimate the speed or the real height.

In approximately ten (10) minutes another object appeared in the southwest section. When I saw this, I ran across the street and telephoned the Controller of the 34th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. Lieutenant Wagner was the officer on duty at that time. I asked him if he had it on the scope, but he said that he wasn't able to pick it up. By the time we finished our conversation the object was in the northeast, and it was much higher than the first one that I had sighted. Two F-86's were flying at about 35,000 feet, but this object was much higher and pursuing a constant course. I watched this object for about five (5) or ten (10) minutes until it disappeared from sight.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 13th day of May 1952.

I, Mrs. [redacted] woman, Albuquerque, New Mexico, do hereby wish to make the following statement:

On the 10th of May, 1952, at about 1500 MST, I was in my front yard watching two jet type airplanes flying over Kirtland Air Force Base. Suddenly, I noticed an object in the sky above Kirtland Air Force Base. I called my husband, who was in the house at that time, to come out, as I saw something that did not look like any airplane that I had ever seen.

The object was northwest of Kirtland Air Force Base, at an altitude above 20,000 feet. It had no tail and seemed to be circular shaped. It was silver in color and the size was about the same as a B-36 at 25,000 feet. The object appeared at times to float over and over. My husband and I watched this object for five (5) or ten (10) minutes.

About ten (10) or fifteen (15) minutes later, another object appeared in the southwest. This object looked similar to the first except it was much higher than the first. As soon as my husband saw this second object, he called the Controller of the 125th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico; however, the officer on duty reported that the object did not appear on the scope. This second object disappeared in about ten (10) minutes in the northeasterly direction.
