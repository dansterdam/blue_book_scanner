The text on the page is partially legible. Here's what I can make out:

1st line: "the hole gives"
2nd line: Partially illegible, appears to have numbers
3rd line: "...appears to have"
4th line: "come from S W."
5th line: Partially illegible
Last line: "...ago"

Some words and parts of the text are not clearly readable due to the poor quality of the scanned document.

On the morning of 29 July, 1959,
the ATIC received a call from a man
southwest of Dayton. Who stated that
the neighborhood children was picking up
some strange looking rocks and she was
afraid they may be radioactive. In the
afternoon of 29 July, Major's friend and
Capt. Sadler departed W-P AFB to investigate
the report. Upon the arrival of the two
AF men, who stated that the night before she had started out in her
car and as she was driving along big
ball of fire seemed to fall toward her car.
She said that it appeared to explode to
above and in front of her. She said she just
drove through the falling pieces. A neighbor
said they heard a loud noise at this time
which sounded like a sonic-boom.

Some of the pieces were submitted to the
Smithsonian Institution for analysis. A few pieces
were found to the same cult used for capturing
some secondary work.
