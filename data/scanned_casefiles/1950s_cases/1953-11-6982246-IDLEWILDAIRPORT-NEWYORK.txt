UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
OVER IDLEWILD AIRPORT
ON 2 NOVEMBER 1953

File: 24-366

The size of each object is compared to that of a fifty cent piece (50¢) 
held at arm length, and were bathtub gray in color. At no time 
was there any sign of tail trail or exhaust, nor was any sound heard, 
as informant was in a closed and moving vehicle.

When first observed, [redacted] advised that t.e objects appeared to 
be hovering but that the lower group was moving in an easterly direction 
with the upper group in a westerly direction. These objects were at a 
150 azimuth and changed to approximately 400 azimuth and were at the 
general height of eight thousand (8,000) feet. These observations lasted 
for approximately fifteen (15) minutes and terminated upon buildings ob-
structing the view. [redacted] further advised that he had obtained these 
objects without the assistance of binoculars or telescope and cant not 
pictures were taken as he had no camera in his immediate possession.

[redacted] stated that the weather had been fair, that the sun was 
setting, and that the sky had scattered cirrus clouds to the south-west, 
and that at one time the type cloud had obscured the lower group of 
objects.

[redacted] stated that a helicopter of the windmill type and a DC-3 
commercial aircraft were in the air at the time. At arms length, 
[redacted] compared the helicopter to a five cent piece (5¢), and the DC-3 
to a twenty-five cent piece (25¢), and that they were at 20 and 35 
degrees azimuth respectively.
