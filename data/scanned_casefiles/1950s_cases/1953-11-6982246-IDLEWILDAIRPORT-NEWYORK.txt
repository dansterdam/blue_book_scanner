OVER IDLEWILD AIRPORT
ON 2 NOVEMBER 1953

DETAILS:

1. This investigation was requested by the District Commander, 2D MI District (GS) USAF, 72 Broad Street, New York, New York, and predicated upon the report of six (6) unidentified flying objects over Idlewild Airport, New York on 2 November 1953.

AT NEW YORK, NEW YORK

On 25 December 1953, the witness, an enlisted man with the United States Navy as an enlisted man with principal duties of watch-duty and lookout, and has been employed by the Pan American Airways as a Patrolman in the New York City Police Department, with station at the 106th Precinct, 2120, Rockaway Beach, New York. He advised that at 2210 hours Zulu time (2110 Eastern Standard time), 2 November 1953, while riding in a bus from Idlewild Airport to Jamaica, New York, in a northerly direction, he observed six (6) flying objects in a flighty (sic) direction. He stated that one (1) flight appeared to the east at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 7,000 feet, and that they gave the appearance of a formation resembling (5,000) feet and that they gave the appearance of a formation resembling (see illustration no. 1 below). On the second formation, he stated that in view of the bus being in motion and making turns, were lost from view by buildings. During the course of the observation, there were three (3) formations observed. On the second formation, the objects appeared again in a rear window of the bus, flying with a solid non-lighted area in the center, and that the top portion of each object appeared to be that of an inverted bowl or of the upper portion of a blimp's rudder (see illustration no. 2 below). For that one of the objects, the illustration is more centrally located (see illustration no. 3 below for one of the objects).

The image contains a diagram and text related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) observed near Idlewild Airport in New York on November 2, 1953. The diagram shows the estimated positions and bearings of the UFOs relative to the observer. The text describes the observations, including that the UFOs appeared to be flying objects, that there was no sound or trail associated with them, and that a helicopter was also observed in the area at the time. The text also mentions that the weather was fair and that the sun was setting when the UFOs were observed.

OVER IDLEWILD AIRPORT
NOVEMBER 2, 1953

The size of each object is compared to that of a fifty cent piece (50¢) held at arm's length, and were basically green in color. At no time was there any sign of tail trail or exhaust, nor was any sound heard, as it flashed by in a direct and moving direction.

When first observed, the observer advised that the objects appeared to be hovering but that the lower group was moving in an easterly direction with the upper group in a westerly direction. These objects were at an estimated 1500 altimeter and of considerable magnitude as previously described. At no times were they in horizontal alignment but were in columnar and vertical formation approxima tely fourteen (14) minutes and terminated upon buildings obscuring further observation. These objects afforded the attention of numerous other witnesses as to their presence, for telescopes and can be no satisfactory explanation of the actual contents, other than of unidentified origin.

It was advised that the weather had been fair, that the sun was setting, and that the sky had scattered clouds to the southwesterly and that at one time the type cloud had obscured the lower group of objects.

It was stated that a helicopter of the windmill type and a TU-3 compass compass were in the air at the time. At some length, compared the helicopter to a five cent piece (5¢) and the TU-3 to a twenty-five cent piece (25¢) and that they were at 10 and 35 degree azimuth respectively.

SIMILAR and UNUSUAL HELICOPTER FLIGHTS: they believe this helicopter flights they received very little information, but they know that the craft were to follow the Van Houtain route, petering into Idlewild, the helicopters would never exceed an attitude of 1200 feet. ALL THIS revealed that it is believed that a helicopter with a maximum gear configuration, would be capable of being in all flight one aircraft, due to the reflection of its lights against the motor blades.
