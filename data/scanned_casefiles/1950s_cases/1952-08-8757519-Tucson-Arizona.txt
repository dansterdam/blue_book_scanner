SECTION D

22. In the following sketch, imagine your eye at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved lines to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. Place a "B" to show where it was when when you last saw it.

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

The page contains three diagrams illustrating the movement of an object relative to the horizon and the observer's eye, with instructions for marking the object's initial and final positions.

29. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?
(Circle One): Yes or No

29.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too?
(Circle One): Yes or No

Same address.

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper if necessary.

I HAVE BEEN A PILOT SINCE 1939 AND SERVED ALMOST 4 YEARS IN WORLD WAR II AS A PILOT.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SIMILAR TO THIS BEFORE, BUT I WOULD SAY IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A REFLECTION OF ANY KIND. IT SEEMED MUCH TOO REAL AND TO HAVE SUBSTANCE. IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A WEATHER BALLOON. THE CHANGING OF DIRECTION AND SPEED WOULD INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT WAS UNDER SOME KIND OF CONTROL.

I HAD ONLY ONE INDICATION OF ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT SINCE I DID NOT HAVE ANY WAY OF ESTIMATING ALTITUDE, THOUGH THE SKY WAS CLEAR IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. THERE WERE CLOUDS IN THE WEST INTO WHICH THE OBJECT SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR WHEN IT PASSED FROM SIGHT. I WOULD ESTIMATE THE ALTITUDE AT APPROXIMATELY 20,000 FT.

AFOIN C/CC - 2

1.  At 17:40, MST, 24 August 1952, Mr. [redacted] of Tucson, Arizona, and his wife, observed a large, round, unidentified, brilliant, white light traveling from due north of their position towards the west. White status that the object is first appeared stationary but soon started to move in a wavering, dancing motion towards the west. The lower one-third of the object appeared to be surrounded by a misty, white substance less brilliant than the object itself and the lower extremity of the spheres protruded below this "halo". (See diagram).  The object appeared to be of a metallic substance.

2.  Significance — Unknown

A3rd Bomb ing. Intelligence Div.                                                  2

1. The subject seen by Mr. [redacted] was a white, steady, bright light. It
appeared to be about the size of a B-29 or B-50 when viewed at 20,000 feet
altitude. It appeared to be of a smaller size than that traveling at a rate
of speed slower than that of a B-29 or B-50. There was no evidence of a propulsion
system in that there was no exhaust or jet trail. The lower wing/tail of the
object was surrounded by a misty substance of less brilliance than the object
itself. The lower wing/tail of the object was brighter metallic than the object
itself. The substance did not appear to be exhaust or being metallic. The object
moved in a wavering, undulating, rocking motion, then came toward the east,
then sat. It was a light dimmed out and disappeared for no apparent reason at
approximately 11:12 MST.

2. Time sighted — 217.50 MST, 21 August 1952.

3. Manner of Observation — Visual only. Six power field glasses were used.

4. Location of Observer — 32° 22' 55"N 110° 55' 50"W
The altitude of the object could not be estimated because of single point observation.
The object was first observed due north of the observer. The object was in level
traverse from west to east. The object was first observed at a point where the
object could not be judged but the observer did state that the object traveled at
a relatively lower rate of speed than a B-29 he had compared earlier. The
sighting occurred.

5. Information on Observer: Mr. [redacted] was born in Federal employ
since 1930. He worked 3 years in the United States Army Air Force and is
presently employed as the Chief Electrician for AIO at Lowry-Montana Air Force
Base. His reliability is considered by him as competent. He is 37 years
able to observe the object for about one minute through 6 power field glasses.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Information on Unidentified Flying Object

Location: Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.

Date of Report: 12 August 1952     Date of Observation: 6 August 1952

Prepared by: Capt B H Pestalozzi

Source: S/Sgt

ATIN - C/CO - 2

1. Approximately 2002 MST, 6 August 1952, S/Sgt ... of the radar control tower operations at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson Arizona, sighted a round, brilliant object appearing three (3) miles southeast of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base on an altitude of about five thousand (5000) feet. The object was round in shape and intensity of a landing light glowed with a yellowish-white light and seemed to be climbing at an unestimable rate of speed. The light traveled in a general northwest heading during approximately ten minutes until directly over the Air Base at fifteen thousand (15000) to twenty thousand (20000) feet of altitude. At that position the object became stationary, hovering for about ten ... The light then seemed to move about slowly in an irregular pattern ... with's light intermittently. It then moved off on a general northwest heading picking up speed as it disappeared at 2030 MST.

2. No significance attached to sighting.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Heading details partially obscured]

1. At approximately 2002 MST, 6 August 1952, S/Sgt [redacted] operators at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona, sighted a round, brilliant object appearing three (3) miles southeast of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base at an altitude of about five thousand (5000) feet. The object was first seen in a generally northwesterly direction and was a well-defined white light and seemed to be climbing at an unestimable rate of speed. The light traveled in a general northwest seating ninth its ascent until directly over the Air Base at fifteen thousand (15000) feet. At twenty thousand (20000) feet of altitude, at that position the object became stationary, hovering for about ten minutes. The light then seemed to move about slightly in an irregular pattern.

During this light investigation to CMAS control tower operators for confirmation of the sighting, the Tucson Municipal Airport tower operators stated they thought they sighted the object but couldn't confirm it.

S/Sgt [redacted] then sent out a blanket call over Bravo channel to any aircraft in the vicinity for confirmation of the sighting. A C-47, AC-293, even [redacted] Air Force Base, flying at 15,000 feet over Phoenix, Arizona maneuvered [redacted] will and already confirmed the sighting. He described it as an intensely brilliant white light, about the size of a G-47, at several thousand (7000) feet traveling towards Phoenix. As about 20 miles south of the pilot's aircraft around to pursue the object but he had lost sight of it. The pilot again contacted DAPS Control tower at 2045 stating that he was in the 3rd block Arizona area and had again sighted a bright white light at 17000 feet in the Chandler Arizona area traveling towards Tucson. He stated the object made the trip from Chandler to Tucson, a distance of 17 miles, in 5 to 7 seconds.

During his transmissions to CMAS Control tower the pilot of C-47, AC-293, stated that the object he saw was not an airplane, was spherical in shape, had no projection and moved in an unusual trail, confirming the impressions of the Davis-Monthan Control tower operators.

2. Sighting occurred at 2002 MST, 6 August 1952, lasted 28 minutes.

3. The DMAS Control tower operators used 7x50 power government issue field glasses during their observation.
