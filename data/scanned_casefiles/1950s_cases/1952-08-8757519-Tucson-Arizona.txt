30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
I have been a pilot since 1949 and served almost 4 years in World War II as a pilot. I have seen many things similar to this object. It is a perfectly real and not fanciful. It was only one indication of altitude of the object since I did not have any other measuring devices. However, the sky was clear in all directions and the object appeared to be closer than the stars. It seemed much too large and too close to have been a star. It could possibly have been a weather balloon, but it seemed much too large and bright as we observed it. The duration and speed of observation would not fit the characteristics of a weather balloon.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

Approximately 2002 MPH, the speed being approximately 19.2 miles per minute, at an altitude between 20,000 and 10,000 feet. This craft was estimated to be round or saucer-shaped, the diameter being estimated at about 30 feet. The craft was a very bright, silvery-white in color, and the brilliance and intensity of a landing light.

The craft traveled in a general northeast to southwest direction, traveling along at a constant speed until just before it disappeared. The light had appeared to have stopped for a moment, then sped up rapidly as it disappeared.

The report states that "no projections and only a red light on the craft was observed, and no sound was heard, confirming the impressions of the observers that this was an unidentified object".

Sighting occurred at 2002 EST, 6 August 1952, lasted 15 minutes.

The USAF's control tower operators used 7550 power goggles (Government Issue field glasses) to track this craft.
