WEDDLE that he had observed an unusual phenomena and was writing a letter to Headquarters USAF explaining his observation. On 8 April 1957 Special Agent GLENN T. COX interviewed [redacted] at his office.

A cigar shaped core, approximately the size of a DC-6 at 1000 to 1500 feet, surrounded by an elliptical light with length 1 1/2 times and width radius 1/2 times as long as the cigar shaped core. The elliptical glow was bright golden in color; while the cigar shaped core was approximately five times brighter than the outer light and was a yellow flickering color. No object had no discernible details, no tail or exhaust stream, and issued no sound.

Mr. [redacted] advised that his attention was directed to this object by its brilliant glow.

the turning off of an electric light, in that there was an immediate blackout and no
gradual fading of this light. He estimated that he observed this object for approx-

This observation was made on the ground without the aid of any mechanical
equipment.

[Redacted] indicated that insofar as he knew he was the only one to observe
this incident and at the time of his observation he was standing in front of his home
which faces in a southerly direction.
