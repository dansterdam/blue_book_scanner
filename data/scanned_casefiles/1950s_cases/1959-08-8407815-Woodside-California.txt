Dear Major Tacker:

This letter is written in request of further information concerning an object described as a high-altitude wind measuring instrument in a United Press International (UPI) telephoto of September 16, 1959.

The caption to the UPI telephoto reads as follows:

"IDENTIFIED - An Air Force captain today said this mysterious object is no mystery - it's a high altitude wind measuring device. Capt. Dale Tromblay said at Pittsburgh Airport that the thing had been attached to a balloon and sent aloft to measure winds. The balloon collapsed and the instrument fell into a Pittsburgh park, causing much consternation."

On September 16, 1959 and again on September 30th we wrote to the PIO at Greater Pittsburgh Airport (title), Mk. no. etc.), the name of the manufacturer and some data as to the instrument's function and capabilities.

Since, according to the press release, the object had been positively identified and a photograph and description given to the public, we assumed that in seeking further details of the device the proper source to query would be the Air Force PIO at Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

We have today received a letter, dated October 7, 1959, from the 758th Troop Carrier Squadron, Medium (Reserve), USAF, Greater Pittsburgh Airport. This letter, under the subject heading of "Unidentified Flying Object", acknowledges our inquiries of September 16th and 30th and advises us that "all information concerning such objects will be disseminated through Major Tokar."

Until the message from the 758th we were not aware that the object was considered to be a UFO, otherwise we would have addressed our original inquiry directly to you.

If the object in question is not a UFO it is hoped that you will be kind enough to supply us with the information requested in paragraph 3(page-1).

If the object is a UFO, is it true that the Air Force now has tangible evidence?

Sincerely yours,
Secretary, NICAP

Inadvertently, our letter was addressed to the Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania instead of Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. For this reason it may not have reached you yet and as a precaution this letter is being sent in its stead.

We would appreciate it if you would give us the official designation of the instrument(title, Mark no., etc.) and if possible, the name of the manufacturer and some data as to the instrument's function and capabilities.

Thank you for whatever assistance you may be able to provide.

FRICK PARK AREA, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA
15 September 1959

On 15 September 1959 the Pittsburgh police investigated a reported explosion in the Frick Park area of the city. The explosion was reported to have occurred at 2:00 on 11 September 1959. During the investigation the police discovered an unidentified object in the area of the reported explosion. The object was cylindrical in shape, and the body was of polyethylene plastic, yellow in color. Three wires appearing like an antenna protruded from the top just below a red light. Attached to the side was a "U" bolt with two feet of 1/8" cable attached to it with 1/2" bolts. The weight of the object was twelve pounds. The object was burned around the edge of the base.

During inspection of the object attempts were made to open it without destroying it, but this proved impossible. Under the plastic coat, which averaged 1/2" in thickness, was a thin sheet of aluminum with the same general contours. Contained in the aluminum were the following items, all embedded in a glue-like substance which was used to fill the interior:

a. Hilco Huntlite lantern battery container with switch.
b. Steel pipe (threaded both ends) 2 1/2" long and 1 3/4" diameter.
c. Eight Ray-O-Vac flashlight batteries (four in the battery container).
d. Two mercury switches.
e. Tiny atom 1/2000 horsepower electric motor (Wilson's of Cleveland).
f. Transformer (Federal Telephone and Radio Corporation, Boonton, N. J.).

The batteries, mercury switches, electric motor, and light bulb were all wired; however, the electric motor was not connected mechanically to anything. The antenna and transformer were not a part of the circuit.

Wilson's of Cleveland, manufacturers of the tiny atom electric motor, when contacted concerning the motor indicated that their chief outlet were hobby shops.

In view of the relatively great weight, inaccessibility, overall lack of any productive function, and crudeness this object is ruled out as a device designed to collect atmospheric data.

All evidence indicates that this object was not airborne at any time. An object weighing twelve pounds would, upon falling to earth from any appreciable altitude, have left an impression in the ground which would have been noticed during investigation. Further indication that the object had not fallen was the fact that the light bulb and fragile plastic cover were found intact.

It is the Air Force conclusion that this object and the explosion were all part of a hoax. The red light, flashed by mercury switches, and the whirling of an little electric motor were designed to create further mystery for the finder. Since this incident happened at the beginning of the school term, this may be a baby a prank or college students.

Report of a strange object rising in the sky at 1:05 a.m. CDT, Sunday, September 13, 1959, in Door County, one and one-half miles southeast of Gills Rock, Wisconsin.

I, [redacted], Route 1, Green Bay, Wisconsin, while on my parent's farm, notice the following strange object rising in the sky, accompanied by repeated blasts of noise, similar to a jet plane. I had planned on going fishing in the morning, and at this early hour I was picking night-crawlers. Suddenly there was a loud noise that immediately made me think of a jet plane in flight quite low to the ground. One difference in the noise was that this noise was pulsating, and seemed like it was rather close/in the field. After 2 or 3 minutes, I noticed the strange object in the sky, rising at a terrific speed, straight up, rising higher and higher until it looked like a star. However, when I first noticed the object, the base seemed round with yellowish light, with eight blue lights on the outside, and five red lights located in the center. These red lights were about twice as big as the blue lights. No exhaust or jet stream could be seen. It took approximately ten minutes time for all this to happen. Mother and my wife both heard the noise while in the house. Mother looked out of the window to see what caused the noise. However, she was on the wrong side of the house and consequently could not see anything. The sky was clear.

When I came into the house, I immediately set down and made a colored sketch of the object, on regular-size white envelope.

I am rather reluctant to make this report. Yet I know that I saw and heard something strange that I wish someone would explain.

[Dated] September 13, 1959.

Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: Chief, USAF, Washington

FROM: MIC, WMCB, Green Bay, Wisconsin

DATE: 9-16-59

SUBJECT: Strange objects in the sky.

References: Attached report dated September 14, 1959, by Roland H. Daubner.

The report on sighting of strange object in the sky by Mr. [redacted] on Route #1, Green Bay, Wisconsin, is forwarded for your information.

When making his report, Mr. [redacted] seemed to be quite sincere, with better than average intelligence. His age would be guessed to be in the upper twenties. Some was spent in the army where he learned to recognize the sound of planes, and he now works in paper factory. His personal appearance was neat and clean.

Mr. [redacted] did not want his story publicized and claims he has not spoken on this object to anyone else, outside of his family. In discussing, the story with the local City Military, it was learned that this was the first he had heard of it, and up to this time the story has not been carried in the press.

DATE December 14, 1959

I was on my parents' farm, about one and one-half miles northwest of Stickle Park, evening. At about 1:00 o'clock central daylight saving time I went outside to pick some night crawlers for a fishing trip and glanced for the next day.

I was out there only about five minutes when all of a sudden some very such a loud noise out in the field it made my ears hurt. Some noise in the was probably, it seemed to stay right over in the field for a few seconds, and then it started to move up, at this point I looked up and I saw the object. It appeared like the bottom side of a craft going straight up. It was a bridge-like object, kind of ring of light. There was a very bright blue lights just inside the yellow with eight very bright blue lights where a ring of red lights much brighter than the blue lights.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

a. Hilco Nuntlite lantern battery container with switch.

b. Steel pipe (threaded both ends) 2 1/2 inches long, 1 3/4 inches diameter.

c. Light Ray--7ac flashlight batteries (four in the battery container). Batteries outside of the container were covered with electrical tape.

d. Two mercury switches.

e. Tiny atom, 1/50 horsepower electric motor (Wilson's of Cleveland).

f. Transformer (Federal Telephone and Radio Corporation, Boonton, N. J.)

g. Flashlight bulb and socket with red plastic cover.

h. Three antenna like extensions (approximately 5 1/2 inches long).

6. The batteries, mercury switches, electric motor, and bulb were all wired; however, the electric motor was not connected mechanically to anything. The unusual and transformer were not a part of circuits.

The only electric function of this item is the operation of the flashing red light, and running, the little electric motor.

7. Wilson's of Cleveland, manufacturers of the tiny atom electric motor, was contacted by telephone. Mr. Greenwald of that company informed Major Byrd that they do not have a contract to supply the U. S. Government with these motors. It was also pointed out by Mr. Greenwald that one of their chief outlets for these motors are hobby shops.

8. In view of the relatively great weight, absence of any transmitter or meteorological equipment, and the unusually and overall lack of an obvious productive function, this object is ruled out as a navigable device used by the government.

9. All evidence indicates that this object was not airborne or flying at any time. An object weighing twelve pounds would, upon falling to earth from any appreciable altitude, have left an impression that would have been worth special mention in the report of Major Hasten and Captain Trombley. Further indication that the object had not fallen was the fact that the light bulb and its red plastic cover were found intact.

10. It is ATIC's opinion that this object and the explosion were all part of a hoax. The red light, flashed by mercury switches, was put on to help abstract attention, while the whirring of the little electric motor was to create further mystery for the flier. Happening as it did at the beginning of the school year, this was probably the prank of some students.

FRICK PARK AREA, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA
15 September 1959

On 15 September 1959 the Pittsburgh police investigated a reported explosion in the Frick Park area of the city. The explosion was reported to have occurred at 2400 on 15 September 1959. During the investigation the police discovered an unidentified object in the area of the reported explosion. The object was conically shaped, and the body was of polyethylene plastic, yellow in color. Three wires extending like an antenna were found near the top just below a red light. Attached to the side was a "D" bolt with two feet or 1/4" cable attached to it with 1/2" bolts. The weight of the object was twelve pounds. The object was burned around the edge of the base.

During inspection of the object attempts were made to open it without destroying it, but this proved impossible. Under the plastic coat, which averaged 1/2" in thickness, was a thin sheet of aluminum with the same general contours. Contained in the aluminum were some following items, all embodied in a glue-like substance which was used to fill the interior:

a. Hilco Huntlite lantern battery container with switch.
b. Steel pipe (threaded both ends) 2 1/2" long and 1 3/4" diameter.
c. Eight Ray-O-Vac Flashlight batteries (four in the battery container).
d. Two mercury switches.
e. Tiny atom 1/2000 horsepower electric motor (Wilson's of Cleveland).
f. Transformer (Federal Telephone and Radio Corporation, Boonton, N. J.).

The batteries, mercury switches, electric motor, and light bulb were all wired; however, the electric motor was not connected mechanically to anything. The antenna and transformer were not a part of the circuit.

Wilson's of Cleveland, manufacturers of the tiny atom electric motor, when contacted concerning the motor indicated that their chief outlets were hobby shops.

In view of the relatively great weight, inaccessibility, overall lack of any hydraulic function, and crudeness this object is truly not a device designed to collect atmospheric data.

All evidence indicates that this object was not airborne at any time. An object traveling twelve yards would not approach this area. An explosive attribute, however, was left an impression in the ground which would have been noticed during investigation. Further indication that the object had not fallen was the fact that the light bulb and fragile plastic cover were found intact.

It is the Air Force conclusion that this object and the explosion were all part of a hoax. The red light, flashed by mercury switches, and the whirring of the little electric motor were designed to create further mystery for the finder. Since this incident happened at the beginning of the school term, this was probably a prank of college students.
