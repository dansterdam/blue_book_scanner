PROJECT 10079 RECORD CARD

DATE: 2 Sep 52

LOCATION: TOKYO, JAPAN

DATE-TIME GROUP: 0525/15

SOURCE: ALCS Unit

LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 min - 1 Hour

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Target observed on PPI scope of GCA unit traveling nine miles north of Tokyo International Airport as speed 150-60 knots. Number of targets varied from one to three, did not hold formation. Blip size was similar to return from C-124, A/C. Target could not be sighted visually, although it was plotted to be at an altitude of less than 3000'.

COMMENTS:
1. Return could have been caused by migratory birds interfering with normal function of set.

CONCLUSIONS:
Was Balloon
Probably Meteor
Possibly Balloon

Was Aircraft
Probably Aircraft

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: ATTL Office, D/I FEAF                    REPORT NO. IR-40-52         PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES

1. The following letter concerning radar contact with unidentified objects was received from the 1503rd Air Transport Wing (MATS), APO 226:

SOURCE: M/Sgt. Joseph H. Wehling AF 3734)833 1956-1 AACS Detachment, NCOTC, OGA Team, Tokyo International Airport (Haneda ARB).

SUMMARY: At 20:15 LST, 2 September 1952 source observed an unidentified target on the PPI scope of the OCA unit. When first observed the target was 9 miles north of the field traveling at an estimated speed of 1.6 to 60 miles per hour on a heading of 90°, at an altitude of 3000 feet or less (PPI scope does not give elevation). During the next hour the number of targets observed varied between one and three. The original target remained on the scope for 15 minutes while others were visible for a full hour.

The targets did not maintain formation.

Targets moved in various directions but remained in the NE quadrant from the field (0° to 90°).

The range of the targets varied from 16 miles to 1 1/4 mile from the field.

There was no aircraft traffic reported in the local area at the time of the sighting.

Source was unable to locate the targets by visual means.

The targets produced a clearly visible echo on the PPI scope about the size of that caused by a C-124 aircraft.

The weather at the time of the sighting was: Estimated 10,000 broken clouds, visibility 7 miles, wind from NW at 6 mph, temperature 60°, dew point 75°.

Shiroi AB (35 N 140 OE) stated that he was in telephone contact with the AC/W unit at the source base that the targets were picked up and the radar observers at that base also picked up the targets in the same area. It was the opinion of the source that the targets observed were birds. He could not however, account for the large echo produced by the targets.

(Reporting Officer's Comment) From a standpoint of pure speculation consideration might be given to the possibility that migratory birds which have arrived from an area where radically material or cloud are present would produce a radar echo greater than that normally expected.

This report was not forwarded by electrical means due to the low evaluation of the sightings and the delay in receipt of the report.

COMMENT BY PREPARING OFFICER:

1. Shiroi GCI is located approximately 22 miles Northeast of Haneda AFB. The objects in the Northeast quadrant from Haneda, would also be at close range to Shiroi, in the Southwest quadrant of that station.

2. The "S" band radar used for GCA Search and for GCI is not believed to be normally capable of picking up birds with sufficient return to be noticeable; however, it should be noted that for this period of the year (mid-August to October), the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry states that there are large numbers of

FROM (Agency)                     REPORT NO.                 PAGE      2     OF     2     PAGES

migratory birds in the Tokyo area. These birds, mostly SNIPE and PLOVER, grow to great size, and are often larger than eagles. They fly towards the South in groups of from 20 to 160. Their flights particularly take place from sunset to midnight and their altitude varies from 1000 to 10000 feet. On long distance flights the altitude is usually 6000 to 10000 feet, while the altitude when circling in local areas is generally much lower. In addition, local owls and hawks often circle in the areas near the land at night.

3. This contact was in approximately the same position as the contact on 5 Aug 52, and reported on FEAF IR-35-52, dated 12 Aug 52.

1. At 2015 LST, 2 September 1952, source observed an unidentified target on the ?21 scope of the GCA units. Then first observed the target was 9 miles north of the field travelling at an estimated speed of 120 to 150 mph on a heading of 90°, at an altitude of 3000 feet or less (PPI scope does not give elevations). During the next hour the number of targets observed varied between one and three. The original target remained on the scope for 15 minutes while others were visible for a full hour.

a. The targets did not maintain formation.

b. Targets moved in various directions but remained in the NE quadrant from the field (30° to 50°).

c. The range of the targets varied from 16 miles to 1/4 mile from the field.

d. There was no aircraft traffic reported in the local area at the time of the sighting.

e. Source was unable to locate the targets by visual means.

f. The targets produced a clearly visible echo on the PPI scope about the size of that caused by a C-124 aircraft.

g. The weather at the time of the sighting was: estimated 10,000 broken clouds, visibility 7 miles, wind from NW at 6 mph, temperature 30°, dew point 73°.

2. Source stated that he was in telephone contact with the AC&W unit at Shiroi AB (35 49N 140 01E) at the time targets were picked up. The radar observers at that base also picked up the targets in the same area. It was the conclusion of the source that the targets observed were similar, however, account for the large echo produced by the objects.

COMMENT OF PREPARING OFFICER: From a standpoint of pure speculation, consideration might be given to the possibility that radioactive material or clouds are present would produce a radar echo.

This report was not forwarded by electrical means due to the low evaluation of the sighting and the delay in receipt of the report.
