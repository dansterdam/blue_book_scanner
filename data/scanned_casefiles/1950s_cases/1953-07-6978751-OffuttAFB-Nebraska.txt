AF FORM 112—PART II "UNCLASSIFIED"
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: HQ 3902d AB WG
OFFUTT AFB NEBR

1. THREE UNIDENTIFIED RADAR BLIPS WERE SIGHTED BY THE RAWIN CREW AT OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE AT 2135C 20 JULY 1953. THE STRONGEST OF THE THREE BLIPS WAS TRACKED BY RADAR UNTIL 2146C 20 JULY 53.

2. THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS TRACKED BY RADAR WITH THE SCR-584 RADAR SET.

3. THE RADAR SET WAS LOCATED .55 MILES SOUTH OF THE INTERSECTION OF THE MAIN RUNWAY OF OFFUTT AFB. LOCATION OF THE OBJECT TRACKED ARE GIVEN ON THE ATTACHED DATA SHEET (INCL 1).

4. THE RAWIN CREW WHICH TRACKED THE OBJECT WERE S/SGT GEORGE A. DURRAY, AF 19307185 AND A/1C KENNETH F. SMITH, AF 15390477. BOTH ARE EXPERIENCED OPERATORS AND ARE CONSIDERED RELIABLE. THEY REPORTED THE STRENGTH OF THE RADAR RETURN FROM THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE RETURN FROM THE RAWIN TARGET. THE RAWIN TARGET USED CONSISTED OF A CARDBOARD FRAME APPROXIMATELY FIVE FEET SQUARE COVERED WITH ALUMINUM FOIL.

5. THE HOURLY WEATHER REPORT FROM OFFUTT AFB WEATHER STATION AT 2125C WAS 10 @ 160 W-75/50, W/NDS ALOFT TAKEN AT THE 2100C RAWIN RUN ARE INCLUDED IN ENCLOSURE 1.

6. NO METEOROLOGICAL EXPLANATION CAN BE GIVEN FOR THE SIGHTING. THE RAWIN CREW HAS SUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE TO IDENTIFY RAINSHOWER PRECIPITATION AS OPPOSED TO A RADAR RETURN FROM A SOLID OBJECT. A COMPARISON OF THE SPEED OF THE OBJECT WITH WINDS ALOFT SUGGESTS THAT THE OBJECT WAS FALLING AND DRIFTING WITH THE WIND. AT 2135C THE RAWIN TARGET WAS AT 55000 FEET AND THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS AT 45300 FEET.

7. NO PHOTOGRAPHS OR OTHER PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXISTS OF THE SIGHTING.

8. THE P-31 AIRCRAFT AC&W UNIT WAS INFORMED OF THE INITIAL SIGHTING AT 2140C. THEY WERE GIVEN THE SCR-584 DATA ON THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT AT THAT TIME AND A VERBAL REPORT WAS GIVEN TO THE AC&W UNIT AT ABOUT 2230C. THE AC&W UNIT WAS UNABLE TO GET A RETURN FROM THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT.

9. NO KNOWN TRAFFIC WAS REPORTED AT ALTITUDES FROM 25000 TO 35000 AT THE TIME OF THE ABOVE INCIDENT.

10. THIS HEADQUARTERS IS UNABLE TO EVALUATE THIS REPORT.
