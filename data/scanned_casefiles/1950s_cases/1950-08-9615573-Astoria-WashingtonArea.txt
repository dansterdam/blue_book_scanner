Brilliant Meteor Seen By Many Here Saturday

A brilliant meteor seen in broad daylight was reported by a number of Tacomas who seemingly were amazed to see such a sight shortly after the noon hour Saturday.

Among the callers to The Tacoma News Tribune office was Frank A. Reds of 5019 So. L, who said he and four neighbors saw a "silver streak" that looked like a rocket going southwest and leaving a trail. As they watched, it turned downward toward the earth and disappeared.

E. J. Moran of 9804 American Ave. S. W., said he saw an oblong object shoot down behind some trees and he thought it to be a crashing jet plane.

Others described it in various terms, some thinking they had seen a flying saucer, but all here who saw it were unanimous that it was going at terrific speed and appeared luminous even in daylight.

Tacoma, however, was not the only point of vantage as it was witnessed generally over the entire Pacific Northwest. Following is a report of the occurrence by The Associated Press:

A "ball of fire," visible even in the bright noon sunshine, streaked across Pacific Northwest skies yesterday (Saturday). Apparently it was a meteor.

It was seen from Salem north to Seattle, from Ellensburg in central Washington to Astoria on the Oregon coast.

It. flashed brilliantly. At Port Angeles a woman said it seemed brighter than the sun. Some observers said they even could see a blue tail. Others thought they detected silver and red colors on the fringe.

A science professor at Lewis and Clark college in Portland, Dr. A. A. Groening said it possibly was a straggler from the annual perseid shooting star display, which was at its height Aug. 11.

It was seen shortly after noon. A bar pilot at Astoria fixed the time at 12:06 p. m. there. He thought it descended toward the ocean northwest of Astoria.

A Seattle astronomer, Mrs. Bror Grondahl, thought it probably burned itself out before striking earth.

Emily's Eyes Can Spot
Elephants or Fireballs
By EMILY WALKER

When I was 5 years old, my mother took me after we had spent the summer in a little town born and raised. One incident we might have influenced my decision during the ensuing years.

We were riding home from a picnic in the country road bordered by fields of ripened corn. And I was watching the horizon, in the distance, an airplane. I knew it was a different type of aircraft.

Particularly when we had arrived at the time. After we had arrived home, we were telling my great-grandmother about the trip. Those who had been alone, about the picnic, were not there. The incident had for lunch. As an added bit of interest, I mentioned having seen an elephant.

My great-grandmother looked startled. "No," she said. "You know you didn't see an elephant. Of course you are just a child and children do imagine things." But I had been sitting beside me in the car. I knew what I did see. And, of course, in a child, she said, "we couldn't have seen an elephant." I knew I was right. I couldn't have been crushed. No one believed me.

Dear Dr. Arcier:

How very kind you have been to me in taking your very valuable time to investigate and report back to me so fully regarding what I really saw reflected in Puget Sound on that bright August day in 1950.

Never in my life had I heard of a fireball! Now I feel superior to my friends in that not only do I know what one is, but also I am among the few privileged to have seen one. In addition, I can, from now on, stand apart from my contemporaries, having elicited the cooperation of an eminent scientist.

With your permission, I shall use a substantial part of your letter in my weekly Sunday column to the Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune, probably next week. I shall send you a clipping.

Again, many thanks, Dr. Arcier. I feel it was a great privilege to have met you and I truly hope our paths may somehow bring us together again.

Sincerely yours,

The information given you is in no way classified, so there is no objection to your using it in your regular Sunday column.

I will be very glad indeed to receive a clipping.

Dear Miss Walker:

Here is my reply to your letter of 27 June 1958 regarding an unusual sighting observed by you and a large number of people in the Tacoma area on 20th and other parts of Washington on the 20th of August 1950 at noon.

Our records indeed indicate that there was a UFO reported from Washington State, and at precisely this time on 20 August 1950. Our records of investigation and analysis indicate the following:

a. The object was a seldom-seen phenomenon, a bolide, as it is referred to in scientific terminology. Bolides, more commonly known as "fireballs" are a form of meteorite.

b. The earth was just passing through the Perseids, an annual meteoric shower, at that time.

c. The identity of the object was confirmed by the independent review of private scientists.

A point of explanation is in order here, [redacted] to clarify things. Fireballs, unlike smaller meteorites, generally do not burn up in the earth's upper atmosphere, but remain intact, as a large, glowing mass until they disintegrate at lower levels or strike the earth. These bodies seem to appear more often during meteoric showers. Records indicate that the majority of people never see one in their lifetime, and an encounter with one can indeed be a startling experience.


- page 7 -

The subject of fireballs and meteors has been studied extensively by the University of Pennsylvania under Dr. [illegible], Professor Emeritus of that institute. I am taking the liberty of sending you excerpts of certain portions of Dr. [illegible]'s report on Fireball, which, I think, you may find of interest. As may be seen from his 35-year survey, the largest number of meteors and fireballs appear in August.

The incident which you so kindly sent me is so similar to the "fireball" incident that happened a few months ago, that I am sending you two excerpts from our Case Files. If you recall, the "Great Western Fireball" incident of 1957 drew nationwide notice from the press, radio and TV. The fireball was observed by hundreds of persons, including pilots in the air, simultaneously from six states.

I need hardly state that a large number of observers are still firmly unconvinced that the object was a "fireball."

May I again thank you for the courtesies extended the Air Force representatives, and for your sincere interest and understanding in the matter.

Sincerely yours,
A. FRANCIS ARCHER
Scientific Advisor

Dear Dr. Arcier:

Perhaps you will remember me as being the only woman who was present at the briefing in which you participated on June 20, in the office of Congressman John E. Henderson of Ohio. I was there representing Congressman Tollefson who was out of town.

You will find enclosed photostatic copies of two articles which appeared in the Tacoma, Washington News Tribune & Sunday Ledger. These give the details in regard to the incident I related to you after the briefing session.

The Article which appeared August 20, 1950, was printed the day following the one one when I wrote the article which appeared a week later.

You very kindly offered to look back in the files and try to determine for me what if any record and/or explanation the Airforce has on this incident. I shall be looking forward to hearing from you on this matter.

Sincerely yours,
