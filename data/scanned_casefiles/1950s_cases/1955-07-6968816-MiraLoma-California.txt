Flight 16, 4602d AISS

I. SOURCE:
Address: Mira Loma, California.
Age: 25 yrs.
Occupation: Reliefman in a canning factory and odd shift ground observer.

Education: Completed High School and a Radio-Electronics Course in a Technical School.

Qualifications: Member of the Ground Observer Corps.

II. RELIABILITY: Poor. In a personal interview, source displayed a lack of understanding of speed and distance. He seemed to be rather hesitant and unsure of himself although he was relaxed during the interview.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was on duty at the Glen Avon Ground Observer Post at the time of sighting which was 0905½ July 1955. The night was dark, dry and clear, with many stars out but no moon nor wind. The single object appeared very bright like an automobile headlight a few feet away.

A. The object did not appear to make any erratic movements, nor change shape or flicker.

B. The object appeared to be solid and did not move behind anything but source was not sure if it moved in front of anything while being observed within any visual aids.

C. Source insisted that he could see the earth's curvature, and described the object's flight path as a flat horizontal plane above the earth's curvature. (source did not wear glasses).

D. Source's opinion of object's size changed from his original estimated size of a half-dollar to that of a quarter held in the hand at arms length. It continued on out of observers' range of vision at approximately 40° from the horizon. This elevation was maintained during the complete sighting.

E. Source stated that at one time before he had reported a star to be an unidentified flying object but was fairly certain that the object he saw on 9 July 1955 was not a star.

Inclosure #1, Part One, Report #1G-UFOB-10-55. Statement of

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

While looking in a Southeasterly direction, I saw an object which appeared to be a meteor, but in the thirty-five (35) seconds of which it was observed, I traveled a horizontal plain. I considered this to be unusual.

I reported this to the Filter Center, Pasadena, California (EWB 5705) immediately. Object was brilliant with white and seemed to have a slight tail which while traveling changed colors from white to red to a hazy light blue. It covered a four mile span in thirty (30) seconds - approximately 4,800 miles per hour. I lost sight of object in the extreme Southeast.

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. A check with 6th Weather Group, Det 7, Norton AFB, San Bernardino, California, the Long Beach and Riverside, California, weather stations contained the following information:

a. A temperature inversion of five (5) degrees Centigrade existed at this time between the altitudes of 1800 feet and 4700 feet. The temperature at 1500 feet was 15 degrees B. and the temperature at 4700 feet was 20 degrees C.

b. Winds aloft are indicated below:

[Wind table with columns for Altitude (in feet), Wind Direction (in degrees), and Wind Speed (in knots)]

2. Dr. BOWEN, Chief Astronomer of the Mt. Wilson Observatory was interviewed to check on the possibility of meteors in the Hollywood and Riverside areas. Dr. Bowen explained that all of their observers are inside the observatories and the field of vision of their equipment is extremely limited. Therefore, the possibility of sighting such objects would be highly improbable. There were no significant meteors at any time during the night of 9 July 1955 at Mt. Wilson or Palomar Observatories, nor could any astronomical conclusions explain the three reported sightings by Lt. DUNN.

3. George BRATTLE, Professor of Astronomy, San Bernardine Valley College, was interviewed to determine the possible conclusions of the sightings in this report. He could offer no help as the information, in his opinion, was contradictory and unreliable in all three sightings with this exception: the moon was rising during the time period of these three sightings and a possible optical phenomenon might explain the reported sightings by Lt. DUNN.

Flight 1-9, 4602d AISS

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the reliability of the observers in these three sightings existed from "poor" to "fair" and that these were three separate and distinct sightings. No clear-cut conclusions can be made about any one of the three sightings because there were only single observer sightings of each of the objects in question.

2. The following possibilities are given: Sighting referred to in Part One is a possible optical phenomena (refer to paragraphs a and b below).
   a. Sighting referred to in Parts Two and Three are possible meteorological sightings.

a. The fact that a five (5) degree temperature inversion did exist during the time of the sightings. (Refer to paragraph 1 of Part Four of this report.) can account for possible optical phenomena.

b. The mean rise during this period could have caused reflections and adds to the theory of an optical phenomena.

c. The time span of the observations cited in Parts Two and Three can be correlated with the length of time which is normally observed, thus lending weight to the possibility that these observations were of meteors.

Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the three (3) sightings described above are separate and distinct sightings, with conclusions of each as indicated below:

a. Sighting by Ernest L. Dunn, Glen Avon Ground Observer Post, Riverside, California: Possibly optical phenomena.

b. Sighting by Larry C. Spears, Arlington Ground Observer Post, Arlington, California: Possibly astronomical.

c. Sighting by Albert DeLonz, Hollywood Ground Observer Post, Hollywood, California: Possibly astronomical.
