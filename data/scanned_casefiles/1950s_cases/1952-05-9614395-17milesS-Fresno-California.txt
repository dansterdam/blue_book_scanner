Dear Sir:-

I understand that the Air Force has requested that any mysterious objects seen in the sky be reported. Over the Memorial Day weekend, I had the following experience while driving along to Los Angeles:

At 8:30 a.m. on 30 May 1952, I was on Highway 99, about 17 miles south of Fresno. A strange object was arrested by a glimmering object in the sky that caused me to look up. I desire to give direction - I desire that an approximate degree and description of the object be given. As I was driving west, the object was at the edge of my windshield till the time it appeared to become extinguished almost directly west. I have no idea how far distant it was. However, the visual image of the object was about the size of a tennis ball. It was yellow in color. The times were bright and clear. When I first saw the object, it was higher than the diameter of the object which was yellow in color.

The object was certainly no ordinary meteorite because of its size and color. Furthermore, it seemed to me that it moved more slowly and in a manner being visible to me during the entire time.

It seems likely to me that on this highway must have been the only person who saw this object. If so, the time may serve to corroborate any other reports that the Air Force may receive on this occurrence.

Very truly yours,

[Signature redacted]
