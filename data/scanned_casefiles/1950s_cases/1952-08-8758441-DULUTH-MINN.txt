11. CONCLUSIONS: [Checked boxes indicate]
- Was Balloon
- Probably Balloon

29. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?
(Circle One): Yes or No

29.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too?
(Circle One): Yes or No

29.2 Please list their names and addresses:

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper if necessary.

Since I have taken pilot balloon observations for 25 years, I know that the phenomenon was not one usually observed. The position did not change in the theodolite for a full minute. With respect to movement this leaves three possibilities for that minute: 1- The object did not move; 2- The object climbed at 20.0° above the horizontal in the direction of 237.5°; 3- The object descended at 20.0° above the horizontal in the direction of 237.5°.

Since moving the theodolite caused the object to move across the field of vision it probably could not have been caused by any defect in the instrument.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: 73rd Air Base Squadron    FILE NO: IR-9-532c    PAGE 1 OF 3 PAGES

Weather Bureau Airport Station, Duluth, Minnesota, August 7, 1952

REPORT BY U.S. WEATHER BUREAU METEOROLOGIST OF LIGHT SEEN IN PILOT BALLOON OBSERVATION
THEODOLITE.

During the routine afternoon pilot balloon observation taken on August 7, 1952, a small white light appeared in the theodolite. The light was approximately one nautical mile from the theodolite and along half as high as the theodolite. The third dimension was not well defined, or originated on, the field of vision. The light now was than the light moved into, or originated on, the field of vision. The light as to its small size is was noticed only by accident.

In following the drift of the balloon the movement of the theodolite caused the small light to move across the field of vision. Since I watched the light in the field of vision I left the balloon pass out of the field, and I brought the theodolite back to the center of the field. Then I moved the theodolite to the light during the minute when I had it centered in the theodolite field. The estimated angle remained at 237.3 degrees, and the observation angle was 22.0 degrees.

I have no estimate to give concerning the actual size of the object, or of its distance from the station.

In attempting to fulfill my purpose of observing (the pilot balloon) I moved the theodolite to the position where I expected to find the balloon. Then I immediately moved it back to 237.3 nautical miles. However, I then could not find the light. I actually observed the light for somewhat more than two minutes from 1950 to 1953.

Winds aloft computed from this observation, given in thousands of feet MSL, degrees from north, and in knots were: 2-200-17, 3-220-10, 4-210-11, 5-250-19, 6-250-16, 7-250-46, 8-210-20, 9-240-13, 10-200-10, 12-230-17, 14-222-12, 15-240-19, 16-250-15.

I do not know whether the light was reflected from some object, or if it had its own source of light. The light was observed and north, but no crawling. I was near enough so that I could not define its borders.

Since moving the theodolite caused the light to move across the field of vision I know that the light was not caused by any film in any part of the instrument.

No publicity was given the observing of this phenomenon.
