Dear Sir:

Reference is made to your letter of 24 December 1952 to Capt E. J. Ruppelt. Unfortunately, this letter was misrouted causing some delay. The piece of material you forwarded has been analyzed at the Aerial Phenomena Research Laboratory. Tooth, tentatively and mineralogically the specimen bears a strong resemblance to very basic slag from an open-hearth furnace.

The specimen will be returned to you under separate cover within the next week.

Your action in forwarding this sample is appreciated.

Yours very truly,

Attention Capt. E. J. Ruppelt

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter concerns our examination of a sample handed to me about a month ago by Capt. McQuown. This sample appeared to be ceramic in character, and was reported to have been picked up at a location not indicated. It was requested that a determination be made as to whether it was a synthetic material or whether its was of meteoric origin. Two polished surfaces were examined in reflected polarized light and two thin sections were studied in transmitted polarized light.

Neither the texture nor the mineralogical composition of the specimen is comparable with the texture and mineralogical composition of known stony meteorites. On the other hand, this cursory examination indicates that both texturally and mineralogically the specimen bears a strong resemblance to very basic slag from an open-hearth furnace. The five principal phases in the specimen have been tentatively identified as tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, calcium ferrite, ferrous oxide, and metallic iron.

It is considered that these data fulfill the requirements of the request.

Sincerely,

1. Enclosures (1) through (7) are statements and drawings submitted to Intelligence Officer, U.S. Naval Air Facility, Port Lyautey, French Morocco, regarding sightings of a brilliant white aerial object on the evenings of 6 an 7 August 1952 in the vicinity of Port Lyautey. The observation of this brilliant "flying object" was made by an aircraft pilot of Air Transport Squadron Twenty Four (VR-24), based at Port Lyautey, and was confirmed by observation from the airfield control tower and the ground.

2. In addition to enclosure (1) LT GREEN stated that the object sighted appeared to be about the size of his small fingernail and positively much larger than a star or plane.

3. LT DOBBS corroborated enclosures (2), (3) and (4) carefully stating that he had observed in chemistry in color or white on chart "has any white he had written he thought possible. In addition he stated that the blinking...

I.O. NAF Port Lyautey, P.M. ser 1-R-52 of 15 August 1952

Lights were a very intense red. IT DOES further stated that from the position of his aircraft he could see what the object passed between Port Lyautey and Rabat (21.6 miles apart).

4. The log book of NAF tower had this aircraft off the ground at 1951 local, 7 August. A later entry stated that the object in question was observed by two tower operators to pass to the SW, turn sharply, and proceed to the SE.

5. On the night of 3 August, cameramen were stationed at NAF tower and aircraft in the area were instructed to keep a lookout for unusual objects. Results of these measures were negative.

6. Weather observations of Fleet Weather Central, Port Lyautey, both surface and upper air, for 4-5 August are forwarded (with original only) as enclosure (7). These observations show that weather for the period was generally excellent with high or unlimited ceilings and good visibility.

7. Referring to enclosures (2), (3) and (5), rough computation shows that the speed of the object must have been more than 4000 miles per hour.

I.O. Comment: The officers who sighted this "flying saucer" object are experienced in aerial observation. While bordering on the incredible, this report is submitted as the first direct observation in recent locality of what is generally termed to be "flying saucers". Similar reports have been noted in the recent past in local French newspapers. While the possibilities of the object being another aircraft or a "shooting star" have been ruled out, no final conclusion has been reached as to the identification or significance of the object sighted.

I.O. NAF Port Lyantey, F.M. ser 1-R-52 of 15 August 1952 (Enclosure 1)

STATEMENT OF LT C. B. GREEN

On the night of August 6, 1952 while standing in the squadron area of VR-24 about 2300, I saw a brilliant round white light going on a course of about 230 degrees. It left a white, smoke-like trail which lasted until after the object itself was gone. I have seen F-86's and F-94's in races and can safely say it was going far faster than any of these.

I.O. NAF Port Lyantey, F.M. ser 1-R-52 of 15 August 1952 (Enclosure 2)

STATEMENT OF LT. D. M. DOBBS

On a routine night training flight in F3D 5865 on 7 August 1952, the following incident was observed. I was in the pilot's seat. Lt Foster was in the co-pilot seat and in the area sending in the area between us two.

After a normal takeoff from runway 030, and a climb to 5,000 feet on a heading of 270 degrees, we decided to reverse course and go to Sidi Slimane Air Force Base. On a heading of 110 degrees, Lt Foster and I observed a brilliant white light traversing the right front windshield and continuing to our rear. The speed to be at altitude which at that time was 4,500 feet. From first sighting until the object was to our rear, the time was approximately two seconds. I turned, keeping the object in sight until I was on a heading of 270 degrees. The object was flying in a same direction. As I started to climb toward it, the object slimbed upward at a terrific rate of speed. First a shell-like angle, then a very steep angle, continuing very steep until at that time I was only a faint bright light. Altitude at the exact time I estimate to be 15,000 feet. It was at the top of high scattered cirrus clouds.

During this time, Lt Foster contacted Port Lyantey tower, giving our position and the object's position. At first the tower did not see the object, but when we said its was on a course of 270 degrees and definitely gave our position as slightly south of the field, he also sighted the object and kept track of it as we did. We talked to the tower stating size, brightness, speed and altitude.

After the object had almost disappeared on a heading of 270 degrees, it turned sharply across our path. I again turned toward the object, continuing my climb toward it. At this time I noticed a very bright disc center - brighter than white phosphorus - with two definite blinking red lights. The red blinking lights appeared to be on wingtips, but I could see no wings. Only the bright glow of alternately blinking lights. At this time, the object seemed to hover and descend downward as I continued to climb toward it. It then started up and away from us.

I was for following the object, but Lt Foster suggested that we turn away from it and continue to Sidi Slimane because I would have been impossible to catch up, due to the terrific rate of speed and acceleration characteristics.

The glow was so bright that I do not believe it could have been made by one of our jets flying at night. The tower informed us that there was another aircraft in the vicinity; however we located this other aircraft north of the field. I definitely recognized the plane, seeing its blinking red and green lights, and comparatively slow movement.

We then continued on to Sidi Slimane where we practiced GCA approaches. We returned to base at about 2325.

I.C. NAF Port Lyantey, F.A. ser 1-R-52 of 15 August 1952 (Enclosure 6)

STATEMENT OF LT. W. FOSTER - 7 AUGUST

At 2020 I observed a brilliant white light passing from port to starboard. I was on a heading of 110 degrees. I remarked to the other pilot who had seen the same thing. The object was travelling at an unusual speed. We turned to the heading 110 degrees. The object was approximately 10 knots. The light grew its very rapidly. We turned to our original heading, and in making the turn we were circled by this object. At this time I noticed that two red lights were blinking very rapidly. The object then departed on a bearing of approximately 230 degrees and went out of sight very rapidly.
