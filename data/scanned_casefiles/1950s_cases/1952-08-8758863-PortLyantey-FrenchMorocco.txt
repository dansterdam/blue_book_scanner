Attention Capt. E. J. Ruppelt

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter concerns our examination of a sample handed to me about a month ago by Capt. McGovern. This sample appeared to be ceramic in character, and was reported to have been picked up at a location not indicated. The material was requested to have a determination made of its mineralogical origin. Due to its strange nature, it was examined by metallurgical methods, and two thin sections were studied in transmitted polarized light.

Neither the texture nor the mineralogical composition of the specimen is consistent with the texture and mineralogical composition of natural materials. This cursory examination indicates that both texturally and mineralogically the specimen bears a strong resemblance to very basic slag from an open-hearth furnace. The five principal phases in the specimen have been tentatively identified as a triclinic silicate, dicalcium silicate, calcium ferrite, ferrous oxide, and metallic iron.

It is considered that these data fulfill the requirements of the request.

Sincerely,

Howard C. Gross

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PRESENTED FROM SIGHTING OF 7 AUGUST 1952.

A. THREE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED OVER THE PORT LYAUTEY AREA BY TWO PILOTS OF VR-24 WHO WERE RETURNING FROM FLIGHTS THAT EVENING. AFTER THEIR FIRST SIGHTING, THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED IN FLIGHT TO THE SOUTH OF PORT LYAUTEY FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES. THEIR SPEED WAS ESTIMATED AT 600-700 KNOTS. THEY SHOWED NO LIGHTS AND MADE NO SOUND. AT ONE TIME THREE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED, AT OTHERS ONLY TWO - THEY MANEUVERED IN A TIGHT FORMATION AND APPEARED TO BE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL. NO CONCLUSION AS TO IDENTITY OR SIGNIFICANCE.

The image does not contain any photographs. The provided text is a written report from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The report describes an incident that occurred on August 1-2, 1952 at Port Lyautey, French Morocco, where observers reported seeing a very intense red light in the sky. The report provides details about the sighting, including the objects' movements and the weather conditions at the time. There is no image or photograph included in this particular page of the report.

I.O. MAF Port Lyautey, P.M. 1-2-52 of 15 August 1952

Lights were a very intense red. IT bears further stated that from the location of the observer the object appeared to be behind Port Lyautey and had taken (21.6 miles apart).

A later study of the MAF radar logs at this aircraft off the ground on the 1st August 1952 between 23:45 and 00:15 hours. A later entry stated that the object in question was observed by two tower operators to pass to the SHY after hovering for 50 minutes.

On the night of 2 August, cameramen were stationed at AF tower and aircraft in the area were activated to keep a 30 minute, for unusual objects. Despite these measures, no further sightings were recorded.

Weather observed from a Fleet Weather Central, Port Lyautey, both surface and upper-air, for the period indicated (4-12 August 1952) are enclosed (7 p.). The observations show that weather for this period was generally excellent with high or variable ceilings and good visibility.

Referring to enclosures (2), (3) and (5), rough computation shows that the speed of the object must have been more than XOOO miles per hour.

I.O. Comments: The officers who sighted this "flying saucer" object were experienced in normal observations, ship handling & flight operations. This report is submitted as the first direct observation as nearly as what is normally available. The object appeared to be larger than an aircraft, possibly another aircraft or a "chasing star". There have been other similar observations concerning the identification or significance of the object sighted.

STATEMENT OF LT. GR. B. GREEN

On the night of August 6, 1952 while standing in the squadron area (VR-24, about 2300), I saw a brilliant round white light going on a course of about 250 degrees. It left a white, smoke-like trail which lasted until after the object itself was gone. I have seen T-33's and P-94's in action and can safely say it was going far faster than any of these.

STATEMENT OF LT. D. M. DECCO

On a routine night training flight in F8D scars on 7 August 1952, the following incident was observed. I was in the pilots seat and Lt. Orr was in the co-pilot seat as we climbed to a nut uder 9,000 feet on a 270 degree heading. 

After about a quarter hour, we decided to reverse course and go to 8111 Silvas Air Force Base in the Palm Springs area. I observed a brilliant white light traversing the right front windshield and continuing to our right. It appeared to be on a collision course with our plane. It was moving at a speed of approximately 1,500 feet per second. I turned, keeping the object in sight until I was on a heading of 270 degrees. The object then began to climb rapidly. As I started to climb toward it, the object climbed at a terrific rate of speed, then made a sharp turn and disappeared from sight. First an analysis of this incident under ordinary conditions would place the object's speed at approximately 1,500 feet per second. Altitude of the object at this time I estimate to be 15,000 feet. 

During this time Lt. Foster contacted Port Lyautey tower, giving our position and stating that we had an unidentified object. At this time the tower did not see the object but when we said it was on a course of 270 degrees, and definitely at the altitude we gave, it was suggested to us that it could be a balloon from a Soviet weather station. However, the object we saw had a very brilliant white light, with some reddish lights, and was definitely moving with no discernible upper or lower limits and altitude.

After the object had almost disappeared on a heading of 270 degrees, it turned sharply to the left, then to the right, and then dropped down, the whole maneuver being brighter than white phosphorus, and with two definite blinking red lights. The object blinked 3 to 4 times and then disappeared. I could see no wings or other aircraft characteristics. At this time, the object seemed to be only the bright glow of alternately blinking lights. At this time, the object seemed to have disappeared and I continued to climb toward it. It then started up and away from us.

It was following the object, but Lt. Foster suggested that we turn away from it and continue to 8111 Silvas because it would have been impossible to catch up with it due to the terrific rate of speed and acceleration characteristics.

The glow was so bright that I do not believe it could have been made by one of our planes or satellites. The tower reported an unidentified object north of the field, definitely, however we located this object directly in front of us. It was blinking red and green lights, and comparative slow movements.

We then continued on to 8111 Silvas where we practiced GCA approaches. We returned to base at about 2325.

STATEMENT OF LT M. FOSTER - 7 AUGUST 

At 2020 I was flying in a heading of 110 degrees. I remarked to the other pilot who had seen the same thing. The object appeared to be traveling at a tremendous speed. We turned to the bearing and it was traveling. Our speed was increased to approximately 180 knots. The light gray air was extremely clear. We started to close the range but as we did so the object ahead of us started increasing its speed. We tried to close the range further but it was impossible. The object then departed on a bearing of approximately 135 degrees. The object was then moving at an extremely high rate of speed.
