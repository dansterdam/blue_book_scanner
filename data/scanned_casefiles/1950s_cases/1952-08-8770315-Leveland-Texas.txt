Report No. IR-67-52

Subject: UNKONWN OBJECT

1. On 24 August 1952 between the hours of 2130 and 2400, (3) unidentified objects were sighted. The objects sighted were approximately twenty (20) miles southwest of Levelland, Texas. The first object sighted hovered in mid-air for approximately twenty (20) minutes and was observed by two (2) separate observers. It took approximately three (3) minutes for public realization.

The observers generally that objects when first sighted seemed to be at approximately one (1) mile altitude after objects were sighted at about Alamogordo, New Mexico, would vary of size. Object objects settled a constant slow changing does a set to yellow and then blue.

The informant and wife was under the opinion that the base of objects had been low stream of vapor to ascend. Objects were both a shrill sound and a whistling sound. All (3) objects were approximately 30 to 35 feet in diameter and no estimate of thickness of object was made.

Manner of disappearance of objects: Object was hovering in mid-air then a sudden and final rush, very rapid movement and continued to gain altitude out of sight of observers.

2. Objects were sighted between the hours of 2130 and 2400, 24 August 1952.

3. Objects were viewed with naked eye.

4. Observation took place at 5000 3735 in the city of Levelland, Texas. Object appeared north northwest with a observation at a practically four (4) city (5) mile east southeast of Levelland. The only reasonable location was a watchtower approximately six (6) blocks due west point of observation.

5. Information concerning the reliability and experience of the observers is limited to this observation and cannot be fully evaluated by this organization.

6. The weather condition at 2130 hours, 24 August 1952 was clear, temperature 81 degrees (F), wind calm, visibility unlimited.

7. At 2100 hours this station cleared a weather balloon. Weather station disclosed that weather balloon had a north southeast heading to 16,000 feet.

8. Physical evidence such as fragments, photographs, etc. were not noted.

9. No interception or identification made.

10. No evidence of any air traffic in the general area at time of sighting.

Comment (AFR): Time of sighting not specified
in msg recd AFOIN-SAY or clear read possible
since msg status "sighted first obj for one
hour, 3d Aug 52". If this activity was one
obs. lasted one hour, F 51 ruled out. On
other hand, if it was supposed to be
time of sighting but was not possible,
could be F 51. Suggest you request time
