AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
IX-67-52
DATE: 8 AUG. 1952
SUBJECT: Analysis of the U F O reported at LEVELLAND, TEXAS, on 2 Nov 1952.
1. This is a report concerning the Unidentified Flying Object sighted in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas, on the night of 2 November 1952.
2. Observation details: At approximately 2030 hours on 2 November 1952, several reports were received from persons in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas, concerning the sighting of a strange object in the sky. Levelland is a small town located approximately 30 miles southwest of Lubbock, Texas, situated on State Highway 116. The object was first sighted by a local farmer near Levelland who reported that as he was driving his pickup truck along the highway, the motor and lights of the vehicle suddenly went out. At the same time, he observed a large, glowing object descend to a point just above the road in front of him. The object was estimated to be about 200-300 feet in diameter, oval in shape, and colored orange or reddish-orange. After hovering for several minutes, the object rose rapidly and disappeared to the southwest. Similar reports were received from other persons in the area who experienced the same peculiar effect on their vehicles and observed the strange object in the sky.
3. Investigational details: An Air Force investigational team was sent to Levelland to make a field investigation of the incident on 3-4 November 1952. During the course of this investigation, the following additional details were obtained:
a. It was determined that the object was observed by at least 6 persons in the immediate Levelland area between the hours of 2030 and 2300 on 2 November 1952. All of the observers reported that their vehicles (automobiles and pickup trucks) were affected in the same manner when the object was in close proximity - the motors and lights suddenly went out, and were restored to normal operation as the object moved away.
b. The object was described as being oval or egg-shaped, approximately 200-300 feet in diameter, and glowing with a brilliant orange or reddish-orange color. No details of the object's surface or structure were observed, other than its general shape and color.
c. The object was observed to be hovering at a height of 20-50 feet above the ground, and moved in a horizontal direction at a slow rate of speed, estimated at 10-15 mph. As the object moved away, it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight to the southwest.
d. Several of the observers stated that they experienced a strange tingling sensation or "static electricity" effect in the vicinity of the object.
4. Conclusion: This incident is considered to be of significant interest from an intelligence point of view, in that it represents one of the few "close-range" observations of an Unidentified Flying Object made under apparently reliable conditions. The fact that several independent observers reported the same peculiar effects on their vehicles lends credence to the reliability of the reports. However, the Air Force has been unable to arrive at a positive identification or explanation for the object sighted. Speculation as to the nature and origin of the object continues.
