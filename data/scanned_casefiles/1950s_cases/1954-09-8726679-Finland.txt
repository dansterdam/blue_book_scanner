Some Department - 7 Sep 54
A 27 year old mason and his assistant observed a "flying saucer" at 0715 hrs, 7 Sep 54. The object was grey and was observed hovering over a field about 200 meters from the observers. The object oscillated slowly and seemed to have a closed door on its side. When the men had run about 50 meters toward it, the object began to fly away. Since was then visible from a sort of exhaust pipe on the underside. After an oblique flight of about 15 meters, the object rose vertically and disappeared. No trace of the object was found by police. The object was about 10 meters in diameter and 3 meters in height, did not glow and departed noislessly, trailing smoke. Visible for about 3 minutes. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN

Alpes Department - 7 Sep 54
A luminous red orange disc observed by three persons. The disk stopped suddenly 300-400 meters from the ground. It seemed to have on its upper side a small luminous tail forming an integral part of the object. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Italy - 14 Sep 54
Two inhabitants of Pitigliano report sighting of a round, white object making a strange, loud noise. The object came to a stand still and then disappeared at high speed. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data

Rome - 17 Sep 54

Netherlands - 4 Aug 54

Ten firemen observed two "flying saucers" over the Hague on the magic of 4 August between 2300 and 2400 hours. They moved at incredible speed, at times remaining motionless for as long as 30 seconds. They were flat ovals with a whitish gray light. ATIC Eval: Possible searchlight beam.

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked increase in UFO sightings throughout Europe. ATIC continues an inquiry of these sightings to two basic reasons.

1. The European press has been quick to publish, in detail, two sightings which resulted in great public interest and personal publicity.

2. Mr. D. Keyhoe's book was recently translated into various foreign languages and was on sale at newspapers throughout Europe during the summer of 1954.
