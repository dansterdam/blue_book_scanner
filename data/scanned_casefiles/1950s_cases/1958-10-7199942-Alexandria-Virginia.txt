UFO OBSERVERS INSTRUCTION SHEET
(Sky Diagram)

1. GENERAL:

a. The diagram represents all of the sky normally visible to the observer, who is pictured standing under the center of the "dome" of the sky. It is designed to show a three-dimensional view of the area centered around the observer at the time of the UFO sighting.

b. The position of any object in the sky can be described by giving its elevation, or angle (UNWAY) from the horizon, and its bearing or angle along the horizon, eastward from north.

(1) Illustrations:

(a) Elevation is 0 degrees for an object on the horizon, and 90 degrees for the point directly over the observer (zenith). Thus, an object half-way up from the horizon to the zenith has an elevation of 45 degrees.

(b) Bearing (or "azimuth") is the angle along the horizon, starting from north and moving clockwise eastward. Thus, an object directly toward the east, no matter what its elevation is above the horizon, has a bearing of 90 degrees, an object in the south has a bearing of 180 degrees toward the west, 270 degrees and so on. North is, of course, zero.

EXAMPLE: An object is seen in the northeast and one-third way up from horizon to overhead. Thus, the object has a bearing of 45 degrees, and elevation of 30 degrees. Similarly, an object having a bearing of 180 degrees and an elevation of 60 degrees would be seen directly south and two-thirds of the way up from the horizon.

2. PLOTTING THE COURSE OF AN OBJECT ON THE SKY DIAGRAM:

a. The path of an object across the sky can be shown completely on this diagram simply by connecting with a curved or straight line the various positions the object successively occupies (see example sheet). To aid visualization, the path on the western side of the sky is represented by broken lines; the eastern side in solid lines. Direction of the object is indicated by arrows. The duration of the sighting can be shown by indicating the time at the position, where the object was first and last observed. Where possible, the time at various intermediate positions should also be shown.

b. The diagram can be made a more effective investigative and analytical tool by making the lines (showing the path of the object) thicker or thinner to indicate any varying brightness of the object observed. This is especially valuable when the object appeared only as a moving light at night. Thus, if a light becomes bright and then gradually fades, it can be represented by a line becoming increasingly thicker and then gradually thinning out to nothing.

c. Use of colored pencils is especially recommended if the object changes color or hue during the sighting.

COVER SHEET UNCLASSIFIED

SUBJECT: (C) UFO Sighting, Alexandria, Va. (Mr. [redacted])

TO: SAFIS-3, Attn: Maj. Tacker
FROM: AFOIN-4F

DATE: 26 Nov. 1958
COMMENT NO. 1

COMMENTS:

1. On 7 October 1958, Mr. [redacted], Special Assistant to The Secretary of Defense for Research and Development, of Alexandria, Virginia, reported seeing an Unidentified Flying Object at 1810, daylight time. The object was observed for approximately 50 seconds and described as being bright, an oblate spheroid with an annulus around the circumference and approximately 600' in its longest dimension (subtended an angle of 3 degrees at 3 miles). Object was stationary for approximately 10 seconds and then disappeared by moving away from the witness. Mr. [redacted] was the only witness to report this phenomena.

2. The opinion of the ATIC is that Mr. [redacted] was victim of an illusion created by the reflection of the sun from either ice crystals or a very thin cloud far the sun lowered behind the horizon it illuminated less and less of the reflector, the decrease in size creating the illusion of motion. The wind had a component which was generally toward the north; therefore, the reflector drifting toward the witness could help account for the apparent increase in altitude. (This is not, however, considered a major factor.)

3. The fact that the object was reported as first stationary then moving lends to the above conclusion. There would be no apparent motion until reflected light began to noticeably diminish. Further weight is lent to this conclusion by the fact that this object was reported as being approximately 600' in length. The investigation failed to uncover another witness.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. [redacted]
SPECIAL ASSISTANT FOR RESEARCH & ENGINEERING, OASD

SUBJECT:  Unidentified Flying Object Sighting

1.  This memorandum is in answer to your unidentified flying object sighting of 7 October 1958 at Alexandria, Virginia. The sighting was referred immediately to the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for analysis and/or evaluation.

2.  In the opinion of the Air Technical Intelligence Center personnel, the phenomenon you saw was created by the reflection of on the sun from either ice crystals or a very thin cloud layer. As the sun lowered behind the horizon it illuminated less and less of the reflector, the decrease in size creating the illusion of motion. The wind had a component which was generally toward the motion, therefore, the reflector drifting toward the witness could help account for the apparent increase in altitude.

3.  The fact that the object was reported as first stationary and then moving lends to the above conclusion. There would be no apparent motion until the amount of reflected light began to noticeably diminish. Further weight is lent to this conclusion by the fact that this object was reported as being approximately 600' in length and investigation failed to uncover another witness.

Analysis and Conclusions:

IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TOWLINE REFLECTOR OF THE SETTING SUN AT A LAYER OF ICE CRYSTALS OR A LOW THIN CLOUD, AS THE SUN LOWERED TOWARD THE HORIZON IT ILLUMINATED LESS AND ITS OF THE REFLECTOR CAUSING THE ILLUSION OF MOTION. AS THE OBJECT APPARENTLY DECREASED IN SIZE. THE WIND HELD A COMPONENT WHICH WAS GENERALLY TOWARD THE NORTH THEREFORE THE REFLECTOR DRIFTING TOWARD THE WITNESS COULD HELP ACCOUNT FOR THE APPARENT INCREASE IN ALTITUDE.

THE REPORT THAT THE OBJECT WAS AT FIRST STATIONARY SEEMS TO LEND CONCLUSIVE THERE WOULD BE NO APPARENT MOTION UNTIL THE AMOUNT OF REFLECTED LIGHT BEGAN TO DIMINISH. THE FACT THAT MR TOWNSEND WAS ONLY WITH AS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY TIDE.

18. Neighborhood from which sighting was made: No witnesses could be found to corroborate sighting.

VI. CONCLUSION: Every effort was made to confirm the subject sighting by a second or third person, however, no corroborative evidence was uncovered. The only possibility that might explain the sighting is contained in Item V 15(1), the Capitol Airlines pilot's report of an unidentified aircraft with his nose light on flying North at the altitude of the source's sighting and in the vicinity of the sighting.

MEMORANDUM FOR M[REDACTED], OPP

SUBJECT: Sighting of an Unidentified Object - 7 October 1958

Between 6 and 6:10 PM on 7 Oct 1958, I was walking South on the 600 block of Lee Street, Alexandria, Virginia. I observed a bright delivery object in the sky due South at an elevation of 20° from the horizon. At first the object was stationary and then it rapidly gained altitude, proceeding South and away from me when it disappeared, becoming too small to see at an angle with the horizon of 30° to 35°. The sky was clear, there was no appreciable wind, and the visibility was unlimited. The disappearance of the object was due to its rapid procession to the distance. The total time it was in view was approximately 50 seconds - this permitted me to walk one-half block. Its estimated slant range would be approximately 3 miles, since, while it was in sight, a commercial plane from the National Airport taking off South turned West and was between me and the object. These planes usually turn West about 1 to 2 miles South of Alexandria. The object when first seen subtended an angle of approximately 3°. This would make it a very large object of the order of 600 feet. There was no sound of motor, jet or propellor. The shape was roughly spherical with an equator or skirt as shown in the attached sketch.

No one else was around at the time. The following morning I estimated the angles with a protractor and timed the distance of walking when the object was in sight.
