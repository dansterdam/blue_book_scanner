1. Reference your TWX AFOIN-L-J, 10-25L-6, Major Ralph N 
Albright, Det 10, 1006th AISS re-interviewed Mr. 
Due to his absence it was not possible to interview him until 14 
November 1958. Upon completion of the interview it was discussed
with personnel from Headquarters, 1006th ATSS and decided that it
did not warrant preparation of an IR. The information received is 
as follows:

  a. Appearance when first sighted was gossamer.

  b. The object was stationary for approximately 10 seconds.

  c. The distance was estimated in relation to terrain and 
  an aircraft departing Washington National Airport passed behind the 
  object.

  d. During recession object faded.

  e. There was a fading of brightness.

  f. After being stationary for 10 seconds object moved 
  until in 10 seconds it was too small to be resolved by the eye.

  g. Source had no idea of distance at which it dissappeared.

UFO OBSERVERS INSTRUCTION SHEET
(Sky Diagram)

1. GENERAL:

   a. The diagram represents all of the sky normally visible to the observer, who is pictured standing under the center of the "dome" of the sky. It is designed to show a three-dimensional view of the area centered around the observer at the time of the UFO sighting.

   b. The position of any object in the sky can be described by giving its elevation, or angle upward from the horizon, and its bearing or angle along the horizon, eastward from north.
   
   (1) Illustrations:

      (a) Elevation is 0 degrees for an object on the horizon, and 90 degrees for the point directly over the observer (zenith). Thus, an object half-way up from the horizon to the zenith has an elevation of 45 degrees.

      (b) Bearing (or "azimuth") is the angle along the horizon, starting from north and moving clockwise eastward. Thus, an object directly toward the east, no matter what its elevation is above the horizon, has a bearing of 90 degrees, an object in the south has a bearing of 180 degrees, toward the west, 270 degrees and so on. North is, of course, zero.

      EXAMPLE: An object is seen in the northeast and one-third way up from horizon to overhead. Thus, the object has a bearing of 45 degrees, and elevation of 30 degrees. Similarly, an object having a bearing of 180 degrees and an elevation of 60 degrees would be seen directly south and two-thirds of the way up from the horizon.

2. PLOTTING THE COURSE OF AN OBJECT ON THE SKY DIAGRAM:

   a. The path of an object across the sky can be shown completely on this diagram simply by connecting with a curved or straight line the various positions the object successively occupies (see example sheet). To aid visualization, the path on the western side of the sky is represented by broken lines; the eastern side in solid lines. Direction of the object is indicated by arrows. The duration of the sighting can be shown by indicating the time at the position, where the object was first and last observed. Where possible, the time at various intermediate positions occupied by the object should also be shown.

   b. The diagram can be made a more effective investigative and analytical tool by making the lines (showing the path of the object) thicker or thinner to indicate the varying brightness of the object observed. This is especially valuable when any object appeared only as a moving light at night. Thus, if a light becomes brighter and then gradually fades, it can be represented by a line becoming increasingly thicker and then gradually thinning out to nothing.

   c. Use of colored pencils is especially recommended if the object changes color or hue during the sighting.

The image does not contain a photograph but instead features a diagram of a sphere labeled as such with various points and angles including azimuths and elevations. There are directional markers (e.g., South, North, East, West), degrees, and lines delineating these angles. At the bottom of the sphere is a horizon line dotted with trees, and some buildings, possibly indicating a landscape view from a specific angle. There are texts and labels such as "Zenith," elevation angles like "30¬∞" and "60¬∞", and directional angles labeled around the sphere.

On 7 October 1958, Mr. of the Office of Special Assistant to The Secretary of Defense for Research and Development, Alexandria, Virginia, reported seeing an Unidentified Flying Object at 1010, daylight time. The object was observed for approximately 50 seconds and described as being bright, an oblate spheroid with an annulus around the circumference and approximately 600' in its longest dimension (subtended an angle of 3 degrees at 3 miles). The object was stationary for approximately 10 seconds and then disappeared by moving away from the witness. Mr. was the only witness to report this phenomena.

2. The opinion of the ATIC is that Mr. was a victim of an illusion created by the reflection of the sun from either ice crystals or a very thin cloud. As the sun lowered behind the horizon it illuminated less and less of the reflector, the decrease in size creating the illusion of motion. The wind had a component which was generally toward the north; therefore, the reflector drifting toward the witness could help account for the apparent increase in altitude. (This is a not, however, considered a major factor.

3. The fact that the object was reported as first stationary then moving lends to the above conclusion. There would be no apparent motion until the amount of reflected light began to noticeably diminish. Further weight is lent to this conclusion by the fact that this object was reported as being approximately 600' in length. Investigation failed to uncover another witness.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. ____________
SPECIAL ASSISTANT FOR RESEARCH & ENGINEERING, OASD

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting

1. This memorandum is in answer to your unidentified flying
object sighting of 7 October 1958 at Alexandria, Virginia. The
sighting was referred immediately to the Air Technical Intelligence
Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for analysis and/
or evaluation.

2. In the opinion of the Air Technical Intelligence Center
personnel, the phenomenon you saw was created by the reflection of
the sun from either ice crystals or a very thin cloud layer. As
the sun lowered behind the horizon it illuminated less and less of
the reflector, the decrease in size creating the illusion of
motion. The wind had a component which was generally toward the
north; therefore, the reflector drifting toward the witness could
help account for the apparent increase in altitude.

3. The fact that the object was reported as first stationary
then moving lends to the above conclusion. There would be no
apparent motion until the amount of reflected light began to
noticeably diminish. Further weight is lent to this conclusion
by the fact that this object was reported as being approximately
600' in length and investigation failed to uncover another witness.
