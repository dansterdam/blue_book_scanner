Dear Sirs,

Having had a conversation with a man of the local Intelligence Agency (CIA) by phone, he cautioned me to write you a letter concerning a U.F.O. which I observed in 1959 sometime shortly before or until May of 1959.

I had not written because of the untoward nature of such a report, afraid to the face of my status as a Navy Veteran. I was, though, more provoked to inform the Government of this "Flying Saucer", when I saw, three nights ago, a documentary of the truth concerning UFO's on T.V.

Enclosed are some films which contain pictures which I took of the object immediately upon the sighting. I took other pictures, but they, as you will see, may be on the same roll. The film strip (roll) was loaned only which I took in critica to the enclosed paper width the other, B.C. designates the order in which I believe them to be the pictures which were of the UFO which I observed.

The other observers are unknown to me besides [blacked out] (my Secretary at the time) and possibly her sister and her sister, California, the site of the UFO.

My secretary visited frequently this area for health reasons, and largely here because of her sister's residence. (i.e. at her own home there.)

I was standing by my car in front of the house, Lucille was just coming out of the house and was half way between the house and the auto when I heard a clicking sound in the air as if of the navy-type camera with the hand-winder. The clicking of photos, or ?, were spaced at even intervals of about 3 seconds.

I heard then, and possibly [blacked out] inside of the house. I immediately looked up and saw an object of the following nature:

The UFO hovered at the hill above near the "Italians" house and paused (hovered) for about 2 minutes then proceeded in a curve.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

-2-

Approximately consistent with the direction from which it came.
This direction from which the object came was about 30, by 8 or
more to the East than 12 by 5. The speed was enormous, but seemed
to climb about 10° above the horizon gradually to some 30°.

Mrs. [REDACTED] home is situated just below the highway near the
Northern and smaller hills of Elsinore, of the mountains and hills
which surround Elsinore in a fairly fine circle.

The object is not to be described as a flying wing, helicopter,
or any other known aircraft which I have seen, and I have seen many,
and have been in the Navy for three years aboard an aircraft carrier,
and having spent 1 year at Randolph AFB as an Aeronautical Engineer trained in the Navy Reserve to observe aircraft by instantaneous
film closure. This object could not move a sea, although, as a hallucination. I was 20-20 vision, and am not subject to mental hallucinations as a matter of fact to the Bay sighting, I was on health foods for
4 years, having attended health lectures of many different authorities. I am, further, of an I.Q. of 141 and my grand-father was the "Strongest Man Who Ever Lived". [REDACTED] son of the
famous Huntington, has been a blood analysis and has seen that
I retain the evidence of this in my blood.

References may be obtained to establish my present status.
I was a Navy boxer in top physical condition, and take stretching
exercises at this time, next to my health practices. I have been
a top salesman in Los Angeles and previously for a long time.

Do not be moved by my V.A. record, because all that occurred
to me was a historical shell. I was a security-check person
in the Navy. I retain my proud American, Democratic principles.
But above all, I have been a religious-worker haphazardly for
about 15 years (that is, on a religious basis). I was licensed
to preach for two years in the World Fellowship of the World
Church with Hq here in L.A. I am a member of the society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, being considered somewhat of an authority
in the Rabbinical Cabala.

The UFO was not spinning, and moved so smoothly, there was
no sound but the clicking, which stopped as the vehicle receded.

I have enclosed two undeveloped film which may have been
kept (what is, one of them) from the time of the sighting. I trust,
you may be able to send me a series of negative or film under-exposed
film, or some simple strip developments.

I have written in the interest of documentation, only as it
may help to reach a more thorough identification of U.F.O. for
the benefit of the military establishment.

Sincerely yours,
[SIGNATURE REDACTED]
