The text in the "BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING" field describes an observation of a bright light hovering near the ground that then climbed rapidly, leaving a trail of light before disappearing.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a typed document or report. I will proceed to transcribe the text from the document as an OCR system:

Having had a conversation with a man of the legal intelligence (OLA) who had a sighting of the three objects(large luminous objects) just after 5:25 P. M., March 12, 1959, near Hidden Valley.

I had not written because of the nature of such a report and due to the many recent personal problems and family illness, etc. which I have had to deal with and which have occupied me greatly. 

A documentary of the truth concerning UFO's on T.V. took 3/4 of an hour which contained measures which I could not consider as coming to the point and which I cannot relate to. 

The film strip (roll) developed only which is carried to the letter.  The other observers are unknown to me besides those of Elsinore, California, the site of the UFO.

My secretary visited frequently this area for health reasons, and how unfortunate it was that I was not present. It was standing by my car in front of the house. Lucille was just coming out of the house and was half way between the house and the car. She observed the navy-type craft with the hand-twirling. The clicking of about 2 seconds.

I imagine I heard that and possibly that was my car. I cannot say for certain, if this was the following in the first place.

The UFO hovered on the hill above near the "Stallions' house" and moved (toward) for about 2 minutes then proceeded in a downward direction.

There is no photograph present in this page of the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The image appears to be a typed report containing text only.

Approximately constant with the direction from which it came. This direction was from a particularly direction, while the object itself was from a general area to the northwest, appearing to be about 10' above the horizon gradually to some 30Â°.

The object is to be described as a flying wing, elliptical, or any other term used when describing aircraft which have seen and heard, such as many people claimed to have seen. The object was in view for about 2 seconds. It was observed to be silent except for a very slight whining noise, comparatively high pitched, which did not resemble the sound of a jet, but was more like the whining noise to be said, I believe, often associated with some type of auxiliary power plant on a jet aircraft. The speed was estimated to be in excess of 700 mph.

There is an observation that there was no trail or exhaust of any kind visible. At no time did the object change course, speed or altitude. It was sighted during daylight hours, and the sky conditions were clear.

I was, in fact, a practicing attorney of some years, and I believe the information outlined above was as accurate as I could make it. I hope the foregoing is of assistance to you.

DO NOT be moved by any Y.A.F. record, because all that occurred is simply a rough idea in the Navy. I readily and firmly believe that people do not want to discuss this and openly support the fact that they are extremely reliable and consistent for a National Defense Program, and believe them, from the bottom of my heart, that the service men concerned have seen what they have reported and believe in L.A.F. if, as it seems to be, the object of an extensive official inquiry.

23 March 1960

Dear Mr. 

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter
of 17 January 1960 concerning an unidentified flying object
sighting and your interest in this field.

The file was carefully checked by the photographic
branch of the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center at
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, and the UFO was not considered
visually identified through this analysis.

This sighting did not have sufficient information to
allow a valid conclusion.

Thanks for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,
