The text from the document is as follows:

```
At 10-20 P. M. on July 16th, a Superior, Nebraska resident named Jim Chapman claimed that, while he was on his way home from a ball game, a UFO followed him along a highway. When he changed his direction of travel, the UFO did also. Finally Chapman became "plain scared," and headed back to where he could find someone for moral support. Chapman eventually came upon two other people, and the three of them reported that the UFO followed them in the same way, changing direction whatever they did. It was at a 30-degree angle in the sky and about a quarter of a mile away, according to the witnesses...

The SUPERIOR (Nebraska) EXPRESS July 16, 1959 carried the folowing accout of an equally strange scene:

"Anyone Else See the Flying Saucer or Whatever It Was? Three Saw It.
They didn't get a cloceup view of it and they do not claim to have seen a flying saucer. there must be some logical explanation of it they agree, but they haven't figured out what it is. There certainly was something flying around Nuckolls County one night recently at least three people think so. 

First to see the strange object was Jim Chapman of Nelson. Jim had been at a ball game and saw it first at about 10 p.m. on his way home. Just before turning west a the corner three miles southwest of Oak it was ahead of him then, he said, and when he turned west it turned too, then went in front of him and again followed him west along the road.

He continued that he was "plain scared‚Äù and said that after it had been following him for a while he turned and head back toward Nelson. Here the object was to his right and back a short distance, he said. Two women from Nelson whom Jim did not know headed for Nelson. The three of them traveled together and the UFO followed them, seemingly to one side and rear again and finally flew off in another direction and faded from view.

The object was brilliant appeared to be round and several in diameter, and was at about a 30-degree angle in the sky and about a quartero of a mile distant. Anyone else see it? You note

An attempt was made by the writer to contact Chapman relative to his experience but he would not correspond. Since he did not have a phone the effort was not meet with success. However, the Kneeskers were reached by phone and Mrs. Kneeskers confirmed their signing. She was unable to add any additional details. The printed newspaper version of their experience related above, but did remark that they felt the strange light must have been a reflection but didn' know what from and were badly frightened by the weirdness of the experience.

Location___North Pacific (Hawaii)_________________________________
Date__11 July 1959_________Hour (Z)___1302Z___________
WX___Clear___________________________________________
Description___A bright, white light moving constantly at a high rate of speed. Appeared to be a very bright center light with four smaller lights.
Observation lasted approximately 10 seconds. Object appeared SW and disappeared south.__

Direction of Motion ___South__________________
Satellite (AFCIN-4E3, Phone 69219)_________________________
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc)________________

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1)___________________________________

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc)_________________________

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.______________________________

__The 11 July Pacific ocean sighting resulted from a meteor.
All aircraft saw the meteor at the same time and the direction was also constant.__

Evaluation of Source Reliability____________________________

Analysis and Conclusions: Even though the aircraft involved in this sighting were spread out over an area of approximately 800 miles, all indicated that the object was in the same general direction from their individual positions. This point substantiates the fact that the object was at a very great distance from the witnesses. The description of this object is that characteristic of meteors of the fireball class. These meteors may have a magnitude of greater than -4 (brighter than Venus), while meteors of this type are not an every day occurrence, the experience of seeing one is not at all uncommon. However, one's first experience with meteors of this type is bound to be startling and lasting.

July 29, 1959

Department of Defense
Washington
D. C.

Gentlemen:

I am inquiring about an object that my husband, and several other people in this part of the country, saw which is on the order of a "Flying Saucer." The way my husband described it, he saw an object which was really just a white light which tinged red,
and it was about 3 miles high & 5 miles in distance from him. He saw this about 7 weeks ago, and just 2 days ago, a family here in Nelson, Nebraska saw it outside their home. It has no definite form, and makes no noise, but is merely a light and follows people.

It has frightened my husband so that he will not go out at night. I wonder if you could give us any information that would lead to a probable explanation. Anything that could put my husband's mind at ease.

I know this is a bother, and if there is any charge, please send me a bill. Our town, Nelson is in the South-central part of Nebraska.

Thanking you for your time and trouble, I remain

[REDACTED]
Nelson, Nebraska

P.S. There is a stamped addressed envelope enclosed for your convenience.
