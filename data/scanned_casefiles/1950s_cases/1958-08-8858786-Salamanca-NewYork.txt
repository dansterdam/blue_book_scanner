looked as though they were subjected
to heat. Additional witnesses insist
that they feel a tingle when they
touch the objects.

objs to be Radar chaff similar
to 2S Al as specific under
AMS 4001-b sheet stock.

SUBJECT:                                                      Salamanca, N.Y.
                                                                        August 3, 1958

Dear Sir:

Yesterday at approximately 600p, I noticed thousands of silver colored objects at various sites falling around my town. I could see these objects, although I did not see nor hear any plane. I could see these objects glittering in the shelllight for several hundred feet in the air.

Upon searching I found several pieces of which I am enclosing this sample of metal, which looks as if it were through an explosion or came here.

Of course this has evoked much and conjecture, everything from a jet bomber explosion to a falling sputnik, and several of the men insist they feel a single in their hand where they touched this.

For what it may be worth for evaluation and testing, this is just on small piece, there must be thousands more around if you are interested.

Yours very truly,
[Signature blacked out]
Bradford, Pa.

TO: Maj Tecker
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: ATIC-3

REMARKS:
1. UFO from general public.

2. The description of the object is definitely characteristic of radar chaff. He has practice exercises quite often and several times the public has seen in samples as UFOs.

3. The analysis is attached for your information only.

1. The metal sample furnished, along with the above report, has been analyzed spectographically and shows the following composition:

Al f    Si     Cu     Fe     Mn     Mg     Ti
.1      .1     .05    .2     .1     .01    .01

2. This composition corresponds very closely to 28 Al as specified under AMS 4001-B for sheet stock. Because of the ductility exhibited by the specimen (bending back and forth with fingers is possible), it is concluded that the sample is sheet stock and not cast; hence, photomicrographs were not made. The sample in question could well be radar foil which has been burned.

Dear [redacted]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 August 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object which fell from the sky on 2 August at Salamanca, New York.

A spectographic analysis of the material furnished with your letter shows the object to be radar chaff.

Sincerely,
