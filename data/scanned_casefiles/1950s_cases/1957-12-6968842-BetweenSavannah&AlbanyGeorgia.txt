STATEMENT OF T/SGT CLIFFORD A. JOHNSON, GCA OPERATOR, 1920TH AACS
Approximately 0725 I was called from my position at the precision radar/GCA Station (APAC) to the direction of the east end of the runway, where there was a lighted object apparently hovering over the field. I went to the place indicated on his surveillance scope. It was a good strong large luminous white object near the city of Cairo, Florida.

The target remained stationary for about two miles southwest of the airbase. The object then made a sudden dash to the east at a high rate of speed, covering a distance of approximately 5 miles. It was then motionless in the sky for about 100 yards. The target then made a sudden dash to the west at a high rate of speed, covering a distance of approximately 5 miles. It was then motionless in the sky for about 100 yards. The target then made another dash to the east at a high rate of speed, covering a distance of approximately 4 miles. At this time the target gave a good clear return. There was no feeling of speed as approximately 4 miles covered in about 12 seconds. The target return was very weak and faded about 7 or 8 miles east of the original position. The target continued to the east and was lost on the scope.

The above statement is, to the best of my knowledge, true.
