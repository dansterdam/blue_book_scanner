Flying Time. Captain Hardy is a senior pilot with 15 years service and 3000 hours flying time. Both officers are completely reliable observers.

Both made statements to the effect that they had been exceptional of all unidentified flying object incidents up to the present time. They were both convinced that the light was an airborne object not with apparent explanation through natural phenomena, or known aircraft familiar to them.

Enclosure #1 is included in this report show it ties in so closely with the visual sighting.

(12) None.

INCLOSURE #1

STATEMENT OF T/SGT CLIFFORD A. JOHNSON, GCA OPERATOR, 1926TH AACS

It approximately 0702327 I was called from my position at the precision radar section (PFM/16) at 12th RAPCON to the pickup position position (GN/8) by A/2c John Deadman. He directed my attention to a stationary target presented on his surveillance scope. It was a good strong target positioned at Cordele, Georgia near the city of Cordele, Florida. The target remained stationary for about three sweeps of the antenna and then disappeared. It reappeared within one sweep at a new position. The B/66 aircraft, originally posting, the CP/18 continued to show the target in different positions in an area of about four square miles in the vicinity of Cordele for a period of four to five minutes. During this time the target gave a good clear return. There was no riding. At approximately C702LCZ the target took a southerly heading, speed about 100 knots for approximately four miles. The target return grew progressively weaker and faded about a mile northwest Nubird Field. Fine of last paint was approximately C702LCZ.

Only one known aircraft (B-66) was in the area and was identifiable at all times.

The above statement was made to the undersigned on 9 December 1957.
