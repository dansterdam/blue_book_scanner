REPORT OF THE SIGHTING WAS MADE BY OBSERVERS TO THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, GREAT FALLS AIR BASE, MONTANA.

ON 22 FEBRUARY 1953, at about 2130 MST on the night of 22 February 1953, a man and his companion were driving in a small town of Dodson, Montana, approximately 198 miles north-northeast of Great Falls when they observed a brilliant white light in the sky at an estimated elevation of 20 to 400 feet and a distance of approximately 5 to 7 miles west of Dodson. The light was described as being approximately 200-300 yards in diameter, shaped similar to a flattened sphere, and hovering at a speed which they stated was too slow for an aircraft. The light was observed for approximately 5 minutes, then it disappeared in a northerly direction at a speed approximately 1000 miles per hour.

MR. and MRS. ______ who reside at _______, Great Falls, Montana, were identified as the observers and all witnesses agreed as to what they observed, which was in substance as follows:

Major J. M. Penny, USAF
Received from CO 1701st AW, Great Falls AFB, Montana (Rec. and Date Time Group Unknown)
Submitted in accordance with AFR No. 200-5, dated 20 April 1952, Subj: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOBS).
At approximately 2130 MST on 22 February 1953 an Unidentified Flying Object was observed northwest of Dodson, Montana (approximate coordinates 48°20'N - 108°30'W).
When first observed the object appeared as a motionless brilliant white light at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. It was estimated to be 2 to 7 miles away from the observers. The light then began a rapid, silent movement, turning in various directions and flashing on and off at intervals of several seconds. At one point the light was very bright and seemed to be gaining altitude. After remaining in the air for approximately 5 minutes, the white light changed to a red glow. No sound from the object was heard. Total time of observation about 7 minutes.
Weather conditions at the time of sighting was not given nor was any information as to known air-borne aircraft furnished.

"The story I related to my husband and friends, but without them showing any enthusiasm. I let the matter drop, and it was not until the summer of Captain Biscainell's experience over it in July, 1951, and seeing the story in a magazine illustration of what I had seen and drawn previously for my husband and several friends."

(Here follows a sketch of Captain Biscainell's sighting of an object on February 19, 1951. The sighting was only perceptible; it did not possess any more than one dark, flickering hand about its middle. The pickwell object, nor did it possess any more than a dark, flickering hand about its middle.)

Unfortunately, there is no photograph present in this image. The text appears to be a report from Project Blue Book, describing a sighting of a flying saucer over Nairobi, Kenya.

SYDNEY N.S.W. FEBRUARY 23, 1953

The report of what is believed to be a large saucer over observed, reached the Australian Flying Saucer Bureau from Nairobi, East Africa. The witness, Mrs. [Redacted], Nairobi, wrote:

"I left Mombasa at the end of June 1947, on the S.S. Llangoyty Castle on route to Sydney, Town, and coming through the Straits of Mozambique about the beginning of July 1947, when my attention was drawn to an object which appeared to be a large saucer shaped like a plate, hovering above the surface of the water at a height which I estimate to be about 20 feet. The saucer was motionless, until it suddenly began to revolve at a great speed. It then disappeared from view as it moved too quickly, in a fast speed, for my eye to follow. It was a very bright object, which flashed like metal in the sun, and appeared to be made of a substance resembling stainless steel and seemed like a solid one-piece construction. It appeared suddenly, made one complete revolution and then disappeared."

FLYING SAUCERS:
About 20 feet above the sea, parallel with the Subsidiary Castle, and travelling in the same direction.
Gaining a little in speed, after a second or two, the whole shape disappeared without a sound, from the rear of the vessel it was making about 7 knots length of the object. It appeared that there must be something inside that was transmitting light, but still we could hear no noise from the flames. No windows could be seen, only a solid mass of metal which if it had been a complete circular ship, would have measured about 4 times the width of the ship, which was about 4 knots a high.
