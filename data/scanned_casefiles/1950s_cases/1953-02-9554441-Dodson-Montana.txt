1. Report of the sighting was made by observers to the 170lst Air Transport Wing, Great Falls Air Force Base, Montana on 24 February. The following day an investigation was conducted at the Tang Operation and Training Office at Dodson, Montana to interview witnesses. No written statements were taken from the witnesses who were Mr. & Mrs. [redacted] and their two sons [redacted] and [redacted]. Witnesses agreed as to what they observed which was in substance as follows:

2. At about 2130 MST on the night of 22 February 1953, Mr. [redacted] accompanied by a man named [redacted] and his wife were driving in a truck in the small town of Dodson, Montana, approximately 198 miles north northeast of Great Falls when they observed a brilliant white light in the sky at an estimated altitude of 25,000 feet and at a point some five to seven miles west of Dodson. As the light was too bright to be a star, they stopped to observe it more closely. At the time the light was first observed it was standing still, and remained motionless for about a minute, then apparently began moving in a northerly direction at a speed approximating an aircraft (no estimate of speed in MPH was given). The light continued to move in a northerly direction for a distance of approximately 5 miles (this distance being estimated from an equal distance of the width of the Milk River Valley) then came to a halt and again remained motionless for less for about 3 minutes. Abruptly the light began moving in a northwest direction at very high speed, as its speed increased, the color of the light changed from a piercing red glow.

3. [Redacted] and [redacted], son and stepson, respectively, of Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] mentioned above, about seventeen (17) years of age were at their home in Dodson and observed the same object at the same time in the same location as had their parents. Details given by these two boys coincided with the information given by their parents and Mr. [redacted].

4. Mr. [redacted], is 42 years of age, an ex-service man who served in the South Pacific during the war and served another military tour of duty as an MP in Europe. Mr. [redacted] stated further that several Indians on a neighboring reservation had spoken about similar sightings in that vicinity over the last several months.

Submitted in accordance with AF LTR. No. 200-5, dated 20 April 1952, Subj: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting.

At approximately 2130 MST on 22 February 1953 an Unidentified Flying Object was observed visually from the ground by five (5) civilians at a point 5 to 7 miles west of Dodson, Montana (approximate coordinates 48° 23' N - 156° 10' W).

When first observed the object appeared as a motionless brilliant white light at an estimated altitude from 3500 to 4000 feet, remaining stationary for about 4 minutes then began moving in a northerly direction at the approximate speed of an aircraft for a distance of some 5 miles and again remained motionless for 3 minutes. Then abruptly departed on a northwest heading at good increased speed. The white light changed to a red glow. No sound from the object was heard. Total time of observation about 3 minutes.

Weather conditions at time of sighting was not given nor was any information as to known air-borne aircraft furnished.

"The story I related to my husband and friends, but without them showing any enthusiasm, I let the matter drop, and to my surprise read later of Captain Bicknell's experience over Mt. Kilimanjaro in 1951, and saw the exact shape in an illustration of what I had seen and drawn previously for my husband and several friends.".

(Mrs. [redacted] sketch of the object enclosed with her report tallies in most major respects with a sketch of the object seen by Capt. Bicknell and others over Mt. Kilimanjaro in February 1951, the only provable difference being, th. t his, King's report, did not possess a rear fin as did the Bicknell object; nor did it possess any more than one dark, encircling band about its middle. The Bicknell object had several bands encircling its middle.) Ed.

SYDNEY, N.S.W. FEBRUARY 23, 1953.

The report of what is believed to be the largest saucer ever observed, reached the Australian Flying Saucer Bureau from Nairobi, East Africa.

Eye witness, Mrs. [redacted], Nairobi, wrote:-

"I left Mombasa at the end of June 1947, on the S.S. Llandovery Castle en route to Cape Town, and going through the Straits of Madagascar about the beginning of July was on deck with another lady and one other officer. It was 1 p.m., when we noticed a particularly bright star. It was travelling very fast and approached into the ship. Suddenly a searchlight appeared, which flashed a strong beam of light on the water at an 80 yards of the ship, it descended, its beam shortening, and becoming brighter as it neared the water, and the next instant there was no more light, but an object appeared apparently made of steel and shaped like a cigar cut at the rear end. It remained in the air about 20 feet above the sea, parallel with the Llandovery Castle, and travelling in the same direction.

"Gaining a little in speed, after a second or two the whole shape disappeared without a sound, from the rear issuing fierce flames which shot out to about 1/2 the length of the object. It appeared that there must be something like an huge furnace inside the thing, but still we could hear no noise from the flames. No windows could be seen, only a band of metal round the entire thing, which, if it had been a complete cigar-shape, would have been certainly situated.

"The object was very large, about 4 times the length of the Llandovery Castle, and at a rough guess about 4 times as high.

"We had a wonderful view, but in a few seconds it disappeared. No light was seen forward as it left, it just vanished. Somehow or other the ship's officers with a few passengers, the entire party of whom had seen the same thing, whether it is recorded in the ship's log, I know not.
