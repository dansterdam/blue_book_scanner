SUMMARY:

On 11 March 1958, at 0900 Zebra, Pan American Airlines-Flight 509, made a radar contact at a position approximately 1200 N 0803O. W. Captain _____ , aircraft commander, reported that the return was first noticed at a range of 125 miles directly on track. Size was about three times the return produced by a fighter and closing in shape. The rate of closure was very fast for about 50 miles. When the range was 75 miles, the rate of closure became normal. At fifty miles range, the return was exactly the same as a strong cumulus cloud and had a definite cell. At twenty mile range, the return dissipated, and although the visibility was excellent, nothing was sighted. The aircraft was a DC3B with RCA radar. Flight altitude was 17,500 feet.

1. Data is too limited to make an analysis. It appears, however, that
anomalous propagation is a strong possibility since the observer indicated that
return was exactly the same as a strong cumulous cloud (return) at one point. The
face that the target ("three times the size of a freighter") was not visible at
20 miles with excellent visibility conditions seems to preclude the target as
material.

1. The first of these reported sightings seems to indicate the possibility of one or more balloons since the targets were more or less stationary except for altitude changes. The radar could have broken lock on a balloon at relatively low altitude and then looked on another at higher altitude which would have given the impression that a rapid ascent of the target had occurred. Efforts to sight the target visually failed which would indicate either a small target such as a balloon or possibly a false target. The false target explanation is considered a very small possibility since a second radar reportedly locked on the same target.

2. The second of these reported sightings seems to indicate a false target because of the erratic nature of the signal return and efforts to sight the target visually failed during daylight hours. False radar targets occur occasionally, due mainly to atmospheric and weather phenomena, but sometimes due to spurious signals from various sources of interference.

During the period 9 through 13 March, three unexplainable radar contacts have been made by equipment located in the Canal Zone. On two occasions, aircraft were vectored into the area by the radar sites. While interrogation of scope operators has indicated that returns were strong and easily distinguishable from cloud formations. Returns were definitely when associated with clouds. Generally the tracks were triangular with speed of movement very erratic. Movement was at times to be evasive action. The incident of 9 - 10 March was tracked by gun laying radar. During period of 9 March, radar maintenance personnel checked out their system thoroughly. In addition, lock was broken, however, the equipment immediately picked up target and located on a second tracking radar sited on Taboga Island, locked on the return. Target generally remained in same area half way between radar sites. Personnel stationed at sites reported seeing red and green lights but no noise was associated with lights. Visibility was good. However, lights were visible for only a short period. A commercial flight volunteered to investigate target.

At 10:12R on 10 March, search radar reported unidentified target west of canal. A T-33 from Howard Field was sent to investigate. Negative results. Aircraft was in the immediate area of target with negative sighting. Contact was broken at 13:15R.

In accordance with Department of the Army Intelligence Collection Memorandum 200-762, dated 6 August 1957, subject: "Unconventional Aircraft", the following information is submitted:

1. On 10 March 1958, Capt. Harold E. Stahlman, Operations Officer, 706th Anti-Aircraft Operations Center (AAOC) Fort Clayton, Canal Zone, reported information concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object. At 2003R, 9 March 1958, Stahlman, as a his base by Command for Anti-Aircraft Defense, was notified that the Operations Duty Officer, AAOC, that the AAOC had received a radar report of an unidentified aircraft approaching the Pacific side of the Isthmus of Panama. Stahlman arrived at the AAOC at approximately 2008R.

During the radar tracking of the first blip which appeared on the radar screen, two additional blips were observed at 2045R. The first echo was identified as a Chilean Airlines aircraft which landed at Tocumen Airport, Tocumen, Republic of Panama. The two objects were in the vicinity of Fort Kobbe, Canal Zone. A two-man civilian search or the area with negative results. The original blips were picked up by Search Radar and then transferred to the Track Radar Unit located at Flamenco Island, Fort Amador, Canal Zone. This information was obtained:

Number of Objects: Two, approximately one hundred yards apart.

Duration of Radar Observation: 2003R, 9 March 1958, to 0203R, 10 March 1958.

Location of Radar: Battery D, 764th AAA Bn, Flamenco Island

Location of Object: LJ 2863 (Geo-Ref. Military Grid Reference System)

Prevailing Weather: Clear, visibility unlimited, no wind reported.

Direction of Flight: Average angle of elevation, 365°, Azimuth, 330 mils.

Manner of Flight: Steady, slight circular path over the vicinity of Fort Kobbe, Canal Zone.

Altitude: Varied from two to ten thousand feet. Average of seven thousand feet.

An attempt was made by members of the Radar site, Flamenco Island, to obtain visual confirmation of the objects by searchlight. Then the light was trained on the objects and they appeared to move several feet in five to ten seconds.

This was such a rapid movement, that the Track Radar, which was locked on target, broke the Track Lock and was unable to keep up with the ascent of the object. As Track Radar can only be locked on a solid object, which was done in the case of the two unidentified flying objects, it was assumed that the objects were solid.

The possibility that the sightings might have been weather balloons was discarded when the Air Force was convinced and stated that no balloons were in the air at that time. (P-3)

2. On 10 March 1958, Capt. Stahlman made another report concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object by Search Radar located on Taboga Island, Republic of Panama. The following information was obtained in regard to the sightings:

Number of Objects: One.
Duration of Radar Observation: 1012R to 1412R, 10 March 1958.
Location of Radar: Taboga Island Radar Site.
Location of Object: KL 1646. (Geo-Ref, Military Grid Reference System)
Prevailing Weather: Partly cloudy.
Manner of Flight: From an erratic to a triangular shaped flight pattern.
Altitude: Undeterminable due to radar system used.
Speed: Variable, from hovering to approximately one thousand miles per hour.

Track Radar indicated that the object moved away from two United States Air Force jet aircraft that were approaching. At the same time speed of the object was calculated approximately one thousand miles per hour. The use of Track Radar was terminated at 1412R.

On 11 March 1958, Lt. Roy M. Strom, Operations Officer, 734th AAA Bn, Fort Clayton, Canal Zone, reported information received from a Pan-American Airways Pilot concerning an unidentified object. At approximately 0400R, 11 March 1958, the pilot of incoming aircraft C-509, a Pan American Airlines DC-6, observed an unidentified flying object 12 degrees North on Port Prot route, which object appeared larger than the aircraft and was traveling in a southwesterly direction.

At the same time Lt. Strom reported that an unidentified flying object was picked up by Hawk Radar. The object was plotted twice at approximately 0508R heading Northwest at LK 383. On the third plot, at 0517R, the object had moved to LK 5034 in a Southwesterly direction. Eleven minutes elapsed during the confirmation of the three plots. At 0508R, the object was sighted at LK 4303. Incoming aircraft C-509 was in the same area and Hawk Radar was asked if it was the same track. The answer was negative. The object was last plotted at LK 3254 at 0358R, still traveling in a Southwestern direction. Radar contact was lost at that time. The size, shape, or altitude of the object could not be determined by radar. (P-6)

G2 USARCARIB COMMENT: DATCM #200-722-1 mentioned above requires that:

"The Headquarters of the nearest Major Air Command should be notified of sightings which come to the attention of Army Personnel," referenced DATCM (Air Force Commands have instructions from the Department of the Air Force which cover reporting on subject: (ATR-200-2; "Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting, Short Title: UFOIB) (U)". This office continues to report information as developed.
