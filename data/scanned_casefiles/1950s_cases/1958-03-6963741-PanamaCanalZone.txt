Unidentified flying object
ON 11 March 1958, at 0900 Zebra, Pan American Airlines flight 506, made a radar contact at a position approximately 1200 miles E. of COLON, Panama. This contact was made on the return portion of the flight after crew sighted a bright light and objects in shape, which continued for three times the return produced by a regular aircraft and 'disappeared in space'. The return was exactly the same as a strong Stratus cloud and had a definite leading and trailing edge. Flight time of contact was 45 seconds. The radar contact did compare with RCA radar. Flight attitude was 17,500 feet.

1. Data is too limited to make an analysis. It appears, however, that anomalous propagation is a strong possibility since the observer indicated that return was exactly the same as a strong (familiar) aircraft at one point. The fact that the largest ("three times the size of a military aircraft") was not visible at 20 miles with excellent visibility conditions seems to preclude the target as material.

FROM: ATCH-4-21 
DATE: 30 Oct 58 COMMENT NR. 2

1. The first of these reported sightings seems to indicate the possibility of one or more balloons since the targets were more or less stationary except for a slight side to side motion. The radar guide could have picked up an object at slightly low altitude and then locked on another at a higher altitude which would have given the impression that a rapid ascent had occurred. Efforts to sight the target visually failed which would indicate either a small target such as a balloon or possibly a false target as discussed. The target was tracked on the SCR-584 radar which is considered to be accurate.

2. The second of these reported sightings seems to indicate a false target because of the erratic nature of the signal return and efforts to sight the target. False radar returns sometimes occur occasionally due mainly to atmospheric and weather phenomena, but sometimes due to spurious signals from various known sources of interference.

UNCLASSIFIED
SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
PANAMA CANAL ZONE
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF INTELLIGENCE
DURING the period 9 through 13 March, three unexplainable radar sightings were made in the Canal Zone area. According to a top secret report, "During this period, three radar scopes showed unexplained objects at various times. All radar returns were strong and easily discernible from normal aircraft returns." The returns were tracked and recorded by air traffic controllers, who stated that the objects were unidentifiable and bore no resemblance to any known aircraft.
Various sightings and reports of the objects were made by tower operators and pilots flying commercial flights over the area. A commercial flight voluntarily investigated two of the targets and confirmed their existence. No explanation for the targets has been determined.

AT 10:12R on 19 March, search radar reported unidentified aircraft entering the immediate area of BALBOA with its flight observed for several minutes. The aircraft was described as a twin or multi-engine type and exhibited high speed. The aircraft left the immediate area but was observed and tracked for some distance before it disappeared from radar scope.

This was such a rapid movement, that the crack radar, which was installed at Taboga Island was unable to track it with the aspect of the objects. The track radar can only indicate the presence of an object but cannot define its speed or altitude. The oscilloscope observed an estimated speed of 1600 to 2700 miles per hour. The possibility that the sightings might have been weather balloons was considered and ruled out for the following reasons:

1. On 10 March 1958, Capt. Hartlann made another report concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object by Search Radar located on Taboga Island, Republic of Panama. The following information was obtained in regard to this sighting:

Number of Objects: One.
Duration of Radar Observation: 11312 to 1412R, 18 March 1958.
Location of Radar: Taboga Island, Republic of Panama.
Location of Object: N. 1546, Ellison Field, near entrance system.
Prevailing Weather: Partly cloudy.
Manner of Flight: From an erratic to a triangular-shaped flight pattern.
Altitude: Undetermined due to radar system used.
Speed: Variable, from hovering to approximately one thousand miles per hour.

The track radar indicated that the object moved at a speed varying from two thousand to one thousand miles per hour. The use of Track Radar was terminated at 1412R on 18 March 1958.

At the same time Lt. Baron reported that an unidentified flying object was picked up on the radar scopes in that area on 6 March 1953. The object was tracked for approximately 40 minutes during the morning hours.

The object was reported to be at an altitude of 12,000 to 18,000 feet. Its speed was estimated to be in excess of 500 knots. The object could not be identified as any known conventional type aircraft. The radar scope display indicated the object to be a very definite target that was tracked in a continuous flight pattern. No explanation was offered for its identification.

USAFCARIB COMMENT: DATEM #400-732-1 mentioned above.

"The Headquarters of the nearest Major Air Command should be notified of significant sightings which could be of strategic interest. ATIC continues..." (air force commander have instructions on the reporting of this type sightings) continued: "This office continues to report information as developed."
