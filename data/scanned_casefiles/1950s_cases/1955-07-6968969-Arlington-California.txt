The night was dark, clear, dry and cool with a slight breeze blowing. There was dull moonlight and many stars were out. The single object was observed for four to five seconds and appeared brighter than the background. The object seemed close but the distance could not be judged by source.

A. The object did not appear to stand still nor suddenly speed up and rush away at any time. Source did not know if the object exploded but stated that it faded out fast. It did change brightness and gave off smoke or fumes in the form of a tail or trail but did not change shape nor flicker during sighting.

B. The object appeared to be solid and did not move in front of nor behind any object at any time. Source does not wear glasses and no visual aids were used for the sighting.

Object traveled in a downward arc from Northwest to Northeast. Are decreased from 60° to 15° elevation above the horizon.

D. Source stated that he had seen meteors before but never at such close range. He believed this object to be a meteor.

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

I saw a bright object orangish yellow in color coming from the West and travelling to the East. It traveled across the sky in a downward arc. I observed it for 1 to 5 seconds. I believed it to be a meteor, but reported it immediately as I had never seen one that close and was not sure that it was a meteor. The tail changed in color from orange to red and then to blue.
