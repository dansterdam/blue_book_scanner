PAGE 4 OF 9 PAGES

I. SOURCE:
Address: Arlington, California
Age: 25 years
Occupation: Student and Ground Observer
Education: Completed seven years of grade school.

II. DETAILS OF SIGHTING:
While at personal interview, source stated to be an amateur astronomer, and the imagination which he exhibited during the interview, places him as a fair source.

III. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
Sometime before 2000 hours on 4 April 1955, source was on duty at ground level outside the Arlington Ground Observation Post at the time of the sighting. The night was dark and cool with a slight breeze. The object was observed for four to five seconds and appeared brighter than the
background.

IV. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
The object did not appear to stand still nor suddenly speed up and rush away. It seemed to move in a straight line and disappear on the horizon. It did not change brightness and gave off no smoke or flames. In his estimation of the object's size, it varied between the size of a half-dollar to that somewhat larger than a dollar bill.

V. SOURCE'S EVALUATION:
The source was indefinite in his estimation of the object's size. It varied between the size of a half-dollar to that somewhat larger than a dollar bill. Object traveled in a straight line across the horizon.

D. Source stated that he had seen meteorites before but never at such close range. He believed this object to be a meteor.
