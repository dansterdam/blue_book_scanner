1. The Honorable [redacted], [redacted], Colorado State
Senate, in a letter written to the Denver Office, Federal Bureau of Investigations, dated 5 December 1955, stated that on or about 25 November 1955
he had seen an unidentified object in the vicinity of La Veta, Colorado.

2. The Denver Office, FBI, referred the matter to this office by letter,
dated 9 December 1955. Two attempts were made by this office to contact [redacted]
at his home in Walsenburg, Colorado.

3. On 12 January 1956, Special Agent JAMES A. ROGERS, of this office,
interviewed Senator [redacted] at the Senate Chambers, Colorado State Capitol
Building, Senator [redacted] verified the date and location where he had seen
the object. He described the object as being shaped like a dirigible, slightly
barrel-shaped with a large front and and tapering toward the tail. He compared
the object when he observed it in the sky to three-fourths of the diameter of
a fifty gallon barrel and approximately twice the length with a tapering tail.
He said that the object was greenish-blue in color, appeared luminous, seemed
to be of a jelly-like substance and had no distinguishable features. The object did not make any sound nor was any exhaust or trail made. He estimated
that the object was approximately 15,000 feet elevation above sea level, traveled
the speed of a meteorite. He stated that suddenly disappeared from view over
lit. Hestas. He estimated that the object was in his sight for approximately
five seconds and he estimated the speed of the object as being about one-half
the speed of a meteorite. He stated that the object suddenly appeared from
view almost overhead diving at approximately a 45 degree angle, leveled off
and ascended at approximately a 30 degree angle until its disappearance. He
stated that the flight line of the object would have been from southwest to
northeast. He estimated the altitude of the object as approximately 7000 to 8000
feet. He said that the time of the sighting was approximately 1030 hours 25
November 1955, that there was an unlimited ceiling, and that there were no
clouds or thunderstorms in the area. In conclusion, Senator [redacted] stated

(Cont'd)

that it is his belief that Mr. and Mrs. ________, owners of the Alpine
Cafe, Walsenburg, Colorado, had also observed an unidentified object on the
same date and that it could possibly have been the same one that he had ob-
served.

4. On 18 January 1956, S/A LEONARD F. REDDISH, of this office, inter-
viewed Jr. and Mrs. ________, Walsenburg, Colorado. The ________ stated
that on or about 1 December 1955 when driving approximately twenty-nine miles
south of Pueblo at 1600 hours they observed an unidentified flying object
which started that his attention was called to the object by what could be
called a vapor trail. He said that the object appeared to be white in color,
was shaped roughly like a cigarette with a pure white color, apparently "flov-
ing" at the top. He said that they observed the object for approximately
twenty minutes and that its movement was too slow for a jet. He said that
there were no clouds in the sky on that day and there is no normal air travel
in that area. He said that the last he saw of the object was when he was
approaching Walsenburg when it apparently disappeared over it. Baldy.
