This document does not appear to contain any photographs. The image shows a typed report from the Project Blue Book archives, specifically a "STATE MENT" regarding a UFO observation at Brooks AFB in Texas.

The text of the document is as follows:

At 0930 AM I was called from my office by a group of enlisted men standing in front of my office at 315 located at Brooks AFB. We saw an object that was in the sky. I just observed this object which at first glance appeared to be something drifting. It was pointed out to me that this object was hovering and it was then I noticed that it was just hovering in approximately the same spot and a seemed to wobble occasionally. It maintained this hovering position for approximately 5 minutes and then suddenly the size appeared to grow considerably and two more of these same objects traveling at a tremendous speed appeared to come towards the first object and also seemed to hover. All three of these objects then appeared to go into a steep climb and disappear from sight. The first object was described as being in a round or saucer like shape and still continued to wobble. I was the scene and called Base Operations and asked if they had picked up anything on radar and they said no. The only equipment they had was an APQ 13 which whether or not was in operation at the time I could not ascertain. Approximately five minutes after these objects were last observed it did not disappear until 1010 AM and when it did it also left on a heading of about 270_. I would estimate these objects were between forty (40) and fifty (50) thousand feet. No noise was heard and there were no obvious trails made by the objects.

STATEMENT

At about 0915, 9 October 1952 I observed several people standing in front of a building. I looked up in the sky and saw a round object. As I watched this object, it seemed to get smaller and move up in the sky. This object seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed. At that time I became interested and went out in front of the building. I had already called several other people and they came out and observed this object with me. This object seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed across the sky and remained in sight for approximately 15 minutes. At one point I became convinced that it was a weather balloon and so remarked. Immediately, though, it was a weather balloon and so remarked. Immediately, though, it seemed to veer suddenly and go straight up and out of sight. At that time I came to the conclusion that this was not due to my eyes, since we were looking almost directly at it. There were no clouds in the sky, it was a clear day. I did not perceptibly change color or shape as I watched it.

STATEMENT

Between 0920 and 1000 hours on the 9th of October 1952 I saw what I thought was a weather balloon at about two thousand feet. Moving into a position that was directly overhead, at a very slow speed, I observed this object for about 15 to 20 minutes.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

STATEMENT

On the day of 6 October 1952 at the hours of 0930 to 1030 A.M. Brooks AFB, Texas, airforce personnel, I saw hovering in the sky at about 10,000 feet an unidentified object. It was flying along in one place then darting off to the Northwest, I say it in several places. The object gave off a silvery glow, and seemed to be about the size of a medium bomber plane. I could see no windows, nor any exhaust or jet. At various times the object would appear to stop and hover momentarily, then dart off in another direction which I believe was westerly.

The text mentions that the object was located approximately 15° east of the south and that it was difficult to estimate its exact nature, as it appeared to be circular and metallic or white in color.

Text from the document:
A STATEMENT

A was shown an object in the sky located approximately 15° East of South. Objects appeared circular and metallic or white in color. Difficult to estimate exact nature as the light was being reflected from it in such a way that it appeared rather luminous at times. Object appeared to remain stationary and did not drift with the wind. At times there were white, fleecy bits of material floating in the sky which seemed to be approximately the same type as the object, but they quickly passed from view. These were not the object. When I left there were still white, fleecy bits of material floating in the sky at approximately the same position as the object had been. It did not drift.
