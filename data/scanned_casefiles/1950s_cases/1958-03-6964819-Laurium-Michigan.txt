Here is the text I can read from the document:

19 MAR 52

[Top right corner has number "33"]

[Some text appears to be partially illegible in the main body of the document]

At the bottom right, there is a handwritten note that appears to say:
"Wing must try
on Panel Test
of T..."
[Rest of handwritten text is partially illegible]

The document appears to have hole punches on the right side and seems to be a typewritten document with some handwritten annotations.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

The rest of the typed text in the middle of the page is too illegible for me to confidently transcribe.
