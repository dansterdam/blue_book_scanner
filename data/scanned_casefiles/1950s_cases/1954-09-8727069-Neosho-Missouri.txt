1. [REDACTED] a social agent in Charge, Little Rock, Arkansas, Field Division [redacted] of Investigation, advised his district that [redacted] Little Rock, Arkansas, had submitted a written report in which it reflected that at approximately 5:30 P.M. on September 19th, he observed an unidentified flying object near Neosho, Missouri.

2. Mr. [REDACTED] Little Rock, Arkansas, voluntarily appeared and submitted a typewritten report to the Little Rock, Arkansas Field Division, Special Investigations, for whatever purpose it might serve. In this report, [redacted] claims to have sighted an unidentified flying object. The contents of this report are set forth below:

Report on Unidentified Flying Object

Date: Sept. 24, 1954
Time: 5:34 p.m.
Location: approx. one mile north of main entrance to Camp Cherokee, just south of Neosho, Co. on U.S. Highway 71

Apparent height at first observation: 10,000 to 12,000 feet.
Apparent diameter of object: 20 to 30 feet.

Circumstances: The aerial view, together with his wife's, was driving along Highway 71 en route from Carthage, Mo., to Neytsville, Mo. I happened to slow down to about 20 miles per hour, driving around a slight curve, observed the object, and immediately stopped counting seconds at the same time. I have had considerable training in counting.

"seconds and seldom err more than plus or minus 10%. It required about 6 seconds to stop and I observed the object intermittently during this short interval. It had a slight rolling motion, but never more than 90 degrees. First counter-clockwise, then the reverse, before making the first loop (as per the attached sketch). The visible surface was presented somewhat obliquely during the first lateral travel, more or less making the first loop and almost edge-on at the second loop (seconds 11-12).

During the first 6 seconds in trying to stop and also note the actions of the object, it seemed that the side presented to view had four quadrature markings in the saucer-shaped object, but whether these were projections, depressions or merely coloration, is doubtful. This is what gave the impression of the rolling motion. During the span of the first 6 seconds, speed of the object was comparatively leisurely, being 6 to eight times its own diameter per second. It then increased its speed and also receded at a rapid rate and by the time it had increased its first point of observation at 11 seconds, it was traveling 20 to 30 times its own diameter per second and also presented the edge-wise view. The apparent diameter was now a half to a third of its first-observed size, and during the fleeting glimpse I had of the top-side, there was possibly a projection somewhat resembling the conning tower of a submarine.

The speed with which things were happening and the uncertainties of lighting at this time of day make such an observation of little value. After completing the second loop, at seconds 14, speed of the object increased still further both transversely and receding, and at seconds 24 it had become completely invisible. There was no sign of smoke or vapor emanating from the object, nor was there any sound, but this could not be strictly determined because of the noise of oncoming traffic while observation was in progress."

"CONCLUSIONS"

"For what they may be worth, this reporter submits the following conclusions regarding the above observation:

"First, occupants of the object decided to ascend to heights beyond visibility when they found they were being observed. It is likely that others were interested, like the undersigned, and there may have been radar or other means of determining location and size at work on the Camp Crowder reservation.

"Second, means of propulsion of the object was some form of power not generally known, probably atomic, because of the sudden acceleration and terrific speed developed.

"Third, the object did not depend on air for support or guidance, because the loops at seconds 11-12 and 21-22 were too abrupt for air-supported devices. That is, unless the object was considerably smaller than it appeared.

"This reporter recognizes that the suddenness of the occasion for the observation and the lack of means for establishing true distances and sizes make this observation of doubtful value, but it may lead to more substantial information."

3. The evaluation of this report has been placed at E-4, since it is impossible to properly evaluate the information without further interview of Mr. KELLY.

4. ACTION: Copies of this report with inclosure have been furnished the Commanding General, Air Material Command.

5. This report is classified CONFIDENTIAL pursuant to authority contained in paragraph 24a, AFR 205-1.

The image appears to be a scanned document page with significant fading and low contrast. While I can see text is present, much of it is illegible due to the poor image quality. Some words and partial sentences are visible, but I cannot confidently reproduce the full text without risking inaccuracy. The document seems to be a typewritten report with multiple paragraphs, but the specific content is not clearly discernible.

Here is the text from the document:

fleeting glimpse I had of the top-side, there possibly was a projection somewhat resembling the coming tower of a submarine. The speed with which things were happening and the uncertainties of lighting at this time of day makes such an observation of little value.

After completing the second loop at second 24, the speed of the object increased still further both transversely and receding, and at second 24 it had become completely invisible.

There was no sign of smoke or vapor emanating from the object, nor was there any sound, but this could not be strictly determined because of the noise of occurring traffic while observation was in progress.

CONCLUSIONS

For what they may be worth, this report submits the following conclusions:

First, occupants of the object decided to ascend to height beyond a limit then formed, their speed changed at this point and rate may have been radar or other method of determining location and rate at various points.

Second, speed of propulsion of the object was more or less erratic, probably erratic, because of the evident acceleration and erratic speed developed.

Third, the object did not depend on air for support or guidance, because the loops at seconds 11-12 and 21-22 were too sharp for air-supported devices. This would be unless the object was considerably smaller than it appeared.

This reporter recognizes that the substance of this report is limited in the ability to establish true distances, and size of object, but it may lead to more substantial information.
