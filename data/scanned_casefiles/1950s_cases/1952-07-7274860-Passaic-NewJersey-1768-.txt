The image contains a photograph that appears to show a dark, oval-shaped object in the sky above some trees. The text accompanying the image describes the photograph as being allegedly taken by two men in Passaic, New Jersey on July 31, 1952. The text states that the photographs were brought to the attention of ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) by a phone call, but were never proven to be a hoax. The text also discusses the size and appearance of the object in the photograph, noting that it appears larger than a typical photograph object, even though it is close to the photographer. The text concludes by stating that it would be relatively simple for even a person not completely familiar with photography to "detect" the "false" nature of these photos.

Passaic, New Jersey - 31 July 1952  
These photographs were allegedly taken by two men at Passaic, New Jersey on 31 July 1952, using a Kodak Vigilant II camera. The photos were brought to the attention of ATIC by a phone call from a writer of popular magazines. The photos were never proven to be a hoax; however, there are several points which cast doubt on the authenticity of the object. 
The photos were never gone over closely, one of them is the fact that the object appears to be larger, even though it is close to the photographer, than one would expect. Another point is that the photographer did not long enough for the photographer to observe it, go into the house and get a camera and take the photos and still have the object appear relatively unchanged. Since it should have moved quite a bit through the sky in the time taken.
It would be relatively simple for even a person not completely familiar with photography to "detect" these photos.
