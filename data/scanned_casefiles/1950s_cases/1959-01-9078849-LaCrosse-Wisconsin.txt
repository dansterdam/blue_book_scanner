Dear Sir:
This report is a little late but I hope you will be interested enough to help us out.

The enclosed clipping will explain what I am after.
Is it just another in a series of reports you are compelled, due to lack of information or release, to add to the heap?
Or is there some light you can possible shed here?
Any help you can give will be appreciated.

Yours very truly,

18 JAN 59

19 February 1959

This is to acknowledge your letter of 26 January 1959 concerning news story on an unidentified flying object seen over La Crosse, Wisconsin, on 18 January 1959.

A thorough search of our records indicates this particular sighting was not reported to the Air Force.

A check with Air Force radar and weather stations in the area failed to detect any vehicle or balloon in the area at the time which would cause the effects described in the news article.

The fact that Civil Aeronautics Administration personnel and local airport officials saw nothing unusual is also considered significant.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

NO EXPLANATION

Fiery, Fast-Flying
Object Seen In Sky

West Salem and La Crosse residents early Sunday reported seeing a fiery object in the sky traveling at a very high rate of speed. But officials at the Civil Aeronautics Administration and United States Weather Bureau facilities at La Crosse Municipal Airport could shed no light on what it was. The officials personally had not witnessed anything new in the sky at that hour.

At West Salem, it was reported, several persons at various places saw a bright flash of light about 6 a.m., traveling from east to west.

Ross Fuller was driving on Highway 16 and said the lights shone brightly into his car. Joe Larson, a resident at a hotel downtown, witnessed it as did Mr. Hendrickson of Northern state Power Co. Oscar Sternard said he was at home when he noticed a bright light flash through the windows about the same hour but he attributed it possibly to a passing car.

Finn A. Johnson, a meteorological technician at the USWB, reported to his administrator, that several persons called at about 6 a.m. to report the incident. Norwalk, CAA official, said the object had no record of unusual sky happenings and that a log on aircraft showed no mention of "foreign" objects at that hour.

The sun, according to weather bureau records, did not rise until 7:35 a.m., discounting that as a factor in the report.
