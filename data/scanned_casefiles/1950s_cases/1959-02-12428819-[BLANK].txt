MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Conference

1. A meeting was held at the Department of Air Force, AFOIN, at 1330 on 17 Feb 1959, for the purpose of discussing the Air Force philosophy toward and policy regarding the Unidentified Flying Objects Program. The following persons associated with the program were present:

Mr. A. Francis Arcier, AFCIN-4
Col L. T. Glaser, AFCIN-4E4
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Air Force Scientific Consultant UFO Program
Mr. B. L. Griffing, AFCIN-4E4
Maj J. F. Byrne, AFCIN-XIA
Maj L. J. Tacker, SAFIS-3
Maj J. E. Boland, SAFIL
Maj R. J. Friend, AFCIN-4E4

2. Brief on Dr. Hynek:

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Astrophysicist, Ohio State University, presently on leave of absence to act as Associate Director of the Satellite Tracking Program for the Smithsonian Institute.

Dr. Hynek has been the Air Force's scientific consultant on the UFO Program for ten years and has been invaluable in this capacity.

Dr. Hynek suggested this meeting to allow him to air some of his views on the UFO Program and his personal problem of adverse publicity. (Letters and publications intimating his only interest in the UFO Program was for financial gain.)

Dr. Hynek indicated that he felt the Air Force had done a good job of handling a very difficult program with the limited resources available. The purpose of the meeting being to improve on these resources and other facets of the program in an effort to improve on our job.

3. The agenda is attached as TAB-A

4. Discussion, Conclusions and Suggestions:

a. Official Name of the Program:

It was concluded that the present name of "Unidentified Flying Objects" was not appropriate and that a name change was desirable. However, it was felt that this was not the proper time for a change due to the possibility of supplying the UFO fanatics with ammunition. In this connection it was decided to no longer identify the unsolved cases as "unknowns" but rather as "unidentified."

Dear Dr. Wyatt:

My name is Hayden Hance, I am the associate director of the Interplanetary Intelligent-of Unidentified Flying Objects, etc. I am a graduate of Ohio State University and now reside in Oklahoma City. The purpose of our organization is to study and investigate all UFO sightings hitherto and try to prove if flying saucers are real or not.

The NICAP has a panel of men known as the technical advisory board that are very knowledgeable in the flying saucer field. They help us come to a conclusion on our investigation and reports that are sent in to us by members of our organization.

We are now endeavoring to gather a panel of men that are well-versed in different fields. After our exploration board and some scientific analysis, this will help us be able to scientifically analyze the way we can get all the facts and draw the right conclusions. Then we can publish our findings. We are receiving many calls by people in our regular publication, even if the flying cause turns out not to be a flying saucer.

We were wondering if you with your background as a member of our scientific panel, since you are well recognized as a ufologist.

We understand that you are very busy, but it would take just a few minutes to give us your opinion on the enclosed material.

Thanking to hear from you in your future.

Yours very truly,
Hayden Hance

Air Force 10 year Study of Unidentified Flying Objects

In response to queries as to results of previous investigation of Unidentified Flying Object reports, the Air Force said today that after 10 years of investigation and evaluation of UFO's, an evidence has been discovered to confirm the existence of so-called "FLYING SAUCERS".

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, professor of Astrophysics and Astronomy at Ohio State University is the Chief Scientific Consultant to the Air Force on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects.

THE REPORT CONCLUDES WITH THIS PUBLIC PROMISE:

The Air Force, assigned the responsibility for the Air Defense of the United States, will continue to investigate, through the Air Defense Command all reports of of unusual aerial objects over the U.S. including objects that may become unidentified flying objects. The service and qualified scientists and technicians will continue to investigate and analyze these reports, and periodic public statements will be made as warranted.

END ------

THE SPACE-CRAFT DIGEST charges that this is outright falsehoodd. Such an investigation is NOT being carried on as promised. The instance of UFO violation of the air space of US has gone uninvestigated much as these pages of the SPACE-CRAFT DIGEST have been edited by Dr. HYNEK, who is on the public payroll to do a job, doesn't even answer a query from a who stations concerning the UFO problem.

His secretary wrote, 'off hand' the 'truth-telling' doctor there is no reply because he apparently is one of the Ph. D's hired by the Air Force to produce a "public whitewash" of this fantastic world-wide phenomena.

As a former Naval Radar radio officer, a graduate electrical engineer the editor realizes that these charges are serious. BUT - at the same time - the possibility that the USSR or Red China discover the secret of electrical. While the giant armed forces budget fuels with rockets to the bursting point of this nation some voice must rise. At least the fumbling military can do is to stop ignoring those who do fly in space.

BY JOSEPH L. MYLER

UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL

WASHINGTON, JAN. 27--(UPI)--PEOPLE ARE SEEING FEWER FLYING SAUCERS, AND A PSYCHIATRIST HERE THINKS MAYBE SAUCERS ARE GOING OUT OF FASHION, I. THEY ARE, HOWEVER, DR. ADDISON M. DUVAL IS SURE "SOMETHING ELSE WILL COME INTO STYLE."

DUVAL, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF WASHINGTON'S FAMOUS ST. ELIZABETHS HOSPITAL, TOLD UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL THAT SEEING THINGS WHICH DON'T EXIST IS A COMMON RESULT OF ANXIETY GENERATED BY FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN.

AND THE TIMES AREN'T GETTING ANY LESS ANXIOUS OR THE FUTURE ANY LESS UNCERTAIN.

OF COURSE, NOT EVERYBODY WHO SEES WHAT THE AIR FORCE CALLS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) IS MENTALLY SICK. BUT SOME SIGHTERS, DUVAL BELIEVES, ARE SUFFERING FROM DELUSIONS OR HALLUCINATIONS.

THE AIR FORCE REPORTED LAST WEEK THAT UFO REPORTS FELL OFF 14 PER CENT IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1958 TO A TOTAL OF 256. MOST OF THESE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED AS REAL THINGS--PLANES, BALLOONS, SHOOTING STARS, PLANETS, AND EVEN EARTH SATELLITES.

THE AIR FORCE FOUND THAT FOUR OF THE 256 UFO'S WERE ARTIFICIAL MOONS SIGHTED AS THEY WINKED THEIR WAY ACROSS THE SKY. IT LISTED FEWER THAN ONE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL AS "UNKNOWN"--MEANING THAT THE AIR FORCE COULDN'T FIND OUT WHAT THE THING REPORTED ACTUALLY WAS.

AS FOR NON-RATIONAL UFO SIGHTINGS, DUVAL SAID "WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREDICT THE FLYING SAUCER CRAZE. WHENEVER SOMETHING CAPTURES THE INTEREST OF PEOPLE GENERALLY, HE SAID, IT USUALLY SHOWS UP IN DELUSIONS OF THE MENTALLY ILL.

DUVAL RECALLS A PERIOD WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE PART OF THE "AMOS 'N' ANDY" RADIO TEAM.

IF THE FLYING SAUCER DELUSION IS ON THE DECLINE, ONE REASON MAY BE THAT SAUCERS ARE GETTING "TOO MUCH COMPETITION FROM REAL THINGS--SATELLITES, LUNAR PROBES, SUN ROCKETS," DUVAL SAID. AFTER A WHILE ANY WIDELY SHARED DELUSION TENDS, HE SAID, "TO GET OUT OF STYLE."

HE THINKS THE NEXT DELUSION MAY BE AN ELABORATION OF THE SPACE-TRAVEL MOTIF. BUT JUST WHAT FORM IT WILL TAKE HE COULDN'T GUESS.

b. Dr. Hynek's Problem of Adverse Publicity:

Several solutions for Dr. Hynek's problem of adverse publicity were proposed, the most drastic of which was to have Dr. Hynek withdraw from his present position as scientific consultant for one or two years. It was the consensus of opinion that any solution which cost the services of Dr. Hynek would be unsuitable due to his immense value to the program. The course of action decided upon to attempt to correct this problem was to omit the use of Dr. Hynek's name in any of the official release on the UFO subject. Further Dr. Hynek is to forward all letters received him on the UFO subject to SAFIS-3 for reply. Dr. Hynek to maintain his present status until it can be determined if the new positive and more scientific approach to the program would reduce if not eliminate his problem of adverse publicity. The release of Dr. Hynek to be only a last resort solution.

c. Education of the Public:

It was concluded that the Air Force should direct positive efforts toward taking full advantage of all favorable publicity associated in any way with the UFO Program. That specific efforts should be made toward producing information which would educate the public and be advantageous to the UFO Program. Fictitious and/or descriptions of the phenomena or objects determined as being probably responsible for a sighting should accompany the news releases. It was decided that a collection of such pictures should be made and filed for this purpose.

d. Rapid Processing of Information to SAFIS:

In all instances SAFIS should be notified as soon as possible what the probable Air Technical Intelligence Center's analysis will be and particularly in the case of those sightings which are being given the "full blower" technique by the press. It helps the Air Force's position if SAFIS can give positive information that the investigators are at the location of the sighting and the official investigation underway.

e. Investigation and Reporting:

It was decided that the Air Force's investigation and reporting processes in connection with the UFO Program needed revamping. The conclusions were that the investigations should be more scientific, faster and more complete. In order to accomplish this improvement in investigation techniques, it was decided that AFR 200-2, dated 5 Feb 1958, which outlines the responsibilities and requirements of the Air Force Agencies responsible for these investigations be revised. This revision to outline more specifically responsibilities, also to outline the desired qualifications of selected investigators, and to list equipment with which each investigation team should be supplied. Further, a suggested training course which should be given to all personnel selected as investigators should be supplied. (See TABE-5). It was also suggested that the investigators from the 1006th AISS be brought to ATIC for an

WASHINGTON, FEB. 10 --(UP)--MAJ. GEN. WILLIAM W. DICK JR., ARMY SPECIAL WEAPONS CHIEF, WAS ASKED IF HE HAD INFORMATION ON FLYING SAUCER REPORTS. "I AM AFRAID," HE REPLIED WITH FEAR AND TREPIDATION, "THE GENERAL REPLY IS 'BECAUSE MY WIFE BELIEVES IN FLYING SAUCERS.' ESPECIALLY, THE ARMY MISSILE EXPERT SAID YESTERDAY AFTER CHASING ONE ONLY TO FIND OUT IT WAS A FLOCK OF BIRDS.

WASHINGTON, JAN. 22--(UPI)--THE AIR FORCE INDICATED TODAY THAT THERE AREN'T AS MANY "FLYING SAUCERS" AS THERE USED TO BE. IT DID NOT PUT IT JUST THAT WAY, OF COURSE, BECAUSE IT HAS NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS A FLYING SAUCER. IN FACT, THE AIR FORCE HAS SAID THERE IS NO SUCH THING.

WHAT THE SERVICE DID WAS TO ISSUE A NEW REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO) IN WHICH IT SAID THAT THE NUMBER OF "UNKNOWN" CASES HAD BEEN REDUCED TO A FRACTION OF ONE PERCENT AFTER INVESTIGATION.

IN THE LAST HALF OF 1958, THE AIR FORCE ANALYZED 296 UFO REPORTS AND CATALOGUED ONLY TWO AS CASES OF "UNKNOWNS":

23 BALLOONS, 64 AIRCRAFT, 96 ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENON, 4 SATELLITES, 50 OTHER* SUCH AS HOAXES, LIGHTS AND BIRDS, 61 IGNORED BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT DATA SUPPLIED BY PERSONS REPORTING SIGHTINGS.

*SATELLITES BECAME A NEW UFO CATEGORY IN 1958.

AFR 200-2 DATED 5 FEBRUARY 1958,
AND CHANGE THERETO DATED 3 JULY 1958

1. This regulation as it stands serves well the purpose for which
it was written. However, the Air Force investigators are doing little
more than meeting the minimum requirements of this document, and in many
instances require prompting by the Air Technical Intelligence Center to
deliver even this minimum data.

2. The shortcomings of the UFO investigation procedures probably
are due mostly to the Air Bases assigning inexperienced and/or unqualified
people to this task, and also to lack of interest in the Program. It is
difficult to become fired up over a Program in which the boss shows little
or no interest.

3. The ATIC proposes the following as a solution to the problems
associated with UFO investigation.

a. Assignment of competent persons as investigators.

b. Short training program for the personnel proposed for use
as investigators. The length of this training program should depend upon
the basic qualifications of the personnel selected. However, it is
suggested that such a training program not exceed twenty (20) hours. In
all instances the program should include hours of instruction on the
following:

(1) History and philosophy of the UFO Program.

(2) Introduction to Astronomy (Basic terminology and
description of the more common astronomical bodies).

(3) Methods of interrogation.

(4) Use of equipment.

(5) Reporting.


- page 14 -

c. The following is a list of equipment with which every UFO investigation team should be supplied:

(1) Geiger Counter
(2) Camera
(3) Tape recorder
(4) Binoculars
(5) Magnifying glass

4. The investigating teams should be authorized to make phone calls directly to the Air Technical Intelligence Center from the investigation area for the purpose of reporting high priority findings or preliminary conclusions.

ATIO,
Wright-Patterson, Ohio

Dear Sirs,

In a renewed attempt to secure factual information concerning UFO's in general and, in particular, information concerning the Olden Moore sighting of Nov. 6, 1957, near Huntsburg and Montville, Ohio, Nov. 6, 1957, I am following General Moore's suggestion that I again write your offices, I do this reluctantly, as I have from the ATIC staff at this advance always an evasive answer or deliberate false-hoods to those who ask factual questions concerning UFO's.

You have received my reports on this case as well as many other reports. You know that the final O.D. report has been released. You know that this case was broadcast over television, radio, and the press. You know that even Anne Winch of the press in his French text, "Flying Saucers and the Straight-Line Mystery." Too, you know that dozens of government agents were on the landing field soon after the craft landed as reported by Olden Moore.

I mention these facts as I do not wish to be embarrassed by Herr Goebhels-like statements that - you know nothing about the Olden Moore sighting, or that the facts are too sketchy.

Specifically, how do you explain the foot or shoe prints and the deep markings left by the craft and its occupants? More important, what caused the craft to leave a high degree of radio-activity?

This matter, and most important question is most important as a point of time (among others) soon after viewing a UFO at close range and for a long most two years after viewing a UFO. This, sire, is a matter of civilian defense and I consider it worthy of serious consideration.

Your answer to these questions can help me and others to help our fellow man who may still believe that UFO's are harmless or who are deluded by your and others propaganda that they do not exist.

Dr. Carl G. Jung, famed psychologist has stated, "If it is true that the AAF (American Air Force) withholds telling facts then one can only say it is a psychological and stupid policy one could could invent...the public ought to be told the truth."

Sirs, UFO's have inflicted death and damage to many Americans. Some of this death and damage will have been avoided had Americans been given the truth. You can give the Americans this truth if you are interested in civilian Americans. Hence, I again ask for a specific answer to the specific questions in paragraph four. If you cannot give this, you have no option to specify the specific governmental office and the specific persons responsible for keeping the UFO truths from a former free people!

Sincerely,
Dan B. Haber

On 15 and 16 January 1953, upon request of the Director of Intelligence of the Air Force a Scientific Advisory Panel was established.

The general conclusions reached by the panel were that unidentified flying objects:

a. Held no direct physical threat.

b. Were not foreign developments capable of hostile acts to the U.S.

c. Were not unknown phenomena requiring the revision of current scientific concepts.

The panel further concluded that unless de-emphasized, UFOs did constitute a threat to the orderly functioning of the protective units of the body politic, because:

a. Unwarranted mass of irrelevant reports could clog vital channels of communications.

b. Skillful hostile propagandists could induce national hysterical behavior and harmful distrust of duly constituted authority.

c. Continued false reports might hide indications of a genuine hostile action.

As a result, the panel made the following basic recommendations:

a. That immediate steps be taken to strip UFOs of the aura of mystery which they had unfortunately acquired, to reassure the public of the total lack of evidence of inimical forces behind the phenomena.

b. That investigating and reporting personnel be trained to recognize and reject false indications quickly and effectively.

indoctrination course outlining those factors of investigation peculiar to UFO cases.

f. Analysis and Evaluation:

It was felt that in the past many cases were given an un-scientific and "fast brush" treatment in an effort to get them filed. It was decided that the approach should be more scientific and positive. Unless the analyst could be sure of his conclusions beyond doubt, then a statement in the vein of the following should summarize his analysis:

"There is no evidence available to indicate that the object sighted in this case was not a meteor" or "In view of all the available evidence, the object of this sighting was probably a meteor."

It was also suggested that a panel of qualified men, in diversified fields be formed and used for consultation. The men on this panel to be qualified in the following areas:

Sociology
Astronomy
Psychology
Physics
Public Relations

This panel to be used on an "on-call" basis, but to meet at least once each month; at which time a summary of the months activities will be presented to them. The purpose of this panel is to review some of the more troublesome cases, spot trends in the program and make suggestions as to the future outlook. The formation of this panel to be given further consideration by the ATIC.

g. Re-evaluation of Old Cases:

Many UFO organizations have been constantly reopening the more sensational of the old cases to the further embarrassment of the Air Force. It was decided that the Aerial Phenomena Group, AFCIN-4/Leg, would review these old cases, with in view of greater scientific knowledge and experience, may be removed from the "unknown" category and reclassified as a "probable."

h. Claims of UFO Organizations:

In many instances the private UFO organizations, or their sponsors, have made claims that some individual, usually a person held in high esteem by the public, has made some sympathetic statement with the views of the organization. It was decided that SA-15-3 would write letters to each person so quoted and ask for corroboration or denial, and for further detail if in the affirmative.

AFR 200-2 DATED 5 FEBRUARY 1958,
AND CHANGE THERETO DATED 3 JULY 1958

1. This regulation as it stands serves well the purpose for which it was written. However, the Air Force investigators are doing little more than meeting the minimum requirements of this document, and in many instances require prompting by the Air Technical Intelligence Center to deliver even this minimum data.

2. The shortcomings of the UFO investigation procedures probably are due mostly to the Air Bases assigning inexperienced and/or unqualified people to this task, and also to lack of interest in the Program. It is difficult to become fired up over a Program in which the boss shows little or no interest.

3. The ATIC proposes the following as a solution to the problems associated with UFO investigation.
    a. Assignment of competent persons as investigators.
    b. Short training program for the personnel proposed for use as investigators. The length of this training program should depend upon the basic qualifications of the personnel selected. However, it is suggested that such a training program not exceed twenty (20) hours. In all instances the program should include hours of instruction on the following:

    (1) History and philosophy of the UFO Program.
    (2) Introduction to Astronomy (Basic terminology and description of the more common astronomical bodies).
    (3) Methods of interrogation.
    (4) Use of equipment.
    (5) Reporting.

The text appears to be handwritten and somewhat difficult to read clearly. However, I can make out some parts:

UFO Wkly 17 Feb 83

Rankin, Huyghue, Bouldin, Walden

There are several lines of handwritten text in the middle of the document, but due to the handwriting style and image quality, I cannot confidently transcribe the full text. Some words are legible, but many are not clear enough to accurately reproduce.

The document has four hole punches, two at the top and two at the bottom of the page.
