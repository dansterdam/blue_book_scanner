MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD                                                         (AFR 190-16)

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Conference

     1. A meeting was held at the Department of Air Force, ATICN,
at 1330 on 17 Feb 1959, for the purpose of discussing the Air Force
philosophy toward and policy regarding the Unidentified Flying Objects
Program. The following persons associated with the program were present:

           Mr. A. Francis Arcier, AFCIN-IN-
           Col L. T. Glasser, ATICN/LY
           Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Air Force Scientific
           Consultant UFO Program
           Mr. B. L. Griffing, ATICN/LE
           Maj J. F. Byrne, AFCIN-XIA
           Maj J. J. Tacker, SAFIS-S
           Maj J. E. Boland, SAFIL
           Maj R. J. Friend, ATICN/TH

     2. Brief on Dr. Hynek:

           Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Astrophysicist, Ohio State University,
presently on leave of absence to act as Associate Director of the
Satellite Tracking Program for the Smithsonian Institute.

           Dr. Hynek has been the Air Force's scientific consultant on
the UFO Program for ten years and has been invaluable in this capacity.

           Dr. Hynek suggested this meeting to allow him to air some of
his views on the UFO Program and his personal problem of adverse publicity.
(Letters and publications intimating his only interest in the UFO Program
was for financial gain.)

           Dr. Hynek indicated that he felt the Air Force had done a
good job of handling a very difficult program with the limited resources
available. The purpose of the meeting being to improve on these resources
and other facets of the program in an effort to improve on our job.

     3. The agenda is attached as TAB-A

     4. Discussion, Conclusions and Suggestions:

          a. Official Name of the Program:

           It was concluded that the present name of "Unidentified
Flying Objects" was not appropriate and that a name change was desirable.
However, it was felt that this was not the proper time for a change due
to the possibility of supplying the UFO fanatics with ammunition for a
new attack. This subject is to be given further consideration. In this
connection it was decided to no longer identify the unsolved cases as
"unknowns" but rather as "unidentified."

     (2) Dr. Hynek's problem of adverse publicity.
     
     (3) Education of public - advantage taken of all favorable
         publicity.
         
     (4) Rapid processing of information on reported cases to
         prevent possible “snow-balling” at SA/INS.
         
3. Attacking the Problem.

  a. Reporting.
  
     (1) Speed.

J. Allen Hynek
Director of Astrophysical
Ohio State University
Columbus, Ohio

Dear Dr. Hynek:

My name is Hayden Hughes, I am the associate director
of the International Unidentified Flying
Object, which is a research unit with kind quarters in Old
home City. The purpose of our organization is to study and in-
vestigate UFO sightings over the United States and try to un-
cover the flying saucers RBS real or not.

This IHUFO has a panel of men known as the technical
advisory board. This men are highly recognized men in the fly-
ing saucer field. They help us come to a conclusion on our in-
reports that are sent into us by members of our organization.

We are now volunteering to organize a panel of men that
are authorities in different fields. After our evaluation board
has come to a conclusion, the flying skill be sent on to our
panel to analyze ruminate way. Our goal here is that one
day it could have so much facts and true information to end
all the mystical stories or non-existent saucers are Valid they
will be provided in our regularly publication even if the fly-
ing saucers stories would false or the flying saucers.

We were considering if you would become a member of our
scientific panel since you are highly recognized as an astrophysi-
cist.

We understand that you are a very busy man, but we would take
no more than we hope about sixty minutes. We could provide op-
a flying saucer to take the place of the examination.

Trusting to hear from you in the near future.

Very truly yours,

/s/ Hayden Hughes

NEWS RELEASE
PLEASE NOTE DATE

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
OFFICE OF PUBLIC INFORMATION
Washington 25, D. C.

Fact Sheet

November 5, 1957 No. 1038-58
L5-6700 EXT. 75131

Air Force 10 year Study of Unidentified Flying Objects

In response to queries as to results of previous investigation of Unidentified Flying Object reports, the Air Force said today that after 10 years of investigation and evaluation of UFO’s no evidence has been discovered to confirm the existence of so-called "FLYING SAUCERS".

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Professor of Astrophysics and Astronomy at Ohio State University in the Chief Scientific Consultant to the Air Force on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects.

THE REPORT CONCLUDES WITH THIS PUBLIC PROMISE:

The Air Force, assigned the responsibility for the Air Defence of the United States, will continue to investigate, through the Air Defence Command and Department of unexplainable objects over the U.S. including objects that may become unidentified flying objects. The services of a qualified scientist and technician will continue to investigate and analyse these reports, and periodic public statements will END be made as warranted.

---

THE SPACE-CRAFT DIGEST charges that this is outright falsehood. Such an investigation is NOT being carried on as promised. balance after instance of UFO violation of the air-space of US has gone uninvestigated such as these we have noted on the preceding pages. But more than that--Dr. Hynek, who is on the public payroll to do a job doesn’t even answer a query from our radio station concerning the UFO problem, etc.

SECRETARY wrote, but from the "feather-bedding" doctor there is no reply because he apparently is one of the Ph.D.'s hired by the Air Force to produce a "public whitewash" of this fantastic world-wide phenomena.

As a former Naval Radar-radio officer, a graduate electrical engineer the editor realizes that these charges are serious. BUT--at the same time--the possibility that the U.S.S.R. or Red China or diverging aircraft of electrical flight is also serious. While the giant armed forces budget double with rockets the bumbling military cad nation stop voices must speak out. The least the troublemakers can do is to ask some questions. Those who do fly is peace with the vain hope that "they might go away."

W2                                                          BY JOSEPH L. MYLER
                                                               U^N^ED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
WASHINGTON, JAN. 27 --(UPI)-- PEOPLE ARE SEEING FEWER FLYING SAUCERS, 
AND A PSYCHIATRIST HERE THINKS MAYBE SAUCERS ARE GOING OUT OF FASHION. 
"I COME INTO STYLE," DR. ADDISON M. DUVAL IS SURE "SOMETHING ELSE 
WILL COME INTO STYLE."

DUVAL, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF WASHINGTON'S FAMOUS ST. ELIZABETHS HOS-
PITAL, TOLD UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL THAT SEEING THINGS WHICH 
DON'T EXIST IS A COMMON RESULT OF ANXIETY GENERATED BY FEAR OF THE 
UNKNOWN.

AND THE TIMES AREN'T GETTING ANY LESS ANXIOUS OR THE FUTURE ANY LESS 
UNCERTAIN.

OF COURSE, NOT EVERYBODY WHO SEES WHAT THE AIR FORCE CALLS AN 
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFC) IS MENTALLY SICK. BUT SOME SIGHTERS, 
DUVAL BELIEVES, ARE SUFFERING FROM DELUSIONS OR HALLUCINATIONS.

THE AIR FORCE REPORTED LAST WEEK THAT UFO REPORTS FELL OFF 14 PER 
CENT IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1958 TO A TOTAL OF 258. MOST OF THESE WERE 
SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED AS SATELLITES, PLANES, BALLOONS, SHOOTING 
STARS, PLANETS AND EVEN EARTH SHININGS."

THE AIR FORCE SAID THAT A TOTAL OF THE 259 UFOs WERE ARTIFICIAL MOONS 
SIGHTED AS THEY WINKED THEIR WAY ACROSS THE SKY. IT LISTED FEWER THAN 
ONE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL AS "UNKNOWN"--MEANING THAT THE AIR FORCE 
COULDN'T FIND OUT WHAT THE THING REPORTED ACTUALLY WAS.

AS FOR NON-RATIONAL UFO SIGHTINGS, DUVAL SAID "WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO PREDICT THE FLYING SAUCER CRAZE, WHENEVER SOMETHING CAPTURES 
THE INTEREST OF PEOPLE GENERALLY, HE SAID, "IT USUALLY SHOWS UP IN 
DELUSIONS OF THE MENTALLY ILL.

DUVAL RECALLS A PERIOD WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE PART OF 
THE FAMOUS 'FLY ANDY' RADIO TEAM.

"IF THE FLYING SAUCER DELUSION IS ON THE DECLINE, ONE REASON MAY BE 
THAT SAUCERS ARE GETTING TOO MUCH COMPETITION FROM REAL THINGS--
SATELLITES, LUNAR PROBES, 'SUN ROCKETS,'" DUVAL SAID. "AFTER A WHILE ANY 
WIDELY SHARED DELUSION TENDS, HE SAID," TO GET OUT OF STYLE."

HE THINKS THE NEXT DELUSION MAY BE AN ELABORATION OF THE SPACE-
TRAVEL MOTIF. BUT JUST WHAT FORM IT WILL TAKE HE COULDN'T GUESS.

(AFR 190-16)

b. Dr. Hynek's Problem of Adverse Publicity:

Several solutions for Dr. Hynek's problem of adverse pub-
licity were proposed, the most drastic of which was to have Dr. Hynek
withdraw from his present position as scientific consultant for one or
two years. It was the consensus of opinion that any solution which cost
the services of Dr. Hynek would be unsuitable due to his immense value
to the program. The course of action decided upon to attempt to correct
this problem was to omit the use of Dr. Hynek's name in any of the offi-
cial release on the UFO subject. Further. Dr. Hynek is to forward all
letters received by him on the UFO subject to SAIFS-3 for reply. Dr.
Hynek to maintain his present status until it can be determined if the
new positive and more scientific approach to the program would reduce
if not eliminate his problem of adverse publicity. The release of Dr.
Hynek to be only a last resort solution.
 
c. Education of the Public:

It was concluded that the Air Force should direct positive
efforts toward taking full advantage of all favorable publicity associated
in any way with the UFO Program. That specific efforts should be made
toward producing information which would educate the public and be ad-
vantageous to the UFO Program. Pictures and/or descriptions of the
phenomena or objects termed as flying saucer or type reports for the
sighting should accompany the news releases. It was decided that a
collection of such pictures should be made and filed for this purpose.

d. Rapid Processing of Information to SAIFS:

In all instances SAIFS should be notified as soon as
possible what the probable Air Technical Intelligence Center's analysis
will be and particularly in the case of those sightings which are being
given the "full blower" technique by the press. It helps the Air Force's
position if SAIFS can give positive information that the investigators 
are at the location of the sighting and the official investigation
underway.

e. Investigation and Reporting:

It was decided that the Air Force's investigation and 
reporting processes in connection with the UFO Program needed revamping.
The conclusions were that the investigations should be more scientific,
faster and more complete. In order to accomplish this improvement in
investigation techniques, it was decided that AFR 200-2, dated 5 Feb 1958,
which outlines the responsibilities and requirements of the Air Force
Agencies responsible for these investigations be revised. This revision
to outline more specifically responsibilities, also to outline the de-
tailed qualifications of selected investigators, and to list equipment
with which each investigation should be supplied. Further, a
suggested training course which should be given to all personnel selected
as investigators should be supplied (See TAB-E). It was also suggested
that the investigators from the 1006th AISS be brought to ATIC for an

                                  IN FACT, THE AIR FORCE HAS SAID THERE IS NO SUCH THING.

                                  IN THE LAST HALF OF 1958, THE AIR FORCE ANALYZED 269 UFO REPORTS
                                  AND CATALOGUED ONLY TWO AS CASES OF "UNKNOWNS".

AFR 200-2 DATED 5 FEBRUARY 1958,
AND CHANGE THERETO DATED 3 JULY 1958

1. This regulation as it stands serves well the purpose for which
it was written. However, the Air Force investigators are doing little
more than meeting the minimum requirements of this document, and in many
instances require prompting by the Air Technical Intelligence Center to
deliver even this minimum date.

2. The shortcomings of the UFO investigation procedures probably
are due mostly to the Air Bases assigning inexperienced and/or unqualified
people to this task, and also to lack of interest in the Program. It is
difficult to become fired up over a Program in which the boss shows little
or no interest.

3. The ATIC proposes the following as a solution to the problems
associated with UFO investigations.

a. Assignment of competent persons as investigators.

b. Short training program for the personnel proposed for use
as investigators. The length of this training program should depend upon
the basic qualifications of the personnel selected. However, it is
suggested that such a training program not exceed twenty (20) hours. In
all instances the program should include hours of instruction on the
following:

(1) History and philosophy of the UFO Program.

(2) Introduction to Astronomy (Basic terminology and
description of the more common astronomical bodies).

(3) Methods of interrogations.

(4) Use of equipment.

(5) Reporting.

```
RDA/AFOIN
Wright-Patterson, Ohio
2/6/59

ATIO,
Wright-Patterson, Ohio

Dear Sirs,

In a renewed attempt to secure factual information concerning
UFO's in general and, in particular, information concerning the
Olden Moore sighting of a UFO landing near Plumbers and Montville,
Ohio, Nov. 6, 1957, I am following General Ron's suggestion that
I again write your office. I do this reluctantly, as I have
found the ATIC reports advising me as "I've another deliberate "fast-
hoodwink" to those who ask factual questions concerning UFO's.

You have received MY reports on the case as well as many other reports.
You know that the DOT & CAD report has been released. You know
that the sighting was broadcast over television, radio, and the press.
You know that even Flying Saucers gave a fair report of the case in
the September text. Flying Wheels! It and the Seventh-Lane mystery. In
TOO, you know that dozens of government agents were on the landing
spot soon after the craft landed, as reported by Olden Moore.

I mention these facts as I do not wish to be embarrassed by Herr
Goebels-like statements that - you all know nothing about the Olden
Moore 51-sighting or, that the facts are too sketchy!

Specifically, how do you explain the foot or shoe prints and the
deep markings left by the craft and its occupants? More important,
what caused the craft to leave a high degree of radioactivity?

This latter and most important question is most important as a
right of mine (among others) lies to men physically suffering for a long
period of Tine after viewing a UFO at close range and for any civilian
to consider it worthy of Answer a matter of civilian defense and
I consider it a thing of serious consideration.

Your answer to these questions can help me and others to help
our fellow men whom may still believe that UFO's are harmlessly
or who are deluded by your and others propaganda that they do
not exist.

Dr. Carl O. Jung, famed psychologist has stated, "If it is true
that the AAF (American Air Force) withholds telling facts
then one can only say this is the most psychologically and stupid
policy one could invent..." The public ought to be told the
truth."

Sirs, UFO's have inflicted a path and ravage to many Americans
Some of the stain and damage could have been avoided had service
been given the truth concerning UFO's. You can give the Americans
this truth if you can once imagine on telling Americans alone
I again ask for a specific answer to the specific questions in
paragraph four: Are you once again to this area, you which "answer
specify the specific government office and the specific persons
responsible for keeping the UFO truths from a former free people?

Sincerely
Dan R. Hinkjer

Here is the text extracted from the document:

```
On 14, 15 and 16 January 1953, upon request of the Director of
Intelligence of the Air Force a Scientific Advisory Panel was established.

The general conclusions reached by the panel were that unidentified
flying objects:

a. Held no direct physical threat

b. Were not foreign developments capable of hostile acts to the U. S.

c. Were not unknown phenomena requiring the revision of current
scientific concepts.

The panel further concluded that unless deemphasized, UFO's did
constitute a threat to the orderly functioning of the protective units
of the body politic, because:

a. Unwarranted mass of irrelevant reports could clog vital
channels of communications.

b. Skillful hostile propagandists could induce national hysterical
behavior or harmful distrust of duly constituted authority.

c. Continued false reports might hide indications of a genuine
hostile action.

As a result, the panel made the following basic recommendations:

a. That immediate steps be taken to strip UFOs of the aura of
mystery which they had unfortunately acquired, to reassure
the public of the total lack of evidence of inimical forces
behind the phenomena.

b. That investigating and reporting personnel be trained to
recognize and reject false indications quickly and effectively.

indoctrination course outlining those factors of investigation peculiar
to UFO cases.

f. Analysis and Evaluation:

It was felt that in the past many cases were given an un-
scientific and "fast brush" treatment in an effort to get them filed.
It was decided that the approach should be more scientific and positive.
Until the analysis could be sure of his conclusions beyond doubt, then a
statement in the vein of the following should summarize his analysis:

"There is no evidence available to indicate that
the object sighted in this case was not a meteor" or
"In view of all the available evidence, the object of
this sighting was probably a meteor."

It was also suggested that a panel of qualified men, in
diversified fields be formed and used for consultation. The men on
this panel to be qualified in the following areas:

Sociology
Astronomy
Psychology
Physics
Public Relations

This panel to be used on an "on-call" basis, but to meet at least once
each month; at which time a summary of the months activities will be
presented to them. The purpose of this panel is to review some of the
more troublesome cases, spot trends in the program and make suggestions
as to the future outlook. The formation of this panel to be given further
consideration by the ATIC.

g. Re-evaluation of Old Cases:

Many UFO organizations have been constantly reopening the
more sensational of the old cases to the further embarrassment of the
Air Force. It was decided that the Aerial Phenomena Group, AFCIN/IN-EI&g,
would review these old cases, which in view of greater scientific know-
ledge and experience, may be removed from the "unknown" category and
reclassified as a "probable."

h. Claims of UFO Organizations:

In many instances the private UFO organizations, or their
sponsors, have made claims that some individual, usually a person with
in high esteem by the public, has made some statement sympathetic to
the views of the organization. It was decided that SAFTS-3 would write
letters to each person so quoted and ask for corroboration or denial,
and for further detail if in the affirmative.

AGENDA FOR UFO POLICY MEETING

1. Introduction.

   a. Purpose of meeting - to discuss the Air Force philosophy 
      toward and policy regarding the UFO Program, with an aim 
      toward correcting deficiencies.

   b. Statistics.

   c. Cost and manpower estimates for January 1959.

2. Areas of Interest.

   a. Public Relations.

      (1) Unidentified Flying Objects a misnomer, possibility of 
          using Unidentified Aerial Phenomena as official name.

      (2) Dr. Hynek's problem of adverse publicity.

      (3) Education of public - advantage taken of all favorable 
          publicity.

      (4) Rapid processing of information on reported cases to 
          prevent possible "snow-balling" at SAIFS.

3. Attacking the Problems.

   a. Reporting.

      (1) Speed.

      (2) Accuracy and completeness.

   b. Investigations.

      (1) Speed.

      (2) Completeness.

   c. Analysis and evaluation of reports.

   d. Suggested changes to AFR 200-2, dated 5 February 1958, and 
      change thereto.

   e. Re-evaluation of old cases catalogued as "unknown" when 
      bringing "Blue Book" up to date. The "unknown" cases, 
      especially the more sensational, are being exploited over 
      and over by organizations and individuals with some specific 
      axe to grind.

1. This regulation as it stands serves well the purpose for which it was written. However, the Air Force investigators are doing little more than meeting the minimum requirements of this document, and in many instances require prompting by the Air Technical Intelligence Center to deliver even this minimum data.

2. The shortcomings of the UFO investigation procedures probably are due mostly to the Air Bases assigning inexperienced and/or unqualified people to this task, and also to lack of interest in the Program. It is difficult to become fired up over a Program in which the boss shows little or no interest.

3. The ATIC proposes the following as a solution to the problems associated with UFO investigation.

   a. Assignment of competent persons as investigators.

   b. Short training program for the personnel proposed for use as investigators. The length of this training program should depend upon the basic qualifications of the personnel selected. However, it is suggested that such a training program not exceed twenty (20) hours. In all instances the program should include hours of instruction on the following:

      (1) History and philosophy of the UFO Program.

      (2) Introduction to Astronomy (Basic terminology and description of the more common astronomical bodies).

      (3) Methods of interrogation.

      (4) Use of equipment.

      (5) Reporting.
