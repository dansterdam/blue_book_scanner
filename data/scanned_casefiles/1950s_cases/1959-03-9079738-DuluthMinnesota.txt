AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Detachment 7, 1066th AISS
Snelling AFS, St Paul 11, Minn

REPORT NO: D7-UFOB-2-59     PART THREE     PAGE 7     OF 13     PAGES

I. SOURCE: 1st Lt. Owen L. Schwartz, AO 305806L, USAF
Address: 11th AIS, DULUTH Municipal Airport, Minnesota
Age: 25
Occupation: Pilot, USAF
Education: High School Graduate, SEAKS, Maryland
Qualifications: Pilot Indoctrination Course, Keesler, AFS, BILOXI, 
Mississippi; Primary Pilot Training, Tyndall AFS, Texas; Advance Pilot Training, Tyndall AFS, Texas; Advanced Pilot Training (2) years with approximately 700 hours jet time and 330 hours reciprocal time.

II. RELIABILITY: Source appeared to be of above average intelligence, and appeared to have had a very retentive memory. He was sincere, cooperative and friendly. All information was voluntarily submitted. One of Source's superior officers states that Source was a dependable and capable pilot. Source's information received is substantive and pertinent to the investigation on the sighting with other information received.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 14 March 1959, at 0215Z hours, 1st Lt. Owen L. Schwartz, AO 305306, and Captain Paul G. Mearns, F2L124, of the 11th Fighter Intercept Squadron, stationed at DULUTH Municipal Airport (KNDG 5052), Minnesota, took off in two (2) F-102A's from DULUTH for a practice intercept problem approximately seventy-five (75) North of DULUTH. Lt. Schwartz's aircraft was designated as COUSIN RED and Captain Mearns's as RED II FLIGHT took off at 140215Z time on a 360 degree heading utilizing the scramble control. RED I pilot stated that while he was climbing from angels 15 to 13 he was contacted by GALIAD 15 (F-59) controller and asked if he encountered any enemy or any targets on his scope at that altitude. At this time RED I noticed an AI (Air Intercept) contact on his scope at 12 o'clock, 16 miles. RED I further stated that he had the appearance of chart but that it could have been a ground return. He estimated the contact's position to be 27N, 93W. RED I then stated that he closed rapidly on the target at 320 knots indicated. Shortly thereafter at 120 degree heading by GALIAD 15 and told to search the area for any target. RED I then stated that RED I had GALIAD 15 discussed the situation and decided to continue on their practice intercept mission. GALIAD 15 had RED I and II break off and then set-up RED I and II on a practice intercept. GALIAD 15 (target ship) on a 120 degree heading and RED II on an intercept angle of seventy (70) degrees and RED I on an intercept angle of one hundred (100) degrees. At this point, RED I, flying IL, at about 20 miles; at the same time he noticed a bright light, flying, NE, and thought the light was a chaser. RED I stated that the bright light looked similar to an aircraft afterburner. RED I called RED II to tell him about the light. RED I stated the light pulsated from bright to dim and back to bright. RED I and ground control (red on top and green on the bottom). RED I stated that just prior to the completion of the practice intercept he called RED II and asked him if he had got on a 120 degree heading for the intercept and search for the unknown light. RED I stated the practice intercept occurred at ft. 38, 140215Z. RED II thought that RED II called him and said he had seen the same light, however, RED II thought that it was a ground light. RED I was at 20,138 and stated that the light was still very close with RED II.

RED I's altitude. RED I called GALLAND and described the light. GALLAND then asked
RED I and II to increase the bogey at all possible. RED I and II then put on
maximum power (Gts) on a 230 degree heading and saw the bogey at 0130 o'clock, southeast of DULUTH (Pt. 7). RED I, at a range of 20 miles, told GALLAND that he held to
.96 each because of fuel tank restriction. To keep the bogey on a 12 o'clock heading
RED I and GALLAND then broke a 300 degree turn. RED I stated that while in compass might have been maneuvering at this time. RED I stated that while he was
on the 300 degree heading he never gained on the bogey. GALLAND stated that whether he had contact with the bogey. RED I called GALLAND and said he had no
target on his radar set using 30 mile range scale). RED I then selected his
ground map radar and at a range of 12 miles (Pt. 4,5 and 6) RED I saw the bogey.
RED I described the slip as resembling the type of blip normally presented by an
aircraft. To further state his possibility could have been a ground target or return.
RED I chased the bogey for about 10 minutes and stated that he never gained on the
bogey. GALLAND advised RED I and II to chase a 340 degree heading that might
then be over the B-521's eight o'clock position and that the B-52 had painted a bogey
on his tail radar. RED I believed the callsign of the B-52 was either TOK 31 or
TOK CAT 34. GALLAND then vectored RED I on a 350 degree heading. On this heading
RED I started that they were over a bearing to a straight line from the lights of the range cities, at angles 32, and at his 9 o'clock position. RED II then
called RED I and said that he was on a 340 degree heading. B-52 was when he called
GALLAND, and that he seen the same light. Neither RED I nor II were able to close in
on the bogey so they decided to go home. On the way home RED I and II ran a course
of practice intercepts. During these practice intercepts, RED I experienced a short
period of electronic jamming. The warning was oversome by decreasing the transition
magneton button. RED I suspected the jamming to be electronic interference from
RED II's radar. GALLAND then called RED I and II and asked if they still could see
the bogey. Both pilots reported negative results. RED I then returned to his
original sighting position to see if he could again sight the bogey. He was unable
to sight the bogey at this time so he returned to his home base.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Detachment 7, 1006th AISS
Snelling AFS, ST Paul 11, Minn

REPORT NO. 
D7-UFO-3-59

PART FOUR
PAGE   9   of   13   PAGES

I. SOURCE: Captain Earl G. Weaver, 521524, USAF
Address: 11th FIS, DULUTH Municipal Airport, Minnesota

Age: 34 DOB: 5 September 1924

Occupation: Pilot, USAF

Education: High School Graduate - 1942

Qualifications: Cadet Flying School - 1945; Jet Transition School-1945; Intercept Beacons School (IMS); Total flying time - 5200 hours.

II. RELIABILITY: Captain Weaver was cooperative, amiable and sincere. He appeared of above average intelligence. The 11th FIS Operations Officer stated that the source was very reliable and dependable pilot. Source's information appears very pertinent. Source's information appears to substantiate other information on the sighting previously submitted. All information was submitted voluntarily.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 14 March 1959 at 0215z hours, Captain Earl G. Weaver, SN 521524 and 1st Lt. Owen L. Schwatka, AO 3053081, of the 11th FIS, stationed at DULUTH Municipal Airport, Minnesota (TWR 5052) were on an intercept problem approximately 75 miles north of DULUTH, Minnesota at 38 angles, 300° radial, .35 mach for RED II and .75 mach for RED I. Lt. Schwatka's aircraft was designated as RED II and Capt Weaver's as RED I.

RED I was the stimulated target and RED II the interceptor. RED I was on a 190° heading and RED II was on an approximate heading of 120°. After RED II completed its intercept, RED I noted a visual object to his right during the time that RED II was completing the intercept. RED I called GALAHAD ACW Site (FPC 4525) while aircraft was flying at 38 angles and reported an unknown object between 024552 C2502 hours. RED II overheard RED I query GALAHAD if he had anything in the area. GALAHAD directed RED I to search for the unknown object. RED II also started searching.

RED I aircraft turned directly to the target (unknown object) and reported a heading of 300° to GALAHAD. RED II turned aircraft right to a heading of 270° which put the object at 12 o'clock. RED II reported the object as a bright white light that would dim to somewhat of a reddish glow. The light appeared round in shape. Captain Weaver had experienced a similar light in the same position, elevation and azimuth wise during another flight on 1 March 1959 while flying from Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio to MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (FWA 3556) to DULUTH Municipal Airport, Minnesota. The sighting on this Wright-Patterson flight was first sighted at 34 angles and later at 300 knots and 300 feet, but never did close on the light. Prior to the time the pilot realized that he was not following his flight heading but rather some sort of a light instead.

According to the pilot the light varied from bright to dim. The weather on the Wright-Patterson to DULUTH Tactical Approach was clear from 1700 - 4000 feet, and it was a very dark night. The same conditions prevailed on the day of sighting. The pilot stated that the light was brighter than any plane or stars he had ever seen. The pilot followed the light at a normal cruising speed of .35 mach, 270° and 33 angles. The GCI Site at GALAHAD, DULUTH, Minnesota stated the pilot was calm, collected and flying a good tight light, but was not gaining on it. The pilot flew a 270° course for approximately 10 minutes. The pilot had no radar on this flight except the GCI radar. The pilot stated the light had no definite shape.

Noise on the scope. A B-52 on a 360° heading flying west of PHILLIPS, Minnesota, reported an unknown light on his port side (9100 o'clock position) which was GALLED then westward and RD II to the B-52 position to make a search for the object and then take a 0909 heading from that position. Then in B-52 turned to a 0430 heading they notified GALLAND that the unknown light was located now at their 9100 clock position. RED II PILOT then took a 270° heading and also observed the light at the 9100 clock position. RED II observed the unknown light in the return back to the simulated intercept mission. RED II observed the unknown light in the area relative position until the new moon observed. The unknown light was higher than the horizon. The pilots decided that he could not close on this unknown light so he ended the search.

PART SIX
PAGE    13    OF    13    PAGES

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that the unidentified visual sightings probably were the planet Venus.

a. According to the Air Almanac of 1959, the position of the planet Venus during the period of sighting indicates that Venus was located on a 300° heading, 15° above the horizon, and had a magnitude of -4.3. As this report indicates, the majority of the visual sightings were observed in a westerly direction and above the horizon.

b. On the basis of obtained information, it is believed that the electronic sightings should be evaluated as "Unknown" due to the absence of any reported aircraft in the sighting area which would have been conducting electronic or chief jamming.

Further checks are being made with the 23rd Bomb Wing, Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota to determine if there is any possibility whatsoever of an unreported 3G aircraft conducting unreported 304 operations in the area of the sighting at the time of sighting. Information will be forthcoming as obtained.

Attached report (D7-UFOB-2-59) is principally concerned with visual sightings of flashing colored lights. The apparent AR radar sightings reported by one F-102 pilot appear to be more like interference contacts than actual paint. Also, the other F-102 pilot did not obtain any radar contacts. Finally, neither the F-89 nor the ground radar reported any contact with the UFO. Hence, it is suggested that this report be evaluated on the basis of the visual sightings rather than the reported meager radar data.

DISPOSITION FORM

FILE NO. UFO #D7-UFOB-1-59 | UNCLASSIFIED

TO AFCIN-1824g | FROM AFCIN-421 | DATE 6 May 1959 | COMMENT NO.1
AFCIN-1218 (Capt. P. Keriakou)/Jo THEO/bldg 828/rm 241

The following information is forwarded based on an analysis of UFO #D7-UFOB-1-59:

a. It is difficult to accurately correlate the attached film with the report, without identification of the scope orientation, range setting and time indication (GMT or Extra). However, a review of the scope photographs at both time zones show no abnormal points or any indications to base an accurate analysis.

b. The reports of airborne contacts cannot be evaluated as actual airborne objects. The lack of visual sighting and the target fade as the interceptors approached the radar target.

c. APGC Operational Test Report, dated May 1958, on the AN/FPS-20A indicates that a peculiar phenomenon known as "angels" was experienced during the testing of this equipment. The "angels" appear as circular blips, some of which are very intense and others barely visible. Also, some remained fixed for certain periods then disappeared only to reappear in other areas, and some were seen to travel in various directions at random speeds. The cause of these "angels" was not determined during the test, although several theories were considered. Bendix Corporation is reported to be developing a network to eliminate this phenomenon, however no information is available.

d. Since the AN/FPS-6, height finder, was unable to pick up the targets at such a close range, it is believed that the phenomenon of "angels" could have been responsible for the UFO.

I. SOURCE:    2nd Lt. John Joseph Murphy, USAF

Address:    756th AROW Squadron, FINLAND (EKPO 4525), Minnesota

Age:    22, 23 June 1956

Occupation:    Director (Controller) at P-69 radar site and
               Intelligence Officer

Education:    Graduate of Lehigh University in June 1953 (Chemical
               Engineering, also studied Astronomy). OGI course at
               Lowry AFB, Florida

Qualifications:    Director for six (6) months at P-69 radar site

II. RELIABILITY:    Source was very friendly, cooperative, and sincere throughout
the entire interview. He appeared to be of above average intelligence and possessed
a working knowledge of the events that occurred on the night of sighting. He appeared to
have an excellent ability to orientate himself in conjunction with the events that
took place on the GEA/23 radar scope. He was capable of giving a graphic account of the
sighting. All information was voluntarily submitted. Pilots of the 1796th WS (ADC)
and the 11th FIS, DULUTH, Minnesota regard Lt. John J. Murphy as a highly qualified
and capable controller. The pilots stated to the interviewer that whenever they
go on practice intercept missions or rocket firing over Lake Superior, they have a
particular sense of security whenever Lt. Murphy is controlling them. Lt. Murphy's
capability was also substantiated by statement of the 756th AROW Squadron. Interviewer
extracted the following information pertaining to Lt. Murphy from the 756th AROW
Operations Status Board, from 1 January 1959 until 16 March 1959, Lt. Murphy had
controlled 353 AI's, 32 multiple AI's, 80 recoveries, 2 actual ID's and 80 successful
profiles.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:    2nd Lt. John J. Murphy, of the 756th
ACRDN, FINLAND (EKPO 4525), MINNESOTA, assigned as a controller and intelligence
officer, stated that he was controlling three (3) F-84G aircraft of the 179th
Fighter Intercept Squadron, Air National Guard, DULUTH (TWG 3052), MINNESOTA, on a
running intercept mission at 1300L12. Code name for this practice intercept mission
was SOCINT TILGRIM. SOCINT FLIGHT I was performing as target aircraft while SOCINT
FLIGHT II and III were intercept aircraft.    SOCINT FLIGHT I (target side) was on a
090 degrees heading, 500 plus the west of P-69 radar site (GAKADA), FINLAND,
MINNESOTA. SOCINT II and III at this time was flying side by side at 29 angles, on
a 150 degrees final attack heading, at 250 knots indicated. SOCINT II radar observer
called controller at P-69 and stated that he had two (2) targets on his scope, 30
degrees to the right and at fifteen (15) miles. At this time SOCINT II pilot called
a tally-ho on the target to the controller. Then SOCINT I flying at 220 knots on a
090 degrees heading, radioed P-69 controller that he had a tally-ho (visual sighting)
of two (2) contrails on his starboard side. The contrails were at 30 angles,
straight and level, with SOCINT I closely following. The P-69 controller then directed
SOCINT FLIGHT to break off intercept operation. Controller then set up SOCINT FLIGHT for a
3rd intercept pass. SOCINT I was on a 190 degrees heading at 30 angles. SOCINT II
and III were on a 090 heading. During the 3rd pass the P-69 controller observed on
his scope for the first time an unknown track. (Refer to Fig. 1, AF Form 112)
from P-69 site, twenty (20) nautical miles, heading 150 degrees with an approximate
200 knot ground speed. The Intercept Control Technician at P-69 site called AROW
SOCINT and KIOSIN and asked whether they were painting the unknown track. After the
3rd intercept pass was completed, P-69 controller vectored SOCINT II and III on a
100 degrees heading, SOCINT III then called to P-69 controller that he had a contact
on his scope at 12 o'clock, at 14 miles, with a high closure rate. A few minutes

later, 500TH III called F-69 controller that he had a JUDY with lock on target at
11 angles and closed to within two (2) miles. F-69 controller said at this time
500TH III, II and III were indicating 400 knots. 500TH III followed target for
four (4) minutes and then lost contact. F-69 controller then vectored 500TH I and
II on a 130 degree sweep pattern. 500TH II then called F-69 controller that he had
a scope contact at 25 angles, and closed from 14 to 3 miles from target. 500TH III's
contact then faded after approximately one (1) minute. F-69 controller stated that
500TH III had a total of three (3) previous and thus all his contacts faded.
Controller further stated that 500TH III had no visual contacts. Controller stated
that 500TH II had no radar contacts. (AO) with him on this 500TH I was nothing at
this time. Controller further stated that he did not paint anything on his SPA-23
scope. The F-69 controller then took action. (See Figure 1, P13) 500TH AISS leader then
called the F-69 controller told 500TH (AO) with him to return to base.

At 130140Z, F-69 controller called CHARLES (31st Air Division) to advise of the
situation and stated that he was going to scramble a hot bird. Also at this time the
F-69 Intercept Control Technician (ICT) called CHARLES WEATHER regarding weather
conditions. The ICT received a negative reply on message, showers, thunderstorms and
comets from CHARLES WEATHER.

F-69 controller stated that the scramble order was as follows:

a. Scramble one (1) hot bird (F-102A)
b. Vector Q40 degrees
c. Buster angels 20
d. Call GALAIRD on tom (10) when airborne

F-69 controller stated that COUSIN RED I (F-102A) of the 11th Fighter Intercept
Squadron, DULUTH, MINNESOTA, was airborne at 130145Z. RED I then flew according to
scramble order. RED I then called F-69 controller. Controller then told RED I to
steer a 090 degree course. Refer to Figure 1, an overlay of CPA-23 radar scope on
which controller plotted RED I's course and on which he identified the following
points:

FT. 1: Here controller vectored RED I on a 090 degree heading at 700 knots.

FT. 2: RED I at 25.5 angles had a contact on his scope 30 degrees to the right
at a distance of 25 miles. RED I stated that he had contact for about 12 seconds.
F-69 controller stated that RED I then called and said the target or object seemed
past him from right to left on about a 330 degree heading, at a high rate of speed.
RED I stated he had no contact. RED I then vectored F-69 controller to a 300
degree heading.

FT. 3: Here controller vectored RED I on a 210 degree heading.

FT. 4: Here RED I had contact on his scope 30 degrees to his port side, at 17
miles, and received AI electronic jamming on his X band. RED I reported that the
target was on a northerly heading on his port side.

FT. 5: F-69 controller had his 2nd scope contact with seven (7) unknown objects
in a "Y" formation, heading 020 degrees, at 250 knots ground speed. Thirty (30) miles
south of F-69, controller vectored RED I towards the objects seen on his GP-23 scope.
Controller stated he had no contact. RED I called base. I could make no intercation.

FT. 6: Controller then vectored RED I to the left on a heading of 300 degrees,

REF UFO SIGHTING OVER DULUTH, MINN AREA ON 14 MAR 59, THE FOLLOWING IS OUR ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF THIS INCIDENT: THE RADAR READINGS WERE MORE LIKELY DUE TO INTERFERENCE, PROBABLY FROM THE EXCESSIVE ACTIVITY OF AURORA BOREALIS, RATHER THAN AN ACTUAL PAINT. THE OBJECT SEEN VISUALLY WAS PROBABLY THE PLANET VENUS WHICH WAS A FEW DEGREES BELOW THE HORIZON AT A MAGNETIC BEARING OF APPROX 300 DEGREES, AND REFRACTION AND DIFFRACTION COULD BRING THE PLANET INTO VIEW AND DISTORTION AND DISTORTION BY THE ALTERNATE LAYERS OF AIR OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES COULD CREATE THE EFFECTS OF MOVEMENT AND CHANGE OF COLOR AND SHAPE.

THE FACT THAT THIS OBJECT MAINTAINED ITS SAME RELATIVE POSITION, AND THAT THE F-102's WERE UNABLE TO CLOSE ON IT, LENDS CREDENCE TO THIS CONCLUSION.

20 PAGES

I. SOURCE: A/2c James R. Ryzaka, AF 17435991, USAF
Address: 756th ACSW Squadron, INLAND (TWG 4525), Minnesota
Age: 20 DOB: 27 December 1938
Occupation: Intercept Control Technician (ICT) at F-89 radar site
Education: High School Graduate - Radar Operator's Course Keesler AFB, Biloxi, Mississippi
Qualifications: Radar Operator (AFSC 27733) from April 1957 until March 1959

II. RELIABILITY: Source was very friendly, cooperative, and sincere throughout this entire interview. He appeared to be of average intelligence. All information was voluntarily submitted. A/2c Ryzaka was assigned military duty as an Intercept Technician on the night of 12 March 1959 (CST) and was unable to give complete data as to events as they occurred. Airman Ryzaka was able to substantiate his statement by other members of the organization.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: A/2c James R. Ryzaka, AF 17435991, of the 756th ACSW Squadron, INLAND, Minnesota (PTC 4525) was on duty at the Duluth Airport as an Intercept Control Technician (ICT) for Second Lieutenant John J. Murphy, who was the Radar Controller. At approximately 0100 hours, 13 March 1959, two airmen (designated as 330TCH WINGS 1, II AND III) of the 179th FTS (ATC), DULUTH MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, MINNESOTA (GMDS 5052) were on a bumping mission within the INLAND, MINNESOTA area. 330TCH I was designated as the aircraft making a contact and 330TCH II and III were on the interceptors. While on the second set up 1823 FLIGHT Squadron call sign) 330TCH II and III were flying at a 3000 ft approximately 29,000 ft altitude, heading due north, when 330TCH I or II reported a contact dead ahead at 4 miles on the aircraft radar scope. Lt. Murphy, the Gallard Controller, vectored the 330TCH aircraft to climb 500 feet higher. This aircraft lost contact. 330TCH II reported through ground control. This cancelled the previous intercept for the second pass. A third intercept pass was set up and upon the approximate completion of the third pass, the Intercept Technician spotted 2 tracks NW of FINLAND, MINNESOTA ACSW Site, at approximately 3300 and 20-30 miles out. The two targets were observed tracking on a 210° heading on the scope by Lt. Murphy. These two targets were pointed out to A/2c Ryzaka, the ICT by the Controller. For an opinion on the targets, A/2c Ryzaka through personal observation stated that they looked like actual tracks because of the pilot's clarity. The ICT stated that if the blips were rather than they would have appeared hazy and fuzzy. The ICT then went on to the F2-46 radar scope to get an altitude reading of the targets. He scanned from 300° to 330° for approximately five minutes. The ICT made no pickup. He had no explanation as to why he could not get an altitude on the F2-46 scope. Airman Ryzaka stated the target on the GPA-23 scope had the size and glow of a small aircraft. Solid tracks were maintained on the scope for a duration of approximately ten sweeps. The target had a 210° heading. The ICT stated that the large aircraft would show up in size due to a large reflection on a large surface. The blip or point on the scope was smaller than the control vector. The Controller vectored 330TCH II and III (ANG F-94C Aircraft) to the site of the two unknown tracks. The Controller stated that he could track the two targets for approximately one half hour 330TCH II and III altered courses to various degrees and maintained 3000 ft. 330TCH I was approximately 3 nautical miles and received a contact and JUDY on the object at a distance of approximately 11-12 miles, and a heading of approximately 160°, altitude unknown. SFOGH II was unable to

Approximately 2-3 miles and then lost contact. There was no visual contact. All three SPORT flights (I, II and III) were put into search operation. All three aircraft claimed possible contact. All pilots could not identify the speed of the contact. The tally-hoe could not be identified as reciprocal or jet aircraft. All three SPORT aircraft were released at approximately 0132 to return to their home base. A/2C Pyzska then checked COMR Weather Station (DULUTH, MINNESOTA) and CLIMBS Weather Station (Slagle) Air Division) for meteorological data. The ICT received a negative reply on meteor showers, Groundsassistors and comets.

The Controller then scrambled one F-102 from Duluth Intercept Control, AFCS at approximately 0412. This aircraft was flown as COMR INT. The ICF heard the Groundcontroller's radio call at 0429 and 15,000 feet altitude. The ICT heard the pilot inform the Controller that he was heading in an easterly direction. The F-102 interceptor reported contact soon the radar scope at approximately 250 miles. The pilot claimed a contact (radar) that passed in front of his aircraft at a 3300 heading. The pilot had his contact on his scope from approximately 10 to 20 seconds. The pilot then reported that the contact faded after it crossed in front of his aircraft. The pilot then turned on intercept course. The ICT had no further information as was checking "other pertinent data". The ICT did state that the F-102 had another contact before returning to home base.

IV. MISCELLANEOUS: The ICT operator checked with SPORT II after landing his aircraft, if in his opinion there was an airborne object there? SPORT II replied: "Definitely yeah."

approximately 8-9 miles, but nothing beyond. This unidentified ship, however, was picked up at a distance of approximately 14 miles. The pilot had visual contact, which he described as a with 10 miles or a pro. A proximity 5 miles away, at an altitude of 10,000 feet and a true heading of approximately 250°. The pilot was flying at 20,000 feet and was normally 300 knots indicated. The pilot saw approximately 5 minutes before recognizing this light as a light on the northern area or Lake Superior at this time. He was at a distance of approximately 5,000 feet. There was no radar contact. 300TH II turned and took a 020° heading and climbed to 13,000 feet altitude.

The pilot of 300TH II observed a light below his aircraft at approximately 6,000 feet and a heading of 150°. There was no radar contact. The pilot called GALLARD and informed them. At this time the pilot became skeptical as to the validity of these observations, because after he reached 300TH II's altitude and heading, he positively identified the visual contact as being 300TCH I. 300TCH I was a high climbing turn which parted visual position identification. The pilot's aircraft was getting low on fuel so he notified GALLARD of the situation and headed for home airfield. While 300TCH I was on a heading toward his home airfield, the aircraft radio's audio faded to a point where the could not read outside transmission. The pilot's readability or outside transmission was also very weak. After approximately five (5) minutes, reception of outside transmission signals cleared at 21,000 feet altitude and hazy down to 18,000 feet altitude during this operation. No further information.

I.   SOURCE: 2nd Lt. John R. Arotta, AO 3066611, ARC
        Address: 179th FIS (ANG) DULUTH MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, MINNESOTA
        Age: 24     DOB: 7 January 1935
        Occupation: Civilian: Salesman; Military: Radar Observer
        Education: Graduate Central High School, 1953, DULUTH, MINNESOTA;
                   2 years University of Minnesota (Business Course) 1955
        Qualifications: 575 hours as radar observer. Graduate USAF
                         Navigator School and USAF Radar Observer School

II.  RELIABILITY: Source was very friendly, cooperative, sincere, and very
     talkative.    He appeared to be of above average intelligence. All information was
     voluntarily submitted. Captain Carr, Operations Officer of the 179th FIS (ANG)
     DULUTH MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, MN stated the Lt. Arotta was a capable and trust-
     worthy radar observer, and officer. Lt. Arotta's information appears to be reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 13 march, at approximately 0930Z hours,
     2nd Lt. John R. Arotta, AO 3066611, Radar Observer (RO) of the 179th Interceptor
     Squadron (ANG) stationed at DULUTH MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, (FNB 5052), MINNESOTA, took
     off in an F-94C aircraft (50070H FLIGHT ID) piloted by 2nd Lt. H. Chapman on a
     practice intercept mission with two other ANG F-94Cs and headed in a Northeast
     direction. When about 50 miles NE of DULUTH, 300TH II RO thought he saw a SOUTH
     II, and III. Take off time of 300TH FLIGHT was approximately 130030Z, climbed 360
     degrees to angels 30, 300TH II RO thought the speed of his aircraft was 300 knots
     indicated. Seven (7) miles north of DULUTH, GALLAND 15 controller told 300TH II
     and III to break away from 300TH I in order to set-up the practice intercept. After
     the first intercept was completed, 300TH II RO stated that while on the second
     Radar Observer picked up two (2) targets on his scope, altitude of targets level.
     RO stated that he had no idea of target heading. At this time RO stated that his
     radar was not working too officially. He stated that the target blips appeared to
     be larger than an F-94 blip and about one half mile apart. RO definitely stated that
     the unknown targets were sixty (60) to seventy (70) miles Northeast of DULUTH. He
     further stated that the two unknown targets were out of position to be considered the
     target ship 300TH I, and mentioned this to his pilot. 300TH II pilot then called
     GALLAND 15 controller and asked whether there were any claims in their area.
     GALLAND controller notified 300TH II pilot that he had no contact on his scope and
     that he had no flight plan and no way of knowing what 300TH II was talking about.
     This continued to run his second practice intercept. 300TH II then completed his
     second practice intercept. Shortly before starting his third practice intercept
     GALLAND 15 controller notified 300TH II pilot that he had a skin point on his GFA-23
     scope, 500 degrees from 300TH II, at about twenty (20) miles. GALLAND controller
     told 300TH II pilot to continue practice intercept, but upon completion of the
     third practice intercept, to run in ID (Identification) on the unknown target. Upon
     completion of the third practice intercept, 300TH II pilot was given a JOG heading
     made by GALLAND 15. On this heading pilot increased his speed to about 450 knots
     true air speed. While on this JOG heading, pilot had no contact with the target. Up
     on his scope at 14 miles, dead ahead, and low. 300TH II descended to angels 16
     and closed to nine (9) miles from the unknown target. The RO stated that the
     target faded after approximately two (2) minutes. 300TH II then called GALLAND and
     said that he had lost the target. GALLAND replied that the target was last seen on
     his scope at the same time. The RO stated that the target definitely was not a
     ground return. During the period of having the unknown target on his scope, RO
     mentioned to his pilot that he thought that he was getting jammed electronically.

REPORT NO. D7-UFO-3-L-59    PART FIVE
                            PAGE 12 OF 20 PAGES

(Interviewer's Note: When RO was queried on his electronic jamming experience, he recalled that last summer or last fall he had experienced electronic jamming while on a practice intercept of a "safcat" radar. He further stated that the jamming of the unknown target he had on his scope in this mission did not appear to be as bad as the jamming he encountered on the B-52 last summer or fall. Further questioning revealed that RO had experienced electronic jamming with F-94D practice intercept missions utilizing his same radar frequencies). GALLAND called RO at this time and again picked up the target on his scope, and then vectored 3000 ft on a 130 degree heading. While on the 130 degree heading called and said the unknown target was down nine (9) miles. At this time the RO reported to GALLAND that he picked up the target at nine (9) miles and stated 3000 ft. Shortly thereafter, down to angles 6 and then closed to within two (2) miles. At this time the unknown target faded from 3000 ft to a ground return. RO stated that he picked up other contacts but believed that these contacts were either 3000 ft or 111. Shortly thereafter, RO stated that his (Air/AGC 271) radio set lost its volume and could not be regulated. His receiver became very weak and barely audible. 3000 ft RO called GALLAND can his fuel was low and that he was returning to base.

IV. MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS OF RO: RO stated that while he was on this mission, the night was clear and that he could see the target. He further stated that the radios in F-94C aircraft of his squadron were very old.

I. SOURCE: Captain George H. Benlick, AO 3014222, ANG
Address: 179th FIS (ANG) DULUTH MUNICIPAL AIRPORT,
MINNESOTA

Age: 27 DOB: 10 July 1931

Occupation: Grad. School Teacher; Military: Radar Observer

Education: Graduate, Central High School, Superior, 
Wisconsin, 1949, BS Degree, Wisconsin State 
College, 1953, Post Graduate, 3 credits.

Qualifications: Total 540 hours including training in 
reciprocal and jet aircraft. Graduate 
Radar Observer School, Connally AFB, WACO, 
Texas and Ellington AFB, HOUSTON, Texas.

II. RELIABILITY: All information was voluntarily submitted. Source was 
very cooperative, amiable and frank. Captain Benlick rated as very depend-
able and trustworthy by his Fellow officers, as a Radar Observer. He was 
above average intelligence. Information appeared reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 13 March 1959, at approximately 
0930 hours, Captain George H. Benlick, AO 3014222, Radar Observer (RO) of 
the 179th FIS (ANG) stationed at DULUTH MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, MINNESOTA (CTNB 
5052) took off in an F-94Q aircraft. Piloted by 1st Lt. M. Dwight McQuade on a 
practice intercept mission with two other ANG F-94Gs and headed in a northeast 
direction. Captain Benlick was radar observer (RO) on THIS PLACE SORTH III 
aircraft which was similarly equipped. The two practice intercept SORTH III 
made two passes and the third was broken off. On the first and second 
pass Captain Benlick, the RO, observed two unidentified blips on his radar 
scope. The first sighting appeared approximately 45-55 miles NE of DULUTH, 
MINNESOTA. SORTH III was approximately 29,000 feet altitude and the aircraft 
speed was approximately 230 knots. The objects appeared on the scope from 
10-15 seconds at 450 to a tarboard at 16 miles. The objects were located 
approximately 4 miles from the simulated target. Captain Benlick, the RO, 
saw the simulated target plus the two (2) unidentified points on the scope. 
The pass was continued on the practice target. The two (2) unidentified 
points were also picked up at the FINAL MINNESOTA GOI altitude (SFC 4525) 
was overhead by the RO through the aircraft radio communications. The 
aircraft began searching for the unknown objects. The GOI relay headings 
(unrecalled by the RO) but no altitude were heard. A visual was sighted by 
1st Lt. McQuade, pilot of SORTH III, and the radar observer. This visual 
contact was identified as the simulated 3000FT target. After 3-4 minutes of 
searching the unknown object, a third radar contact was sighted approxi-
mately 12 miles, 55° port and approximately 15,000 feet, aircraft speed 
320-350 knots and moved ahead, heads toward DULUTH, MINN. SORTH III aircraft 
began to move toward port. The aircraft turned further port and brought the 
target to dead ahead and closed in on the unidentified blip to between 2-3 
miles, at aircraft speed of 320-350 knots, the overta was 3-50 knots. The 
close in was reported to the MTILDA GOI site. SORTH III aircraft was 
flying at 10,000 feet altitude when the target gave off that appears to be 
similar to chaff, but no chaff. It was much larger and not a sharp.

Captain Benlick stated that it was not of electric nature. It was at this 
time that the target was lost. The scope. The 3rd observation lasted 3-4

First at airtime prepared 45-55 miles NE of Duluth Minn. We were at 29,000 test. A/C was 220 R. Objects appeared on scope 650 to starboard at 15 miles. They were above A/C at 15,000 ft. First contact on the first two sightings. 3rd sighting was at 15,000 ft. Passed 1st A/C at 1/2 approx. 300 ft. moved both targets to steady when target was about 300 feet. It seemed to be moving to the port to steady when target was about 300 feet. We turned further port and moved target to dead ahead and closed with him to contact 2-3 miles. We went to 10,200 ft at a point than gave off what appeared to be chaff, but it was not clearly such. I now and not as sharp at this time target was at on groove. We had looks onto target at about 12 miles - it took look at 9 miles - hand control was used to follow target until time elapsed.

Qualifications: Rated USAF Pilot and Civilian Airline Co-Pilot

II. RELIABILITY: Source was friendly and seemed to be sincere. He was of very candid demeanor and gave two information willingly. Source had difficulty recalling the details of the sighting due to time lapse since sighting.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: 1st Lt. Dwight G. McQuade, pilot of an F-94C, was flying on a South Heading on a practice intercept of an F-84G at 30,000 feet (refer to Fig. A1, Pt. 16), near DULUTH, the GCI station, was trying to look on the target aircraft, which was traveling in an Easterly direction (refer to Fig. A1, Pt. 19), he passed through what seemed like a normal aircraft control (refer to Fig. A1, Pt. 72), which he assumed had been made by his target aircraft. The F-94/GCI was making contact approximately 15 miles from the target. Upon determining that the control hadn't been made by the target aircraft, GALLAND was contacted and GALLAND informed the "QAC that he made contact with a UFO.

Lt. McQuade's aircraft proceeded to search the area (refer to Fig. A1, Pt. 42). He dropped his altitude from 30,000 to 25,000 to 15,000 and at 11,000 feet going South the Radar Observer made a contact at 11 miles, 20 degrees of azimuth (refer to Fig. A1, Pt. 15). The aircraft closed to a distance to within two (2) miles with radar lock-on at an estimated speed of 400 knots. During this closing period the Radar Observer indicated he saw something in the area of the F-94. The pilot had no visual contact. At various times during the closing period the Radar Observer had as many as four contacts. At one time which he believed so brief that the Radar Observer had ground clutter on his radar during time of lock-on. The aircraft was located on the TRD approximately two (2) minutes after the lock-on was broken, either intentionally or unintentionally (refer to Fig. A1, Pt. 77). The aircraft pursued the UFO (or approximately two (2) minutes after the lock-on was broken before returning to DULUTH (refer to Fig. A1, Pt. 33) because of lack of fuel.

successful. F-69 gave a general run down of the situation. P-69 also briefed
the pilot about the unknown and contrails supposedly seen by SCOTCH FLIGHTS
I, II and III. RED 1 encountered poor visibility near GALAHAD. The ground
lights were very obscure (RED 1 pilot was well acquainted with this area).
F-69 then informed RED 1 to search the area. RED 1 received obscure contacts
on his radar scope. RED 1 then climbed to an altitude so as to point
the unknown on his scope. RED 1 had contacts on his scope. RED 1 located
on the contact for approximately 7 seconds, and approximately 15 miles.
RED 1 closed on the unknown and had a greater vertical speed than his true air
speed of 500 knots. RED 1 encountered jarring of an electronic nature and the
lock broke. The pilot addressed the anti-jam switch and locked on again and
lost lock after approximately three (3) seconds. These unknown were
approximately 30° right at 25,000 feet altitude. The area contacted was then
crossed. RED 1's radar scope off the left side at close range (within 4 miles).
RED 1 then made a stop 100° turn to the left. RED 1 continued the search
mission. RED 1 could not recall the vector. Lt. Cox then pointed a target
approximately 100° at his port side, and at approximately the same altitude.
RED 1 estimated that the contacts were on the aircraft radar scope for approximately 15 seconds. Lt. Cox stated that it was definitely an airborne return.

RED I stated that the contact faded off his radar scope gradually. F-89 then controlled the pilot of RED I on another search mission, but the pilot could not recall the heading. No interception was made.

While the pilot was returning to his home base, two pilots thought he had observed a visual at a approved 1,100 close position at his approach level of the aircraft, which was 25 angles. The pilot relayed this information to F-89. The pilot stated that the visual contact appeared to be a blinking light. There was no contact on the aircraft radar scope. RED I thought he was running a light. The cockpit was then a place. The lights appeared to be white, green and red and were flashing intermittently. Lt. Cox, the pilot, turned on the cockpit lights so a determination could be made of the unknown light. RED I gave no opinion as to the nature of the light. It was a very dark night.

46. Please give a brief narrative account of sighting and any other additional data or comments.

I had two radar contacts. The first was at around 200 right hole to the ground altitude. Low-on was able to hover, maintain altitude, and look could not maintain.

The document appears to be a "SURFACE WEATHER OBSERVATIONS" form. At the top of the document, there is a partially legible header. The form is a detailed grid with multiple columns for recording various meteorological data. Due to the image quality and handwritten nature of the entries, many specific details are difficult to read precisely. The form seems to be from a weather station, with rows of data entries recording various atmospheric and weather-related measurements at different times.

The top left of the document has a notation "(Rev. 10-55)" and the word "STATION" is visible, though the specific station name is not clearly legible in this image.

The columns appear to include fields for time, weather conditions, wind direction and speed, temperature, and other meteorological observations, but the exact details are hard to discern due to the image quality.

At the bottom of the page, there are some handwritten notes and a stamp or notation "DI-UFOB-1-59" which seems to be a file or reference number.

The text is somewhat difficult to read in parts due to the image quality, but the general structure of the weather observation form is clear.

Due to the image quality and complexity of the document, much of the text is difficult to read clearly. However, I can make out some partial text and numbers:

At the bottom of the page, I can see "8-4-59" which appears to be a date.

In the "Synoptic Observations" section, there are various numbers, grid markings, and some X symbols.

The document appears to be a detailed meteorological or scientific observation log with multiple grid sections, columns of numbers, and various annotations.

Most of the specific text and numbers are too blurry or small to confidently transcribe without potential errors.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

In the opinion of the preparing Officer there were a number of radar contacts made during this period of the sighting which may or may not be related to each other.

On the basis of obtained information, it is believed that these electronic sightings should be evaluated as "abnormal" due to the absence of any reported aircraft in the sighting area at the time of sighting which could have contributed electronic or other jamming operations.

There is a remote possibility that the radar equipment in the F-94's malfunctioned during some of the sightings due to old and worn-out equipment. This factor cannot, however, account for all of the electronic sightings.

Further checks are being made with 28th Bomb Wing, Ellsworth AFB to determine if there is any possibility that 340 aircraft were conducting unreported Air Operations in the area of the sighting at the time of sighting. Information will be forthcoming as obtained.

Regarding visual sightings of contrails in the sighting area, these sightings may have been caused by contrails from SCOTCH FLIGHT aircraft (Lt. Lequois reported that SCOTCH aircraft were producing contrails).

tail light 80 degrees on each side. The lights also cover approxi-
mately 60 degrees in the vertical plane, 30 degrees up and 30 degrees
down. An F-94 Greely of Otinaa Lighting Company had a Boeing
Aircraft Company had one such system for installation on a "707", and
that the Federal Aviation Agency has a C-131 at Atlantic City, N. J.
and one system for installation on a C-130. Mr. Greely pointed out
that neither of these systems was as yet installed.

2. Fire Control System installed in the F-102A is the MG-10.
The maximum search range of the radar is 50 miles under ideal condi-
tions, the maximum range for lock-on is 20 miles.

3. Unusual aurora activity in the area at the time of the
sightings.

4. Weather clear, crisp and cold, with visibility 15 1/2 miles.

5. Shape, color, size and other characteristics of object as
reported.

6. Position of major stars and prominent planets at time of
the sighting.

D. Analysis

1. AFOIN-AEl concludes that in all probability the radar
readings were more likely due to interference than an actual paint
(AF Subject 1R (F/R-025-59) dated 21 April 1959 from AFOIN-AEl to
AFOIN-AElg)

2. The planet Venus was a few degrees below the horizon at a
magnitude bearing of approximately 200 degrees. Refraction could
bring the planet into view and distortion and diffusion caused by the
various temperature layers could be responsible for the various shapes,
colors and apparent motions.

E. Conclusions

1. The radar readings were due to interferences and not the
existence of a real target. These interferences were probably due
to excessive activity of the northern lights (aurora).

2. The object seen visually by the crews of the aircraft was
probably the planet Venus, brought into view by diffraction and dis-
tortion by the alternate layers of air of different temperatures to
create the effects of movement and change of color and shape. The
fact that this object maintained its same relative position, and
that the F-102's were unable to close on it substantiates this
conclusion.

41. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to describe that you could construct the object you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

THE SIGHTING WAS AT NIGHT SO I SAW ONLY LIGHTS. TO RECONSTRUCT IT I WOULD USE A STATIONARY AIRPORT. WHITE BEACON WITH A SMALLER IRREGULAR FLASHING, RED AND GREEN LIGHT PLACED JUST IN FRONT OF THE BEACON.

42. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this?
(Circle one) [x] No   If you answered no, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?

43. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?

IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PLANET BUT I KNOW OF NO WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FLASHING RED + GREEN LIGHTS.

UFO SIGHTING, DULUTH, MINNESOTA
13 March 1959

On 13 March 1959, at 0820%, and on 14 March at 0820%, an unidentified flying object was sighted from the Duluth, Minnesota area. The object was reported to have been observed both visually and on radar by military personnel from both aerial and ground vintage point. The color of the object, as reported by the witnesses, was red, orange, green or white. The shape was round, and it was reported as having a speed that allowed it to keep pace with the aircraft. All witnesses agreed that the object maneuvered in a magnetic heading of approximately 300° and disappeared by fading from sight.

Two of the airborne witnesses were pilots of F-102 interceptors. These pilots attempted an intercept but were never able to close on the object.

The radar targets were reported to have been both sharp and fuzzy contacts. Some operators indicated that the contact was broken by the object falling and contacts suddenly rushed away at speeds too fast for aircraft. The radar observers reported that they looked on during the period for short periods (ten seconds to one minute) several times. Radar film from the ground stations was forwarded to FTD and analyzed as the phenomenon known as "Angels".

The sighting period, for both the radar and visual sightings, was reported to have lasted 30 minutes. No sightings were reported to have lasted continuously for the entire 30 minutes.

The weather during the period was reported as clear, visibility 15%, and the temperatures ranged from a high of 35°F to a low of 27°F. Winds were light.

The visual sightings were due to the misidentification of the planet Venus. The azimuth of the planet at the time of the sighting coincided with that reported for the UFO. Atmospheric refraction of the planet was a contributing factor.

1. Here are two similar visual sightings from the ATIC files. I have been unable to locate the Caribbean sighting which you mentioned in your letter of 17 February, but I will forward it when the information is found. If you have a date for this sighting it would help, if the location file is to be used.

2. The ATIC file does not contain any information on the Fred M. Johnson sighting referenced to in his letter of 29 January.

3. Sorry to have taken so long, but we are in limited operation due to being relocated.

4. I am glad to hear of the progress which you and Mrs Boyd are making with the book. I certainly wish you the best of luck and look forward to reading it. My sincere regards to Mrs Boyd.

Venus as an Event

In the spring of 1959 Venus again, this time in the evening, caused reports of flying saucers. At 6:20 P.M. on March 13, a clear evening with visibility of about fifteen miles, an unidentified flying object was sighted in the western sky near Duluth, Minnesota [2]. Witnesses described its shape as tubular or round and its color as red, orange, green, or white. Two interceptors of the Air Defense Command were scrambled to investigate and eventually gave up the chase and landed. Military personnel at ground stations and in the air observed the object visually and picked up radar returns; it disappeared, after about thirty minutes, by fading from sight. Although this spectacular unknown had seemed to keep pace with the aircraft, at times running toward and at other times reversing direction and racing away, all witnesses agreed that the object had remained at a magnetic bearing of approximately 360 degrees.

The radar screen at the ground station had been photographed and the film was forwarded to ATIC at Dayton. Analysis showed that the echoes had not come from a real target but were "angels" caused by interference (see Chapter VIII). Some operators reported the target faded suddenly, on others it rushed off the scope at incredible speeds. Contact was intermittent, for short periods of from ten seconds to a minute, and each new contact gave a different position for the target.

At the time of the sighting Venus was just on the western horizon, at the same position occupied by the unknown, and probably would have been invisible except for the refraction by the earth's atmosphere. Layers of air with different temperatures had produced the apparent motion and changes in color. The object had maintained the same size and relative position during the entire period of observation; it disappeared by fading from sight, sinking farther below the horizon. The following night, under similar atmospheric conditions, the object reappeared in the same position. The unknown was positively identified as Venus.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

[Left margin note appears to read: "Project 10073 Record Copy"]

It was on the night of March 19, 1952, and the
officers of the Air Defense Command were alert to
the Duluth Municipal Airport area. They shuffled along close
to the long, paved and gravel clearing that was now bare
and cold.

As 5:20 P.M., exactly, the question officer, note the in-
cident came in over the cold line that I came had sighted an
unidentified object off to the north. What else came
down was a people's rumble out of balance to feel that
something was stirring, dimly outside.

And then, its very life, sound and bright, and it was moving
at high speed. Some observers, though it was "crawling" slowly.
Conditions, but it was some something and it was there.

The bearing was 300 degrees from the base.

It was an awesome night and it became even more intense.
A quick call to an adjacent radar site brought back the reply
that they had just picked up a target on a bearing of 340 degrees.

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

I. SOURCE: 2nd Lt. John Joseph Murphy, USAF

Address: 756th ACEW Squadron, FINLAND (PKG 4525), Minnesota

Age: 22 DOB: 23 June 1936

Occupation: Director (Controller) at P-69 radar site and Intelligence Officer

Education: Graduate of Lehigh University in June 1958
(Chaired engineering, also studied Astronomy)
GCI Course at Tyndall AFB, Florida.

Qualifications: Director for six (6) months at P-69 radar site.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was very friendly, cooperative, and sincere throughout the entire interview. He appeared to be of above average intelligence and possessed high retention of the events that occurred on the night of sighting. He appeared to have an excellent ability to correlate himself in conjunction with the events that took place on the GPI/23 radar scope that he was operating on the night of the sighting. All information was voluntarily submitted. Pilots of the 1790th FIS (ANG) and the 11th FIS, DULUTH, unanimously regard Lt. John J. Murphy as a highly qualified and capable controller. The pilots stated to the interviewers that whenever they go on particular intercept missions or rocket firing cover Lake Superior, they have a particular sense of security whenever Lt. Murphy is controlling them. Lt. Murphy is capably was a 756th ACEW Squadron Interceptor Controller. Interviews extracted the following information pertaining to Lt. Murphy from the 756th ACGW Operations Status Board. From 1 January 1959 until 16 March 1959, Lt. Murphy had controlled 353 All's, 32 multiple All's, 20 scrambles, 20 total intercepts.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Lt. John J. Murphy, of the 756th ACEW Squadron, FINLAND (PKG 4525), Minnesota, assigned as controller (GALAHAD 15) and Intelligence Officer attached to the 11th Fighter Intercept Squadron, DULUTH (CENS 5052), Minnesota, on a practice intercept mission, at approximately 140220 March 1959. Code name for this practice intercept mission was COUSIN RED FALCON consisting of two (2) F-102A aircraft. Controller stated that COUSIN RED I and II took off from DULUTH Municipal Airport at approximately 021520, heading 360 degrees, and were climbing to angels 40. P-69 (GALAHAD 15) controller stated that RED II (COUSIN II) said he was somewhere in the vicinity of FINLAND when he was about ten (10) miles north of DULUTH. Controller told both RED I and RED II to turn on their radar and search 30 degrees to the right. RED I then contacted the controller and said he had a contact on his scope at angels 21, sixty (60) degrees. RED I told the controller that the radar scope looked like a return off a B-52 aircraft. RED I was then directed by the controller to follow the contact. RED I then told the controller that he had passed right through the contact. Controller then called RED II who at this time was five (5) miles behind RED I and said if RED II was on contact. RED II notified the controller that he had negative contact. GALAHAD 15 then stated that RED I and II were on their own and were picking bumper heads in the vicinity. While on their bumper heads they were being controlled by the controller. At 0240Z GALAHAD 15 was call on to the GP/23 scope by Lt. Murphy. Lt. Murphy then stated that RED I was on a heading of 090 degrees and was attempting to intercept RED I flying on a 150 degree heading. Controller stated that when

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

I. SOURCE: A/2C James R. Pyzska, AF 17485091, USAF
Address: 756th ACSW Squadron, MTRADS (MTOE 4525), Minnesota
Age: 20 20th 27 December 1959
Occupation: Intercept Control Technician (ICT at P-60 radar site).

Education: High School Graduate - Radar Operator's Course, Keesler, AFB, Miss.

Qualifications: Radar Operator (AFSC 27332) from April 1957 until March 1959.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was very friendly, cooperative, and sincere throughout the entire interview. All information was voluntarily submitted.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: A/2C James R. Pyzska, AF 17485091, of the 756th ACSW Squadron, FIFLAND, Minnesota was on duty as Radar Operator as an Intercept Control Technician (ICT) for 2nd Lt. John J. Murphy, who was the Control Operator. At approximately 0200 hours, on 14 March 1959, two F-102 aircraft (Designated as CLEAN RED I and COUSIN RED II) of the 11th FIS, DULUTH, Minnesota ANG, were vectored to intercept an unknown object which A/2C I made an unknown contact at the 12 o'clock position on a 350° heading at a distance of approximately 10 miles while climbing to the "ceiling" altitude. RED I thought it was chaff. The pilot reported the contact as very hazy and fuzzy. At 1 mile, could not distinguish the object. At the second pass of the practice intercept while on a 180° heading, 75 miles, 37,000 feet altitude, he was observing RED II coming up behind at 1200 or 1300 knots, when he noticed a bright white light behind RED II. After the intercept both aircraft observed a bright white light rotating by beam with a flashing red and flashing green bottom in the DULUTH, Minnesota area.

PART TWO
PAGE 6

OF 13 PAGES

33 by approximately 20-30 minutes noticed M/C CAT 33 that he had also observed an unknown light at approximately the same position as observed by M/C CAT 33. Approximately one-half hour after the F-102s and B-52 were left the area, the 9th Air Division, Snelling AFB, St Paul, Minnesota (RING 356) scrambled me (L) F-89 from Duluth, North Dakota (KGTX 1293) on a 900 heading for investigating the area where the unknown light was last observed. When the F-89 headed his aircraft towards the northern lights he had a 1 1/2 radar interference. Then the F-89 pilot burned away from the northern lights less interference was noted on the radar scope.

IV. MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION: The ICT stated that MED I and II had visual contact via two moon and northern lights at all times. MED I and MED II pilots were checked by GLAFIAD for any signs of ear buzzing, headaches, drowsiness, correct cabin pressures, aircraft vibrations, etc. during the time of sighting so as to eliminate any physical possibilities of delusions. Pilots reported no deficiencies.
