Dear Sirs

I have just finished reading the book "Flying Saucers". on page 298 it gives a report on the UFO's.

about 2 years ago me and my friends spotted a UFO 2 miles west of new Holstein, Wisconsin. I spotted it for about 3/4 hour - changing color from blue to red. and the time was 21:30. I called the county police (calumet) but they did not nothing about it. I then called true field in madison, wise. But then was to late for them to spot the U.F.O. There is also a report on it in the new Holstein report on the U.F.O.

could you let me know just what it was and write. Thank you for your kind help and coertion.

I am now in the U. S. navy in the med. my address is.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFOIN-1E46

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting                                                                 6 NOV 1957

TO: SAFIS-3d (Major L. J. Tacker)

1. The UFO sighting reported by [redacted] is two years old, too old to be of any value. There apparently was nothing unusual about the alleged object for Mr. [redacted]. He is two years to report it. It is apparent he is influenced by the books he reads on the subject, and decided to write to the Air Force out of curiosity.

2. The Air Force did receive a report from Wisconsin in September 1957, and it was concluded to be the aurora borealis which was seen from several states.

10 November 1959

Dear Mr [redacted]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 November 1959 concerning Unidentified Flying Objects.

The report you submitted is too old to evaluate. However, the Air Force did receive a report from Wisconsin in September 1957 and it was concluded to be the aurora borealis which was seen from several areas. This is probably what you observed.

For your information I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense release on UFO which clearly states the Air Force position on this subject.

Sincerely,
