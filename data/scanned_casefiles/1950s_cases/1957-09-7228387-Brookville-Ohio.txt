REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFOIN-4E46
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting
TO: SAFIS-3d (Major L. J. Tucker)
1. The UFO sighting reported by Mrs. Anna Rodis currently was nothing unusual about the sighting. The incident was reported to be seen from several homes in the area, and does not appear to be an important sighting. It is apparent that she is influenced by the books she reads on the subject, and decided to write to the Air Force about this sighting.
2. The Air Force did receive a report from Wisconsin in September 1957, and it was concluded to be the aurora borealis, which was seen from several locations.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book, which was the official project for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text output from the document:

10 November 1959

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 November 1959 concerning Unidentified Flying Objects.

The report you submitted is too old to evaluate. However, the Air Force did receive a report from Wisconsin in September 1957 regarding a sighting which was similar to what you observed. This is probably what you observed.

For your information I am including the latest Department of Defense release on UFOs which clearly states the Air Force position on this subject.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
