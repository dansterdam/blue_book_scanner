Dear Gentlemen:

On Saturday, December 19, I was walking in the country near Burgoon, Ohio, with another girl. It was 5:15 p.m. and the temperature was approximately freezing. 

We saw a shiny metallic object that at first we thought to be a jet making a vapor trail. We didn't think much of it until we looked at it again. It was now coming straight down, and the trail was moving with it. As it came straight down, it took the shape of a saucer. This saucer-shaped object did not have a vertical rotation, but was somewhat tilted.

After some time the object hovered in mid-air. We thought at first that it could be a plane of some sort, but then a plane flew by, and the object was much smaller and in a different direction than the plane was going.

I cannot describe the color of this object, except that it was very brilliant and we thought that it might have been some sort of a drilling rig.

Since the rest of my family thinks that I am nuts, and I would like to know what I was looking at, I thought you might be able to explain it to me.

Yours very truly,
