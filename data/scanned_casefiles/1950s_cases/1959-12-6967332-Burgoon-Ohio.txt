Upper Sandusky, Ohio
December 22, 1959

Wright Patterson A.F.B.
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Gentlemen:

On Saturday, December 19, I was walking in the country near Burgoon, Ohio, with another girl. It was 5:15 P.M., the sun was setting, and the temperature was approximately freezing.

We saw in a northwest direction what at first we thought to be a jet hiking a vapor trail. We didn't think much of it until we looked at it again. It was now coming straight down, and the trail was moving with it. As it came down, the trail seemed to disappear and the object took the shape of a ball. As it came still further down, it took the shape of a saucer. This saucer shaped thing actually looked as if it were spinning and it did not have a vertical rotation, but was somewhat tilted.

After some time, the saucer stopped its decent and hovered in mid air. We thought at first that it could be a plane of some sort, but then a plane flew by in front of the object. The sun did not shine on this plane so as to make it bright as was the object.

Before the plane flew by, however; the saucer got smaller and when the plane flew by, the saucer seemed to rotate in the same direction that the plane was going, and then disappeared altogether.

I cannot describe the color of this object, except that it was very bright and we thought that it might have been a comet or a falling star.

Since the rest of my family thinks that I am nuts, and I would like to know what I was looking at, I thought you might be able to explain it to me.

Yours very truly,

[Signature redacted]
