NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
SOURCE: DRE "World of Flying Saucers"

31 October 1955
Florida (Gainsville)

A flight of bombers refueling in mid-air at night can be a startling spectacle and more than once has been reported as a gathering of flying saucers.

Such an incident occurred in Florida on October 31, 1955, when a disk jockey at Gainesville broke into his radio program about ten o'clock in the evening to announce that flying saucers were over the station. Many of his listeners hurried out of their houses to look at the Halloween visitors, clearly visible in the night sky. One reporter stated that he had seen four to six objects, oblong in shape, brilliantly glowing, red and orange, traveling soundlessly in a straight-line formation that later changed to a V [8]. Both the radio station and the police station were swamped with telephone calls from frightened citizens, most of whom calmed down when they learned the explanation: a flight of bombers had been refueling at an altitude of 23,000 feet.

Qualifications: Unknown

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE gave much thought to each question asked and seemed fairly sure of his answers. In the opinion of the investigator, SOURCE was fairly reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

SOURCE'S Statement: "I first sighted the objects while making a round of police duties Sunday night, 30 Oct 55, at 10:00 PM EST. They appeared to be bright round lights, about 12 inches in diameter. I then drove several miles out of Williston, stopped my car, and got out to scan the skies. At approximately 10:15 PM EST, one of the lights appeared to descend to within 150 feet of my car and as the time the light was so intense that it was blinding. Then suddenly it disappeared leaving no trace of anything in the bright moonlight. Monday at 9:00 PM EST, I sighted three more bright lights in the sky at approximately 9:00 PM EST. They appeared not to be over two hundred feet above the earth and as they came over; the area lit up instantaneously enough to make a meadow on the gravel road. They seemed to hover over levy county until about 9:17 PM EST. Then I saw nine bomber type aircraft in vee formation at about 7,000 feet with a passenger type aircraft traveling about 3,000 feet above these aircraft. At no time was any sound or vapor trails observed.

Additional Information: SOURCE was certain that he viewed the objects for 45 minutes at 21/1030 Oct 55 and for 5 minutes at 01/0200 Nov 55 in bright moonlight with a few star shining. The objects were brighter than the sky background and bright enough to hurt eyes at one time. Objects did not alter color or shape, flicker, throb, or pulsate, however they did appear to stand still, initially speed up and rush away at times. The objects appeared to be solid and at no time did they move in front or behind another object. At no time did they give off smoke and the only color was like that of a bright light. SOURCE was looking to the South when sighting objects and to the Southwest when they disappeared. SOURCE estimated the objects were about 15 degrees above horizon. Atmospheric conditions were as follows: Clear sky, slight breeze, dry and warm. SOURCE estimated that the speed of the objects was greater than that of jet type aircraft."

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE gave much thought to each question asked and seemed sure of his answers. In the opinion of the investigator, it would be difficult to find a more reliable SOURCE.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

SOURCE'S Statement: "The first time I saw them, they were coming from the South, going Northwest with no particular formation. Some were lighter in color than the others. There were six, one behind the other and they resembled a bright star. The objects made four or five passes over the field (Taylor Field) but were not close enough to tell their shape. They seemed to get lighter upon acceleration and the lights would cut out completely at times and then come on again. Finally the objects moved off into the distance."

Additional Information: SOURCE was fairly certain that he viewed the objects for a period of one hour at approximately 31/0200 Oct 55 in bright moonlight with many stars visible. The objects were bright to her, broke ground and they looked like big light bulbs. The objects did not appear to stand still at anytime, break into parts, explode, give off smoke, change shape, flicker, throb, or pulsate, however they appeared to suddenly speed up and rush away at times. At no time did the objects move in front or behind another object. Objects were observed at times through eye glasses and the car windshield. At no time was any sound heard and only color was like that of a bright light. SOURCE was fairly certain that a time held was approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes. When objects first appeared, they were 220 degrees from true North and 15 degrees above the horizon. When objects disappeared, they were 320 degrees from true North and 15 degrees above the horizon. Weather conditions at the time were as follows: Clear sky, dry, no wind, and cool.

SOURCE estimated that the speed of the objects was in the 700 MPH range.

difficult to find a more reliable SOURCE.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

SOURCE'S Statement: "Upon hearing talk over police radio I proceeded to
location of the other cars. First observing six specks of light preceding in a
straight line above Western Horizon. Objects seemed to make left turns Southwest of
here and then proceeded North again at a slight angle. With a few
minutes they would all six reappear from the Northeast Horizon again. They followed
this same pattern two or three times. Then approximately an hour later I observed
one group of the same objects come from the North Horizon and go straight across at
approximately 9:00 PM EST 30 Oct 1955 and continued on their way. At this time
view for a period of one hour but was not very sure of the time element. Object
was brighter than the sky background and many stars were visible. He does not
remember about the weather. The brightness was like that of a bright automobile
headlight several blocks away. Object appeared to move behind a group of trees as
it went out of sight over Horizon. Object was very bright. At no time did the
object appear to move in front of something. Object made no sound and was the color
of white or off-white. The edges of the object were like that of a bright star and
only one being sharply outlined. SOURCE was fairly certain that a man held at arms
length would cover the object but stated that he could not see all of the object
as rear was unlighted. SOURCE was on routine patrol and heard other cars talking
over the radio about the sighting, so he proceeded out to the airport (Taylor Field)
where above observation was made. Weather conditions were as follows: Clear sky, dry,
slight breeze and cool. SOURCE stated that if the object was a "Flying Saucer",
he had no idea as to what could have caused it.
