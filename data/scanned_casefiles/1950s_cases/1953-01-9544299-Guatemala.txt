UNCLASSIFIED

On 9 January 1953, the writer interviewed a US Air Force Captain who stated he was an eyewitness to an unusual aerial object observed in Guatemala on 10 December 1952. The object was first sighted at approximately 1845 hours local time, at an estimated altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet, and was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes.

According to the Captain's statement, the object was circular in shape, metallic in appearance, and did not emit any exhaust or contrails. Its movements were described as rapid and erratic, with sudden changes in direction and speed. At times, the object appeared to hover momentarily. No sound was heard associated with the object.

The Captain further stated that two other US Air Force officers also observed the object, as well as several Guatemalan civilians. He indicated that the incident had been reported to US military authorities. The writer was informed that similar aerial phenomena had been observed on other occasions in the Guatemala area.

The writer has no additional details regarding this incident. This report is forwarded for your information. It is requested that the identity of the US Air Force Captain not be divulged.

The text in the document states that the object observed was black in color and approximately twice the size of a normal airplane. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and had a brilliant trail of light behind it. The observer reported that the object appeared to be accelerating and seemed to be under intelligent control. The report also mentions that the object's movements were erratic, suggesting it was not a conventional aircraft. Overall, the document appears to be an eyewitness account of a UFO sighting.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

I have been asked to examine certain photographs taken of a purported "flying saucer" near Guatemala City on December 9, 1952.

The photographs in question were taken by a citizen of Guatemala who wishes to remain anonymous. In view of the confidential nature of this case, I shall refrain from revealing his name.

My examination of the photographs leads me to conclude that they are not the result of a photographic trick or hoax. The images depicted are clearly not man-made aircraft of any kind known to me. However, I cannot state with certainty that they represent an extraterrestrial vehicle. More information would be needed to make a definitive judgment.

I hope this preliminary analysis is of some use to you in your investigations of this intriguing case. Please let me know if you require any further information from me.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

Entomologist
