The image appears to be a black and white photograph of dense vegetation or brush, with numerous intertwining branches, twigs, and leaves creating a complex, tangled pattern. The image is quite grainy and high-contrast, making the details of the vegetation look almost like a web or network of white lines against a darker background. No text is visible in this image.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

1. On 14 September 1959, the Lexington Field Office, Lexington, Kentucky, Region V, 109th CIC Group, was informed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cynthiana, Kentucky, that an unidentified flying object had been sighted in the Wallingford, Kentucky area. The Lexington Field Office in turn contacted headquarters, Region V, 109th CIC Group, Louisville, Kentucky, and relayed the following information:

On 7 September 1959, at approximately 0230 hours, an unidentified flying object was sighted by _______ Rural Mail Carrier, Route Wallingford, Kentucky. The object was approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, 15 to 20 feet in depth, and gave off a glowing phosphorescent light. The object appeared to be approximately 40 yards north of State Highway 559, and seemed to be resting stationary in the air, 40 to 50 feet above the ground. Tree tops could be seen 150 feet away by the light given off by the object. The light was such that it did not bother ogden's eyes. It was described as being like a light given off by a radium dial on a watch or clock. Ogden watched the object from 30 seconds to one minute, when suddenly a blaze of deep blue fire resembling a gas flame was expelled out of the bottom of the object. The object rose perpendicularly to a height of 400 to 500 feet. The flame went out, and the object traveled horizontally to the ground in an easterly direction and out of sight. (P-6)

2. On 14 September 1959, an investigation was conducted by Region V, 109th CIC Group personnel at the approximate scene of the reported incident. A ring was marked in the ground approximately 3 inches wide around a circumference of approximately 12 feet 3 inches. Dimensions estimated by the Kentucky State Police in two directions across the circle were 12 feet 3 inches, and 12 feet 4 inches. The circle was burned on an approximate 1 to 2 degree slope, forming an almost perfect circle. The ground was a hard, white soil. No foreign objects were found in the area which was estimated to have been traversed by approximately 150 people on 13 and 14 September. The ground in the burned-out area seemed of a fuel product similar to kerosene, since the object was seen, there had been a rainfall in the area on 9 September 1959 estimated at from approximately .3 to .5 inches.
