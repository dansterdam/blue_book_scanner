TO:
Capt. Parker received a report from Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control at 2230Z, 13 Sept. 59 -
Report received from Marshfield, Ky., police who reported it to Indianapolis ARTC. 
Yorkhead State Police received a call from a Mr. Wallingford, Ky., 12 Sept. 59, at 0230 EST, on that date. He reported that he looked outside and saw a large, round object hovering at a low altitude. He said it looked like a plastic balloon, about the size of a Goodyear blimp, except it had a reddish light on top and bottom and it seemed to have a slight rocking motion. He said it remained in that position for about 15-20 minutes, then moved away at a high rate of speed. No sound but it left a blue ring of smoke which remained for 15 minutes. No reported damage. When object moved, a bluish flame observed. Yorkhead State Police investigated and reported it to Indianapolis ARTC.
This is apparently still visible and State Police are apparently still at the scene. There are no photographs. Capt. Parker would call to get this report Monday morning and then take the necessary action.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION
1. On 7 September 1959, the Lexington Field Office, Lexington, Kentucky, was informed by the Paducah Bureau of Investigation, Cynthiana, Kentucky, that an unidentified flying object had been sighted in the Wallingford, Kentucky area. The investigation was conducted by the 139th CIC Group, Louisville, Kentucky, and they relayed the following information:

On 7 September 1959, at approximately 9:20 PM, an unidentified flying object was sighted by a rural mail carrier, Route 5, Wallingford, Kentucky. The object was observed to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and gave off a glowing phosphorescent light. The object appeared to be approximately 400-500 feet in the air and hovered, then moved up and down and side to side for about 30 minutes. The light was such that it did not bother the carrier's eyes. It was described as being a light of deep blue color, and when watched from 30 seconds to one minute, when suddenly a place of deep blue fire seemed to develop in the center of the object. The object then disappeared and reappeared at a height of about 500 feet. The flame went out and the object traveled out of sight.

2. On 14 September 1959, an investigation was conducted by Region V, 139th CIC Group personnel at the approximate scene of the reported incident. It was determined that there was a disturbance in the area, and a consideration of the physical evidence at the scene indicated that the object was approximately 12 feet 3 inches and 12 feet 4 inches. The circle was turned on an approximately 20 degree angle, forming an almost perfect circle. The ground was hard, with no foreign objects found in the area which was not disturbed to have been traversed by approximately 150 people on 13 and 14 September 1959. Since the object was seen, there had been a rainfall in the area on 9 September 1959 approximately 1.2 to 1.5 inches.
