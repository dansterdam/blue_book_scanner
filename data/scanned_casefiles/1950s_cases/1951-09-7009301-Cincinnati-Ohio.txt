8. In a discussion with the weather forecaster at Department of Commerce, Weather Bureau, Cincinnati, it was determined that a balloon was used by Louisville, Kentucky which was seen at Cincinnati. The winds aloft's were turbulent enough to restrict the balloon's travel. On the morning the object was sighted, the weather was clear, making improbable; therefore making improbable the possibility of the object being a balloon from Louisville.

9. An analysis of the foregoing information can arrive at no definite conclusion as to the identity of the object in question. Corroboration, with no other confirmatory information compels an F-2 evaluation.
