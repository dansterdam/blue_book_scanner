one of train crew who watched UFO's.

hours of heavy bomber time and knows
what planes look like. "We see planes
every night, lots of them." Bridge is-

UFO
BUZZES TRAIN
The Crew of Monon No. 91 had strange company on their way to
Indianapolis—four companionable, curious UFO's.

The train crew on Monon southbound freight Number 91 saw the
UFO's best of all. For them it was
a night to remember.

Witnesses near Kokomo saw
them as elliptical lighted objects

about have touched edges so they
must have been somewhere around
30 feet across the bottom."

In answer to a question Bridge
said, "We had flashlights in the en-
gine and in the caboose. Up on the
head end of the train—in the en-
gine where I was—we blinked our
flashlights at the things and we
waved the lights. We thought we
might get them to come in closer.

They did come over the train
a few minutes later, as Robinson
told you, but, of course, I can't say
they did it because we flashed the
lights at them. At any rate they
didn't flash any lights back at us."
Robinson, said, "In the caboose
we had a five cell sealed beam
flashlight that throws a pretty good
beam a long ways. When the thing
came down and flew right up the
tracks behind the caboose, I grab-
bed that sealed beam flashlight
and shined it on them. As soon as
the light hit them they jumped
sideways out of the beam. When
they got back on the tracks I
did it again and they scattered.

They said the lights on them then they didn't come in close
any more. While we were switching
at Frankfort they stayed away
back up the tracks, just hovered
there, until we moved on. Then
they followed us again. When they
finally went away at Kirklin they
just zipped off to the northeast and
kept on going and we didn't see
them anymore."

It was an astounding experience
to train crew of Moon Number
100, in the annals of such things,
for its duration and because the
objects gave evidence of intelligent
control by dodging away from the
flashlight beams.

The television interview with
Cecil Bridge and Edward Robin-
son got on the newswires that some
night.

On the following day along
with the other members of the train
crew, were notified by Moon offi-
cials to keep quiet if they saw any-
similar objects in the future. Bunker Hill Air Force base near Kokomo, about 30 miles east of the scene
of this sighting, had asked the railroad to contact the base at once
should such objects again appear.

According to officials of the Moon
Number 100 train crew at Lafayette, the Bunker Hill AF
base has installed a special line to

the dispatchers office in Lafayette, urged the train crew to be especially watchful between three and four
o'clock in the morning.

UFOS SERIOUS BUSINESS
(Excerpt from statement issued by the
Defense Department, December 24, 1959)

Unidentified flying objects - sometimes
treated lightly by the press and referred
to as "flying saucers" - must be rapidly
and accurately identified as serious USAF
business in the Zone of Interior. As AFR
200-2 points out, the Air Force concern
with these sightings is threefold: First
of all, is the object a threat to the defense of the U.S.? Secondly, does it contribute to technical or scientific knowledge? And then there's inherent USAF
responsibility to explain to the American
people through public information media
what is going on in their skies.

The phenomena or actual objects comprising
UFO's will tend to increase, with the public more aware of goings on in space but
still inclined to some apprehension. Technical and defense considerations will continue to exist in this area.

What is required is that every UFO sighting be investigated and reported to the
Air Technical Intelligence Center at
Wright-Patterson AFB and that explanation to the public be realistic and knowledgeable.

They got real bright and white—
like stars, but a lot bigger and mov-
ing very fast.

Cecil Bridge, observing the same
objects from the engine describes
what he and the engineer and head
brakeman saw:

"When these things shot back
over to the east us they lit up
much brighter than they were be-
fore. They turned in line, going
north or northeast and we noticed
that they lit up in sequence—the
front one first, then number two,
three and four. They changed
course and came back past the
train. They were going in the oppo-
site direction to us when they made
this pass. I guess they were at least
a mile or two east as we when they
did it.

"They lit up twice like I told
you; first number one would light
up, then number two and so on.
They did that twice as they went
past us travelling in the opposite
direction. We noticed, too, that
their color changed. When first
lit up they were bright white but
when they slowed down the color
changed to a kind of yellow, then
to orange when they went real slow

—a kind of dirty orange."
Robinson agreed with this de-
scription. He added:
"We didn't see them from the
back end of the train for several
minutes after they went away to
the east and turned. But the boys

in the engine were still seeing them,
and he was watching then right
then. They must have circled the
train and gone north of us, real low,
because the next time we saw them
they came rushing up the tracks
right in back of us. They were com-
ing a lot faster this time—a lot
faster than they had come back
over the train the first time.

"They were just above the tree-
tops along the right of way, and
they had changed their way of fly-
ing—their formation. This time
they were sort of flying on edge.
Two of them were on edge—the
two in the middle. The two on the
outside were tilted at an angle both
in the same direction. The four of
them flew like that up the tracks
behind the train—a tilted one on
the east, two of them straight up
and down, then one on the west
tilted just like the one on the east.

"When they first came back over
the train we could see that they
were round things—circular shaped
on the bottom. Then when they
flew up the tracks in back of us we
could see—me and Seabey—that
they were about 40 feet in diameter
and maybe 10 feet thick. The two
that were flying straight up and
down were just about over the
edges of the right of way and about
200 yards in back of the caboose.
If they had been flying flat, down
instead of edgewise they would just

Oct. 6th in Cliffside Park, N. J., which is the neighboring town to Fort Lee. Three tree surgeons from nearby River Edge went out on a job. According to their story, they were watching a jet plane of USO observers. Accordingly to their story, they came into sight. Unlike the Jet, the UFO's left no vapor trail. Also, they were going at about twice the speed of the Jet, and were in formation. They remained in sight for two minutes....

LANDING IN KENTUCKY: A saucer landed in a rural area near Stephens-
burg, Kentucky, last October 6th, and was witnessed by a Mrs. ___________
She looked out of her kitchen window at about 6 a.m., and saw a silver-colored
object sitting in a nearby field. She thought at first it was her husband's
pick-up truck, and forgot about it. But the object stayed on. At 8:30 hrs. le-
ver looked again, and it was still there. Curious by now, she called a neigh-
bor and asked him to investigate. The neighbor started into the field, but
when he got to within about 300 yards of the object, it started rolling along
the ground and then took off, going almost straight up. The UFO was described
as triangular in shape, looking much like an ice cream cone. It was about the
size of a pick-up truck, and had short stubby wings that moved back and forth
as it took off. It had no propellor and made no noise. After leaving the
ground, the object hovered over the field for another 45 minutes. Small wheel
marks were found at the spot where the saucer had rolled along the ground.

Two Hunters See
Eerie Sky Lights
Tuesday with a story of sighting strange sky lights.   Two Salem deer hunters were
450 Beck Avenue, S.E. arrived at the Pine Mt. Area near Millican about
3 a.m. Tuesday morning. For about 20 minutes, as they were hunting
for a camping site, a white and red light seemed to leap past their
car at a distance. At first they believed it was either car lights on a distant
mountain or a camp fire.

Then the light, alternately bright and dim, sped toward the car, suddenly
falling and nearing the ground to the right and slightly ahead of them.   As
the ground became illuminated the lights went out.

Both men said the white light was the most brilliant with the red light becoming it.

They refused to remain in the area and returned to Sisters. There, they
said, a waitress reported two other groups of persons had like-wise reported sighting the same type of light recently in the same general area.
Bob Brant is employed by Southern Pacific R.R. and his brother is home
on leave from the AAR FORCE.*

Bob said that they considered reporting the event to the state police, but
did not because they thought that the police would not believe them....*

Blinking Flying
Object Sighted
Over Salem

Here is the second headline and the story:
"... A strange unidentified flying object with
red and white blinking lights was seen by some
Salem residents Monday night.

Thomas Warren, Leslie Jr. High Mathematics
instructor, and Beverly Shriver, 14 year old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William Shriver 3856
Science Avenue, S., reported they both saw a
rectangular shaped object hovering in the West-
ern skies."

THEN increased speed and flew toward Portland, Warren said. A Portlander
also reported seeing the object. A radio station reported.

Saucers Fly On

Despite the somewhat frantic efforts of a small but vocal faction of our respected Air Force to debunk them; despite the Air Force's Charlie McCarthy efforts and their well-publicized efforts to explain them away as mock suns or mirages—the flying saucers stubbornly and lightly refuse to say goodbye!

On Oct. 3, 1958, at 3:20 a.m. a group of four round neon-like objects, in an open V formation, swooped down upon a fast freight train, and played tag with it for well over an hour, observed by all the train crewmen and residents in nearby towns from Illinois to Indiana.

No weird, lunar fringe contacts with Martians or Venusians; no mythical rides in mythical saucers. Just good, honest, man-in-the-street observation.

Office of Public Information
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Gentlemen:

Please refer to my letter of January 25, 1959.

On January 38 I received News Release NO. 63-59 of January 22, this year, concerning the Air Force UFO Study. This not, of course, an answer to my letter, in which I requested specific information, repeated as follows for your convenience:

"I would greatly appreciate the acquisition of the basic details concerning these two cases that were considered 'unknown.' I realize that Air Force policy requires deleting the names of witnesses and certain data considered classified pertaining to radar and aircraft. However, such data as the date, location, number of objects, and size and shape of the objects, would be quite satisfactory.

"Various papers in Indiana carried an extremely interesting UFO observation made in the early morning hours of October 3, 1958, by the crewmen of Freight #91 of the Moron Railroad. - They reported seeing four disc-shaped objects in central Indiana that played 'tag' with their train for over an hour. What was the Air Force conclusion for this case?"

I would appreciate having a definite answer to my questions.

I am sending copies of this letter to certain members of Congress, including Senator Lyndon Johnson, whose attention has already been called to this matter.

Very truly yours,

[Signature redacted]
