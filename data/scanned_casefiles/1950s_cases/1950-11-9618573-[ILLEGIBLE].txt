The text I can discern on this document is very limited:

On the right side of the image, vertically, I can see the letter "O" (possibly part of a larger word that is cut off)

At the bottom of the image, there are some numerical markings: "125", "100", "75", "50", "25", and "0"

The document appears to be a map or chart with numerous numerical notations scattered across it, showing what seems to be geographic or meteorological data points. However, most of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly.

The document contains a grid-like structure with various numerical markings ranging from 00 to around 600. There are curved lines and what seem to be geographical or navigational markings. The right side of the image contains a curved scale or measurement indicator. Due to the image quality and complexity, many of the smaller numerical annotations are difficult to read precisely.

Mg Journal/dw/1959

1. Reference our LF dated 26 August 1958, same subject as above.

2. Large scale maps of the area in question were obtained and the correct spot located. It will be noted on Incl 1 that the water off the Viking of Climax is rather deep. According to Sgt Bates' sketch, the object would have fallen in at least 10 fathoms of water. A note for the object would diving during operation at this depth over an area of approximately one-half square mile or more. For this reason it is considered typical to request an attempt at recovery.

3. It is suggested that all documents pertaining to this case be filed in the event the future status of Project Blue Book warrants a recovery attempt.

4. All documents referring to this case are returned herewith.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

PROBLEM:
1. To prepare DP to AFIG.

ACTS AND DISCUSSION:
2. 1/Sgt [REDACTED] assigned to HQ at 4th AFB, recently appeared in person before Project Blue Book Personnel at ATIC and volunteered information concerning the sighting of an unl Obj in Chinn in Nov 50. He stated that the object bid fallen into the sea.

3. 3/Sgt [REDACTED] plotted and the approximate location on a map and drew a large scale sketch of the area.

4. This information was forwarded to AFOIN-242 for the purpose of determining the feasibility of an attempt to recover or otherwise locate and examine the object.

5. A hydrographic chart of the area was obtained to determine the soundings and terrain data. This feasibility study will be made with the hydrographic chart. ATIC is therefore being requested to reinvestigate the case. Sgt [REDACTED] in order to recover further details, the attached DP will accomplish this.

6. Subject matter will not be suitable for inclusion in the Daily Staff Digest.

ACTION RECOMMENDED:
7. Approval, signature and dispatch of attached DP.

Unfortunately, while the text is visible, the image quality is very poor and much of the text is illegible.

SOURCE: Well, now, the G.I. didn't see the splash. They did see the light. They thought it was just another aircraft. Lots of times aircraft would come over and turn on their lights to say "Hello". We'd think ours back to them.

CAPT RUPPELT: And they came up where you were playing pinochle and told you about it. It took them about three minutes to get up there?

SOURCE: A little longer than that, about five or ten minutes.

He says he is sure that core was two to three miles wide. Depth was four fathoms. Either [word] is confused on the location or the core is much smaller than he judged.

He offered to go back and point out spot. Says map must be wrong about so house in area he mentions. I doubt it, however.
