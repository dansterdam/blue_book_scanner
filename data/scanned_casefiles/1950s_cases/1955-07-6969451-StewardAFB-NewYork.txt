10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) circular object appeared to have a tail. The object was oblong in shape and varied in size. The object moved erratically and stayed stationary at times. The object described a circular path. The object maneuvered and drifted.
11. COMMENTS
A check with GCO Weather indicated that the winds at that time or slightly later were high and erratic and that at intervals between these directions. The description of the object indicates that it was maneuvers, and the wind and turbulence and a balloon. The fact that the object was visible for the 23 MDIV was that the winds were either erratic enough to keep the balloon aloft for this duration.
