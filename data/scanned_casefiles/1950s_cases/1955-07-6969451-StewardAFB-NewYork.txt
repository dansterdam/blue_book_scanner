10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1), circular, white, alternately flattened
on sides, appeared to have a tail. The object
moved to the south, north, and west and at
times describe a circular path. The object
seemed to oscillate and drift.

11. COMMENTS
A check with GC Weather indicated
that the winds at time of sighting
were blowing from the north, south,
and east and at intervals between
these directions. The description
of the object, its maneuvers, and
the winds substantiate a balloon
sighting. A preliminary report from
the 28 ADW was that the object was
a weather balloon. This headquarters
feels this was a rawinsonde balloon.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Probably Balloon
Possibly Balloon
