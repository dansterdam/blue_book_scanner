TIME. THE FACT THAT SEVERAL ADULTS, AS WELL AS, CHILDREN IN ONE GROUP SIGHTED THE OBJECTS PROVES THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HALLUCINATIONS.

IN FACT, THE INVESTIGATING STATE PATROL OFFICER STATED THAT UPON HEARING THE STORY HE LAUGHED, AND THE PEOPLE BECAME VERY INDIGNANT OF HIS MISBELIEF. NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION IS OFFERED FOR THE SIGHTED OBJECTS.
