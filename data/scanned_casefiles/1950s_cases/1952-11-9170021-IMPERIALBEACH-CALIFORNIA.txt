I relieved PARKS in tower. We both noticed a large yellow ball-like light orange color. It stood still for about 3 or 4 mins and then disappeared at a great rate of speed towards the W.S.W. I observed same thing. After PARKS left from tower on his patrol, same thing appeared again and PARKS called over radio to me and said "There it is again CHITTENDEN" and it went down behind the quarters in the upper compass room. PARKS told me that 15 men saw it, including air traffic controller, just above the water, there were no planes flying, there were no noise.
