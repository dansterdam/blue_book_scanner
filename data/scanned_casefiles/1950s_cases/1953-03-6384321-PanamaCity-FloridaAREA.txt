Force Base, ATIC A-2 2 April 1953, transmits electronic data on ground radar. 
Further investigation reveals that no additional information was obtained from the 
site at Nouasseur Air Base. The following report is based on the information of A/2c John Ibanes, AF-12381750, who has eight months experience in radar. An 
Electronics Data Sheet on ground radar was submitted to the operations weather 
units. However, his statement is included in this report. An extract of the flight 
dispatch records for 25 March 1953 has been included with the Tower Operator's Log.

The following information was received by the Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters 5th Air Division, from Headquarters 80th Air Depot Wing on 8 May 1953, and is transmitted for evaluation:

"a. In an interview with A/2C John Ibanes, AF-12381750, on 22 April 1953, the following report is forwarded. Statement of A/2C Thomas is as follows:

'At approximately 2200 hours, 25 March 1953, while I was on duty at the CCA Section at Nouasseur, I received a call from the 10 (Major Melvin O. Scheer) via the Nouasseur Control Tower warning to know how many blips I had on my Radar Screen. I reported that I had four (4). Approximately four (4) or five (5) minutes later I received another call from Major Scheer requesting that I keep a time log and also track the aircraft on my set. I kept this report as requested and it was turned over to the AO upon completion of duty.'

"b. Extract from Nouasseur Flight Dispatch Records for 25 March 1953: 2135: Tower notified at that AF 0181 was reporting an unidentified object flying ground their aircraft. - 2150: Notified GSI when 918K reported that the object now seemed to be stationary.

"c. Report of landings and take-offs at Nouasseur, 25 March 53:
French aircraft #FBFOF C-54 landed from Marseille 2120 hours.
Aircraft 3007, C-47 (Pilot Captain Stuart M. Pritchard AO-674520) ATO 1732 landed at 2140.

On Wednesday, 25 March 1953, Mrs. [redacted] of Panama City area observed one (1) unidentified flying object which was circular and shiny flying straight and level towards Panama City. Mrs. [redacted] was the only one who reported this event, and her observation was made from inside her house looking out the window. Since the object was quite far away, Mrs. [redacted] could not determine the distance or the altitude.

COMMENT BY THE PREPARING OFFICER: Since there were a minimum of thirty (30) jet aircraft airborne in the general vicinity of Panama City at the time of the observation, this object could have been the reflection of a jet for observer states that possibility.

1. Observer sighted one (1) unidentified flying object which was circular in shape and shiny in color. No aerodynamic features, exhaust, propulsion system, sound, or any maneuvers were noticed. Since the object was quite far away, observer could not determine the distance or altitude.

2. Observation was made at approximately 1500 Central Standard Time, 25 March 1953, for three (3) seconds.

3. Visual ground observation was made.

4. Observer was sitting in a chair inside her house about ten (10) feet away from the window. Approximate location- Latitude-30°N; Longitude-85°W. The object was going directly away from viewer on a straight and level course towards Panama City.

5. This was the first time that Mrs. Bruce has experienced such an observation. Upon being interviewed Mrs. Bruce seemed quite sincere.

6. Weather was CAVU. Surface winds were WNW at 14 knots; gusty to 22 knots. At 1000'-290°-26K; at 1500'-290°-26K; at 2000'-290°-26K; at 6000'-310°-42K; at 7000'-310°-42K; at 8000'-310°-55K; at 16,000'-300°-85K.

8. There were no fragments or photographs taken.

9. Air Force Form 112 submitted in compliance with existing regulations.

10. There was a minimum of thirty (30) jets in the general area of Panama City at the time of the sighting. Operations comments that the general approach to the field would be in line generally with the direction that the object was going.

SUBJECT: Flying Saucers

On Wednesday, 25 March 1952, at about 3 o'clock (Central Standard Time) I observed one (1) unidentified flying object which was circular and shiny. I could not determine the altitude, but the object was flying straight and level from Greenwood Cemetery near the city of Saint Andrews towards Panama City, Florida. I first sighted the object while sitting in a chair looking out the window. The sun was not shining in the window, but away from it, so that it cast a reflection of the object.

When I first sighted the object it was quite far away, and I have no idea of the actual or estimated distance. I watched the object for about three (3) seconds, and then rushed to the front door in an attempt to get another look, but the object had disappeared. It could have been possibly a very fast jet aircraft.
