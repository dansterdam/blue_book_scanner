SUBJECT: UFO Check

TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

1. Reference your message ACTIC-EDE, 5-61-13, a negative report is submitted from this detachment for date and time mentioned.

2. For information, at 0215%, 2 Apr 58, this detachment received a telephone call from a Mrs. who reported she observed a green, flare and that she believed it was over Homestead AFB. She could not estimate the altitude or distance from her. The telephone connection was severed by her breaking additional communication could be developed.

3. At 0230%, 2 Apr 58, the above information was relayed to Control Tower, Miami International Airport, where the Tower Watch Supervisor, advised that he saw what appeared to be a flaring star in the East, approximately 30 minutes earlier. It was up for about one-second only and was just above the horizon when he saw it. He could furnish no additional information, inasmuch as he did not consider it a very unusual occurrence.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Bright unidentified light in sky. Viewed for about 20 seconds. Obj moving SW in semi-circular wave. Did not appear to be a/c. Rpt fm coast guard. Light was bright white.

11. COMMENTS
Request for additional info resulted in info on another case. Nothing added to the original rpt. Possibly searchlight, however, since the observer should be familiar with conditions in his area a more probable solution is a meteor sighting. It is not unusual for meteors to be without tails, and since the duration is rather long this meteor was probably a fireball.
