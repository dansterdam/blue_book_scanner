The bottom half of the page contains what seems to be a hand-drawn diagram or sketch with various lines, arrows, and notations.]

The text in the top portion is too difficult to transcribe with complete certainty due to the handwriting and image quality.

Dear Sir:

The other night myself and two other friends standing around to spy when we could look. There we saw a round bright white that had a tail on the end and it was red. The other color was yellow and white. It came down on a slant from the star. It moved slowly and the color was beautiful. It was kind of been a comet to a falling slow because it was very coming and they said it seemed like a flying sauce and they told me to write to you and see what you said. Remember they were at Shawmut. We also saw this night in the sky little round things with it which went through the sky fading away yet with great speed some distance and left it out of them. It was red and white. This was a series of two or three points going a cross out. I will send two points of little there you can see.
