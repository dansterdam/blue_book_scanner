ATIC Comment:
1. Checked with balloon schedule
show one was sighted at New York bar
just prior to sighting.

2. The wind direction given would
make the object in direction reported
by observer.

3. It has typically been proven that
when balloons are sighted at dawn
or dusk, they will look red, orange,
etc. The sun was low, dim
enough for the observer, thus it
but the balloon was high enough
to pick up its rays, ballcox[?]

Northern Lights Give
Bright, Colorful Show

Shimmering area and fiery curtains of red, green and white blaze
across the sky in a dazzling phenomenon known as the northern lights
or aurora borealis Monday night.

Sky-gazer throughout Fairborn and most of the nation observed the
lights which spread over a wide area at high latitudes.

The lights were observed in points as scattered as Boston, New
York, Des Moines, Ia., Albuquerque, N.M., Tulsa, Okla., Nashville,
Tenn., Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago and as far west as Vera Beach.

One person living in the Wright View area called the Daily Herald
after seeing the red sky to know if Fairborn had a big fire.

The unusually intense display had marked effect on radio transmissions and teletype wires. Radio hams in the Minneapolis area reported they were unable to operate during the display.
