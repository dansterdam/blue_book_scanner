The observer, a civilian, reported seeing an object in the sky which he described as a bright ball of light moving rapidly in an east-to-west direction at an altitude of 10,000 feet, disappearing from sight after approximately 20 seconds. The object was first noticed over Rosalia, Washington, and moved toward Spokane, Washington, at a rapid speed. The observer stated that the object appeared to be metallic and emitted no exhaust or trail.

UNCLASSIFIED
Rosalia, Washington
I. Description of Incident
A B-29 aircraft was in flight in the vicinity of Spokane, Washington, when one of the crew members sighted an unusual object. The flight was at 32,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of around three to five minutes as an unidentified course circling and drifting in the air. It was visually observed for a period of approximately 45-55 seconds.
II. Discussion of Incident
ATIC determined that a scheduled balloon payload was in the general area at the time of sighting. U.S. Weather Bureau records indicate a scheduled gas balloon release took place at 0900Z on 7 February 1955 from Miles City, Montana. It was estimated the balloon would take approximately four hours to reach the general vicinity of the sighting. If the object sighted was the gas balloon, it would have taken approximately 45-55 seconds for it to pass the aircraft, which is consistent with the visual observation time. Therefore, it is concluded that the object sighted was probably the gas balloon.
III. Conclusion
Probably balloon.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a report on a balloon released at 09002 from the U.S. Weather Bureau station at Rosalia, Washington on February 6, 1953. The text describes details about the balloon release, including the balloon's ascent and trajectory, as well as observations about the wind speeds and altitude factors that affected the balloon's movement.

Text from the document:

6 February 1953 - Rosalia, Washington 

Pibail balloon released at 09002 from U.S. Weather Bureau station at Rosalia, Washington. Track of balloon 35S.

Slanting was from over Rosalia to 19.5 miles south in 15 minutes. Wind at 10,000' was from approximately 270째 to 280째 blowing 50 ft. (15.2 m) per second.

60 minutes - 1 min - 59

The balloon would have covered the 12.5 nautical miles in 15 minutes, which would indicate that the actual release was at 09051. This would mean that the wind speeds as observed were at 27 ft. (8.2 m) per second. The time difference of 2 minutes can be accounted for by different factors such as different wind speeds at various altitudes.

Note: Apparent rate of a 30 pound Standard Zodiac to clear the 50 ft. to pass would be approximately 1.7 minutes.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a document page discussing weather balloons and saucers. The text on the page provides details about sightings of unidentified flying objects, including a specific incident near Rosallia, Washington on February 9, 1953 involving a U.S. Air Force pilot. The text analyzes various evidence and concludes that the UFO sighting was likely a weather balloon.

Transcribed text from the document:

Weather Balloons and Saucers

In the early years of the saucer era balloons accounted for some 25 percent of the unidentified flying objects reported to ATIC. The pattern of these sightings is unmistakable, and the identity of balloons and their nature as certain as any evidence can be. Nevertheless many such identifications are resolutely rejected by the saucer enthusiasts to whom it is disconcerting to dismiss an observation as the flight of a balloon. But we can summarize a few of the more famous cases.

On February 9, near Rosalia, Washington, a pilot had sighted a 15-30 ft weather balloon. During this encounter the pilot saw to his left a large unknown object which he described as moving erratically with a sound which he termed "whistling" and then "disappeared."

The evidence exists that the light was either a "saucer" or a meteorological object; but the real probability is that it was a balloon. Investigations by ATIC determined the following facts:

On February 9, 1953, the pilot of a T-33 jet plane bound for Spokane, Washington, was near Rosalia when he sighted a round, white object rising at a speed estimated at 15째 to 120째 above the horizon. While trying to identify the object, the pilot observed a larger object which he described as metallic, about 50 ft in diameter, rising slowly in view for 15 to 20 minutes. The larger object was estimated to be 10 miles southwest of the pilot's position. As the pilot proceeded on a southeast course, the R-33 made a pass to the left and the larger object disappeared. The pilot could not identify it.

At a later date, thirteen minutes before the sighting, the United States Weather Bureau at Fairchild Air Force Base had released a pilot balloon. Winds aloft at altitudes of 6,000 to 30,000 feet were from the northeast with a speed of about fifty knots. Computations showed that the existing winds would have carried the balloon to the southwest, and it would have been over Rosalia, which is 125 nautical miles from the Fairchild Air Force Base, in about fifteen minutes. The plane sighted the unknown near Rosalia thirteen minutes after the launching. This, together with other evidence, supports ATIC's conclusion that the UFO was a weather balloon.

The image appears to contain a blurred or indistinct object in the center of the frame, which may resemble some kind of aerial phenomenon or unidentified flying object. However, the image quality is quite low, and the object is not clearly defined, making it difficult to definitively identify what it depicts.

CASE OFFICER'S REPORT

1. TIME AND PLACE OF OBSERVATION: 9 February 1953, Rosalia, Washington, approximately 20 miles south of Spokane, Washington.

2. WITNESSES: Mrs. Jane Doe reported seeing a strange object in the sky.

3. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S): Witness reported seeing a bright, round object in the sky that appeared to be approximately 100 feet in diameter. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes before it accelerated and disappeared from view.

4. WEATHER CONDITIONS: Clear skies, no wind.

5. INVESTIGATION: Investigator visited the site and interviewed the witness. No other witnesses were located. No physical evidence was recovered.

6. CONCLUSIONS: The origin and nature of the object observed remains unknown. There is insufficient information to determine if this was a legitimate UFO sighting or some other natural or man-made phenomenon.

Reldmann, A/B, RCAF 0618/COX February 17 instructed. Filling Service Center
S-33 observer of 7707 was in flight in the vicinity of Spokane, Washington. Approximately 6:15 PM, PST. Observer was one of two pilots in the aircraft flying at 12,000 feet, which was moving at about 300 mph. The observer first noticed a bright light ahead of the aircraft which appeared to be at an altitude of 100 miles. The light seemed to be white with a red tinge to it. The aircraft approached the light, and the distance between the aircraft and light continued to decrease. Then the light departed at a speed which was estimated to be several thousand miles per hour, and it disappeared from sight in a few seconds. The occurrence was witnessed by both pilots, and it was an unusual occurrence.

Weather conditions at the time are described as excellent, with unusually good visibility.
