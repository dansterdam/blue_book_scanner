Rosalia, Washington                                                6 February 1953

I.   Description of Incident

    A B-36 aircraft was in flight in the vicinity of Spokane, Washington, when one round white omnidirectional light was sighted at 0913Z time. The light was at an altitude of approximately 7,000 ft. on a southeast course circling and climbing as it proceeded. It was visually observed for a period of three to five minutes. The B-36 mile 15° descending turn toward the light which was estimated to be moving at a speed of 150 to 200 knots. The aircraft was inbound to Spokane 15 miles out and located over Rosalia, Washington.

II.  Discussion of Incident

    ATIC determined that a scheduled pibal balloon released at 09000 ft in the U.S. Weather Bureau Station at Fairchild AFB was in the immediate area of sighting. A lighting weather balloon in the area of the sightings winds would have to be out of the N.E. Winds aloft at 7,000 to 10,000 ft. were from 270° to 280° at approximately 15 knots per hour. Checked for the balloon to be carried to Rosalia by the existing winds. Since the unidentified object was sighted 30 minutes after the balloon launch, and the description (white running lights) parallels the maneuvers of a balloon, ATIC concludes that the object probably was the pibal weather balloon. All local air fields were checked by McBroad AFB and other than the B-36.

III. Conclusion

    Probably balloon.

6 February 1953 - Rosalia, Washington 5-36 Sighting Analysis:

Piball balloon released at 0900S from U.S. weather bureau station at Fairchild A.F.B. Track of balloon 335.

Sighting was from over Rosalia 12.5 nautical miles SE of Fairchild. Wind at 10,000' was from approximately 270° to 280° blowing at 50 knots per hour.

60 minutes        X min - 15
50 nautical miles        15.7 M.P.H.

or the balloon would have covered the 12.5 nautical miles in 15 minutes.

Which means that the piball released at Fairchild A.F.B. would have taken approximately 15 minutes to drift to the area of sighting since the unknown object was sighted at 0913S and was drifting into tracking. Using the winds aloft, it can be deduced that the object sighted by the B-36 and the piball balloon are probably the same object.

The time difference of 2 minutes can be ignored in that intangible factors such as different wind speeds at various altitudes, etc.

Weather Balloons and Saucers

In the early years of the saucer era balloons accounted for some 25 percent of the unidentified flying objects reported to ATIC. The pattern of these sightings is unmistakable, and the identity of balloon and UFO is often certain-as certain as any evidence can be. Nevertheless many such identifications are resolutely rejected by the saucer enthusiasts. It would be pointless to discuss all the UFO reports of this class, but we can summarize a few of the most famous. Major Keyhoe, a leading proponent of the interplanetary hypothesis describes such a sighting:

"On February 6 near Rosalia, Washington, a saucer had circled a B-36 bomber. During this maneuver the pilot saw a white light. Blink it seemed. Before he had time to blink his own light in answer, the machine swifth turned south and disappeared."
[5 p 2 p]

No evidence exists that the light was either a 'saucer' or a 'machine', a great deal of evidence that it was a balloon. Investigators from ATIC determined the following facts:

At 1:13 p.m. on February 6, 1953, the pilot of a B-36 plane bound for Spokane, Washington, was near Rosalia when he sighted a round white light below him, circling and rising at a speed estimated at 150 to 200 knots as it proceeded on a southeast course. The B-36 made a 6 degree descending turn toward the light, which was in view for a period of three to five minutes, but the pilot could not identify it.

At 1:01 p.m., thirteen minutes before the sighting, the United States Weather Bureau station at Fairchild Air Force Base had released a pibal balloon. Winds aloft at altitudes of 7000 to 10,000 feet were from the northwest with a speed of about fifty knots. Computations showed that the existing winds would have carried the balloon to the northeast, and it would have been over Rosalia, which is 12.5 nautical miles southeast of Fairchild Air Force Base, in about fifteen minutes. The plane sighted the unknown near Rosalia thirteen minutes after the launching. The balloon carried white running lights which accounted for the "blinking" described, and the circling climb of the UFO is typical of a balloon's course. Thus all the evidence supports ATIC's conclusion that the UFO was a weather balloon. [2]

Teletype WINMX 061800Z February by Moffat Flight Service Center

B-36 number 2708 was in flight in the vicinity of Spokane, Washington, 6 February 1953, when one point white light was sighted, approaching B-2708 from the north. The light was at an altitude of approximately 7,000 feet, on a south course, when it was at 2708, B-2708 made a descending 180° turn toward the light, which was moving at about 150 to 200 knots. The light circled several times, then turned to a course of approximately 120° and appeared to be two seconds intervals, its speed increased noticeably, and it disappeared on a Southerly course.

The light was sighted at 1104-52, by Major Leo J. Moffats, 407526603, 327th Bombardment Squadron, Fairchild Air Force Base, Spokane, Washington, from aboard B-2708, and was visually observed for approximately three to five minutes. B-2708 was inbound, approximately 10 to 15 miles out on the South leg of the Spokane radio range (inbound course 13° magnetic), at the time of the sighting, descending from 10,000 to 7,000 feet, during sighting aircraft turned to proceed toward Rosalia, Washington (46°20'W, 117°)

Weather report for Fairchild Air Force Base at time of sighting: Ceiling measured 1,200 feet, overcast above 1,500 feet, visibility 15 miles, high altitude, and wind at 10,000 feet above the surface from 270° at 50 knots.

Check of all area agencies revealed no aircraft which should have been in the area. No known conditions would account for the sighting.

Comments of Traversing Officer:

1. Sighting position of 47°21'N, 115°20'W indicated by paragraph D of the teletype message is apparently in error, as this position is approximately 90 statute miles from position indicated by Smith Log of Spokane Public Power and Rosalia, Washington. This position has been resolved to 47°20'N, 117°30'W.

2. New position of Major Moffatt, and/or position in AC 2708 at time of sighting, was not indicated.

3. Direction, number, and size of circles by the light, and whether at constant altitude, was not indicated.

4. No variation in intensity of the light, between approach and departure, or during change in report was noted. Though intense, the light was horizontally omnidirectional, instead of focused like a landing light or jet exhaust glow. It is also noted that although AC 2708 was apparently constantly ascending during the sighting, no change in light intensity was caused by this ascent. This could indicate vertical omnidirectional light qualities.

5. Manner of disappearance of the light was not reported (whether extinguished, or diminished by distance) but message indicates that it faded due to distance.

6. The area in which sighting occurred is in an Air Defense Identification Zone, and any aircraft or flying objects should have been under radar surveillance. Positive statement that radar sites had not observed the incident is not included.

7. Although teletype message indicates that no propulsion system was observed, the correlation between flashing of the light and its increase in speed could indicate action of a propulsive system.
