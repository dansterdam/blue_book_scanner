Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any photograph or image present in the provided document. The document appears to be a typed text report from Project Blue Book describing a UFO sighting incident that occurred on March 22-23, 1957 near Oxnard, California. The text details the sighting by an Air Force duty officer, the ground observer's report, and the conclusion that the sighting was "probably star Arcturus" despite the proximity of the object to the ground. The report also mentions the lack of radar contact and ground radar data during the incident.

PART ONE

I. SOURCE: 
Name: Deleted 
Address: Oxnard, California

Sex: F
Occupation: Housewife
Education: High School plus 2.5 years of accounting

II. DETAILS:
If, at any time, this informant was a Government employee or connected with the Armed Forces, it is not known... The informant was a Registered Nurse of about 35 years of age. Though appearing in good health when seen, she said that she had been ill for the past 6 months with "hardening of the arteries." She seemed to be an intelligent and responsible person. 

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING AND EVENTS:
At approximately 7:20 P.M. PST 3/5/57, the witness was excited to see an object that appeared to be "streaking" skyward. She called her husband, who also observed it. They both observed the object for about 10 minutes. 

The object appeared to be spinning and was changing shape constantly, but maintaining an overall round or oval shape. It appeared to be about the size of a "silver dollar" at arm's length. It was a bright bluish-white color and seemed to be emitting a pulsating light. The object seemed to be at an altitude of about 1,000 to 1,500 feet. It seemed to be ascending at a moderate speed, not extremely fast. The object appeared to be about the size of a "silver dollar" at arm's length.

Source described the glow from the object as giving the impression of a "glowing glass jar" with a bright light source inside. Source said the object appeared to be osculating or pulsating rather than emitting a steady beam of light. The object was clearly visible and well-defined, not hazy or indistinct. It appeared to move in a straight line at a constant speed until it disappeared from view.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
THIS SIGHTING IS CONSIDERED TO BE POSSIBLY VALID BASED ON THE DETAILS REPORTED AND THE APPARENT RELIABILITY OF THE SOURCE.

STATEMENT

On 23 Mar 1957, I got up to go to bed. Answered my phone which rang and I decided to go to the bathroom. On the way, in the kitchen, I looked out the window and noticed a bright light in the sky, about the same brightness as the planet Venus. It seemed to be hovering or standing still. The light was a circular object and flickered. I called Oxnard Air Base at Camarillo, California's suggestion. Capt. Lindsley's suggestion: "Carol, I watched the object through field glasses from my home. It seemed to be hovering about 15 miles west of Oxnard. I observed it for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, from 4:50 a.m. to 6:05 a.m. on the morning of 23 Mar 1957." I called you to report the incident.

Wilson of the California Highway Patrol, VENTURA, CALIFORNIA, sighted an unidentified flying object in the Oxnard area. As the officers were patrolling along Highway 101, approximately 15 miles south of Oxnard, they observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed. The officers stopped their vehicle to observe the object more closely. They stated that the object was diamond-shaped, about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and was surrounded by a bright white light. The object appeared to them to be approximately 500 to 1000 feet in altitude and was traveling in a northeasterly direction. After observing the object for about 5 to 10 minutes, it suddenly increased its speed and disappeared from view.

GET EARL WATSON OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL, VENTURA, CALIFORNIA. WATSON, AN OFFICER ON DUTY, SAW THE OBJECT AN FILED A REPORT ON THE SIGHTING.

PAGE 12 OF 13 PAGES

It was reported that there was a scramble underway and would ask the aircraft to check the area. 
AIRCRAFT vectored the aircraft into the area and an attempt was made to orient them.
From control tower RADAR operators the aircraft was picked up and a course of 290 Degrees was given them to intercept. This was recognized by the pilot and it appeared they knew they were being tracked. However, the aircraft dove and disippeared below the level of the radar. The last radar contact was at 9:25 PM. No visual contact was ever made. 
The onboard RADAR-OPERATOR reported they had a return on scope which faded in and out but could never gain a visual. They immediately had a report submitted over the communications net.
The reported objects were described as "unidentified" and were under control sight and sound by the group at R-1.
Although on several occasions (sic) the ground observers (sic) reported the aircraft making sharp turns, abrupt changes of direction or level, and dives, the overall operation was broken off at 9:25 PM when radar contact was lost. The entire operation was broken off at that time.
The following police officers were in the area and reported the incident:
James P. Wallison

Oxnard, Calif.
Don Shaul

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
1. The opinion of the preparing officer is that, while the sighting was caused by stars (not strong enough to appear as the reported objects), the presence of the objects did cause an amount of confusion and could possibly be explained as an optical illusion during the sighting.
2. The presence of the very bright stars and the illumination of the objects near them could probably explain why the objects were thought to have appeared bigger, brighter, and closer than they actually were. It is possible that the intensity and size of the stars caused the illusion that they were closer objects.
3. It is difficult to explain the disappearance and reappearance of the objects, but the fact that they were not shown on the radarscope, and that no aircraft were mentioned as in the vicinity would probably rule out any known type of aircraft. An optical phenomenon could possibly explain the sighting.

COMMENTS OF THE APPROVING OFFICER:
Concurs with the report of the officer that this sighting was caused by stars. It is felt that the radar paints in no way were connected to the visual sighting. There is no evidence to substantiate the Approving Officer's conclusion.

2. The objects sighted over Camarillo, California, toward the north and east were traveling at speeds and on courses which indicated they were under intelligent control. They were observed to execute sudden changes in direction without loss of speed or altitude, and to hover briefly at times. The objects displayed no visible means of propulsion, though they were seen to emit a bright light. These observations were made by several competent and reliable observers from various locations. Their attention was first attracted to the objects by their unusual maneuvers and bright illumination.

Report on Oxnard UFO Case - 22 March 1957

1. Reference is made to telephone discussions 20 May 1957, between your office and Capt Crenshaw of this office, regarding the status of this case. As a result of these discussions, a further clarification is required.

2. This case, which has been given some attention by the press, is threatening to give the Air Force some adverse publicity through the indirect efforts of the publicity-conscious witnesses of the reported UFO sighting. Consequently, the A-2 and A-Z respectively, demanding all information and reports resulting from our investigations and under search.

3. In compliance with your instructions for providing Headquarters USAF with all case material, in anticipation of any queries from either the press or higher echelons, the following information is furnished. The incident reportedly occurred at approximately 2150 hours, 22 March 1957, as observed by military and civilian personnel in the Oxnard area. Investigations also involved action by both USAF and Navy aircraft. As such, the investigations may be considered as a joint operation.

ATIC 0-06, 22 May 57, ATOIN-XL, SUBJ: Report on Oxnard UFO Case - 22 March 1957
A. This investigation is suggested as a result of a recent inquiry received by the Director from a private individual concerning an alleged UFO sighting in the Oxnard, California, area on 22 March 1957. The director's interest in such a case is understandable, since the Air Force's position on the publicity and evaluation of UFO reports is well known.
B. The report is an Air Force investigation (reference above) which substantiates the claim of the observer and indicates that a possible conventional explanation or identification of the object cannot be made at this time. Since the committee must come from Headquarters USAF, accordingly, it is the opinion of the Director that any further inquiry or investigation of this case should be over the signature of higher level, possibly the Office of Information Services.
6. In conclusion, it is the opinion of this Center that this case was improperly handled at its inception, and the unfortunate train of events which followed to give the observation undue prominence could have been avoided. The unit initially receiving the report should have contacted the nearby Air Base unit which was responsible for UFO investigations, instead of the local police and other civil authorities.

The text in the document is as follows:

(1) A person was located in a field under the area of the reported sighting, but lights were found installed on each corner of the field.
(2) Detailed line-of-sight plots from the source's observing point were made, between the source's observing point and the objects observed. The objects' movements and apparent size do not merit further mention. The results of interplay of light on the insulators is obvious.
(3) Directly in the line-of-sight, as pointed out by source, and beyond, the higher-ups on the project were a very cold student who expressed disbelief, suggesting the sighting was the result of testimony from a professional astronomer in a local educational institute.
(4) The sighting was observed through a window. Again, the appearance of the red lights on the barn, the brightness, the triangular shape of the lighted area, the shape of the wires and insulators require no further comment.
(5) It is interesting to note that the objects reported were observed over two hours, with apparently very little movement. Yet, no report of any unusual occurrence was received.

This report is typical of the many received by the Air Force, which upon investigation is identified as conventional objects of known phenomena. The source of the sighting cannot be publicly identified, but the report shows that no further investigation is deemed necessary.

On the basis of the above, any attempt to attribute sinister overtones or imply meanings from the sky in connection with this incident is, in our opinion, totally unwarranted and not supported by the facts. This incident, if promptly reported, is a fact not often known to the general public.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

THE CONTENTS OF THE DOCUMENT:

The statement of Captain E. May, USAF, about a sighting on 6 January 1957 near Oxnard, California. The report describes an object observed by the pilot and crew of an F-84 aircraft. The object was described as circular, grey-white in color, and estimated to be 30-40 feet in diameter. It was observed for several minutes before disappearing suddenly. The report mentions that the incident was investigated by the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron, whose headquarters are in Dayton, Ohio.

The report also mentions the case of the President's Air Force Aide, who reportedly saw a similar object while on a flight in 1952. It states that NICAP (the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) has received information on several other sightings from military and civilian sources.

The report concludes by stating that the first sighting on the night of January 25, 1957 near the Pacific coast was the latest in a series of unidentified aerial phenomena observed in the area in recent months.

FOUR SAUCERS OVER CALIFORNIA AT SPEEDS UP TO 3,600 M.P.H. REVEALED IN RADAR REPORT COMPILED BY NICAP BOARD MEMBERS
Based on Information Supplied by Official Sources, NICAP Headquarters, Washington, D.C.
INVESTIGATION BY NICAP BOARD OF GOVERNORS
A further report has been received on the radar observation of four saucer-shaped objects over California in April 1952, disclosed in the report published in the April and May issues of the NICAP bulletin (Vol. 1, Nos. 2 & 3). This report is based on official data compiled from the Air Force's own records by members of the NICAP Board of Governors.
The sightings occurred on April 22 and May 18, 1952 near Oxnard, California. The objects were detected by radar and tracked by a permanent ground installation at the Oxnard Air Force Base for considerable periods of time. Their speeds were determined to be as high as 3,600 m.p.h., far exceeding the top speeds of any known aircraft.
"The saucers were picked up on radar, tracked, timed and their speeds determined," the report states. "For approximately 20 minutes on April 22, 1952, four disc-shaped objects were tracked maintaining an average speed of 1,200 m.p.h. On May 18, 1952, four similar objects were tracked for about 40 minutes, reaching speeds up to 3,600 m.p.h."
The objects were tracked on the Oxnard Air Force Base radar from 7:12 p.m. to 7:32 p.m. on April 22, and from 9:10 p.m. to 9:50 p.m. on May 18. Their flight paths were described as "erratic" and "incredible."
After the May sightings, the report states, the objects accelerated and disappeared off the scope. There was no air traffic control of any kind at that time, no known aircraft with such fantastic performance was in the area, and the objects showed no response to any efforts to communicate with them, such as visual or radio signals. The report concludes that these were Unidentified Flying Objects, not any known type of aircraft.

Lt. Col. Green:

I received a call from Capt. Gregory, UFO project Officer at ATIC on May 29, 1957 to report of a UFO sighting at Oxnard, Calif on 23 March at 11 P.M. Capt. Gregory phoned this report in because it has gained up considerable interest.

Brig. Fly here are the details:

1. A wife of an Air Force Officer observed an UFO near Channel Islands Harbor off-duty Coast Guard Station at Channel AFB.

2. The duty officer called the Air Police, Highway Patrol and local Sheriff all of whom conversed on Mrs.____ sighting which naturally attracted the newspapers and curiosity seekers.

3. A preliminary investigation by the AISS of Norton AFB discovered these facts:

a. Mrs.____ husband was on TDY and she was alone with a sick child.
b. Her house is located in an isolated area and in one of the heaviest travel air lanes in the U.S.
c. Upon investigation it was found that by looking in the direction that the object was supposed to have been visible, a combination of objects were seen. These were some low hanging clouds with a dim light coming through them which gave an appearance of a very bright star (arcturus), in addition, several aircraft passed the area with standard navigation and landing lights. It was determined that perhaps Mrs.____ being in an emotional state thought she had observed an UFO.

4. Capt. Gregory pointed out that the duty officer at Channel AFB did not follow the correct procedures for handling this UFO sighting. If he had, it would have been cleared up with out any publicity. The fact that he contacted the Air Police, Highway Patrol and Sheriff is instead of the proper channels created a situation that required quite a bit more explaining.

1. Attached for your information and whatever action deemed necessary, is a summary of the background of the case covered by NICAP Information Bulletin #10, which was a response to an article appearing in Look Magazine based upon an interview with Capt G.T. Carlston of the Oxnard Air Force Base.
2. Reference is made to a recent briefing given to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, as to this serious issue of which NICAP was apprised as a courtesy organized. The charges brought up against the Air Force regarding the Oxnard incident are considered unfounded as a result of his persistent inquiries to General Kelty and the Commander of Oxnard AFB, and the NCOIC investigation that was presented in some detail.
3. With respect to a radar report allegedly given by a CAA control tower operator while NICAP in receipt by the radar unit at Oxnard. However, is there the possibility of a more tangible evidence, the matter is obvious: the property of a member staff of a Government agency and confidential, which should be reported to the proper authorities.

Oxnard, California Case ( 16 Mar 1957 )
This case was somehow brought to the attention of numerous UFO clubs who besieged the Air Force demanding explanations. Keyhoe sent a 6-page telegram to ATIC.

Briefly, a woman living in a rather isolated area outside of Oxnard observed what she termed as "descending red and green lights" near her home. Hysterical with fear, she contacted the Duty Officer at the Oxnard AFB. The Duty Officer contacted the local fighter squadron. Two F-89s searched the area. Two Navy aircraft made a search. Nothing was found. During this period, the local police, state highway patrol, and the sheriff's office was contacted. All units converged on the area. A detailed intelligence report made as a result of the investigation disclosed that the source was a highly excitable, emotional person, a believer in saucers, and apparently left alone for the first time by her husband, an Air Force Captain, she became frightened at the lights. 

An analysis disclosed that the objects were red warning lights installed on a barn nearby, which, when observed through shiny glass insulators, or a telescope pole (in her line-of-sight) from her kitchen window did give the unusual appearance described. The play of automobile headlights on the insulators was emphasized in a telephone report to ATIC. Misidentification of conventional objects.

Text output from OCR:

The information is not invited in detail, and the following, which is considered to be appropriate, contains a group of general statements which are thought to represent the significant aspects of the case as it is known at this time.

1. The case, from the standpoint of basic significance to UFO investigations, appears to be a fairly routine case of an unidentified aerial phenomenon. Although the report indicates that the object changed direction and speed, this is not an unusual aspect, such changes being common in unexplained aerial sightings.

Your letters of 25 April 1957 addressed to the Commander of Oxnard Air Force Base, and 3 May 1957 to the Hdq. Air Defense Command, regarding a UFO recently reported near Oxnard, California has been referred to this headquarters.

It is the policy of the Air Force to answer all letters on the subject "contacts and/or the incidents, evidences or the nature of the matter."  We shall attempt to answer your questions and answers categorically. 

a. Radar units were operative during the entire period of the sightings. Any indications or incursions or unusual objects would have been immediately reported. Radar reports for the period in question indicated no unusual phenomenon.

b. Notwithstanding this, intercept action was ordered in the area. The two Air Force and two Navy aircraft found nothing, by radar or visually.

c. There are no classified reports regarding the pilot's findings. With respect to your letter of 9 May 1957 please be advised of the following:

a. We are certain that, with your journalistic and military experience and background, you are aware that the names of the individuals cannot be disclosed, nor can their statements be revealed without their permission.

b. Investigations were made not only by the Air Force, but by local police, highway patrol, and sheriff's units. These independently converged on the area reported, and also investigated the source's immediate surroundings.

c. Nothing unusual or sinister was found by these units. The following were disclosed, however:

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing a UFO sighting incident.

(1) A bare was located in a field under the area of the reported UFO. Red lights were found installed on each corner of the roof.

(2) Detailed line-of-sight photos from the sources observed the lights and confirm the sighting. There were three objects viewed through these crosses on 1.5-inch crossbars on the telescope, and the line-of-sight is obvious.

(3) Directly in the line-of-sight, as pointed out by source, and beyond the lights on the barn, was a very brightly star. Arcturus, in the sky. This was corroborated by a professional astronomer.

(4) The sighting was observed through a window. Again, the objects of the red lights on the barn with a reddish-orange appearing star in the background, observed through a mass of trees and shrubs to circumscribe no further comment.

(5) It is interesting to note that the objects reported were described as being very stable, very slow movement. Yet, no report of any unusual phenomena was received by others reporting.

This report is typical of the many received by the Air Force, which upon investigation results in the UFO observed being identified as conventional objects or natural phenomenon. We do not publish any details which may serve to indicate the thoroughness with which any UFO sighting is investigated, if properly reported, a fact not often known to the general public.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

FOUR SAUCERS OVER CALIFORNIA AT SPEEDS UP TO 3600 M.P.H. REVEALED IN RADAR REPORT

CERTIFIED BY MEMBERS OF THE NICAP BOARD OF GOVERNORS

"I certify I have seen the signed reports dated April 22 and May 15, 1957, describing these saucer-shaped objects as reported to at speeds up to 3600 m.p.h."

(Signed) Raymond Albert Keller, Robinson Memorial Church, Greenfield, Mass.

The report cited was signed by crew members of the U.S. Air Force Radar Station at Oxnard Air Force Base, California. On the night of March 23, the operators tracked four saucer-shaped objects traveling at speeds up to 3600 m.p.h. This incident is CLASSIFIED, NICAP investigation shows, since it raises serious technical and security problems.

Col. E. F. Curry, Jr., stated that no attempt has been plotted to the fact that these objects were tracked on radar, since the NICAP possession. The radar pictures taken that night are now CLASSIFIED, the reason given being that the Air Force wishes to withhold from public view any radar evidence which would confirm the reality of UFO's. 

VIEW BOARD OF SPECIAL ADVISERS

Important additions to the NICAP Board of Governors and its Panel of Special Advisers have just been announced.

YOUR SAUCERS (from Page 3)
Since the sighting included in the previous report by Mrs. Robert Bennewitz, wife of Sp. AF Technician stationed at Holloman, just after midnight, Mrs. Bennewitz had telephoned the base to report that she had observed a "brilliant, glowing red object" in the sky over Carisos Road Valley. . . .
Re-checking the CAA radar chart findings, it was found that the UFO seen by Mrs. Bennewitz and other witnesses had passed over the field at approximately 1:50 a.m. (According to this radar report, a letter signed by the Director, Office of Information Services, has been forwarded to USAF requesting copies of the Oxnard AFB under this case.
"This 'sighting'," he concludes, "was of saucers flying over there as on previous occasions...1:50 p.m. to mid- night."
For other USAF comment on this case, the Director's staff comments, "The U.S.A.F. is constantly reviewing the details of this radar report. A letter has been forwarded to the Director, Office of Information Services, USAF, requesting copies of the Oxnard AFB radar report."

FOUR MALES
Pilot observed to search the area he had
seen nothing, though airmen, police
and other ground observers clearly
saw the intense round objects which lighted
brilliant red light.
At least one of the four UFO's
observed by radar was almost directly
over Oxnard Air Force Base at this
time. (Operators' signed report included
the following account this matter which
will be called Operator 1).
The time was 2330 (11:50 p.m.).
With several other CAA men, Operator
1 was on duty in the Municipal Airport
control tower, Oxnard, California.
"We were watching the radar scope,"
he related. "Suddenly, we noticed
3 unidentified objects (about
the size of a basketball) moving northwest
at a speed estimated to be around
700 miles per hour. Moving in
a southeasterly direction at the same
speed and approaching the base were
3 more objects - the same size, speed,
and apparent characteristics as the first
3 that had passed over."
"I notified the base and the tower
operators' signed report will be included
This matter is most important
and mystery. Unidentified flying objects
that move at such incredible speed, stop,
and hover can be explained only by the
fact that they represent some sort of
'special' aircraft, unknown to us and
operating in our air space. This, I believe,
merits the most careful study and
investigation."

JULY 19, 1957
UFO SAUCERS from Page 4
SPECIAL REPORT OF UFO SIGHTING (southwest of Los Angeles). Between 0130 and 0430 hours (local time) of July 19, 1957, several UFOs were observed in the sky over Los Angeles, California. The sightings were made by many Californians in the vicinity. The eyewitnesses were able to identify the locality of the UFOs as the San Gabriel Valley.
The descriptions in the area indicate that probably several thousand persons observed the UFOs. During the latter part of our observation, Air Force officials arrived to investigate the incident. According to a statement given to Hess (background by the Project Silver) - Captain Josef C. P. , who was in command of the Oxnard Air Force Base control tower at the time, verified that the UFOs were picked up on radar, at a distance of 2310 (11:10 p.m.) and at a height of 7700 feet.
The above mentioned Captain Fry notified Air Force Headquarters, Washington (2330 & 2334 hours) of the sighting. Captain Fry declared to the tower that the UFO was completely strange, unfamiliar with any known aircraft. When the objects were observed, they made a distinct sizzling or buzzing sound, and appeared to give off a pulsing light. It was further stated that the objects would often change direction abruptly at high speed, something not possible with any known aircraft.
The Air Force, Filter Center, was less Wagner, whose regular job is that of a civilian dispatcher at the Oxnard Air Force Base. According to Mrs. Brentnall's statement, the UFOs were estimated to be twice the size of a standard aircraft. They were observed flying at an altitude of about 7700 feet. According to the details given, there were two or more objects observed at the same time, flying in close formation, and that the combined observation period was more than one hour. The two men admittedly were in command of the Oxnard AFB control tower when the sighting took place.
Near midnight, the shapes of UFOs seemed to exhibit two distinctive parts. It was noted that the objects emitted a distinct flashing light at intervals. Even while stationary, all these visual reports may have indicated activities or maneuvers of varying speeds of the unidentified objects observed.

Once the Air Force is in that case, either on a Navy, an Army general, nor even a ranking member of the Air Force, authorised staff can prove that he has been without interviewed. From the foregoing, it appears that the 0%?!° information, it appears that highly important facts about the March 23 Collision at Oxnard AEB are still being suppressed by NICAP. This case is still being investigated by NICAP, and a complete critique by NICAP's Special Advisors is not yet possible without the report of the 602 CIC Squadron.

On April 25, NICAP wrote to the Sheriff of Ventura County, California, and requested that the details concerning the return of certain material that had been taken from the Oxnard AFB be furnished. To date, there has been no reply.

AF Sheriffs also state: On the same date, NICAP also wrote to the Sheriff of Ventura County, California, and requested that the details concerning the return of certain material that had been taken from the Oxnard AFB be furnished. To date, there has been no reply.

Your letters of 25 April 1957 addressed to the Commander of Air Force Base, and 6 May 1957 to the second in command, Air Force Base, have been referred to this headquarters.

It is the policy of the Air Force to answer all letters on the subject, regardless of the intent, motive or objectives of the writer. With respect to your questions, the following information is categorically:

1. Any indications of unusual or unknown objects would have been immediately reported to radar reports for the period in question.
2. Extensive and specialized searches were made to cover the area. Two Navy aircraft were vectored to make a visual search over the area.

There are no directives forbidding the public's knowledge of the Pilot's findings.

With respect to your letter of 6 May 1957 please be advised of the following:

(1) A barn was located in a field under the area of the reported UFO. No clearance lights were found installed on the barn or the roof.

The text appears to be a response from the U.S. Air Force regarding an investigation into a reported UFO sighting. It discusses the Air Force's policy of responding to all UFO-related inquiries and provides details about the specific investigation described in the letters referred to in the document.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document.

Detailed line-of-sight plots from the source's observing point and plans of the lights as seen are appended. These give a definite track of the object. Two of the red lights on the barn were viewed through the cross-hatching. It is possible that there may have been some distortion of light on the cross-bar insulation, from random motions. 

Directly in the line-of-sight, as pointed out by source, was a very distinct star. This was seen as very bright star, apparently in the sky. This was corroborated by a professional astronomer.

The sighting was observed through a window. The appearance of the red lights on the barn, with a bright-green star in the background, is illuminated possibly by unusual light effects.

It is interesting to note that the objects reported were observed for about two hours with apparently very little movement. Yet, no report of any unusual phenomena was received prior or subsequent to this observation reporting the UFO.

This report is typical of the many received by the Air Force, which indicates substantial evidence or accuracy of the source`s report. In a number of cases the reliability, skill, experience, and personality of the observer are satisfactory. We are dealing with persons of unquestioned trustworthiness, education, and community reputation, who are sometimes so convinced as to place their signed observations at the disposal of the project.

This image appears to contain a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is marked "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top.

The text in the document appears to be a report about an investigation of a UFO sighting. The text discusses the details of the sighting, the analysis of the incident, and the conclusion of the investigation. There is no photograph included in this particular page.

Here is the full text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output it:

UNCLASSIFIED
MARCH 37, 1957, OXNARQ, CALIF. Subject Report on Observed UFO Cases - 27 March 1957.
The subject report was forwarded to this Headquarters by the District Informatio Officer at Oxnard AFB, California. The report states that on the evening of 27 March 1957, at approximately 2130 hours, an unidentified flying object was observed by several persons in the vicinity of Oxnard, California. The object was described as glowing red and moving erratically at a high rate of speed. It was last observed heading in a southwesterly direction. 
The purpose of the Air Force's investigation (in reference) was to determine as accurately as possible the identity and nature of the observed phenomenon. The investigation was conducted primarily to eliminate the possibility of the sighting being misidentification of a known celestial body or aircraft. Accordingly, it is the opinion of this Center that this case was probably a natural phenomenon, possibly a meteor or the moon, which was observed under unusual atmospheric conditions that imparted an unusual appearance or motion. The investigation did not reveal any evidence of a violation of our national security through the activity of foreign aircraft or missile systems.

ATTENTION PROJECT BLUE BOOK  
SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
OXNARD, CALIFORNIA, 3/6/57

An unidentified flying object was reportedly sighted over Oxnard, California on March 6, 1957. According to the report, the object was first observed at 7:55 p.m. and was seen for approximately three minutes. The object was described as a "brilliant light against a dark background" and was estimated to be about 20 miles away from the observers.

Further details provided in the report indicate that the object was seen by several witnesses, including a deputy sheriff, who reported that the object appeared to be larger than a conventional aircraft and was moving in an erratic manner. The report also mentions that the object was photographed, but it is not clear if any photographs are included with the document.

The report provides additional information about the investigation and responses from various authorities, including the Air Force and the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). However, the text in the document does not mention or describe any specific photographs.

Dear Colonel Harty:

As I am sure you are aware, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena has received many reports of unidentified flying objects. In attempting to evaluate these reports, we often find that classified or confidential information is necessary for a proper evaluation.

Therefore, I am requesting your cooperation in the following:
1. What is the classification of the report?
2. By whom was it classified?
3. Why was it classified?

Your assistance in providing this information will be greatly appreciated. We are most anxious to have as complete information as possible in order to make a thorough and impartial evaluation of the reports we receive.

Yours truly,
MAJOR DONALD E. KEYHOE, USMC (RET.)
Chairman

Regarding the Oxnard case, again it raises my personal question - - - did any of the many persons concerned have binoculars or a camera? This always seems to be the case!
The assumption you consulted apparently did not have a good starchard because while it is so that Arcturus was in the eastern sky yet south and altitude was striking, but far in the western skies it would be my opinion that the primary green object at or near zenith which seemed to come to a fair height by 8:30 p.m. still it is always difficult for me to understand, could it possibly cause so much contusion on the part of observers. It is unlikely there is anything more to say, it may have been misunderstood or confused. In this case seven police officers!
The trajectories or trails of the objects sighted certainly matched the diurnal paths of the star vesa and other stars showing some of the observers could ascribe fast motion and "speeding up" to this sighting. Your point is well taken, if these things move rapidly and speeded up, why were they in sight so long!
