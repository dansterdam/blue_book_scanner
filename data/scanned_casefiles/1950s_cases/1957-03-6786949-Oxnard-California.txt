             Education    High School plus 2½ years of accounting
             Qualifications    None

II.   RELIABILITY: SOURCE, wife of a UNITED STATES AIR FORCE captain who
was a Staff Judge Advocate, was very cooperative although seemingly concerned about
being ridiculed because of reporting the sighting. SOURCE seemed above average in
intelligence. SOURCE answered all questions unhesitatingly and without hesitation. Some-
times answers given were very general and not at all specific.    SOURCE reached con-
clusions quickly without a great deal of reasoning. SOURCE indicated that she was not
interested by a late reference.    SOURCE was positive she had seen something.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING AND EVENTS:

1.    At approximately 0715-½=2375 SOURCE arose from bed to answer the tele-
phone. While on the phone SOURCE observed an unusual green object in the northeast
sky at about ten (10) degrees above the horizon. The green object glowed fluor-
escently and was brighter than the surrounding stars.

2.    SOURCE described the object as being round, but changing shape occasionally
(see incl #2) to that resembling a helicopter. Object was estimated to be about
two and one half (2½) feet in diameter. SOURCE stated that at one time it appeared
to be about the size of a quarter held at arm's length and at another time stated
it appeared about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length. Object seemed
to throb and pulsate. There was no sound. Object was sharly defined. Object
alternately had and did not have a tail. A shiny aluminum-like pole appeared at
times on top of the object. Object was seen to move at great speed and also to
remain stationary. Sometimes it jumped around. The object gave off no smoke and
did not appear to change brightness.

3.    SOURCE described the glow from the object as projecting downward only.
SOURCE stated that the definitely flat and thin surface and compared the im-
pression of the flow to that created by blackout paint.

4.    At approximately 23/0725 MAR 57 SOURCE telephoned the Officer of the Day,
a personal friend, at OXNARD AFB and was told the sighting.

5. At about 23/0930z MAR 57 SOURCE observed two smaller red objects to the northwest of the green object and below the horizon formed by the LOS PASOS hills to the northwest. The observation point was a half mile east of the LOS PASOS hills. The red objects were aligned horizontally and seemed to be jumping around. One object was continuously behind some trees about 500 yards away from the observation post and in front of the LOS PASOS hills which were about one and a half miles away. At this time both the red object and the two (2) red objects seemed to dip around. Upon arrival of interceptors from CVEAE AFB the red objects again were seen above and away in a direction up and to the east.

6. SOURCE made these observations from the kitchen of her home and also from the back porch. No optical instruments were used during the sighting. See Incl 4.

STATEMENT

At about 11:15 P.M. 22 Mar. '57 Capt Linsley telephoned my home - I had just gone to bed. Answered MY phone which is so located in our kitchen that in using it I look out the kitchen window facing East. I told Capt. Linsley "I'm sure I'm seeing my first flying saucer. Really ____" - He hung up and I called Conway Air Base at Oxnard. Capt. Linsley's suggestion. I watched the original 'green' light and subsequently (sic) 2 red objects (1 thus) from 2 East windows until the green (sic) arrived. I took an azimuth on the 130 A.M. I talked on the phone most of the 2 hrs. interval to the O.D. at the Base - describing all the antics the green light performed and later the arrival of the 2 red lights. Sgt. (sic) arrived, talked on the phone - we all watched & looked until 3:30 AM, Mar 23, 1957.

PART TWO
SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS

1. 1st Lt Leonard E. Ott, Officer of the Day on the night of 22, 23 March 1957 at OXNARD AFB, CALIFORNIA, was contacted and a statement from him received. See Incl #2.

2. The 669th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron located on SANTA ROSA ISLAND, mailing address PORT HUENEME, CALIFORNIA, was contacted and the controller on duty on the night of 22, 23 MAR 57 furnished the following information. 1st Lt Donald R. Martin, two (2) years experience at the station, said that the station was operative during the entire time of sighting. Only one paint was noted at 0252, or five (5) hours before the sighting was reported. The paint was noted only once, held for five (5) minutes, then dropped. No other paint was recorded during the night although Lt Martin stated that this A & W site does not normally pay much attention to overland activity bearing in mind the proximity of heavy traffic. Vectored aircraft had reported no contact with the object.

3. A check with Base Operations, OXNARD AFB, disclosed the following: Two (2) F-89 type aircraft, OXNARD based, were returning from a flight in the OXNARD, CALIFORNIA, area at about 23/0302 MAR 57 when informed by the controller of the 669th AC & W Squadron at the objects in the CAMARILLO area, vectored to the area of the sighting. A search from one thousand (1000) feet on up was conducted. Aircraft returned and landed at base and no further action was taken.

4. A check with Detachment 9, 4th Weather Squadron at OXNARD AFB revealed the following:
[Wind table with altitudes and degrees]

Temperature at 23/0902 MAR 57 at the weather station was 43 degrees. Moonrise was at 23/0911E MAR 57. There was no cloud cover and visibility was unlimited. There was a shallow surface temperature inversion extending over one thousand (1000) feet.

5. Detachment 2, 1071st Ground Observer Corps, Pasadena Filter Center at PASADENA, CALIFORNIA, was contacted and the following information was received: The filter center received a telephone call from an Airman Delaney, an Aircraftsman, at the main gate at OXNARD AFB, reporting the object in the CAMARILLO area. Airman Delaney did not see the object and was simply making the call at the request of the observer.

6. The observatories at MT WILSON and MT PALOMAR, CALIFORNIA, were contacted and a report of no unusual activity received.

7. Traffic Officer Robert E. Reed of the California Highway Patrol, VENTURA, CALIFORNIA, gave the following information: At approximately 23/0810Z MAR 57, he received a report from OXNARD AFB on the unusual sightings. Traffic Officer Danilo Chalif proceeded to the CHATILL area but was unable to contact anyone. Later on 23/0810Z MAR 57, he went beyond the LOS PASOS hills where they saw what they described as a few luminous spots moving at high altitude. The traffic officer then proceeded to the LAWTON Ranch and proceeded out to the field where they found a beacon station at VENTURA and a radar site. Upon checking, they found the SOURCE's home on Barbara Drive. Upon arrival of the MSQ interceptors in the area traffic officers Reed and Chalif were at the traffic officers (See below) attempting to vector the F-89 to a point in the immediate area of the observation point by flashing their spot lights. This was unsuccessful. During the entire time, the traffic officers Chalif were in the area they saw the objects in question simply as stars with only the normal movement of their rise in the eastern sky.

8. Traffic Officer Robert H. Winter and Traffic Officer James F. Wilson of the California Highway Patrol, VENTURA, CALIFORNIA, also received orders to investigate the sighting and also found the barn at the LAWTON Ranch at about 23/0420 MAR 57. They then proceeded to Barbara Drive arriving at 23/0915Z MAR 57. Traffic Officer Winter also participated in the unsuccessful attempt to vector the F-89 interceptors to the area by spot lights. They reported seeing nothing unusual. There was no unusual sound or movement. The night was extremely clear and cool. Traffic Officers Winter and Wilson were positive that there were only stars present and a little later the moon. They left the area at approximately 23/1000Z MAR 57.

9. Sgt Earl Watson of the California Highway Patrol, VENTURA, CALIFORNIA, was not available for interview but his superior, Captain Howard Marsh, of the California Highway Patrol, VENTURA, CALIFORNIA, had reviewed the report on the sighting from Sgt Watson, Captain Marsh confirmed the contents of the reports submitted by Traffic Officers Reed, Chalif, Watson and Winter.

10. Deputy Sheriff Nickel Rouce of the Ventura County Sheriff's Office was contacted and he submitted the following information: At 23/0757Z MAR 57 he arrived at SOURCE's residence. There was nothing unusual. He witnessed the objects in the eastern sky at their normal rate. He described the weather as extremely clear. Chilly, cloudless with the normal temperature at about 23/0500 MAR 57. There was a glow in the eastern sky from the North American Rocket time plant. At 23/1135Z MAR 57, but Deputy Rouce said there was a bright enough glow to affect the visibility to the northeast.

11. Mr. Beatty, astronomer at San Bernardino Valley College, SAN BERNARDINO, CALIFORNIA, applied the following astronomical information: A brief star chart (MSL) showed elevation during a reddish appearance, was also present in the northeastern sky just above the horizon at the time of the sighting. This information was taken from his files and the stars were not actually observed visually from the observatory during the period of the sighting.

STATEMENT

REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

22/23 March 1957

I received a report from Mrs. [redacted] (Captain [redacted] wife) at approximately 2320 hours 23 March 1957 that she had sighted an unidentified object in the sky due Northeast of her home on Barbara Drive in Camarillo.

I had no reason to question her veracity; however, I did joke with her for a few minutes as to want she had been thinking. She became most indignant, stating that a large green iridescent object approximately the size of a plastic cabin on a helicopter was orbiting and moving Northward of her home. She further stated that it seemed to be hovering over the North American plant at Simi.

I explained to her how temperature inversions can cause reflections and weird optical effects, and she conversation was terminated. Five minutes later, at approximately 2330 hours, I received another call from Mrs. [redacted]. This time she stated that two red lights and green light were coming past it horizontally at tremendous velocities.

I then called ART and asked if they were painting anything in that particular area. Lt Martin (Director at ART) reported affirmatively that they had a stationary object in an approximately 20 mile area testmapped by Mrs Beauclaire. He stated that it was not a normal stationary object.

I then called [redacted] and asked if she still saw the object. She stated that the green object was now moving high (she swished her degrees off the horizontal due Northeast). At this time, she became very frightened, stating that the two red objects were on the deck and approaching very slowly. She asked that I call the local authorities and obtain help.

I was unable to contact the highway patrol due to some operator in the Oxnard exchange, so contacted the Ventura County Sheriff's office instead. They had a car in the area, and contacted it by radio. The Deputy in the car reported that he had also sighted the object and contacted another unit in Camarillo. This unit also reported the same object.

In the meantime, the Sheriff's office contacted the Highway Patrol, who dispatched a vehicle to the area. I arranged a conference call between the Sheriff, the Highway Patrol, and myself. All routes within the sighting and converged on Mrs. [redacted] residence. The Highway Patrol reported a red object to a light was on a field on the Lewton Ranch and requested two more cars to help him investigate. This turned out to be a barn with red clearance lights on it.

The Sheriff's department, meantime, had a car at Mrs. [redacted] Deputy Sheriff Segura and Rauch (sic) confirmed Mrs. [redacted] report in every detail. The objects were 2 to 3 miles (sic) from ground, at an altitude of (sic) the horizon of about 20 degrees, and constantly changing altitude. The red objects were extremely low, and the green object extremely high. ART called and

stated that they h d a scramble underway and would ask the aircraft to check the area
upon their return.

AEF vectored the aircraft into the area and an attempt was made to orient them
from the ground of police at Mro and the aircraft. This was unsuccessful
and the aircraft had to return to base due to lack of fuel. ISLAND then called and
wanted a complete report, which I furnished them. They evidently had a report from
the OCC. Two Navy aircraft were scrambled and AEF turned control of them over to
the USAF. At 1800 hrs at the alert, another aircraft were vectored into the same
area, and then controlled by sight and sound by the group at Mro, relayed
over the radio at the alert center.

Although on several occasions (sic) the ground observers (sic) reported the
aircraft close to the objects, no contact was made by the air crews. It developed
at one time, though, that the objects accelerated vertically at tremendous velocities
when the aircraft approached them. The entire operation was broken off at approxi-
mately 0300 PST with no sightings from the air. First report then called AEF and gave
a description of the incident and objects as a formal report at the media.

PART THREE

CONTENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that this sighting was caused by stars and probable optical phenomena for the following reasons:

a. The presence of a temperature inversion during the time of sighting could possibly have reflected the red lights of the barn over the LOS AJOS Hills to the point of observation during the earlier portion of the sighting, which could explain the location of the objects below the horizon. It is probable that later on stars were confused for the original red light sightings.

b. Although SOURCE observed objects to be in movement, six (6) other people saw nothing to indicate the objects were anything other than stationary.

c. Although Lt Ott said in his statement that the 4602d AB & W Squadron was carrying a stationary paintpot in the APARICIO area at the time of the sighting, Lt Martin, the duty controller on the night of 22, 23 March 57, denied carrying a plot at this time.

d. A lack of ground radar contacts, plus the fact that neither airborne radar nor the communications of the F-89 interceptors saw anything, would probably rule out any known object being in the area.

e. The presence of three (3) bright stars in the northeastern sky at the time of the sighting was confirmed by an astronomer.

f. The correlation of the number of objects originally reported by the SOURCE to the "other" of the Day at OXNARD AFB and the number reported to the Investigator during the interview lends credence to the fact that the SOURCE was probably upset and confused during the sighting.

COMMENTS OF THE APPROVING OFFICER:

Concur with Reporting Officer that this sighting was caused by stars. It is felt that the radar paint, in no way, is connected to the visual sighting. Therefore, the evaluation of the Approving Officer is "Was A1-anomal."

1. The objects sighted over Arkansas City, Kansas on the night of 16 July 1956 were reported to have been investigated by a B-47. Two crew reported the objects were seen in the area of Udall, Kansas.

2. The objects sighted over Camarillo, California, toward ATC areas, on the night of 22 and early morning 23 March 1957, were reportedly three objects. These pointed out the 11 mile highway patrol, and two witnesses, when about 16 miles from Camarillo, saw the objects. Their report was that the objects were in a southwesterly direction. Three was also a beam with four red lights on 16 northwest of Camarillo. This sighting was attributed to the stars, the four red lights, and light reflecting off of some luminous or hazy telephone cable.

2. This case, which has been given some attention by the press, is threatening to give the Air Force some adverse publicity through the indirect efforts of the National Advisory Committee on Aerial Phenomena. Attached are two letters from this committee addressed to the Commander of Conard AFB and the NCCAI AISS, Headquarters AXC respectively, demanding all information and reports resulting from our investigations and radar search. The allegations are not supported by the facts.

In compliance with your instructions for providing Headquarters USAF with all case material, in anticipation of any queries from either the press or higher levels, attached are complete data on the incident. Not included in the detailed report of the investigation, which was submitted to Headquarters USAF under AF 112, IR-16-UPOB-1-57, dated 5 April 1957. Investigations also involved local police, state highway patrol, sheriff's office, radar units and intercept action by both USAF and Navy aircraft. As such, the investigations may be considered thorough.

Here is the text from the document:

(1) A barn was located in a field under the area of the reported UFOs. Red lights were found installed on each corner of the barn.

(2) Detailed line-of-sight plots from the source's observing point were made. Between the source's observing point and the object, was a shiny pole with three cross-bears. The objects were viewed through these cross-bears. The results of interplay of light on the insulators is obvious.

(3) Directly in the line-of-sight, as pointed out by source, and beyond the lights on the barn, was a very bright star, Arcturus, in the sky. This was corroborated by a professional astronomer in a local educational institute.

(4) The sighting was observed through a window. Again, the appearance of the red lights on the barn, with a bright-green appearing star in the background, observed through a maze of wires and insulators require no further comment.

(5) It is interesting to note that the objects reported were observed for over two hours, with apparently very little movement. Yet, no report of any unusual phenomena was received by other than the source reporting.

This report is typical of the many received by the Air Force, which upon investigation results in the UFO observed being identified as conventional objects or known phenomena. We, of course, cannot publicly comment on an important factor in any investigation, the source, their reliability, belief, emotional state, personality or character.

On the basis of the above, any attempt to attribute sinister overtones or imply menaces from the sky in connection with this incident is, in our opinion, totally unwarranted and not supported by the facts. This case does serve to indicate the thoroughness with which any UFO sighting is investigated, if promptly reported, a fact not often known to the general public.

FOUR SAUCERS (from Page 1)

[Partial text at top of page is cut off]

...be Secretary's official information on UFO subjects. (Copy of telegram and related telexes with this issue).

In a letter to Representative Lee Metcalf, of Montana, Current replied that he learned that UFO reports were not without foundation, and that information was applied to the press in any existing which had drawn reaction.

On May 4, NICAP received the first report from the adjutant of the 4602d Air Defense Group at Oxnard, which stated that "the UFO's in question" were investigated by the 4602d Air Intelligence Group, Squadron, (this squadron, which has headquarters at March Air Defense, Riverside, California). 

The team which investigated the occurrence came from Norton AFB (California). NICAP letter to the 4602d, or Emmons, as official communication to Major John D. Taylor, Jr.

Current Air Force policy, Major Tyler stated, "is that the issuance of such information is you request it only by Headquarters, United States Air Force. Therefore, the letter to the Commander, 4142d Air Group was forwarded, through Headquarters, USAF, to Headquarters, USAF, (most to the 1602d for the record)."

After waiting eight days for word from the source, NICAP telegraphed Major John D. Taylor, Jr., Director of Legislative Liaison, who for several years has been working over Dewey (about 5 miles southwest of Los Angeles). Between 10:30 and midnight, several UFO reports were made by many California observers in Los Angeles, Pasadena, and throughout the San Gabriel Valley.

Police switchboards in the area were flooded with hundreds of calls, indicating that probably several hundred people saw at least one UFO.

During the later part of this period, both official and civilian reports poured into the Pasadena Filter Center.

According to a statement given to NICAP Headquarters by the Filter Center (P.O. Box 1068) Pasadena, the official report came in at 11:30 p.m. at which time Captain Fry notified Air Defense.

The first sighting on the night of March 23, or at least the first one listed, came from K. E. Jellerson, a Pasadena resident. At 9:55, Mr. Jellerson saw a brilliant, flashing object...

Lt. Col Green,

I received a call from Capt. Gregory UFO project Officer at ATIC on May 20, 1957 re report of a UFO sighting at Oxnard, Calif on 23 March at 11 P.M. Capt. Gregory phoned this report in because it has stirred up considerable interest.

Briefly here are the details:

1. A wife of an Air Force Officer a Mrs. sighted an UFO near Oxnard Calif and called the duty officer at Oxnard AFB.

2. The duty officer called the Air Police, Highway Patrol and local Sherriff all of whom converged on Mrs. home which naturally attracted the newspapers and curiosity seekers.

3. A preliminary investigation by the AISS of Norton AFB discovered these facts:

   a. Mrs. husband was on TDY and she was alone with a sick child.

   b. Her house is located in an isolated area and in one of the heaviest traveled air traffic areas in the U.S.

   c. Upon investigation it was found that by looking in the direction that this object was supposed to have been visible a combination of objects were seen to confirm with the description given by Mrs. They were a huge barn with two red lights, a small telegraph pole with 3 cross bars, a very bright star (Venus), in addition, several aircraft passed the area with standard red and green lights. It was determined that perhaps Mrs. being in an emotional state thought she had observed an UFO.

4. Capt. Gregory pointed out that the duty officer at Oxnard AFB did not follow the correct procedures for handling this UFO sighting, if he had it would have been cleared up without any publicity. The fact that he contacted the Air Police, Highway Patrol and Sherriff instead of the AISS at Norton AFB was against regulation. This is being investigated and a report will be made later as well as a further report on this sighting.

It also might be noted that Keyhoe has written several letters to ATIC about this.

SUBJECT: False Charges by NICAP Regarding Air Force Findings on Oxnard and Other Cases

TO: AFOIN-X1, Major Byrnes
FROM: AFOIN-4
DATE: 1 OCT 1957
COMMENT NO. 1

COMMENTS (Use reverse, if necessary):

1. Attached for your information and whatever action deemed necessary, is a pre-release of the first report by the National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the outstanding critic and detractor of the Air Force regarding UFOs. Reference is made to a recent briefing given to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, in which the serious nature of NICAP as a cleverly organized instrument of rabble rousing and agitation, was presented in some detail.

2. Attention is invited to first page of the report. The charges leveled against the Air Force regarding the Oxnard incident are detailed. Separate false. The result of the Air Force's investigations and findings were given to [redacted], as a result of his persistent queries to General Kelly and the Commander of Oxnard AFB. See attached copies.

3. With respect to a radar report allegedly given by a CAA control tower operator at MCAF, in rebuttal by the radar unit at Oxnard. However, the seriousness of the matter is obvious: the propriety of a member of a government agency voluntarily submitting radar reports to an unofficial, biased organization. Possibly, this should be reported to the proper authorities.

6. Oxnard, California Case ( 23 Mar 1957)

This case was somehow brought to the attention of numerous UFO clubs who besieged the Air Force demanding explanations. Kayhoe sent a 6-page telegram to ATIC.

Briefly, a woman living in a rather isolated area outside of Oxnard observed what she termed as 'meshing red and green lights' near her home. Hysterical with fear she contacted the Duty Officer at the Oxnard AFB. The Duty Officer contacted the local fighter squadron. Two F-89s searched the area. Two Navy aircraft made a search. Nothing was found. During this period, the local police, state highway patrol and the sheriff's office was contacted. All units converged on the area. A detailed intelligence report made as result of the investigations disclosed that the source was a highly excitable, emotional person, a believer in saucers, and apparently left alone for the first time by her husband, an Air Force Captain, she became frightened at the lights.

An analysis disclosed that the objects were red warning lights installed on a barn nearby, which, when observed through shiny glass insulators, of a telephone pole (in her line-of-sight) from her kitchen window did give the unusual appearance described. The play of automobile headlights on the insulators was emphasized in a telephone report to ATIC. Misidentification of conventional objects.

(Suggested Reply to Correspondence from National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena)
Dated 25 April and 10 May 1957)

National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena
1536 Connecticut, N.W.
Washington 5, D.C.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your letters of 25 April 1957 addressed to the Commander of Oxnard Air Force Base, and 8 May 1957 to the 4602d AISS, Air Defense Command, regarding a UFO recently reported near Oxnard, California has been referred to this Headquarters.

It is the policy of the Air Force to answer all letters on the subject, regardless of the intent, motives or objectives of the writer. We shall attempt to answer your questions and answers categorically, beginning with your letter of 25 April.

a. Radar units were operative during the entire period of the sighting. Any indications of unusual or unknown objects would have been immediately reported. Radar reports for the period in question indicated no unusual unknown phenomena.

b. Notwithstanding this, intercept action was ordered in the area in question. The two Air Force and two Navy aircraft found nothing, by radar or visually.

c. There are no classified reports regarding the pilot's findings.

With respect to your letter of 8 May 1957 please be advised of the following:

a. We are certain that, with your journalistic and military experience and background, you are aware that the names of sources, witnesses and principals cannot be disclosed, nor can their statements be revealed without their permission.

b. Investigations were made not only by the Air Force, but by local police, highway patrol, and sheriff's units. These independently converged on the area reported, and also investigated the source's immediate grounds.

c. Nothing unusual or sinister was found by these units. The following were disclosed, however:

The report cited was signed by one of four control-tower operators in the
Civil Aeronautics Administration, all of whom tracked the four saucers at a
large California airport. Since this case is directly linked with the strategy
(UFO sighting) at Oxnard Air Force Base, near midnight March 23, the operators
will not be identified. However, NICAP emphasizes that no violation of
security is involved, since there was no CIRVIS message (a report automatic-
ally classified under JANAP 146), Joint Chiefs & Staff instruction.

Four flying saucers, clocked over California at 300 mph, were tracked
by Civil Aeronautics control tower operators on the night of March 23,
according to a signed report now in NICAP's possession. The radar in-
port casts new light on visual sightings at Oxnard Air Force Base — at
the same hours that night.

At the time, the C.O. at Oxnard, Col. E. F. Carey, Jr., stated that no
UFO's had been picked up by his base radar. He also said that a jet

(Rest of text continues from previous page)... included was a statement by Mrs. Robert Beaudoin, wife of an AF captain stationed at the base. Last after midnight, Mrs. Beaudoin had telephoned the base to report what she described as a "flashing red object" in the sky over Santa Rosa Valley.

Re-checking the CAA radar observations, Operator I found that the UFO seen by Mrs. Beaudoin and other witnesses was one that had been tracked.

"This 'sighting'," he concluded, "was at exactly the same time as radar sighting — 11:50 pm to midnight."

Immediately after NICAP's receipt of this radar report, a letter signed by the Director was sent to Colonel Carey, requesting copies of the Onizuka AFB radar report and the report by the jet pilot. On May 4, NICAP received a message from the adjutant of the 4th Fighter Group at Onizuka, indicating that the UFO's in question were investigated by the Intelligence Service Squadron (this squadron, which has headquarters at Mather AFB, Defense Intelligence Agency, Colorado Springs, Colorado).

Investigative terms at all Air Defense bases, this would include Onizuka AFB, California.

A NICAP letter to the 460th, or Ent Field, brought an official answer signed by Major John D. Taylor, Jr., Adjutant.

"Current Air Force policy," Major Searle stated, "is that the issuance of such information as you request can be made only by Headquarters, United States Air Force. Therefore, your letter to the Commander, 4146th Fighter Group was forwarded, through channels, to Headquarters, USAF. Your letter of 8 May 1957 (a direct request to the 460th) likewise will also be forwarded to Headquarters, USAF."

After waiting eight days for word from the Pentagon, NICAP telephoned a new request to Maj. Gen. Joe W. Kelly, Director of Legislative Liaison, USAF, who for several years has been the Secretary's official spokesman on UFO subjects (Copy of telegram and detailed request shown elsewhere in this issue).

In a letter to Representative Lee Metcalf, of Montana, General Kelly had insisted that UFO reports were not withheld from the press, and that information was supplied to the press on any sighting which had drawn national attention.

Since the Onard AFB sighting had been covered by press-wire stories, in accordance with General Kelly's policy declaration to Congressman Metcalf, "to confirm to the Air Force policy, the NICAP request was made by the Director, who is also Editor of the UFO INVESTIGATOR.

To date, NICAP has received no answer to its two letters at the telegram to General Kelly. (A public attack on NICAP was made by an unnamed Air Force spokesman, three days after the wire to General Kelly, but this may have been only a coincidence. NICAP's only evidence is that General Kelly was involved in the matter, which is detailed in full, in the accompanying documentation).

Because of the obvious importance of the March 28 sightings, and the desire by the 3604 Intelligence Squadron's investigation report, NICAP believes that its members should be acquainted with all the facts, including the names of several witnesses who apparently have been silenced.

For details of the Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley reports, NICAP is indebted to Russ Leadabrand, columnist of the Pasadena Independent, who personally investigated the incidents, and who is Los Pitz, aviation writer of the Los Angeles Mirror-News. Mr. Pitz obtained additional information from a Ground Observer Corps identification expert, Lee Wagner, who has served as a volunteer with the Pasadena Air Filter Center for six years.

The first sighting on the night of March 28, as at first has been listed came from K.E. Jefferson, a Pasadena resident. At 9:55, Mr. Jefferson saw a brilliant, flashing object.

pilot ordered to search the area had
seen nothing, though airmen, police
and other ground observers clearly
saw a moving object which flashed a
brilliant red light.

At least one of the four UFO's
tracked by radar was almost directly
over Oxnard Air Force Base at this
time, according to the CAA control
tower operator's signed report. (In
the following account this radar expert
will be called Operator 1.)

The time was 2330 (11:30 p.m.)
With several other CAA men, Operator
1 was on duty in the Municipal Airport
control tower, Oxnard, California.
"I was watching the radar scope,"
his report continues, "when I noticed a
target ship of a moving object about
15 miles per hour and moving north-
ward. At first I thought it was a lot,
but I noticed it was moving much
faster than a lot. It had been mov-
ing about 15 miles when it came to an
abrupt stop and remained stationary.
Then three more targets appeared in
close proximity to the first one."

Operator 1 said the first target
came up at 50 miles. Our radar re-
cording shows the first target at 50
miles. Operator 1 continues: "This
object was moving in a southwesterly
direction and quickly called to other
tower personnel to watch this indica-
tion of UFOs.

At 2336 (11:36 p.m.) it left the
scope in the direction of the Naval
Air Station, but not before it had
been in close contact for 31 miles.
It moved at 3600 miles per hour (ac-
cording to our radar calculations).

Of fourth target, opposite to the
first one, the report continues: "It
was moving at 3600 miles per hour."
Our radar does not give the height of
altitude because our radar had to cut
10,000 feet or less, because our
radar's maximum height range is about
10,000 feet."

Next day, Operator 1 read a news-
paper account of the Oxnard Air Force

JULY 1957

FOUR SAUCERS from Page 4

Moving over Downey (about 5 miles southeast of Los Angeles). Between then time and midnight, similar UFO reports were made by many California cities in Los Angeles, Pasadena, and throughout the San Gabriel Valley.

Police switchboards in the area were flooded with hundreds of calls, with many probably several thousand. Some people saw at least one UFO, perhaps more. During the latter part of the period, both official and civilian reports poured into the Pasadena Air Filter Center.

According to a statement given to Russ Leadabrand by the Filter Center staff, Capt. Joseph Fry, the first officer on report came in at 11:10 p.m., at which time Captain Fry notified Air Defense region.

"Several" (11:10 p.m.) and 2350, said Capt. Fry, "we had many reports. We had reports that indicated the UFO was completely a bright white light. Some of the callers claimed they heard the "sound" of the UFO was compared to a "roar."

But most observers, including the Filter Center staff, described the object as showing a yellow-red light.

One of the men was Air Force T/Sgt. Dewey Crow, who is presently stationed at the Center. Until he saw the object, he was openly skeptical about UFO's.

The second Filter Center observer was Les Wagner, whose regular job is that of a Micro-Wave stabilizer in charge of the air-movement identification section. During his six years of GOC duty, Wagner has been an expert on aircraft identification.

While hundreds of people along the base tower from her home in Oxnard Heights, Mrs. Benson, who is familiar with aircraft types, positively described the UFO as a large, silent object, flashing a brilliant red light and maneuvering in the sky over Santa Rosa Valley.

F-89 Fails to Contact UFO

In rapid succession, other telephone calls — some from airmen attached to the base — confirmed Mrs. Beausoleil's report. Since the base already had an F-89 jet in the air, the tower radioed the pilot to intercept the UFO, if possible. (The F-89 carries, besides the pilot, a radar operator specially trained for this type of interception.)

According to the later report given to the press by Col. E. F. Carey, Jr., base commander, the F-89 crew was unable to make any contact, visual or radar. This attempted contact was timed at between midnight and 12:30.

But at approximately the same time (12:22 a.m.), several eye witnesses on the ground reported sighting a strangely flashing red object hovering near one of the Oxnard base runways.

The county deputy sheriff from the County Sheriff's office, Dick McElvany, confirmed the report.

Meanwhile, two policemen from Port Hueneme, also had sighted the source and made a report, which was relayed to the Oxnard tower.

(A somewhat later, a Navy Interceptor also joined in the search for the UFO, according to the United Press.)

From the times and details given, it is not certain that all visual reports concerned the same UFO. It appears that witnesses may have tracked two or more of the four UFO's tracked by the CAA control tower separately. It may be more objects were seen separately this could account for the varied reports of hovering, occasional movement, and weird maneuvers. However, all these visual reports may possibly concern a single object which maneuvered at varying speeds near Oxnard AFB and the surrounding area.

Balloon Ruled Out

When the UFO was first sighted by T/Sgt. Dewey Crow and Les Wagner, in Pasadena, its slow movement caused Wagner to check on the possibility of a balloon with a new type of light (the combined visual and radar reports, covering tremendous speeds and maneuvers, now appear to rule out any such answer completely).

Following a Weather Bureau suggestion, Wagner checked with the Atomic Energy Commission's test site in Nevada. The AEC stated the last balloon launching at the site had been on March 21, and the balloon had been accounted for. In addition, a spokesman pointed out, their balloons do not carry lights of any kind.

A second check, with Edwards Air Force Base, ruled out the weather balloon answer. No weather balloons carry red lights, Wagner was told. Also, the balloons launched in the preceding 48 hours lack beacon tracking to about 100,000 feet, where they automatically were destroyed.

Finally, the CAA also denied any connection with red-lighted balloons.

Following Air Force Regulation 200-2, on the reporting of UFO's, the Pasadena Filter Center after the first verified UFO report, immediately notified Air Defense Command HQ at Colorado Springs, the Air Technical Intelligence Center, the Directorate of Intelligence at the Pentagon and the nearest Air Defense base — Norton AFB, in San Bernardino. A team of Intelligence "Investigators" from the 4602d Squadron unit at Norton was at once sent to Oxnard AFB.

Though this is standard procedure, and is well known to the HQ staff at all Air Force bases, no mention of the 4602d was made when Russ Leadabrand, called the base at Norton. Major Thomas Bowers, Information Services Officer of the 27th Air Div. Continued on Page 10

FOUR SOURCES (from Page 29)

Again, they had received a number of civilian reports on the UFO. "They came from Los Angeles, and," he told Loesbrandt, "were you able to identify the observers."

"Negative," Bowers answered. "We were not able to pick up the object on radar. No Air Force personnel saw the object. (This corroborates the report by T/Sgt. Dewey Cron)." He added that a full report of the sighting was being sent to ATIC. "Major Bowers" failed to mention the swift on-the-spot investigation by a 4302 team from his own base may have no real significance, since the Oxnard AEB adjutant did not hesitate to inform NICAP of this fact.

But except for this official confirmation to NICAP and the subsequent confirmation sent to NICAP by the 4302 headquarters, no additional information has been released. Instead, several of the witnesses named have either refused to comment or have not been available to answer them from answering.

On April 25, NICAP wrote to Mr. Beaudoin and asked for details later mentioned on the sighting. To date, there has been no reply.

AF Silence Sheds More

On the same date, NICAP also wrote to the Sheriff of Ventura County, California, and requested that the deputies named: McKinley, Murphy and Conners, be permitted to forward all possible details, and also their personal opinions on their sighting. On May 15, NICAP received a reply from Sheriff William J. Synor, stating that all the information they had on this sighting was turned over to the officials of Oxnard Air Force Base. It was evident that he had been ordered to neither furnish the reports NICAP had requested, nor permit his men to be interviewed by a NICAP representative in Ventura.

"To cooperate in having these officials fully authorized interview by any military officer."

Suyler told NICAP as available for interview. Once the Air Force on its own, in order, neither an admin- in the Navy, an Army general, nor even a high-ranking Air Force officer could interview the deputies without approval by AF intelligence.

From the foregoing evidence, it appears that highly important facts about the March 29 California sightings are being withheld from the public. This case is still being investigated by NICAP, but a complete analysis by NICAP's Special Advisor is not possible without the report of the 4302 Intelligence Squadron, now at Air Force Headquarters.

Pending AF action on NICAP's request for this report, under the policy followed by General Kelly, anyone in the United States with authentic information or personal knowledge of the facts is free to report to NICAP - asking that it would be an actual solution of all mystery sightings.

Dear Colonel Carey:

As the Director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, I am writing you in regard to a UFO sighting near Oxnard Air Force Base on March 23. We have been reliably informed that four UFOs were tracked by radar in the area, monthly after midnight on March 23. The indicated speeds were as high as 3600 mph.

We also have been informed that an Air Force jet fighter pilot under your command was vectored to intercept the UFOs. It is later given that he was able to give this operations and intelligence officer a good look at the objects.

Dear Sir:

We have received a letter from the 414th Fighter Group, Oxnard Air Force Base, stating that our letter of April 25th had been forwarded to your office for action, since your Squadron investigated the UFO's involved.

In our letter to Commanding Officer at Oxnard Air Force Base we asked for copies of the pilot's report and the radar operator's report on the unidentified flying object sighted over the air base early on March 23rd. In addition, I should like to request at this time a copy of the investigation by the 4402 Air Intelligence Service Squadron. If this report is completed, in the event the report is not completed, will you please advise me when it will be available?

We should like to have a copy of this investigation of the various witnesses involved and any other information connected with this case.

As stated in our letter of April 25th, to the C.O. of Oxnard AFB, we herewith documentary evidence of radar confirmation of the visual sighting report.

I am making this request as a member of the press. I am editor of the NICAP magazine, published monthly at Washington, D.C., for the membership of this non-profit organization. In order that we may know when to schedule our story on this incident, will you please write me collect at the above address, giving the date when you expect to mail this information?

The National Investigations Committee was organized to collect, evaluate and publish authentic evidence on UFO's and we shall greatly appreciate the cooperation of the Air Defense Command and your Intelligence Squadron in particular in informing the public regarding these sightings. In return we shall be glad to cooperate in every way possible. Our policy, which was once the policy of the Air Force, is to make public all the information we secure except the names of witnesses who request that they not be identified.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Your letters of 25 April 1957 addressed to the Commander of Oxnard Air Force Base, and 8 May 1957 to the 4602nd Air Defense Command, regarding a UFO recently reported near Oxnard, California has been referred to this Headquarters.

It is the policy of the Air Force to answer all letters on the subject, general or the intent, active or objective of the writer. We shall attempt to answer your questions and answers categorically, beginning with your letter of 25 April:

a. Radar units were operative during the entire period of the sightings. Any indications of unusual or unknown objects could have been immediately reported. Radar reports for the period in question indicated so unusual unknown phenomena.

b. Two Air Force F-89's which were in the air at that time, were ordered to make a search-intercept over the area. Two Navy aircraft also made a search. Nothing was found, radar or visually.

c. There are no classified reports regarding the pilot's findings.

With respect to your Letter of 8 May 1957 please be advised of the following:

a. As you point out in your letter, the names of sources, witnesses and principals cannot be disclosed, nor can their statements be revealed without their permission.

b. Investigations were made not only by the Air Force, but by local police, highway patrol, and sheriff's units. These independently converged on the area reported, and also investigated the source's immediate grounds.

c. Nothing unusual was found by these units. The following were disclosed, however:

(1) A barn was located in a field under the area of the reported UFO. Red clearance lights were found installed on each corner of the roof.


- page 47 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(2) Detailed line-of-sight plots from the source's clearing point and the "unusual" green object, was a "shiny" telegraph pole with three cross bars. The green object, and two of the red lights on the barn, were viewed through cross-bars. It is possible that there may have been some interplay of light on the cross-bar insulators from random sources, such as auto headlights.

(3) Directly in the line-of-sight, as pointed out by source, and beyond the lights on the barn, was a very bright star, Arcturus, in the sky. This was corroborated by a professional astronomer in a local educational institute.

(4) The sighting was observed through a window. The appearance of the red lights on the barn, with a bright-green star in the background, as observed through telescope with views and insulators could conceivably produce unusual light effects.

(5) It is interesting to note that the objects reported were observed for over two hours, with apparently very little movement. Yet, no report of any unusual phenomena was received from other than the source reporting the UFO.

This report is typical of the many received by the Air Force, which upon investigation results in the UFO observed being identified as a conventional object or known phenomenon. We, of course, cannot comment on the report's veracity, nor can we, however, their reliability, beliefs, emotional state, personality or character.

On the basis of the known facts, this incident in our opinion totally unwarranted and not supported by the facts. This case does serve to indicate the thoroughness with which our UFO sighting is investigated, if properly reported, a fact not often known to the general public.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

[Note: Some parts of the text are faint or partially illegible, so I've transcribed what I can clearly read]

[Top section partially illegible, but begins with something about describing a UFO]

When the UFO was first sighted by
USAF, Clower and Las Vegans
in Pasadena, the object's movement
caused "wonder at the speed of the object" or a balloon with a new type of
light. The consensus: clearly, and
separately, a solid, metallic, guided
and maneuvered craft.

Following a Western Ballistics observation, Widmer checked with his Atomic
Energy Commission's field office in
Nevada. The AEC noted the local
balloon launching at the elapsed time
on March 11, and this eliminated that
possibility. In addition, a spokesman
was quoted out, that balloons do not
simply light up, stay bright, and move
as this object did.

A second check with Force Base, Allied, and local weather
station confirmed no balloon was aloft.
Also, that balloons in the Pasadena
area, 58 hours later, were tracked to
100,000 feet.

Here is the text from the document:

Regarding the Oxnard case, again I raise my perennial question
--- didn't any of the many people concerned have binoculars
or a camera? This always seems to be the case!

The astronomer you consulted apparently did not have a good
star chart because while it is so that Arcturus was in the
eastern sky, Castor and Pollux were certainly nowhere around
but far in the western skies! It would be my opinion that the
primary contender in this case was the star Vega, which at
that time was low, very low, on the northeastern horizon and
rose to a fair height by 3:30 a.m. Still it is always difficult
for me to understand how so obvious an object like a bright
star can possibly cause so much confusion on the part of
several people. If it were only one observer, then anything
can happen, but I am always amazed that people are so easily
confused, in this case seven police officers!

The trajectories or trails of objects sighted certainly
matched the diurnal paths of the star Vega and other stars in
its vicinity. This makes it all the harder to understand how
some of the observers could ascribe fast motion and "speeding
up" to this sighting. Your point is well taken, if these things
move rapidly and speeded up, why were they in sight so long!
