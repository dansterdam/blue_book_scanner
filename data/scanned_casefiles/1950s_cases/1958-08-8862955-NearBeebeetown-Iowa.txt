2. There are no elevations, azimuths, or directions of travel given.

Insuff. Partly pending further data

Glowing Light in Night Sky
Definitely Wasn't Satellite

A Lincoln resident and two Omahans reported seeing an unusual bright light in the sky about 3:30 a.m. Tuesday.

No explanation was apparent immediately. "It could not have been a satellite," said Lynn Augspurger, acting observer in charge of the Moorsatch station at Nebraska Wesleyan University at Lincoln.

The only remaining Russian satellite in the sky passed over the Lincoln area about 11 p.m. The American Explorer is passing over the area during the day, is not visible to ground observers, he said.

The Sputnik III will pass just west of Lincoln at 10:39 p.m. Wednesday and about 10:24 Thursday, he added.

Tuesday's reports came from:

[Redacted] Wesleyan watchman, who said he saw the object travelling southwest at 3:28 a.m. He said it was "bluish white, intensely brilliant oval with a very short follow-red tail, appearing to be about half the size of the moon."

[Redacted] who was reporting to work at the City Market, 511 South Eleventh Street, at about 3:30 a.m. He called it "a blue flame as big as a basket ball," travelling straight west.

[Redacted], who happened to be awake and glanced out a window, about 3:25 or 3:30. She said she had the impression of a "flash," then a glowing green object traveling north, then turning west. "It was bigger than a star," she said.

SUBJECT: UFO Incident in Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska

TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: AFCIN-4B4
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

1. Reference message from AFCIN-4B4 9-1994-3, 02/16/64 Sep 58.

2. M/Sgt Jerrol R. Clark, AF 1600933, of Detachment 2, 1706th AISS, Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri investigated this incident 4 Sep 58 with the following results:

a. The source, who formerly resided near Beebetown, Iowa, has subsequently moved to Colorado, phone [redacted], and was not interviewed. Her daughter, living in Beebetown, was interviewed but could add little to what was already known. Neither contact was very helpful. No knowledge of the object nor had they heard that one had been sighted.

b. Local residents spoke highly of [redacted] and were all of the opinion that she was a level-headed person and not of an excitable nature. The police of Missouri Valley, Iowa, about 7 miles northwest of Beebetown, had no knowledge of the sighting, nor did they know the source.

c. The attached sketch, inclosure 1, shows roughly the general area of Beebetown. According to Source's daughter, Mrs. Miller was not awakened by the light as the PM states, but rather that she was unable to sleep and was sitting up in bed. Most noticed light at point "X". It (the light) proceeded to point "Z" along the top of the hill "3" at a supposedly low altitude on a general northwest course. Southwest course. The interviewer could not ascertain if a sound accompanied the light nor if it actually disappeared behind the trees or disappeared in the distance.

3. Attached as inclosure 2 is a report of weather conditions at Offutt AFB on 12 August 1958.
