"Detroit Free Press" - 22 July 1950

"SHAPED LIKE A STONE - 6 Girls Report Seeing 'Something' in the Sky—Six Southfield Township Girl Scouts reported that while they were sitting about the campfire at Camp Begg Squawking Squaw at 10 p.m. Thursday they suddenly saw an awesome brilliance in the sky.

"Their Scout leaders, Mrs. Lewis Whitmarsh and Mrs. Virginia Stutsman, said they saw it, too.

"The girls said the terrifying radiance was shaped like a cigar or aeppelin. They said it roared toward them and broke in two. Then, they said, the two pieces rejoined.

"The girls are Tana Lopes, Claudette Moore, Bonnie Michaels, Doana Krangels and Beth and Carol Ann Whitmarsh, all in the 12-to-14 age group. 'I was scared,' said Tana. 'It was just like the sun at noon.' 'It was awfully exciting,' Claudette added. 'I thought it was coming right at me.'

"Mrs. Whitmarsh and Mrs. Stutsman said the girls ran for cover when it looked like the 'thing' was going to crash. They said it vanished as suddenly as it came.

"Neither the girls nor the leaders thought it looked much like what a flying saucer is supposed to look like.

"In nearby Franklin Village, Mrs. Dick Lewis and Mr. and Mrs. Russell Benton also reported seeing the radiance but could not attest to its stogie shape.

Mock Air Attacks
Start Rumors Of
Flying Saucers

SELFRIDGE FIELD, Mich., Aug. 1.—(UP)—The Air Force gave its explanation today to re-
ports of "huge bombers" launching "flying saucers" over Mich-

In answer to repeated reports of air-launched saucers, an Air
Force spokesman said they were really F-84 Saber jet fighters at-
tacking B-36 bombers in mock raids in Detroit.

He said the B-36's were "attacking" Detroit in routine training
missions. The jets were F-84 Thunderjets, the Air Force's latest jet interceptors, which
look like huge saucers because of their swept-back wings. They were from
Selfridge, Dearborn, Mich., and Chi-
cago, he said.
