Mrs. [redacted], of this city reported having sighted two flying objects at 10:45 hours on 20 July 1952 over Miami. These two objects were very bright, and "8'd in color relative to her position one was at 11:55 and the other at 11:35. The object at the 11:55 position rose slowly and then darted out of sight to the south at an extreme rate of speed. The second object hovered awhile, then moved in a semi-circular motion to the former position of the first one, and suddenly darted up and out of sight at a terrific rate of speed in the direction of North Miami Beach.

Mrs. [redacted] lives near the airport and is accustomed to observing aircraft, she also saw Healey's comet, and other astronomical phenomena, and states that she is convinced that the objects reported were neither meteor nor aircraft.
