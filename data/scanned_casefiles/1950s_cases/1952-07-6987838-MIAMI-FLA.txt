The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report describing an incident involving two flying objects observed by a resident of this city. The document states that the witness, Mrs. [redacted], saw two bright objects on the evening of July 15 around 10:15 pm. The objects were very bright and hovered for several minutes. The document also mentions that a second object appeared and suddenly darted up and out of sight at a terrific rate of speed. The document states that Mrs. [redacted] lives near the airport and is accustomed to observing aircraft, and she is convinced that the objects reported were neither meteors nor aircraft.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text from the document is as follows:

Mrs. , a resident of this city reported having sighted two flying objects at about 10:15 hours on last. These two objects were very bright and hovered for some minutes. Relative to her position one was at 115 and the other at 95 degrees. When they darted out of sight to the south as an extremely rapid rate, the second object appeared in the former position of the first one, and suddenly darted up and out of sight at a terrific rate of speed.

Mrs. lives near the airport and is accustomed to observing aircraft. She also saw several "comet-like" objects and other astronomical phenomena, and states that she is convinced that the objects reported were neither meteors nor aircraft.
