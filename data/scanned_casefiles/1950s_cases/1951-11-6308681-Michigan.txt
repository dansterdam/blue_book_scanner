Interrogation of Capital Airlines Pilot
24 November 1951 Incident

Mr. [redacted], Clearview, Illinois, Phone Clearview
was interrogated by Lt. E. J. Ruppelt on Sunday, 9 November 1951.

Mr. [redacted] was Captain on Capital Airlines Flight 394 on 24 November 1951. His co-pilot was [redacted] (first name unknown). The flight was enroute to Grand Rapids, Michigan, from Muskegon, Michigan.

At approximately 1835 EST (2325 Z) both pilots of the DC-3 noticed an object appear in the sky cross course between the 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions. The object seemed to be at their altitude, which was 1900 ft., and appeared to be between them and Grand Rapids, Michigan. They were over Coopersville, Michigan, at the time of sighting.

The object appeared to be 12 inches in diameter, round, "dull blue" light source with no tail or trail, and was comparatively bright. The trajectory was flat, if arched it was so little that it could not be detected. The object was viewed for 4 - 5 seconds until it disappeared in the distance. The course could not judge its horizontal angle through passage. Its appearance was noted due to its brightness. It was not noticed approaching from a great distance, but was noticed disappearing. The speed was judged to be "terrific", it was estimated at 1000 mph, but this was only a rough guess.

On landing at Grand Rapids, the pilot heard that the tower operators had also seen the object. He was interrogated over the phone by Air Defense people from Selfridge. He also heard that the tower had intercepted a message from a "net", (he could not give any more details on what net) saying that a radar site, whose location was classified, had picked up an unidentified return 20 miles east of the station and he assured that the message was very worrying him about over the phone. (Comment: This radar pick-up has never been heard of before and will be checked.)

Mr. [redacted] noted that while he and the co-pilot judged the object to have passed west of Grand Rapids, tower operators in Grand Rapids stated that it had been east of their location.

He noted that the night was very clear except for the usual slight haze, always found near Grand Rapids.

COMMENT: All during the conversation, it was apparent that Mr. [redacted] did not believe this was a meteor. He mentioned the possibility of an AF guided missile. It is apparent that if this is a meteor, it has no characteristics of a normal meteor. He stated that he had seen all kinds of meteors and had never seen anything like this before.

SECURITY INFORMATION

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

PROBLEM:
1. To advise the Director of Intelligence regarding details of unUsed Flying Object (s) at various points in Michigan on 24 Nov 51.

FACTS AND DISCUSSION:
2. The USAF Command Post received a notification on 24 Nov 51, that the 108th Command Post at Selfridge AFB, at 23502 to 23506, a 1 or 2 low and brilliant flying object(s) were over a road near Coopersville, Mich., with audible sound. Object was reported as having a red exhaust.

3. At 2334½, a senior captain pilot on Capital Airline Flight 64 sighted a similar object over Coopersville, Michigan. The airliner was traveling at an altitude of 1500 feet at the time of sighting. The object's altitude was estimated to be between 1000 and 1500 feet, and traveling at 1000 miles per hour, and proceeding in a southwesterly direction.

4. At 2336½, the [redacted] at City Airport, Grand Rapids, Mich., reported sighting a similar object. No additional information was available from this source.

5. The CIA detachment at Battle Creek also received a report, with no clear indication, from a private source of sightings near Battle Creek, in which a large object with a faint tail glow moving from north to south direction at an estimated altitude of four thousand feet, speed estimated to be over 450 miles per hour.

6. For an unexplained reason, Selfridge AFB radar ceased operation at 2324 on 24 Nov 51.

7. Upon further checking with the USAF Command Post and with 108 on 27 Nov 51, it was learned that a pilot of a 319 (number unknown) operating from Selfridge AFB was in the air in the vicinity of Coopersville, Michigan, at the time of the Capital Airline's sighting mentioned in paragraph 3 above.

8. This entire incident has been brought to the attention of ATIC and an early report of evaluation has been requested from them.

9. Subject matter will not be included in the Daily Staff Digest.

CONCLUSION:
10. None. For information only.

Municipal Airport, Chicago, Illinois, at 25/0002

Mr. [redacted], Capital Airliner pilot, was returning to his home
several blocks north of the airport when he noticed a "yellow orange oval object"
or light approaching the airport from the East. The object was estimated to be about
2500 feet above the ground and moving in a northwesterly direction at a speed "faster
than a jet." [redacted] was unable to observe the object carefully as he was at
that moment turning a corner in his automobile. He could make no estimate of the
size or shape of the object, but believed the orange color resembled exhaust flame.
His first impression was that it was a very fast moving aircraft with landing lights
on, however, the simultaneous appearance of an airplane with landing lights on ap-
peared so much dimmer and slower that he discarded this opinion. He was unable to
make a closer description of the object. The necessity of giving

General:

Check of 30th Air Division radar stations having radar coverage of the area
indicates no record of observation/reservation of the object.

Check with Military Flight Service indicates no known jet aircraft activity
in the areas concerned. Three F-86 aircraft out of O'Hare Field, Chicago, were under
Air Defense Direction Control on 24/2452 to 25/0015 in the Chicago area
and were alerted to watch for an unusual flying object, but gave a negative report
upon landing at 25/0500.

Check with Air Force installation at Minneapolis, Minnesota, indicates
General Foods Corporation there released only one experimental balloon on 24 November
which landed at 24/1301Z.

Check with Michigan University Observatory at Ann Arbor, Michigan, indicates
no meteors were observed during this period. In question for was aurora phenomenon
visible although the northern sky was reported as bright.

Appendix VIII
SOUTH MICHIGAN - 24 November 1951

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On the evening of 24 November 1951, several people observed an unidentified aerial object, from four sources in Southern Michigan. The object was observed in the SE quadrant traveling at speeds "much faster than a jet" at an apparently low altitude (below 500 ft. or 29 - 49 above the horizon) in all the observing area. The object was white, oval, and in one instance was noted to lose altitude just before it disappeared. No radar were heard by any of the observers. In each case the time the object was in sight was 50 to 50 seconds or less.

Additional information is given below and in enclosed overlay which shows aircraft track of object. It will be noted that there are only the constant tracks.

CAVU and exceptionally clear at all points of observation.

III. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION
The possibility of jet aircraft in the area, unidentified radar returns, and room meteoric or meteor phenomenon were studied with negative results. From the standpoint of an uncontrolled, to be sure, the observed object was a time span of five minutes between various sightings, but this could be due to errors in the witness of the observers. Assuming that the same object would be the next point in the area, the continuing of the investigation is recommended.

the altitude (i.e. appeared low), it is apparent that the object must have been a comparatively great distance from all the observers. The fact that the observers in Grand Rapids did not see the object in its wall can be explained by the fact that they were farther away from the object.

The actual flight path of the object was probably back over Ontario, Canada. It would probably be possible to determine the exact location is collective reference north or interpolations in Canada. It is not believed that it would be worth the effort, however, as it would not definitely identify the object unless it had been observed by competent astronomers.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

It is concluded that the object observed in Southern Michigan on 24 November 1951 was a large meteor-like object that probably passed over Ontario, Canada, or upper New York State.

On the night of November 21, 1951, there was a similar but somewhat similar sighting. It started when a CAA tower in Shen Michigan told the Air Force Flight Service that a huge whitish-white haze was seen at an extremely high altitude southwest at an extremely high altitude.

A few new CAA tower, from some sheriff's deputies, and others saw and reported a huge bright object. One, an experienced pilot, was certain it was a V2 type missile. All these observers estimated points were reported the thing "about four miles east."

I talked out to a very large motor passing over the New England states; we were 14 with experienced meteor observers at the time. I talked to a number of the witnesses later and they remained firm in their belief that they had seen a Something.

Appendix VIII
SOUTHERN MICHIGAN - 24 November 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT

On the evening of 24 November 1951, seven people observed an unidentified aerial object, from four separate locations in Southern Michigan. The object was observed in the S. quadrant traveling at an apparently low altitude (below 5,000 ft. or 2° - 4° above the horizon) in all the observations. The object traveled horizontal to the east and in one instance was noted to lose altitude just before it disappeared. No sonic or other heard by any of the observers. In each case the time the object was in sight was 5-6 seconds or less.

Additional information is given below and in enclosed overlay which shows apparent track of objects. It will be noted that these are only the apparent tracks.

II. WEATHER
CAVU and exceptionally clear at all points of observation.

III. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION
The possibility of jet aircraft in the area, unidentified radar returns, and known meteoric or aurora phenomenon were checked with negative results. From the reports, it is reasonable to assume that all the observers sighted the same object. There is a time span of five minutes between various sightings, but this could be due to errors in the watches of the observers. Assuming that the tower clock would be the most accurate, the time would be 1824 EST. From the occurrence of the object...

the altitude (i.e. appeared low). It is apparent that the object must have been
a comparatively great distance from all the observers. The fact that the observers
in Grand Rapids and over Coopersville did not observe a tail or trail can be ex-
plained by the fact that they were far from the object.

The actual flight path of the object was probably back over Ontario, Canada.
It would probably be possible to obtain the exact location, collecting, re-
norts or interpretations in Canada. It is not believed that it would be worth
the effort, however, as it would still not definitely identify the object unless
it had been observed by competent astronomers.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

It is concluded that the object observed in Southern Michigan on 24 November
1951 was a large meteor-like object that probably passed over Ontario, Canada, or
