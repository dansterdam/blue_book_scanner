Interrogation of Captain Airline Pilot - 24 November 1951
Mr. was interrogated by Lt. E. J. Ruppelt on 29 November 1951.
Mr. was Captain of Capital Airline Flight 124 on 24 November 1951. His co-pilot was . The flight was en route to Detroit, Michigan, from Richmond, Michigan.
At approximately 1335 EST (2335 Z) both pilots of the DC-3 noticed an object passing in the sky. The object seemed to be at their altitude, which was 1000 ft., and appeared to be at their airspeed. They were conversing with Detroit, who confirmed they had a target on their radar. The object passed in front of them and disappeared.
The object appeared to be 12 inches in diameter, round, "dullish blue" light source with no tail, or trail, and was comparatively bright. The object was visible for approximately 4-5 seconds until it disappeared in the distance. Its speed could not be estimated.
On landing at Grand Rapids, the pilot heard that the tower operators had also seen the object. He was interrogated and confirmed that the tower had intercepted a message from self-ridge, that the tower had picked up the object on their radar. (Comments: This radar pick-up has never been heard of before and will be investigated.)
Mr. noted that while he and the co-pilot judged the object to be at their altitude, it had been east of their location. He stated that the night was very clear except for the usual haze.
COMMENTS: All during the conversation, it was apparent that Mr. did not believe this was a meteor. He mentioned the possibility of an experimental missile. It is apparent that if this is a meteor, it has no characteristics of a normal meteor. It is apparent that he had seen all kinds of meteors and had never seen anything like this before.

UNCLASSIFIED

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, USAF

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

1. It is understood that the Director of Intelligence, USAF, has requested a report on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects, which have been observed in the vicinity of Detroit, Michigan, on 6 November 1951.

PAPER AND DISCUSSION

2. Mr. W.A. Command Post received a message at 2315 hours, 6 November 1951, that two objects described as brilliantly lit against the dark sky, moving at a rapid rate of speed, had been observed in the vicinity of Ann Arbor, Michigan.

3. At 2330, a senior captain pilot on Capital Airlines, who was flying at 8,000 feet, reported that he had sighted two objects at an altitude of 1,000 feet over the Detroit area, which appeared to be under intelligent control, in that they changed speed and direction in a manner which could not have been matched by any known type of aircraft. The pilot also stated that the objects appeared to be engaged in some kind of maneuver or pacing of the airliner.

4. The G.I. detachment at Battle Creek also received a report, with supporting radar observation, of objects maneuvering in the Detroit area which could not be identified as any known type of aircraft. The Director of Intelligence, USAF, was immediately notified, and the information was passed to ATIC for study and analysis.

5. For a more detailed record, reference is made to the airfield operation record and the pilot's report, copies of which are being forwarded to ATIC.

6. Upon further checking with the USAF Command Post and with ACC on 27 Nov 51, it was learned that a flight of F-94's (number unknown) containing two pilots, was scrambled from Selfridge Air Force Base to investigate the sightings in the Detroit area, but was unable to make visual contact with the objects.

MATERIEL COMMAND

Reference is made to a Project Grudge incident in southern Michigan on 21 November 1951, in which an unidentified object was sighted in widely separated locations.

In an attempt to obtain a more complete coverage of other possible sightings, it is proposed that additional matter be considered as possibly being related to (52) unidentified airborne objects.

Since this entails correspondence with newspapers about a subject that could possibly cause some inquiry from the newspapers, it is requested that handling of the letters and contents be considered upon.

The PIO of AMC will also be requested to concur on this proposal.

STATUS REPORT #2

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:

On 7 November 1951, two military observers saw an unidentified aerial object from four separate locations in southern Michigan. The object was observed traveling at a relatively low altitude (2,000 to 3,000 feet). The object was observed for approximately five minutes and during this time was tracked by radar. No sound was heard by any of the observers. In each case the observers lost sight of the object when it disappeared behind trees or buildings. 

Additional information is given below and is indicated with more data on location of sightings. It will be noted that these are only the incidents tracked.

II. DETAILS
CASE EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR AT ALL POINTS OF OBSERVATION.

III. ANALYSIS OF INVESTIGATION:
The possibility of jet aircraft in the area, identified radar returns, and the nature of the sightings indicates that all the observers observed the same object. Where and how this object was tracked and observed is consistent with an unidentified aerial craft or flying object.

the altitude (i.e., apparent low), it is apparent that the object must have been a comparatively great distance from all the observers. The fact that the observers were able to observe certain details over considerable distances indicates that the object must have been plainly visible to them during the observation.

The related flight path of the object was probably 3,000 to 4,000 miles per hour over the Windsor-Detroit area, Canada. It would probably be possible to determine the exact location if a collection of the reports over a period of several minutes could be obtained.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

It is concluded that the object observed in certain Michigan on 24 November 1951 was a large, meteor-like object but probably meteor or a satellite.

OCR output:

On the night of November 24, 1951, there was a definite indica- tion that a flying object with bluish-green lights was seen to fly over Washtenaw County, Michigan, according to a statement submitted by a Michigan field officer.   The object, he stated, was seen coming from the east and traveling at a high rate of speed, at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet or more, in a westerly direction. The object gave off a bluish-green light, and was observed for a period of approximately two or three minutes. It was also reported that in the area of Detroit, from a soldier on leave at Battle Creek, a similar experience was reported, apparently about the same time, and traveling in the same direction.   All those who reported the incident stated that the object seemed to be a jet propelled aircraft or some kind of unconventional aircraft. However, from the description given, it is evident that this was not a conventional aircraft, but rather some kind of unconventional aircraft or perhaps a flying saucer.   As this incident occurred during the period when much sighting and speculation was directed toward the so-called flying saucers, it is considered pertinent to include this report in this file.

SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT

On 6 november 1951, a people observed an unidentified aerial object from four separate locations in Southern Michigan. The object was first observed in the vicinity of Battle Creek and was apparently an elliptical-shaped object, yellow or white in color, about the size of a football. The object was observed through 10-power binoculars and was observed to be as fast as a jet aircraft and at the same time as maneuverable as a jet. Additional information is given below and in enclosed summary sheet.

Selfridge A.F.B. 1830 L. Elliptical White Red M 2-3 AF FTC
Battle Creek 18.5 L. Oval White White M 15-20 AF Pvt.
Grand Rapids 18.4 L. Round White None S. - Tower Operator
Coopersville 18.5 L. Round Bluish White None S. 30-40 Airline Crew (Airborne)

WEATHER: GAVU and exceptionally clear at all points of observation.

STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION:
The possibility of jet aircraft in the area, unidentified radar contacts, and known patterns of various activities in the area were considered in the investigation. There is a time span of five minutes between various sightings but this could be due to errors in the estimates of the observers. Additional investigation is continuing to determine if the sighter close would be the most accurate, the time would be 12:34 EST. From the estimates of the observers, the object was estimated to be about the size of a football at a distance of about one mile. Additional details are contained in the attached summary sheet.

the altitude (i.e. apprarni low), it is apparent that the object must have been a comparatively small distance from all the observers. The fact that the observers did not mention any definite silhouette or outline of the object tends to be explained by the fact that they were blinded by the intense light, and could not see the object distinctly.

The observed flight of the object was probably high over Ontario, Canada. It would probably be possible to determine the exact location, by checking the records of the Royal Canadian Air Force and the weather station that day.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
It is concluded that the object observed in Southern Michigan on 24 November 1951 was a large, incandescent object that probably passed over Ontario, Canada, but was seen by observers in several cities in Michigan or near the border.
