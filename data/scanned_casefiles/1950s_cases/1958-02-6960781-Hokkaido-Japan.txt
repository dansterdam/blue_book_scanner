10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Radar report from Sea of Japan area. Return developed rapidly to a dense cloud that expanded to cover an area approximately 55 miles long and rose from an altitude of 3,000 ft to 16,000ft. Return similar to weather return except for speed of development. Pilot aircraft in area turned toward the return and proceeded to the general area. Return resembled explosion of large munitions ship exploding.

11. COMMENTS
Rapid development and a/c reaction rule out weather phenomena and possible malfunction. Explosion possibly correlated with 1883-88 as explosion. Observed by fishermen. Also seismic detection of nuclear explosion reported from Matsushiro.

Entire Document:

While conducting surveillance of Russian aircraft on 19 Feb 58 at 0059z, operations personnel of AC&W Site #45 at Asoiwayama (GEOREF XJGF 3020) (Hokkaido) Japan observed the rapid development of an unusual radar return on PPS-2M(HRI) height finding radar (see incl 1). The radar return was from the area of 40°30 min north, latitude, 137°30 min east longitude (in GEOREF G1dQ) over the Sea of Japan approximately 80 nautical miles off the Russian Coast (Maritime).

The return developed to a dense cloud that expanded to cover an area approximately

65 miles long from 44°10 min north 137°10 min east and approximately 25 miles across which rose from an altitude of 3,000 feet to a final altitude of 46,000 feet. The return was similar to a weather return except for the speed of its development. It appeared at 0059 and dissipated at 0300z. All five Russian aircraft tracks in the area proceeded to the general vicinity of this phenomenon. Observers were unable to describe the return and associated Russian reaction. In terms of any previous experience, Observers stated that it most nearly resembled a very large explosion such as that of a very large ammunition ship. A weak low pressure area was located in the Sea of Japan approximately 12 north latitude. Winds at Site at 200,000 feet were from 260° at 50 knots, weather was CAVU. The above data was furnished by Capt Henry Kolb, Det 45 Operations Officer, who witnessed the event along with 1st Lt. Thomas V. Cole, Ass't Operations Officer and Mr. N. Tech Rep. on GEPPS-6, 3000 Comments Rapidity of development plus apparent Russian aircraft reaction would appear to rule out a natural weather phenomenon or a radar malfunction. Veracity of witnesses is not questioned. No intelligence personnel are assigned at Radar Site. Site 45 had no radar scope camera so a sketch of scope face was substituted. This report delayed due to late receipt in this Hq (26 Feb 58) and need for preparation of report on reproducible AF Form 112.

INFO SECT 05 rnd

1. The information contained in this report was obtained from Mr. Noboru ITO, Chief of the Aviation Administration Section and Mr. Isamu SAHARA, Chief of the No. 7 Security Section, MARITIME SAFETY BOARD, as reported to him by the Chief of the HOKKAIDO Coast.

2. This report contains information on three luminous sightings of unknown origin.

6004th AISS, visited Noboru ITO, Chief of the Aviation Administration Section and Toru SAHARA, Chief of the No. 2 Security Section, MARITIME SAFETY BOARD (MSA) for information on an alleged explosion off the SIBERIAN coast on 19 February 1958.

2. Recently, three unknown luminous sightings were made off the coast of HOKKAIDO by fishermen and reported to MSA. MSA has recorded these incidents but will not investigate the matter further. In each instance the sighting was made at night. There is no report indicating an explosion off the coast of SIBERIA on 19 February 1958.

3. At 1830 hours (JST) on 31 October 1957 fisherman observed a pillar of flame 100 m high, 1500 m west of NEMURO (44°43'N/145°E) for approximately 15 minutes. The color changed from red to blue, then disappeared.

4. At 2034 hours (JST) on 1 March 1958 fisherman observed a luminous body that disappeared after 10 minutes at an altitude of approximately 2,000 m in the direction of NORTHWEST POINT (44°15'N/145°E) on KUNASHIRI ISLAND. The color was not determined. At 2103 hours (JST) on the same day, a luminous body was observed rising gradually for about 20 minutes then disappearing near PADPAYA (ONNERUP) (45°45'N/148°E). The color was not certainly identified.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

    1. At approximately 0959 hours (JST) on 19 February 1958 an unknown
phenomenon was detected at a US radar site in JAPAN. The phenomenon lasted
approximately two hours. This office checked with the Meteorological Agency
for barometric and seismic data on the premise that an explosion was
detected. It was learned that there were no barometric or seismic changes
above time. Negative information was also obtained from the Explosion and
Air Staff Offices of the Defense Agency.

    2. Officials of the Meteorological Agency stated that any barometric
change could be detected at weather stations in JAPAN. The seismic detection
at the MATSUSHIRO SEISMOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY is believed to have been
instigated from the search for seismic detection of USSR nuclear explosion.)
