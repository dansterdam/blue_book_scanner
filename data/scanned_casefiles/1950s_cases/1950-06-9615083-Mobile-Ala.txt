Ball of Fire Seen
In Southern Skies
Object, Visible 500 Miles,
Quickly Burns Out

NEW ORLEANS, June 23 (UP). - A coal ball of fire visible for 500 miles burned for a few seconds high in the southern sky tonight and then glimmered out, leaving a curving trail of glowing vapor.

R. M. Kizer, senior air traffic controller of the Civil Aeronautics Administration here, said the gleaming object was seen from Tuscaloosa, Ala.; Houston, Tex. and a plane 250 miles southward over the Gulf of Mexico.

In Jackson, Miss., City Fireman Bert Kysar said: "It looked like a grapefruit and was spouting fire like a roman candle and was followed by a white vapor trail. It made a loop and then a white light came on."

J. A. Aruly, United States weather forecaster here, said he saw an object of "tremendous brilliance" in the western sky at 7:40 p. m. C. S. T. "It was more brilliant than any meteor I have ever seen," Mr. Arulo said. "It burned out in two or three seconds. It left a long, white smoke or vapor trail, which is something else I have never seen a meteor do."

1. Reference radio this Headquarters, dated 241800 CST, June 1950, 
(essentially restated in paragraph two below).

2. At 251940 CST June 1950, crew members flying a routine "Pelican" 
weather reconnaissance mission over the Gulf of Mexico noted what appeared 
to be a huge ball of fire falling in a spiral descent from a height of 
at least 50,000 feet. The accompanying brilliant light faded at 20,000 
feet. A bluish colored smoke or vapor trail followed the object and persisted for twenty minutes. The weather at the time was CA'VU with a few 
scattered thunderstorms on the horizon to the south and east. Estimated 
position of sighting 28° 48'N, 89° 48'W. Position of aircraft at time of 
sighting 27° 00' N, 86° 00'W.

3. Pertinent excerpts from crew member reports:

"I looked out and saw a flaming trail in the sky which was definitely not a falling star. As it fell it made a twisting trail a more 
or less the shape of an 'S'. It started at a height of 50,000 feet or 
over and faded out at around 20,000 feet. The flame, vapor, light or 
whatever it was, remained visible in the sky for around one half an hour."

"I noticed a bright streak in the sky off our left wing that 
appeared at first to be a falling flame. It grew greatly in brightness 
and also appeared to be in spirals. I believe it was at 
great height and distance. I observed same for fifteen minutes."

Here is the text from the document:

"A very bright zigzag path of light which appeared to extend from a base of 80 miles to a height of 50-70 miles. It remained visible for approximately 20-30 minutes, seeming to elongate itself in an upward motion, and then later coming to drive toward the earth."

Sgt.
Radio Operator

"At 1940 CST, 24 June 1950, flying on a routine Pelican at 10,000 feet, course about thirty degrees, ground speed 175 knots, position 26°50' N 86°05'W, a brilliant light was observed high in the sky, at what seemed a great distance at a relative bearing of about 80°. The light proceeded eastward at what seemed a slow rate and in a curving erratic path leaving an extremely bright glowing trail. After about a minute and a half the light disappeared but the trail continued to glow blue-white with line indicated willingness for another fifteen minutes after which it faded slowly to a soft blue and finally dissipated at about 2000 CST."

Appearance from Navigator's window.

"At this time the portion of the sky in which the phenomenon occurred had turned dark enough for most of the stars to be visible. Skies in the immediate vicinity were clear but a few thunder storms on the horizon, especially to the South and East, gave off intermittent flashes. (These flashes were quite yellowish in contrast to the blue-white glow of the observed light)."

A series of fairly accurate radio fixes were obtained which showed the aircraft at the following positions:

1940 CST - 26°50'N     86°06'W
1944 CST - 27°05'N     86°08'W     (Turned to heading of 326°)
2000 CST - 27°30'N     86°40'W

A series of visual bearings taken on the light trail during this period showed it to be over the vicinity of 26°48'N, 89°45'W.

Fireball In Sky Over City
Apparently Was Meteorite

Mobilians who saw that "ball eyes were deceiving them and first in the Western skies early Friday night and thought their wire services reported the phenomenon on being seen in Tuscaloosa, Fort Smith, Ark., and other points. There came from the testimony toward the reality of the big flash came from a National Air Lines pilot who was approaching Mobile at about 7:40 p.m.

DESCRIBES FLASH
The pilot, Capt. James L. Hansen, reported the brilliant flash and vapor trail to the Associated Press and United Press in Jacksonville, Fla., after he finished his flight.

Hansen described the scene as a meteor-like object in the sky over Mobile that left a vapor trail. He said it was traveling "at a tremendous speed." "I couldn't (Continued on Page Two)

(Continued from Page One)
estimate its altitude," Hansen said, "but it was high."

J. A. Bills of Rosedale, near Tuscaloosa, Ala., reported to the Civil Aeronautics Administration's communication station there that he saw an object Friday night that seemed to be an aircraft with a ball of fire following from it.

He reported he saw the fire "approximately 40 miles north of Tuscaloosa."

At Fort Smith, three fishermen witnessed the flash and vapor trail as they fished in a lake there. They said they witnessed the flash about 2 a.m. Saturday. It lasted several seconds and was followed by what sounded like an explosion.

BELIEVED METEORITE
Meanwhile, the minds of Mobilians were set at rest by Weatherman Bill Tilson who said the flash was evidently a meteorite sailing off its regular route and probably landed in the swamps of Louisiana.

Some Mobilians reported it as an explosion in the sky. Others said it looked like a speeding plane with the sun's fading red and gold rays playing tricks with its vapor trail.

A few Mobilians thought they were witnessing a flying saucer. Generally it was described as anything from a fiery ball to a streak in the Eastern skies. The vapor trail was visible in the sky for about a half-hour after the flash.

Plane Passengers
Watch "Saucer"
LOS ANGELES, June 21.—(AP)— United Airlines today disclosed that the largest flying saucer yet reported through the skies was seen by a crew of five and some 25 passengers.

First officer David Stewart of Redondo Beach, Calif., today told a news conference that his crew of five and some 25 passengers watched a brilliantly-glowing object speed through the skies at great speed last night.

Stewart said "the object was more disc-shaped than the previously reported pancake - shaped 'saucer'."

He said his ship was flying at 14,000 feet and that the object was traveling at about 14,000 feet and then faded into the distance. He estimated its speed faster than his plane's 250 miles per hour.

Paper's Photos Show 'Saucer' in Kentucky

Louisville, Ky. June 28 (U.P.)—
The Louisville Times printed pictures today of a "flying saucer" taken by one of its own photographers yesterday afternoon.

The pictures, taken by Staff Correspondent Al Hixenbaugh for WHAS-TV on more than 10 feet of film in which a brightly flying object showed clearly throughout.

Hixenbaugh, on assignment to take other shots for the station, suddenly heard the roar of a plane above him, glanced up and saw both the plane and the "flying disc" to its left. He said it was a large bright object with a slight corona around it.

He witnessed his move camera and shot, with the object appearing motionless for about 10 seconds. Then the object began to get smaller and finally vanished into the west. The "saucer" appeared on all the film he took, but the nearly plane was out of the picture.

Air fields here said no planes had reported seeing such a disk yesterday and the Air Force has denied repeatedly that "flying saucers" exist.

Cairo, Ill. June 28 (U.P.)—Five persons in three sections of the city reported today that they spotted a "flying saucer" in the sky southwest of here at approximately the same time.

All agreed that the egg-shaped object was a high altitude and had a chrome finish. They said it bore no resemblance to an airplane.
