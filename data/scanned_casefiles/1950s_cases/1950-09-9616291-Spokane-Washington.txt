11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
When observer first noticed objects, his first impression was that they were extra large pieces of cardboard or wrapping paper tumbling about in an oversize "dust devil". Observer continued to watch them, however, seemed to indicate that the objects were held aloft by a force other than air currents. They reacted in a manner indicating motive power of their own. All three objects acted independently and highly erratically. For example, one object would move up while another would move down and the third sideways. Object was observed through monocular (6X23).

Both Mrs. Gardiner and a neighbor, Mrs. Lowell Allen, observed the third object as it climbed and disappeared toward FAFB. Major Gardiner described the objects as a rather flat, pancake-shaped, 20 to 30 feet across, 2 to 6 feet in depth. When first sighted they appeared a khaki tan in color but through the monocular appeared a metallic bronze. Observation was difficult because the objects were constantly quivering and oscillating in the air. They were capable of abrupt changes of direction and speed, yet could also hang motionless in the air except for quivering motion. No sounds were heard. The weather was CAV0. Neither Mrs. Gardiner nor the neighbor could identify the objects. No dust or other debris was associated with them and no trail, smoke, or flame could be seen. They appeared from the NW hallowing the Spokane River until they were abreast of the NW corner of the city of Spokane, orbiting there for approximately five minutes and then proceeding SW almost directly toward FAFB. All three objects appeared to have a high rate of speed, difficult to estimate because of lack of reference as to size and distance away. No further observations were reported.

Sighting of wife of Capt. Don C. Fortney, Monday 3 Sep 2220 hours

Capt. and Mrs. Fortney were returning from the city of Spokane to FAFE. Capt. Fortney was driving west on Highway 2 about one mile or less from the eastern edge of the field when Mrs. Fortney observed a bluish white light approaching the car from the northeast. The light was moving at "high speed" and came at the car so directly that Mrs. Fortney became frightened for fear it would strike the car. It passed over, however, and proceeded on a SW course overlying the runways and hangar area of FAFE. According to Mrs. Fortney, the light increased in size (from that of an auto headlight to twice the size) over the hangar area, emitting sparks in a fizzy trail appearing in various colors other than blue-white which it had been. At this time, the light suddenly went out. No other observations were made. No sound was heard. The course was roughly NE to SW and travel was parallel to the ground at a low altitude. No aircraft were in the vicinity at that time. Capt. Fortney did not observe the phenomenon as he was concentrating on driving and had his sun visor down (reason unknown).

Sighting of Clifford L. Ponsness 1st Lt. (pilot), Saturday 8 Sep 2220 hours

Lt. Ponsness was returning to his quarters from the home of a friend, walking north on a street in the officer housing area when he observed a bluish-white light about the size of an auto headlight approaching the field from the north. He watched it as it passed over the western edge of the field where it enlarged "sparks" in a trail form or a trail for a few seconds and then abruptly went out. The time was approximately 2220. No sounds were heard. No aircraft were in the vicinity of the field at the time. The course of the object was from the NE to SW over FAFE, paralleling the earth at approximately 150 miles per hour.

Sighting of Russell J. Gardiner, Major, Observer, Monday 3 Sep 1400 Hours

Major Gardiner was relaxing in the back yard of his home in the extreme corner of the city of Spokane when he noticed three strange objects appearing out of the NW. His first impression was that they were extra large pieces of cardboard or wrapping paper tumbling about in an oversize "dust devil", about 2000' above the terrain. Continued observation, however, seemed to indicate that the objects were held aloft by a force other than air currents. They reacted in a manner indicating motive power of their own. All three objects acted independently and highly erratically. For example, one object would move up while another would move down and the third sideways.

After watching the objects for two or three minutes, Major Gardiner called to his wife to bring a monocular (6X23) from the house. Then Mrs. Gardiner returned with the glass only one of the objects could be seen, the other two having departed in the direction of Fairchild Air Force Base.

Major Gardinier was relaxing in the back yard of his home in the extreme corner of the city of Spokane when he noted three strange objects
appearing out of the NW. His first impression was that they were extra
large pieces of cardboard or wrapping paper tumbling about in an oversize
"eddy" about 2000' above the terrain. Continued observation, however, seemed to indicate that the objects were held aloft by a force other
than air currents. They acted in a manner indicating motive power of
their own. All three objects acted independently and highly erratically.
For example, one object would move up while another would move down and
the third sideways.

After watching the objects for two or three minutes, Major Gardinier
called to his wife to bring a monocular (6X23) from the house. When Mrs.
Gardinier returned with the glass only one of the objects could be seen,
the other two having departed in the direction of Fairchild Air Force Base.
