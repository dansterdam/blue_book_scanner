7. COURSE: NW
8. PHOTOS: None
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
When observer first noticed objects, his first impression was that they were aircraft of some kind. The objects appeared to be circular or cylindrical in shape and moved with a smooth, gliding motion, occasionally darting up, down or sideways. They seemed to indicate that the objects were maneuvering on their own in a manner indicating independent and highly erratic motion.

UNCLASSIFIED

Both Mrs. Gardinier and a neighbor, Mrs. Lovell Allen, observed the third object as it climbed and disappeared toward FAFD. Major Gardinier described the objects as flying at an estimated 20 to 50 feet across, 2 to 6 feet in depth. When first sighted they appeared a khaki tan in color but through the binoculars looked somewhat metallic. Observation was difficult due to the air currents. They were capable of abrupt changes of direction and speed, yet no sounds were heard. The weather was CAVU. Neither Mrs. Gardinier nor the neighbor could identify the object. They appeared from the hazy the Spokane-Ritz Theater and proceeded generally toward the east for approximately five minutes and then proceeding SE, almost directly toward FAFD. All three objects appeared to have a high rate of speed, difficult to estimate because of lack of reference as to size and distance. No further observations were reported.

Sighting of Capt. and Mrs. Fortney, Sunday 3 Sep 2220 hours
Capt. and Mrs. Fortney were returning from the city of Spokane to FARE. Capt. Fortney was driving west on Highway 2 about one mile or less from the eastern edge of the field when Mrs. Fortney observed a bluish-white light approaching the car from the northeast. The light was moving at high speed and came at the car as directly that Capt. Fortney became frightened for fear it would strike the car. It passed over, however, and proceeded on a very rapid course, varying its altitude, speed and manner area of its maneuver over the hangars of the field, ultimately appearing like the flash of an auto headlight to twice the size) over the hangar area, emitting sparks in a fiery trail appearing in various colors other than blue-white which it had been. At that time, the light suddenly went out. No other motion or other motion was heard. The course was roughly NW to SE and was parallel to the ground at a low altitude. No aircraft were in the vicinity at that time. Capt. Fortney did not observe the phenomenon until it was concentrating on driving and had his sun visor down (unknown)

Sighting of Clifford L. Ponsness 1st Lt. (pilot), Saturday 3 Sep 2220 hours
Lt. Ponsness was returning to his quarters from the home of a friend, walking north on a street in the officer's housing area when he observed a bluish-white light about the size of an auto headlight approaching the street. He watched it approach and it appeared to dip down over the street about 30 to 40 feet off the ground. It paused there for a few seconds and then abruptly went out. The time was approximately 2220. No sounds were heard. No aircraft were in the vicinity at the time. The course of the object was from the NE to SW over the field at the time. The course of the object was from the NE to SW over the field at the time.

Sighting of Russell J. Gardinier, Major (Carrier) Monday 3 Sep 1400 Hours
Major Gardinier was relaxing in the back yard of his home in the extreme eastern edge of Spokane when he noticed three strange objects appearing out of the NW. His first impression was that they were extra lights of some kind or 'spacecraft' or 'wrapping paper landing' about in an erratic "dust devil" about 2000' above the terrain. Continued observation, however, showed his vision could not be limited to less than air currents. They reacted in a manner indicating motive power of their own. All three objects acted independently and individually ascended and descended under perfect control, with no noticeable lifting or apparent effort, and would move down and the third sideways.

After watching the objects for two or three minutes, Major Gardinier called to his wife to bring a monocular (x6x2) from the house. When Mrs. Gardinier returned with the glass, only one of the objects could be seen.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. The image shows text describing an incident involving an unidentified flying object observed by Mrs. Gardinier and a neighbor, Mrs. Lowell Allen. The text discusses the object's appearance, movement, and behavior, as well as the witnesses' observations. There is no photograph included in this page.

UNCLASSIFIED
Both Mrs. Gardinier and a neighbor, Mrs. Lowell Allen, observed the third object as it climbed and disappeared toward FAF. Major Gardinier described the object as "bright as another star." It appeared to be pulsing and descended, 2 to 3 times in depth, when first sighted. Still the monotonous appearance was initially terrifying. Conversation was difficult in the air. They were capable of abrupt changes of direction and speed. No sounds were heard. The weather was CAVU. Neither Mrs. Gardinier nor the neighbor could identify the object. No trail, smoke, or flame could be seen. They appeared to rise and then followed the course of the speaker viewer until for approximately five minutes and then proceeding almost directly toward FAF. All three objects appeared to have a high rate of speed, difficult to estimate because of lack of reference as to size and distance. No further observations were reported.

There is no visible photograph or image in this document. The document appears to be a typed report from Project Blue Book, describing two sightings of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

Sighting of Mrs. Portnoy, wife of Capt. Ion C. Portnoy, Monday 3 Sep 2220 hours

Capt. and Mrs. Portnoy were returning from the city of Spokane to FAEB. Capt. Portnoy was driving west on Highway 2 about one mile or less when his attention was called to the field where Portnoys residence is located. The field was "illuminated at high speed" and came at the car so directly that Mrs. Portnoy became frightened for car it would hit her. It passed over, however, and proceeded on a SE course overflying the runways and hanger area of FAEB. According to the Portnoys, the light appeared in size (from that of an auto headlight to twice the size) over the hanger area, emitting a steady brilliant white light, appearing to be in a disc or globe shape. No other observations were made. No sound was heard. The course was roughly NE and SW and travel was at a low altitude. No aircraft were in the vicinity at that time. Capt. Portnoy did not observe the phenomenon, as he was concentrating on driving and had his sun visor down (reason unknown).

Sighting of Russell J. Gardiner, Major (observer) Monday 3 Sep 1400 Hours

Major Gardiner was relaxing in the back yard of his home in the extreme corner of the city of Spokane when he noticed three strange objects approaching over the horizon. His first indication was that they were extra large pieces of cardboard or wrapping paper tumbling about in an erratic fashion, about 20,000 above the horizon. Continued observation, however, seemed to indicate that the objects were held aloft by a force other than wind currents in the ordinary sense. However, the three objects displayed and exhibited a manner of individual maneuvering, for example, one object would move sideways while another would move down and another would suddenly disappear.

After watching the objects for two or three minutes, Major Gardiner called to his wife to bring a monocular (6x23) from the house. When Mrs. Gardiner returned with the monocular, the objects could be seen to be disc-shaped as they veered off in different directions, then apparently one of the three having departed in the meantime.
