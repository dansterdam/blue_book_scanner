SUMMARY: (Enter main points of report. Use continuation sheet if necessary)

At 2140 hours on 29 September 1952 information concerning a "flying saucer" was phoned in to the Bryan Air Force Base Control Tower by a Dr. [redacted] and [redacted], supposedly members of a party of seven who allegedly had seen an object flying over Hearne, Texas, at 2107 hours. Few definite facts were given, and the phone connection was poor, causing the report to be rather garbled.

The accuracy of the information and reliability of the observers cannot be established.

A/3C Joseph J. Krupka, AF 17312199, Central Tower Operator, received the following information by telephone in the Bryan Air Force Base Control Tower at 2140 hours on 29 September 1952.

"Persons giving the name of [redacted] and Dr. [redacted] called in to the Control Tower and said they observed one large flying saucer over Hearne, Texas, at 2107 hours, 29 September 1952. The object made a large semi-circular sweep from south to north and made its exit to the southwest at a terrific rate of speed. The object was described as orange-yellow and black in color. Several of the men in the alleged party of seven timed the celestial appearance as being in sight 20-30 seconds. All one was visible, the saucer had no wings.

Altitude was estimated roughly at 30,000 feet."

Upon inquiry it was discovered that neither Mr. [redacted] was located in the telephone directory of Hearne, Texas, or of Bryan, Texas, or anywhere in the neighboring areas; therefore, further questioning was not possible. The reliability of the observer also could not be established.
