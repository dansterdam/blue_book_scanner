AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

USA
Report of Unidentified Flying Objects

DATE OF REPORT: 25 April 1952     DATE OF INFORMATION: 24 April 1952
SOURCE: Office of Intelligence, USAF Connally Air Force Base
PREPARED BY (original): RUTHERFORD, CAPT., USAF
REFERENCES: (other numbers, previous report, etc. reproduced)

SUMMARY:
The phenomenon sighted by [redacted] appeared as a group, each object being of a round or oval shape. Although he sustained the distance between his and the objects, he is not positively of the accuracy of his estimation, therefore making an approximation of the size of the objects impossible. There were between 20 and 30 objects, each object being described as a "tangerine color".

The observer noticed no recognizable aerodynamic features about the objects and stated there was no trail or exhaust. There was a sound emitted by objects described as being that of a "rushing wind".

In his observation, the objects made no sharp turns and maneuvers and disappeared from his sight into the distance.

There were two groups of the objects, one being at a greater distance away but of the same description. The first group passed over at approximately 2150 and the second group was observed for about 20 to 25 seconds. The objects were flying in a group but in no defined formation. The first group was estimated to have been 1 or 1.5 miles away, both flying 250 to 300 above the horizon.

The observer was located at the Cactus Drive-In Theatre on the Dallas Highway. The geographic coordinates of this area are: 31° 35' North, 97° 08' West.

Prior to seeing cars, from which he made his observation, was parked directly in front of the screen and adjacent to the theatre. In his first sighting, he sighted the objects over the projection area flying on a course from south to north. As stated before, both groups appeared at an estimated 1 to 1.5 miles from the observer.

The observer, [redacted], is an electrician for the [redacted].

His wife, [redacted] in Waco, his observations were witnessed and verified by her.

The only known factor that could have been misleading to the observer's visual perception of the objects was the fact that during his observation, he was within his car, therefore, watching the objects through a windshield and loosely above a well-lighted projection screen.

The description of the objects by 2nd Lt. [redacted] is as follows:
Round in shape like "soda cracker", approximately 150 feet in diameter. Due to the
angle of observation the shape could not be determined. Each object gave off a
light red or orange colored luminous glow.

The objects were in a well defined narrow V shaped formation numbering between
15 and 20.

The formation reportedly traversed an arc of 150 in azimuth during the time of
observation. There was no wind or standard meteorological conditions to hamper
well over 600 miles per hour. The objects emitted no sound, flew straight with no
maneuvering and generally held from the observer's vision. No passing lights or other
normal features of any known conventional aircraft were noted on these objects.

The observer's wife, [redacted], who was with him at the time of the sighting,
corroborated the report. The observers were both located at the Joy Drive-In
Theatre on the night in question, 16 April 1952, approximately 5.2 miles northwest
of Waco, Texas. The geographic coordinates are 31°37'30" North - 97°07' West. From this point the objects were reported to have been
flying. From the south-southwest on a north-northeast, course and were and were at an apex
point 5 to 7 miles away from the observers at an altitude of about 5000 feet.

Lt. Gaynor, reporter of the observation, is an Air Force Navigator in the
Radar Observer School at this base and possesses an aeronautical rating as a navigator.
The following are factors derived from analysis by same and corroborating witnesses
in my personal opinion as interrogator, to a degree, decisive in your evaluation of
this report:

Mr. the observer, thought at first that he had spotted a flock of birds, upon closer observation, noticed that they weren't a flock of birds, but an unidentified flying formation. He got into his car to get a more accurate visual picture of the formation. He described them as being round objects of a steady orange colored glow. The speed and altitude of the formation was estimated to be very slow, with the observer overhead until they disappeared from his sight they were under his observation for approximately 7-8 seconds. There were no answers, trail or exhaust and no turbulence around. Upon disappearing from his sight they seemed to incorporate into one close or orange light.

The objects were sighted on April 18, 1952 between 2100 and 2200 hours. As mentioned before, they were under his observation for about 1 minute and 10 seconds.

The observer was located at the Celava Drive-In Theater on the Dallas Highway, No. 81. The geographic coordinates of this are near: 31°, 36' North, 97°, 06', 20" West.

The objects when sighted first were directly above the observer and were coming from the southeast, coming in a north-northwesterly course.

Mr. _______ is the proprietor of the Ballhead Bakery on the Waco-Corsicana Highway near Waco. He arrived at James Connally Air Force Base, having served at James Connally Air Force Base. He seems to be interested in flying to the extent that he tried out for cadets while in the service and later on in civilian life. A cleared statement by Flying Cadet A. J. Hendrich's statement could be depended upon as fairly reliable. The observer also stated that there objects were coming, that he had never seen before.

The weather conditions in this area at the time of the observation were as follows: sky clear - visibility 15 miles, temperature 58°, dew point 42, northeast winds at 10 miles per hour.

There were no unusual meteorological activities or conditions reported that might account for these sightings.

There is no physical evidence of the sightings in existence and no interceptive action was taken.

For further information that might have bearing on this report refer base to James Connally Air Force Base IR-4-52.
