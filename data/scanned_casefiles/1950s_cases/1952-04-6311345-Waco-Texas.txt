The phenomena sighted by an observer is described as a group, such as a solid oval or disc-like object, All attempts to examine it closely with binoculars were thwarted by rapid changes in altitude and direction. The object was positiv e or the accuracy of the observer's observations. There was no sound associated with the object. The observer believed the object to be about 1500 yards from his position.

After about two minutes, the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared in the distance. The observer has had considerable experience in identifying aircraft and celestial objects and states that this was neither. The observer is considered reliable.

The only known factor that could have been misleading to the observer's visual perceptions is the presence of a possible illusion caused by mirage effects. However, the observer is positive he was not subjected to a mirage or illusion, and that this was a real object seen through a windshield and immediately vaporized.

Transcribed text from the document:

Presbyteran Book Store
WACO, TEXAS
April 6, 1952

Dear Sir:

This letter is to report the observation of a highly unusual object in the sky over Waco, Texas, on the evening of April 6, 1952.
Approximately 9:30 p.m., my wife and I were standing outside our home in North Waco when we noticed a bright, hovering object in the sky to the northwest. At first, we thought it might be an aircraft of some kind, but as we watched, the object suddenly accelerated and shot straight up into the sky at a tremendous speed, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds.
The object was round or disc-shaped, silent, and emanating a bright, white light. It hovered motionless for several minutes before its rapid ascent. There were no wings, no trail, no sound, and no other identifying features.
I realize that this may sound like a typical "flying saucer" report, but I can assure you that my wife and I are rational, intelligent observers who have never before reported anything of this nature. We are both still quite shaken by what we witnessed.
I would appreciate any information you may be able to provide regarding this incident, or any similar sightings that may have been reported in the Waco area. Please let me know if you require any additional details from me.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
