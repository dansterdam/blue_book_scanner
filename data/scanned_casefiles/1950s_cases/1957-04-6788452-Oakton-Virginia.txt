SUBJECT: UNKNOWN OBJECT, OAKTON, VIRGINIA 
REFERENCE: TELEGRAM, 6 APRIL 1957, ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE 

FOLLOWING INVESTIGATION OF UNKNOWN OBJECT AS REPORTED IN REFERENCED TELEGRAM, THE FOLLOWING FACTS WERE DETERMINED: 

OBJECT FIRST OBSERVED APPROXIMATELY 6:15 P.M. ON 6 APRIL 1957, BY SEVERAL CIVILIAN WITNESSES IN OAKTON, VIRGINIA AREA. WITNESSES DESCRIBED OBJECT AS MOVING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, SILENTLY, AND DISAPPEARING TO THE SOUTHWEST AFTER APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE OF OBSERVATION. OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS ROUND OR DISC-SHAPED, APPEARING AT FIRST TO BE APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF A PENNY HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. IT INCREASED IN SIZE AS IT APPROACHED, THEN DECREASED IN SIZE AS IT MOVED AWAY. NO LIGHTS OR OTHER DISTINGUISHING FEATURES WERE OBSERVED. 

INVESTIGATION INDICATED NUMEROUS OTHER CIVILIAN WITNESSES WHO OBSERVED THE OBJECT OVER A WIDESPREAD AREA. HOWEVER, DUE TO DARKNESS AND BREVITY OF SIGHTING, PARTICULARS OF OBSERVATION COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. 

INQUIRY AT NEAREST AIR FORCE INSTALLATION, ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, DISCLOSED NO KNOWN AIR TRAFFIC IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. FURTHER CHECKS WITH AIR DEFENSE COMMAND AND WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL REVEALED NO IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT. 

BASED ON INVESTIGATION, NO CONCLUSIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT CAN BE MADE. IT IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN AT AN APPROXIMATE SLANT RANGE OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FEET.
