Gentlemen:

I have taken some photographs which may be of interest to you. In these photos are what I believe a U.F.O. I am now think they are flying several U.F.O's best yours of. I now was ten when I got to site. I developed the film myself and note in photos. Since then I've made all kinds of my hands on in the subject. I have three different negative of the lights as am just sending to visitor. If you want the negative I can readily note them to you.

The other is a more bar appear to a U.F.O. that didn't show us so I can enclose it. The next time and I hope you find these. Dear Dark your.

Sincerely,

[Note: Some words are difficult to read precisely due to handwriting, so this is the best interpretation of the text.]

There is no legible text on this page. The image contains two black and white photographs, both appearing to be somewhat blurry and low contrast. The top photograph seems to show part of a house or building, while the bottom photograph appears to be a landscape or outdoor scene with indistinct details.
