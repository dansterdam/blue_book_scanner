STATEMENT

At about 2230 hours, 16 August 1953, I was called to view a certain object in the sky. My first thought was that it was the moon, but I changed my mind after viewing it for a few seconds. The object was stationary for a minute and disappeared for a few seconds. Then it reappeared 10 to 30 degrees to the right and disappeared. The object was bright orange in color and shaped like a piece of pie crust. The sky condition was clear. I saw no clouds and no stars. The distance I estimated was around 3 to 5 miles and low.

On the 15 August 1953, at 2235, I sighted an object by visual contact
which was sort of distracting and bright. It was a circular, relatively
270 degrees at a to 5 miles out and very low. It was hovering at last
spot. I watched this object for about 2 minutes then it turned to bright
red and flat in shape and faded away. This object could be "saucer-
shaped" as swirls, pertaining to the night was clear and there
was no moon.

STATEMENT

At about 2230 hours, 16 August 1953, the radar maintenance man called to the van in the front door. He pointed to the sky and I noticed a glow in the sky. The object was cone shaped and in an almost horizontal position. It was in a south west direction. The color was orange, or like a bright sun. I watched it for most of a minute and a half in its original shape. Then it moved W.S.W. and got smaller, about the size of a star. It got bright again, and then faded gray. There was no moon and the weather was clear in my estimation.

The following is a more detailed report on a FIXOBSPT transmitted by teletype on
17 August 1953.

1. At about 2235 EDT on 16 Aug 1953, an unidentified object was seen in the
sky by at least seven persons of this organization. The first person to see the
object was T Sgt Rickard, while searching, what to him appeared to be a forest-fire, to A/2C Lysakowski. He instructed him to call
operations located on a hill 3 miles east to fix the position of the light. There,
four airmen were positioned a diamond or pie-cut shaped orange red object. It was low
on the horizon, disappeared for a short moment and reappeared weaker before fading
away for good. Azimuth approximately 250 degrees. Motion was negligible, if any.
Spead and distance could not be determined. A definite outline was observed, no
sound was detected. Weather was clear. Moon was not out.

2. The object was first seen at about 2235 EDT, 16 August 1953, and it was
observed for approximately five minutes.

3. The object was observed from the surface by visual means only. Although
units radar was operational, no targets were observed on the scopes before, during,
and after visual observation.

4. The observers were located about three and six miles east of the town of
Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The object was almost or completely stationary in the
west as approximately 250 degrees. It was moving very low on the horizon. It
disappeared for a moment but came into sight again, weaker this time and then disappeared shortly for good.

5. Although the statements made by the witnesses differ slightly, all the
witnesses are considered reliable. They hold positions of responsibility in the
squadron and their statements were made after due consideration and thought.

6. Weather was clear, winds aloft unknown.

7. Position of object not known.

8. There is no physical evidence of the sighting.

9. Visual observation reported to appropriate ACI Squadron immediately.

10. No air traffic detected in area before, during and after sighting.

STATEMENT

On the 16th of August, 1953, I was on patrol duty, about 2110 I arrived at the mess hall after serving guard to the main gate. Just before stopping, Sgt Halstrom made a motion for me to come over to the barracks. When I got there he told me to quickly turn out the lights on the vehicle and look out the window. To my surprise I saw a bright red object. It looked like a fire as it was bright reddish orange. It stayed bright for a few seconds then went dim, I was about four feet in a different direction and I became bright, again. I've Halstrom told me to call operation on the hill activate them get a fix on the object. The troops going on shift got into the vehicle and when I arrived on the hill, the object was gone. The airman that did see it from the hill said it was sort of pie-shaped.

At approximately 2245 EDT on the night of August 16, I went to the camera to 7.97 to pack of cigarettes. On my return I noticed through the trees in a south-westerly direction what I believed to be a forest fire. Upon noticing this, I drew it to the attention of A/2c Krasowski. I stated this to call persons for a check and location of a forest fire. I could report it to the Lands and Forests Department of Ontario.
