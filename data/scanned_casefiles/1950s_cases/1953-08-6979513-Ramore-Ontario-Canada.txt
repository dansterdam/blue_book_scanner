STATEMENT

At about 2830 hours, 6 August 1953, a person was called to view a certain object in the sky. This object was the moon, but it changed color and shape rapidly. The object was definitely not the moon. It hovered for 30 minutes and disappeared for a few seconds. Then it reappeared for 30 to 35 minutes and disappeared. The object gave off color, was round, and looked like a piece of plate. The sky conditions were clear. I saw no clouds and no stars.

13 August 1953

STATEMENT

On the 12 August 1953, at about 2325 hours, a bright object was visually sighted by a crew consisting of 5 members of this unit. The object appeared to be about 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground and was observed for about 2 to 3 minutes. It maintained a steady flight and finally disappeared to the northwest. I watched it is object as it was in sight and I considered it to be a solid, self-luminous body, larger than a star and about the size of a small aircraft. This was a very clear night and no clouds were present as to interfere with the visual contact.

STATEMENT

At about 22:00 hrs, 13 Aug 1953, my attention was called to a very bright glow in the sky. This object seemed to be of some shape as it appeared then to be again. It was a pillar of light standing as bright as the sun for about 2 1/2 minutes, when it gradually faded, dimmed and disappeared. The object was seen, unknown, shape, size, color, and did not make any appreciable sound, weather, clear.

STATEMENT

At about 2230 hours, 15 August 1953, the radar operator man called the radar control and advised a glow in the sky. The object was some distance and in an east direction. This object was pulsating or flashing and would disappear and reappear. This happened several times. The object appeared to be at a high altitude. After about 2 minutes the object disappeared and about a minute later a similar object appeared in the same direction. This object remained visible for about 4 minutes and then faded away. There was no moon and the weather was clear in the estimation.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM COMMAND: 212C2 U.S. Air Force
LOCATION: Ramore, Ontario, Canada
DATE: 17 AUGUST 1953
The following is a more detailed report on a FLYCBAFT transmitted by teletype on 17 August 1953:
1. At about 2235 EDT on 6 Aug 1953, an unidentified object was seen in the sky by at least seven persons of this organization. The first person to see the object was a pilot returning from a flight. He reported seeing what appeared to be an aircraft approaching on a rapid descent down to about 2,000 feet. As it came nearer, the object was definitely not an aircraft, but appeared to be circular in shape and giving off a brilliant light. The object hovered for a short while, then disappeared. It was not seen again. Speed and distance could not be determined. A definite outline was observed. No sound was detected.
2. The object was first seen at about 2235 EDT, 16 August 1953, and it was observed for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.
3. The object was observed from the surface by visual means only. Although a search was made with binoculars, no targets were observed on the scope before, during and after visual observations.
4. The observers were located about three and six miles west of the town of Ramore, Ontario. The object was first observed at the east end of the runway of the airfield and then disappeared. It was hovering very low on the horizon. It disappeared after about 15 minutes when the lights and haze on the horizon made it difficult to keep it in sight.
5. Although the statements made by the witnesses differ slightly, all the witnesses are considered reliable. They hold positions of responsibility in the organization and their statements were made in the same consideration and thought.
6. Weather was clear, wind's left unknown.
7. Position of object not known.
8. There is no physical evidence of the sighting.
9. Visual observation reported to appropriate 6GI Squadron immediately.
10. No air traffic detected in area before, during and after sighting.

18 August 1953

STATEMENT

On the 16th of August, 1953, I was on patrol duty, about 21:00 I arrived at the mess hall after going the guard to the main gate. Just b doing this, the guard told me to come over to the barracks. When I got there he told me that he had just seen a bright light in the air travelling at a high speed and then disappear. To investigate this, I went outside and it was about a few seconds I saw a very bright light in a different direction and it remained stationary for a few minutes and then it went dim, it was like a flare, only much more bright. The troops, who were outside at the time the article appeared, could not give any detailed description of the object. The object was gone. We are sure that did see it from the hill and it was sort of discernible.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2245 EDT on the night of August 13, I went to the barrage to dispatch a back of cigarettes. As I left the barrage, I noticed in the sky to the northeast a bright light which appeared to be quite large and which was slowly moving from the northeast to the southwest at a fairly high rate of speed. I watched this light for about 10 to 15 minutes until it disappeared from sight. After observing the light, I immediately reported it to my superior officer, and I was requested to call operations for a check and location so that it could be investigated further. I could not report its exact location due to the fact that it was a considerable distance away and had moved from the point where I first observed it.

At approximately 21:00 on 16 August 1953, a civilian observer saw a strange object which was later identified as an unidentified flying object.
