SUMMARY 52-4, 1400th ABG, 8 Oct 52, cc 1 copy UF witnessed at about 2100& on 8 Oct 52 four officers of the recently arrived 932nd Act Sq witnessed a strange object in the sky. Specifically, it was perfectly round, they said, except for an irregularity in its trailing edge, and its outline was quite distinct. One of them said it was 5 to 10 miles away, another said that it appeared to be flat. It had a pinkish-orange color, and was variously described as pale, pinkish, transparent, translucent. It initially had a two bearing of 35 to 40 degrees and elevation of about 60 degrees. It traveled very rapidly on a course of about 200 degrees at an estimated speed of 600 to 700 knots. Then, after decreasing speed somewhat, and with a slight loss of altitude, it turned to a course of about 135 degrees, went into an almost vertical climb at an extremely high rate of speed, disappeared from view, and then reappeared. Although it traversed an arc of about 90 degrees in about 6 seconds.

The object, like many other objects, was seen by the senior controller of the 932nd Act Sq. He was among 5 to 10 thousand feet. One of them also estimated its speed at 600 knots and its diameter at 5 to 10 thousand feet.

COMMENT: Local GSA did not report such a sighting, nor did either the Keflavik or the Reykjavik towers. There was only one locally based aircraft (a C-47) flying locally at the time. This object was not a weather balloon at about 2100& each day, but the one released 8 Oct 52 was not sighted. It was about 1537Z, almost three hours prior to the sighting, so it is unlikely that the object, if it were a balloon, could have been the sun's rays to make the photothermal color ascribed to it.

Local winds at 2100Z were from 20 degrees to CIO degrees. This neither the apparent speed of the object nor its initial course could be accounted for by the direction of force of the wind. "With men in Reykjavik recently saw a kind of ball going across the sky at a terrific speed."

Here is the text I can read from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED ENCL

[Top right corner appears to have some text but is partially illegible]

[Several lines at the top are partially obscured/blacked out]

[Main body of text is mostly illegible due to poor image quality and blurring. Some words and fragments are visible but not enough to construct complete sentences.]

At the bottom of the page there are some additional blacked out/redacted sections and the text "7 ENCLS"

The document appears to be an official military or government document, likely related to a UFO incident given the filename context, but the text is not clearly readable in this scanned image.
