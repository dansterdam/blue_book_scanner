Unidentified Flying Objects over Keflavik Airport, Iceland
13 October 1952
REPORT MADE BY: Captain
DUTY OF PERSON MAKING REPORT: Pilot
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: "As of 9-05" to 9-15 PM
TWO small lights, about 1/2 degree apart, and about 10-15 degrees above horizon, traveling with about 1-2 degree of arc per 15 seconds, or a rate of 4-8 degrees per minute, elevation slightly descending. Size of objects estimated to be about 1/2 to 1 degree in diameter, possibly brighter than stars of 0 magnitude. Objects disappeared below horizon after about 10-15 minutes. One of them seemed to increase in intensity for a second or two, then suddenly went out. Both objects were "steady", i.e., not blinking. No sound was heard. Sky was clear, visibility excellent. Numerous stars and planets visible, including Venus, bright as usual. Objects did not appear to be at the extreme range where most stars or planets would be seen. Something out of the ordinary was observed. It was weird and unexplainable. I called it to the attention of the tower operator, and he saw it too, but he had no explanation for it. Radar at Keflavik installation did not pick up any targets corresponding to the objects. This, together with the fact that the objects were not blinking lights, seems to indicate they were not aircraft.
