Appearance of unexplained blip on radar scope

Area Reported On: United States

Date of Report: 28 March 1952
Date of Information: 26 March 1952

Evaluated: E-2

Prepared By: Captain William F. Byass

VO of Acft 4-9299

B-3 Report submitted to Hq., SAF during conduct of Mission 105-52

SUMMARY:
1. While participating in a mission of the 509th Bombardment Wing (M), the Radar Observer of a B-50 aircraft was using his radar scope while keeping, maintaining a specified position relative to the lead aircraft by observation of the lead aircraft on the radar scope. A blip appeared on the scope at a position reciprocal to this or the lead aircraft and remained visible for approximately five minutes.

2. Inasmuch as no aircraft or other object was in a position to produce such a return on the scope, it is the belief that the Radar Observer saw a phenomenon reflecting 180° out of phase with the image of the lead aircraft.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

509th Bombardment Wing (H)    509-79-1    PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

4. On the night of 26 March 1952, B-50G aircraft 4-9299, piloted by Captain John F. Muding, AC-2055454, was participating in a "wing mission" as directed by Eighth Air Force Operations Order 105-52. The Radar Observer was Captain James F. LaCollette, AC-2092C19. This aircraft was assigned the task of station-keeping by radar and was maintaining its position relative to the lead aircraft through the use of the radar scope. At the time of the occurrence covered by this report, aircraft 9299 was abreast of the lead aircraft and one mile to its left, as indicated by the return of the lead aircraft on the radar scope of the observed aircraft.

4. At approximately 2030 UST, while flying at 15,500 feet on a heading of 291° in the area of 310 10'N - 109° 30'W, there appeared an additional blip on the scope in a position equidistant from the blip of the lead aircraft and 180° out of phase, as indicated by the following diagram:

[A circular diagram with "LEAD ACFT", "1 MILE RANGE", and "IMAGE" labeled]

5. This second blip remained on the scope for approximately five minutes and then disappeared. The aircraft was visible in a position which would have produced a return at that spot on the scope, and it is the belief of the Radar Observer that an audio-replay of the radar set not produced a reflected image of the lead aircraft.

6. The statement included in the B-9 Report submitted to Eighth Air Force during the conduct of Mission 101-52 to the effect that the "Radar Observer not in position to be clearing to be aware of a bogey" does not point to this sighting, as the blip in this case remained motionless on the scope, as did the blip of the lead aircraft which was particularly noted.

7. Copies of three consecutive exposures of the radar scope which include the unusual blip are included in duplicate with this report.

2. On the night of 26 March 1952, B-50D aircraft 4-9999, piloted by [ILLEGIBLE] was participating in a wing mission as attached to Eighth Air Force Operations Order 105-52. This aircraft was assigned the task of station-keeping by radar and was maintaining its position relative to the load aircraft through the use of the radar scope. At the time of the occurrence covered by this report, the observing aircraft was approximately one mile to the left of and between one-quarter and one-half mile behind the lead aircraft, as indicated by the radar scope of the observing aircraft.

3. While flying at 27,500 feet on a heading of 260° in the area of 320 35' N - 1090 41' W, with 2 True Air Speed of 270 knots, the Observer, Captain James F. McClelland, AC-20,9239, had his set on the two-mile range. He now saw an additional blip appear on the scope at 2 o'clock from his own aircraft and move rapidly in a direction toward 7 o'clock. While the light scanner, on interphone and asked if he was able to see the approaching aircraft, and he replied in the affirmative. The Radar Observer states that the blip of the unidentified aircraft remained on the scope a maximum of five minutes, flying the track shown in the following diagram:

[A circular diagram with "1 ML RANGE" is shown]

4. The Radar Observer states that at no time did the unidentified aircraft make a firing pass at the bomber nor approach within half a mile of the observing aircraft. He is of the opinion that, judging from the nature of its tactics, the unidentified aircraft appeared to be performing for identification. While it is difficult to assess the speed of an approaching aircraft, it has been in excess of that of a conventional fighter.

5. The light scanner states that he became aware of the approaching aircraft shortly before the Radar Observer. The unidentified aircraft was flying the position in the four-ship cell formation indicated in the following diagram:

[Diagram showing X positions]

When first observed, the unidentified aircraft was between the lead and #2 aircraft. It approached the observing aircraft and proceeded to a relative position of 7 o'clock, where it remained for several minutes.

saw it again as it returned to a 4 o'clock position, where it remained briefly before it peeled off and disappeared toward 4 o'clock.

6. The Right Scanner states that because of the darkness of the night, he was unable to see a definitely identifiable aircraft. During lights (red on left wing tip and green on right wing tip) were plainly visible. In was unable to use a jet exhaust but does not believe there was a possibility of a jet aircraft should be eliminated as he had only side and forward views.

7. The Right Scanner further states that the aircraft remained in the vicinity of the bomber between ten and fifteen minutes and was from 250 to 400 miles above the bomber.

8. Members of the crews of both the lead aircraft and the aircraft flying the 14 position confirm the presence of the unidentified aircraft, both through visual sighting and its producing a return on the radar scope.

Gibson Island, Md.
24 April 1952

Dear General:

Re: Flying Saucers

Witness: [Redacted]
Baltimore, Maryland

Scene: Ritchie Highway, Opposite Harness Racing Park near Glen Burnie
Date: Saturday, 19 April 1952, Approx. 1030 p.m. (Corrected to 29 March 1952)

Witness, with companion was driving an English Ford toward Baltimore. He heard a roaring sound overhead like a huge vacuum cleaner gone wild, looking out he saw overhead a great disk 'high' shaped like a huge pancake. Suddenly it turned on edge and with great speed it plummeted down till it reached about 200 ft. over the car. The disk, seen from its ends, had a large bubble with an aperture like a porthole. Witness was too frightened to observe any faces. The edges were 'pale green luminescence and a luminous aftertrail pulsated'. The object hovered about two minutes over the automobile which in the meantime had become immobilized.

Suddenly the disk took off in a rapid flight "toward Gibson Island or Annapolis".

Opposite a yellow automobile proceeding toward Annapolis was similarly immobilized.

Witness shouted at occupants, a young man and woman who closed their windows and appeared to lock their doors, but a minute or so later started their engine and took off. Witness was interviewed by Lou Corbin, a radio station (WBK) announcer.

Corbin is a reserve CIC Officer and up to date is keeping the story. Corbin first phoned a technical friend at Glen L. Martin's and received an impression that he took the story seriously but did not give any logical explanation. Corbin intends to go over the car engine with a Geiger counter because the car now gives off a "rough rattle" and a garage mechanic said that the metal appears to be magnetized.

House shook.

[REDACTED]: rushed outdoors and saw ---- (word is garbled).

Mrs. [REDACTED] and Judge and Mrs. [REDACTED], on Saturday night (on Gibson Island) heard "an aerial noise" and their house shook wildly.

Though I was on Gibson Island at the times mentioned, neither my wife or I recall any unusual noise. Had we heard it or felt any vibrations we would have dismissed it as noises and shocks that we have been attributing to aberceen.

[Name redacted], police say, have had many similar incidents reported, but laugh then off. A news post telephone operator refused to be interested in Stewart's story, said he had heard a dozen similar incidents on Saturday evening and dismissed them all as hallucinations.

11 May 1952

Subject: Memo for Record of Baltimore Sighting

1. This investigation was requested by Col Cook for Gen Ackerman and is to be given top priority. A report will be requested on Tuesday, 13 May 52, by w/Jt.

2. At about 1530 hrs. on Friday, 9 May 52, Lt Col Roy Taylor called Lt Col Free of OSI Headquarters in Washington. (Ordway 9600 or Code 192, Ext. 140, Bldg T-6)

The call was made from the Pentagon. Col Taylor gave Col Free details of the request over the telephone. At 1700 hrs Lt Ruppelt delivered a copy of the info to Col Free.

At that time Lt Ruppelt requested to accompany an investigator to interrogate the source but was unable to do so due to OSI policy. It was understood that Col Free called Lt Col Collins at 4th district OSI at Bolling AFB and that they would in turn get in touch with their Baltimore detachment. Lt Ruppelt was also advised that the source could not be located and was possibly gone for the weekend. In view of this, Lt Ruppelt changed his plans to go to Baltimore on Friday night and returned to the hotel in Washington to await further developments.

3. At about 0930 on the 10th, Saturday, Lt Ruppelt again called Col Free.

At this time he was told that OSI would try to locate the source on Saturday, possibly in the morning. Since an independent attempt by Lt Ruppelt to locate the source, and duplicate the OSI investigation was not practical, Lt Ruppelt decided to return to W-P AFB on Saturday, p.m. In addition, he was scheduled for Duty Officer and his orders had expired. He returned and made reservations on a 1314 TWA flight to Baltimore for Monday, the 12th.

4. At 1000 hrs. on Sunday, 11 May 52, Lt Ruppelt contacted S/A Springer, Duty agent for 5th LO OSI at W-P AFB in an attempt to find out whether or not there were any results from Saturdays attempt to locate the source. It was decided that since it was Sunday the best thing would be to wait until Monday morning and call 4th LO in Bolling and get the latest developments before leaving for Baltimore.


- page 26 -

5. S/A Springer will be contacted at 0800 Monday morning. Orders have been cut and will be processed first thing Monday morning. If the OSI report contains anything that indicates further investigation is desired (i.e., not a hoax). Lt Ruppelt will contact the Source and have a report by Monday night, or early Tuesday morning at the latest.

AF FORM 112—PART II
UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: 4704th Defense Wing                REPORT NO. IR-4704-1-52     PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES

1. Information required by ADOL 200-1, 11 Apr 51:
    a. Unidentified object resembling a large ball of fire which would
    hull up and then fade away. Indefinite shape; indicating start red color
    single object; no trail or exhaust; movable forward speed; would appear bril-
    liantly for a period of approximately forty-five (45) seconds and then fade out.

    b. Pilot estimated sightings at 0252 and 0316Z but did not make a
    record of the time and is not certain of times given. Duration of observation
    was approximately 45 seconds in each case.

    c. Observed visually from F-94 aircraft, speed 350 TAS, at 22,500 feet
    and again at 25,000 feet.

    d. SOURCE gave position as twenty (20) miles south of Yakima, Wash-
    ington. SOURCE overflew for seven (7) miles on heading of 30
    degrees at 22,500 feet on first sighting and on heading of 180 degrees at
    25,000 on second sighting. Both times object appeared about 10 degrees above
    local line of sight.

    e. SOURCE is considered usually reliable.

    f. Weather at point of sighting: 20,000 scattered, 25,000 scattered,
    30 miles visibility.

    Winds Aloft:  28,000-30,000' - 315° - 60 knots
                  18,000' - 315° - 60-100 knots (jet stream)
                  10,000' - 315° - 40 knots

    g. No activity, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for
    the sightings was reported.

    h. No physical evidence of the sightings was obtained.

    i. The intercepting aircraft was turned each time toward the object to
    pick up the magnetic heading and enable the Radar Observer to pick it up.
    Radar Observer under the hood did not observe the object visually and failed to
    pick it up on his scope.

    j. No local aircraft could have accounted for this sighting.

2. An overlay of the interceptor track, with times, is attached as
Inclosure 1. This overlay includes the positions of the target as obtained by
ground radar and shows the direction of the prevailing wind at medium and high
altitude.

3. COMMENT OF Preparing Officers: For the short period during which the
target was tracked, its speed and direction coincided with that of the prevail-
ing wind. The pilot stated that the observed object was heading of 180
degrees while 20 miles south of Yakima. The only time the intercepting air-
craft was south of Yakima was at 0300Z, at which time an object traveling with
the wind would have been at a position having a magnetic bearing of 180 degrees
from the P-94, taking the 20 degrees mean prevailing wind at that time. No
weather balloon was released from McChord AFB which could have been at that time,
at that position, but all installations releasing weather balloon in this area

pelled.
