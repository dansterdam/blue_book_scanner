closure* of the Unidentified Flying Object from this (3) times the
speed of a D-9 type aircraft to indicate that a conventional
fighter - the original report was submitted based on interrogation
of the D-50 case by a Wing Intelligence Officer, indicates a questionable
conclusion. The report was believed conclusive enough to substantiate a high

The man made a bright flash in the sky accompanied by a noise. The pilot said it was a bright red light, about the size of a dime at arm's length, and appeared to be about 10 to 12 miles away at an elevation of 12,000 feet or more. He said the light pulsated twice and then went out. No physical object could be seen. This could possibly cause flame or light.

United States Air Intelligence Information Report
Date of Information: 25 March 1952
Source: Captain William F. Byars
SUMMARY: (Based on the observed and reported reactions of other persons, not personal observations) During the conduct of mission IC-52, the pilot-observer of a T-33 aircraft was alerted to the presence of an unidentified flying object. This object was first observed traveling at a speed greatly in excess of that of the T-33 aircraft. The object maneuvered in a manner which indicated controlled flight and remained in the area for a period of approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from the radar scope in a position reciprocal to the T-33 aircraft and remained visible.

Inasmuch as no aircraft or other object was in a position to produce a shadow on the radar scope, it is the belief of the observer that this was an electronic phenomenon reflecting such an image. No further investigation was considered.

DATE 29-72-2

2. On the night of 25 March 1952, B-29 aircraft #44-69991, piloted by Captain B-0, was sighted by radar on the 509th Air Force Operations Center (AFOC) scopes while the aircraft was maintaining an altitude of 33,000 feet. This aircraft was operating in the area between Roswell AAF, New Mexico, and the area 60 miles south of Lubbock, Texas, at the time of the occurrence covered by this report. The observed descent and climb rate of the aircraft indicates the possibility of an additional aircraft either tracking or joining the 8-29 during the period covered by this report.

3. While a portion of the time the aircraft was out of radar contact. At 2329I on 25 March 1952, it reappeared on the radar scopes of the control center for approximately seven minutes. During this period the aircraft appeared to be executing an orbit or circling maneuver to the east. At 2336I the aircraft again disappeared from radar contact.

4. The Radar Observer states that at no time did the unidentified aircraft make a firing pass at the bomber nor was the bomber aircraft ever within gun range of the unidentified target.

5. Observing the unidentified aircraft at the 30 year interval declassification mark, DOD DIR 5200.10.

4. The right observer states that because of the darkness of the night and the limited visibility, it was necessary to estimate the position and distance of the object, which was stated to be approximately 800 to 1000 yards from the ground observer. He was unable to use a jet exhaust as there is not believe that the object squirted flames toward the ground as was at first assumed.

5. The object exhibited an oscillating or quivering motion which was considerably slower than the characteristic oscillating motion of aircraft, and the luminosity seemed to wax and wane at irregular intervals for periods of about two seconds. The object maintained an approximately fixed position above the bombers.

6. The visual observation confirms the presence of the unidentified objects, both through visual sighting and also verifying a sooner in the radar scope. The position confirm the presence of the unidentified objects, both through visual sighting and also verifying a sooner in the radar scope.

RECOMMENDATIONS
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT GOUGH BE QUESTIONED FURTHER BECAUSE
OF HIS CONFUSION ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND TO FIND OUT IF
HE HAS ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH HE DID NOT MENTION.
SINCE GOUGH THOUGHT IT WAS A LIGHT JET AND MISSILE AS HIS FIRST
EXPLANATION, HIS LATER CHANGED MIND ABOUT IT BEING SOME OTHER
AERIAL OBJECT IS QUESTIONABLE.

ABOUT LIKE A DC-6
1. GOUGH CLAIMS HIS WIFE AND NEIGHBOR, MR. BURLEW, ALSO OBSERVED
THE OBJECT DURING ITS FLIGHTS IN THE SKY.
2. GOUGH CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN A GREAT AIRBORNE "THING" OR
STRUCTURE WHICH HE DESCRIBES AS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DC-6.
3. IT WAS SATURDAY APRIL 12 OVER THE ROCKY MT. BETWEEN
3:10 AND 3:20 AM WHEN HE OBSERVED THIS LUMINESCENT OBJECT DISK.
4. THE OBJECT MADE SOME RAPID MANEUVERS AND WAS TRAVELING AT
CONSIDERABLE SPEED AT TIMES.
5. GOUGH WAS MYSTIFIED TO SEE THIS STRANGE OBJECT AND COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS. HE COULDN'T LAUGH AT STORY.

BUT GOUGH AND WIFE SAW NOTHING.
AND WHICH CAUSED SHOCK HORROR WILDLY - GIPSON'S WIFE DID MENTIONED. NEITHER
MAY WIFE NOR I RECALL ANY UNUSUAL NOISE.
SHOULD HE AND WIFE BE INTERVIEWED? CONSISTENT VIBRATION

Gribbon Island, Md.
24 April 1952

Dear General:

Re: Flying Saucers

Witness: 
_____ Pratt
Baltimore, Maryland  

Scene: Ritchie Highway, opposite Herron's Racing Park near Glen Burnie
Date: Saturday, 19 April 1952. Approx. 10:30 p.m. (Corresponded to 29 March 1952)

Witness, with companion was driving an English Ford toward Baltimore. He heard a roaring sound overhead like "a huge vacuum cleaner gone wild". Looking out he saw overhead a great disk "high" shaped like a huge pancake. Suddenly it turned on edge and with great speed it plunged down till it reached about 200 ft. over the car. The disk, seen from its ends, had a large bubble with an aperture like a spotlight too bright to look at. A hissing sound was too deafening to carry on any conversation. The edges were "pale green luminescence" and a luminous after-trail pulsated. The object hovered about two minutes over the automobile which in the meantime had become immobilized. Suddenly the disk took off in a rapid flight toward Gibson Island or Annapolis. Opposite a yellow automobile proceeding toward Annapolis was similarly immobilized. Witness shouted at occupants, a young man and woman who closed their windows and appeared to look their doors, but a minute or so later started their car and took off. Witness was interviewed by Lou Corbin, a radio station (WCBM) announcer. Corbin is a reserve GIG officer and up to date is keeping the story. Corbin first phoned a technical friend at Glen L. Martin's and received an impression that he took the story seriously but did not give any logical explanation. Corbin intends to go over the car engine with a Geiger counter because the car now gives off a "rough rattle" and a garage mechanic said that the metal appears to be magnetized.

Witnesses claim to have seen a great airborne disk about 50 ft. in diameter between 10 and 11 p.m. Saturday, April 19, "over Story Creek Bridge". Disk had luminescent edges and gave off an unsteady luminous green exhaust. Disk was seen about 200 ft. in the air and took off "with the speed exceeding that of a jet plane toward Annandale."

Comment
I will try to find these witnesses and question. Reported to be angry because neighbors laughed at story.

Though I was on Gibson Island at the times mentioned, neither my wife or I recall any unusual noises, and we heard it or felt any vibrations we would have identified at as noises and shocks that we have been attributing to aberrictions. The police say, have had many similar incidents reported, but laugh then off. A news post telephone operator refused to be interested in stewart's story, said he had heard a "dozen similar" incidents on Saturday evening and dismissed them all as hallucinations.

Subject: Notes for Record of Baltimore Sighting

1. This investigation was requested by Col. Cook for Gen. Anderson and is to be given top priority. A report will be requested on Tuesday, 13 May 1952, by 1/f. At about 1230 hrs on Friday, 9 May 1952, Lt Col Fred Taylor called Lt Col Free of OSI Headquarters in Washington. (Gordon 9600 or Code 1452, Ext. 140, Bldg T-6)
The call was made from the Pentagon. Col Taylor gave Col Free details of the request over the telephone. At 1700 hrs Lt Ruppelt delivered a copy of the info to Col Free.
At that time Lt Ruppelt requested to accompany an investigator to interrogate the source but was unable to do so due to OSI policy. It was understood that Col Free called Lt Gallion at 4th District OSI to handle the matter and that they would in turn get in touch with their Baltimore detachment. Lt Ruppelt was also advised that the source could not be located and was possibly gone for the weekend. In view of this, Lt Ruppelt changed his plans to go to Baltimore on Friday night and returned to the hotel in Washington to await further developments.

2. At about 0930 on the 10th, Saturday, Lt Ruppelt again called Col Free. At this time he was told that OSI would try to locate the source on Saturday, possibly in the morning. Since an independent attempt by Lt Ruppelt to locate the source, and duplicate the OSI investigation was not practical, Lt Ruppelt decided to return to W-P AFB on Saturday, p.m. In addition, he was scheduled for duty officer and his orders had expired. He returned and made reservations on a T-34 flight to Baltimore for Monday, the 12th.

4. At 1000 hrs on Sunday, 11 May 52, Lt Ruppelt contacted 4/A Stringer, duty agent for 5th LO OSI at W-P AFB in an attempt to find out whether or not there were any results from Saturdays attempt to locate the source. It was decided that since it was Sunday the best thing would be to wait until Monday morning and call 4th LO in Bolling and get the latest developments before leaving for Baltimore.
