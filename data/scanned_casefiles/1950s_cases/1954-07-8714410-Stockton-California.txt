a landing at Griffiss Air Force Base.

As the pilot started a descent, he noted that the cockpit temperature increased abruptly. The increase in temperature caused the pilot to scan the instruments. The fire warning light was on and the pilot informed the radar observer of this fact. The fire warning light remained on after the throttle was placed in "idle" so the engine was shut down and both crew members ejected successfully.

The text I can see on this document is the title "BOMBING DATA FOR 180A" at the top of the form. The form appears to be a blank bombing data record sheet with various columns such as:

- Bomb Release
- Aiming Point
- Target Chart Reference Number
- Bombing Altitude
- Aircraft True Head
- Offset Value
- True Air Speed
- Stop Watch
- Type Bomb
- Pre-Set
- Aiming Circular Error

The form is completely blank with no data filled in. There are multiple rows and columns for recording detailed bombing mission information.

At the bottom of the form, there are sections for:
- Remarks Concerning Bombing by This Aircraft
- Remarks Concerning Bombing by Other Aircraft

The document appears to be an official military form for recording bombing mission details.
