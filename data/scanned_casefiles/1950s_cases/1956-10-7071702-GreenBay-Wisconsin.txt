ATIC FORM 329 (REV 28 SEP 52)


- page 1 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

Winds 1 (partially legible)

120105 56 (appears to be a number/date stamp)

12 21 56 (another date stamp)

3AE4 (handwritten at bottom right)

3 4 x 2 (handwritten below 3AE4)

Most of the other text on the page is too illegible or faint for me to confidently transcribe.

Here's the text I can discern from the document:

[Top right corner]

[Bottom right area]
Note:

[A large portion of the text is illegible or cut off, with mostly dots/bullet points visible down the left side of the document]

[A black horizontal line is redacted/blacked out at the bottom of the page]

The document appears to be a partially obscured or incomplete page from a UFO-related report, with significant portions of text not clearly readable.
