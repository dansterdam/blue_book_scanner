2. An unusually bright-as-ivory high intensity was seen by the control tower operator at Randolph AFB near San Antonio, Central Standard time, 23 July 1952. The light was white with a bluish cast near the outside edges and only appeared to move up and down but never horizontally. This object was also seen by a pilot flying in the area at the same time. Later thoughts to have been picked up on the radar scope of the ground controller in the local AC and W station. The ground controller later identified a DC-3 on his scope in approximately the same position as the unidentified object.

3. This is the sixth reported sighting made to this headquarters in the San Antonio area since 25 May 1952. This is the first time no high and coordination between a ground visual observer, a ground electronic observer and an airborne visual observer who were in agreement on sighting the same object at the same time.

1. At approximately 1100 hours, 23 July 1952, the Wing Intelligence Office at Randolph Air Force Base was notified by phone that an unidentified object had been reported near Randolph by the control tower operator early that same morning. The airman having gone off duty was sought at his home and asked to report to Air Intelligence. Interrogation was conducted at 1350 hours, 23 July 1952.

2. The interrogation revealed that in unusual light of very high intensity was seen in AND Form 164 on duty in the Randolph Control Tower during the light of 27, 28 July 1952. The object sighted was described as elongated in shape (about 1/4 inch across to the mind's eye) and appeared as a brilliant white light with a blunt nose. Only one (1) was sighted and the observer was unable to determine any aerodynamic characteristics. It had no swirl or exhaust. He was unable to determine its propulsion system or speed. However, he conversed that it had a rapid acceleration in both ascent and descent but that there was no horizontal movement. He stated its disappearance as drifting slightly to the south then climbing until it was out of sight. He heard no sound whatsoever. After 1 facts gathered the object as projecting an intensive focused beam of light which seemed to be sweeping the area from North to South, but it did not strike the terrain at any time.

3. The tower operator first sighted the object at 0053 Central Standard Time, 23 July 1952 and observed the light for thirty-two (32) minutes. He noted the contact was with Aircraft Central and turning site in the area who turned on their radar scope at still later time. Central Standard Time, to attempt contact with the object. The other was in contact with a C-47 pilot who fairly in the local area who claimed he observed the same thing. The pilot of the C-47, Captain S. E. Hanes, the ground controller, Captain R. S. Haggett, and Airman Tyson were all interviewed with contact with the object. Pratt heard that the controller had a positive return on his scope and had tracked the C-47 in pursuit of the target. He claimed the object was on a track which would get the C-47 (destination from the Randolph Central Control landing site or Randolph). The controller gave the distance as about sixty (60) miles. Its altitude was estimated at about seven thousand (7000) feet. The object at the time of or on the same point of or on the same point of an aircraft (1) mile per minute, but remained a point seven (7) miles from the target, the light disappeared from the sight of pilot Tyson. It then remained the same. Unidentified as a return on his scope, which was in the same position of the object he had been following, as an aircraft. This interview was later identified as a DC-6. Because of this no report was made by Captain Haggett.

4. Later information or follow up by this office revealed that he was knowledgeable of a transverse inversion in the area that morning. This inversion, accounted to his first sighted point, had it not been visible, would have been picked to a near ... as identified with this inversion as same or on ... in this area of objects.

4. Airman Pratt's manner of observation was visual from the surface. Type of ground radar equipment used by Captain R. S. Hoagatt is unknown by this office.

5. The observer, located in the Randolph Air Force Base Control Tower, was facing the light east of the time which appeared to be on a magnetic heading of about 210(60) degrees. This was determined by the fact that he was facing perpendicular to the runway heading which is one hundred and forty (140) degrees magnetic, and he first sighted the light about two (10) degrees to his right.

6. WO Jeffery D. Pratt, AF 19260619, is a Senior Control Tower Operator at Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. Prior to his present job, he has three (3) years. He is very familiar with most all types of military aircraft and was very positive in stating that it would not have been a landing light of any aircraft. A/1C Samuel Cox, also a tower operator, was present with Pratt and confirms all of the observer's statements. Navy has a approximately two and one-half (2 1/2) years of tower operating time.

7. The weather at Randolph during the sighting was clear, visibility fifteen (15) miles, surface winds south southeast at seven (7) knots.

8. No meteorological conditions were present to account for the sighting by the ground observers. However, a more detailed check of the Randolph weather, after interviews of the Air Force Control and Tower side, revealed that a temperature inversion was recorded in their 0900 observation on 25 July 1952. The inversion took place between 2,000 and 3,200 feet, and at that time the sun was at an azimuth of 104 degrees. Investigation revealed that a somewhat unusual astronomical phenomena took place during the early morning hours of the 20th of July. The planet Jupiter could be first sighted on the horizon about 0430, 26 July 1952. Its true position, as seen by observer located at Randolph and facing North would have been seventy-five (75) degrees. It was described by competent navigators as being very bright and sparkling. Closed, it appears to be similar and loose edge of its intensity as it rises in the sky.

9. No frequency data nor any photographs taken.

10. No tracking data or interception motion was taken other than the western edge of the USAF City limits and the subsequent identification of a return on the ground controller's radar screen of a B-25 located in the approximate direction of the scientific light.

11. The traffic in the immediate area was one (1) B-25 landing at Randolph. Those pilots was unable to definitely distinguish the light. Other traffic was the T-6 (approximately 10, above). Located more than sixty-six (66) miles from San Antonio on the ground controller's radar screen.

12. The reporting source will make no wave to installation. The Air and has had some interesting information in this instance. However, certain astronomical and meteorological phenomena brought out in this report warrants special consideration in evaluating this airman's story and his reporting accuracy.

C E R T I F I C A T E

I, LeRoy D. Pratt, Airman First Class, AF 19140619 assigned to the 3523-4 AACS Detachment at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas do hereby certify that the following statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

While on duty as Senior Operator in the control tower at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas between the hours of 2330, 27 July and 0700 hours, 28 July,
I made the following observations:

At 0050 hours on the 28th of July, a B-25 type aircraft, serial number 6315, neared the traffic pattern at Randolph Air Force Base to land. As the airplane turned on its crosswind leg at 0053 hours, I noticed an exceptionally brilliant light above and to the right of the aircraft, Southeast of the station. I requested information from the pilot of B-25 concerning the light. He was unable to see the light from his side. In the meantime, the pilot of a C-97 airplane, number 2608 (date) overhead the transmission and advised that he was over Kelly Air Force Base at 3,500 feet. He advised that he was leaving Kelly area to see if he could get closer to it. He began to climb toward the light and passed Randolph at 8,500 feet. I then called San Antonio Control Center and advised of the situation. Mr. E. P. Shaw, controller in the center, advised me to make my report as complete as possible as it was being recorded for transmission to Washington D. C.

After advising CAA, I then called the A.O. here, and he came to the tower at approximately 0135 hours.

In the meantime the C-97 had continued his pursuit to 15,500 feet and we had advised him to contact Detail Control on "B" channel. The switch and contact were actually completed, the aircraft, myself, and Detail Control, began to attempt closure with the object.

My description of the object agreed with the pilot of the C-97, a brilliant, white, bright intensity light, seen to be sweeping from North to South. The shape of the light was elongated and rather elliptical. It continued to climb and descended rapidly.

Detail Control advised that they had a definite object on their scope and were getting a good return. They also had the aircraft "closing" with the object at the approximate rate of one mile per minute. Then "Detail Control" reported that the aircraft was seven miles from the object it now busy on their scope and disappearing alternately. At the same time, I observed "the object" counter clockwise swing and ascend at a terrific rate until out of sight. The aircraft continued its search with the assistance of the tower and Kelly Control, but was unable to relocate the object.

After a quick check with the navigator of the C-97 I decided that 15 mile plane "upiter", overlook previously because of concentration upon the other light.

I was unable at any time to estimate either the altitude or distance of the object from the field due to my not knowing the intensity of the light.

Radar at Detail Control, under supervision of Captain Hoggatt, determined the position of the object at one time as 60 miles from the field at a bearing of 048° Magnetic.

The pilot of the C-97 was Captain W. S. Tyson, 1256th Mats, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. Captain Hoggatt was in the 157th AC & W Squadron. My aircraft observer was A/1c Samuel Levy, 1924-1 AACS Detachment, Randolph Air Force Base.

I had visual reference with the object for approximately 32 minutes. The weather was clear with 15 miles visibility. My final report to the control center was at 0225 hours, 23 July 1952.

STATEMENT

Aircraft # 2608, a C-97, departed Kelly Air Force Base at 0645 hours, Central Standard Time, on a routine training flight. Shortly after take off, we overheard Randolph AF Base Tower on conversation with a third person. They were concerned over a lighted object in the vicinity and we then noticed a bright light off our right side. Randolph Tower mentioned something about flying saucers so we decided to investigate.

The object gave off a bright light and gave the appearance of rapid ascent as we flew toward it.

We climbed to an altitude of 12,000 feet at which time we lost sight of the object behind clouds. We picked it up again and began that time, the pilot, while the navigator checked his charts to determine if a planet should be in the approximate location, we proceeded to climb to 18,500 feet at which time the navigator confirmed the object as the Planet Jupiter.

Meanwhile Detail Radar Control joined with Randolph Tower in observation. We learned then of our confirmation as to Planet Jupiter and proceeded back towards home base. Enroute back, Detail Control informed us of targets on their radar scope and on their directional instructions, we flew intercept course on targets. We identified one target as another aircraft, probably identified another as a cloud. As they had no more targets, we returned to our routine mission.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:
