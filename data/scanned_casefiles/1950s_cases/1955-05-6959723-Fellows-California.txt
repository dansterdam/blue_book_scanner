AISOP Form 5 (15 Oct 54)

Here is the text I can read from the document:

WRITTEN ACTION

Top right corner has handwritten notes:
53114
called: Jacko
2 AT/A
3 AT/A
4½ hrs

The rest of the document contains a list of items, but most of the text is too faint or blurry to read clearly. The page appears to be a form or action document with multiple line items, but the specific details are not legible.


- page 3 -

The text on this page is mostly illegible. I can only clearly make out the number "11." at the top of the page. The rest of the text appears to be blacked out or too faint to read.
