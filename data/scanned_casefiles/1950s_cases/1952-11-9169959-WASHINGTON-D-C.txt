1. The following information is being forwarded to your Headquarters
for whatever action you may deem appropriate.

2. On Saturday, 15 November 1952 at 0240 hours, Captain [redacted] a
Special Agent of the District, OSI, and a pilot with
approximately 1000 hours including combat time, along with his wife,
observed an unidentified aerial object. The object
passed over their house at [redacted] slightly to the East. The
sound, which drew Captain [redacted] to the window of his home, as close as
he could tell, was similar to a B-36 or B-47, or more, as
very low altitude. However, on observing the position of this unidenti-
fied object, its altitude was estimated at 1000 feet, moving in a southerly
direction. All then could be observed was a white or pale light,
having at a speed in excess of any conventional aircraft ever observed by
the Captain or his wife. There were no wing lights and from the angle
first observed, a green, right wing. 11:30 as well as a white light
should have been seen. The total time of observation was some seven (7)
or eight (8) seconds before this craft made a left turn, to the south,
then seemed normal and fade in abnormal "speed" of about a 1/2-degree angle.
Even after the object made its turn, the white light was still observed
but went out slightly after the object started climbing.

3. The weather at the time of observation was clear at point of
observation with an overcast moving in from the west.

ATRC EL-16-52

1. An object was sighted by two observers. It was described by one of them, Maj. R. Wallander, as a round blue light with an orange glow trailing it. The other observer, A/3c Phipps, described the object as an orange colored glow averaging a few comments. Major Wallander sent Airman Phipps for Captain Bellman, so that the Captain could see the object. The object was approximately 1400-1500 feet above and over the approximate center of the runway. It moved in jerky upward sweeps gaining about 40Â° in altitude with each move and paused at the top of each sweep for 10-15 seconds. A/3c Phipps states that on each stop the orange glow was strong out behind the object like a comet's tail. The object disappeared from the 5th after about 5 minutes.

Major Wallander, who was standing nearby, apparently saw the object at a slightly later time, then he sighted it, the object appeared to be hovering over the field in a slightly tilted position. Approximately 20Â° from his position and approximately a mile away. Major Wallander reports that the object was at an elevation of about 200 feet near the city of Wichita and then hovered for approximately two minutes. At this time the bearing of the object was approximately 100Â° with traversing at approximately 350Â°. It hovered here for approximately 120 members, then moved to a position due north of a point approximately 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile distant and out of sight on an approximate course of 350Â° and rising.

Captain Bellman arrived on the scene at the beginning of the last phase. He states that he saw an orange light moving north at various points to be approximately 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile. Then Captain Bellman arrived the light was at an elevation of 50Â° with the horizontal.

2. The sighting occurred at approximately 1022:52 hrs when the object was under observation 5-7 minutes. In the T-6 this was reported as 130215: Nov, but it has since been calculated that the value was 10 minutes alive.

3. The manner of observation was visual.

4. All three observers were located at a position about 3940 feet SE of the SW corner of the Kansas Municipal Airport, Wichita Municipal Airport, 97Â°13'45"W, 37Â°37'15"N.

5. The observers were:
   - Capt. R. Wallander, 11956, Commanding Officer of the 3647 Transition Section, who is a senior pilot current in both the T-33 and B-47 type aircraft and with more than 5,000 hours in the air.
   - Captain A.G. Bellman, AO 310272, a rated AC3, presently current in the B-47.
   - A/3c Dewey J. Phipps, AF 17353313.

Major Wallander and Captain Bellman are both thoroughly reliable and calm. Nothing is known as to Airman Phipps reliability. These men were interrogated separately. In all three cases their accounts were substantially the same, and their evidence is mutually corroborative in the main. Reliability rating A-1.

6. Surface winds were 333 at 16 knots. Visibility CAT/O, high scattered cirrus clouds at 30,000. Winds aloft: 18,000, 265 @ 50 km, 24,000, 265 @ 40 km, 36,000, 265 @ 50 km, 39,000, 235 @ 40 km.

Continued,

7. There were two weather balloons released on the base at 130230Z, one at the Terminal Building and one at the south end of the runway. These balloons were of white nylon and each carried a flashlight with a 3' cord. The light is a bright white, and is small. This type of balloon was carried at approximately 1200' seconds.

8. There is no physical evidence.

9. No interception action was taken.

10. Type aircraft in air at time object was seen were B-47 and T-33. B-47 aircraft were shooting landing. T-33 aircraft unknown.

A/3G Phipps was incorrectly reported in the TX as A/2Q Pebbles. This was due to the fact that the airman could not be located prior to sending the TX, having been off duty, and was mid-identified when inquiries were made at the motor pool.

STATEMENT

11. a. The object was elliptical in shape, single in number and blue-white in color when stationary. Movement was erratic and when motion was observed a red glow appeared opposite the direction. The glow seemed to trail between. Due to the distance from the observers, specific comment as to aerodynamic features cannot be made. The object was observed for between 5-7 minutes. During that time it passed thru an area of 70Â° heading 250Â° to 350Â° and an area of 20Â° above the horizon to 50Â° above.

b. The right peak was erratic. It was this fact that brought the object to the observers attention. It moved at high speed and then stopped. It would reverse direction and hover. It remained north of sights motionless for approximately two minutes.

c. Time of sighting - 20:25 to 20:33

d. Manner of sighting - visual

e. Exact latitude of base - 37Â°38'N
   Exact longitude of base - 97Â°17'W

COMMENTS of Preparing and Approving Officer (name):

12. This report is considered significant because of the reliability and experience of Major Wallander and Captain Ballman, and because the trailing orange glow may indicate a method of propulsion. The weather balloons mentioned in this report have several characteristics. At about the time observed, and will be seen from the listed winds, would have descended a path similar to the one observed, the light attached to each balloon and swinging the one of a 3' cord might account for the jerky movement described by A/3C Phipps. None of these facts, however, explain the reported color or size, nor do they explain, however, the light, as a weather balloon would be constantly rising at a gradually de-celerated rate.

52-100 - (G) Dayton, Ohio, July 30, 1952 - Approximately 4 a.m. a noise
similar to that of 100 flying jet was heard. After noise and caused a
bright white light (described as a thin long line) (P)(?) was
observed moving east from east to west in a clear sky. Light stopped
and became stationary. A second light similar to first was observed
approximately from the same direction but appeared to be somewhat lower.
When second light appeared to be directly below first light, both headed
northwest becoming smaller until disappearance. The observation took
place in the northeast half of the sky. Speed was estimated to be about
as fast as a jet plane.

Wright-Patterson AF Base carried connection with phenomena -
although they had been making photo tests up to 2 a.m. Subsequent check
indicated that despite denial photo tests were still going on at 4 a.m.

feet in diameter. No dependable estimate on actual size or distance
available.

Object described as appearing to circle erratically for about
20 minutes emitting a bluish-white light. No sound or exhaust observed.

Oddly Behaving Meteor Flurry Puzzles Experts in Southwest

By The Associated Press

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Nov. 9 - Unusual number of unusually meteors flashing through southwestern skies these nights has left experts puzzled.

In the last eleven days, seven fireballs have been seen. They slipped through the skies over a seven-state area. The Institute of Meteoritics at New Mexico University said that fragments have been equaled in history.

"In fact," said Dr. Lincoln La Paz, head of the Institute, "there has never been a rate of meteorite fall in history that has been one-fifth as high as the present fall, if this rate should continue, would surpass the phenomenal, not natural."

The fireballs reported by Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Utah and Nevada do not behave "normally." When they should follow a curved course, frequently they are silent, although meteors of that size should make a definite noise. They have a greenish color, he said.

One of the most unusual was the one that swept 125 miles in a straight line across Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada, the fireball vanished in a blinding flash somewhere in northern Arizona. There was no noise.

The most conventional was the one that struck near Oklahoma City Wednesday after being seen in New Mexico, Texas and Colorado. Although it was of greenish color, it made a noise. Dr. La Paz said he hopes ground observers will recover fragments of it. He noted that pieces are recovered from only one in ten large meteorites.

Yesterday's show in southern Arizona and New Mexico was detailed to the Sandia Base. The oddest of the objects, flying parallel, crashed near Chloride, N.M. in the southwest corner of the state, sending up a double mushroom of smoke. Again there was no noise.

"Such a case of two meteors falling together without noise would be hard to duplicate in history," he said. "I don't know what to make of it. I'm almost inclined to ask those fellows out in Nevada (where atomic bomb tests have been recently) what they are doing."

At Washington, the Defense Department was asked if the objects might be rockets or guided missiles fired from test areas at White Sands, N.M., or elsewhere. A spokesman replied the department knew nothing of any tests in the Southwest at the time the flying objects were seen.

Lights Seen in N.Y. Sky
MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., Nov. 9 (JP)âScores of New Yorkers reported seeing a strange light streaking across the sky late this afternoon. Reports described it variously as a "ball of fire," a "reddish 'streak of fire'" and "a bright light high in the sky that took a few minutes to pass from east to west."

The phenomenon was observed over a twenty-mile area from Middletown to Port Jervis, where police said a police "with a bright" about it, leaving a trail, was seen for several minutes vanishing in the direction of Scranton, Pa.

GEOLOGY STUDENT Ted Chamberlain draws picture of fireball he saw while riding in jeep at night

By WALLACE A. SPRAGUE

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. â Was a viewer of after glow-green more arresting than the so-called "flying saucer"?

It is the mystery of the giant green fireball.

Nine of them flashed across the skies of the Southwestern U.S. late last year. Each vanished as though its light had been switched off. No trace of a single one has been found.

People here are used to "mysteries." They live next door to the super-secret atomic energy plant at Los Alamos. At the edge of town is the armed forces' Sandia Base, where the atom bomb is assembled. Across the state is the rocket laboratory of White Sands. They know what technical wonders our scientists can produce.

â¢ But when they see a green ball bright as the moon attracting clearly across their skies, they "know no ordinary event is taking place."

â¢ They know, too, that this is no "flying saucer" hoax, based on flimsy evidence from a few observers. Already, more than 150 separate written reports are on file concerning one giant fireball seen on November 2. Sober scientific observers are beginning to think that the answer to the fireball riddle may mark a milestone in our knowledge of outer space.

â¢ What is the green fireball seen only in our Southwest? A brand new meteor â or something much more frightening, possibly long-range guided missiles or even space vehicles?

One place to start unraveling the mystery is on a farm near standing across the Miera desert one Sunday night last November.

Overhead, stars glistened in the clear, light air. Along the rutted road bundled a result jeep at 25 miles per hour. Riding inside were three University of New Mexico students, Ted Chamberlain (above), a tall, lithe senior in geology, his friend, Gus Armstrong, owner of the jeep, and a third lad, Tom Deboy.

â¢ I was nearly 9, and the youths were returning from an antelope hunt on the San Augustin plains near Magdalena. In the rear of the jeep lay their kill, a medium-sized buck. Suddenly, all three were blinded for a half-second.

"The Jeep Ran Wild"

Far in the Northwest sky burned a giant green fireball falling fast at an angle of about 35 degrees. Its tall was whitish, but the ball itself was the radiant color of a green neon tube-ray, as Chamberlain recalls, of copper burning in a laboratory burner.

"Look!" yelled Armstrong. As he did so he lost control of the jeep, which hit a rut, erupted a fire-foot bank, and dumped its occupants on the gravelly desert. Overhead, the fireball silently vanished. Minutes later the three dazed young men re-started the jeep, and rolled on toward Albuquerque.

On Nov. 4 (see story), ball had deep green head, but headed to lighter green and white toward tail.

"I saw a fireball..."

RAILROAD conductors are not excitable people. Neither are airline pilots. Yet the same night Capts. Craig C. Kelly and Thomas M. Bliard of the Army's TRACER plane saw the same fireball off the left wing of their DC-3 plane as they approached Kirtland field here.

â¢ We both commented at the time that it was by far the brightest meteor we had seen in 10 years of flying," Ballard said later.

â¢ Elsewhere, a convalescent soldier, Bill Henderson, at Ft. Bayard, N.M., watched the ball of fire from his hospital window. An observant 12-year-old girl, Lydia Ann Rife, of Santa Fe, saw it and described its head as "rounded, bluish-green, with an orangey-red tail."

â¢ Scientists at Los Alamos saw the display and reported on it. So did the Civil Aeronautics Administration's tower man at Truth and Consequence, N.M. So did Walter Haas, of Los Cruces, an experienced observer of meteors.

â¢ So did Julian B. Blue Jacket, a Navajo, some western towns based the collapse of a water tower at Tucumcari, N.M. (which killed four), on such a fireball. Investigation showed the flash seen at the moment of collapse came from short-circuited electric lines.

But to all who have seen them, sight of the great green fireball flashing through the heavens is an unforgettable experience.

They, like thousands of other Americans, know, is isn't saying. That goes for the giant Atomic Energy Installation at Los Alamos, and for the careful technicians at Sandia Base here. The Department of Defense is also mum, although various intelligence and scientific agencies of the government have shown interest in the fireball mystery.

But one authority will speak. He is Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, a friendly, intense scientist of world reputation who is head of

Here is the OCR text from the document:

) They follow a straight line - where big meteors, penetrating our atmosphere, always have curved trajectories, concave toward the earth.

) Most unusual of all is their green color. The livid shades, as green as a traffic light or neon sign, are absolutely new.

"Occasionally observers might pass off the green fireballs merely as Bield meteors which will early in November," says Dr. LaPaz.

"Actually, they're like no Bield ever seen before. Finding them with the Bields is about like watching a 240-mm howitzer firing bright green starballs during a bombardment of red-hot B-B shot."

Such facts lead to one conclusion: If the green fireballs are meteors, they are of an absolutely new type. Their coming may mean that the solar system (including our earth) has lately reached a new corner of the universe where totally unexpected events can occur.

GREEN FIREBALLS may continue to fall. Should you observe one, write a description of the circumstances and mail it to:

Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, Institute of Meteoritics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, N.M.

And science may even have a hint of the "unexpected events."

For 15 years, Dr. LaPaz says, scientists have speculated on the possible existence of what they call "countercurrent" material.

Such material-if any could ever be found and handled, which is impossible-would look just like ordinary matter.

But it would be matter built backward. Where the nucleus of ordinary atoms has a positive charge, its nucleus would have a negative charge. And where ordinary electrons have a negative charge, countertrene electrons would have a positive charge.

This means just one thing: the instant countertrene matter struck ordinary matter, a terrible explosion would occur!

"Could this be the explanation of the swift, probably safe passage with a new meteor," suggested by Dr. Louis Ridenour in 1945. The missiles could appear to "hide" behind detectors, and so could not easily be detected by radar.

Last fall's fireball display did occur during the annual visit of the Bielid meteor shower.

â¢ Fact 1: Green fireballs have been observed only once before - in 1846, when they were reported seen over the Baltic Sea and Sweden.

Military commentators were quick to suggest that the Russians might well be testing advanced types of missiles captured from the Germans at their nearby rocket base of Peenemunde.

Suppose the green fireballs do give away some gigantic new secret of guided missiles or space travel? Who is responsible?

Again, because of the nearness of USA scientific centers, the temptation is great to say they're ours. But Dr. LaPaz says this: "If the Russians possessed missiles capable of intercontinental flight, it would be natural for them to make ranging tests over the Southwestern U.S., where we have important targets."

Why They Disappear

If the Russians have such rockets, it would also be perfectly natural for these devices to be made self-destroying, so that we could find only tiny fragments of them.

"We must try to do as we have done with countless celestial objects before," says Dr. LaPaz. "We must find a piece of one and examine it in a scientific laboratory."

â¢ "We already know of several places to look. But to search effectively, we must have as many as 5,000 men, who can examine the stream field yard by yard, and foot by foot. And even then, if the trails are continuous, we shall have no success.

â¢ "But if we find bits of metallic alloy which could burn with a green flame, we may well have a piece of a green fireball.

â¢ "And from this place we can surely say whether it originated in space, or in some frighteningly advanced laboratory.

"For science, and for our own safety, we should make such a search soon." â

6 secret space war?

the Mathematics and Astronomy department at the University of New Mexico here, and also Director of the University's unique Institute of Meteorites (meteor studies). He says this:

1 The green fireballs of 1951 could be a brand new kind of meteor.
Certainly they differ from ordinary fireballs - big meteors bright enough to cast a shadow and which usually end in an explosion.

They're different because:
â¢ They are more brilliant - some reported much bigger and brighter than the moon.
â¢ Ordinary fireballs are rarely this impressive.
â¢ They are silent, when ordinary fireballs of comparable size fall with a roar.
â¢ They follow a straight line - where big meteors, penetrating our atmosphere, always have curved trajectories, concave toward the earth.
â¢ Most unusual of all is their green color. The livid shades, as green as a traffic light or neon sign, are absolutely new.

"Conservative observers might pass off the green fireballs as merely Bield meteors, which fall early in November," says Dr. LaPaz.

"Actually, they're like no Bield ever seen before. Finding them with the Bields is about the watching a 164-mile border firing bright green starshells during a bombardment of red-hot B-B shot."

Such facts lead to one conclusion: if the green fireballs are meteors, they are obviously not typical meteors. Their coming may mean that the solar system (including our earth) has lately reached a new corner of the universe.

4 traceless green fireball? If it is, it would form one of the most dramatic scientific discoveries of our time.

But there is another possible explanation, Dr. LaPaz thinks:

2 The green fireballs could be thrown by man-ominously enough in the form of guided missiles.

In the region of White Sands Proving Ground and the Sandia Weapons Base, such a hypothesis is tempting. But Dr. LaPaz does not endorse it. He does, however, offer two suggestive facts:

â¢ Fact 1: Any tests of long-range guided missiles by friendly or enemy countries would probably take place during a meteor shower, as suggested by Dr. Louis Ridenour in 1944. The missiles could appear to "hide" behind meteors, and so could not be easily be detected by radar.

Last fall's fireball display did occur during the annual visit of the Bield meteor shower.

â¢ Fact 2: Green fireballs have been observed only once before - in 1946, when they were reported seen over the Baltic Sea and Sweden.

Military commentators then were quick to suggest that the Russians might well be testing advanced types of missiles captured from the Germans at their nearby rocket base of Peenemunde.

Suppose the green fireballs do give away some gigantic new secret of guided missiles or space travel? Who is responsible?

Again, because of the nearness of U.S. satellite centers, the temptation is great to say they're ours. But Dr. LaPaz says: "If the Russians possessed missiles capable of intercontinental flight, it would be natural for them."

THESE PEOPLE SAW THEM IN THE SKY:

Hydro-graphic Bulletin

Third Officer Barry W. Pillinger of the American S. S. Alcoa Ranger, Capt. Joseph M. Castro, Master, reports as follows:

"Among the large number of meteors observed on the morning of November 15, 1952, the following was the most unusual:

0810 G. M. T., in lat. 22Â°22' N., lon. 85Â°13' W., a bright meteor originating in the constellation Leo, having a duration of 3 seconds, seemingly exploded in the region between Leo and Ursa Major with a pull-apart flash which illuminated the entire area around the vessel. After the flash, a large wing or region has become visible at a serrant altitude of 20Â° and a true bearing of 080Â°. This was an open parallel quadrilateral shape of a horseshoe and remained plainly visible to the naked eye for 30 minutes, initially appearing near area in Leo, Major.

Weather clear, excellent visibility, wind N.E. force 3, slight sea, barometer 29.92 inches, air temperature 76Â° F."

FROM: ADGN-4E

Date: 20 JUN 1958

Comments:

1. Mr. [redacted] sightings were evaluated as "possible balloon."

2. There is a U.S. Weather Bureau Balloon-launching site in Sacramento which possibly launched a balloon November 15, 1952 just prior to his sighting.

3. Re Mr. [redacted] May 20, 1953, sighting in Los Angeles. He states this object descended and came to rest directly over his head at an altitude of five feet. We are sure Mr. [redacted] is at least five feet tall, give or take a couple of inches, in which case it would have been sitting on his head. The object remained motionless for about five minutes at this altitude. It was described as the exact size of a "night football." It must not have frightened him because it wasn't reported until the latter part of 1954.

SUBJECT: FLYOBSPT

In accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBSPT), the following report of Unidentified Flying Objects is submitted:

On 11 November 1952, 2220-2300 MST, Security Inspectors and radio operator at New Mexico, Atomic Energy Commission, Los Alamos, New Mexico, observed a round, light red to the southeast of Los Alamos. New Mexico. The object appeared to be about 50 above the horizon, alternately, apparently motionless except 50 above the horizon. The object was observed by these men of the AEC installations. The meteor width attracted the observers was the changing of colors, somewhat like an different navigation lights, but much brighter and larger. The object remained in a near fixed position for approximately forty (40) minutes, then suddenly disappeared. There was no radar contact with the object.

Two unidentified objects were flying in the Canal Zone area between 23062 on 25 November and 0492 25 November. Estimated speed of objects was 275 knots, with conventional, maneuvered flying between 1000 and 23000 feet altitude. Sightings were made by gun laying radar. Weather was clear with visibility unlimited. Unsuccessful interception was attempted by two B-26s, one B-17 and one F94.

Two unidentified objects were plotted on fan laying radar in the Canal Zone during the period 2362 25 November 1952 - 2459 25 November 1952. Unlike many reports of this type these objects maneuvered in a conventional manner as an optimized speed of 279 knots. During the entire period the weather was clear with visibility unlimited and unobstructed. No attempts to track these objects visually were successful. Intercept was attempted by two B-26s, one T-37, and one F-94 without success.

A transcript of the log at the Air Defense Control Center is as follows:

1237-1900B                                                  25 November 1952

[A long list of coordinates and numbers follows, which appears to be a log of some tracking or plotting activity]

Last point follows: I am not able to have lost positive plots on unidentified object because they are changing from LK to LH. I am not observing them in the log.

[More coordinates and numbers continue]

Main plots from 0430 to 0445 were known to be on AF2656 returning to BLB.

Another transcript of the log at the Air Defense Control Center is as follows:

19OCB-25 Nov. to 1700'8 on 26 Nov.                   25 & 26 November 1952

Continued plotting. No positive identification of object. Last plot of unknown object at 0414Â½. Changed condition yellow to condition white. Guns tight as of 0524.

1 Lt. USAF
Controller on Duty

Captain Eugene D. BRECH, who was on duty at the Air Defense Control Center during the entire period, was interrogated on 25 November 1952. Captain BRECH reported the following:

13028 - AADC was asked to turn on radar earlier than normal to track a light aircraft on a direct flight from Patuxent Calvert Airport to Colon Airport.

14052 - Plot was received from AADC on a target which was coming early off the proposed course of the light aircraft. Flight plans were re-checked and it was determined that no aircraft was scheduled or authorized to be in that area. AADC was asked if the target could be weather. AADC applied that it was a definite target, not a weather item.

13:51 - Tucumcari Airport, "Bruce Galanek Airport" and F2. Radar were contacted for information in any 711 alt. High obs. have been now canceled. All three verified that all flight plans had been submitted.

13:52 - Good Golo tower was contacted and they reported the light aircraft was in their area.

13:58 - Yellow Alert was called

13:58 - A B-17 taking off at Altbrook Air Force Base was requested to proceed to the last target position to investigate the unidentified object.

13:59 - AAC reported that AAA had made two visual sightings. Unable to verify.

14:08 - Targets continued to be plotted and B-17 and two B-25's were vectored to position. Three targets had been plotted. No visual sightings were made from the air.

14:09 - Last unidentified object was plotted.

14:09 - Yellow Alert terminated.

Major James J. GALE, 1355983, Commanding Officer of the 5970 Standby Flight with duty A.F. France AFB reported the following:

At approximately 0330 Major Gale received a phone call from Goce Golo advising him that the unidentified objects were in the France AFB area. Major Gale was unable to make visual contact. The first visual contact was made at 1130 hours, lasting a short time of vision from East to South. The light was yellow in color, giving a sort of hazy appearance. The object was seen by two men from the weather station. It was approximately 3000 feet. The light disappeared in the east in about three (3) seconds. Major Gale stated that he could not have made a visual reflection from a beacon or any similar light since he remained in the same position for some time having to fix a "in and exactly what he had seen". From the 11:30 light was noted. There were scattered clouds at the time with visibility unlimited.

Weather recorded at the Detachment 11, 9th Weather Team station at Altbrook AFB for the period is as follows:

COMMENT of the Preparing Officer:
It was obvious that source had been well trained in observation. He knew what he saw, estimated directions, estimated altitudes, as well as exact time of sighting.

The document appears to be a grid map with coordinates ranging from 00 to 55 in both horizontal and vertical axes. Some notable text on the map includes:

- "LK" and "MK" marked in different grid sections
- "TOCUMEN" near coordinate 30
- "TABOGA IS." near coordinate 24
- "PERLAS" and "ISLADAS" in the bottom right section of the map

The map seems to be of a geographical area, likely in Panama, with various grid references and small island or location markers. The grid is divided into sections with numerical coordinates.

The information given above is true and correct to the best of the observers
ability and knowledge.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
As stated by one of the observers, the object could have been a star, with the
light glittering through a high layer of dust particles. This might account for the
strange appearance. As a balance, no reported by two observers. The observers
remained stationary. No clouds were visible in the sky at the time of the sighting
and other stars were visible. Including the evening star. A complete check was made
of balloon launchings in the western states. Assuming that the winds aloft were
correctly estimated this object could not have been a balloon carrying a beacon or
light. No aircraft were in the area within several hours of the sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

I thought that it was a plane coming in for a landing the motion at this time I didn't see it was very slow and there was a change in color, from bright white to red a green, the same object as when a plane is sighted flying at a slight angle from you, so that the distance between the light could not be determined yet the light from the wing lights could be seen. The object then seemed to remain stationary, and later moved a little to the south. The object was still in the sky at the time I was relieved from duty, and left the area.

Approach from 140Â° (SE)
Elev 315.5Â° for 5Â° here not speed very slow

At approx 2230 station 522 reported a bogey at the SE corner of project. A observed bogey and concluded it was a star, bearing about 140Â° 5Â° above the horizon. The star was flashing red & green and could have been mistaken for running lights of an aircraft.
This area is available for interested observers most any clear night at this time of year.

At 2220 MST here on 11 Nov. 1952 I received a radio report from a patrol in the field of a flashing light which he believed was a bogey. Other reports were received, some of which stated the object was a star. Upon being relieved from duty at approx. 2300 MST, I came out of the building with Sgt. and was observed an object in the east flashing red & green. When I arrived at my home, I pointed this object to my wife and we both observed for a period of about 15 minutes. After this period of time, while my head was turned for a moment, the object disappeared and we did not sight it again before retiring, approx 30 minutes later.
