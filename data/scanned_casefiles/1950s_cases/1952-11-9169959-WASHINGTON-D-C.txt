SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Observed at
Goose Air Force Base on 15 November 1952

1. The following information is being forwarded to your headquarters for whatever action you may deem appropriate.

On 15 November 1952 at approximately 1940 hours, a white lighted object was observed over Goose Air Force Base, Labrador. The object was first seen in the southwest and was observed to move in a northeast direction, reaching a point almost over the base area. The object then reversed direction and moved back to the southwest, finally disappearing from view in the distance.

The object was sighted by several military observers and was under observation for approximately 20 minutes. It was described as an elliptical white light, approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter, with no exhaust or trail. The object was observed to make a 180 degree turn without banking or changing speed. The total time of observation was some seven (7) minutes.

The weather was clear and the object was easily visible against the night sky. This sighting was considered unusual and does not conform to any normal and/or identifiable aerial phenomena. No sound or trail was observed. It was estimated that the object was at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet, moving at a speed of several hundred miles per hour.

2. The weather at the time of observation was clear with visibility in excess of 15 miles. No known aircraft were in the air at the time of the sighting. The object did not appear to be a meteor or conventional aircraft.

3. The activities of the time of observation were given at point of observation with an observer's varying in form the time the same.

On Saturday, 15 November 1952 at 0210 hours, Captain *****[redacted]* of the 4th District OSI and a pilot with approximately 1,000 hours including combat time, along with his wife, observed an unidentified aerial object. The object passed over their house at about 5,000 feet, estimating its speed to be slightly to the east. The object, which was very low altitude, however, on observing the position of this unidentified object, the witness was convinced that the object was moving in a southerly direction. All that could be observed was a white or pale blue light, having a pulsating motion. Captain *****[redacted]* and his wife reported this unidentified aerial sighting to the Director of Intelligence.

3. The weather at the time of observation was clear at point of observation with an overcast moving in from the west.

Intelligence Report
17 Nov 52, Wichita, Kansas

1. An unidentified flying object was observed by two observers. It was described by one of them as:

Major R.L. Gillespie, radar observer, stated that on 9 November 1952 at approximately 23:39 hours, he observed a bright light in the sky, which at first appeared to be a falling star, but later increased in size and then decreased in size. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. It appeared to be much larger than a star and approximately 15 to 20 degrees to the right of zenith, moving from south to north. When it reached a point almost overhead, it suddenly disappeared. No sound was heard, and the object displayed no trail.

2. The sighting occurred at approximately 23:39 hours and the object was under observation for approximately 2 to 3 minutes.

3. The observers were:
Lt. W.G. Holder, Pilot, 3700th AAA Wing, Wichita, Kansas
Major R.L. Gillespie, Radar Observer, 3700th AAA Wing, Wichita, Kansas

4. All three observers were located at a position about 7 to 10 feet of the 3-47 transition area, operating in conjunction with a ground controlled approach (G.C.A.) approach at approximately 23:39 hours on 9 November 1952.

5. The observers were:
1st Lt. H.L. Wallace, Jr., Commander Officer of the 3-47 Transition Section.
Captain A.G. Dellinger, IO 7132322, a rated AC, presently current in the 3-47.
1/29 Dewey Jr. Philips, AS 17339313.

The observers stated that they were thoroughly reliable and claim that the object they observed was unusual and could not be identified as any known aircraft or celestial body. Their statements are mutually corroborative in the main, although differing in some details.

September 8, 1952 - Deputy, Chico, California, 8:15 P.M. - Approximately 4 a.m., a noise was heard and investigation by Deputy revealed a strange light in the sky. This light appeared to be elliptical in shape and hovered for approximately 7 to 10 minutes and then became brighter and then suddenly disappeared. This light was estimated to be about the size of a softball, or larger, and pale green in color. No sound was heard. Witness is considered reliable.

Wright-Patterson AFB contact: As base contacted, Commander with personal knowledge of this incident admitted they had two to three similiarONE SUCH INCIDENT occurred in July 1952 but details were classified. This sighting was estimated to be at 4 a.m.

July 29, 1952 - (2) Vicinity of Grand Rapids, Michigan - July 10, 1952 - Approximately 10:30 P.M. A group of responsible persons, including a college professor, observed approximately 75 to 100 circular unidentified objects moving rapidly in a circular pattern at a high rate of speed, about 2,000 to 3,000 feet altitude. Objects appeared to be about 1/2 to 3 feet in diameter and pale blue or white in color.

Object described as appearing to circle practically for about 30 minutes, emitting a bluish-white glow. No sound or outward propulsion means observed. Astronomical lhanges were ruled out. 
 
Witness claim: others saw this object - U.S. is still trying to obtain stories of other witnesses. This ends.

ONE SAUCER-LIKE OBJECT OVER WASHINGTON, D.C.  AUGUST 12-13, 1952

A saucer-like object was observed over Washington, D.C. on the nights of August 12-13, 1952. The object was described as round, saucer-like, and very bright. It was observed by radar and visually by both military and civilian personnel. The object moved rapidly and silently. Entire observation lasted for several hours each night.

The light remained stationary for about 10 to 15 minutes and then shot out of sight toward the East at a high rate of speed.

Text from the document:

Oddly Behaving Meteor Flurry Puzzles Experts in Southwest

ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., Nov. 6 - (AP) - Residents of the southwestern states were mystified by what seemed like a meteor shower through the skies over a wide area last night.

Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, director of the University of New Mexico's Institute of Meteoritics, said the frequency has never been observed before on such a scale, although individual meteors are common.

He said the rate of meteors, which he estimated were traveling at 20 to 30 miles per second, was so high it would suggest the phenomenon is not an ordinary meteor shower.

The fireball, reported by observers in several southwestern states, did not conform to the irregular pattern of ordinary meteors at all. Dr. LaPaz said they moved in parallel lines and crashed one after the other like a series of tracer bullets, lighting up the southwest corner of the state.

At Washington, the Defense Department said the strange performance was not explainable at the moment and "further study" would be required.

A spokesman replied the department knew nothing of any tests or the like in the southwest at the time.

MIDDLETOWN, Ohio, Nov. 6 (AP) - Mrs. Roy C. Campbell, who saw the phenomenon at Woodsfield, Ohio, tonight, said the streaks "looked like long flashes from the sky, extending for miles and coming in a straight line."

"The phenomenon was observed again tonight," she said. "The flashes came in very rapidly, one after the other, and resembled powerful floodlights sweeping the sky from the southwest."

RAILROAD conductors are not excitable peo-

same night Capts. Grady C. Kelly and
Thomas T. Ballard of Stick Airways watched
the same fireball off the left wing of their DC-3
plane as they approached Midland Field here.

"We both commented at the time that it
was by far the brightest meteor we had seen
in 10 years of flying," Ballard said later.

Elsewhere, a convalescent soldier, Bill Ben-
derson, at Ft. Bayard, N.M., watched the ball
of fire from his hospital window. An observant
12-year-old girl, Livinia Ann Rife, of Santa Fe,
saw it and described it as "rounded,
bluish-green, with an orange-red tail."

Scientists at the Los Alamos Village are display-

So did Nathan B. Blue Jacket, a Navajo.

Some newsmen blamed the balls they saw to
faults over at Tularosa, N.M. (which killed
four persons) on such a fireball. Investigation showed
the flash seen at the moment of collapse came
from short-circuited electric lines.

But to all who have seen them, sight of the
great green fireballs flashing through the
heavens is an unforgettable experience. 

"They, like thousands of other Americans
here, have wondered what they are.
No government source knows—or if any does

The text indicates that this is a geologist student named Ted Chamberlain who drew a picture of a fireball he saw while riding in a jeep at night. The rest of the text describes various accounts of sightings of "green fireballs" or unusual meteor-like objects in the sky over New Mexico in 1952.

The text from the document is as follows:

"Do green fireballs hint

GEOLOGY STUDENT Ted Chamberlain draws picture of fireball he saw while riding in jeep on night
BY WALLACE A. SPRAGUE

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.
WE FACE A MYSTERY of outer space even more astonishing than the unsolved "flying saucers."
It is the mystery of the giant green fireballs.
Nine of them flashed across the skies of the range guided missiles or even space vehicles?
One place to start unraveling the mystery is on a cliff reaching across the New Mexico
desert one Sunday night last November.

Continued, stars glittering in the clear light
air. Along the rutted road thundered a rebuilt
jeep at 55 miles per hour carrying three young
scientists from Los Alamos.

Something similar had almost happened to Lester Miller and his wife, of Palo Alto, Calif., had been driving east on Highway 60
near Globe, Ariz. 

Not long after, they, too, saw a great
bluish-green burst overhead. "It was so intense
that I nearly drove off the highway. I was temporarily blinded," said Mr. Miller.

This was no ordinary meteor display. 
Watchers across a 1,000-mile span from San
Fe, N.M., to Vista, Calif., watched the green
fireball flame in the heavens.

Conductor J. B. Hale of a Santa Fe freight
train was sitting at his desk aboard a caboose
at Flagstaff, Ariz.

"One of the brakemen outside yelled for
me to hurry up, for a terrible looking bluish-green flash had just lit up the sky," he reported.

"I saw a fireball ..."

RAILROAD conductors are not excitable people. Neither are airline pilots. Yet the same night Capts. Grady C. Kelly and Thomas R. Baker of Continental Airlines watched the same fireball on the left wing of their plane as they approached El Paso.

"We both commented at the time that it
was by far the brightest meteor we had seen
in 10 years of flying," Ballard said later.

Elsewhere, a convalescent soldier, Bill Henderson, at Ft. Bayard, N.M., watched the ball
of fire from his hospital window. An observant
12-year-old girl, Lavinia Ann Rule, of Santa Fe,
saw it and described its head as "rounded,
bluish-green, with an orange-red tail."

Scientists at Los Alamos have made the discovery that these green fireballs were not ordinary shooting stars but were something different, something that could be guided missiles or even space vehicles."

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a declassified UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"FFEBRUARY 10,1952 - PARIS, Va 12:35 E.S.T. - Two separate green fireballs penetrating our atmosphere, always have excited fascination. Concave the earth - like watching a B-B shot. Most unusual of all is their green color. The vivid shades, as green as a traffic light or neon sign, are so acutely green that "conservative observers might pass off the green fireball as merely green meteors, which fall early in November," says Dr. LaPaz.

Actually, they're like no bright star seen before. Finding them with the Shields is about like watching a 6-inch moon through bright green starshells during a bombardment of red-hot B-B shot.

Such facts lead to one conclusion: If the green fireballs are real, they are of an absolutely new type. Their coming may mean that the solar system (including our earth) has lately reached a new corner of the universe where totally unexpected events are occurring.

GREEN FIREBALLS may continue to fall and science may even have a hint of the "unexpected events". For 15 years, Dr. LaPaz says, scientists have speculated on the possible existence of what they are calling "extraterrestrial" material. Such material, if any could be found, might be radioactive like the natural matter. But it would be neither built backward, just like ordinary matter.

Where the nucleus of ordinary atoms has a positive charge, its nucleus would have a negative charge. And where ordinary electrons we a negative charge, counterbalance electrons would have a positive charge.

This means just one thing: the instant contact between this "extraterrestrial" matter and terrestrial explosion would occur!

"Could this be the explanation of the swift, missiles penetrating our atmosphere, always have entered jaegadly concave the earth - where big sudden last fall's fireball display did occur during the annual visit of the Shield audience above." 

Fact 2: Green fireballs have been observed only once before — in 1948, when they were reported seen over the Baltic Sea and Sweden.
Military commentators then were quick to suggest that the Russians might be testing advanced types of missiles originated from Germany at their nearby Peenemünde.

Suppose the green fireballs do give away some gigantic new secret of guided missiles or space travel? Who is responsible?

Again, because of the nearness of U.S. scientific centers, the temptation is great to say they're ours. But Dr. LaPaz says this: "If the Russians possessed missiles capable of intercontinental flight, it would be natural for them to make ranging tests over the Southwestern U.S., where we have important targets."

Why They Disappear

If the Russians have such rockets, it would also be perfectly natural for these devices to be made self-destroying, so that we could find only tiny fragments of them. How can we solve the riddle?

"We must try to do as we have done with countless celestial objects before," says Dr. LaPaz. "We must find a piece of one and examine it in a scientific laboratory."

But to search effectively, we must have aid. Is it possible, he wonders, that some person has picked up fragments of "strewn field" yard by yard, and foot by foot. And even then, if the fireballs are contraterrestrial matter, we shall have no success.

"But if we do find bits of metallic alloy which could burn with a green flame, we may well have a piece of a green fireball."

And from this piece we can surely say whether it originated in space, or in some frighteningly advanced laboratory.

"For science, and for our own safety, we should make such a search soon."

- page 26 -

The image does not contain any photographs, only text and illustrations. The text appears to be an article discussing the possibility of a "secret space war" and the nature of green fireballs observed by the Mathematics and Astronomy department at the University of New Mexico.

The text includes the following information:

A secret space war?
The green fireballs of 1948 could be a brand new kind of meteor, according to the Mathematics and Astronomy department at the University of New Mexico. They say the green fireballs are more brilliant and bigger than the moon, and that ordinary fireballs are rarely this impressive.

The green fireballs could be thrown by man-made guided missiles, or they could be "ghost-like" where big meteors penetrating our atmosphere always have curved trajectories, according to Dr. Lincoln LaPaz.

Most unusual of all is their green color. The fireballs, as green as a traffic light or neon sign, are absolutely rare.

Conservative observers pointed out that the green fireballs as magnetic field meteors, which they often describe as "Lucifers".

If the green fireballs are meteors, they are of an unidentified type, and their coming may mean that the solar system (including our earth) has been invaded from the outer corners of the universe. This, it is suggested, could occur.

Again, because of the nearness of U.S. scientific centers, the temptation is great to say they're ours. But Dr. LaPaz says: "If the Russians possessed missile capable of continental flight, it would be natural for them to want to test it by sending it across the skies of the United States."

This image does not appear to contain a photograph, but rather a written report. The report describes an observation made on November 9, 1952 by Third Officer Barry W. Pillinger of the American S.S. Alcoa Regency. The report details the observation of a bright, metallic object originating in the constellation Leo, which produced a flash and trail of sparks before disappearing. The object was observed for several seconds and was described as clearly visible to the naked eye.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

Hypo-cerebls BULLETIN

Third Officer Barry W. Pillinger of the American S.S. Alcoa Regency reports as follows: 

Among the large number of meteors observed on the morning of November 9, 1952, the following was the most unusual: At 0510 N.A., a bright metallic object originating in the constellation Leo, having a duration of 3-4 seconds, descended diagonally from the upper left toward the lower right, becoming brighter as it appeared to slow down, and then suddenly disappearing. At the flash, a large ink of sparks seemed to fan out around the vessel. After the flash, a large ball of reddish gas became visible as a crescent, following the track of the object, which then disappeared. This crescent remained visible for 20 to 30 seconds. Estimating the distance of the object, Pillinger judged it to be over 50 miles away. The object was of such brilliance that it was plainly visible to the naked eye for the entire 3-4 second duration. Weather clear, excellent visibility, wind NE force 3, slight sea.

Barometer 29.92 inches, air temperature 72 F.

3. Mr. -------- reports an 8 to 10 foot sighting in Los Angeles. He states this object was a silver sphere about the size of a basketball, and was at an attitude of five or six inches, in which case it would have been sitting on his head. The object remained motionless for about five minutes. It was described as the same size of a night football. It must not have frightened him because it wasn't reported until the latter part of 1954.

25 November 1552 Incident of 2 Unidentified Objects observed at Washington, D.C. at time between 23:00 and 00:00.

Objects were at an altitude of 300 to 3000 feet. Speeds of 100 mph, no sound, and erratic/interceptive maneuvers.  

It is believed that due to radar units being slightly off calibration and communications interference, the objects were not tracked on radar. 

It is also believed that the majority of the radar plots were legitimate and that the sightings by competent officers were of an unidentified aerial object.

The sighting officer knows of no object which riis at 3/273 knots, moves without sound, and evades interception.

The Inclined Camera charts and radar should aid in verifying position.

Unfortunately, there is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text contained in the document is as follows:

I thought that it was a plane coming in for a landing. The action at the time it first came into view was very slow and there was a change in color, the bright white to red & green, the same effect as when a plane is landing. But the light seemed to maneuver in a little different fashion from a plane, so that the light from the wings would not be determined yet. The light seemed to hover a little in one spot, and then move off rapidly. This continued for about 20 minutes, and the time I was relieved from duty, and left the area.
