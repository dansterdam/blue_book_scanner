AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Sighting of an Unidentified Object

AREA REPORTED ON: Janesville to Madison, Wisconsin
DATE OF REPORT: 15 August 1953    DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 18 August 1953

PREPARED BY (Office): Charles W. Youngson 1/Lt. USAF
REFERENCES: (Other number, directive, previous report, etc. as applicable)

SUMMARY: Interrogation of Mr. and Mrs. Elbridge Bertke, age 32, husband and wife, about the sighting of an unidentified object at 2045 CST, 15 August 1953.

Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] were driving north on Highway #14 approximately 15 miles South of Janesville, Wisconsin, when Mrs. [redacted], looking out of the right car window, saw a strange bright object. The object appeared to have a reddish color or glow like a bright light on a high tower. Mrs. [redacted] immediately called this strange light to the attention of her husband, and they both agreed to observe.

A few minutes after the first sighting, the object seemed to move slowly to the left and then appeared to move very swiftly. The object seemed to move directly in front of the car and appeared a very bright white color, something like an explosion. After the explosion like effect, the object seemed to have a tail like or trail offset. As the object appeared to move away from its front, the object appeared to change from the bright white to an orange color and then to the original reddish color.

Mrs. [redacted] followed down her car window thinking maybe it was a reflection in the glass, but the object appeared just as bright with the car window rolled down.

Mr. [redacted] estimated the object to be at an altitude of 5,000 to 8,000 feet. Except when the object appeared to have the explosion like effect with a tail, the object had a sharp definite outline. In comparison to this object, the stars in the sky appeared very dim and dull. The sky was clear at the time of the observation. At a distance the object appeared to come closer to the earth, but it did not appear any larger, but very much brighter.

The object was constantly under observation from the time of first sighting, 2045 CST, until approximately 2200 CST, when Mr. and Mrs. Bertke arrived in the outer edge of Madison, Wisconsin.

Mrs. [redacted], age 35, is a housewife with several years experience as a Secretary at the University of Wisconsin. Mr. [redacted], age 32, is at present a research assistant at the University of Wisconsin, majoring in Histology-Parasitology and Pathology. Mr. [redacted] served in the 9th Air Force during World War II as a bombardier.
