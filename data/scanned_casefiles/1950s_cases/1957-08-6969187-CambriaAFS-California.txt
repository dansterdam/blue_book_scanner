two

9. COURSE
N/A

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round red and orange objects the size of a pen at arm's length were observed one above the other.

11. COMMENTS
Appears to be an attempt to relate a radar blip with the sighting of an astronomical body, Venus almost exactly in position as obj described. Ndo: Obj observed for 1½ hr.

From facts stated in rpt, it would appear that meteorological disturbance i.e. inversion, was present in this area causing the appearance of a radar return & the disappearance of the IPFF indication from the scope as described in the rpt.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Probably Balloon
Possible Balloon
Was Aircraft
Probably Aircraft
Possibly Aircraft
Was Astronomical Venus & Jupiter
Possibly Astronomical and
Possibly Astronomical Drop
Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Unknown

Evaluation: Attempt to relate anomalous propagation w/astro body.

1. Request your review and analysis of subject UFO report received from the 755th ACW Squadron, Cambria AF Station, California.

2. More credence is generally given to the actual observers of a sighting, in this case, the pilots. While this does not rule out the Commander's opinion, your comments regarding the possibility of IFF and other radar equipment in the vicinity producing spurious indications would be appreciated as part of your conclusions.

h. Any other unusual activity or condition, meteorological, astronomical, etc. None

i. Interception or identification action taken. Love nest 205 and 211 - F2H out of Moffet

j. Location of any air traffic in the area at the time of sighting. None

k. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer, including his analysis. 2nd Lt. USAF (See Remarks)

1. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs. None

m. Remarks: Objects appeared to be stars from casual observance, however points on FPS-6 radar. Hit. In same area indicated objects of same other nature. Fighter aircraft under my control reported visual contact, but no radar contact. They said that the objects appeared to be stars, but I do not agree when fighter aircraft got within 50 miles of the objects, both fighters IFF did not reappear until the fighters were approximately 70 miles from the objects. During this time, there were other IFF points on the IFF in other areas. It was assumed that the IFF equipment of the fighter aircraft was operational.

4. Due to the non-availability of the proper forms, (AF Form 112 and 112A), the reports as listed in par 1 and 2 above are forwarded to your headquarters in the manner.
