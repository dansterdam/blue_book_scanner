The Thing, 10 Feet Tall, Terrifies Party of 7

Sutton, W. Va., Sept. 14 (U.R) - A housewife swore today that she and six boys saw "an evil-smelling fire-breathing monster, 10 feet tall, with a bright green body and blood-red face" on a hillside near here.

Mrs. Kathleen May of Flatwoods, and with her sons, Freddie, Eugene, and the boys, including National Guardsman, made the find Friday night while investigating reports of a strange object.

She said she and Gene Lemon, the guardsman, her sons, Eddie, 13, and Fred, 12, and Neil Nunley, 14, Tommy Hacker, 10, and Tommy Eyre, all 16, all went to the hilltop on the C.B. Fisher farm near here Friday night.

The "thing" was leading the party toward a large oak tree, and when he shone a flashlight on it saw the 10-foot "thing" with the flushed face and green body that "seemed to glow."

Mrs. May said Lemon screamed in terror and fell backward as the monster dickwalked toward them, and the whole party turned and ran. She said the monster seemed to send out a sickening odor, and then they vomited for hours afterward.

SUMMARY: (Under single summary of report. Give significance in first one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures in lower left. Begin list of report on AF Form 118-Part II)

Mrs. [redacted], Shamokin, Pa., reported seeing two unidentified flying objects at approximately 2030, one on 6 September, the other on 8 September 1952.

Mrs. [redacted] told who the objects appeared to be the same or at least very similar, and described them as cigar-shaped with an "orange glow at the base". The object on 6 September was observed for only a few seconds somewhere between 2200 and 2105 at a point East of her position. It was reported to have moved in a straight line toward the South and disappeared.

The second object sighted at 1850S on 8 September was observed for two or three minutes. It also appeared in the east and moved toward the South, but reversed its course after traveling a "fairly short distance" and retraced the same path back. Lehman claimed the speed of the object was "very fast", but her description of the distance it traveled indicates either that his speed was slower than she thought or that the time of the observation was shorter than she believed.

The weather at the time of both observations was clear.

The observations were verified by Mrs. [redacted] and another who originally called attention to both objects.

Mrs. [redacted] inability to give more precise descriptions makes it impossible to determine the exact nature of these objects, but jet aircraft and astronomical phenomena remain strong possibilities.

Dear Sirs:

I am writing to you tell what I saw last Fall about 1st days of September one night when visiting to my friends when returning home. About 10:30 p.m. a flying object or they call a flying discs. This flying object came down within 50 feet on the car on the road, about 25 Feet height of the ground. It haded a light and it stood about 60 seconds in one place and it move away and it turns its light off. This big object was big and round with a nikel plated rim around edges of the object. I should of wrote you this before but I never did get around to do, but as I writing you now, I came to think about it. If the Army wants more explaining about this object, I be willing to do so.

Yours truly,

Dear Mr. Monski:

Thank you for your personal expression of interest in behalf
of Mr. Sylvester Angus, Scranton, concerning "Flying
Saucers."

For the convenience, I am enclosing a report so that
he will have the full picture of our activities in this matter to
date.

As may be noted from this report, the Air Force has received
a number of reports from credible observers which cannot be
explained at this time. However, our investigations of unusual
aerial phenomena have produced nothing which so far we cannot
be explained and understand as some 15 known short occurrences in
the upper atmosphere.

The Air Force appreciates Mr. interest in reporting
his observation. You will want to know that his report has been
filed a matter of record and is being evaluated by the Air Force.
In the event additional information or his answer to inquiry,
an Air Force representative will communicate with Mr. Angus to
obtain the desired information.

Your personal interest is appreciated.

LUMINOUS OBJECT SEEN OVER MALLORCA -- Tangier, Espana, 4 Sep 52

REFER TO CASE: 16 JUL 52, RNGAT, FR. 1102.

On 3 September 1952, late at night, four professors of the Seraphic Seminary in Palma, Mallorca Island, noticed a luminous disk in the sky, traveling from west to east. They said that it could not have been a shooting star and that they were giving the report as objectively as possible in its barest details to provide another item for the study of the flying saucer phenomenon.

TWO METEOROLOGISTS SEE SAUCERS IN UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA -- Oran, L'Echo d'Oran,
8 Sep 52

Refer To CASE-161JLs2-RABAT, PTR. 4072.

On the morning of 6 September 1952, a meteorologist was taking weather
observations in Durban, Union of South Africa, when he saw a white object mov-
ing smoothly across his field of vision. After two more had appeared and
passed in the same manner, he called a coworker, with whom he observed three
more saucers. He was able to follow one of them with a theodolite, which in-
dicated that the object was at a high altitude. It had about the same shape
as a weather balloon which was then at an altitude of only 3,500 meters. The
spherical objects appeared to be at an altitude above 6,500 meters.

Both men have been meteorologists for some time (the second man is the di-
rector of the weather bureau at Natal). Their information was written into the
records of the local meteorological office.
