Enclosure #2

The image shows a black and white photograph of what appears to be a large object covered with a white or light-colored tarp or sheet, situated on a grassy area. In the background, there are some buildings and a street lamp. A few vehicles can be seen parked in the background. The object is draped in a way that obscures its exact shape or nature. The scene looks like it could be at a military or research facility, given the architectural style of the buildings.

Microscope #3

The image shows a large, inflated object on a grassy field. It appears to be a balloon or some kind of inflatable structure with a ribbed or textured surface. The object is white or light-colored and seems quite large, taking up a significant portion of the photograph. In the background, there are trees or vegetation visible. The image is in black and white and looks like it was taken in the 1950s.
