SUMMARY: (State essence of report. Give conclusions in final one or two sentences. Begin text of report on AF Form 112—Part II)

1. At 2001 15 October 1952 and again at 0200, 16 October 1952, unidentified objects were sighted from Ashiya Air Base (130° 34' N - 130° 39' E). Objects presented large similar to light planes traveling at approximately 300 knots, 10 to 70 KM at distances of two (2) miles or less North or West of the runways of Ashiya Air Base. (Objets moved toward the base in a converging pattern). Displacements on the radar scope as they neared the airway. Displacements in the "ground clusters" on the radar scope. No unusual sounds were heard. Visual sightings made by 2A crew or crews of aircraft flying locally in the area of radar sightings. Radar (4) radar crossings, plotting in radar exposure from 10 minutes to 5 years, made radar sightings.

2. Three (3) of the four (4) witnesses agreed that the unidentified objects might be birds.

3. Comments of approving officer: In view of the lack of sound or visual confirmation of presence of the objects, and the opinion of the three (3) of the four (4) witnesses, it is probable that the objects were birds. Weather at the observation was clear and visibility of ten (10) miles. Objects were observed with radar set AN/MPN-1 (GCA) unit #20 on both the two (2) and ten (10) mile precision scopes.

Ref AFI. 200-5, dtd 20 Apr 52, par 7. c. (1): Objects presented target similar to a light aircraft on radar scopes. No definite formations observed although as many as five objects were seen at same time. Ground speed of objects estimated 50 to 70 MPH. Objects had no definite track although general movement was to South and east. No sound was heard. Objects appeared between 200 and 500 feet above surface usually disappearing in ground clutter on radar scopes.

Par 7. c. (2): Time of sighting between 2300 hours October 15, 1952 and 0200 hours 16 October 1952.

Par 7. c. (3): Objects observed with radar set AN/MPN-1 (GCA) unit #20, on both 2 and 10 mile precision (azimuth and elevation) scopes and the search scope.

Par 7. c. (4): GCA unit located at Ashiya AB Base, 33° 51' N 130° 40' E. Objects usually appeared north to west of station from 2 miles or less of field tracking inbound to station and disappearing in ground clutter around the field with altitude ranging from 200 to 500 feet.

Par 7. c. (5): Nothing could be seen visually. The undersigned has had 5 years experience in AN/MPN-1 type radar scope presentation.

Par 7. c. (6): Weather at time of observation: Sky condition - four thousand feet scattered; visibility 10 miles; altimeter setting 29.95. Winds aloft and surface: Surface - 19 knots from 290°; one thousand feet - 10 knots from 290°; two thousand feet - 12 knots from 280°; two thousand five hundred feet - 10 knots from 270°. No other altitude readings available.

Par 7. c. (7): No logical explanation except some type of large bird.

Par 7. c. (8): No physical evidence such as fragments or photographs exist.

Par 7. c. (9): Pilots of aircraft in vicinity reported seeing nothing.

Par 7. c. (10): Take offs and landings at air base were frequent.

Following statement furnished as required by AFI. 200-5, dtd 20 Apr 52

STATEMENT

1. Objects on precision radar scopes present a blip similar to a light aircraft but the density or the return was lighter. Most of the objects were passing from north to south, angling in from 1 to 1 mile from the end of the runway and entering theground clutter on the south side of the runway. The objects showed themselves to be from 200 to 500 feet high on the elevation scopes. In one instance a formation of 5 give crossed the scope at the same time. Ground speed estimated from 50 to 70 MPH. Objects could also be picked up on 7½ mile PPI scope.

2. The undersigned has had 3½ years experience in GCA.

3. Believe objects to be ducks.

S T A T E M E N T

On the evening of the 18th of October 1952, I T/Sgt Raymond E Chace, was on duty in the GOA trailer located at Ashiya AA Base, Japan.

I observed along with the otherteam members definite radar targets on the two mile precision tubes. These targets appeared to be identical with slow moving aircraft. The targets had no definite course or formation, but moved from north to south. At one time five targets appeared. Most of these targets merged into the ground clutter around the end of the runway #12. No sound was heard.

The tower informed us they could not see anything in that area.

These targets also were on the elevation scopes appearing between 200 and 500 feet in the air.

I have been in GOA 21 months. Do not know what these targets were and do not wish to guess.

Following statement furnished as required by AF 200-5, dtd 20 Apr 52

STATEMENT

1. Observed strange objects on precision radar scopes (A1/AFN-1) at altitudes ranging from two to five hundred feet. The targets gave a presentation similar to that of a small aircraft and were travelling at from fifty to seventy miles per hour. These and larger targets were travelling from north to south angling in from about one mile off the end of the runway and entering the ground clutter on the south side of the runway.

2. The undersigned has had ten months experience observing presentation of A1/AFN-1 type radar scopes.

3. Believe objects to be birds.
