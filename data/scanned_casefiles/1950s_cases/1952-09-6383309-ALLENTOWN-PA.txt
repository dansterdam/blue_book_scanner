Civilian pilot, an inactive AF reserve certain point on a flying or mapped football shaped object traveling on collision course with his light a/c. Object pulled up and over windshield moving in opposite direction from course of plane. Object was traveling at 700 mph.

11. COMMENTS:
1. The brevity of observation and the description give the impression of a balloon. However, the object's change of direction toward is inconsistent with this theory.

SUMMARY. (Give only the essential facts. Use numbered paragraph. List incidents in lower left. Date last of report on AF Form 112a-Part II)

1.    Capt Air Force Reserve (Inactive), presently employed by [redacted], New York, NY, was submitted a letter to Commanding General, Headquarters First Air Force, Mitchell Air Force Base, New York, dated 23 September 1952, which is verbatim as follows:

"Dear Sir:
If I had not seen the enclosed clipping, I probably would not have made the following report, however, since other people in the vicinity were I, insanely, saw the same unusual phenomena saw the same thing, I thought perhaps I should describe my experience.

On 13 September 1952 at about 1940 PM I was flying alone at 10,000 feet from Allentown, Pennsylvania, to the Caldwell-Wright Station in a Cessna Visability was good. Ceiling about 12,000 feet. There were no clouds of any kind although there was some haze...from the ground to more than 12,000 feet.

I was approximately 15 to 20 miles NE of Allentown when suddenly a bright object which appeared to be shaped like a fast moving small red disc in clarity, flashing orange-red in color, appeared at a distance of 150 to 200 yards ahead of me at about eleven o'clock high. It was descending at about a 30 and possibly 45 degree angle. The impression was that I was on a collision course with it. I immediately pulled up into a steep climb to avoid hitting it. The object, instead of continuing at a 45 degree angle, very quickly pulled up into about a 65 degree climb and went directly over my windshield. I quickly made a 180 to the right and began to look as long as I could. If the object was at the distance and was of the size that it appeared to be so as to be large, I would estimate it was roughly 100 miles an hour. What I saw was actually a physical object, the rapidity with which it altered its course was astonishing.

Since I was able to see it for not more than two seconds, I hesitated to report what I saw. After the object went by, I resumed my course and for the next 20 minutes tried..."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

to be sure that what I had seen had not been a light reflection
on the windshield. I felt reasonably sure it was not.
"I report now that I did not make this report immediately but
the experience was so brief that I hesitated to report it until
I saw the enclosed newspaper report."

2. The newspaper report referred to by [redacted], was obtained from the newspaper,
Newark Evening News, Newark, New Jersey, dated 15 September 1952, titled "Flying
Saucer" Seen in Hackettstown with a 15 set forward verbatim below:
    - A flaming object, larger than an airplane, was
reported hovering over this community last night by six
persons, each of whom turned in a flying saucer.
"One of those who saw it, an artist, will put her impression
of the object on canvas."
[Redacted] and Mrs. [Redacted] Avenue described the
object as a "flaming red ball with a tail". The tail's
density changed, they said. The object hung motionless
at an estimated altitude of 4,000 feet for 20 minutes before
moving slowly westward in the direction of Hackettstown,
they declared.

3. The original copy of [redacted] letter remains on file at the
District Office.
