On March 22, 1958, I stood on my front porch looking for something on our little front sky telescope camera. I was looking out since I was able to be bright enough to see what was going on the former of you on my telescope cam on a 6 inch telescope. I noticed a faint spark of light, would have seen have started at first but have been lost at Sirius, pass under the inter Sirius on a south westerly heading. At first I thought it might be an artificial meteor - I hope maybe the 20 year old built it even, I shall look that it would be traveling in the opposite direction. I know it wasn't a meteor flying by quickly and leave a momentary streak of light, but this faint light did move either. Passing the time same I - about eight (8) seconds - I tried to estimate its distance and traveled. I should guess that it passed through an angle of about 20° to 25°. I see

In finally guessing that the sky at that time had a horizon of about 50°. During the time I saw the light I stood, no sound to be seen as I could see from any sky plane and if I could. Then would be a small during the time of some minutes I expect I try to detect the light of each body. It could become a ground at my watch to catch it but the sun will be

Here is the text from the document:

Being the time I was out for the 9 yard of our corps when some few things they what looked a small colored object to have flying a very high altitude - it made me wonder what to. I was well past my CP and saw a white site. All of just identify of the object was the height at my left top of what was round to be a clear sky. The ground below some 500 feet, define more clear of a satellite, but was dark if I think it was coming on satellite. If you will tell what it was please hotify me because my curiosity would be.

Sincerely yours,

The image contains a hand-drawn diagram with various annotations and directional arrows, including labels like "Mars", "Viewers Point", and some other partially legible notes. The diagram appears to be a sketch showing relative positions or movements of something, possibly related to an observed object or event.

UFO Sighting

SAFOI-3, ATTN: Maj. Tucker                                   25 March 1959
AFOSR-NY                                                           1

1. The possibility of Mr. [redacted] observing a satellite was considered. However, the speed of the object was too great and duration too short for a satellite.

2. The duration of the sighting was too great to have been a meteor. The average life of a meteor is 1 second or less.

3. The speed, assuming the witness made a good estimate, is quite high for any aircraft other than an F-104 or F-94. It is known that F-104's operate in this area, and could have been running an Intersept mission. The F-104's have four lights on the tail arranged in a perimeter and thus can be seen from almost any angle.

4. It is the opinion of this office that the object was probably a high flying jet aircraft, with distance and wind accounting for the absence of sound.

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge your letter received at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on 6 March concerning an unidentified flying object sighting in Bloomington, Illinois, on 2 March.

The findings of the Air Technical Intelligence Center reveal the following:

1. The speed of the object was too great and the duration of time observed too short for it to be a satellite.

2. The duration of the sighting was too great to have been a meteor. The average life of a meteor is 1/2 second or less.

3. The speed as estimated is quite high for any aircraft other than F-104 or B-58 jets. It is known that F-104s operate in the Bloomington area and this aircraft has known flight characteristics on the tall structure arranged in a perimeter so they can be seen from almost any angle.

4. It is the opinion of the Air Technical Intelligence Center that you observed a high-flying jet aircraft with distance and wind accounting for the absence of sound.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
