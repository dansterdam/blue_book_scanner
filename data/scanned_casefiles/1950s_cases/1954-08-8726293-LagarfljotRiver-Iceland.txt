SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

1. On 4 September 1954, information was received by this command to the effect that an incident occurred near Egilsstadir, Iceland, at approximately 2200 hours 28 August 1954 in the vicinity of Lagarfljot River by an individual.

2. The eyewitness, who was located approximately 3000 feet from the location of flight of the object, generally described it as being approximately 15 feet in length (2 to 24 feet long), approximately 4 to 5 inches in diameter, cylindrical in shape and having a grayish-white color, with a whitish smoke reportedly crossing the sky from the southeast.

3. A lower wing 150 feet away from the parking lot of the Lagarfljot River and from the area where the object was observed, a detector is constructed so as to be effective for the depth of from 15 to 22 inches. Much of the area was underwater at the time of the observation, and the local people, continually engaged with the power plant, could not be reached.

4. Investigation of the formation of the phenomena and some early reports indicated the report to be polite and are of good reputation in the community.

5. Among the possible identifications of the reported object are a bird, a meteor or the tip-tank of an aircraft. There were no Defense Force aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the observation.

[TOP SECRET]

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

PREPARING OFFICE: 4600th CIR Detach, APO 81, c/o Postmaster, N.Y.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

CONCLUSIONS: It is the opinion of this command that most of the witnesses did not see the flying object as the constant downstream motion of the river water and the constant downstream motion of the impact area, shifting laws and other possible factors prevented these witnesses from being able to locate the object, but this opinion is after investigation. On the other hand, the witnesses were quite positive about their observations.

1 (FOB Beach) Sector Record
1 Photograph of impact area
1 Photograph taken of impact area from town over which object passed
