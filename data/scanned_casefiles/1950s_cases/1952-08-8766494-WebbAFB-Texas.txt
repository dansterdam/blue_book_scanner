NARRATIVE STATEMENT OF OBSERVATION

22 August 1952
On 17 August 1952, at approximately 1200 hours, Capt. Henry J. Hill, Serial No. 0812359, of the 3700th Pilot Training Squadron, Webb AFB, Texas, reported to Webb AFB that he had observed an unidentified object in the sky near the base. 
The object was heading northwest and was at an estimated elevation of 15,000 feet above MSL. The object was visible for approximately 40 seconds and was disc shaped with a diameter of approximately 50-60 feet. The object was traveling at a terrific rate of speed, estimated at over 500 knots. It continued to climb at a constant rate and disappeared from sight after traveling approximately 20 miles. The weather was clear with excellent visibility and no clouds or other phenomena which could have accounted for the object.
The observer stated that the object was under intelligent control and its maneuvers indicated characteristics not known in present-day aircraft. The object covered the distance of approximately 20 miles in approximately 30 seconds, or at an estimated speed of over 2,000 feet per second.
