other aircraft were used.

(4) Location of Observer: During sighting. The observer was flying at a speed of
about 150 knots at an altitude of 8000 feet. The object was sighted
on a true bearing of 245° at an altitude of 8000 feet. The observer's heading
was 045° and the object was on the observer's right. It was traveling at a speed estimated well over 500 MPH at an
altitude of 10000 feet. The observer was flying an approximately 275° true heading
sighted the object at two o'clock.

(5) The observer is thirty two years of age and has an estimated 6000 hours
of flying time. He is a military pilot who has been flying since 1935 and was graduated from Military Pilot Training in

NARRATIVE STATEMENT OF OBSERVER

22 August 1952

1. On 17 August 1952, while on a routine training flight from Hensley Naval Air Station, Dallas, Texas to Webb Air Force Base, Big Spring, Texas, I saw an unusual object approximately one and one-half miles 150° off my heading to the right. The time of sighting was 1649 hours. I was flying an Air Force T-6D at an altitude of 6000 feet above MSL with an indicated air speed of 150 knots on a true heading of 245°. The weather was clear with visibility unlimited. The wind was 160°, 12 knots. My position at time of sighting was 36° 39' N, 99° 18' W.

2. The object was at an altitude of approximately 15000 feet above MSL on a heading of 275° and traveling at a very flat speed of over 500 MPH. The object was just below cloud base when first sighted and was climbing. It continued to climb through scuddy clouds and disappeared from sight in about three seconds, still climbing at approximately 2000 feet per minute at the worst.

3. I was flying to the right of the Civil Airway in the twilight zone. Two Navy jet aircraft had passed at about 1140 hours, CST. I had met a C-54, William Lockheed Hudson and a B-25 going east over Weatherford, Texas, 320.5°W, 970.48'W.

4. When I first noticed the object it attracted my attention about two o'clock. Its movement was in a straight line with no smoke trail or streamer in its wake. No excessive static was noticed in the radio receiver. It was very attractive and seemed to move with ease traveling at a constant rate of speed. There were no wings or rudder visible.

5. The object appeared oblong in shape and of a size slightly smaller than the Air Force B-29. Exact size and shape of the object would be hard to describe definitely due to only 3 or 4 seconds of observation and the apparent distance. The object covered approximately thirty miles in the three seconds observed.
