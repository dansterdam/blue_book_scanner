REPORT STRANGE OBJECT OVER TANGIER AND FES -- Fes, Le Courrier du Maroc, 22 Sep 52.

REFER TO ( )13152-FR. MOREL ( )RABAT

On 21 September 1952, at 1845 hours, many people at a beach 11 kilometers from Tangier saw toward the south a luminous disk of a diameter close to that of the setting sun, flying horizontally from east to west. After holding its course for about 12 seconds, the disk, which looked like a brightly illuminated metal object, suddenly emitted two great streaks of flames and disappeared.

At 1820 hours, a strange object was also seen in the sky over Fes, French Morocco, flying at high speed from east to west and leaving behind a luminous white trail.

BELIEVE OBJECT OVER MOROCCO ONLY A METEOR -- Rabat, L'Echo du Maroc, 22 Sep 52

REFER TO: CASE: 70   CASE #: 52-1407   AREA: RABAT-CASABLANCA

On 21 September 1952, at 1818 hours, the mysterious flying object seen in all Morocco and beyond was observed over Rabat. It seems more likely, however, that this time, it was a meteor, because the trajectory of the object was given as rectilinear, it did not maneuver in the way seen to do, and its entire body was incandescent, which is not true of flying machines.

The object was variously described as an orange-colored ball of fire, an arrow, or a cone-shaped object trailing a bright green-blue cloud of smoke, heading from east to west, and parallel to the coast, and moving at speed of a conventional plane at an altitude of about 1,000 meters. The object was visible for only a few seconds. After it passed a thin, white trail of smoke remained visible for about 5 minutes.

PILOT GETS CLOSE VIEW OF SAUCER FOR BRIEF INTERVAL -- Casablanca, Maroc-Presse, 23 Sep 52

The pilot of a tourist plane reports that on 21 September 1952, he flew for 10 seconds and about 50 meters in the same direction as the flying saucer, so widely observed that day. This former military pilot, whose name in Crese, answered specific questions put to him and gave the following information:

As he was preparing to land at an airfield in Casablanca, at 1825 hours, he noticed the strange object about 30 meters to the left of his plane (a ground mechanic later verified this, as he saw a luminous object fly between himself and the plane). It was flying horizontally from east to west, along the same line of flight as that maintained by Crese. The latter was doing 220 kilometers an hour at the time, at an altitude of 450 meters, and the object was going about twice as fast. He motioned to his passengers, who saw it too.

It looked like a bright blue-green flame and had an oblong cigar-like shape. He heard no noise coming from it. After it passed the plane, it disappeared in the direction of the sea. The pilot did not attempt to pursue it, fearing the same fate as that of the US pilot [Captain Mantell].

That same evening, in Assmour, French Morocco, a French couple and their farm workers heard a loud explosion as the strange flying object passed by. This is the first report we have of any sound heard from such objects. Other reports were received from Fez, Meknes, and Safi, where in each case the sighting was said to have occurred at 1820 hours.

THOUSANDS WITNESS SAUCER OVER MOROCCO AND TANGIER -- Casablanca, Moroc-Press,
22 Sep 52

REFER: CASE: 16Juls-RABAT, FR. MC

On 21 September 1952, at about 1820 hours, an unusual object, possibly a
saucer, flew at great speed over Casablanca. Shortly afterwards, about 15 telephone calls were received from local residents, and our Tangier correspondent

called to say that he had seen the object going from east to west at 1815 hours
(about 2-5 minutes before it flew over Casablanca). Also, two observers in
the Medrik River valley were able to time the passage of the object with a
chronometer; it was then 1817 hours, and the object was coming from the direction of Rabat, traveling from east to west.

Some of the reports gave the following details about the object: luminous,
cigar-shaped, and giving off a silvery smoke trail; a luminous, whitish-green
globe ending in a long cone and flying about 700 feet up, the same as a plane
which flew by at the same time (outside of Casablanca); and a flaming, globeshaped mass trailing white smoke in puffs, as though puff followed an explosion -- the object stopped short a moment and revolved on itself, emitting a
shower of sparks about its zone.

About 6,000 spectators at a boxing match in Casablanca saw the object
pass over the arena. In Louis Gentil, numerous persons saw it at 1818 hours,
flying from east to west. In Marrakech, it made its appearance for 5 seconds
at 1839 hours, when it was clearly seen by three persons who described it as
a meteor, again traveling from east to west.

Casablanca, 24 September 1952
Dr. Lytle

Dear Sir:

In your letter addressed to the private astronomical observatory of my brother, 
you raised a question as to whether, with the care of Mr. Chauchard's, I have 
observed any "flying saucer". I have the liberty to answer your question as follows:

My brother died a few years ago and his astronomical observatory ceased to exist. 
I myself continued his work in a very small scale at the central astronomical 
observatory. However, these observations are, as we can't be satisfied and fully 
reliable. I have never observed phenomena similar to the above-mentioned cases, however, 
as mentioned before, my observations are not fully reliable.

It is correct that almost all reports on "flying saucers" come from the USA. 
However, some days ago, I found the enclosed newspaper article according to which a 
"flying saucer" has been observed by many people on the coast of Morocco near Casa-
blanca. I do not know who read this article and, therefore, I enclose it for 
your information.

Very truly yours,
/s/

Inclosure: "On Sunday evening, thousands of people observed a "flying saucer" 
enticing a no-callio (sic) light which was visible at 11 minutes-speed across 
the skies over Casablanca. It was visible for about six seconds. Eight 
minutes later, it was observed over Boulhaut which is 50 kilometers away 
from Casablanca."

LETTER GIVING OBSERVATIONS OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS

Letter from Swabisch Astronomical Observatory, Hag. Stuttgart
Linden, Ludwigstrasse 51 - Postal Checking Account, Stuttgart No. 221 07
                                (16a) Stuttgart 4, 12 September 1952

Dear Sir:

In reply to your inquiry we inform you that heretofore we have not observed any "flying saucers" in this region. However, besides this positive information, we are able to relate some experiences which may shed some light on such observation reports.

Only last survey, I received an excited telephone call in the middle of the night reporting an unfamiliar object rising on the eastern sky with increasing brightness and a remarkable change in color from red to white at a slowly visible altitude not very high above the horizon. Landmarks on the horizon so that it could be traced unmistakably. By an immediate check, I identified the mysterious thing as the rising planet Jupiter. Its brightness as of such intensity at its low altitude over the horizon and another star of similar brightness, mistake it for something extraordinary. After its rise above the horizon, it first appears in a light-absorbing haze which makes it appear reddish and of low brightness, then later as a bright, clearly visible point of light relative to the horizon is clearly observable; however, the speed of this motion is overestimated particularly by the lay-man who believes that the celestial bodies are standing still or moving as slowly as all.

Another time, a great noise suddenly arose in front of the astronomical observatory. A flying saucer! To immediately locate its and say a 1/4 degree long luminous body flying along the southern horizon. It could immediately be identified through a former AA telescope! It was a glider in tow, the wings of which bore the words "Trumpf" - Paletot" in luminous letters.

The third time, it was an airliner flying at a relatively high altitude whose searchlight, "reading" from the haze lingering over town, produced a spot somewhat weakened in color with a dirty red rim. Thus, we were able to clarify all reports given to us in a very sober manner and, based on these experiences, we are called to color largely similar explanations for a large number of all reports on flying saucers.

Hoping that this information will be of some use to you, we remain,

[Signature and additional details are redacted/blacked out]
