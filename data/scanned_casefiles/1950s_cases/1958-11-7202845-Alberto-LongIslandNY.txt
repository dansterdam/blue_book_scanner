[A large portion of the text in the middle of the document is obscured by a black redaction/censorship bar]

SPACES 2 NOV ADDED

[A signature or initials at the bottom that appears to read "Ato"]

At the top right corner, there are two handwritten numbers: 27454 and 3-412202.

Some text is partially visible but not fully legible due to the black redaction bar covering a significant portion of the document.


- page 8 -

The only legible text on this page is at the bottom center of the document, which reads:

EOUO F 70289342567 CG 124

The rest of the page appears to be very faint or washed out, with only scattered dots and very light text that is not clearly readable.
