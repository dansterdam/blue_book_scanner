10. 25 June 1952, Japan/Korea area.
This is not a single report but a collection of 13 radar reports which occurred in 1951 and 1952. No adequate explanation has been given by the radar expert for any of them and therefore I pass as far as any judgment as to their cause. This is strictly for the radar experts.

11. 22 July 1952, Maxwell, Texas.
Evaluation as possible meteor is not tenable if object was seen to climb from 8,000 feet to 14,000 feet, then to hover, two to drop at an angle of 45 degrees, continue hovering, and fly south at 5,000 feet. It was reported by four air police and a staff sergeant. This is clearly a case which should have been followed up further. Proper classification: insufficient follow-up, or insufficient formation.

12. 22 July 1952, Uvalde, Texas.
This is an interesting case, with two witnesses. Chief witness was the weather observer of Trans-Texas Airlines who was thoroughly familiar with planes, weather balloons, etc. Object covered an arc of approximately 100 degrees in 45 seconds, had no visible aerodynamic features, had a bright afterglow, and a gyrating movement. No sound. Object seemed to climb higher every second and move from in front of a cumulus cloud to in back of it, thus giving some estimate of distance. Object observed in broad daylight. It is too bad that this one was not much more thoroughly investigated since there were two adult witnesses and one 14-year old witness. It must be carried as unknown. I have rated it as D4 G7.

13. 24 July 1952, Carson Sink, Nevada.
Sighting just three to four seconds in duration, too short a time to make any definite observations. Witnesses were two lieutenant colonels flying a B25 at 11,000 feet. In view of the fact that there were two qualified witnesses, case must be carried as unidentified (limited data).

14. 28 December 1953, Marysville, California.
A one-witness case. Even though observed by a fairly qualified witness it is very strange that there were no other witnesses since

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                   9 July 1963

Subj:  UFO Observation of 22 July 1952

I agree with Dr Hynek that the flight characteristics and duration as given certainly don't agree with those of a meteor. Possibly the evaluator had information that has since been lost. There is insufficient information now available for an analysis. To change the evaluation at this time, however, would cause an unwarranted amount of work in changing our records.
