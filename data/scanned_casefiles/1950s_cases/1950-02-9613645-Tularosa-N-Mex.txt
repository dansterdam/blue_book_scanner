attracted their attention to the object was its brilliance and extremely large size. This object did not change shape, leave a trail, or change or color.
* Weather conditions at that time were an overcast in the near vicinity. Reports indicated the object was visible until finally covered the object. There was no radar in operation at the time of the sighting. Checks were made with the nearest Signal Station, White Sands Proving Ground, and Biggs Air Force Base, and it was determined that no testing devices had been used that night. The reports indicated the atmosphere was calm, no wind, no rain, and visibility at the time was good. Projects Mogul, Skyhook, and the electronics & atmosphere Branch, Holloman AFB, were consulted, but there were no local flights at that time.
