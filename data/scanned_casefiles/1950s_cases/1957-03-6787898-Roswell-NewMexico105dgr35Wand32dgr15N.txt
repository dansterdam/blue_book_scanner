Ev. Card Opmeant

Cannot say definitely whether the object seen was distant aircraft flying at high altitude or whether it was a celestial body. The ground observer said he was unable to accurately estimate the size or altitude of the object due to its apparent small size and lack of familiar reference points in the night sky. However, based on the reported brightness and flight characteristics, a celestial body appears to be the most likely explanation.
