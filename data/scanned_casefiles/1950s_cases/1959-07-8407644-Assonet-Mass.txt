SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for June 20, 1959

ENGINEERING
Largest Ball Bearing Measures 14 Feet

THE LARGEST precision ball bearing ever made weighs 13,000 pounds, measures 14 feet in diameter, and will support the largest turntables, gear boxes and other machinery.

It is a 5-row, 26-inch ball bearing designed for turbine generator foundations and will resist the tremendous loads involved.  This first of its kind bearing was built by the Kaydon Engineering Corporation, Grand Rapids, Mich.  Some of its different features make up the largest ball bearing ever built, the International Nickel Company, Inc., in New York, says.

The ball bearing was forged from chromium-molybdenum alloy steel, which has good hardness, toughness and impact resistance even at low temperatures.  The race and bearing sections were forged separately and then assembled.

The race diameter of 14 feet and a width of 14 inches are unusually large dimensions. Already a larger bearing is being designed - one with a 16-foot diameter.

Larger ball bearings will be needed.  As power-generating equipment grows in size, even larger bearings will be required.  Already a few 12-foot bearings are being designed.  Bearings for machines of 100 feet are probable in the future.

GENETICS
Computers Improve Study of Gene Mutation

COMPUTERS CAN HELP in the difficult study of gene changes, called mutations, which can result in inherited human defects. 

Computers have enabled scientists to make new discoveries about the effects of gene changes following exposure to radiation and certain chemicals.

We have reached a point now, where computers can help us detect subtle effects of gene mutations which hitherto could not be observed, says Dr. James V. Neel of the University of Michigan, and Dr. William L. Russell of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Newcomb of Atomic Energy Canada, Ltd.

Their studies show that low-level radiation may cause mutations in a population. By tracing the mutation rate, they are investigating the relationship of radiation, drugs, and chemicals to the inheritance of various types of genes. In this second way, the gene mutation method could also be invaluable for investigating damage from air pollution, from cancer-producing chemicals, and from other changes in our environment.

Our ignorance of the point represents a major obstacle in estimating the probable mutation rate, Dr. Newcomb told scientists at a symposium on hereditary diseases in Syracuse, N.Y.

Computers, by speeding up the tedious data processing, have helped scientists study subtle gene mutations and their causes more effectively.

PHYSIOLOGY
New Cortisone-Like Drug Cases Sunburn Discomforts

A NEW CORTISONE-LIKE drug has been found to be effective in relieving sun-produced skin irritation and inflammation, known as sunburn, in many persons who have had reactions to prolonged sun exposure.

The drug, called betamethasone, the Journal of the American Medical Association reports, was found to be effective in relieving the discomfort to many persons who have had sunburn reactions.

The doctors reported that the drug caused no side effects, such as those sometimes produced by cortisone. It should be used, however, only under a physician's supervision, since the drug does have some effect similar to cortisone.

SEA CUCUMBER May Be New Canned Food

A SEA CUCUMBER chowder may soon be coming to the nation's high-class restaurants and dinner tables. The sea cucumber looks like a cucumber, but has the texture of clams and the taste of scallops or shrimp. It lives on the sea floor, looks like a cucumber, and tastes quite delicious, scientists say.

In the search for new sources of protein-rich, low-cost foods, the U. S. Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service is exploring the possibilities of the sea cucumber as a commercial food product. They have found that the sea cucumber is a good source of protein, low in fat, and high in minerals. Work is now being done to determine best methods of processing, canning and marketing the sea cucumber.

After it is cleaned and eviscerated - by pulling off one or the other ends, spilling the insides - the sea cucumber may be canned, frozen, or dried and used as is to prepare gourmet seafood dishes.

Text from the document:

other planets or a star--because it takes up so much space in the sky. There is a lump of dark space between the stars for the planets to move, and not come in front of.
The most unusual event on the celestial program for july is such a planetary occultation. This occurs on the seventh, when Venus occults Regulus, in Leo. This star is at the end of the handle (which is toward the east) of a smaller group, the Sickle, in Leo. It will be a close grazing occultation, visible from the Eastern Standard Time, when Venus is low in the east. Further events, of course, will not have risen.
while Venus is so bright that you can see it in the daytime, if you, know just where to look, you cannot see the star. The phenomenon will be visible in Europe and parts of Asia. It will be darker when it happens.
that even though the actual occultation, it will be interesting to watch Venus before and after the seventh, especially in relation to Regulus. On the evenings of the sixth and sixth, the planet will draw closer and closer to the star; and on the seventh it will have passed it.

The text in the report is as follows:

INDIANA FAMILY CHASES SAUCERS:
On the night of July 9th, a family living in the rural area near Columbus, Indiana, said that they witnessed a group of several white lights in the sky near their home. They told officials that the lights seemed to play around and disappear from sight before reappearing and then repeating this activity several times. The family tried to chase the lights by car but could not keep up with them. They said the lights seemed to be traveling at tremendous speeds. The father of the family said he thought he could have thrown a rock and hit them, they were so low. These lights remained in the sky for about an hour, then they flew of out sight. Local officials identified the lights as being similar to Air Force night training flights, but this explanation does not fit the facts as told by the family.

The image does not contain a photograph, only handwritten text. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text output found in the document:

The left hand went out, and I photo looked, but the U.F.O had left. It hovered a few moments, then went out swinging up the road as my friends were watching. I told them about it, but they did not believe my story, so I did not argue the case with the officials us there.

The CBS television program about U.F.O.s made me realise that the program was too negative in its approach, and I decided to finally report my observation directly to the ATIC of Wright-Patterson AFB.

On #20 the object hanged motionless at all - lasted by object 5-6's approximately 10 minutes of viewing time. The object dissed to me 2 miles high.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with handwritten text.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 
JUNE  28, 1959

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Yes I could not complete your questionnaire because the UFO sighting lasted only a few seconds. The UFO was startling on the hil1s1de above us. It was a fast moving object with a long tail, like a shooting star in slow motion. White or bright red and seemed to hesitate and then move off rapidly. It moved toward the west and then at an angle, and finally disappeared. It was moving so fast that I could not get a camera in time to photograph it. What has been printed about color change and hovering is not correct. This moving aerial object was observed by several others who were with me at the time.

I drew a hasty sketch of the object just as I saw it. The sketch shows the relative path of the object to the hills and its apparent motion. The color change and hovering which I have read about in other UFO reports was not characteristic of this one. It just appeared, moved rapidly and disappeared. There was no sound and no trail except a faint one. This whole thing was over in a few seconds and it was necessary to act quickly, so I did not get a photograph or detailed drawing. I regret this but the object was gone so fast I could not react in time. I am sure this UFO was something not explainable from any natural or manmade source.

ASTRONOMY

Heavenly Display Very Good

Venus is at its greatest brilliancy June 26. With Jupiter and Saturn, plus a full moon, mid-July nights will yield unusually interesting viewing.

BY JAMES STOKEY

WITH THE WARM weather of summer, many persons are finally able to get out of doors and take a look at the heavens. This is an excellent opportunity to see the stars that shine over-head. They are the object of much astronomical interest, and the accompanying map shows their positions on the night of July 15 at standard time (or eleven by daylight saving time) at the first of the month.

The brightest of these planets is Venus, which appears in the west shortly after sunset. It has become very bright, and by mid-July it will be rivaling the evening star at the beginning of the year. 

It has been getting brighter and will do so until sometime in August, when it begins to decline. At its present magnitude, about 4.3-miles in diameter, it is a very conspicuous object in the evening sky.

Next in the order of brightness are Jupiter and Saturn. Both of these great planets now shine in the evening sky, and that is why it is so low on the stage. By July 15 Jupiter will be setting about 11:40 p.m. while Saturn will rise about 8:15 p.m. These planets do not appear on our map. In fact, on July 7 Saturn comes into opposition in Taurus, while Jupiter is now slowly retrograding, or moving westward in the sky. This is unusual, as most planets appear to move from west to east against the background of stars.

The third planet is Saturn, of magnitude 0.6, equal to a bright star of the first magnitude. This is sometimes mistaken for a star, since some of the stars of this group form a more or less clearly defined line which gives the impression of a constellation. Some of the stars of this group from the outline of a square, with the handle to the left.

Two Other Planets Visible

There are two other planets that can sometimes be seen with the naked eye, and these are Mars and Mercury. Mars is also in Leo. It is high in the sky and can be seen by observers from mid-evening to dawn. At this time it is a full magnitude fainter than Venus and further north, but still a rather conspicuous object. It is low on the horizon, however, and appears like a second magnitude star. In addition, its position changes rapidly so that on July 15 it will be higher and a little to the right of its position here shown. Mercury, third planet in order of brightness, makes one of its infrequent appearances in the evening sky. On July 15 it will be about four and a half degrees above the horizon, just before the sun sets. Like Venus, it will be at its greatest brilliancy on June 26, so it is worth while looking for it during that part of the month.
