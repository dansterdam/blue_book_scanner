SUBJECT: Report of Unconventional Airborne Objects

To: Commanding General

1. In compliance with ADCR 200-5 dated 11 April 1952, the following report is respectfully submitted.

2. The following information is not the result of an investigation of the undersigned, merely evidence from citizens of Fargo, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota.

3. On or about 2115 hours 27 April 1952, a call from the Fargo Police Department was received concerning airborne objects that glowed very bright directly over the city of Fargo and Minnesota between 2100 and 2145 hours. The glowing objects were described as a "gliding ball" or "gliding ball" formation consisting of five (5) disks per flight in five (5) flights approximately eight (8) minutes apart. Direction of flight was constantly south to north. The objects appeared to be very bright, very fast. Size could not be determined since disks were traveling very high. No trails of vapor or exhaust were seen. No obvious means of propulsion was apparent. Formation was described as "disk 'W' like irregular, or more specifically, rather silvery, in that the disk pilots, if such is the case, appeared to have trouble maintaining constant speed or altitude.

4. Time of observation between 2100 and 2145 hours. Total sighting time for all disks about four (4) seconds, after which time disks suddenly disappeared.

5. Number of observation was visual and no binoculars or other optical assistants were employed. Speed, altitude and type of aircraft were unknown. No surface of disk unknown. Only description available was a "gliding ball". No electronic equipment was available for use.

6. Location of observer was on Southeast corner of Third Avenue South and Sixth Street South in Fargo, North Dakota. Objects were sighted directly overhead moving north. Altitude unknown.

[Several names are blacked out]

f. Weather was excellent, no ceiling or clouds, wind from
the south, force (4) miles per hour.

g. There were no activities, meteorological or otherwise,
which might have accounted for the flight.

h. No photographs were taken of the sighting. There were
no fragments or physical evidence of the objects.

i. No information was made or attempted, nor was identif-
ication by the proper authorities possible.

j. There was no local aircraft activity at the time of the
sighting. Inbound Airlines flight from Minneapolis to Fargo passed
through the area and was cited by the majority of the parties that
are concerned in this case, over Fargo ND about 1/2 hour before
approach time for that commercial flight.

3. This report, classified confidential, was prepared at 0900
hours, 27 April 1952 and will go forward via airmail to the proj-
ect headquarters. This headquarters awaited arrival of ATIC

a. The Airborne Objects referred to as disks by several citizens of Moorhead, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota, were reportedly flying very fast, bright red and orange, etc., on or about 25 April 1952, have travel out to be ballard and well broke.

b. To satisfy his own curiosity, the undersigned proceeded to the top (10th floor) floor of the Tank Building in the city of Fargo, North Dakota, about 1900 hours on 28 April 1952, equipped with binoculars, high speed camera, telescope, etc., and scanned the mysterious flights.

c. On or about 2115 hours several tall disks passed over, high, fast, and bright orange. Identification was positive via flapping wings. These followed, also illuminated and were positively identified by "looking". Photographic was taken by the 2.4 A.C. lens in the light in the sky thus causing the strange illumination.

d. Observation heretofore had been from the ground level with lighting glare. The difference in both of these factors caused the objects to show up more clearly.

APPENDIX I

Fargo, North Dakota - 25 April 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
Between 2100 and 2145 hours on 25 April 1952, eight observers reported sighting unidentified flying discs which appeared in a wide "W" formation. There were five discs per flight and a total of five flights at eight minute intervals. The direction of flight was consistently south to north.

The formation was described as a wide "W", irregular or more specifically, sloppy, in that the disc pilots, if such is the case, appeared to have trouble maintaining constant speed and altitude.

II. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION
The Commanding Officer of Detachment 2, 462nd Ground Observer Squadron, Fargo Filter Center, Fargo, North Dakota, followed up the report personally. He proceeded to the top (10th floor) of the Black Building in Fargo, North Dakota, at about 2030 hours on 28 April 1952 equipped with binoculars, high-speed camera, telescope, etc., and awaited the mysterious flights. A number of local citizens shared his vigil with him.

III. CONCLUSIONS
The unidentified discs seen traveling very high and fast and of bright red and orange color were identified by the above observers (II) as being migrating mallard and teal ducks.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS.
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

1.   In compliance with ADCL 200-1 dated 11 April 1951, the
following report is respectfully submitted.

2.   The following information is not the result of an obser-
vation of the undersigned, simply hearsay evidence from citizens of
Moorhead, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota.

a.   On or about 2145 hours 25 April 1952, a call from the
Fargo Police Department was received by this writer. The reasons
for the call were that certain objects that were seen "Very High" directly over the
City of Moorhead Minnesota between 2100 and 2145 hours. The glowing
objects hereinafter referred to as "Disks" appeared in wide W'ly for-
mation consisting of five (5) disks per flight in five (5) flights
approximately eight (8) minutes apart. Direction of flight was oc-
casionally South to North. No shape, other than "round" was apparent.
Size could not be determined since disks were traveling very high.
No trails of vapor or exhaust were seen. No obvious means of pro-
pulsion were apparent nor was there any noise made by any disk.
Formation was described as wide W'ly but increasingly, or more specif-
ically, rather sloppy, in that the disks pilots, if such is the case,
appeared to have trouble maintaining constant speed and altitude.

b.   Time of observation between 2100 and 2145 hours.
Actual sighting time per flight of disks: about four (4) seconds,
after which time disks suddenly disappeared.

c.   Manner of observation was visual and no binoculars
or other optical assistants were employed. Speed, altitude and type
of aircraft was unknown. Form surface of disk unknown. Only descrip-
tion pertinent to same was "a glowing ball." No electronic equip-
ment was available for use.

d.   Location of observer was on Southwest corner of
Third Avenue South and Sixth Street South in Moorhead, Minnesota.
Objects were sited directly overhead moving north. Altitude unknown.
