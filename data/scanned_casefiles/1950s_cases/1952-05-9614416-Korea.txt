AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det. 1, 600th AIS, APO 950                     E-102                     PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

conservative, reliable, and are accepted as an authentic report to team. This object
was first sighted visually and reported to be round at station to the F-94.

weather and wind conditions at the time of sighting: Visibility unlimited with
dawn light to dark - wind was from the west at approx. 10-15 knots. Ceiling
of 21,000 was no weather activity noted. It would rather indicate the attempt to visually
sight the object was under a strain. The crew, both F-94 and ground, in the
only activity or conditions noted to lead would be it account for the difficulty.

Comments: The light from F-94 was noted to be for size of a household socket
visible and the F-94 was flying at or near during part of the encounter. The crew
believed but cannot medically or not explain contact or this phenomenon. Its
silhouette and further glow of the F-94.

D/I FEAF Comments

1. The maneuvers described are at variance with those described by the
ground observers who reported what is believed to be the same sighting (Reference
Det 1, 600th AIS Intelligence Series Squadron Reports No 52-93 and 52-94).

2. The performance reported indicates that the object was possibly a light
carried by a high-performance aircraft.

3. Location of the sighting was just south of Chorwon, approximately 180
miles from Ansung.

4. Due to the erratic maneuvers of the object it may have been impossible for
the F-94 to look radar contact, but no explanation has been found for failure of
the ground radar to "paint" the object at any time.
