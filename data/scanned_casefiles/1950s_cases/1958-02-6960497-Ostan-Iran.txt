1. Subject report has been reviewed by this Division, as requested. It is considered probable that the sightings of vapor trails (contrails) at high altitude over Babolsar, Iran, relate to twin-jet aircraft. The contrails could result from the engine effluxes. The most likely aircraft, considering the adjacent USSR areas, are BADGER and FLASHLIGHT. At high altitude, either aircraft could leave such contrails as reported, without the vehicle itself being seen.

2. This Division does not attach any special significance to the sightings as reported. It is felt that use of binoculars (which apparently were not available in the instances reported) would in the future permit positive identification of the type of aircraft involved. (UNCLASSIFIED)

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
ORIGINATING AGENCY: Tehran, Iran
REPORT NO: 12-134-58    PAGE: 2 of 2 PAGES

1. Reproduced verbatim below is a memorandum to the Assistant Director, USAF/I, dated 11 February 1958:

TO: Robert C. Maner, Assistant Director, Tehran
FROM: Area Development Advisor, Ostan 2, Babolsar
SUBJECT: Unidentified Objects in the Sky

Considerable excitement and speculation was caused by the passage of an unidentified aircraft over the area at approximately 12:30 on Sunday, February 9th. The plane was so high that it could not be seen and the sound of its motors was barely audible. It passed over the Caspian Sea and proceeded in easterly direction toward Gorgan. Only two water streams were visible. The local population speculated that it might be a Russian missile or a satellite. It is my belief that it was a stratospheric jet plane.

2. Reproduced verbatim below is a memorandum to the Assistant Director, USAF/I, submitted by IR Area Development Advisor, Ostan 2, Babolsar, 15 February 1958:

TO: Assistant Director, USAF/I, Tehran
FROM: Area Development Advisor, Ostan 2, Babolsar
SUBJECT: Unidentified Objects in the Sky

Referring to my memorandum of 11 February 1958, subject "Flight of Jet Plane over Area", the following additional unidentified objects have been reported being seen in the area:

a. A confirmed report that an object similar to the one reported in my memo of 11 February passed from east to west along the southern shore of the Caspian at approximately 11 AM, Friday, February 14th.

b. An unconfirmed report that fishermen saw an unidentified light passing through the sky over the Caspian on the night of February 12th.

The population seems to be getting missile conscious and are engaging in speculation that these objects are Russian missiles.

3. Reproduced verbatim below is a memorandum to the Assistant Director, USAF/I, submitted by IR Area Development Advisor, Ostan 2, Babolsar, dated March 1958:

TO: Assistant Director, USAF/I, Tehran
FROM: Area Development Advisor, Ostan 2, Babolsar
SUBJECT: Unidentified Object in the Sky

On 17 February, a fourth unidentified object was seen in the sky. The other three had been previously reported. This object consisted of thin elongated appearance, approaching the Caspian from the south with at approximately 0610 hrs, ascending the northern section of Zafar, Iran. The object was seen from the Caspian Sea circle toward the east and disappeared in a south by slightly east direction in approximately 30 minutes. It appeared to me to be a jet plane at approximately 30,000 feet.
