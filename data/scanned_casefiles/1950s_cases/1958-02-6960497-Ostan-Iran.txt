The text in the document is as follows:

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

IRAN, TABRIZ 

1. This report is submitted on the incident of a round, silvery object observed near Tabriz, Iran on 2 February 1958. The object was first reported by two Iranian fishermen and later sighted by other observers including military personnel.

2. Major ______________, Assistant Director, USAFW, Tehran, advised by Area Development Advisor, Ostan 2, Tabriz that:

a. Confidentiality was requested and precision was caused by the rumor that the object was of US origin. It passed directly over the Tabriz Air Base at an estimated speed of 400-500 knots and at an altitude of 10-15,000 feet. This rapid speed and unusual maneuvering indicated the object was not an aircraft. It is my belief that it was a USAF experimental jet plane.

3. Submitted by: ______________, Area Development Advisor, Ostan 2, Tabriz.

4. Assis tant Director, USAFC, Tehran - Major ________________, advised by Area Development Advisor, Ostan 2, Tabriz, dated 7 March 1958:

a. The incident as reported is substantially correct. This object was sighted by two Iranian fishermen and later by additional observers including military personnel. It is confirmed that the object was similar to the one reported in my memo of 18 February 1958, subject: "Flight of Jet Aircraft".

b. The fishermen saw an unidentified "light" passing through the sky over the Caspian on the night of 2 February 1958.

c. The population became excited that these objects are Russian missiles and are engaged in a special mission.

d. It is recommended that the Assistant Director, USAFC, Tehran, Major ________________, Area Development Advisor, Ostan 2, Tabriz, dated 7 March 1958, be informed of this incident.
