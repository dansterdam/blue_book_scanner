10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Flat obj, size of dime, turned to shiney silver to deep red. One obj broke into three major obj. No definite formation.

11. COMMENTS
The witness probably saw the planet Mars. A very high layer is probably responsible for the illusion that the obj broke into three obj. In fact, the long period of time that the obj was visible & apparent absence of motion supports this conclusion. Mars was at a position coincident with that right by the witness.
