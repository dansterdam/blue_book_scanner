1. The targets which moved and then became stationary are believed to have resulted from a possible temperature inversion that would justify false echoes from ground targets. However, this report is the first to detail so long an airborne pursuit of UFO's, and it is surprising to find the radar operating normally on a target of this type.

2. The fact that 16 targets originally appeared on the PPI scope, but only 2 were observed on the AI radar tends to substantiate the spurious response theory. Also, it cannot be positively established that the 2 AI targets were part of the original 16 targets. It would be possible for the radar to malfunction during the flight and still check out after the flight but would be unlikely.

3. There is not sufficient data upon which to make a firm evaluation, and any additional information would be welcomed. This is a very interesting report, well prepared, and the incidents which happened cannot be satisfactorily explained.

1. To redevelop the incident, as it evolved in chronological order, each of the organizations having knowledge of pertinent factors were visited and appropriate personnel interrogated.

2. The site initiating the alert was the CP5-L radar searching under the control of the 19th AACS Squadron. This site operates with a mission of controlling airway traffic in the Tokyo area. Radar surveillance and positive control in generally utilized only in the area of the Tokyo metropolitan control events as they were evidenced is as follows:

At approximately 1613Z (local time) the Tokyo Radar Traffic Control Center located at Haneda Air Base, Japan, in its usual capacity of controlling airway traffic in the Tokyo area, had under control four aircraft. Two aircraft were inbound from the South and under control of one of the radar controllers. The other controller had a C-47 inbound from Bizan to Tachikawa via Yokota Air Base at 16,000 ft. He also had a B-50 which had taken off from Yokota at 1613Z, on a tactical round robin, which ended near Yokota at 16:20Z. Since the controller wished to expedite the climb of the B-50, which was now restricted to 5,000 ft to the C-47 traffic, he switched to short range on his PPI and moved his off-center C-47 position, which had been at the 350° position looking to the South, to the 150° position. At this setting he was unintentionally the sector to the northernmost four or five approximately 52 miles. At about this time the C-47 had been cleared to contact Tachikawa (CA 1A15Y), at 16:00 position, the controller observed what he took to be initially four aircraft due North of Johnson radar site partially out the scope. To get a better look at these targets he moved the off-centered position to the 150° position so that he was looking at the targets. He now observed a total of sixteen targets in six formations. Their position was approximately due North of Johnson and at range 52 miles. These targets appeared to him to be moving in a southeasterly direction. As the controller observed the targets moving apparently in a southeasterly direction, he called Bitburg, the GM/GCI site located at Chiba Peninsula, to ascertain their knowledge of these targets moving from 360° to 020° in the ten minute period from 1621 to 1631. As a result of the call, he subsequently, through AACS at Johnson, on a B-50 was scrambled from Yokota Air Base.

At approximately the same time the Tokyo TATCC controller observing targets moving across the scope in an erratic motion leaving a trace similar to that observed by the controller from Haneda. Bitburg again notified that this movement could only be detected by covering the targets with grease pencil and observing them in a certain area. In other words, on duty at the site, from an adjacent room, the targets had a summary of a radio position. The other controller on duty did not have a chance to get in his scope to observe these targets to the North, since he was radar combination observer traffic. So the South Pacific Air Force at 360° position and looking only to the South. No one else at Tokyo AACS made observation of these targets during this ten minute period.

3. At Yokota Air Base the pilot of the scrambled F-86N was intercepted to gain control of his observation. On 10 Mar, 1st Lt. G. R. Marks, AO 1025457, 3915 was on five minutes alert when the scramble order arrived at approximately 1632E. He was at Naha approximately 1036E and immediately van under GCI control. He was given a vector of 350° at "Mangla" 10, and was told that Tokyo radar had 16 miles in the area.

Since "Butterfly" was not painting these targets merely controlled his through a search of the area. He was further vectored 270°, then 130° and then turned again on a northerly heading. Shortly after turning to this northerly heading he slicked up 2 radar blips at approximately one thirty and 130 miles ahead. Into these targets and look them in the turn. After making about a 45° turn he rolled out again and had one bogey in approximately 2 miles and 130 miles ahead. In maneuvering into this target and 20 the target in the 12 o'clock position. He reported to GCI, and they asked him for identification man. At this time he had an overall indication of from 100 to 175 knots. He was in a Sabermarker more indicating about -65 - -66 knots. At 15 miles he got an indication of black and closed down to 6 miles where he switched scope and kept closing. At 2 1/2 to 3 miles range his 20 seconds to go lights began to collect. Around the target, since his rate of approach was relatively high he came back out of afterburner. The target came back through 20 seconds to go. At this time he was out of afterburner and at -65, then to a -50. As he saw a -25 he went back into afterburner operation and managed to hold about a -50 as the target ran out to about 15 miles high. He followed the target through this turn, still in trail, when shortly after that he was approximately 020 and all of this time he had been flying at 10,000 ft. He then got an indication that the target was climbing. At this time he and closed range to about 5 miles. By this time he was not able to get those he was looking at. He then realized that he was in a climb to about 16,000 ft. He then realized that he had overshot a little and that the Sabre was at about 15,000 ft. So he began a letdown again still in afterburner. At the 15,000 ft. level, he made a turn and revealed of an and began to expand range - he went back to his 30 mile scope as the range of the bogey expanded through 7 - 8 then 9 miles. Since he was at 15,000 ft. he began a shallow dive. In this dive his speed naturally increased - he went through wing roll at about 94 then saw 197 and 198. During this time the rate of closure continued to decrease and gradually went over to the 1300 position with a relatively rate of closure indication of about 200 knots. At 15 miles he got lock and shortly thereafter GCI gave him a vector back to base.

The two targets which he picked up initially were in his opinion normal radar targets. These targets were right together at the one thirty position and were similar in appearance to two aircraft in formation. The range of these two blips were as large, or larger than, the return from another target. They were nearly defined and appeared to be normal radar return. His impression was that his radar equipment was very good with a clear (silky) scope. At about this range and normal pattern showing up at maximum range. At the time he was within minimum range he feels that he was within approximately 2 1/2 miles and had about 15 seconds to go. (This was the time he came to a final closing range). Since he was trying to establish identification on his target, he didn't want to go below 15,000 ft. He was in solid weather from 1100 ft. until he went through 1100 ft. on landing. He was pilot Layne Marks that the target was definitely one of the targets that he had picked up while searching. The

target had changed azimuth as he turned into it, changed range and his presentation
was changed normally to that he has observed on occasions when he has worked practice
intercepts with a "what float". During the entire encounter he was in contact with
butterfly to ascertain that they watched terrain clearance for him since he knew
he was flying in an area with mountainous terrain reached close to his altitude. He
was continuously transmitting to butterfly information about actions of the Yogi -
the facts that he had located on a width 20 yards to his 11 o'clock. All communications with butterfly were on UHF channel 5 frequency. He had taken off on
channel 2 - switched to channel 10 - then alt occasionally was exchanged with
5. His LFT transponder was on Mode 2 throughout the encounter. Although he could
not see the other aircraft, since he was processed with a "chase" during the first
that his position was generally north and northeast of Yokota area and in the vicinity
of Hixko. His estimates of time throughout the encounter was not more than 15 minutes
probably from 10 to 15 minutes. The elapsed time from takeoff until the widow of
the two radar was approximately 1.5 minutes. The pilot feels that the only thing
that was exceptional about the encounter was the rate of negative closure. The rate
of negative closure was described as unlike. The conversation when flying in trail
with another 250 and have him go into a "starburner" operation while you are sighting
that booted at low Mach not expecting it. He was, of course, indicating 4-97 on this
occasion. At the time of break into was still holding the target at 1200 o'clock
position under the "Mizals band".

COMMENTS of the Preparing Officer:

4. The radar which made the observations, as mentioned before, is a GPS-1,
and is used primarily for airway traffic control in the Tokyo area. In their present
operation they have two "PSPI" scopes in the operations room both of which are normally utilized in the off-centered position at 360° scanning to the South. An "A"
scope is utilized for west and calibration and is located in an adjacent room.

5. The controllers working these scopes in normal operations are controlling
traffic South of the radar location and are not familiar with the normal ground
return in the areas other than those normally viewed to the South.

6. The controller on duty is a 5-level airman who is OJT for 7-level. He has
twenty months experience in traffic control work and is familiar with the radar
control of aircraft as his location. He is familiar with normal radar returns
(aircraft targets) and with the normal ground returns South of the Johnson area,
however, he as well as the other controllers, was not familiar with the normal ground
return patterns throughout 360° from the site.

7. The ground return to the Northeast from Johnson is excessive sharp and
more highly defined than the ground return normally associated with the area radar
return.

8. The scope which the controller was using at the time of the incident was
operating normally and used for control immediately prior to and after the incident.
At this time of the incident another controller had known aircraft under positive
control to the South.

9. The maintenance NCOIC conducted the preparing officer through the site on
a check of the facility. He, the NCOIC, is very familiar with the GPS-1 system
and has particular installation knowledge. He made a permanent echo pattern
throughout 360° and with the permanent echo which he uses for antenna alignment
and functional check of this installation. A setup of the conditions under which
the observations were made by the controller was made. The permanent echoes to the
northeast of the site are completely off the scope at the 160° and 180° off-centered

10. No logical explanation for the possible misorientation of the presented information on the PPI in use can be found.

11. The controller does not now recall whether or not he ever did see either the G-47 or the T-50 since his attention was distracted by the presence of the multiple targets.

12. The pilot of the F-86D has approximately 565 hours total time with 100 hours in the F-86D and approximately 120 hours in the 576 F.B. He has a total of 15 hours of actual weather time.

13. The pilot's rough estimate of his position and the time of the actual engagement was approximately 15 minutes for the instance, GCI records show a time of 14 minutes.

14. As soon as the aircraft was on the ground the NGOTC of radar maintenance and the Hughes technical representative made a check of the complete fire control system. The system was found to be operating normally in all respects with no exception of the closing traps indicator. This could include an error which would give a plus 30 knot error in closing speed, otherwise no other system errors noted.

15. The technical representative and the Operations Officer of the 35th Squadron were impressed that the pilot was familiar with the F-86D fire control system, and that indications were that he determined, normal radar functioning.

16. The switch in range mentioned in paragraph #5 of this report is a modification in this Chanadar fire control system. While modification was made to facilitate identification runs from azimers. Effectively, this modification merely blows up the last 6 miles of range so that range can be read more accurately for this identification type pass.

17. Enclosures #1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were prepared by Tokyo Weather Central, 1st. rather wing and cover the weather situation affecting the area. Enclosure #5, shows in the synopsis altitude, surface winds, temperature inversions from 8,000 to the 10,000 ft levels.

18. At the time the F-86D was in the air there were no known friendly aircraft in the area from which a rational check obtained the possibility that the identified target was a friendly aircraft.

19. No conclusion can be reached from this individual incident as to what the radar, target or terrain could have been. It is occasionally difficult to establish a tie in between the ground radar observations and the observations of the pilot of the airborne aircraft.
