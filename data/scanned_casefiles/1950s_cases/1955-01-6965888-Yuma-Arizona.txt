TO:   Director Special Investigations
       Headquarters, USAF
       Washington 25, D.C.

1. SYNOPSIS:
   Informants, alleged that on 17 January 1955 they observed an unidentified flying object and described the object as being in the shape of a light bulb and appeared to be somewhat larger than a jet fighter with a white phosphorous glow. A white phosphorous object was described as being of a flare type variety with a green tinge.

2. TITLE:
   On 17 January 1955 from Yucca, California, and [redacted], California, stated that at approximately 1730 hours on that date, they had observed an unidentified flying object heading southeast. They described the object as being in the shape of a light bulb, that it appeared to be larger than a jet fighter plane with a white phosphorous glow. They said that the object was traveling at a very high altitude, and in a matter of seconds the object descended to a low altitude of approximately forty (40) feet, at which time he was approximately 200 feet away from the object. They said the object disappeared in a southeasterly direction, that it emitted no sound.

3. On 14 January 1955 [redacted], California, advised that at approximately 1730 hours on 17 January 1955 he observed an unidentified flying object.

[Most of the text in the body of the document is too illegible to read clearly. There is a signature at the bottom of the page, but the name is not clearly discernible.]

The document appears to be an official military or government form with multiple sections, but the details are not readable due to the poor image quality and low contrast.

The image appears to be a document with multiple numbered lines, but the text is largely illegible due to poor image quality and low contrast. While some text fragments are visible, I cannot confidently transcribe most of the text with certainty. The document seems to be a form or report with a structured layout, but the specific details are not clear from this scan.

The document appears to be an "Air Intelligence Information Report" with multiple sections. However, due to the low image quality and faded text, much of the content is illegible. The header of the document is partially visible, showing "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top, but the specific details are difficult to read clearly. The document seems to be a standard military form with numbered sections, but the text within those sections is mostly unreadable.
