The bright object was without
doubt Venus - Astro chart and
computer confirms this. (The
red light is bleieved to be the
red hazard light on the San
Antonio Peak, which was in the
line of sight.
Oval object, size of half dollar,
bright white. Stationary then faded out.
Small red light nearby, but did not
believe it was related to first object.
