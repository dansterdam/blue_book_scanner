BRADSHAW could add no further information pertinent to this inquiry.

5. At 0010 hours, 6 March 1954, Captain WILLIAM M. FORD, AO 457110, Aircraft Commander, C-47 #2684, advised 3/4 MATCH that at approximately 2150 hours while flying at 2000 feet indicated altitude under GCA control, on down-wind leg heading 170°, he observed a white light, with no bright or dim change in intensity, directly ahead of his course at approximately the same altitude and heading in a westerly direction, i.e., on a collision course. He passed on the down-wind leg, FORD continued, the light appeared to be ahead directly towards his aircraft. At this point, FORD was called GCA and requested to know whether or not another direction was in use. GCA replied that they had remained similar course during evening and that the GCA scope did not reflect other aircraft in the area. Upon completion of turn on base leg, FORD stated, the light disappeared for approximately 10-15 seconds. When it was apparent again, FORD continued, it appeared to be moving and it remained "out until completion of turn onto final approach, at which time it disappeared behind his aircraft. FORD stated that he could furnish no additional identifying data on other aircraft observed.

FORD's co-pilot, Lieutenant J. W. GILCHRIST, AO 3022070, reiterated the same facts. The navigator, Captain JESS F. PHILLIPS, AO 720070, while agreeing with FORD's and GILCHRIST's statements, added that the light appeared to him to be an "amber" color. FORD volunteered that he had eleven (11) years experience as pilot and that he has never had a similar experience.

6. At 0000 hours, 6 March 1954, BRADSHAW (previously identified) advised 3/4 MATCH that crew personnel had reported only one (1) aircraft, a C-47 #5289, on Nouasseur Air Depot. All other flights from that base during evening of 5 March 1954, were local 30-35 mile radius flights which remained in the local area of 30-35 miles.

They stated that at this time, they observed two (2) white lights to the right of their course at approximately the same altitude. Though they could only see the lights, they believe them to be two (2) aircraft in formation or one (1) light was slightly lower than the other. The above Crew further pointed out that the lights were seen from the lights due to the fact that the lights appeared to have been approaching their aircraft on a collision course. Landing was made with one (1) additional takeoff and landing without any other observations. However, following the subsequent takeoff, and again, while on down-wind leg, same altitude and heading, they observed two (2) white lights approaching them from 180°, and on a collision course. They immediately made a 360° turn. While in the turn, they observed one (1) aircraft with running lights approximately the (2) miles West of the station at approximately the same altitude. They completed two (2) additional landings with no further observations.

Neither BOHN nor his Crew could furnish any identifying data as to size, shape, speed, etc. of alleged aircraft/object.

14. On 9 March 1954, 1st Lieutenant HARRY J. SAVOY advised the writer that targets/objects which had been reported at 210,000 feet twelve (12) miles South of the station during evening of 9 March 1954, were unidentified. SAVOY explained that on 9 March, as reported during the previous evening, continued to remain stationary on Radar Scope on a bearing of 185°. Usual check of area. SAVOY, additional no further information, "atmospheric phenomena" is responsible for this type of target appearing on the Radar Scope. SAVOY could add no further pertinent information.

15. Major CHESTER F. KERZUN, AC 1011165, Base Intelligence Officer, Southern Air Material Area, APO 30, USAF, was kept orally advised at all times of the above reported events as they occurred.

1. At 2000%, 5 March 1954 the Comd and Tr-108 primary search and
hot sighting radar at R16 A14, this unit, was put into operation from
a "standby" status upon receipt of an 1-A message from Nouasseur Air
Base by Homebase Air Base Operations. Base Operations and the CCA
unit at Nouasseur reported that a strange unidentified object was
called in reports of draft making passes at there was no description of the aircraft. At approximately 1950, the pilot of KC-97 2595 reported seeing an (?) object at 12 o'clock high at 1500 feet over Nouasseur.

At 2005, the pilot of a C-119 aircraft at 191st and 192nd and 1949
AF (Strat) at 6250', a KC-97 made the report. The reports were by a
high (strat) unit (a) plus one of this aircraft who were similar in being
high with the (a) plus one of this aircraft who were similar in landing
pattern. The pilot of the C-119 reported a similar sighting. Later approximately was not more than 2 miles distant sighting his time.

2. The weather at the time of the report sighting was as follows:
clear, no clouds, no haze, and visibility over (7) miles.

COPY OF THE PREPARING OFFICER

1. The source of the above information is considered to be reliable
and the information given herein is considered to be true and correct
to the best of my knowledge. The source is the intelligence officer,
NAVAL, from Nouasseur Air Base, French Morocco.

2. To my knowledge this report was first made by the intelligence
officer (ia) to the operations (IA) officer also of Nouasseur Air Base. At 2000, a verbal report was made by the intelligence officer to the
base operations, hence, no action was made by the SAC.

3. It was the consensus of opinion of intelligence officers and the
pilot personnel present that the object was a high tension electrical line at the power of a high tension electrical line at the most
solid on the power line.

4. Paragraph three (3) above does not explain the reported sighting
by pilot of unidentified aircraft at approximately 1500 feet and air (6)
to sight (5) miles east of Nouasseur Air Base.
