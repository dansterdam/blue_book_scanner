BRADSHAW could add no further information pertinent to this inquiry.

11 MARCH 1944 - Captain WILLIAM H. FORD, AD 4521H. At 0230 hours 
while flying at 5,000 feet indicated altitude, his attention was drawn 
to what appeared to be a small light flitting across his path at a 
considerable distance, traveling in an east-west direction. The light 
was brilliant and sharply defined. It was spotted almost due south of 
the aircraft and disappearing behind the left wing seemed to diminish 
rapidly in size as the distance between the aircraft and the light 
increased. The light appeared for approximately two to three seconds.

FORD continued his mission, but the light did not reappear. He made no 
attempt to close on the light, as it gave the appearance of traveling 
at a tremendous rate of speed. FORD stated this incident was an isolated one and that he attached no special significance to it.

FORD'S co-pilot, Lieutenant I. V. GILCHRIST, AG 30 228 769, 
corroborated FORD'S account.

At 0030 hours, 6 March 1944, BRADSHAW (previously unidentified) 
reported he had been unable to locate a definite target or targets. He 
was (1) aircraft, speed 175 (225?), 58 miles SW of NOUASSEUR. He had 
made several runs, and other aircraft was, at times, visible. He broke 
off at 0045 hours due to lack of definite target.

On 6 March 1954, V/C GEORGE D. VAN DYKE, AF 11215726, stated that on that day at 1900 hours, he and four other officers of the 2402 base personnel were near the site of a crashed object which had occurred the prior evening. This report is in reference to the report submitted by V/C VAN DYKE. 

VAN DYKE stated that while inspecting the reports indicating the presence of unidentified objects which had appeared over this area, he had discovered that one report showed the objects were circling the Traffic Control Tower at the base, and that he was informed by USAF personnel that three persons had been in the room at the time and had witnessed the objects. VAN DYKE stated that conditions were as follows: (1) clear, (2) lights - runway in use - amber in color, (3) no wind. 

VAN DYKE further stated that USAF Air Traffic Control personnel had made certain observations which they did not wish to include in writing. These included such things as the objects' ability to accelerate from a standstill to high speed in the blink of an eye, and the fact that one of the objects came within 300 yards of the control tower and then rapidly climbed straight up until out of sight. VAN DYKE added that neither he nor the other 4 officers were able to make any worthwhile visual identification as the objects were extremely high and fast moving.

On 6 March 1954, Major RICHARD B. MC GANN, AO 798377, Wing Intelligence Officer, 406th Bomb Wing, USAF, stated that at approximately 1900 hours on 5 March 1954, an unidentified aerial object/objects was/were observed to make a high speed run over the base area. He said that the object(s) was/were observed by members of the 406th Bomb Wing and that they had not been able to make a positive identification of it/them.

On 6 March 1954, V/O JOSEPH K. GROSSMAN, AF 12384667, 1975-1 GCA Operator, stated that on 5 March 1954, at approximately 2030 hours, he had observed two unidentified aerial objects through the GCA radar scope. He said the objects were traveling at a very high rate of speed and that they were observed for approximately 10-15 seconds before disappearing from the scope. GROSSMAN added that the GCA had been tracking these objects and that their conditions were as described by VAN DYKE.

24-16
(10) mile search loops indicated that lighting, which was reported
to be in the northwest, was actually toward the east. This sighting
was observed by two pilots and two GC (OREONAN controller) personnel.
It was recommended that no action be taken on this sighting since
it does not involve any objective evidence. 
(2) Five to eight seconds (3-5) sightings by two (2) pilots.

GROSSMAN further advised that the target, reported by GCA
as reflected on the Control Tower (AZ) scope, was not seen visually
by the pilots under GCA control. Although the target showed distinctly
on the GCA scope, the pilots were unable to acquire it visually.
Numbar 35.- GROSSMAN could add no further pertinent information.

1. 15 March 1954. Captain ROBERT R. SADLIE, AO 6781101, Lieut-
enant PAUL A. GAUCH, AO 2231172, and Lieutentant GEORGE A. KERR,
AO 2232460, c. 1133-1135Z. Air Refueling Squadron 3031, Desert at a point
7 miles SE of Nouasseur Tower, altitude 10,000 feet, observed one bright
light in the northeast, which was stationary and changed to dim and bright
while under GCA control, as observed by the pilots. The light appeared to
the left of their course and was held in their sight for approximately 3
minutes. The light appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 10,000
feet, which was the altitude of the aircraft. They stated that: (1) Light
started as a bright light, then dimmed to a dull glow and brightened again.
(2) Light appeared to change and vary in intensity, (3) it moved erratically
and seemed to accelerate and decelerate, and (4) It gave the impression of
being intelligently controlled. The pilots stressed that they were under GCA
control at the time of the sighting, and the light appeared to be at approximately the same altitude as their aircraft.

The Crew stated that they believed the light to be jet aircraft in a
vertical plight. However, they could not identify it as such. Nine lights
were sighted.

lights at an altitude of 15,000 feet between 1215Z - 1220Z while in the
vicinity of Nouasseur over the Medina River. These lights appeared to be
following a circular course and suddenly disappeared. They reported that
the lights appeared to be larger than a star and were yellow-white in color.
The pilots stated they were unable to identify the lights.

They stated that at this time, they observed two (2) white lights in the right or their aircraft. Through observation, the lights appeared to be approximately (1) mile in length, and about (2) miles in width. (1) light was steady and the other (1) light was pulsating. The lights were approximately 1,000 feet in altitude and were traveling at a high rate of speed. The lights were observed for approximately 5 minutes and then disappeared. No sound from their aircraft or the lights was heard. 

On 2 March 1954, Lt Colonel HARRY J. SAVIE received the twelfth (12) Official U.S. Air Force REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS from the NOUASSEUR Air Base, French MOROCCO. The report states that on 25 FEBRUARY 1954 at 2045 hours, local time, the control tower operator and the Weather Officer observed two (2) unidentified lights in the sky. The lights were observed for approximately 30 minutes. The lights were described as being white in color and moving at a high rate of speed. They were approximately 2 to 3 thousand feet in altitude and approximately 5 to 10 miles from the air base. No sound was heard from the lights. The report is corroborated by the Weather Officer and the Control Tower Operator.

PLACE OF OBSERVATION: NOUASSEUR, FRENCH MOROCCO
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 12 MARCH 1954
TIME OF OBSERVATION: APPROXIMATELY 1645H
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: UFO 
EVALUATION: A-2

1. At approximately 1645H on 12 March 1954, an object described as a large, brilliant white light was observed by the French Military Authorities at Nouasseur, French Morocco. The object was first sighted at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet and its speed was estimated at 3,000 mph. The object changed direction at high speed on several occasions and eventually disappeared from sight at an extremely high altitude. No sound was associated with the object. Attempts to track the object by radar were unsuccessful.

2. The object was under constant observation for approximately 10 minutes. It was reported to have been of a very definite shape, as indicated by the brilliance of the light rather than the actual contours. The visual and radar tracking attempts failed to produce a positive identification of the object.
