New "Saucer" Reports Rise
"Telephone Pole" Flies Over City, People Say

GALENA, Ill., Feb. 4.—(UP)— Mayor Ray Logan said today he was flooded with calls from persons who claimed they saw a 300-foot long, brilliant red "telephone pole" fly over Galena last night.

And it was only a "typical Saturday night" in Galena, the mayor said, meaning that the revelry wasn't so great that people were seeing things.

This report in this northern Illinois town near the Wisconsin border coincided with observations of a brilliant blue flash, believed caused by a meteor, over central Wisconsin.

Witnesses said the pole was shaped something like a baseball bat and glided noiselessly along, not very high and not very fast. Logan said "very reputable and responsible" persons first called him about the object, and that since he has received numerous reports from others here and in communities to the north.

"The descriptions given me were pretty much the same," Logan said. "I'm still getting calls."

The police department said that a half dozen motorists reported that they nearly had accidents when they saw the pole pass over.

Witnesses said the pole first appeared over a section known as Irish Hollow and was brilliant red in color.

Virginia Bodie, the local telephone operator, said she saw the object while on her way to work and it nearly scared her to death.

Later reports said the pole was seen from as far as 50 miles northward, and Logan said he received reports from the north that it was blue over Wisconsin.
