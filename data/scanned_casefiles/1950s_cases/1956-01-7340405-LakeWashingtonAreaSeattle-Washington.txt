COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. In the opinion of the investigating officer this sighting was undoubtedly caused by the star SIRIUS for the following reasons:

    a. The position of the star SIRIUS as plotted by the University of Washington Observatory correlates very closely with SOURCE'S estimated observation and bearing.

    b. During the period of this observation, this area has had unusually clear nights. This condition in an area accustomed to nightly overcast, at this time of year, would tend to attract undue attention to particularly bright stars.

    c. The fact that SOURCE observed object on succeeding nights in approximately the same position on each occasion indicates very strongly that sighting was astronomical.

    d. Both sources stated that they now believe the object to be a particularly bright star.

II. RELIABILITY:
    SOURCE was interviewed via telephone, however, he seemed sincere and gave answers in a clear and precise manner. In view of SOURCE's age and lack of technical background information is considered to be only fairly reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
     1. SOURCE stated that he first observed reported object at 31/0230Z Jan 56, from his home in Seattle, Washington (SECRET DKRC 1035). It was completely dark and the sky was clear. SOURCE stated object was round in shape and about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. Object was bright and appeared to flicker like a star and appeared to change colors including white, amber, blue and green. Then first observed, SOURCE stated object was squarely at his position or approximately 160° at an elevation of 15°.
     Object slowly moved to 180° and elevation increased to 200 by 31/0730Z Jan 56. SOURCE stated that object had been visible in approximately the same position since original sighting and he now believes it to be a star.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. Dr Jacobson of the University of Washington Observatory was contacted and plotted the position of known bright stars and planets which might correlate with the information received in the UFOB report. Dr Jacobson reported that the star SIRIUS was visible and very bright during the period of this UFOB observation. The position and elevation of SIRIUS from observers position and time of observation was as follows: 31/0330Z Jan 56, 16° elevation, 139° bearing and 31/0730Z Jan 56, 24° elevation, 200° bearing. Dr Jacobson stated that SIRIUS is in the brightest visible fixed star with a magnitude of minus 1.6. This star is predominantly bluish white with variation.

2. The Seattle Filter Center was contacted and indicated they had received the original UFOB report from a Boy Scout in Seattle, Wash. at 31/0325Z Jan 56. The observer was William K. Bond, 2217 E. 170th Seattle, Washington. Gladstone 6819, The scout troop reported taking compass bearings and state the object was 120° from their position at an elevation of approximately 20°. This information was passed to the controller on duty with the 635th AC & W Sq, McChord AFB, Wash.

3. The Fleet "either office at Sand Point Naval Air Station was queried concerning balloon releases and reported the following: large RAWINDSONDES BALLOON was launched from that station GECREF DKNG 4541 at 31/0231Z Jan 56. This balloon had an ascent rate of approximately 1000 feet per minute and expanded to a diameter of 20-25 feet at maximum altitude. A train of equipment was attached to the balloon including weather instruments, parachute and one small light. From the launching place this balloon moved due south and at 31/0330Z Jan 56 was at an altitude of 58,596 feet at a position 42 miles due south of Sand Point Naval Air Station. The balloon burst at 31/0350 Jan 56 at an altitude of 88,921 feet. Balloons of this type are released from this station daily on schedule.

4. McChord AFB weather office reported generally clear skies during time of sighting. Winds were 010°/37 knots at 10,000 feet, 030/63 knots at 13,000, 010/38 knots at 30,000 and 350/78 knots at 34,000 feet. There were three separate temperature inversions in the area. These inversions covered the following levels: 710 Millibars - 730 Millibars, 300 Millibars - 250 Millibars, 228 Millibars - 213 Millibars.

5. 1/Lt CJ. Gundelfinger (GCI Controller at McChord AFB) received the original report from Seattle Filter Center at approximately 31/0330Z Jan 56. Lt Gundelfinger checked with Seattle ATC who informed him that there were no IFR flight plans in the area. There were no indications on the GCI radar scope. At 3l/0455 Z, Lt Gundelfinger directed F-86 D aircraft, which were on a training flight, to the Lake Washington area, The F-86 D pilots circled the area for several minutes and reported negative sighting to the GCI controller. Lt Gundelfinger stated that in his opinion the observers reporting the sighting were watching a star.

6. 1/Lt Richard G. Thomas, Flt leader and 2/Lt John Underwood, 318 Ftr Sq, call sign Truman, Baker 1 2, took off at approximately 31/0450 Jan 56 and were diverted at 0455Z by Mercury (GCI) to Lake Washington area in vicinity of Floating bridge. ROCKNE DKC 1535. At 8000 feet they circled the area for approximately 5 minutes and the only thing sighted was a patch of thin haze off the east side of Lake Washington at 5000 - 6000 feet. The weather was clear, in the entire area except for light haze. It was moderately dark and the moon was not up. Stars were visible at bright. GCI reported no unusual sightings to pilots and no contact was made on airborne radar.

Crly one aircraft was observed taking off from Sea-Tac on a south course as the F-86 Ds were leaving the area. There was no turbulence. Lt Thomas stated that shortly before taking off another pilot pointed out a particularly bright star in the Southeast.
