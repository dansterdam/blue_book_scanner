PARA 1 10 US EMBASSY OFFICIALS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT SOME ORGANIZING ACTIVITY HAS TAKEN PLACE IN KARACHI CONCERNING UFOs REPORTS. THE INVITATION TO GOVERNORS APPARANTLY REFERS TO FIRST CONFERENCE GOING TO BE HELD UNDER OFFICIAL AUSPICES FOR DISCUSSION CONCERNING UFOS. PLEASE ANNOUNCE CALL FOR COLLECTION OF CONCRETE EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION TO BE PRESENTED AT THIS CONFERENCE TO BE HELD IN KARACHI. SOUTH AND CENTRAL INDIA/PAKISTAN CAN BE CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT ASPECT DUE TO NUMEROUS REPORTS.

CONCLUSIONS DRAWN BASED ON DISCUSSION RESULTS IN RECOMMENDATION CONCERNING DISPUTE BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN RESULT FROM INDIAN OFFICIALS IN KARACHI TO EFFECT THAT UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS HAVE BEEN SIGHTED IN AREA, AND METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE HAS CONFIRMED PHOTOGRAPHS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. HOWEVER, OFFICIALS OF GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN MAINTAIN THAT AFGHCAHANIS TAN AIRPORT AND METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY SUCH SIGHTINGS OR PHOTOGRAPHS. THIS LEAD TO SUGGESTION THAT INVITATION ISSUED TO OFFICIALS IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN MAY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ISSUED UNILATERALLY BY OFFICIALS IN KARACHI WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. THERE IS ALSO AGGRAVATED BY SUGGESTION THAT REPORTS ON THIS MATTER MAY HAVE BEEN USED FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES. GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN DOES NOT ONLY COME TO THIS CASE BUT ALSO FOR INCREASED DEVELOPMENT OF NOT ONLY COME TO THIS CASE BUT ALSO FOR INCREASED DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSLUCENT CIRCULAR OBJECTS BY OTHERS PP THIS 4 OBJECTS REPUTED LIKE TRANSLUCENT CIRCULAR OBJECTS BY OTEHRS PP THIS 4 OBJECTS REPUTED

THE FLYING AT HIGH ALTITUDE AND HIGH SPEED LEAVING WHITE OR SMOKY TRAIL WHICH HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN SIGHTED. OFFICIALS OF GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN MAINTAIN THAT SUCH SIGHTINGS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED, BUT THEY DIFFER FROM PAKISTANI OFFICIALS IN KARACHI, WHO CLAIM THAT UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS HAVE BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED AND IDENTIFIED BY METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE. BASED ON THIS DISPUTE, AND VARYING REPORTS, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT PROPOSED CONFERENCE IN KARACHI MAY NOT BE FULLY REPRESENTATIVE AND THAT UFO REPORTS SHOULD BE VERIFIED INDEPENDENTLY BEFORE ANY CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN.
