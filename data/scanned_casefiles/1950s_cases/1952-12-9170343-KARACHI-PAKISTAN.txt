CAFIN:94713 (11 Dec 52)

Karachi press reported that Thursday morning (varying times between 0730 and 1000 AM) Four objects, believed "flying saucers", sighted and reported by several persons in Karachi area. Objects were said to look like white metal discs by some and like translucent circular objects by others. The fours objects reportedly were flying at high altitude and high speed leaving white smoke trail behind them. One reporter had different version stating "saucers" were actually aircraft flying at high altitude. The specific times reported by persons sighting these objects do not coincide with any RPAF high altitude operations in Karachi area for either jet or piston aircraft.

Four flying saucers looking like white metal discs and leaving a white smoky trail about 15 yards long flew in parallel formation over Karachi at about 3 a.m. yesterday at a great height and disappeared in the direction of the Karachi Industrial Trading Estate. This is the consensus of reports received from observers who telephoned or came to report in person. According to these observers, the phenomena was seen by scores of people in the streets. Possible explanations local authorities claim that about 7:50 a.m. four aircraft at a very high altitude over Karachi leaving vapor trails and offered this as a possible solution for the sighting.
