24 JUL 1953

1. The Air Technical Intelligence Center has received your message, HROI 7-0609, concerning a sighting of an F-80 pilot and a ground observer of an unidentified flying object 13 July 1953 at 2120 SST. This Center will take such action as may have been caused by local meteorological activity and requests that you determine from local newspapers and wire services the details of such activity at the time of sighting.

2. In order that this Center may have complete information on this dual observation, you will find included two USAF Technical Information sheets which should be completed by 2nd Lt Philip J. Shury and 1st Lt Whaley Sledge. An important item here is to stress the azimuth and elevation reading, one the object at its appearance and disappearance. Rapid transmission of these forms to the Air Technical Intelligence Center will aid in the attempted evaluation of this observation. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

27 July 1953

Dear Capt. Ruppelt and Lt. Olsson;

Greetings, Captain, and glad to have you aboard again. (Pardon the Navy expression.) Here are my comments on the last few items that were sent to us. Of the three cases, one was clearly a fireball and can be dismissed. The other two cases are definitely more revealing, particularly the recent "Kly" Arkansas of July 11. The questions we should like to have answered on this are stated on our regular Form "Eye." Little can be judged about it until we have this additional information.

The Shaw AFB one may have been a fireball but certainly an unusual one. If it was into the overcast, it probably was too much of a break out of the overcast, but it would be most unusual for one to come through the overcast, sail along for awhile, then back into the overcast. Therefore this case should be followed up. Again, the information we would like is on our Form "Eye."

I shall be in New Mexico on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (28,29,30) and will then travel, among other places, from Albuquerque to Las Vegas, thence to Ann Arbor and Boston. Then as Lt. Olsson has probably told you, I shall be in Europe all of September. I shall be on the watchout for phenomena over there. Last you be careful, this isn't as hot being charged to the project. I though if some legitimate occasion arises to track something down, I shall of course do so. I certainly hope to see you at least once before I leave.

Cordially,
[Signature]
Allen Hynek

P.S. I'll make forward to seeing you again, Eh. If you can manage to get enough free time to permit me, I'd like some time with those who are most interested to you. Your final report will hopefully see a thick one. We already have 150 pages of very interesting data. Might make quite a total, typical of many, well now in progress. Come in Columbus & observe and are active with this work sometimes - they are really amazing.

(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [Redacted]
SIGNATURE: [Redacted]
DATE: 20 Jul 53

(1) Object was observed in thin overcast, so no definite shape could be determined from the high which the aircraft was round in appearance, a pale white and reflected as much light as a white tip aircraft navigation light under the same conditions. There was only one and there was no trail or smoke. The object disappeared to the North in a horizontal part of the overcast.

(2) Object was sighted 12 July 1953 at 2123 Eastern Standard Time and was within sight for approximately seven seconds.

(3) The manner of observation was visual from the ground. The speed compared to a jet flying overhead at the time 250X, was estimated 550°, at an estimated 5,000 feet.

(4) My position at time of observation was Mobile Runway Control at the South end of runway 04, Shaw AFB, SC.

(5) Korean combat jet Photo Reconnaissance returns with 1300 hrs total military flying time. Witness was 1st Lt. Shug who is a Jet Photo Reconnaissance pilot, training.

(6) There was a thin broken to overcast condition at approximately 5,000 feet, which was estimated 1/10 from the Northwest and visibility was estimated 15 miles.

(7) There was no known meteorological conditions to cause such a sighting.

(8) There was no physical evidence or photographs of the sighting.

(C)   There was no interception action taken.

(DC)  There was only two aircraft flying the local area and I checked by radio with each and had them both in sight.

DATE: 20 July 1953

(1) Object seemed to be elliptical in shape, higher than wide and had a bright orange glow. A definite outline was noted, but no details on the object itself.

(2) Object seemed to be approximately half the size of a navy aircraft. It was flying, approximately 300', and was flying straight and level in a northwesterly course. It disappeared when pilot let down through a broken layer of clouds.

(3) Object was sighted at 2120 hours, 13 July 1953, and was under observation for approximately five seconds.

(4) Pilot was directly over Shaw AFB, S.C. and sighted object between Congaree National Guard Airport and Columbia, S.C., a distance of approximately twenty miles. Object was same level as aircraft (5000 feet) and moving on a heading of about 45 degrees.

(5) Other witness was 1st Ashley Blake, a Korean combat veteran, who was on duty at Mobile Control. Both of us are Photo Reconnaissance Pilots.

(6) There was broken stratus cloud layer at approximately 10,000 feet and 5,000 feet. Surface winds were light.

(7) No meteorological or other conditions were noted which might account for the sighting.

(8) No physical evidence was taken of the sighting.

18 - Very probably a meteor. Sending questionnaire. Ask your confirmation.
13 - Sending two questionnaires on this one since aerial and ground observation combined. Again this sounds like a meteor.
11 - Possibility here of upper air research balloon although our tracks on Moby Dick balloons show none in Arkansas for this date.

UAR activity starting from Carolina area, however. Sending questionnaires to various observers involved. Time is wrong (00152) for local balloon release. Carrying this as unsolved.

Dear Dr. Hynck:

It has been sometime since we have received any comments on the sightings and are anxious to see your opinion on same. When do you expect to leave for your summer vacation? I am clearing base on 31 July but will hope to see you or at least call you before I leave. Am going to Washington on Wednesday and Thursday this week on Press Release and new AF regulation for this Project and to tie up my projects in general.

Capt Ruppelt is due back today and am anxious to see him, and as I think I have told you, he will be part-timing this project until my replacement arrives.

Best regards,

Bob Olsson
