The following is an extract of a series of UFO sightings observed over various sections of Rome during the period 31 July-20 Sep 54. Reference ATIC 20104.

Austria - 9 Feb 54
Small, gleaming disc-like object, about twice as large as Venus. Observed for 2 minutes. ATIC Eval: Possible balloon.

Finland - 14 Sep 54
Circulating object over Helsinki at night. Flying at 800 meters (alt), it gave off an intense light and left a trail of reddish smoke. Visible for 7 sec. ATIC Eval: Possible meteorite. 

France - 30 Aug 54 - Paris
A Paris resident observed a luminous circular object flying over the city. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Somme Department - 1 Sep 54
0715 Lt Col G. and his assistant observed a "flying saucer" at Feuilleres. The object was circular, silvery-white and hovered at about 200 meters from the observers. The object oscillated slowly and seemed to have a closed door on its side. When the men had run about 50 meters toward it, the object began to fly away. Smoke was then visible from a sort of exhaust pipe on the underside. After an oblique flight of about 500 meters, the object rose vertically and disappeared. No sound of the object was found by police. The object did not glow and did not leave any trail. Visible for about 3 minutes. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN.

Aisne Department - 7 Sep 54
A luminous red orange disc observed by three persons. The disk stopped suddenly 300-400 meters from the ground. It seemed to have an upper side a small luminous tail coming out of the lower part of the object. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Italy - 14 Sep 54
Two inhabitants of Pitigliano report sighting of a round, white object making a strange loud noise. The object came to a stand still and then disappeared at high speed. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Rome - 17 Sep 54
On the afternoon of 17 Sep 54, the control tower at the Ciampino Air Base observed a mysterious object while a half a cigar flying slowly at an altitude of 1,200 meters. The object, leaving a trail of luminous smoke, was visible for 10 minutes. ATIC Eval: PROBABLE high altitude aircraft.

Netherlands - 4 Aug 54
Ten fireman observed two "flying saucers" over the Hague on the night of 4 August between 2200 and 2300 hours. They moved at incredible speed, at times remaining motionless for as long as 30 seconds. They were flat, from 10 to 15 meters in diameter, with a whitish gray light. ATIC EVAL: Possible searchlight beams.

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked increase in UFO sightings throughout Europe. ATIC attributes the majority of these sightings to two basic reasons:
1. The European press has been quick to publish, in detail, UFO sightings which has resulted in influencing a great number of persons for nighttime sightings.
2. Mr. D. Keyhoe's book was recently translated into various foreign languages and went on sale to newsstand throughout Europe during the summer of 1954.

The image contains an article from the New York Herald Tribune newspaper with the headline "Flying Cigar Startles Romans". The article discusses an incident where Romans reportedly observed a cigar-shaped object in the sky that was making fast movements. The article also mentions that the object was picked up on various instruments. There does not appear to be any photographs included in this particular document.

NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE.
the pipe line is that if oil could ever discovered in largge quantities in Libya, it would go far toward meeting the West's need for transporting refined products to the coast. Building the pipe line is part of the plan to link the oil fields of Libya with the Mediterranean.
It was Germany which during World War II as part of its effort to divert Allied supplies to the United Nations, sought to capture Tripoli and Benghazi.
"Flying Cigar" Startles Romans
ROME, Sept. 16 (/P). -Romans reported that some mysterious object described as a "flying cigar" was sighted in the sky here for about 40 minutes this afternoon. 
People in several parts of the city said they saw the object moving at great speed, and on unusual course. Some reported picking it up on scientific instruments. It was said to have appeared and disappeared several times during the period it was observed.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

"No Case (Information Only)
Source: CRIFO Newsletter 1 Oct 1954

ROME, ITALY

C-23. Rome, Italy ... 9/16/54) A. P. Wire: Startled Romans who saw a strange sugar-coated substance descending over the capital flooded newspaper offices with calls. Radar operators also reported picking up the missile in instruments. Technicians at Ciampino Airport described the "half-cigar" as plummeting toward earth for more than 1000 ft., then rising at tremendous speed before vanishing. (Thinks to George Gordon, Dayton, Ohio.)

An INS release by eyewitness Michael Chinigo states: "What attracted my attention was the strange sound it made. It was like thunder with a static effect... I saw a series of explosions that grew louder as the object got closer. This was followed by a loud whistling sound as the thing stopped just over the trees and left an exhausted trail of milky white smoke. It went straight up into the sky." The Defense Department described it as "a brilliant cone" with a smaller surface on the bottom, or as two semi-circular disks, one bigger than the other, with a bigger one on top. To the Italians it appeared "like an enormous lighted object with three lights or ports on the side." The radar station at Rome which picked up the "cigar" or "cone" said it registered for 3" minutes."

Editor's Note: Significant here is the AP and INS release. First they break as the news on the "labrador sighting in July, then silence, then the Norwegian space man story in August, now Italy. Foreign sightings all -- a subtle preparation.
