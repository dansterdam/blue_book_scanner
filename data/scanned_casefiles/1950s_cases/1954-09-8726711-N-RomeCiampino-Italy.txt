The following is an extract of a series of UFO sightings observed over various sections of Europe during the period 31 July-20 Sep 54.
Reference ATIC 201047, [redacted], dated 29 Oct 54.

Austria - 19 Aug 54
Small, gleaming disc-like object, about twice as large as Venus. Observed for 2 minutes. ATIC Eval: Possible Balloon.

Finland - 14 Sep 54
Circular flying object over Helsinki at night. Flying at 800 meters (alt), it gave off an intense light and left trail of reddish smoke. Visible for 7 sec. ATIC Eval: Possible meteorite.

France - 30 Aug 54 - Paris
A Paris resident observed a luminous circular object flying over the city. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Somme Department - 7 Sep 54
A 27 year old mason and his assistant observed a "flying saucer" at 0715 hrs, 7 Sep 54. The object was grey and was observed hovering over a field about 200 meters from the observers. The object oscillated slowly and seemed to have a closed door on its side. When the men had run about 50 meters toward it, the object began to fly away. Smoke was then visible from a sort of exhaust pipe on the underside. After an oblique flight of about 15 meters, the object rose vertically and disappeared. No trace of the object was found by police. The object was about 10 meters in diameter and 3 meters in height, did not glow and departed noiselessly, trailing smoke. Visible for about 3 minutes. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN

Aisne Department - 7 Sep 54
A luminous red orange disc observed by three persons. The disk stopped suddenly, 300-400 meters from the ground. It seemed to have on its upper side a small luminous tail forming an integral part of the object. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Italy - 14 Sep 54
Two inhabitants of Pitigliano report sighting of a round, white object making a strange, loud noise. The object came to a stand still and then disappeared at high speed. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data

Rome - 17 Sep 54
On the afternoon of 17 Sep 54, the control tower at the Ciampino Air Base observed a mysterious object, shaped like a half a cigar flying slowly at an altitude of 1,200 meters. The object, leaving a trail of luminous smoke, was visible for 40 minutes. ATIC Eval: Probable high altitude a/c.

Netherlands - 4 Aug 54

Ten firemen observed two "flying saucers" over the Hague on the night of 4 August between 2300 and 2400 hours. They moved at incredible speed, at times remaining motionless for as long as 30 seconds. They were flat ovals with a whitish gray light. ATIC Eval: Possible searchlight beams.

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked increase in UFO sightings throughout Europe. ATIC attributes the majority of these sightings to two basic reasons:

1. The European press has been quick to publish, in detail, UFO sightings which has resulted in influencing a great number of persons for personal publicity.

2. Mr. D. Keyhoe's book was recently translated into various foreign languages and went on sale at newsstands throughout Europe during the summer of 1954.

NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE.

[Partial text, some words are cut off or illegible]

the pipe line is that if oil is
ever discovered in large quan-
tities in Interior Alaska it would
be possible. After some read-
justment, it is believed, facili-
ties could be made for
transporting such products to
the coast.

This is not the first pipe line
to be built from the coast to
the Alaskan Interior. A three-
inch line has been from
Fairbanks via Whitehorse
during World War II as part
the Coast-project is still in
partial operation.

Flying Cigar
Startles Romans

ROME, Sept. 16 (AP) - Started
from a strange while
clear-shaped object streaking
over the city's capitol. It might
have been a guided missile, but
anxious calls. Radar operations
also reported picking up the ob-
ject on their instruments.

Field outside Rome described it
as having a "flying cigar" which
at one instant dropped to
ward the earth for more than
1,000 feet, then rose at tremend-
ous speed and finally vanished
moving northwest.

C-23, Rome, Italy ... 9/16/54) A. P. Wire: Startled Romans who saw a strange cigar-shaped object streaking over the capital flooded newspaper offices with calls. Radar operators also reported picking up the missile on instruments. Technicians at Ciampino Airfield described the "half-cigar" as plummeting toward earth for more than 1000 ft., then rising at tremendous speed before vanishing. ( Thanks to George Popovich, Barberton, Ohio. )

An INS release by eyewitness Michael Chinigo states: "What attracted my attention was the strange sound as it passed overhead. It was like thunder with a staccato effect ... a series of explosions that grew louder as the object got closer. This was followed by a dead silence as the thing stopped, or appeared to, at a height of about 6000 ft. Suddenly it shot upward and left an exhaust trail of milky white smoke. It went straight up into the sky. The Defense Dept. described it as a 'clipped cone' with a smaller surface on the bottom, or as two semi-circular disks, one bigger than the other, with a bigger one on top. To me it seemed like an inverted sawed-off cone. What was strange was the object's ability to 'park' in mid-air for several minutes. The radar station at Rome which picked up the 'cigar' or 'cone' said it registered for 36 minutes."
( Thanks to Warren Morse, Palo Alto, Calif. )

Editor's Note: Significant here is the AP and INS release. First they break us the news on the Labrador sighting in July, then silence, then the Norwegian space man in August, now Italy. Foreign sightings all -- a subtle preparation.
