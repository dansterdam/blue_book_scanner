Following is an extract from SDO 1/Lt Robert R McKay, Jr report of 1 December 57, for your information and necessary action:

"1130 - Received call from Base Patrolman Burns regarding inquiry by Ohio State Police for a Mr [redacted] of Tiffin, Ohio. [redacted] has object that "UFO" was to pick up as the result of a call to ATIC on 22 Nov 57. Called Capt Gregory. Called 7/Sgt Bolles. As result of those telcons I called Patrolman Burns and asked that info be returned to Lutz that someone will contact him ASAP."

"1520 - Received UFO Report from Sqdn Leader Walker (text attached) and monitored by USAF Command Post (Maj Burns). Early Bird."

Several UFO inquiries started coming in from around Dayton. Deputy Sheriff Whalen, Montgomery County, had five cars chasing a UFO South on Highway, 25, between Germantown and Middletown. We knew of nothing. Several aircraft were reported in the area.

NAL HERALD
Downtown Tomorrow: An Even Greater Dayton
DAYTON, OHIO, MONDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1957 Entered as Second-Class Matter 36 F

Venus---So Bright---Causing Quite A Stir
VENUS, THE EVENING STAR, last night caused a flurry of telephone calls to the sheriff's office and The Journal Herald, because of its unusual brilliance. A 30-minute photograph captured the plane (left), compared with Venus (right) revealed the comparative sizes of the two bodies. Venus was well above the horizon from about 7:30 p.m. last night (at right) roved the constellation Cetus, moving toward the western horizon. (Staff) photo by George Adams

MEMO ROUTING SLIP

NEVER USE FOR APPROVALS, DISAPPROVALS, CONCURRENCES OR SIMILAR ACTIONS

[Top portion of routing slip with mostly blank fields]

REMARKS:
1. Request review of attached O.D.s right. There has been no answer so far.

2. For the last two weeks I am continually called by the SDO and have been of the night until 4:05 AM.

3. In this instance - 23 calls.

4. Believe I should integrate "in the shot stuff" now we are going for A.C.N.

(For all practical purposes - UFO style)
