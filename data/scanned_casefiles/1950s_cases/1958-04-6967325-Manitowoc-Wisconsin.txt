3. Aside from the obligation imposed upon the Air Force to resolve the sighting as prescribed by para 1, AFR 200-2, the unquestioned reliability and integrity of the observers involved in this incident could be exploited, to the adverse interests of the Air Force, by UFO clubs and "flying saucer" proponents, if brought to the attention of the general public. This is particularly true if it is shown that no further action was taken or found inconclusive on the part of the Air Force.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Sister[redacted]

I was called at 10:30 P.M. April 12, 1958 at which time I saw two objects located in the West. The white object seemed to be going back and forth, uncertain whether on ground or not. It had the appearance of a bright ball of light. There seemed to be a protrusion which gave it sort of a cone shape and also an outline of red.

Object was seen at intervals. The red object was very small, couldn't tell what shape. It fell in a very uneven and slow manner. It wasn't a bright light. I left in about a half hour at which time the objects were still in view. I used binoculars to view it part time.

Sister[redacted]

We were informed on radio that Sputnik II would land that night but didn't know where. Out of curiosity I watched to see if I could see it again as I had seen it about 3 or 4 times. About 5:30 I began to look at the West Southwest direction from where it usually came. The first time I didn't see anything but between 5:30 and 9:00, I saw an object that was coming that looked like a star and it seemed to disappear. But in the meantime, I saw this other object in the West and I watched and it seemed to drop gradually from the sky. I watched it for about 10 minutes and it kept on dropping. I called another Sister out and asked her if she could see it. At first she didn't see it but eventually she saw it. As we watched it seemed to hover 4 over the ground but not touch it.

It seemed to be about 5 feet from the ground. Then it would flare up to rather a bright light and then it would move around back and forth past one spot but still the light was very bright. In the meantime, Sister left to get the binoculars and just as she left the object flared up and seemed like it was going to explode, different colors of light came from it. There were different shades of light, orange, blue, etc. It looked like it was going to burst into flame. By the time Sister came back it had gone back to a white light. We observed through binoculars.

Sister (cont)

and we saw a second object coming down from the sky, which is number 2 in my questionnaire.

It seemed to drop in jerks into the trees. It was circular shaped similar to a large grapefruit, colored red. It seemed to hover in one position. After Sister left I noticed the object (No. 1) started to move in a Northeast direction. I shifted position from the West to Northeast part of the building and as I watched from the second position I noticed that both objects were going in a Northeasterly direction No. 1 leading and No. 2 following about an angle of 90° toward NE horizon. No. 1 kept rising until it disappeared in a more northerly direction. No. 2, after it had gone quite a distance in a NE direction, turned and come back and seemed to bounce over houses and seemed to be about a 90° angle. It headed in a Northwest direction, then it turned Southwest. It kept bouncing over the field. It kept on until after midnight when I left. Later the sheriff came and asked me to show him where I the objects. He I showed him the exact spot. I also used the binoculars and saw object No. 2. He couldn't tell what it was and went toward it to find out what it was. It disappeared when he got close to where it was.

From: Commander Manitowoc Sqdn C.A.P.

Subject: Vital Intelligence Report

1....At 12:45 A.M. 12 April 1958, I was called by the Manitowoc County Sheriff's Dept and the County Director of Civil Defense to assist in the investigation of reported UFO's.

2....At 11:30 Saturday night, a Nun from the Holy Family Convent on the outskirts of Manitowoc reported two blue lights flying around the convent and reported that one had landed and was then visible in a nearby field.

3....The Sheriff of Manitowoc County took two patrol cars to the scene and personally saw the one light on the ground from an observation point within the Convent. Upon searching the field, however, the object had disappeared. The second object had previously flown off on a heading of 350 deg. at a high rate of speed.

4....A search that lasted until about 3 A.M., in which I personally took part failed to turn up any new information.

5....At 10 A.M. Sunday, I took my Executive Officer out to the convent and interviewed the two Nuns who made the sightings.

6....Enclosed with this letter is a CIRVIS report and a transcript of a tape recording we made. We are holding the original tape at our HQ should your command desire to make use of it.

Here is the text from the document:

C- Commander Basset. 
S- Sister

C- Sister, Now what is your name?
S- Sister

C- Sister, last night did you call the Traffic Bureau, the Sheriff's office?
S- I called the operator first and she called the other office.

C- You reported seeing mysterious lights, is that right?
S- That is right.

C- How many did you see?
S- The first was the large one. I don't know how large, but quite large and it would flare up.

C- One or two?
S- The first one was near the ground and quite large.

C- But you saw two.
S- yes.

C- What were the shape of these lights?
C- Circular?
S- Like a ball.

C- Would you say like a disc?
C- You put your hand outstraight, how big would it appear to be? Would it be like the size of a pin?
S- Bigger

C- Size of a pea?
C- Bigger

C- How about a dime?
S- Bigger

C- A Nickel?
S- Bigger

C- Half a dollar?
S- Larger

C- Dollar?
S- Larger Grapefruit.

C- Basketball?
S- More like a basketball.

C- Size of a basketball. What Color did it have?
S- Part of the time it was a clear light and it reflected light. The larger one, and then it looked like a star.

C- We're talking about the big one now.
G- Yes

C- A white light?
S- Sorta white and it turned different colors.

C- Any other colors?
S- All over and red.

C- First you saw it, it was white and then what color, sister?
C- It flared and turned different colors after it flared.
S- From white to orange and blue and red?
C- That is right.

C- Did you see both of them at the same time?
S- Yes I did

C- Were they in any particular formation, were they side by side, one above the other?
S- One was above the other.

C- Now back to question one. How big would you say that was?
S- I would say at first about the size of a baseball.
C- About the size of a baseball.
S- Then it was higher up.


- page 29 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

C- Could you see any features of it?
S- No, the smaller one was up higher. As it came down it was a dim white light.

C- Could you see any portholes?
S- No.

C- Any windows?
S- No from when I was.

C- No rotating light on it?
S- No, it seemed to tumble.

C- Was there a tall on it like a tail or a comet?
C- Not that I could see.

C- Did it leave a trail of sparks at any time?
S- At times it flared up and then sparks seemed to come from different directions.

C- Did it seem to have any exhaust like that of a jet airplane?
C- I didn't notice anything. It seemed to come down slowly behind the cluster of trees over there. I watched as it came down. You could see how near it was to the ground, but it didn't seem to touch the ground.

C- Did you hear any sounds?
S- I couldn't. I am hard of hearing.

C- In what direction did these objects appear from you?
S- West-South west.

C- Did you see them coming up from south-west?
S- When I saw it first, it was behind the church, about a mile beyond coming from south-west.

C- Coming from south-west apparently heading North-west.
S- That is right.

C- What first called your attention to these objects, Sister?
S- Well, I usually watch the stars since this scientific program is on.
   Then a radio announcement came on. One of the Sisters heard it and informed me about it. The radio announcer made a statement it would come down last night or early this morning.

C- You were looking for Sputnik?
S- That is correct. I have seen it a number of times.

C- Oh you have.
S- Sister Clotina was here for a lecture telling us all about it.

C- How high above the horizon would you say it was?
S- When I first saw it?
C- Yes.
S- I'm not a good judge of distance. I would say --
C- Over the tree tops?
S- The were higher than the trees.

C- Would you say 100 ft?
S- I would say higher.

C- 200 ft. Sister?
S- About that. I would think. It could be higher too.

C- When you first noticed them, were there 2 of them, two together?
S- They were pretty close together. Just about the same line.
   In about the same line and about equal distance apart and about 50 ft.

C- You say one dropped down in this field apparently?
S- It seemed to be about a mile out in the highway 151. As the light became brighter I could see it. It looked like it was at the other end of our field.

C- This field out here?
S- That is right.


- page 30 -

Here is the text from the document:

C- The other one took off and went north, is that right?
S- Not right away.
C- A little later?
S- Oh yes, quite awhile later.
C- How long did you see these objects?
S- Seemed to be over the field about an hour.
C- About an hour?
S- Yes.
C- Seemed to hover in one spot?
S- It seemed to. It seemed to raise up and move in different directions and flare up.
C- Sort of pulsating. Brighter, dimmer, brighter, dimmer.
C- That is right.
C- Did you notice any color change when it moved?
S- Yes, it got brighter.
C- It got brighter when it accelerated.
C- That is right.
C- You saw it through your glasses you are wearing now, visually?
S- Yes, and then later we looked through binoculars from the laboratory.
C- What time was it when you first saw it?
S- It was about 8 o'clock. No, it was about 8:30.
C- About 8:30. You called the Sheriff's Dept. about 11:30
S- That is when I was flaring up quite a bit.
C- They were still here from 8:30 to 11:30
S- Not the larger one. The larger one had moved toward north down the Alverno Road about 100 ft. in the air.
C- What would you say weather conditions were last night?
S- I wasn't out but I think they were good. The sky was clear and you could see other stars. It took off from the ground and headed North-east and the smaller one came down and followed. The larger one seemed to go down Alverno Road, the smaller one went more directly East and it circled and by the time I got to the West window again it was across the field and headed towards the woods and it was low and it would flare up like a white light.
C- Like a white light. Then at 8:30 you saw it and you called the police
S- at 11:30.
C- After we had been watching it a while.
C- O.K. Sister, Thank you very much.

Here is the text from the document:

C- Commander Bissett
C- Sgt. 2

C- And your name Sister?
C- Sister.
C- Sister, last night about 1130 the Sheriff's office received a call from the county sheriff here that was a thundered object, some bright object around this vicinity. Did you see either one object?
C- Last night about 1130 I was called by Sister _____ and I came over and it kept going on and off and there was also something more that was right above this and as it came down and it got smaller. Rather a while it didn't, was driving. The object on the ground kept getting brighter and then it would go off.

C- Sister, what shape were the objects?
C- I would say round.
C- Like a ball?
C- Yes.
C- Now if you put your arm out and sight the object off the tip of your fingers about what size would you say? As big as a head of a pin?
C- The thing that was in the sky wasn't big at all.
C- Would it look like the sky or a pinhead?
C- Bigger than that.
C- How about the size of a pea?
C- As it kept coming down it got smaller.
C- Would you say the size of a dime?
C- Yes.
C- About the size of a 10¢ piece at arm's length. That was one of them. Was the other one bigger?
C- The ball on the ground that was big.
C- How big would you say that was? What did it look like?
C- To me it was ----
C- Like a grapefruit?
C- No, was bigger.
C- Possibly?
C- No bigger.
C- Significantly?
C- Yes.
C- Size of a basketball. What was the color Sister?
C- The ball out the ground was white. Then was white and the object in the air was red. It looked like fire.
C- And you saw 2 of them. Were they flying in any particular formation.
C- From what I can remember, the object on the ground kept moving back and forth. It seemed to roll. The red object seemed to be right above it and to keep coming down.
C- Could you see any details? Did it have any particular shape outside of being somewhat hazy?
C- The one on the ground I looked at through a pair of binoculars. They weren't very strong, but it seemed to have a red tinge to it, but otherwise I could.
C- Could you see any windows, portholes?
C- No.
C- Did it have any tail on it like a comet's tail?
C- The one on the ground had some kind of rotation to it.
C- Did it leave any marks?
C- To you, as far as it would go outside.
C- Could you hear any sounds?

Here is the text from the document:

[The document appears to be a transcript of an interview or statement, with questions and answers. Some names and specific details are redacted with black marks. The conversation seems to be about an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting, with one person (referred to as "Sister") describing what they saw in the sky. The text includes detailed questions about the object's movement, color, and visibility. The conversation is structured as a back-and-forth dialogue, with one party asking specific questions about the sighting and the other responding.]

The text is fully legible, but due to its length, I've provided a summary. If you would like the full verbatim text, I can provide that as well.
