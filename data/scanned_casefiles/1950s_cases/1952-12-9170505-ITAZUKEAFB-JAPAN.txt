Date of Incid: 18 Dec 52    Location: Northern Kyushu

A radar target was picked up on this date by the 567th AC&W Group in Northern Kyushu. Description of the target: target size approximately that made by B-29 type aircraft. There is no evidence of target trace or trail. Target was tracked for a period of 9 minutes and appeared to be going 300 knots on initial pickup and estimated 100 knots on the last pickup.

Air traffic present at the time of sighting consisted of five other targets which were identified as USAF aircraft.    This sighting is an unknown.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: I/O 527th AC&W Gp APO 929     IR-6-52     PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

1. Description of Target: Target size approximately that one by B-29 type aircraft. Target was no cylinder of trail. Target was tracked for a period of 9 minutes, with five plots registering over this period. Succeeding tracks indicated an increase in speed ranging from 300 knots on initial pickup to an estimated 1040 knots at 6th picture.

The following information identified as track #6 was forwarded this headquarters:

RANGE   AZIMUTH   GEOGREF COG.D     TIME        EST SPEED
185     223       WJID 4915         06281       ---
190     225       WJID 3514         06301       300

230     277       WJID 5062         06301       1040

2. Scientific Data: Object was detected at 06281 and remained on scope for 9 minutes.

3. Manner of Observation: Radar Scope presentation (AN/TPS-5).

4. Location of Observer: WJPF 1432.

5. Identifying Information: A/3c [redacted] reliability and proficiency have been rated high by the detachment commander.

6. Weather: Weather along track area variable, cloud coverage 5/10 to 7/10, base 4000 ± 500 feet, wind 000, temp 1 strong subsidence inversion at 6000 feet temperature at 6 degrees centigrade.

7. Other activity that might account for sighting: None.

8. Physical Evidence: None.

9. Interception: None attempted.

10. Air Traffic: There were a total of five other targets visible at time of sighting each one being in the WLRF system.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICE: In view of existing atmospheric conditions it is believed that reflection of radar waves was possibly being accounted for unusual phenomenon and speed.

D/I FEAP COMMENT:

1. Contact has not been confirmed as a bone-fide target.

2. Refraction through the strong inversion at 6000 feet, combined with time errors in plotting of a normal friendly aircraft return may account for the unusual episode reported.

STATEMENT

At 0600 hrs item time 16 December 1952, I was assigned to report target on the PFT console in radar observations. The scope I was reading covers the range from one hundred miles to two hundred and thirty miles. At 0626 hrs item, an initial track appeared at 230 degrees at 165 miles. I called this to the plotting board.

At 0630 hrs item, this track was traveling comparatively fast. After the second move he seemed to increase speed and after his third move I turned the markers of to make sure that he was actually moving as fast as he seemed to be. I brought this to the attention of A/2c Jamy P. McCoy who is my crew chief. Then this target left my scope. I estimated his speed and no weather on my scope and no other presentation that would impair the accuracy of my reading the scope. This target appeared as an ordinary aircraft. It would appear if it were a B-29 or other large type aircraft.
