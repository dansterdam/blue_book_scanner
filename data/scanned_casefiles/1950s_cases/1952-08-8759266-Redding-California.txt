Mrs. told me that she didn't make a report in the first one that passed. It was seen by her first, since I was going south. It went over some twenty minutes before the others. The watchball it and wondered about it, but did not report it. Then at 5:45 we saw the second one. The rest came at intervals and all appeared in the same place and disappeared at almost the same place. They all followed the same course in my opinion.
