30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

In regards to question 20, these objects were merely flights.
I have not the slightest idea how high they were, so I cannot
estimate their speed. However, the hills to the North-East are
between 2000 and 3000 feet, and assuming the objects were at
an altitude equal to the hills, my speed estimate for them
would be 1200 to 1500 miles per hour.

These flights were definitely not:
1. Meteors
2. Balloons
3. Jet aircraft
4. A hallucination

5. Reflections from the city
(there was no surface to reflect.)

I have a commercial pilot's license with instrument card and
Traffic-Engine Rating. My license number is [blacked out].
I have seen many meteors and jet aircraft. These flights
were neither. My home is situated on the [blacked out]
Alameda Naval Air Station, and I can assure you I am
familiar with seeing them over my shore at all hours,
mainly at 0300 at about 400 ft. They made enough
noise to tip off the craft, and these flights (which I first
assumed to be navigational flights) were soundless.
