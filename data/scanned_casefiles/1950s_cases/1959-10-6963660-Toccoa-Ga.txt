This INCIDENT
TOOK PLACE
26 OCT 59

Ice Falls From Sky???
TOCCOA, Ga.—A Georgia
farmer said today he saw something
clothed by a strange, 50-yard
chunk of ice that whooshed out
of a clear sky and hit in his
pasture.

It was no more than 12 feet
away when it hit, and it almost
swept him to death, the farmer
said.

Pieces of it scattered—as it
crushed into the ground and
tore through a foot of topsoil.
Chunks who analyzed the
muddy-colored water said it was
pure, soft and untreated, the
chlorinated water such as rain.

He was not manufacturing ice,
they said. The muddy color was
attributed to particles of red clay
picked up when it dug a crater
through the garden soil.

Hopehs Area: the village of
Avalon, Habersham County, is
near the spot where the sky fell
Area the sky there on Monday.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD                                                5 Jan 60

SUBJECT:  Pieces of Ice Falling From Out of Sky

1. On 30 December 1959, AFCIN-4F3c informed 4732 that information had been received to the effect that large pieces of ice of unexplained origin had fallen to Earth in Georgia. Clippings from a newspaper were submitted in which mention was made of analysis work being performed on the ice by the Army Ice Snow and Permafrost Research Laboratory in Wilmette, Illinois. AFCIN-4F3c was requested to obtain further information on the subject.

2. A long distance call was placed to the Army Laboratory mentioned above and it was established that the analysis of the ice was being performed nearby, at Evanston, Illinois.

3. It was possible to talk to Dr. [redacted] at the Evanston facility, telephone number [redacted], 24. He indicated that they had only received a small piece of ice, measuring about 1' by 2". The analysis indicated that it was artificial ice, rather dirty, in other words not of natural origin. The characteristic crystallic of melt was completely absent. Dr. [redacted] gave as an example of origin as detaching itself from an airplane. He further mentioned that a similar event had taken place about two years ago in New Jersey, in that at that time the Physical Sciences Division of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pa. had performed the ice analysis. Finally, he indicated that an analysis of the water resulting from the melting of ice is being performed by some agency unknown to him.

4. Dr. [redacted] promised to send 4F3d a copy of his report on the present incident and will attach the name of the organization performing the water analysis and any further information available to him in the subject. He expected a delay of about two weeks before being able to send the report.

AFCIN-4F3d:

Dr [redacted] - Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D. C.

Smithsonian not conducting analysis - Analysis being conducted by Bureau of Standards (Dr [redacted]) - University of Chicago - Army Engineers, Ft Belvoir, Va.

Bureau of Standards official report due soon - Off the record Dr. [redacted] said that sample appeared to be coastal water, probably object fell from aircraft known to be in area at the time.

The [redacted], Reading, Pa. have analyzed six similar cases and in each case determined the ice to be from aircraft.

Ice ranged in weight from 25 to 100 lbs.

Dr [redacted] pointed out that the press has hounded the Smithsonian for information concerning the ice and indicated that they felt something was withheld.

UPI AC3

ATLANTA, JUNE 25 (UPI)--IT TOOK EIGHT MONTHS AND A MASSIVE
AMOUNT OF STUDY, BUT SCIENTISTS FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHERE THE
BIG ICE CUBE THAT FRIGHTENED A GEORGIA FARMER CAME FROM.
IT WAS JUST FROZEN DRINKING WATER FROM A JET AIRPLANE.
A 40-POUND CHUNK OF ICE PLUMMETED FROM THE SKY LAST OCTOBER AND
FELL ON THE FARM OF O. J. LECROY NEAR TOCCOA, GA. SCIENTISTS
AND ORDINARY CITIZENS FROM ALL OVER ADVANCED DOZENS OF THEORIES
ABOUT ITS ORIGINS.
REP. JAMES DAVIS (D-GA.) RELEASED A REPORT FROM THREE GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES YESTERDAY ANNOUNCING THAT THE ICE WAS FORMED WHEN DRINKING
WATER LEAKED FROM A COMMERCIAL DC-6 JET PLANE FLYING AT 35,000 FEET,
THE WATER FROZE OUTSIDE THE PLANE AND THEN DROPPED WHEN THE PLANE
DESCENDED.
THE REPORT BY THE U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF
STANDARDS AND THE U.S. WEATHER BUREAU INCLUDED 40 PAGES OF
FINDINGS IN ADDITION TO DIAGRAMS AND PICTURES.
