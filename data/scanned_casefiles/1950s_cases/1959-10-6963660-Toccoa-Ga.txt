The card contains various fields such as the date, location, type of observation, source, number of objects observed, and a brief summary of the sighting. The summary indicates that a large, square, 50-pound block of ice fell out of the sky, making a loud whistly rustling of air. The conclusions section of the card is filled out, indicating that the object was possibly a balloon.

THIS INCIDENT
TOOX PLACE
26 OCT 3-9

"See Fell from Sky" 
to Cal-Georgia Co., Carter
This report is based on inior-
nation secured from sources
which show that on Monday 
night, October 26, at about
9:45 pm, a strange object was
observed to fall from the sky
and strike the ground near
Toccoa, Ga., a few miles north
of the Georgia-South Carolina
line. The object was described
as being a ball of fire and
streaks were seen behind it
as it fell. The object struck
the ground with an explosive
impact about two miles north
of Toccoa, Ga. and the sound
of the explosion was heard for
many miles around.
Search parties were organized
immediately and went to the
scene. They found a crater
about 40 feet in diameter and
four feet deep, in which there
was a quantity of molten metal
and what appeared to be some
pieces of glass or other material.
The crater was cordoned off
and a guard placed around it 
to prevent anyone from aproaching
it or tampering with the evidence.
A quantity of the material from 
the crater was collected and taken
away for analysis. It is said that
the material was found to be
composed of an unknown substance.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
5 Jan 60

SUBJECT: Pieces of Ice Falling From Out of Sky

1. On 30 December 1959, AFCIN-4P3C informed 4P3D that information had been received from a reliable source that a large mass of ice had fallen to Earth in Georgia. Clippings from a newspaper were submitted in which sightings of this mass of ice were made and analysis was performed on the ice by the Army Snow and Permafrost Research Laboratory in Wilmette, Illinois. AFCIN-4P3D was requested to obtain further information on the subject.

2. A long distance call was placed to the Army Laboratory mentioned above and it was established that the analysis of the ice was being performed nearby, at Evanston, Illinois.

3. It was possible to talk to Dr. [NAME REDACTED] at the Evanston facility, telephone number [NUMBER REDACTED]. He indicated that they had only received a small piece of ice, measuring about 18 by 6 inch. The analysis indicated that it was artificial ice rather dirty, in other words, not of natural origin. The characteristic crystalline structure was emplastic, indicating it was different than the kind of ice one normally expects from a natural source. Dr. [NAME REDACTED] gave as an example of origin as distinguishing itself from an airplane. He further mentioned that a similar incident had taken place some years ago in New Jersey, in that at that time the Physical Science Division of the Franklin Institute had performed the ice analysis. Finally, he indicated that an analysis of the water resulting from the melting of ice is being performed by agency unknown to him.

4. Dr. [NAME REDACTED] promised to send 4P3D a copy of his report on the present incident and will attach the name of the organization performing the water analysis and any further information available to him on the subject. He expected a delay of about two weeks before being able to send the report.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report, likely related to Project Blue Book, that discusses an analysis of samples of ice that were found. The text describes the samples as ranging from 25 to 100 lbs in weight and mentions that the Smithsonian Institute was contacted for information regarding the ice. It also notes that the press had inquired about the ice samples.

Dr. - Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C.
Smithsonian not conducting analysis - Analysis being conducted by Bureau of Standards (Dr. - )
Bureau of Standards official report due soon - off the record
Dr. - said that sample appeared to be coastal water, probably objects fell from aircraft known to be in area at the time.
The Bureau of Standards have analyzed six similar cases and in each case determined the ice to be from aircraft.
Ice ranged in weight from 25 to 100 lbs.
Dr. - pointed out that the press has hounded the Smithsonian for information concerning the ice and indicated that they fell something was being withheld.
