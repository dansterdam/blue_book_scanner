II. RELIABILITY: Source was a mature, conscientious individual who had an open mind concerning this subject. He was receptive to all suggestions as to the possible identification of objects but was firmly convinced he could not make positive identification.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was on duty in control tower at Lincoln AFB, Nebr. was watching surface, when his attention was called to a red flashing light north of the tower by one of the controllers.

Object was observed with binoculars and it was ascertained that it was an air liner, which was confirmed by Kansas City Air Traffic Control Center. Shortly thereafter, source noticed another object in the NE quadrant and in the west thirty to forty seconds from now more objects were sighted.

Objects went end, flashing creating type, moving vertically at high speeds. Occasionally objects moved behind a hangar northwest of the tower.

Source stated the brightness of the objects was comparable to an automobile headlight at a distance of mile or less. Size of objects was that of a pea half an arm's length. One of the objects appeared to separate and go in opposite directions. Initial flight path was in a northwesterly direction.

Source estimated objects were thirty degrees from true north and ten degrees from the horizon when they appeared and forty degrees from true north, ten degrees from the horizon when they disappeared. Source estimated that he observed objects for about twenty five minutes.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was a quiet, reserved sort of individual and seemed somewhat confused when questions were asked. Before answering questions he had a tendency to want to discuss his answers with the other persons that had made the sighting.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was looking north while on duty in control tower when objects appeared. He was looking northeast when objects disappeared. They were observed for a period of thirty minutes.

Objects were reddish-white, seemingly transparent, flashing or rotating. Brightness was like that of an automobile headlight at a mile or more away and about the size of a pea held at arm's length.

Movement of objects was erratic, appearing to stand still and then suddenly speed up and rush away. One of the objects separated and moved off in opposite directions.

Source estimated objects were 39 degrees from true north and 30 degrees from the horizon when they first appeared and 45 degrees from true north and 30 degrees from the horizon when they disappeared. He estimated his distance from objects at 16,000 feet.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check was made with the weather station at Lincoln AFB, Nebr. and the wind readings at 2100 CST, 12 Feb 57 were:

Surface - calm
6,000' - 290 degrees at 30 knots
10,000' - 320 degrees at 45 knots
16,000' - 320 degrees at 60 knots
20,000' - 310 degrees at 80 knots
30,000' - 310 degrees at 90 knots
50,000' - 290 degrees at 70 knots

This station only releases ceiling balloons and then only when the situation dictates the need. The weather was clear on the day of sighting, therefore, no balloons were released.

It was also learned here, that balloons are released at Omaha and North Platte Nebr. every six hours, daily, beginning at 0300 CST. On this schedule, balloons would have been released at 2100 CST, 12 Feb 57.

2. Conversations with the Science Departments of Nebraska Wesleyan University and Doane College at main research information, this university had as an observatory-planetarium, however, they had observed nothing on the day of sighting. At both colleges, while they were engaged in research requiring the release of balloons.

One of the instructors in the Science Department also teaches at the University of Nebraska. It was learned from him that the University of Nebraska was not engaged in any research requiring the release of balloons or other devices.

3. CAA radio at Omaha, Nebr. was contacted and they reported no traffic in the Lincoln area at the time of sighting. They did report, however, that flying conditions at that time were VFR and only limited contact is maintained with aircraft under those conditions, and a possibility existed that there could have been aircraft in the area.

4. Through Flight Service at Lowry AFB, Colo., it was learned from United Air Lines at Stapleton Field, Denver, Colo., that three flights that could have been in the area at the time of sighting. They also stated that under VFR conditions, only limited contact is maintained with aircraft.

Comments of the Preparing Officer:

1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that these objects were probably commercial aircraft for the following reasons:

a. All Sources who visually observed objects stated that there was a resonance to flashing beacons used on commercial aircraft.

b. The statement made by United Air Lines that it was possible that three of their flights could have been in the area at the time of sighting.

c. The fact that objects were observed by radar indicates that the flashing lights were being carried by a vehicle capable of giving a radar return.

February 12, 1957. At 7:15 p.m. a New York Airways helicopter, approaching LaGuardia Airport, advised the tower that they had an object "shaped like a bell" with a red light in sight over the Aquacade of the old World's Fair site. The tower replied that about 15 minutes before they "had one out there ... with an expansive, wide light. It went up and down for a while. Some pilots saw it, others didn't."

POLICE OFFICER AND OTHERS WATCH MANEUVERING NIGHT LIGHTS
February 13, 1957: The information in this case was obtained directly from the observer by 1st. CSI member, California, who reported the details to CSI member who in turn forwarded the information to us.

Officer of the Burbank, California Police Force, was dispatched at 6:30 p.m. to investigate a report of an object seen over Lockheed property in the San Fernando Valley. Arriving at 6:15, he was told to look up toward Mars (then 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon) where he saw a white star-like light. As he watched, the "star" moved slightly; in a few seconds later, it moved abruptly, at a high rate of speed toward his right. In motion, the light blinked and showed, alternately, a red and green light which appeared to be superimposed on the white light. It reversed its course, sweeping back toward the area from which it had come. As it was turning, another and larger bright white light appeared to the left of the first one, and seemed to be on a collision course with the second light mentioned. Following this, both objects again turned so that they were heading away from each other. Finally Officer could watch only one at a time; turning from the first, which then heading northwest over the city, he found the second light had disappeared, looking back toward the first, he found it had also vanished.

Both lights had been too far above the horizon - 60 to 70 degrees - to have been satellites or aircraft. The display lasted about 15 minutes. - Besides the information contained in Mr. letters to Mr., other details were gleaned from the L. A. Times, and the L. A. Mirror-News, 2/14.

February 16, 1957. A spectacularly brilliant blue-green fireball exploded over the vicinity of Brunswick, Maine at a time variously given as between 4:35 and 4:42 a.m. The light was seen over sections of three states, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, and was described by most observers as lighting up the sky "as bright as day." (Certainly this was not identifiable with the non-exploding fireball-like objects described elsewhere in this issue.) - Boston Globe, 2/17, etc.

February 16, 1957. Another fireball-type UFO (or actual fireball) was seen by a White Plains policeman and his wife. They were driving east of White Plains at about 7 p.m. when they saw a brilliant object to the east of them, bluish-green with a whitish cast, in size comparable to a full moon. It was first seen on a compass bearing of about 45° (N.E.) and moved rapidly in a precise horizontal trajectory to the south, at a constant elevation of about 15°. In turning away to concentrate on the road, the driver of the car reported he last saw it on a compass bearing of 110° (E.S.E.); his wife watched it disappear behind buildings farther to their right. There was an impression of a tail, but the speed was so great that the witnesses felt the tail might be illusory. It was viewed for three seconds by one witness and slightly longer by the other.

Again we request any additional information that might be supplied by readers.

No Case (Information Only)                                    20 February 1957
                                                                        Westchester County, PA.

February 20, 1957. Two F-86's were sent aloft to investigate a translucent, oddly shaped object hovering motionless over Westchester County Airport around noon. The information comes from a CSI member (who asks that his name be withheld), who was at the airport when the alert was sounded. In the office, he heard the "squawk-box" saying, "... hold your positions ... hold your positions." A DC-6 was just completing a landing, and at the far end of the field two F-86's were readying for take-off. The observer went out to watch them and saw their objective floating in the sky south of the field, at about 600 elevation.

It was a top-sided square object, translucent white, and the observer reported a point-like projection on the left side of the object (see diagram). The object was similar to a square-based pyramid on its side; the size was that of a full moon. It did not move. As the two jets headed toward the object, the witness went to his car, hoping to get home in time to get his camera and take photographs. Driving away, he saw the jets making a 360° turn around the object. This was the last he saw of the objects, for at 16 had vanished when he reached home 20 minutes later; he did see one jet getting ready to land at the airport - possibly one of the two that had been scrambled earlier.

The observer felt that this object might possibly have been a partially deflated weather balloon, although he was definite that he did not see the object drifting with the wind, or floating to the earth. The day was very clear and quite cold, the observer himself did not notice any wind.

February 21, 1957.  On this occasion it was seen from 9:35 to 10:15 p.m. This time
it was hovering motionless at first; a few minutes later it began to rock back
and forth like a pendulum again, and following this, the two pairs of smaller
red objects were again launched upward.  About 10 minutes afterward, the object
rose and disappeared, seeming to be "turned off."

The reported incidents were investigated by Bill Blades and John Burton of
White Plains.  Although the repetitive nature of the phenomenon is perplexing,
Blades, who is an amateur astronomer, has carefully checked the data for possible
astronomical misidentifications, but cannot identify it with any star or planet.

II. SUMMARY: Objects were visually observed by three control operators and by the Director of Operations of the 98th Bomb Wing, who was in the tower supervising a wing mission. Objects were also observed on radar by the HCGIC of GCA Operations. Opinions varied from three to six as to the number of objects seen. All observations were made at Lincoln AFB, Nebr. (GBORR FUEL 1352). Objects were of the red flashing or rotating type. Objects were reported as having been seen at 130730Z Feb 57, however, interviews revealed objects were also sighted at approximately 110330Z Feb 57. Follow-up investigation consisted of personal interview with all observers except Col Robert B. Nowell, who forwarded his description of sighting by mail. Checks were also made with other agencies that could possibly help in identification of this sighting.

II. RELIABILITY: Source mailed his description of sighting and was not personally interviewed. Due to source's position, it is believed by the investigator that he could be considered reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At least three objects were observed from the control tower at Lincoln AFB, Nebr. on 13 Feb 57 for an estimated period of three to five minutes. There was no trace of daylight between the observed time and sighting. Objects were first observed in the northwest and disappeared into the northwest. Source stated objects had the brightness of an automobile headlight that was a mild or more area and above the size of a baseball held at arm-length.

Objects were red in color and color remained constant as did the shape. Source was unable to estimate the speed of objects but said they were traveling at a steady pace. Objects appeared to be solid.

Source could not remember anything of the weather conditions at time of sighting.

Source stated that objects made no particular impression on him and did not think of them as UFOB's, therefore he did not report them.

II. RELIABILITY: Source appeared to be of average intelligence and was enthusiastic in his effort to help solve this problem. He had a firm conviction that he had never seen objects such as these and carefully thought out his answer to questions asked.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source's attention was brought to objects by a passing air liner while scanning his assigned some from the control towers. Source was looking to the northwest when objects were first noticed and to the east when he last saw them.

Objects were red, flashing or rotating type about the size of a dime held at arm's length. They moved at a relative high speed and somewhat erratic. At times, they seemed stationary and then would suddenly move. Over the objects appeared to separate and move in opposite directions. Source estimated objects were 10 to 15 miles, perhaps 10 to 15 miles. Time to observe them for a period of thirty minutes.

At one time objects were in some semblance of formation and when they broke formation, they seemed to move off in a plane or pattern whereas prior to that, direction of movement was hard to ascertain.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was sincere and eager to help. His ability to remember the facts of his observation was excellent, considering his observation was made by radar and the fact that he was working at aircraft at the time.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 13 Feb 57 at 0136 CST, Source, working a B-47 aircraft in the GCA pattern near the control tower, called an intercom and asked if he had any targets to the north of the station. A check was made and he noticed four targets at fifteen radar miles. At the same time a known commercial air liner in the same which descended for some, but the other three were unidentified. Air time was estimated to be approximately 300 mph. The unidentified objects were about five to six miles to the rear of the liner, moving twice as fast.

Initial contact with objects was made on a bearing of 360 degrees (msg) or a 180 mile tangent (mag). Courses of 280 degrees (mag) one of these objects broke in two, three were a 180 degree turn and proceeded on a course of 070 degrees (mag). Three of the objects, which were in loose formation of 070 degrees (mag), last seen approximately twenty miles from GCA site on course of 210 degrees (mag). The radio objects were approximately 1/4 mile from site on course of 020 degrees (mag). Last contact was at 0607 CST.

Objects were interrogated on three modes of IFF with no response.

Source stated he could not estimate the size of the objects because of the unknown shape, however, the blip on his scope was, about the same size that he received from a B-47.
