11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Two AF pilots on practice bombing run sighted what they believed to be a plane with landing light. Obj appeared large, bright yellow, and definitely not similar to an a/c.

First light observed observers a/c from a W direction on a collision course appearing imminent. Obj then turned S and accelerated rapidly to a high alt by climbing at an angle of 30 deg.

COMMENTS: Check for balloon launches and a/c in area was made. Results: Observers stated that, only one not a plane or other body. Both observers have had considerable flying experience.
