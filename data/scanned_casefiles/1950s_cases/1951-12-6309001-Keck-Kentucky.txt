MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief of Staff, USAF
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting.

1. In reply to your request for information concerning a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object, you are advised that at approximately 19:10 in 23 December 1953, my wife, my son and I were proceeding from my quarters at Earnest Harmon Air Force Base, Stephenville, Newfoundland, to the Officers' Club. It was a clear cloudless night, with a very bright moon, and we noticed a bright light, with a very elongated, cylindrical shape, which was almost directly overhead. The light was approximately 25 to 30 miles distant, and suddenly it began abruptly to change to a thin contrail type cloud appearing from the outer atmosphere. As this cloud form descended the contrail began to widen, then changed to grey and progressed into black. The cloud extended from the vicinity of the moon and disappeared beyond the horizon to the west. It had no visible movement, but apparently appeared all at once. I received no report from the another aircraft control tower where other persons had observed the same phenomena.

2. The gray of the cloud apparently returning from Sunnyvale to Earnest Harmon observed this same phenomenon, with the addition that they saw the contrail pass overhead and disappear to the westward in a flash of white light, apparently in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. A reporting of this sighting has been received.

OCR Output:
On the 7th of December 1951 between approximately 7:00 P.M. and 7:30 P.M. Central Standard Time, a luminous object was observed in the sky over Keck, Kentucky by four persons: Mrs. Loueilla Keck, her husband, and their two children.

The objects was described as round in shape, about the size of a basketball and luminous with a white or bluish-white glow. It moved rapidly across the sky at an altitude estimated to be about 1,000 feet. The object made no sound and left no trail. It was visible for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing.

The witnesses stated that the object appeared to be under intelligent control, since it made abrupt changes in direction and speed during the observation. 

This case was investigated by a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, United States Air Force. The report concludes that this observation could not be identified as any known object or phenomenon and that the witnesses were credible. The report is classified as "Unidentified".

Text transcription:

The written information listed here for a perusal of this report in hopes a similar case would be entered. The matter is perplexed and a special investigation is called for.

An earlier report that was lost showed a similar type of object and several witnesses had observed a similar type. It was thought by the witnesses that an airplane or dirigible light was observed but the shape did not at all coincide with any known aircraft. The same characteristics were noted.

Col. Hathaway reports that the. Matters, material, reported June 6th from Hopkinsville, Kentucky is incomplete and a similar type may have been observed at that time. It is requested that any reports of a similar nature received be forwarded so that a complete file may be made for further study.

Distribution write-in to Director, Air Intelligence that some understanding exists in connection with this case matter. For whitten does not say he was the only one to seeor observed by Hughes. The report was written to try and improve the intelligence and observation of Air Force personnel on unexplained aerial phenomena.

As per your request, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

Our view was obstructed beyond this point as the mountain ridge became higher.
5 shooting stars, these 5 were counted as a shooting star. It started behind the mountain ridge and came from the north. It made about 5 degrees of arc and was a brilliant white color. As it disappeared back to the northeast, there was a slight puff of smoke which lasted about 2 seconds. I saw 4 more objects following the path of the first one. They were not as brilliant nor as large as the first, but were a blue-white color. They came from the northeast at about the same angle as the first one and disappeared to the southwest. Space vehicles were seen at the time, speed was estimated at about 2000 miles per hour.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn diagram or sketch rather than a photograph. The diagram depicts a mountain ridge with a number of concentric circles or swirls radiating outward from it. The text mentions "Mountain Ridge" and "Mountain Ridge" and discusses the appearance of objects in the sky. 

Producing the text from the document:

On Dec 26, 1951 us went int DARK. sky. cove was in the center of the DARK Circle Lighting up an area about 400 yrds wide the cover was irregular in shape much like the outline of a large low cumulus cloud, it was brilliant white like magnesium Burning. The cover was about 100 yrds high at the center and tapered down at the edges. It hovered for several minutes, then moved out over the MOUNTAIN Ridge and DISAPPEARED. Mr. & Mrs. X & 2 children saw it, it made no noise, it was real close, I was called to come & see it but by that time it was going over the Ridge and had DISAPPEARED. I could get no picture. The view only lasted for 3 or 4 minutes. This was Central Standard Time. From then until we could no longer see it, it was apparently stationary, but the sky was dark and the object was brilliant white, so as contrasted with the sky it may have been moving slowly. The objects were not much different than many "stars" I have seen, except that they were brilliantly lighted, as I described. I think it was some kind of aircraft, but I do not know what.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJ: Reference Investigation of UFO Report 12 December 1951

1. I called General Witten at Olmstead who was away on a trip, no contact.
2. I called Colonel Hughes, RM 3253, Pentagon, Tel 25661, National Guard Bureau, explained to Colonel Hughes the purpose of the call and he gave me the following information:
The incident was observed the incident at about 1930 hours Christmas Eve, 1951 at Harmon. I had personally reported to General Witten and in the next day or so two days I had corresponded to prepare a complete report which involved getting statements from some 20 people who had observed the incident. It was his impression that this report had been forwarded to the USAF. As I discontinued the distribution of the incident.

3. The incident was of a glowing object with a full moon (greater than 30 miles) at about 1930. He and his family were on the way to the club when they observed the object. His attention was drawn to it having the consistency of a football which started very high to the right of the moon. It turned black, at one point in the control there was lateral displacement. A later check with the weather station indicated a wind shift of 120 degrees toward the object. Those outside the atmosphere saw it come down to the earth, the opening was about 750 feet in diameter. Two officers, Colonels Rombeau and Mitchell were flying a routine flight at the time and confirmed the object. They indicated that it disappeared into a white flash into the Gulf.
