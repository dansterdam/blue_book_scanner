MEMORANDUM FOR:   Chief of Staff, USAF
                  Attn: Director of Intelligence.

SUBJECT:           Unidentified Flying Object Sighting.

1. In reply to your request for information concerning a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object, you are advised that at approximately 19:10 in 23 December 1950, my wife, my son and I were proceeding from my quarters at Earnest Harmon Air Force Base, Stephenville, Newfoundland, to the Officers Club. It was a clear cloudless night, with a full moon which was almost directly overhead. The visibility was exceptional and estimated at 30 miles or more. Suddenly a cloud appeared approximately 10 degrees of the moon, it began abruptly as a thin contrail type cloud doping into the atmosphere. As the cloud form descended the contrail became heavier, then changed to grey and progressed into black. The cloud extended from the vicinity of the moon and disappeared beyond the horizon to the west. It had no visible movement, but apparently appeared all at once. I received reports from base operations, from the weather bureau, and from the control tower where other persons had observed the same phenomenon.

2. The crew of the G-82 aircraft returning from Sunnyside to Earnest Harmon observed this same phenomenon, with the addition that they saw the contrail pass overhead and disappear to its westward in a flash of white light, apparently in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. A reporting of this sighting was made to headquarters, NEAC. No evaluation of this sighting has been received.

                                                            CLAYTON E. HUGHES
                                                            Colonel, USAF
                                                            Chief, O & T Branch, AFD.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Nov 1951 Col Clayton Hughes, in
Company with his wife, was leaving the
officers club at Hanson AFB and were
enroute to quarters. After driving east
from blocks, then turning north, Mrs.
Hughes called the attention of Col Hughes
a peculiar flying object. Simultaneously
Col Hughes continued to observe these
as he drove on to quarters. The time of
this sighting was 2355.

On getting out of the car further
observation was made. There appeared to
be four objects of formation below and
about 108° to the west of the moon and
very high. The formation seemed to
form the approximate density of cotton
and appeared to be crystal white in color.

Within a minute or two of the first
observation, the formation moved to
a position slightly under the moon
and three of the objects spread out and
appeared to form the letter H/O/N. This

The entire document: listed for
a period of five or six incidents before
The formation disregarded disappear

As order to verify the sighting Col.
Hughes had called his deputy who took
in turn several outlines and apparently
sighted the same phenomena.

Col Hughes reports that Mrs. H. White,
another point with partial hook. The
same night had observed a similar
type formation at 0015 hrs, twenty minutes
after the first sighting. Gen written
something was in the same relative position
on the clouds as in the first sighting.

Conversation with Gen White indicates
that some misunderstanding exists in connection with
this statement. Gen White does not say he saw
anything but that the report was made to him by
Hughes. In the absence of report -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

"...914, we counted 5 shooting stars, these were seen to be curved traced by the object of its motion. In the area of the first location of large ones we looked back to the northeast, there we saw 4 more objects following the path of the first. These were closer together, but not as brilliant nor as large as the first. Neither did they move around as much, but seemed to move on a straighter course. These were of a blue-white brilliance seemed to travel at the same rate of speed.

OUR VIEW WAS OBSTRUCTED BEYOND THIS POINT AS THE MOUNTAIN RIDGE BECAME HIGHER."

The document appears to be a UFO sighting report with a detailed diagram showing the trajectory and movement of observed objects, with "MOUNT ANN RIDGE" labeled on the side of the diagram.

120 Reporting CST

On Dec. 21, '51, we were in Ky. sitting on the porch we saw this brilliant, red-orange object move across the tops. We saw in the bright starry night with brilliant red-orange was unlike any of the stars. This object then seemed to come forward. Then go back, with a flash like a large diamond, with a blunted triangular shape, a cluster of yellow, red-orange. It was 1/2 second. "Danced" as if it would get bright & dim but not so quickly.

From then until we could no longer see it, it seemed to a change size & color, staying on a straight course & falling GN 9:43 several times. Within a few seconds, about 5 or 6 times we looked back to it.

This was Central Standard Time.
The sky was dark & clear & all the stars were visible. That is why we could definitely tell that the objects were so much different. There were 9 of us witnessing this spectacular until 9PM, my husband & I continued watching until 10:45.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Reference Investigation of UFO Report, 19 December 1951

1. I called General Witten at Olmstead who was away on a trip, no contact.

2. I called Colonel Hughes, Rm 3E25J, Pentagon, Tel 52061, National Guard Bureau. I explained to Colonel Hughes the purposes of the call and he gave me the following information:

"I had observed the incident at about 1900 hours Christmas Eve, 1951 at Harmon. I had personally reported to General Witten and in the next day or two days I proceeded to prepare a complete report which involved getting statements from some 20 people who had observed the incident. In was impressed that the report had been forwarded to HQ NEAC and to HQ USAF. Description of the incident is:

It was a clear, cloudless night with a full moon. Visibility excellent (greater than 30 miles) at about 1900. He and his family were on the way to the club when one of his roommates called his attention to a white cloud lying the constancy of a contrail which started very high to the right of the moon. As the contrail approached the earth it turned black, at one point in the contrail there was lateral displacement. A later check with the weather station indicated a wind shift at 18,000 feet. The contrail appeared to have come from outside the atmosphere down to earth bearing was about 75° to 250° true. Two officers, Colonel Rosenbaum and ? Mitchell were flying a C-32 at this time, enroute to Harmon, they too observed the contrail and indicated that it disappeared into a white flash into the Gulf."
