AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

LOCATION: Kimpo, Korea
DATE OF REPORT: 13 September 1954
DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 6 September 1954

REPORTED BY: E Bridgett Jr., 2nd Lt. Intell Off
SOURCE: 4th Ftr Intercep Gp Intelligence APO 234

SUMMARY:
An UFOB was observed between 809302 and 809402. The objects were observed by two pilots. They appeared to be stationary during observation. The pilots were low or ral, so they had to return home before the objects disappeared. Reliability of the pilots may be judged as good.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION CLASSIFIED

1. Description of the object(s):
   a. No description as to definite shape of the object could be determined by the observers.

   b. The observers estimated that the objects appeared to be about the size of a pint head held at arm's length - approximately 6 inches apart.

   Note: Mathematical computing using triangulation revealed the objects were at 50,000 feet above the earth or 25,000 feet above the observers.

   c. The objects were either silver or white in color.

   d. There were two objects sighted.

   e. The objects were abreast each other at about the same altitude.

   f. Negative

   g. Negative

   h. Negative

2. Description of source of observation:
   a. Standout

   b. The objects were at 115 degree angle of elevation to the observers. The sun azimuth was approximately 10 degrees.

   c. The objects were at about 35 degrees of angle of elevation when the observers left the area. The sun azimuth was approximately 10 degrees.

   d. The objects appeared to be stationary and did not disappear during the time the observers were in the immediate area.

   e. The pilots returned to base and the objects had not disappeared.

   f. The objects were observed for about ten (10) to twelve (12) minutes.

3. Manner of observation:
   a. Air Visual

   b. N/A

   c. The sighting was made from two (2) F-86F aircraft with

10. The sighters made once narrative orbit around the balloon.

11. Negative.

12. A check of the weather details balloons, released from the Yosu J-780L-76 base was in the area at the time. Similar flights in the area were conducted. However, only one balloon was released and two objects were sighted.

No possible explanation for one or my part could be identified as the cause of the sighting. The TADC in the area could identify the two aircraft, but had no other objects.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

I was leading a flight of two F-86's on the evening of 9 Sept 1954 when my wingman sighted two unidentified objects.

The mission was to carry out a combat air patrol over Seoul, Korea. Our task for the day was F-1451 and our cell sign was Maple. I was leading under Edgar after take off. We were on contact sweep with 1st Lt. Edgerton. A radio contact was not too good with Satar, we were under Edgar's control.

Then gave us a step to home and release us for local flight. I started a climb to about 1500 feet and then started a climb to the vicinity Southeast of K-14, heading 060 degrees. I started a left turn, crossing over Seoul, to a turn to a direction back to K-14. During this turn, my wingman (it looks like the name is cut off) called out a bogie at our two o'clock position. I sighted the object at three o'clock like position. I then pulled out and leveled off at about 30 degrees high, approximately 14,500 feet altitude.

We went to Blue Channel and contacted Dog. They were unable to identify the military object beyond us. I was guiding 315 degrees and five o'clock position.

At the bottom of the document, there is a note stating: "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS INFORMATION AFFECTING THE NATIONAL DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES..."

The document is signed at the bottom, but the signature is difficult to read clearly.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From: 4th Fighter Intercept
Gp Intelligence AFO 74     IR-3-54     PAGE 2

On the 9 September 1954 at 1741 hours, myself and 1st Lt. Hesterman were scrambled over the Seoul area for an intercept mission. I was flying the number two position. We checked in with Badger and then went to Saten's control.

Heading over then went in the YB area. Saten then ran practice intercept with us and a flight called Bucket 65. The action was pretty well under control. Saten then released us to Badger. Badger then ran another practice intercept for landing after giving us a 080 degree steer to homeplate.

At an altitude of 24,000 feet, I spotted two objects high above us about 45 degrees up from the horizon. We were in a left turn at the time. I called out of the left turn and flew not for about two minutes. We called Badger to find out if they had seen anything. They said they had two friendly aircraft which were probably at times of the sighting 1550 hours.

Rolled into a tight turn to visually identify. The two objects were about 10-15 miles away. Closing in, the objects were about 10-15 minutes apart. The weather height was not too good but above 20,000 feet it was good.
