AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Country of Activity Reporting: USA
Location: Coast of California
Activity Submitting Report: 552d AWING Wing Intelligence
Preparing Individual: James J. Hayes, 1/Lt., USAF
Name or Description of Source: Intelligence Officer
Aircraft Commander: William A. Maupin, 1/Lt., USAF

Date of Collection: 27 April 58
Date of Report: 27 April 58
Date of Incident: 23 April 58

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object

At C9532, 27 April 1958, three members of an MATS RC-121, spotted a bright object, which passed in front of the aircraft. The object had not been picked up on the aircraft's radar and a check with the landbase revealed no known aircraft in the area of the sighting. (Details, see Part II of this report.)

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
The sighting was made by three persons, who are familiar with this area of the incident and the nature of airborne traffic in the area. The pilots considered it may have been an afterburner but felt a report should be made. Visually, the object was seen about 2 to 3 miles; was picked up by the radar of the RC-121 and B. A check with Object was not ground site reported no known aircraft in the area or with the land-based ground site. On this basis further investigation by technically qualified personnel seems warranted.
