AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFOB)
LOCATION: Danvers, Massachusetts
DATE OF REPORT: 29 June 1954
PREPARED BY/UNIT: Captain, USAF
SUMMARY: The report describes an unidentified object sighted in the sky. The object was extremely small, about 1/3 in diameter at arm's length, and white in color. The observer stated he happened to be looking at the sky when the object was sighted. The object was observed at 50 degrees from the horizon, traveled for about 10 to 12 degrees from southwest to northeast in a straight line, and then disappeared from view after 20 seconds. The use of binoculars was not successful in observing the object.

Gentlemen:

On June 29, 1954, at approximately 9:30 P.M., I observed a bright object in the sky which I believe was a flying saucer. It appeared to be round and very bright, reflecting like a mirror. It did not blink or flash, but seemed to remain steady and solid. It moved very rapidly across the sky toward the northeast.

The object traveled in a straight line and its speed was phenomenal. I estimate its size to have been approximately the same as the moon, and it was visible for about 15 seconds. There was no noise of any kind associated with the object. After it had disappeared, the sky was clear and distinct against a clear blue sky.

When my son arrived, the object was disappearing. He saw it for only a few seconds. I doubt that. It did not appear again, although I searched the area and along the projected trajectory for some minutes, both with the naked eye as well as with the binoculars.

On the following day at approximately the same hour, I observed several airplane; planes and a thin trail of smoke which could not be positively identified as being from the same object. Using the moon for comparison, which was visible at about the same location, the size of the object appeared to have been about the same as the moon.

Very truly yours,
[Redacted]
