Gentlemen:

At about 12:45 p.m., June 24, 1954, I observed a strange object in the sky northwest of my home in Danvers, Mass. The weather was clear, and I was still clouds drifting from the southwest. I observed a small object, slightly in shape, and completely within the sky, traveling in a straight line, at an elevated altitude of about 500 ft. above the horizon, moving from the Southwest toward the Northeast.

The object traversed an arc of about 45° in approximately 30 seconds. I estimated the time on the watch as long at it took my arm to go into the house and set my chronology at about 12:45 p.m. During this time, I watched the object continuously. There was nothing unusual about the object's color, which was white, and I removed them and noted that the object became somewhat less distinct, but was otherwise unchanged. There was no noise of an airplane in the sky at the time, although the wind was toward the north. The object did not leave a trail of any kind. The object did not glisten, but appeared to be very white. It was sharp and distinct against a clear blue sky.

Then my son arrived with the binoculars, the object was becoming less distinct. By the time I had brought them to my eyes and focused, the object had disappeared. A small cloud was in the area and it may have gone behind that, but I doubt it. It did not appear again, although I searched the area and along the projected trajectory for some minutes, both with the naked eye as well as with the binoculars.

On the following day at approximately the same hour, I observed several airplanes and other familiar objects, such as birds, flying through approximately the same area and I am certain that what I saw was none of these things.

Using the moon for comparison, which was visible at about the same location on the following day, I estimate the size of the object to have been apparently one-half the size of the moon, or approximately the size of an object one-eighth of an inch long when held at arms length.

Very truly yours,

[Signature and name redacted]
