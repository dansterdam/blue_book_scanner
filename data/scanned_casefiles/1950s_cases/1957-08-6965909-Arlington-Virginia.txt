II. RELIABILITY: The physical and mental state of the Source induced by
    over-indulgence was such as to preclude the possibility of a comprehensive
    comprehensible interview.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source stated that approximately
    2330 hrs was sitting in the yard of her home when called her attention
    to an object in the sky. The object was described as resembling a bright,
    round, pink-like disk or cargo cage. The Source said the object was
    Approximate size of a lemon held at arms length. She observed the object for
    approximately 20 seconds before it was obscured by trees. It was described as
    moving very slowly across the sky in a straight line from south to north.
    Source could give no further information.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. Investigation conducted with the United States Weather Bureau and
Weather Service, Andrews AFB, Washington, D.C., plus the characteristics of the
object indicated by the Sources were to illuminate the possibility that the
object was a weather balloon. In addition, the wind conditions during the
period of the sighting were such as to evaluate the probability of a balloon
being present in the area of the sighting.

2. Information obtained from the United States Naval Astronomical
Observatory, Washington, D.C., indicated that no unexplained astronomical
phenomenon occurred during the period of sighting. The duration of the sighting
was such as to limit the possibility that the object observed by the Sources
was a drifting star or meteor. The characteristics of the object as described
did not conform favorably to a star or planet hypothesis.

3. On the basis of all the facts considered it does not seem probable
that the sighted object was an optical phenomenon.

4. Taking into consideration the unreliability of the Sources, and the
obvious difficulty of accurately judging weight and speed of night aerial
composition that the object was a jet aircraft. Conversations held with jet pilots
indicated that a configuration as described by the Sources could be possible if
a jet aircraft was flying with its afterburner in operation. Sources reported
is situated approximately 20 feet from a heavily traveled highway. The
possibility exists that the sound of the aircraft was not heard because of
highway traffic noise.

COMMENTS OF THE APPROVING OFFICER:

1. Concur with Preparing Officer that this sighting was possibly caused by an aircraft equipped with a turbonav. The apparent metallicity of the source precludes a firmer analysis.

Surface - 350 degrees - 3 knots
6,000 - 350 degrees - 17 knots
10,000 - 350 degrees - 17 knots
14,000 - 350 degrees - 16 knots

II.  SUMMARY:   Sources stated they observed a bright object in the sky
     traveling from north to north for approximately one hour (90) seconds. The object
     was described as traveling 1500 to 2000 miles per hour by two sources, and

    Address: [redacted], Arlington, VA.
    Age: 17
    Occupation: Unemployed. Has worked as film processor
    Education: Completed 10th grade
    Qualifications: No special technical qualifications or training

II. RELIABILITY: During investigative process Source displayed signs of
recent alcoholic influence. Source indicated that he had an avid interest in the
type of occurrence reported and had been similar objects before. Source appeared to
be of average intelligence. Answers to questioning were given in a positive and
unequivocal manner. Source had no technical background or outstanding capabilities
to increase the reliability of his observations. In the opinion of the investigator
the Source and information should be considered unreliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source stated that at approximately
2315 on 17 Aug 57 he was sitting in the steps of his home when he noticed a round,
bright, orange-colored object in the sky. The object was described as the
comparative size of the head of a pin or a sea held at arm's length. He indicated
that the object was traveling from south to north, at approximately 50,000 feet and
at a speed of not less than 2,000 miles per hour. Source based this estimate of
the speed on observation of jet aircraft flying in the vicinity of his home which
he felt were traveling 500 miles per hour. The object was reportedly 45° above
horizon when it was first observed and passed in a straight line across the sky.
Source stated that he observed the object for approximately 90 seconds losing visual
contact when it was obscured by trees. Source indicated he was certain of the period
of sighting. He said there were many stars, however the moon was not visible. The
weather was described as cool and dry with no wind noticeable. The object was
brighter than the background of the sky and did not appear to stand still at any
time. During the period of sighting, however, the object appeared to pick up speed
before he lost sight of it. The object did not break into parts, give off smoke or
change shape. The object did not flicker. Source said he had no explanation and
did not more hesitate or front of anything during the period observed. The object
was observed with no radar or similar tracking. Source said he was fairly confident.
Source indicated that he called the attention of his father and mother to the object.
Source stated he had no idea what the object was.

II. RELIABILITY: Source appeared to be in earnest regarding the information submitted. However, his observations were definitely influenced by his own and wife's. The behavior of his wife-canvasser during the interview and his made efforts to restrain her enthusiasm. Source appeared to be of average intelligence. He was cooperative throughout the interview.

However, on the basis of evident pressure exerted on the Source prior to and during the interview the Source and the information

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source stated he was resting outside his home when his wife and son called his attention to an object in the sky. In a casual conversation with a next-door neighbor he stated that while he was outside, an object was held at arm's length, and a light reddish color. He indicated when no one else was present, he could see it quite distinctly at 50,000 feet.² The object was reportedly 900 above the horizon when it was first observed. The object was a straight line across the sky. He said he observed the object for approximately 90 seconds losing visual contact when it was obscured by trees. Source indicated there were many stars, however the moon was not visible. The object was described as brighter than the background of the sky and resembled the brightness of automobile headlights, several yards away.

The object did not move behind or in front of anything during the period of observation. From the description, it gave off smoke or change shapes. The object did not move behind or in front of any trees. During the period of observation, the moon and stars were with a slight breeze noticeable. He said it did not flicker, torch or pulsate. The object was observed with the naked eye and appeared to be still and sharply outlined. Source stated he had no idea what the object was.
