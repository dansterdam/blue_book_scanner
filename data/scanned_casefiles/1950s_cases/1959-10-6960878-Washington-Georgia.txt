OCTOBER 13, 1959.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

On the afternoon of October 12, 1959, I was at my residence on [redacted] in [redacted], Georgia.

At approximately 3 o'clock in the afternoon of this date, I began mowing my lawn in the rear of my house using a motor driven rotary type mower.

At approximately 3 o'clock, I came to a section near a shade tree and I noticed two white streaks, or more correctly, gray streaks extending from an East to West direction, approximately eight inches wide and extending for a length of perhaps ten feet each. The color of this streak was not a bright nor a dull gray, but of a medium texture. I noticed no light reflection from it.

My initial impression was that some type of mold or fungus was present on the grass. The entire length of each blades was covered with this matter. I noticed no silken strands or similar matter. It was also covered with this material, and the appearance of this stuff was as if someone with a air pressure spray type paint gun had sprayed the grass.

After looking at it for a few moments, I decided that it was a mold and moved across it. As the mower went over it, a grey dust rose into the air approximately twenty inches high and as thick back to the earth rapidly.

After mowing the entire section, I noticed that the coloring remained about the same.

After mowing the yard, I left my residence and drove up town where I learned that someone had reported an unusual occurrence at a point approximately 10 miles west of [redacted], Highway 17. Accompanied by a friend, I drove out and looked at what appeared to be a spider web formation, and it was while there that I intended that I had something unusual in my back yard.

Returning home at sundown, my wife and I went to the spot in the yard and I pointed out where the streak of coloring had been, since the original covering had completely disappeared. At the end of one of the original lines, the coloring was still distinguishable by the grass being still darker than the surrounding grass.

My wife stated that when she left for work at approximately 7:15, she noticed the same streaks. Five teen age girls came to see this streak and when she noticed the same small amount of gray remaining at the end of her finger, she pointed out the small amount of gray remaining through it and on her finger was a smutty like substance.

DESCRIPTION: Material Residue Allegedly Seen                            PROJECT NO: C-735
            Falling From Air in Vicinity of
            Georgia

PURPOSE:
To identify microresidues that may be found on ground and equipment surfaces in
cited area.

FACTUAL DATA:

a cobweb-like material was claimed to have been seen in the air by several people
at a home between Sparrow, Georgia, and shortly after noon on
12 Oct 59. A complete report on these sightings will be found elsewhere.

Samples were taken from various locations in the area in which the material was
supposed to have fallen, and are as follows:

Sample # 1 - dust from a table top located outside the house. This table top
was only partially exposed during the time of the sightings.

Sample # 2 - small pieces of weathered insulation taken from exterior electrical
wiring behind the house. It was claimed that these wires were covered very heavily with
the web during and shortly after the sightings, but that the web gradually disappeared.

Sample # 3 - water from the bottom of an inverted galvanized iron wash tub.
This water supposedly had been there during the sightings.

Sample # 4 - grass cuttings taken from the bottom of a lawn mower. This
lawn mower was new and had been used one time only in a yard of a house belonging
to a member of the Georgia Highway Patrol, located in Sparrow, Georgia. It
had been used so now over an area discolored by a gray-white powdery substance. (See
statement.)

Sample # 5 - taken from the top surface of yard across the
above-mentioned discolored area. This sample included soil, grass, rocks, and tree
leaves.


- page 9 -

PROCEDURE:
Spectrographic analysis of all samples, or of aqueous or acid extractions of the samples.

Wet chemical analysis of samples for non-metal elements.

RESULTS:
Sample # 1 - No foreign elements.
Sample # 2 - Slight amount of Silver present.
Sample # 3 - Very slight amount of silver present.
Sample # 4 - High amount of silver present.
Sample # 5 - Slight amount of silver present.

All samples contained elements normally expected to be in the particular type sample. The above results show only the elements which could be considered as foreign to the samples. Wet chemical analysis showed a relatively high concentration of mixed halides, but chlorine was the only one in sufficient quantity to be relatively identified.

SUMMARY:
The presence of silver even in small concentrations from such unlikely places as the samples were taken is very significant, and strongly indicates that a silver compound has been widely used. Silver iodide was used in cloud seeding, and other silver halides have been used. Research in this field is constantly being carried on, and it is understood that the University of Georgia in Athens has been engaged in a research project of this type. It has since been learned that the Lockheed Company in Marietta possibly is also engaged in a similar program.

Literature on the subject uses the term "smoke" as coming from silver iodide generators. The 1959 Encyclopedia Americana annual states that "plumes of this material (silver iodide) were successfully tracked in mountainous country in to 25 miles downwind". These terms seem to be descriptive of that which was seen.

It is a good possibility that cloud seeding with a silver salt could have caused the phenomenon.

Memo to Colonel Shoop

SUBJECT: Flash Report on UFO, Sharon, Georgia                                22 October 1959

The following information is reported to you because of the fact it has received some public attention and broadcast over TV at station WAGA of Georgia. As such, the General or his staff may be contacted in regard to this matter end, of course, inquiries will be made to you.

At 1300 hours, 14 Oct 59, a gossamer silk-like substance continued to fall from the sky over Sharon, Ga. for almost 2 hours. According to UFO regulations, this material was investigated by the Provost Marshal's Office, Robbins AFB, Ga. under the personal direction of Maj. Rust.

In a telephone conversation between Maj. Friend and Maj. Rust regarding the best approach to this problem, it was explained to Maj. Rust that incidents of this type (called angels) have been reported numerous times during the last ten years. Maj. Rust was advised to collect samples of this substance.

Accordingly, a portion of the Georgia State Police was able to gather a small portion of this substance which, through 2 investigators designated by Maj. Rust, was submitted to the chemicals and materials laboratory, Robbins AFB for analysis.

The report made by the supervisory chemists of this laboratory, based on a cursory analysis, substantially is as follows: The material is effectively a silver haired a halogen type compound which may be a form of industrial waste. A more detailed chemical examination will be required to establish the exact composition.

Colonel Shoop: This is somewhat similar to cases where industrial substances have been spewed into the air and carried for great distances, such as, cellulose, cotton lint, and other gaseous wastes.

Maj. Friend plotted the wind direction, which was generally W to E, and found the industrial town of Atlanta (70 miles) and Augusta (approximately 30 miles) were almost due west of Sharon, Ga., the scene of this UFO case.

3. A review of the statements made by the above listed personnel revealed the following:

a. The objects sighted were described at two (2) different elevations. At about 2,000 feet, and when directly in line with the sun, the objects were described as artificial snow or angel hair; at tree-top level, the objects were described as threads 10' to 50' long connected at 3/4". The color of these threads was reported to be the same color as a spider web. The observers stated that many thousands of these thread-like objects were seen floating in the air and falling to the ground. Approximately ten (10) of the "threads" were reported to have a small pea size red object, resembling a spider, at one end. When hitting the ground or becoming lodged on tree limbs or wires, the threads would remain visible for a few minutes and then disappear.

b. The objects were observed at the following locations and times:

(1) Three and a half (3 1/2) miles north of Sharon, Georgia at the farm house of Mr. located on Highway Nr. 47.

c. Georgia State Patrol, stated that at about 1500 hours 12 October 1959, while mowing his lawn in the rear of his residence located on Grove Street in Washington, Georgia, he observed on the grass of his lawn two (2) white or gray streaks, approximately 8 inches wide and ten (10) feet long, extending from east to west.

He did not know how these streaks got on his lawn. Sgt Harnerick stated that he observed the streaks for a few moments, decided that they were a fungus or mold, and moved across them. As the lawn mower went over the streaks, a gray dust rose into the air about twenty (20) inches high and settled back to the earth rapidly. Samples of the dirt in Sgt Harnerick's yard, and grass from his lawn mower, were taken for chemical analysis by Mr. Robert Boyd, Chemist, Material Division, RAFB.

On 14 October 1959, Mr. William Shepard, Supervisor Chemist, RAFS, reported that the samples obtained from Sgt. Sgt. yard contained silver halides micro residue. A complete analyses of the samples has not been completed as of the date of this report.

On Monday, Oct. 12, 1959, a phone call was made to our station, at approximately 12:10 PM, from Mrs. that strange object was in the air over his house, and would make calls with. He went into a full description of events leading up to the occurrence of the sighting, and speculations.

and he arrived on the scene at 12:54 PM. What he saw was as follows: Literally thousands of strands of what flying from the S.W. to the N.E. This was cleared from the position of the sun. Car was continued to obtain bearing 7 x 35 (manual) we could see that many of miles were a dispersing of matter from a ball shape. There were floating in the air, and various signs.

Reports of angel hair still come in occasionally to ATIC and, if the explanation is not immediately obvious, are investigated. On the afternoon of October 12, 1959, officials at Robbins Air Force Base, Georgia, received a telephone call stating that unidentified substances were falling from unknown objects in the sky near the town of Washington. Two Air Force investigators arrived in the town before evening to interview the witnesses and examine the material.

The first sighting had occurred shortly before noon, when a farm woman noticed an object in the sky, traveling not particularly fast from southeast to west. A stream of peculiar-looking substance, broad as the vapor trail of a jet plane, was trailing behind and floating toward the earth. The object itself was "as large as a football," brown or black in color, and maintained a perfectly straight, even course. A few hours later in town a few miles northeast, a man mowing his lawn noticed on the grass two whitish-gray streaks about ten feet long and eight inches wide, extending from east to west. Deciding that the peculiar streaks were a fungus or a mold, he moved across them, at once a gray dust rose above twenty inches into the air and then settled back to earth.

The Air Force investigators took samples of the dusty earth and grass for analysis. Chemical tests showed the presence of silver iodide. Finding silver in such an unlikely place posed a problem, but it also pointed the way to a solution. Silver iodide and other silver halides are used in cloud seeding to produce rain; long "plumes" of this material, ejected from planes, have been successfully tracked in mountainous country for distances of thirty-five miles downwind.

A few questions in the right places produced the answer: research teams from the University of Georgia at Athens and from the Lockheed plant at Marietta had been in the air that day, carrying out experiments in cloud seeding. The angel hair was the silver iodide used in the experiment [10].
