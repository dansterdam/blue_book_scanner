AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

United States

Location: Truth or Consequences, New Mexico
Date of Observation: 3 August 1952
Date of Report: 6 August 1952
Source: 24th Air Division (Def)
Type of Observation: Visual

SUBJECT: PICTOBJET

In accordance with AFL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Object Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBREPT), the following report of unidentified aerial objects is quoted:

On 3rd August 1952 at 2220 MST, Mr. [redacted] Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, observed a formation of strange lights apparently hovering in the sky. The objects were seen by another who heard a peculiar vibrating sound leading to the Big Dipper handle. The observer was located in the south edge of Truth or Consequences, looking west of north.

The objects made an intelligent change in formation, and then, seemed to ascend at a rapid rate until out of sight.

The observer measured the angular size of objects to be equal to a jet fighter, estimated the position of objects to be 6 or 7 miles away. (This would place objects over the Truth or Consequences Airport which has a rotating light).

The time of observation was approximately 9 minutes.

The reliability of the observer is considered good.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(1) Shape: Elliptical
Size: In length they were about 10' (3) while of observers little. Fingers, viewed at arm's length. The width was about equal to the width of a 1/8" diameter wire held at arms length.
Color: Light green or lime green with no glow.
Number: Three
Normalization: Vertical inverted 90°
Maneuver: One object, first appearing circular, turned 180° on its axis, so as to appear elliptical, then moved up and over the other two objects in a line formation. This position was held for a short time and the object turned on its axis 180°, changing from circular to elliptical.
Manner of Observation: Observer and follower the first ascending object. Observed from car (approximately 20 seconds) during the time the first object ascended and the last one moved to follow.
Manner of Disappearance: Objects went straight up until they could be seen.
Other unusual features: Only one side of each object seemed to be iridescent.

(2) 2220 to 2229 MST, 3 August 1952

SHORT STATEMENT

On Sunday night Aug. 3rd 1952 at about 10:20 to 10:25 P.M. saw over and to the northwest of the city Truth or Consequences, New Mexico three objects or lights that to no sound peculiar and not of a type that my logic could intelligently explain.

On sight they were suspended in the sky in the area above the Big Dipper handle in two lengths. Their color was about one to 2 width of my little finger in length, and their width would be about the same as a wood match or 1/8". Diameter were held at area lengths.

At sight they appeared motionless or perhaps traveling directly towards me hence appearance of no motion.

Their formation looked to me as follows:
[A hand-drawn diagram showing 4 objects in a formation]

After holding this position for some time (1) began elliptical and made 180 degree path like to a hyperbola or spiral taking position (4). This position was held for some time and (2) showed ellipse turned on its own axis 160° and revolved 100° counter clockwise and traveled after the first circle and (3) then no (4) went through some maneuvers at (2) with the exception it revolved 160°.

This was observed from the roof of my house at 815 Charles Street where I had gone to recover a hamer left there in the daytime.

The color of this light was green or like tinted white. No glow, slightly cold colors.

All movements were graceful and seemed fully controlled, but swift and sudden like something traveling at high speed.

I at once drove to Truth or Consequences Airport and made this report to operator in charge, arriving at about 1020 P.M.

[Rest of document contains biographical details about the witness's professional background]

• Turning clockwise.

• Turning 360° on its own axis at same time as the 180° and traveled at civilly unparallel.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 6th day of August 1952.
