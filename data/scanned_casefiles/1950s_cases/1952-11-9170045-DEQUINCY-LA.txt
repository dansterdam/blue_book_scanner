DeQuincy, La
Nov 28, 1952

Intelligence, Lake Charles Airbase,
Dear Sirs:

Last night between 8:15 and 8:30 I walked out on my front porch and saw a light coming towards me. (my house faces East and is in the uppermost north east corner of Clacasieu parish.) The house was back 60 acres from road that separates Calcasieu and Beauregard parish. The light was very bright and moving resembling the red light of and aeroplane moving like an airplane travels. In a second I saw it wasn't an airplane that the object was much brighter and had began to flicker around. Upon closer observation the light look like this the arrows were two colors: on tip ends green and pointed red and some yellow.

I called the family and told my husband to go to town and tell some one else, but didn't tell him to call the base. I took it for granted that he would, but he didn't and I don't know if the spectators he showed it to did either. Getting back to when I call the family about the time they got to the porch and began to looking all at once the object began to rise in the sky. It went out of sight but came back but never at the altitude it was when I first seen the object. After he left to go to town my daughter thought of some spy glasses we had here, supposed to be like the ones they use to spot submarines during the last war. We took turns looking at the object. The first time I looked the object flickered so it would not stay in the lens. The next time I was shaking, but I soon discovered it was the flickering of the object. The next time I look it looked like an acorn cup lighted with neon light. The outer rim being reddish pink with green red and yellow to the centre.

Each line denotes the color the outer rim being a reddish pink. The next time I looked it looked this way:

The parachute part of object was reddish pink but the long vertical thing was lit red and green look like neon light very bright at intervals it would bend at ends or twirl in a baton movement it would like a snake.

Other time it seems like it had taken altitude and it was a acorn cup just reddish pink all over. This took this same way while other were looking with the spy glasses it seem to be different from the object I saw even after it took altitude. The flicker could be seen with the naked eye. At 10:15 we went to bed and it was still up in the air at about the same altitude when it came back in sight.

This is the only report I have given of object and don't intend to inform anyone else unless it would be the Pentagon.

Yours sincerely,

WORLD AERONAUTICAL C[HART]

The image appears to be a detailed aeronautical chart showing various cities, routes, and geographical features. The chart covers a region that seems to include parts of Louisiana, Texas, and surrounding states. The map is marked with numerous cities, flight paths, and grid coordinates. Some visible city names include:

- Shreveport
- Natchitoches
- Alexandria
- Lake Charles
- DeRidder
- Beaumont
- Houston

The map is divided into sections marked with letters like MB, MA, NC, and others. There are also numerous lines representing flight routes or navigation paths crisscrossing the map.

The top of the document is partially cut off, so the full title of the chart is not completely visible.
