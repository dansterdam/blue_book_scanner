Dear Sir:

The UFO that I reported on 27 September has been identified by an astronomer here in Cincinnati as a planet. The red and green lights on the object which caused my concern were explained by him as a prismatic effect caused by dust particles in the atmosphere. I did not call him until after the object had been reported to Wright-Patterson or I would never have reported it.

I regret very much any inconvenience caused by this report. Thank you very much.
