AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-G, 4602d AISS (ADC)    30-NOV08-1-57    PART ONE    PAGE 2 OF 5 PAGES

I. SOURCE:
Address: [redacted], Maine (HQ 2734)
Age: 44
Occupation: Housewife
Education: High School
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: As an observer and judge of time, distance and size, SOURCE was considered completely unreliable.

III. SOURCE's DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 21 December 1956, at 2103 hours, EST, SOURCE was rinsing out a bottle at her kitchen sink. She looked up and saw a "flying Saucer", (as near) possible to see what they can pick up". It was round, the size of a "washing machine cover" held at arms length, and was "green that shade I have never seen before". There was only one of the objects and it had no tail, trail, exhaust or sound. However, SOURCE's dog barked occasionally at night while outside the house, and SOURCE believed that the dog could not hear sounds from the "saucers" that human ears could not detect. The dog did not bark at this occasion because it was in the living room. SOURCE knew nothing about the terms angle of elevation or azimuth, but stated that "Saucer" was first noticed about ten feet in the air and about fifty feet from her children's metal swing. It moved steadily toward the swing and upon arriving at the top bar the "saucer" disappeared at once. (See Sketch, Incl #1, Part Two). SOURCE could not estimate the speed of the object, but believed it was 25 feet away from her and the way it for from seconds. SOURCE used no optical aids during the sighting, but was looking through her kitchen windows. It was night and dark outside, but SOURCE, when questioned concerning the existing weather condition, stars or moon, would only state that she "wasn't looking at the stars or moon", and had no idea what the weather was like. Nevertheless, she could give a better description of what she saw, she stated that it was definitely a "flying saucer" and that "something has to be transparent on it in order to see the bright green light but it, can't all be, because you would see it coming down".

SOURCE stated that about two weeks prior to this sighting she had and her thirteen year old son noticed a flash of light through the kitchen window. Approximately two weeks subsequent to this sighting SOURCE saw a flash of light through these rear porch windows. Both flashes were seen at night. SOURCE claimed that these flashes came from "flying saucers" that did not come down to earth. When questioned concerning her unshakeable belief that flying saucers are real and come from outer space, SOURCE stated that she had read a Major KEHOE's book on flying saucers about three years ago. She felt the saucers were sent to earth to pick up samples such as "branches from trees". Further, she felt no danger, but believed it her patriotic duty to report her sightings before the "saucers" start landing in the cities.

SOURCE claimed that a whitish substance remained on the children's swing where the saucer disappeared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. Information received from the U.S. Weather Bureau, AUGUSTA, MAINE, revealed that the weather was clear, no storms in the area, some ground fog in low areas, temperature 49 degrees F., dewpoint 45 degrees F., surface wind South at 6 MPH.

2. Captain MATHERS, PRESQUE ISLE AFB Weather Officer, stated that the possibility of marsh gas in a mountainous region such as Mexico, Maine, was extremely remote. Further, existing weather conditions at the time of sighting were unfavorable for ST. ELMO's fire.

3. On 4 February 1957, Mr [redacted] Chief of Police, Mexico, Maine, was contacted in his office and gave the following information in substance:

He had been called to the home of Mrs [redacted] in regard to her sighting of what she described as a flying saucer. She was very nervous and very certain that she had seen an object from outer space. Upon being told that the saucer had touched the children's metal swing in Mrs [redacted] yard, the chief investigated and found that the mark supposedly left by the saucer was the remains of a manufacturer's decal on the top horizontal bar of the swing. Mrs [redacted] could not recall a decal being there. However, when shown a neighbor's swing of the same type showing a decal in the exact same spot, she admitted there could have been a decal on her swing. But she insisted that the flying saucer had ripped the decal from her swing leaving behind the pasty residue partly left when a decal is torn away. No one else in the area has seen such phenomena nor had anyone reported any unusual lights.

Mr [redacted] stated that almost every night deer poachers used spot lights in the hills around the Perry residence. Chief [redacted] accompanied this investigator to SOURCE's residence and was present during the interview.

4. The [redacted] residence was an old type farmhouse with large glass-enclosed porch and many windows. (See sketch). The front porch jutted out adjacent to the kitchen windows through which the sighting was made. BACKINGDOM ROAD wound up from the town of Mexico past the [redacted] house and on over the mountain pass to the North. The distance from the kitchen windows to the children's swing was fifty feet. The "mark" left on the swing was perfectly rectangular in shape and was undoubtedly the remains of some type of decal. The top bar was painted red and when some of the residue at the spot was scraped away, red paint showed beneath.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused by either auto headlights or hunters spotlight reflecting from the many glass windows and doors in-the Perry residence. It is probable that the other "flashes" seen by SOURCE were caused by such reflections.

2. SOURCE was very distraught and so very firmly convinced that she was being visited by "flying saucers", it was extremely difficult to question her. However, since the sighting was of such short duration, appearing at one moment and disappearing the next, and the light moved almost horizontally along her path of vision, it had all the actions of a reflection. Whatever SOURCE saw was between her and the hillside some seventy five feet away at eye level.

WASHINGTON, D.C.

This sounds like a fantastic story but it is true every word of it.

Last Friday nite the Friday before Christmas I was in my kitchen putting up my husbands lunch, for the next day and I went over to my kitchen sink to rinse out a bottle, when I looked out my kitchen window (I have 3 large windows, up over the sink all along in a row so I have a very good view of the yard) I saw a saucer shape object about 3 ft in diameter. It was luminous (like those clocks that glow in the dark) most beautiful shade of green that I have seen. It was about 10 ft from the children's swing what I saw that bright glowing saucer shape shaped like the cover on my Easy Spin Washing Machine It came down on an angle over the children's swing (they are metal type ones) must have been maybe 15 feet coming down on angle got over the swings about 3 feet from the ground and the light disappeared I thought for sure that it was going to land. It might have and than took off immediately. The swings are about 75 ft from the house. That was my actual seeing of one. They have them so perfect that they can land in your back yard. This was a few minutes before 7 o'clock because my clock is directly over the kitchen sink.

That was my actual seeing of one. But we have pieced this together. It was on a Friday nite and we believe it was 2 weeks it could have been 3 weeks before this object appeared that I actually saw. I was washing dishes between 5:30 and 6 o'clock and my boy who is 13 years old was wiping them. I know it was Friday because he wanted to go to the first show at the movies and we take him down and get it when the movies get out. I want to add that we live about 2 miles from town, there are no street lights and open spaces on both sides of the house the only house near me is across the street. This was the conversation the boy and I had while we were doing dishes.

Ma ma Am I seeing things I said no I saw that too He said what was that awful flash of light by the kitchen window I said I don't know but it almost blinded me it was so brilliant. We believe that was the first one and it came down over the house and when it got so many feet near it the saucers thing lights up a brilliant blinding light. Before this came down over the house for about 10 days we could not keep a picture on the T.V. Set it kept rolling over and over. Finally I called the repair man he said I can't find anything wrong but I think you need a new picture tube. But that has been about 6 weeks ago and the T.V. is perfect and has nothing wrong with it. We think at least my husband does that these come down straight and when they come maybe 10 feet from any object they light up that brilliant.

shade of green that I saw. Notice the time it seems to be 2 week intervals. It might take that long for them to come down from where ever they are being launched. It is our opinion that you will not see them unless they get within a certain number of feet from some object. Is there something so many miles up directly over my house and land that they are being launched from.

Whether there is any sound from them I don't know but I do not this. About 6 weeks ago my dog at my hetwean 8 and 9 o'clock sat on my steps and barked for about 15 minutes fact is I thought some one was around so I have 2 flood lights on the sides of my house I turned them on but could see nothing are left them on for about half hour thinking some one might be around. When some one comes up or down the road he goes out after them. He is a watch dog but he didn't leave the steps just barked I am wondering if he heard the sound of one because a dogs hearing is so good.

I have reported this in to the local Civilian Defense but they will send it into Augusta they said there was a comet in the area. There was no comet in my side yard not 3 feet from the ground or there would be a lie in the ground. Will some one please believe me one may reappear at that 2 week or possibly 3 week interval. This is valuable information for our government. I am not seeing things nor am I day dreaming. I am a busy mother with 3 children and a 6 room house to take care of. I have no time to be making up stories or day dreaming.

We live about 2 miles from town, I wrote this letter yesterday afternoon and did not get the chance to mail it and I noticed on the children's swing that there is a cream colored mark about 4 inches across perfectly even. It is on the bar on top of the swing and the rest of the bar is its originally red color. We do not dare to touch it because it may prove of some value. We believe it touch the swing when it went over it.
