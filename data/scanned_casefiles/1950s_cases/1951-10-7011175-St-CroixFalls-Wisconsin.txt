THE KALISZEWSKI-MOORE STATEMENTS
A U.S. Air Corp dispatcher, dating Minneapolis, Minn., April 13, 1949
The statements of two individuals, Kaliszewski & Moore, claim they saw:
KALISZEWSKI'S OWN WORDS WERE: "I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS - IT WAS SPACE SHIPS FLYING AT TERRIFIC SPEEDS, I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE." THEY WERE SIMILAR, TERRIFIC, FAST. THEY HAD A BLUE LIGHT SHINING FROM THE CRAFT.
CHARLES U. MOORE, AN AERONAUTICAL ENGINEER, CONFIRMED SIGHTING THE OBJECTS.
HIS COMMENT: "I WAS ABOUT TO START MY CAR AND SUDDENLY I OBSERVED A PECULIAR CIRCULAR GOLD-COLORED OBJECT PASS ACROSS THE SKY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT WAS ABOUT 100-200 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT DISAPPEARED IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS OF OBSERVATION."
THE AIR FORCE'S BALLOON EXPLANATION WAS NOW A COMPLETE BUST.

The image appears to contain several photographs and illustrations related to a UFO sighting report from Project Blue Book. The main image shows a hand-drawn illustration of a UFO sighting, with descriptive text explaining the event. There are also smaller images depicting a close-up view of the UFO, as well as a map and additional text providing further details about the incident.

FOOTNOTE ON C. B. MOORE
CHARLES B. MOORE, THIS NAME U.S. DISPATCH INFORMED US, WAS "THE MAN WHO FIRST GAVE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO THE EXISTENCE OF THIS OBJECT." THIS STATEMENT IS BASED ON THE U.S. AIR FORCE CONCLUSION THAT THEIR INVESTIGATION OF THIS CASE IS STILL INCOMPLETE.

THE OBJECT WAS ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE, ABOUT 100 FEET IN DIAMETER, IT CROSSED THE PATH OF THE BALLOON AT A VELOCITY OF FROM 600 TO 800 MILES PER HOUR... AT A DISTANCE OF 4 MILES PER SECOND...THAT'S 14,000 MILES!

GLOSS QUESTIONING OF MOORE AND THE OTHER MAN HAVING WITNESS UTE FAGIN'S LANDING
(FAGIN WAS THE BALLOON PILOT)

THE PILOT, STANDS NEAR MEXICO FOR THE FASCINATION PLANE....IT TURNED RIGHT AND
FLEW OFF AT A SPEED AS HIGH AS THAT OF THE BALLOON ITSELF.

DIDN'T THE AIR FORCE
TAKE KALISZENSKI'S
AND MOORE'S ADVICE - 
DIDN'T IT ORDER 200
GRID CAMERAS TO BE
SENT TO STRATEGIC
POINTS...AIR BASES
A-PLANES AND OTHER SPOTS...WHERE SAUCERS
HAD BEEN SIGHTED?

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:
THIS INFORMATION WAS REPORTED THROUGH A PERSONAL LETTER BY AN AGENT AND COVERED BEFORE OR POSSIBLE CROSSING OF THIS OBJECT. A RESIDENT OF SAINT CROIX FALLS, WISCONSIN, STATED HE WAS FLYING AT 10,600 FT. REGARDING THE RAID BAG BALLOON WHEN I SAW A BRIGHT GLOW OBJECT TO THE EAST OF ME. THE OBJECT SUDDENLY STOPPED AND I HAD AN EXCELLENT VIEW OF IT FROM THE SIDE AS I FLEW PAST IT. 

THE OBJECT WAS MOVING FROM EAST TO WEST. IT WAS HIGH AND VERY BRIGHT. WE WERE KEEPING THE SHIP ON A CONSTANT COURSE AND USING BEST SPOTTING MEMBER OF THE WINDSHIELD AS A POINT. THE OBJECT MOVED PAST THIS MEMBER AT ABOUT 30 DEGREES PER SECOND. 

THIS OBJECT WAS PECULIAR IN THAT IT HAD THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A HALO AROUND IT WITH A DARK ENCOMPASSING ZONE. IT CROSSED RAPIDLY AND THEN SLOWED DOWN AND STARTED TO CLIMB IN LAZY CIRCLES SLOWLY. THE PATTERN IT MADE WAS LIKE A FALLING CAR LEAF INVERTED. IT WENT THROUGH THESE GYRATIONS FOR A COUPLE MINUTES AND THEN VERY RAPID ACCELERATION DISAPPEARED TO THE EAST. THIS OBJECT WAS A VERY BRIGHT OBJECT AND I WATCHED FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES.

WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE ITS SIZE, BECAUSE AT THE TIME I DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLOON TO SIGHT FOR A COMPARISON.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Country: UNITED STATES
Report No.: AR 29841
Date of Report: 24 October 1951
Date of Information: 7 October 1951
Prepared By (Officer): FRANCIS L. PRINCE, Captain, USAF, Intelligence Officer
Remarks (Control under, directive, previous report, etc., as applicable): Summary of Report: Given indications paragraphs, list includes at lower left.
1. On 24 October 1951, Mrs. Jeanne Weiskopf, residing at 440 South 2nd Street, St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, reported sighting an unidentified flying object on 7 October 1951 at approximately 6:45 P.M. Mrs. Weiskopf stated that she was out in her backyard at that time and observed a light in the sky which she first thought was a shooting star. However, as she watched, the light seemed to increase in size and brightness and she realized it was not a star. It hovered in the sky for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, then descended slowly and silently to the ground, where it appeared to land or come to rest. According to Mrs. Weiskopf, the object was oval or elliptical in shape, was very bright, and gave off a greenish yellow light. After a short period of time, the object rose straight up from the ground and disappeared very rapidly at a tremendous speed. Mrs. Weiskopf was able to maintain a continuous observation of the object during the entire incident.

2. Mrs. Weiskopf was interviewed by Captain Francis L. Prince, AF Intelligence Officer, on 24 October 1951. She was found to be a very credible and reliable witness. Her observation appears to be an authentic sighting of an unidentified flying object. The fact that there were four men to confirm her report would tend to substantiate her story. In addition, there have been a number of other sightings in this general area which are similar in nature to this one. It is considered that this report warrants further investigation.

The image appears to contain a typed document, likely from Project Blue Book, the official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. It describes a sighting of an object during the trajectory flight and approach of a weather balloon on October 10, 1951, approximately 16 miles east of St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin. The document states that the object was a "strange object crossing the skies" and that the balloon was at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet at the time. The observer, a Mr. Hogland, confirmed that the sighting was not a malfunction, but rather an unusual aerial phenomenon that disappeared from view.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

12 October 1951

Flying Saucer Observation

Time: 1010, 10 October 1951
Place: 16 miles east of St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin
Observers: S. A. and John DeGrossini

We had just spotted our trajectory flight and were approaching from the north on an altitude of 20,000 ft. As we reached a height of 16,000 ft. to 18,000 ft. we sighted a strange object crossing the skies at about 2,000 ft. below. It was a bright day and the object stood out brilliantly. I estimated that our balloon was at approximately 20,000 ft. at the time.

Using our binoculars, we clearly observed the object for a close examination. It was elliptical and about 4 to 5 miles in diameter. The object was glittering and about 8 miles N.E. of the balloon. The object had a peculiar wave-like motion, descending and seemed to move out behind our balloon. It appeared to be moving very rapidly and was on the scene about 1 or 2 minutes when it suddenly made an abrupt turn and disappeared.

I and I observed this object for approximately two minutes and it gave the impression of a stationary object rather than a material object. It moved in such a manner that it could not have been a conventional aircraft, or celestial star.

Signed:
S. A. Hogland

Confirmation of the above sighting is not possible as Mr. ___________ is temporarily at Alexandria, N.M. on a research project for General Mills.

The image contains multiple illustrations and sketches, but no photographic images. The illustrations depict:

1. A sketch of a person (presumably Kaliszewski) in a plane observing a balloon-like object in the sky.
2. A sketch of a ground crew member observing a circular object in the sky.
3. A sketch of a device with telescope-like measurements.
4. A sketch of two individuals, one of whom is identified as Charles R. Moore, an aeronautical engineer.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

THE KALISZEWSKI-MOORE STATEMENTS
A U.P. DISPATCH, DATELINE, MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., APRIL 12, 1955, CARRIES THE STATEMENTS OF TWO TOP OFFICIALS OF GENERAL MILLS, INC., ENGAGED IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND IN CONSTRUCTION OF BALLOONS FOR GENERAL MILLS, CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN SEVERAL UNUSUAL OBJECTS WHILE WORKING ON THEIR PROJECTS IN ST. CROIX, WIS., ON OCT 16 AND 17, 1951.
KALISZEWSKI'S OWN WORDS WERE: "I CAN'T SAY WHAT THEY WERE. I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE. THEY WERE SAUCER-LIKE, ROUND, AND THEY HAD A DARK GLOW. THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY FAST. THEY HAD A GLOWING RING AROUND THEM."
CHARLES R. MOORE, AN AERONAUTICAL ENGINEER FOR GENERAL MILLS, UNDER CONTRACT TO THE GOVERNMENT, CONFIRMED THE SIGHTINGS. HE WAS QUOTED AS SAYING: "I THINK IT'S A COMPLETE BUST!"
