THE KALISZEWSKI-MOORE STATEMENTS

A U.P. DISPATCH, DATELINE, MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., APRIL 12, 1952 CARRIED THE STATEMENTS OF TWO TOP BALLOON EXPERTS. THE STORY, LIKE TWIST, KALISZEWSKI, SUPERVISOR OF BALLOON MANUFACTURE FOR GENERAL MILLS, CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN SEVERAL HIGH SPEED UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS WHILE MAKING TWO SEPARATE AIRPLANE TRIPS OVER MINNEAPOLIS AND ST. CROIX, WIS. ON OCT 10 AND 11, 1951.

Kaliszewski's OWN WORDS WERE: "I CAN'T SAY WHETHER THEY WERE SPACE SHIPS, FLYING SAUCERS OR WHAT, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW. I HAD NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE. THEY WERE STRANGE, TERRIFIC. MY LAST, THEY HAD A PECULIAR GLOW."

KALISZEWSKI WAS IN A PLANE TRACKING A BALLOON FLIGHT WHEN HE SAW THE OBJECTS. HE WENT ON TO STATE:

"WE SAW NO VAPOR TRAIL, AND FROM PAST EXPERIENCE I KNOW THAT THIS THING WAS NOT A BALLOON, JET, CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR CELESTIAL STAR..."

GROUND CREWMEN AT THE GENERAL MILLS TRACKING STATION, DOUG SMITH AND RICHARD DORAN, BOTH CONFIRMED SEEING THE OBJECTS WHILE KALISZEWSKI WAS IN THE AIR) IN A THEODOLITE.

CHARLES G. MOORE, AN AERONAUTICAL ENGINEER IN CHARGE OF BALLOON OPERATIONS FOR GENERAL MILLS, OFFERED:

THE GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO STOP DEPENDING ON CHANCE DESCRIPTIONS AND SET UP A 24-HOUR WATCH UNTIL THESE STRANGE OBJECTS ARE IDENTIFIED. THEY'VE BEEN SEEN AT LEAST 20 TIMES BY PERSONNEL WORKING WITH THE FIRM'S BALLOON OPERATION.

INCIDENTALLY, GENERAL MILLS, WORKING ON ARMED FORCES CONTRACTS, WAS AT THAT TIME ATTEMPTING TO CONVERT A BALLOON CAPABLE OF RISING 100,000 FEET IN THE AIR WITH INSTRUMENTS SENSITIVE TO COSMIC RAY ACTIVITY. MOORE CONCLUDED WITH:

SCIENTISTS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO SAY MORE THAN THAT THE OBJECTS ARE OF UNDETERMINED ORIGIN.

BUT I SUSPECT THAT SOME PRETTY INTERESTING THINGS WOULD TURN UP IF THE GOVERNMENT WOULD ONLY SET UP AN OBSERVATION SIGHT.

J.G. KALISZEWSKI AND G.B. MOORE WERE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF BALLOON RESEARCH.

THE AIR FORCE'S BALLOON EXPLANATION WAS NOW A COMPLETE BUST!

FOOTNOTE ON C. B. MOORE
PROJECT SAUCER CASE NO. 122

CHARLES B. MOORE, THIS SAME U.P. DISPATCH INFORMED US, WAS "THE MAN WHO FIRST GAVE SCIENTIFIC CREDENCE TO THE 'FLYING SAUCER,' WHILE MAKING BALLOON TESTS IS HILLS SOUTH OF SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO (57 MILES NORTHWEST OF THE WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS), HE PICKED UP AN UNKNOWN AERIAL OBJECT ON HIS TRIP OUT."

THE OBJECT WAS ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE, ABOUT 100 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT CROSSED THE PATH OF HIS BALLOON AT AN ALTITUDE OF OVER 30 MILES. IT WAS TRACKED AT 5 MILES PER SECOND...THAT'S 18,000 MILES PER HOUR.

THERE WERE FIVE TRAINED, HIGHLY-SKILLED SCIENTISTS PRESENT. THE DATE WAS APRIL 14, 1943. THESE MEN WATCHED THE SAUCER ALTER ITS COURSE AND ZOOM UPWARD.

CLOSE QUESTIONING OF MOORE AND THE OTHER OBSERVERS BROUGHT OUT THESE FACTS...

THE FORCE NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THAT CHARGE OF COURSE WOULD BE EQUAL TO 20 G'S!

WHITE SANDS, NEW MEXICO MIGHT BE A GOOD LOCATION FOR THE (OBSERVATION)

DIDN'T THE AIR FORCE TAKE KALISZEWSKI'S AND MOORE'S ADVICE? DIDN'T IT ORDER 200 GRID CAMERAS TO BE SENT TO STRATEGIC POINTS...AIR BASES, A-PLANTS AND OTHER SPOTS...WHERE SAUCERS HAD BEEN SIGHTED?

USAF ITEM 12-MCLA

THIS INFORMATION HAS REPORTED THROUGH A PERSONAL LETTER OF HIS RECENT AND REQUEST COMMENT OR EVALUATION. "RINE 6530, 11 OCT 51"

[REDACTED] AND I WERE FLYING AT 10,000 FT. OBSERVING THE RISE BAG BALLOON WHICH I SAW A SLIGHTLY GLOWING OBJECT TO THE S.E. OF U.S. AIRPORT, AT THAT TIME WE WERE A FEW MILES NORTH OF MINNEAPOLIS AND HEADING EAST. I POINTED IT OUT TO DICK AND WE BOTH MADE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS:

"THE OBJECT WAS MOVING FROM EAST TO WEST AT A HIGH RATE AND VERY HIGH. WE TRIED KEEPING THE SHIP ON A CONSTANT COURSE AND USING MEMBER OF THE WINDSHIELD AS A POINT.

THE OBJECT MOVED PAST THIS MEMBER AT ABOUT 50 DEGREES PER SECOND.

THIS OBJECT WAS PECULIAR IN THAT IT HAD WHAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A HALO AROUND IT WITH A DARK UNDERSURFACE. IT CROSSED RAPIDLY AND THEN SLOWED DOWN AND STARTED TO CLIMB IN LAZY CIRCLES SLOWLY. THE PATTERN IT MADE WAS LIKE A FALLING OAK LEAF INVERTED. IT WENT THROUGH THESE GYRATIONS FOR A COUPLE MINUTES AND THEN WITH A VERY RAPID ACCELERATION DISAPPEARED TO THE EAST. THIS OBJECT, DICK AND I WATCHED FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES.

"I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE ITS SIZE, BECAUSE AT THE TIME I DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLOON TO SIGHT FOR A COMPARISON.

FORCING MEMBER OF THE WINDSHIELD AS A POINT,

"SHORTLY AFTER THIS WE SAW ANOTHER ONE,
BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T HANG AROUND. IT
APPROACHED FROM THE WEST AND DISAPPEARED TO
THE EAST, NEITHER ONE LEAVING ANY TRACE OF
VAPOR TRAIL.

"WHEN I SAW THE SECOND ONE I CALLED OUR
TRACKING STATION AT THE U.S. M. AIRPORT AND ITS
OBSERVERS THERE ON THE THEODOLITE MANAGED TO
GET GLIMPSES OF A NUMBER OF THEM, BUT COULDN'T
KEEP THE THEODOLITE GOING FAST ENOUGH TO KEEP
THEM IN THE FIELD OF THEIR INSTRUMENTS. BOTH
DOUG SMITH AND DICK DORAN CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF
THESE OBJECTS IN THE THEODOLITE AFTER I
NOTIFIED THEM OF THEIR PRESENCE BY RADIO."

Flying Saucer Observation

Time: 1010, 10 October 1951
Place: 10 miles east of St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin
Observers: J.G. Kaliszewski and Jack Donahue

We had just spotted our trajectory flight and were approaching from the north at an altitude of 4000 ft. We started a climb towards the balloon on a course of 250°. At 6000 ft. I noticed a strange object crossing the skies from East to West, a great deal higher and behind our balloon. I estimated that our balloon was at approximately 20,000 ft. at the time.

Using our balloon for comparison, this object appeared to be about 1/4 the size of the balloon. We were climbing and about 6 miles N.E. of the balloon. The object had a peculiar glow to it, crossing behind and above our balloon from East to West very rapidly, first coming in at a slight dive, leveling off for about a minute and glowing down, then into a sharp left and climb at an angle of 50 to 60° into the S.E. with a terrific acceleration, and disappeared.

Donahue and I observed this object for approximately two minutes and it crossed through an arc of approximately 40-50°. We saw no vapor trail and from past experience I knew that this object was not a balloon, jet, conventional aircraft, or celestial star.

A U.P. DISPATCH, DATELINE, MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., APRIL 12, 1952 CARRIED THE STATEMENTS OF TWO TOP BALLOON EXPERTS. THE STORY WENT LIKE THIS: J.C.

CHARLES B. MOORE, AN AERONAUTICAL ENGINEER IN CHARGE OF BALLOON OPERATIONS FOR GENERAL MILLS, URGED...

INCIDENTALLY, GENERAL MILLS, WORKING ON ARMED FORCES CONTRACTS, WAS AT THAT TIME ATTEMPTING TO CONSTRUCT A BALLOON CAPABLE OF RISING TO 100 FEET IN THE AIR WITH INSTRUMENTS SENSITIVE TO COSMIC RAY ACTIVITY.
