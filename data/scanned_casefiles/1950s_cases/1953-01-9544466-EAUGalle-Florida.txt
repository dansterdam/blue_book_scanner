Hydrographic Bulletin

NORTH PACIFIC

A cooperating observer reports that on January 22, 1953, at 0927 G. M. T., in lat. 14°09' N, lon. 158°50' E, a meteor was observed low in the southeasterly sky, approximately 5° below the eastern sky, the meteor remaining almost parallel to the horizon and was at first mistaken for an aircraft due to its parallel flight. The phenomenon remained visible for 27 seconds and then disappeared below Capella after traversing roughly 90° of arc.

Weather clear with occasional scattered clouds, small cast-northeasterly sea, low swell, barometer 29.94 inches, temperature air 82° F, sea 82° F.
