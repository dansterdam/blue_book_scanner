The image appears to be an aeronautical chart of a region in the southeastern United States, primarily showing parts of North Carolina and South Carolina. It includes cities like Asheville, Greenville, Spartanburg, and Marion, with various grid lines, coordinates, and radio navigation markers. The chart seems to be focused on aviation navigation and includes topographical details like rivers and terrain.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FLYOBRIT
Elberton, Alabama

DATE OF INFORMATION: 30 October 1952
PLACE: Near Elberton, Alabama

DATE OF REPORT: 24 October 1952
FROM: LADIR, 806th AIR DIVISION
EVALUATION: B-2

Personal Interview with Observer

1st Lt Col Theodore I. Pascoe, 3362A
APL 200.5, 29 Apr 52, A-4939-R, msg 4408 306.6DV
1700 30 Oct 52 and Ltr Hq USAF AFOIN-C/CO2, 19 Dec 52

At 2026 hours CST on 24 October 1952, an unidentified flying object was sighted by 1st Lt Charles J. Ream, A-019229, 52d Bomb Squadron, 68th Bomb Wing (M), Lake Charles Air Force Base, Lake Charles, Louisiana. 1st Lt Ream was acting as Observer on a T-33 type aircraft flying at a speed of 169 miles per hour at an altitude of 7500 feet, and a true heading of 75 degrees.

Object appeared in a position 10 to 15 degrees above horizontal plane of the aircraft, moving at a terrific speed much faster than that of a T-33, in a direction approximately 15 degrees away from the axis perpendicular to the heading of the aircraft, and disappeared at approximately 20 degrees above the horizon. Left the aircraft. Object resembled a plate standing on end, moving in the direction of the compass rose or the object. (See incl 2). The line of sight was very straight, with a constant state of acceleration, i.e., no "floating", as in the flight of a conventional aircraft.

1. Brief description of the objects:
(a) Shape: Oval, fast moving, appeared to be stretched out. Resembled plate standing on end, and moving in direction of concave sides.
(b) Size: Much larger than star "when viewing star from ground, and smaller than the moon.
(c) Color: Deeper orange than parachute flare when observed from 10 miles. Very brilliant. Hot, repeat not, like hazy ball of light such as is seen when viewing tail of a strobe jet aircraft.
(d) Number: One (1).
(e) Elevation if more than one: Not applicable.
(f) Aerodynamic features: No floating characteristics. Object maintained constant state of acceleration.
(g) Tail, or exhaust: Appeared to have a tail, such as a comet.
(h) Propulsion system: None apparent.
(i) Speed: Unable to determine because of inability to properly assess distance.
(j) Traveled extremely fast, much faster than F-80 when viewed from ground.
(k) Sound: None.
(l) Maneuvers: None.
(m) Manner of disappearance: Disappeared into distance as a streak of light.
(n) Other pertinent or unusual features: Object maintained absolutely straight line of flight, and a constant climb of approximately 5 degrees.

2. (a) Time of sighting in 24-hour clock zonal time: 2026 hours CST.
(b) Length of time observed: Approximately 5 seconds.

The Unidentified Object

We were flying at 7500 ft. at an airspeed of 165 W/B/H and heading of 075 degrees in a T-11 at 2026 GST on 24 Oct. 1952. The subject Object appeared in my cone of vision from the left. Slightly above the horizontal plane and passed out of sight to the right passing approximately perpendicular to the course line of the aircraft. It was larger than a star and had a darker color, bordering an orange. It had a high degree of brilliance. A tail appeared behind the object believed to be an illusion caused by terrific speed. A definite shape could not be determined. The line of flight was very straight with a constant state of acceleration and an approximate angle of attack of 5 Degrees
