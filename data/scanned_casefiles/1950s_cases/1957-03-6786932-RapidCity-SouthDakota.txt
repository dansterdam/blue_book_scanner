On 2 March 1957, approximately 12 A.M., A/Sgt and T/Sgt noticed some strange lights in the sky. The rays from the lights seemed to be in a circular pattern landing outside. There was a thin layer of clouds so that I could not see the source of the lights. The lights were changing in color (white, blue and red). They were either changing in altitude or brightness, and seemed to be moving slowly north. I watched this object approximately 30 minutes, went inside, returned 15 minutes later and object had disappeared.
