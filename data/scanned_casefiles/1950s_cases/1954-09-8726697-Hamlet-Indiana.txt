2 Photos.


- page 7 -

The image shows a severely damaged aircraft, likely from a crash. The aircraft appears to be broken into multiple pieces, with its structure twisted and mangled. The photograph is in black and white and seems to be taken in an indoor setting, possibly a hangar or investigation area. The wreckage is positioned on what looks like a flat surface, with the aircraft's components scattered and deformed, suggesting a catastrophic incident.


- page 8 -

The image shows a damaged or crashed mechanical device, possibly an aircraft or part of an aircraft. There are several cylindrical objects (possibly vacuum tubes or similar components) lined up in the foreground. The mechanical object appears to be severely damaged, with twisted and broken parts. The photograph is a black and white image with high contrast, showing details of the wreckage against a light background.

No text is visible in this image.
