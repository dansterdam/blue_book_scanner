The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a series of diagrams illustrating the object's size and movement in relation to the moon. The text below the diagrams provides an explanation of the incident and case, indicating that this is part of a Project Blue Book document.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the full text found in the document:

C-22, Rockford, Ill. .. 9/5/54) As they had done on many occasions, amateur astronomers, Peter Barkus and Theodore Kolim, were watching the moon through a telescope. Between the hours of 10:35 and 11:15 P.M., Barkus observed the moon illuminated, but suddenly a dark object appeared to cross the moon. I observed this strange object through my 6" cassigranion reflector telescope using a secondary mirror. The total focal length for this setup is over 150 and with the use of 150 and 120 power oculars we got tremendous power with the least loss of light. The moon was in a first quarter and its diameter was 25 feet, 6 inches to the observer. Whatever the object was, it was not glowing or brilliant, but seemed more like a dull reflected light of a planet. Its size we estimated at about the diameter of crater Plato. As it crossed the northern or Vlaco. At the time it disappeared at 11:15, it had travelled more than the 29' diameter of the moon in about 40 minutes. We checked our possiblity of meteoric disturbance, and the movement remained steady, not following a true orbit. It was definitely in space, and in the same field as the moon, or near the moon.

The drawings below are Theodore McGown's. They illustrate the object's size and movement in relation to the moon. McGown through calculus, estimated the object to be 1,500 ft. in diameter.

Editor's Note: This incident and Case 14 transcends any notion that "saucer" vehicles are confined to earth's atmosphere; therefore U.S. or Russian origin. Unless these governments are secretly conducting interplanetary travel, the only logical conclusion is that "saucers" are extra-terrestrial and are using the moon as a hopping-off point.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather includes a set of drawn illustrations or diagrams depicting various shapes and silhouettes. Based on the text provided, these illustrations appear to represent the shapes and sizes of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that were reported as part of Project Blue Book.

CASE FILE REVIEW:
Sightings in the U.S., Europe and Australia are continuing and will be covered in this case.

C-22, Rockford, 111...9/3/94) As they had done on many occasions, amateur astronomers, Peter Zager and Theodore McGown, were watching the Moon through a telescope. At about 10:05 P.M. CST they sighted an object which appeared to be about 12-15 feet in diameter. They observed it for about 1 minute and 15 seconds as it moved across the sky. They described it as round and "a brilliant white", and said the illumination from the object seemed to be coming from within it rather than reflected light. They estimated the speed of the object to be around 200-300 mph.

The drawings below are reproduced with the text. They illustrate the objects observed. McCaulley, through calculustimated the object to be 12.3/0 ft. in diameter.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document with text describing an observation of an unusual phenomenon. The text is as follows:

C-22, Rockford, Ill. - 9/5/54) As they had done on many occasions, amateur astronomers, Pete Barricus and Theodore Boglich, were watching the moon through 6" cassegrainian reflector telescope using a secondary mirror. The total focal length for this setup was over 50 feet, and the moon was centrally placed. The moon was in the first quarter and its diameter was 20 feet, 10 inches. We saw a spherical object ascending from the northern section of the Humboldt diam area. It was not glowing or brilliant, but a black silhouette. As the object rapidly increased in diameter, it appeared to be traveling more than the 2000' per second. It tracked more than the 20' 30" of arc in about 40 minutes. We checked out the possibility of atmospheric diffractions in the sky or the object by traversing the soop and could not find any explanation, except that as the moon was descending at 1081 m.p.h, the object was ascending and not following a true orbit. It was definitely in space, and in the same field as the moon, or near the moon.
