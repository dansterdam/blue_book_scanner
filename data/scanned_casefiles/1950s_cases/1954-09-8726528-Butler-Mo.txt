Here is the text from the document:

C-22, Rockford, Ill...(9/5/54) As they had done on many occasions, amateur astronomers, Peter Bartkus and Theodore McColm, were watching the moon through a telescope. Between the hours of 10:35 and 11:15 P.M., Bartkus wrote: "I observed the most unusual phenomena I have ever had the experience of witnessing." Bartkus continues: "The moon was observed through my 6" cassegrain reflector telescope using a secondary mirror. The total focal length for this setup is over 100", and with the least use of 150 and 200 power occulars we got tremendous power with the least loss of light. The moon was in the first quarter and its diameter was 25 feet, 30 inches. We saw a spherical object ascending from the northern section off Mare Humboldtianum area. It was not glowing or brilliant, but seemed more like a dull reflected light of a planet. Its size we estimated at about the diameter of craters Pitiscus or Vlaco. At the time it disappeared at 11:15, it had travelled more than the 29' of arc in about 40 minutes. We checked out the possibility of atmospheric diffraction in the sky or the scope, and by changing the oculars. The object must have been a powered body because as the moon was descending at 108 mph, the object was ascending and not following a true orbit. It was definitely in space, and in the same field as the moon, or near the moon."

The drawings below are Theodore McColm's. They illustrate the object's size and movement at 4 minute intervals in relation to the moon. McColm, through calculus, estimated the object to be 12,500 ft. in diameter.

Editor's Note: This incident and Case 14 transcends any notion that "saucer" vehicles are confined to earth's atmosphere, therefore U.S. or Russian origin. Unless these governments are secretly conducting interplanetary travel, Cases 14 and 22 and myriads of others, add another positive link to the hypothesis that "saucers" are extra-terrestrial and are using the moon as a hopping-off point.

No Case (Information Only)                                                5 Sep 54

CASE FILE REVIEW: Space does not permit the use of all the excellent material received. Sightings in the U.S., Europe and Australia are continuing and will be used in forthcoming issues of the Newsletter.

C-22, Rockford, Ill. - 9/5/94 As they had done on many occasions, amateur astronomers, Peter Bartwas and Theodore McColm, were watching the moon through a telescope. Between the hours of 10:45 and 11:15 PM, Bartwas wrote "Unusual object seen on moon." At this time, they were using a 6" equatorial reflector telescope with a 40mm eyepiece and a Dall-Kirkham mirror. The Grui local length for this camera is 100 and 200 yards. We had a material object ascending from Labor Day weekend. It was not plain saucer-like, but a quill rectangular object of craters, Piteous or Vlaco. At the same time, it traveled more than 300 of the 30° arc. The object was definitely a solid body, becoming less in the occultars. The object seemed to move slowly, becoming less in the moon. It was descending at 101 mph, following a trajectory in the orbit. It was moving through the moon.

Tire drawings below are Theodore McColm's. They illustrate the object's size and movement at 4-minute intervals in relation to the moon. McColm, through calculus, estimated the object to be 12,5/10 ft. in diameter.

[A diagram of 5 moon phases with an object's movement is shown]

Editor's Note: This incident and Case 14 transcends any notion that "saucers" are confined to any atmosphere, atmosphere J.G. or Russian origin. Unless these governments are secretly conducting interplanetary travel, Cases 14 and 12 and myriads of others, add another positive link to the hypothesis that "saucers" are extra-terrestrial and are using the moon as a hopping-off point.

The moon was in the first quarter and its diameter was 25 feet, 30 inches. We saw a spherical object ascending from the northern section of Mare Humboldtdianum area. It was not glowing or brilliant, but seemed more like a dull reflected light of a planet. Its size we estimated at about the diameter of craters Pitiscus or Viaco. At the time it disappeared at 11:15, it had travelled more than the 29' 30" of arc in about 40 minutes. We checked out the possibility of atmospheric diffraction in the sky or the scope by traversing the scope, and by changing the oculars. The object must have been a powered body because as the moon was descending at 1081 mph, the object was ascending and not following a true orbit. It was definitely in space, and in the same field as the moon, or near the moon."
