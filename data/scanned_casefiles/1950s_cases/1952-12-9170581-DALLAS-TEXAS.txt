JOINT MESSAGEFORM

FROM: AFOIN-NTIA-1-9-3

Concerning the electronic sighting of 14 Dec 52 over Dallas, Texas, ATIC finds that before a suitable analysis can be made it will be necessary to obtain prints from the original G-45 film. The negative copy you have forwarded us unfortunately lacks enough detail.

Therefore, ATIC would appreciate your forwarding 8"x 10" glossy prints of every third frame of the original film.

In reply cite Project Blue Book.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

AFPG, GAP 04                                                                    PAGE    1    OF    2    PAGES

1. Object not seen visually. Whenever the AN/APQ-11 radar would lock on (a function of the AEA), and track the phenomenon, all available processed then would visually search the area in front of the aircraft. In the direction and distance indicated by the AN/APQ-11. Nothing could ever be seen. The AN/APS-23 operator would then search the one space in front of the N-36, and would always detect the phenomenon. The signed statements of both radar operators are attached as inclosure No. 2 and 3.

2. Phenomenon sighted at 1215 CST (1615Z), 24 Dec 52, intermittently for a period of approximately 30 minutes. The exact time (CST) shown on the photographs referenced in paragraph 6 is 1215:39 to 1215:107. These photographs were taken of the AN/APQ-11 indicator "B" and "C" scopes during one of the periods when the AN/APQ-11 radar set was tracking.

3. Phenomenon detected by Radar set similar to AN/APQ-11 w/AIO installed on nose of B-36 equipment flight test aircraft. Phenomenon was detected at same relative position by AN/APS-23. For description of AN/APQ-11 and AIO (C-99/APG antenna control) see TO No. CO AN 16-30APG-11-3. The AN/APQ-11 indicator was equipped with an O-15 camera which photographed the B and C scopes, a data card, a frame counter, and a clock. The data card contains p.1 lights, one indicator which the radar set detects a target. Another is energized when the radar set looks on a target, and another is energized when the Mitchell camera was running. The Mitchell camera was mounted on the nose turret, and boresighted to the tracking line of the AN/APQ-11 antenna. The turret is elevated to the antenna, and follows in azimuth and elevation. Although the light on the O-15 film indicated that the Mitchell camera was running, nothing visually distinctive could be found on the film.

4. Phenomenon observed 10 miles East of Dallas, Texas, to 80 miles Northeast of Dallas North and South heading at 40,000 ft., and descends to 15,000 ft. in the area surrounding Lake Dallas. Phenomenon was no longer detected below altitude of 15,000 ft. Phenomenon was tracked at different azimuth locations plus or minus 300 and minus 50 to minus 15° evaluation. Although no intensive visual search was made phenomenon was not seen by the pilot or any crew member.

The phenomenon was present during the period of time when the B-36 fighters were making simulated attacks against the B-36. It was determined later that the interior performance from the AN/APQ-11 was obviously due, at least partially, to the same type of phenomenon that was detected and tracked for 30 minutes after the fighters left the area to return to their base (Bergstrom AFB).

The AN/APQ-11 operator's signed statement (Incl. 3) and the AN/APS-23 operator's signed statement (Incl. 4) give further details.

5. Both radar operators have been operating and flight testing their respective equipment for several years. Radar set AN/APQ-11 was instrumented with an O-15 camera (described in 3 above). The O-15 film was not clear, but does indicate presence and trackability of phenomenon.

The scope face of the AN/APQ-11 indicator was slightly out of focus, and the pictures that Mr. [redacted], the operator, took in search do not show the phenomenon clearly. A description and sketch of the search presentation of the phenomenon on the "B" scope is included as part of the AN/APQ-11 operator's statement (Incl. 3).

6. Weather conditions. Immediate area was clear, nearest cloud formations were approximately 10 miles distant (at the same altitude). There was a cloud deck below the B-36 at a low altitude.

7. AN/APS-23 presentation of phenomenon was similar to recent AF release of PPI photographs of sightings made over Washington, D. C.

The AN/APS-23 operator's statement gave the details of what he saw on his PPI scope.

8. Photographs of AN/APQ-11 scope are available. These are the G-15 films referred to and discussed in 3 above. These and the Mitchel film referred to in 3 will be retained by Lt. [redacted] and will be available upon his return to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, in February. His office is in the Armament Laboratory, Building 22, Post 28A, Phone 2012l or 2623E, and the office symbol is WCL0L-1.

9. Maneuvers were made by the B-36 aircraft to prove trackability of the phenomenon. By observing the AN/APQ-11 antenna position while tracking the phenomenon it was determined that during the B-36 maneuvers the phenomenon remained on its same apparent course and speed.

The maneuvers consisted of turns, climbs, and dives (to the extent of the B-36's capabilities). The G-11 antenna and turret would move (with respect to the B-36 so near that they pointed towards a point in space traveling a path parallel and more or less coinciding with the path the B-36 had departed from). The phenomenon descended at the same rate as the B-36 and maintained a distance of 2000 to 1000 yards ahead of the B-36. Whenever the B-36 established a new heading so that the phenomenon was entirely out of the search sector of the G-11 antenna, the G-11 would not detect anything for a period of several seconds up to 2 or 3 minutes. Then suddenly the phenomenon would reappear and the G-11 would again detect and lock on it. See the AN/APQ-11 operator's statement (Incl. No. 4) for details.

10. No air traffic was observed in the Dallas area at the time of the electronic sighting.

me as soon as he arrived.

Was the weather good or bad? Certain areas around Dallas had bad weather
on 24 Dec 52.

Weather records from 0900Z at Ft. Worth will be requested from Asheville
Weather Central to determine if temperature inversions or any disturbing
weather phenomenon could have affected the radar sets on the B-36.

An explanation of scope photo can be obtained from WADC - indicated in

(S.A. ALN 1 46,000 FT.)

SUBJECT:
1. Evaluation of Nose Radar System

A total of five nose attacks were made at 30,000 ft. PA. Cursory inspection of the data indicates that either adjustment, detecting medium detection were not adequate, or that the AAA with low nose maneuvers was not a real position. In any event, performance of the system was not indicative for defense of the nose of the airplane.

2. Hydraulic Controller Operational Investigation

Half of the planned tests at 30,000 ft. PA were accomplished on the controllers. He took while firing were observed. From these obtained for the GAL interest only, as the GAL report could not extend.

DISCUSSION:

All other tests were canceled because of unsatisfactory weather conditions as the test.

3. Evaluation of Nose Radar System

The fighter was obtained on an instrument clearance from the base factory daily alternating approximately 50 kilometers for testing, with 5-28, 14-30 and 15-28 flights. Four nose attacks were made at altitudes over 30,000 feet of approximately 250 miles or 600 feet distance, and station equipped with 5,000 yards, with a temporary vector at 4,200 yards from upper 15,000 feet to 50 miles and 50 miles per hour. Vertical acceleration at 4,000 yards at 5,000 yards was made with AAA with 12 indicated the lower closure.

SUBJECT: FLYOBPT

Statement by AN/APG/h1 operator on 24 day December 1952, Convair flight on ship 44-9205h, type B-36

While flight testing AN/APG/h1 radar on nose of B-36 054, 12-22-52, I encountered a spurious target during work with fighter aircraft. Thinking that it might be cloud trouble, I asked pilot (Capt. I. Davis) what kind of cloud cover we had around us. His remarks were "Not a cloud in 10 miles." At this time the fighters were dispatched to return to their base. The spurious target again triggered the ALO and made a very firm look on. At this point I asked the APS-23 operator for confirmation on target. He confirmed that he had seen spurious target at same azimuth position and possibly same range. By this time the target had appeared several times in a pop in and pop out manner at the same range 2000 to 4000 yds but varying in azimuth of 60° to the right or left of the nose of the ship. To assure myself I asked the pilot to maneuver the ship after lock on to prove trackability. This showed target to be very stable and trackable. At this time we had spent some 30 minutes with the target and when we started to descend the target stayed with us down to about 15,000 ft. At this point ground return was triggering my system, and the target was no longer seen. This target did not look like normal return that you get from other aircraft. The only thing that I have ever seen it resemble it was spent 20 Ml shell cases which I have tracked before on the APG/h1 tail system in same ship.

SUBJECT: FLYOBSPT

Statement by AN/APS-23 operator, 24 December 1952, Convair flight on ship 44-92054, type B-36.

The APS-23 with C-112 control in lieu of a computer is used as search radar on this airplane. At the time I was requested to aid in detecting the phenomenon I was in search position 10,000 ft. altitude and 36 mile range. I had previously determined also that in level flight, search condition, the best ground return was obtained with -7 to -9 degree antenna tilt. I then reduced range to the stop position which removed the five mile range mark from the scope, and upon this fact I estimated my maximum range on the scope at 4.5 miles. I next switched to Sector-Scan selecting a 120 degree arc dead ahead and by moving antenna tilt to zero position on scale the described targets began to appear. I then found my best target range from zero to 44 degrees. Since the targets were in the same proximity as the AA/APC-14 had indicated, I did not change altitude. In almost every instance I would see the target on my scope by the time the AA/APC-14 had detected and locked on. The AA/APC-14 operator would call out range of lock on, and my range would be comparable to his. On one occasion I detected a second target further out (approximately one mile), and on several occasions I could see another target 30 to 45 degrees, either side of the one he was locked on. On one occasion I switched back to search picking up the target aft of the airplane, and followed it out of 4.5 mile range. These targets were very sharp and with RF gain could be tuned very bright. However, they were unusual in the fact that they did not track in from the edge of the scope but would appear on the scope at a range of two to four miles. They also might remain constant for several sweeps, and then the next sweep they would be gone. Several sweeps later they might reappear. They would disappear the same time the AA/APC-14 would unlock.

We next checked to see if the two sets were mutually interfering with each other by turning the AA/APS-23 to stand-by position, and alternately turning the AA/APC-11 to stand-by. No interference was observed.

Subject: FLYING SAUCER

(1) Object not seen visually, but tracking data indicates that object was moving in a northwesterly direction at approx. 300 mph. Radar tracking was made with two radars in short-time tracking, on the direction and distance of the object. Tracking was made on B-36 and at approx. the same time on another aircraft. The signal comments & local radar operators confirm these observations.

(2) Visually sighted at 12:15 p.m. intermittently for a period of approximately 30 minutes. Altitude was on photographic references in log (6). Indications B and C were during a period when tracking was made.

(3) Phenomena detected by radar for similar to AN/APS-4 w/ ALO installed on one of B-36 equipment flight test aircraft. Phenomena was detected at some position between KMARS-23. Then description of KMARS, CO AN 16-30 APCS-3, with 16-30 APCS-4 indicated was equipped with an O-15 camera which photographed the B and C scope, a data card and frame counter clock. All data card and frame counter log indicating when the radar got locked on a target and another camera was triggered. Missile camera was mounted on same aircraft.

Miscellaneous comments with more comments on timing and site location is shown of the AN/APS-4 on site. It is placed to the antenna and follows in 15 miles. Though the logger - the O-15 pattern indicated the missile camera was running, unfortunately it was not developed through normal channels and the frame which would have developed this phenomena...

The image appears to be a black and white document or page with a grid/window-like structure in the left portion and a small document/note on the right side.


- page 48 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

0777

There are some other markings and numbers on the right side of the page (such as 24, 12, 6, 10), but the text is very faint and difficult to read with certainty. The document appears to be a black and white scanned page with a grainy, low-contrast appearance.


- page 49 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

0788

There is a small note/section on the right side of the page that appears to have some text, but it is too illegible for me to confidently transcribe. There is also what looks like a curved scale or gauge marking on the right side of the page with some numbers, but the text is not clear enough to read definitively.


- page 50 -

Here is the text I can discern from the image:

0788

On the small white label on the right side of the document, I can partially read:
Act M
Ship 61
Fil 70
(rest is illegible)

There is also a curved line or scale with some numbers on the right side of the image, but the text is too blurry to read clearly.

The document appears to be a black and white scanned page with three hole punches on the left side.


- page 51 -

Text found in the image:

0788

Act. 5
Spt. 57
Ht. 4'8"

There is a curved scale or gauge on the right side of the image with numbers ranging from 0 to 24, and three hole punches are visible on the left side of the document.


- page 52 -

Here is the text I can discern from the image:

0792

On the right side of the image, there is a small box with some text, but it is too blurry/low resolution to read clearly. There is also a partial curved scale or gauge visible on the upper right side of the image.

The document appears to be a black and white scanned page with some holes on the left side, suggesting it was originally hole-punched for filing.


- page 53 -

The image appears to be a black and white technical diagram or schematic. It shows what looks like a ladder-like structure on the left side, a rectangular panel or plate on the right side, and a curved or circular element at the top right. There are several small circular marks or holes visible on the document. The image has a grainy, vintage photographic quality typical of mid-20th century technical documentation. However, no legible text is visible in this image.


- page 54 -

The text in this image is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the black and white scanned document. There are some faint markings and numbers visible, but they cannot be confidently transcribed. The image appears to be a document or form with some horizontal lines and a partial clock or circular diagram in the upper right corner, but the details are too blurry to read clearly.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(6) Weather conditions. Immediate area was clear, nearest closed formations were approx. 10 miles distant. Partly cloudy. Winds light. Cloud deck 14-15 at about 10,000 ft. 8-9 over feet.

(7) NNAPS -23 presentation of phenomenon was similar to recent ATC reports of pickup phenomenon of sighting. Most of sighting, etc. C.

-the details are written in raw in the PPJ logs.

(8) Photographs of NNAPS-41 scope are available. These are the P-15 films referred to in (3) above. These will be available upon his return to WPAFB, Ohio in this building 22 posts 184 points 20121 or 26235 and office of MCGL-1.

(9) Maneuver were made by the B-35 aircraft to prove trackability of the phenomenon. By sharing the NNAPS-41 surface position while tracking the phenomenon it was determined that during its B-35 maneuvers the phenomenon remained in its same apparent course and speed.

The maneuver consisted of turns, climbs, and level (for the purpose of the B-35 expeditiously) to suggest to the B-3 that this ship positioned towards a point in space to coincide with the parallax of the phenomenon as it passed from. The B-35 maneuvered into position as the B-3 and B-35 tracked the phenomenon which a new B-35 to track the B-3 picked up a new heading to better fly out of this.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

search with off the G-41 system. He would not
detect anything for a period of seconds up to 2 or 3 minutes.
Then suddenly the phenomenon would reappear
and the G-41 would again detect and look on its
site. The AN/APS-4 navigation document (incl No. 4) and
(10) The Air Tactile was recorded in the Dallas area
at the time of the electronic sighting.
The pilots and crew members were constantly
searching the area in which the G-41 indicating
the phenomenon was present. If there was anything
pilots and other crew members could not find it.

/4/ PHENOMENON OBSERVED 40 MILES E OF DALLAS TEX TO 80 MILES NE OF DALLAS ON BOTH N AND S HEADINGS AT 42095 FT AND ON DESCENT TO 15000 FT IN THE AREA SURROUNDING LAKE DALLAS. PHENOMENON WAS NO LONGER DETECTED BELOW ALT OF 15000 FT. PHENOMENON WAS TRACKED AT DIS OF 2000 TO 4000 YARDS RANGE APPEARING INTERMITTENTLY AT DIFFERENT AZIMUTH LOCS PLUS OR MINUS 30 DEGREES AND MINUS 5 TO MINUS 15 DEGREE ELEVATION. ALTHOUGH AN INTENSIVE VISUAL SEARCH WAS MADE PHENOMENON WAS NOT SEEN BY THE PLT OR ANY CR/M.

/5/ BOTH RADAR OPRS HAVE BEEN OPRG AND FLT TESTING THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUIP FOR SERVEAL YRS. RADAR SET AN/APG-41 WAS INSTRUMENTED W/ AN O/15 CAMERA. FILM WAS NOT CLEAR BUT DOES INDICATE PRESENCE AND TRACKABILITY OF PHENOMENON.

/6/ WEA CONDITIONS. IMMED AREA WAS CLEAR NEAREST CLOUD FORMATIONS WERE APRX 40 MILES DISTANT.

/7/ AN/APS-23 PRESENTATION OF PHENOMENON WAS SIMILAR TO RECENT AF RELEASE OF PPI PHOTOGRAPHS OF SIGHTINGS MADE OVER WASHINGTON D.C.

/8/ PHOTOGRAPHS OF AN/APG-41 SCOPE ARE AVAL.

/9/ MANEUVERS WERE MADE BY THE B-36 ACFT TO PROVE TRACKABILITY OF THE PHENOMENON. BY OBSERVING THE AN/APG-41 ANTENNA PSN WHILE TRACKING THE PHENOMENON IT WAS DETERMINED THAT DURING THE B-36 MANEUVERS THE PHENOMENON REMAINED ON ITS SAME APPARENT CRSE AND SPEED.

/10/ NO AIR TRF WAS OBSERVED IN THE DALLAS AREA AT THE TIME OF THE ELECTRONIC SIGHTING.
