SATSUNA, AIARA
17 August 1953
Under date of 17 August 1953, Captain Gordon R. Gallep, USAF, 433rd 
Air Base Squadron, advises as follows:
On 17 August 1953 at 0835 hours local time, an object was reported to 
appear from the north, travel in a northwesterly direction, and disappear 
to the south. Witnesses described the object as a bright, fiery glow 
heading from the North to the South. No sound was associated with the 
object. Observers agreed that the object was not an aircraft and 
indicated no flight pattern that could be identified as that of a conven-
tional aircraft. Both observers agreed that the object was within their 
sight for approximately one minute. No further investigation was accom-
plished since the sighting had terminated and there was no need for 
further action. No photographs were taken.
Responsibility of observers is as stated above.
No interception was attempted since the sightings were late in being reported.
The sighting is reported as in Enclosure 77.

STATEMENT OF
SATSUMA, ALABAMA

On 17 August 1953 at 20:55 PM local time, I was standing near Highway 45 approximately 100 yards south of the Dip Store in Satsuma, Alabama. I was looking for the lights of a commercial airliner which I had observed some time earlier. Suddenly, my attention was attracted to the North to the South at an intense rate of speed and in a vertical direction. It was at a fairly high altitude and traveling in a straight and level flight. There was no sound associated with this flight. It appeared to be a bright reddish glow with the duration of sighting lasting approximately three seconds. I did not hear or see any sign of power or any other disturbance in the area at the time of the sighting.

SATSUMA, ALABAMA 

On the night of 1-2 August at approximately 12:30 A.I local time, I was on my way home from Creola, Alabama, on Highway 43, heading south. I was approaching the town of Satsuma, Alabama, when I saw what appeared to be a bright light in the southwest sky. At first I thought it was an object in the sky which I had never seen before. The light was bright and seemed to be rotating or flashing. As I got closer to Satsuma, the light seemed to move closer to me and get brighter. The object was disc-shaped and seemed to be about 20 feet in diameter. There was a red glow around the outer edge of the object. The object appeared to be about 500 feet in altitude. I saw the object for about 1 minute. Then it seemed to move off at a high rate of speed in a westerly direction. There was no sound associated with the object. The night was clear and the stars were visible. I saw no vapor trail and the object made no noise. The object appeared to be disc-shaped and was a bright silvery white color.

Intelligence Officer
July 31, 1953, at approximately 2000-2030 hours local time, Mr. Edward C. Ruppelt, former Chief of the Project BLUE BOOK, was on his way home from work. As he neared his home, he noticed the flying objects. He estimated the objects were about 30-40 feet in diameter and were metallic in appearance. The objects were flying in a circular pattern and then suddenly changed direction. The objects were observed for about 2-3 minutes. The objects were fairly high in the sky and were moving at a fairly high rate of speed. The objects were described as discs and were shiny in appearance. They were associated with a glow and did not resemble any known aircraft. The weather was clear, and visibility was good. The object was located to the northwest of Dayton, Ohio, traveling in a general southwest direction at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet.
On 2 August 1953 at 2230 hours local time, another sighting was reported from Satsuma, Alabama. The witness reported seeing a reddish orange colored light which seemed to come from a flying object at a high altitude. The object made an abrupt change in course, and the witness then lost sight of the object.
On 3 August 1953 at 1530-1710 hours local time, Mr. William Rhodes was sighted by a female witness. The witness reported seeing a metallic object which changed color from white to bright orange and then to a reddish color as it changed altitude and direction. The object appeared to be spinning and then remained stationary. It was observed for about 15-20 minutes.

AERIAL OBJECTS OFFICER
Satsuma Air Force Base, Alabama

The sighting report from the observers indicates that two objects were observed approximately 10,000 feet altitude and traveling in a westerly direction at an estimated speed of about 500 miles per hour. The objects were described as being shaped like little Zippers with a dark belly and a light on top.

On 17 July 1953 between 1900 and 1930 hours, this observer and four other observers at the above location sighted two bright objects in the sky, traveling in a westerly direction. As the objects came closer, they appeared to be two bright lights of considerable size, definitely not aircraft or stars. The objects were observed for approximately 30 minutes, during which time they traveled from a point almost directly north to a point almost directly west, a distance of approximately 50 miles. The course of the objects was from Northeast to Southwest. Altitude of the objects was estimated to be between 10,000 and 12,000 feet, and their speed was estimated to be between 400 and 500 miles per hour.

No interception was attempted since the sightings were late in being reported.

The weather is reported as Inclosure 17.

WORLD SCIENCE REVIEW
SATSUMA 17/18 AUGUST 1953, MEXICO

Mexican Adventure

Flying Saucers are still news. World Science Review is frequently asked to publish articles on this continuous topic and we here give, without comments or necessarily agreement, the author's report on one of the investigations made during a recent tour of the American, where he addressed numerous meetings and spoke on thirty radio and T.V. circuits about flying saucers.

SALVADOR VILLANUEVA is about 5 ft 2 in tall, dark-skinned, 55 years old, and has a wife and seven children. He neither smokes nor drinks, and is respected in his community, being a driver - moving large loads of materials for the building of roads and railways.

For some time he feared to tell of his experience though him described or read (now and then) others have had the phenomenon. One day, however, while delivering some newspaper in the town, a reporter began a series of articles on flying saucers. He used Villanueva`s name as the authority, since that day he has told his story to newspaper reporters, and his accuracy as a reporter. He has come through all dealings all with full marks.

Breakdown
On August 17, 1953, at 7:20 p.m., Villanueva was employed by a people of Texas tourists to drive them from Mexico City to Brayson Border. Everything went well on the trip until they had just passed Monclova, which is about 180 miles from the Border. Suddenly the car began to slow down and finally stopped. Examination showed that it had broken from the differential. The driver said that the car would go no further and that it would be necessary to get a lift.

The Texans were angry. They demanded immediate help. Villanueva said he would summon help and stepped out of the car. He became aware that he had company - two strange men were already by his car. They were good-looking and much taller than he, perhaps over 6 ft in height. They had bright blue eyes, light hair and fine features. Villanueva asked whether he could help them.

"Yes, we have come near here to invite the two visitors to shelter with him in the car." When they were inside they continued the conversation:

"Where do you come from, if I may ask?"
"We come far - very far!"
And they smiled.
Still before there was nothing wrong
until, as the night descended, his strange new friends showed by their manner that they were much too nervous for an ordinary man, not only their world but ours. The spoke of things that he had never heard before. And people that made Villanueva a little disturbed, hurriedly at a question that was creeping into his mind.

"Are we not of this planet? We come from one far distant. But we have come to help you."

Of course, he did not believe them right away. At first he felt they were mad. But the second man's smile told him. Several minutes later during the night he came to the conclusion they were telling the truth. By the time dawn broke he was a very confused man.

Invitation
After sunrise, his companions said they would take him to their spacecraft. He said he would like to see them, since he was still hardly believing, hoping to find a conventional airplane or vehicle and them. They led him away through the bushes and suddenly the ground gave way beneath his feet, and he was sinking into muddy people. Sometimes almost to his knees. But he made no effort to get free. They kept a firm grasp on each of his arms.

After a while they stopped and the feeling that he was approaching something invisible became very strong. Suddenly, the ground gave way entirely, and to his great astonishment, there stood, a magnificent silvery craft, shaped like two saucers joined together. It was enormous.

His companions smiled and invited him aboard. He hesitated only a moment, then followed them into the craft, through an opening which appeared and closed behind him. Once inside, he was taken to a room where he was interviewed at length. The men in front of him seemed to understand his tongue perfectly, though he could not understand theirs. They showed him many things that left him utterly amazed.

After about three hours, during which his strange hosts had explained many things to him, they escorted him back to the place where they had first met him. As they reached the spot, the craft rose silently into the air and disappeared from sight.

Villanueva stood alone, stunned and wondering what had happened to him. He retraced his steps, found his car, and drove it to the nearest town. There he told his story, but it was received with ridicule and disbelief. However, the next day, the two visitors returned and he invited them to his home, where they stayed with him for two days. When they left, they gave him a small object, a souvenir, he says, and assured him that they would return.

JULY 
WORLD SCIENCE REVIEW

When I visited New Mexico in Nov-
ember 1949, I sought out the group
of journalists and investigators who
had been probing Villanueva's
thoroughly since the occurrence.
They were most helpful and arranged
for me to have a long talk with the
man. I could interview him person-
ally, give me every information
he chose to trust to me - a most
being. the kind of man you would
trust to talk to you frankly for a
serious matter. And if you were
if suddenly called away, I liked him
very much, and I thoroughly believe
his story.

That I am not alone. All who have
investigated him have come to the
same conclusion. On one occasion
Mr. and Mrs. Chet Barker came from
California to see him, and they, too,
cum with a group of investigators
and journalists, to find nothing to
take of control. They had to pull
in beside the road where he had
parked his broken-down car, and
set up with his stick the fine of
the ship take off.

Landing Place Discovered
The party followed this line until
they came across a landing place with
burned grass and four deep holes
down by some heavy objects within a
circle, crushed by these objects. At
one point on the farther line they
moved the stick about fifteen degrees.
And when they resumed the measurements, it moved to a new point in a
direction, it studied the line of sight
carefully and maintained the stick on
the new point. It was quite clear that
it was observing the stick move, and
because it had passed the exact
measurement which indicated its line
of approach, it moved the stick to
appear on false-off.

We could not photograph it, but I
had a chance to see them demonstrate for
myself when we took the measurements. 

bar on which the wheels were
not, for most afraid run.from, were
a man, his family, his job.
ng the things he knew to be
uld rather die than do. And
as he would to afraid to leave them,
ouble they might bring.

He could hardly believe what had
happened to him!

The landing place they discovered
shows that Villanueva was telling the
truth. Another man in Mexico has since
then had a more amazing experience.

When I first sighted the object I could see plainly that it was round, gold colored, and apparently metallic. There were flashes of light coming from it, which seemed to indicate it was revolving or rotating. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. As it approached I could see that it was definately a solid object, and not just a reflection or mirage. It seemed to be at an altitude of about 2000 feet, and was moving at a terrific speed, perhaps 600 to 800 mph. As it came nearer I could see that it was shaped like two saucers, one inverted on top of the other. There seemed to be a band or outer ring that was revolving or spinning around the center. The whole object was silent as it moved across the sky. After it had passed over I lost sight of it as it disappeared towards the southwest. It was in sight for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. I am convinced that this was no conventional aircraft, but an unidentified flying object of unusual design and performance.

CRAIG W. HEWARD LETTER

In the first instance the object appeared to be headed in a horizontal flight before the investigator could observe. It then made a vertical ascent at such a tremendous rate of speed that the observer was unable to keep it in sight very long as it passed out of his vision behind clouds. The sighting was at approximately 6:15 PM CST on 28 July 1953 in the vicinity of Satsuma, Alabama. The object itself appeared to be round and silvery in color, and the observer stated that a momentary flash of light was observed from the object which gave the appearance of a 'mirror-like' reflection just prior to its vertical ascent and disappearance. No engine or exhaust was observed, and the object made no sound. The observer, although startled by the unexpected appearance and rapid disappearance of the object, remained calm and collected his thoughts during the brief observation period. He is a mature and intelligent person, and his report is considered credible.

Dear Mr. Hilbert:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 13 February 1953 concerning unidentified flying objects and the correspondence analysis of metallic fragments by the Bendix Aviation Corporation.

The persons who sent these fragments to the Bendix Corporation identified them as fragments from a flying object.

The Bendix Corporation did not identify them as part of a flying saucer or object.

"I don't know what to think. This thing is happening! There is a great brilliance approaching parallel with the horizon. It follows a zig-zag course and then began to slow down and disappear. This was the signal of a space ship from another world. We had contented ourselves that this was perhaps the signal of an experimental aircraft. It was suddenly near us, we wondered. Did they, the signal, come from the other group calling us? They, too, had made contact with an enormous illuminating object maneuvering just over the horizon parallel with the earth. A member of the other group also had seen the bright light in the sky. When both groups were together, a messenger - a space ship - would approach us around their object and then it would vanish again. As it drew near us, it appeared as a solid disk over the gulf. It seemed to be intelligently controlled with perfect maneuvers. A light glowed around it and it suddenly disappeared. One even watched it leave us.
'We were dazed and confused. From meeting world, it was apparent if they had a desire to be friendly, theirs must be a different life than ours. But then, if they had a desire to be hostile, our lives would be in great danger. We experienced a feeling of mixed emotions during the craft's approach, and each time the object would mysteriously disappear and reappear, we became more tense. This time it hovered. What strange life forms inhabit this craft no one can determine.'

Dear Captain Wallace W. Elwood

Received your letter of May 9, 1957 containing a news release dated December 29, 1952 concerning information on UFO's. I certainly was glad to receive it. All the time I have been studying these collated studies I spent gathering UFO information which pertains to sightings that would be of interest to you. I have a few questions and some of the continuing questions are just a few that I would like answered concerning what the Air Force considers on these sightings.

1. What was the object chased by Captain Thomas P. Mantell Jr. and his two wingmen Lt. A. W. Clements and Lt. B. L. Hammond over Kentucky on January 7, 1948 that ended in Capt. Mantell's death?

2. What was the Air Force's explanation of the "Montana Montana" sighting on August 15, 1950 by Pan American airways?

3. What was the Air Force's explanation of the "Tremonton Movie" taken on July 2, 1952 by Warrant Officer Delbert Newhouse?

4. What were the objects that flew over Washington D.C., during the months of July 1952?

5. What is the Air Force's explanation of the seven objects observed and photographed and the 51 passengers aboard their British Overseas Airways Constellation on June 29, 1954 near Goose Bay, Labrador?

6. Why did the objects vanish into the larger ship when approach made to investigate the strange escort?

7. What was the little object that zipped through the town streets of East Lyme Haven, Connecticut and pierced a steel billboard and vanished into the sky on August 15, 1952?

8. What are the "green fireballs" so often observed in the western portion of the United States?

Gentlemen:

I am writing you in reference to some residual material which was recovered from a UFO which exploded at Trancas Beach, Brazil during September 1957. I believe Major Tack has forwarded our initial correspondence concerning this matter.

A misunderstanding concerning AFR 200-2 which we entertained earlier has been clarified and we are ready to work with a basic for cooperation. We are enclosing the current issue of our Bulletin which delivers on some of the specific terms. A technical report of a very thorough nature is being prepared by Dr. von Broen and will be finished if you wish. We will forward a copy for your information when completed.

In addition to the Trancas UFO, we have some residual material which was recovered from a UFO incident in 1955 near Satsuma, Alabama where a UFO penetrated it. Can you obtain some information as to what this material is? If not, would you like some of our experts to take a look at it?

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
Director

1. Reference attached letter with enclosed current issue of APRO Bulletin to APRC from Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, dated 20 April 1960.

2. ATIC is interested in any physical evidence or data which will assist in determining the nature of the phenomena. It is requested that APRO furnish a sample of the material and the technical report concerning the incident described in the bulletin. This material should be forwarded to ATIC as soon as possible.

3. A search of reference material in the ATIC technical library failed to reveal the name of the organization or the article on the incident carried in the APRO Bulletin.

4. For your information, the details of the Satsuma sighting closely resemble those of the incidents of a similar nature which took place on Santa Rosa Island, Florida, on 23 June 1952. However, the fact that the Satsuma incident is claimed to be a hoax should be borne in mind.

5. ATIC files reveal no record of the New Haven, Connecticut case mentioned in the APRO Bulletin. This case would be relatively unreliable, and probably quite useless.

DETAILED SIGHTING REPORT - SATSUMA, ALABAMA
DATB OF REPORT: 25 August 1953
On the night of 25 August 1953, at approximately 2020 hours, a group of local residents of Satsuma, Alabama, observed a bright light in the sky. The light was first observed in the northeast and was observed traveling in a southwesterly direction. The light was described as being brilliant in color and approximately the size of a basketball. It was observed for approximately 4 to 5 minutes.

The Investigating Officer of the 17073rd AIS conducted an investigation and obtained the following statements from the observers:

On 25 August 1953, at approximately 2020 hours, a group of local residents of Satsuma, Alabama, observed a bright light in the sky. The light was first observed in the northeast and was observed traveling in a southwesterly direction. The light was described as being brilliant in color and approximately the size of a basketball. It was observed for approximately 4 to 5 minutes.

The witnesses stated that the object appeared to be slightly oval in shape and that it was emitting a pulsating light, changing in intensity. There was no sound associated with the object. The object was observed to ascend gradually and then disappear in the distance.

The observers were certain that the object was not an aircraft or any other known object. The Air Force investigation could not positively identify the object observed.

CONCLUDING REMARKS: This sighting is considered to be of significant interest due to the number of witnesses, the clarity of the sighting, and the fact that the object could not be identified by the Air Force investigation.
