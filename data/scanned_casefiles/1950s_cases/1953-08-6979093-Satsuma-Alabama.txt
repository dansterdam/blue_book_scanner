We were looking for the Little Dipper when we saw this object East of the highway. It was traveling in a direction from the North to the South at an intense rate of speed and in my estimation exceeded by far the speed of a jet aircraft. It was at a fairly high altitude and traveling in straight and level flight. There was no sound associated with the object. It appeared to be a bright reddish glow with the duration of sighting lasting approximately three seconds. I did not hear or see any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.

STATEMENT OF
SATSUMA, ALABAMA

On the night of 1-2 August at approximately 12:30 AM local time, I was on my way home from Creola, Alabama, on highway 43, heading south, I was approaching the area of Gunnison Creek between Creola and Satsuma, Alabama, when I saw an object in the sky East of the highway. To me the object had a curved landing, and when I came to a stop it seemed to be distinct in shape. The rest of the object appeared to rear to the rear to a point with the entire object glowing in amber color. One object was all that was sighted, and a beacon light was on the South at an intense rate of speed. There was no sound associated with the object, and it did not resemble a star or a meteor. The object was fairly large in size and was not best to my knowledge at approximately 2-3000 feet in altitude. I saw the object for what seemed to be only a few seconds then disappeared to the South paralleling the highway. There is also a beacon light located in the area, but I can definitely state that it was not connected with the object. The weather was clear with no moon with many bright stars.

Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama

SUBJECT: At approximately 1900 CST, 26 August 1953, the 1702d ATC Intelligence Officer was notified by the MATS Intelligence Officer of the report of five sightings which occurred in the vicinity of Evergreen, Alabama, by Messrs. Fred Hale, John Bethel, Jr., C. W. Mathison, Mr. Yell and Roy Hartley, and Mrs. Willie Hughes. The dates of the sightings were from 31 July 1953 through 17 August 1953, inclusive.

The Intelligence Officer of the 1702d ATC conducted an investigation and obtained the following statements from the observers:

Listow, a grocer in Creola, Alabama, was on his way home from Creola working North on Highway 43, when in sighted the flying object. The object appeared in his field of vision through the windshield of his vehicle from the Southwest, crossed his line of vision and disappeared to the Northeast. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and an extremely high altitude. The object was a bright, fluorescent color and duration of sighting was for only a few seconds. No sounds were associated with the glow and did not appear to resemble a meteor or a shooting star. The location of the observer at the time of the sighting was in Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 56 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 32 minutes West. Reliability 3-3.

On 1 August 1953 at 2030 hours local time, Mrs. Ann Belle Dieter was getting into her vehicle when she sighted the flying object. This object was on the west side of Navy field near Evergreen, Alabama, and was traveling at a high speed. She could not estimate the altitude other than stating that it was at a fairly high altitude and that the object was not too far away from where she was standing. She distinctly saw a bright, colored object, appearing to be a golden color in the leading part and a dull amber color in the remaining part. Light did not resemble a meteor or a shooting star and no sound was associated with this light. Duration of the sighting could not have lasted over a few seconds. Location of the observer at the time of the sighting was in Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 56 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 32 minutes West. Reliability 3-3.

On 2 August 1953 at 0930 hours local time, Mr. C. W. Mathison, Methodist Preacher, was on his way home from Creola to Semmes, Alabama when he sighted the flying object. It showed an amber color overall with the brightest glow on the leading edge. When impressed by the brightness of a bright central and gave the appearance blurred and tapered toward the rear. The object was heading from the north to the south in straight and level flight, parallel to highway 43, on the east side. As a high altitude, Southwest track was noted. Individual stated he has knowledge of Meteorology and that the object was neither a meteor nor a shooting star. Observer did not see or have any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. Location of the observer at the time of sighting was at Goulson Creek, approximately one mile south of Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 32 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 32 minutes West. Reliability 3-3.

On 3 August 1953 at 1630-1700 hours local time, Mrs. Willie Hughes was sitting in her back yard at her home in Evergreen, Alabama, who observed the object. She appeared to be looking up to a point at the top of the sky and noticed a bright object. It was moving slowly and giving the appearance of a circular motion. The object appeared to be stationary at times and then giving the appearance of spinning. Object appeared fairly large due to the high altitude.

WORLD SCIENCE REVIEW
Sighting 17/18 August 1953, MEXICO

Mexican Adventure
By Desmond Leslie

Flying Saucers are still news. World Science Review is frequently asked to publish articles on this contentious topic and we here give, without comment or necessarily agreeing with the opinions expressed, the author's report on one of the investigations made during a recent tour of the Americas, where he addressed numerous meetings and spoke on thirty radio and T.V. circuits about flying saucers.

SALVADOR VILLANUEVA IS ABOUT forty years old. He has a wife and seven children. He neither smokes nor drinks and is well respected in his Mexico City home.

By trade he is a driver, earning a car which he plies for hire mainly to tourists.

For some time he feared to tell of his strange experience lest people thought him deceitful or mad (how often have we heard this fear expressed!) But when the Mexican papers began a series of articles on flying saucers, he took courage and wrote to the journalist concerned asking for an interview. Since that day he has been subjected to all manner of tests for his integrity and accuracy as a reporter. He has come through them all with full marks.

Breakdown
Between August 17-19, 1953, Villanueva was employed by a couple of Texan tourists to drive them from the Texan Border, Mexico City to the Texan Border. After covering about sixty miles successively, they had just passed Cuidad Valley when horrible noises came from the crankshaft and the car ground to a halt. Examination showed that oil had leaked from the differential and it soon became obvious that the car would go no further, not that night at any rate.

The Texans were angry. They unloaded their baggage, engaged another car and drove off without paying. Villanueva tried to obtain help but was unsuccessful. By then it was beginning to rain so he decided there was nothing for it but to spend the night in his car and make arrangements for repairs in the morning.

A little later, about six p.m., he crawled under the car to look at the damage, in the faint hope that he might do something to help. Suddenly he became aware that he had

Small Men
Right by his nose were two pairs of feet. The feet and the legs—what he could see of them from his prone position—were normal except that they were encased in a substance like seamless grey corduroy.

Scrambled up to find himself face to face with a couple of pleasant-looking men no more than four feet high. Now, in Mexico, there are many short people. Many of the peasants do not exceed four and a half feet. So Villanueva was not unduly alarmed. He noticed they were both clad from neck to the tips of their toes in this one-piece grey material, broken only by a wide belt and shiny black. Round their necks they were metal collars and, on the back of their necks a small black shiny box.

Under their arms they carried implements similar to those worn by jet pilots or American football players, so he assumed them to be some kind of aviators who had landed nearby.

The men opened the conversation:
"Are you having trouble?"
"Yes," answered the driver, "my differential gas broken, as far as I can see."

Odd Accent
The man who addressed him smiled sympathetically and spoke of one or two casual things. He asked Villanueva a little about himself, and he seemed quite friendly. The driver, however, noticed that this man had a peculiar accent as though he seemed to be stringing words together. His companion said nothing, but occasionally smiled or made other expressions.

Villanueva asked: "Doesn't your friend speak Mexican?" but he is able to understand

JULY                    WORLD SCIENCE REVIEW

Flying Saucer photographed by George [illegible], California, 1951. This is probably the most discussed [illegible] Nature is small.

The " Sauces "
    Suddenly they came out into a kind of clearing. There it stood, a great shiny craft unlike anything the simple Mexican had ever seen. In form it had the shape of two huge saucp plates joined at the rim. Above it was a shallow dome with portholes.

    The entire structure, about forty feet across, rested on three giant metal spheres or landing balls. Unless this was some secret invention from the United States, it was surely a ship from another world.

    As they approached a faint humming came from within the craft and a portion of the lower hull opened outwards, much in the manner of the rear entrance to a D.C.-3, so that the inner side of the panel formed a staircase to the craft and the supporting cables became handrails.

    The two men went up the short flight of steps, pausing on the top to turn and look at their earthly companion.

    "Would you care to come inside with us ?" [illegible] the invitation.

    Villanueva could only shake his head. His wife, his family, his job, his home and all the things he knew and loved suddenly seemed very real. No, he would be afraid to leave them for something alien and totally beyond his understanding.

    [rest of text is partially illegible]

A Reliable Man
    When I visited Mexico in November, 1951, I sought out the group of journalists and investigators who had been probing Villanueva thoroughly since the occurrence. They were most helpful and arranged a meeting with an interpreter at which I could interview him personally. He gave me every impression of being a trustworthy reliable human being, the kind of man you would trust to take your jewellery to a bank or to look after your children if suddenly called away. I liked him very much, and I thoroughly believe his story.

    But I am not alone. All who have investigated him have come to the same conclusion. On one occasion Mr. and Mrs. Charles Reeves, ardent researchers from Ohio, took Villanueva with a group of investigators and journalists to find and establish the place of contact. They found the pull-in beside the road where he had parked the broken-down car, and after a little recollection Villanueva set up with his stick the line of direction where he remembered seeing the ship take off.

Landing Place Discovered
    The party followed this line until they came across a clearing where bushes and sticks had been broken down by some heavy object within a circle roughly 40-50 feet in diameter. Later, one of the party secretly moved the stick about fifteen degrees, and when they rejoined the road, asked Villanueva to re-confirm the direction. He studied the line of sight carefully and moved the stick back about fifteen degrees to its original position. He was quite certain, he said, that this was the true direction because he had noted the exact background in the distant landscape against which the saucer had first appeared on take-off.

    Now such powers of observation may seem remarkable. But I had a chance to see them demonstrated for myself when we took the mountain roads. At times our wheels were but a few inches from the edge. But I never felt afraid for I sensed that here was a man who knew exactly what he was doing and whose sight and judgment were above average.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

When I showed him the photos
of the Martians, he said that
though it was similar to his ship
there were some differences,
for example, the wide convex hull
and the round nacelle. He did
not know the names of the Martians. They were small and clad in
the typical space-man covering.
He had the impression, though,
that they did not name any planet, that
they had come from somewhere much
further than Venus, maybe from
what he called a "cosmic eddy."

I asked him to give me the "key"
by that I mean that every man who
has evolved a type and physical
configuration has some other world
has a certain "key" to his origin,
wherein it will be known that he is
speaking truth. No man, though he
lived a hundred years, could ever
state - very few men on
this planet, even in a simple country-
man's mind, had spoken
truth he could not
have been only a
"key" but at least claiming
to have some neurotic
reason.

This is a scene of the kind of warm kind

not know what to think.
    "Then it happened!
    "Exactly as I had described, a white globe
with great brilliance appeared parallel with
the horizon. It followed a zig-zag path for
quite a distance and then began to slow
down and disappear.
    "At last we had done it! This was the
signal of a space ship from another world.
We had established contact!"
    "Had the other group made contact?" We
wondered. Did they see the signal too?
    "As we approached the car, we heard the
group calling us. They, too, had made contact. They knew it was a signal.
    "The most amazing thing, however, was
that a member of the other group also had
received a telepathic message that a signal
would come at eleven o'clock."
    "When both groups were together, a
thought seemed to prevail unanimously—
a space ship would appear at around
eleven o'clock."
    "Our group looked back to their places
again. We wondered if a space ship
would come."
    "The time was 10:50 P.M. Shortly a glowing object appeared over the gulf. It
came closer, and performed some unique
maneuvers. It had appeared at exactly the
same place where the signal was last seen.
    "On and on. We finally were able
to see only a few miles on it. It had a dome
and flat bottom. We saw no longer felt the cold
wind nor the roar of the gulf."
    "It was a space ship from another world!"
    "It was not coming toward us, however,
but was approaching the car. We would
have to start for the car we chose would
meet the ship there.
    "As we moved rapidly for the car, something happened. The space ship was now
moving away. Gradually it disappeared
from sight. Our hopes fell. But then we
turned. Down the beach a car was now
approaching.
    "Several times during the craft's approach,
automobiles came into sight down the beach,
and each time none of the occupants would
only see its luminosity.
    "Then the vehicle again came nearer—and
then it hovered. This time it did not lose its
luminosity. A car was coming down the
beach. We couldn't understand why the
object did not again disappear.

lights on. It was the State Highway Patrol;
Our first thought was to keep them from
seeing the object, so John McCoy and David
Piller walked over to the left side of the
car hoping to block their view of the
object. At the same time I ran over to the
driver's side. A highway patrolman was
driving. Inside with him were two deputy
sheriffs.
    "The officer asked what we were
doing. (And I shall have to admit that we
were a bit suspicious looking with the long
overcoats and no fishing tackle or the like.)
"We are conducting experiments," I replied.
    "What kind of experiments?"
    "Scientific experiments," I told him.
    "All three officers got out. They marched
to the front of the car. Leaping their
eyes constantly upon us. I hope I will be
forgiven at this point if I do not go into
a description of the words and thoughts
that transpired during the next few minutes.
I did get one definite impression, however,
and it was that it would not be very long
before they had us in the car if we did
not tell them what we were doing.
    "So I told them: 'If you really want to
know what we are doing, we came out
already made contact. In fact, and here I
pointed to the space ship, which was hovering behind and to the right of them, 'you
can see it hovering there right now.'
    "They did not laugh. They did not even
crack a smile. They were too startled at such
an amazing sight.
    "One of our group handled the highway
patrolman John's part of the binoculars. The
officer walked over to the side of the car
and leaned on it. He stared at the saucer
for fifteen or twenty minutes. I have never
seen anyone so amazed. Then patrolman,
Don Floyd, cut off the lights of the patrol
car. The window next to him was open, but
he did not even move his eyes or binoculars off the craft for one second—he just
reached through the window and cut the
lights off.
    "Several times while he was viewing it
through the binoculars, some of us would go
and talk to him, but he would not answer.
    "As some of us were talking to Deputy
Roy Floyd, Don, with some excitement that
the object had a dome on top and was flat
on the bottom. He had assured him that he

Dear Sirs!

A time ago I asked for information on a affair. You said that not even a minute fragment of a so-called fly-saucer was ever found. I have that statement under the Division of Bombardiation Corp. Trenton, New Jersey has some fragment of a fly-saucer that crashed through a signboard in New Haven Conn. I also have proof of this on 2 sheets of paper. Could you explain why you sent this? I would like you to send more information on this. What I need more than anything else is a picture - a color print and what place?

me and?

I have heard about people going to other planets or have at least gone into outer space. I would like you to explain how you feel about this. I would appreciate it very much if you would do this for me.

Very truly yours,

Dear Captain Wallace W. Elwood

Received your letter of May 9, 1957 containing a news release dated October 25, 1957 concerning information on UFO's. I certainly was glad to receive it. All the time I have left from my college studies I spend gathering UFO material. From my study of many sightings I would like a few questions answered concerning some of the reported unknown observations. The following questions are just a few that I would like answered concerning what the Air Force's conclusions are on these sightings.

1. What was the object chased by Captain Thomas F. Mantell Jr. and his two wingman Lts. A. W. Clements and Lts. B. A. Hammond near Kentucky on January 7, 1948 that ended in Capt. Mantell's death?

2. What was the Air Force's explanation of the "Montana Movie" taken on August 15, 1950 by ________

3. What was the Air Force's explanation of the "Tremonton Movie" taken on July 2, 1952 by Warrant Officer Delbert O. Newhouse?

4. What were the objects that flew over Washington D. C., during the month of July 1952?

5. What is the Air Force's explanation of the seven objects observed by Captain _________ and eleven crew members and the 51 passengers aboard their British Overseas Airways Corps. Stratocruisers, The Centaurus on June 30, 1954 near Goose Bay, Labrador?

6. Why did the objects vanish into the larger ship when sabrejets approached to investigate the strange escort?

7. What was the little object that soared through the down town straits of East New Haven, Connecticut and pierced a metal billboard and vanished into the sky on August 19, 1952?

8. What are the "Green Fireballs" so often observed in the western portion of the United States?

Gentlemen:

I am writing you in reference to some residual material which was recovered from a UFO which exploded and burned at Ubatuba Beach, Brazil during September 1957. I believe Major Tack has forwarded our initial correspondence concerning the matter.

A misunderstanding concerning AFR 200-2 which we entertained temporarily has now been dispelled and we are ready to work out a basis for cooperation. We are enclosing the current issue of our bulletin which gives an account of the Ubatuba incident in general terms. A technical report of a very thorough nature is being prepared by Dr. ████. We will forward a copy to your office when it is finished if you wish. This should furnish you with the enough background to enable you to decide what more can be done in the way of analysis. May we have your comments and/or suggestions.

In addition to the Ubatuba mg, we have some residual material which was left imbedded in a sightcard in New Haven, Connecticut in 1959 when a 1950 penetrated it. Was this incident investigated by ATIC? Was ATIC able to obtain some of the material for examination? If not, would you like some of ours?

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
Director

It is suggested that APRO be requested to forward a sample of the material and the technical report concerning the [redacted] case so ATIC. The names and specific qualifications of the persons involved in the analysis should accompany the report.

3. A search of reference material in the ATC technical library failed to reveal the names of [redacted], Dr [redacted], or any of the persons mentioned in the article on the incident carried in the APRO Bulletin.

4. For your information, the details of the Ubatuba Beach sighting closely parallel the circumstances of a case which took place near Maury Island, Wash. on 21 June 1947. This case is discussed on page 431 of the book [redacted] by [redacted] and [redacted]. The Air Force conclusion is that the Maury Island case was probably a hoax.

5. ATIC files reveal no record of the New Haven, Connecticut case referenced in the APRO letter. This case is approximately seven years old and any information which could be derived at this late stage would be relatively unreliable and probably quite useless.

FROM: Acting Intelligence Officer
Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama

REPORT NO.

Details: At approximately 1900 CST, 25 August 1953, the 17092nd Intelligence Officer was notified by the FCIC Intelligence Officer of the report of five separate unidentified flying objects observed by Mr. [redacted], Mrs. [redacted], and Mr. [redacted]. The dates of the sightings were from 31 July 1953 through 17 August 1953, inclusive.

The Intelligence Officer of the 17092nd Wing conducted an investigation and obtained the following statements from the observers:

On 31 July 1953 at approximately 2000-2030 hours local time, Mr. [redacted], a grocer in Satsuma, Alabama, on his way home from driving North, was on Highway 43, when he sighted five objects in the sky. While driving, he pulled over to the side of the road, got out of his vehicle through the windshield of his vision. The objects were southwest, grouped in a wing and disappeared to the Northwest. The object was traveling at a fairly high altitude and a brightly lit object. The color was white and duration of sighting was for only a few seconds. No contrails were associated with the glow and did not appear to resemble a meteor or a cloud. Location of sighting: North of Satsuma, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 46 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 32 minutes West. Visibility 5-2.

On 1 August 1953 at 2230 hours local time, Mr. [redacted] was getting into her vehicle near the sighted site flying over her way to Satsuma, from the Northwest, at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to be at a fairly high altitude and was so bright that the object was not too far away from her. The color was white and appeared to be a meteor or a blowing star and no sound was associated with the two lights. Duration of the sighting was instantaneous. Location of the observer at the time of the sighting was in Satsuma, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 46 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 32 minutes West. Visibility 5-2.

On 2 August 1953 at 0030 hours local time, Mr. [redacted], Postmaster, was on his way home from Satsuma to Citronelle, Alabama was he sighted the flying object. The object was traveling from the Northwest, spreading edge which appeared to be curved like the circumference of a basketball and gave the appearance blurred and tapered toward the rear. The object was heading from the Northwest to the South. It was sighted on the East side at a high altitude. Subject stated that he could not estimate altitude so he guessed that it was 6-8000 feet high. It appeared to be fairly large in size with no sound associated. Speed was estimated to be much faster than the jet aircraft seen in this area. Individual stated he has knowledge of meteorology and that the object was neither a meteor nor a shooting star. Observer did not give any estimate of the size at the time of the sighting. Location of sighting: Satsuma, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 46 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 32 minutes West. Visibility 5-2.

On 2 August 1953 at 1630-1730 hours local time...
