"DOUBT OVER CRASH CAUSE
Driver Tells Police a Flying Saucer Blinds Him

"A flying saucer was reportedly seen in Kansas City, Kansas, early today," police are investigating reports that indicate: 

"A 33 years old, ____ Kansas Avenue, he told police, when this flying saucer or a ball of fire or something like that" flashed across his car. He lost control of his car and crashed into a truck parked at the curb, damaging both vehicles.

"He suffered cuts on his head and face and was treated at the police emergency hospital and arrested for drunken driving: while intoxicated. The truck was owned by Thomas E. HABLE of Edwardsville, KS."

I make this statement to LAWRENCE A. APPLEBY, to whom I know to be a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, United States Air Force.

On January 6, 1950 at 7:50 P.M., an employee of mine and myself left our place of work. As we walked toward our car we noticed a very brilliant object in the sky sending out a very good reflection. At first glance it seemed like a star but on second notice we were positive it was an airborne object visible to both of us and some other sources. This object was a very brilliant white and flickered some what like a star. It seemed to hover in one position at the center of the object and steady at times. The outer edge was sometimes the color of fire and at other times you would see a bright flash as it passed in front of your eyes. This said the object was about constant but would be seen at intervals of nearly five to twenty-five minutes of sighting.

As to the shape or size of the object it would be hard to say definitely. The brilliant color was round and seemed to double in size, estimating its distance at 50 miles and height 5000 to 4000 feet, it was six to eight inches in diameter. Speeding back and forth it seemed to hover for periods of about ten minutes at a time, gradually descending in altitude of about 5000 to 4000 feet continued west, southwest. At first sighting estimated the speed not over 10,000 feet.

After sighting the object from the parking lot in front of our plant we drove about ten or twelve miles south to a high point. We kept it in sight up to this time and then watched it for about ten minutes. During this time the object seemed to hover. We noticed it was visible only the color flickerings, and the red flashes continuing. Then it started moving in a southwesterly direction, at this time we drove back over the same route and kept it in sight half the way back then it disappeared. We continued to observe and try to obtain sighting again, but it appeared no more. At another high point and the object was not visible. The object also was not comparable to an airplane, dirigible or balloon of any type. As to the length of time of sighting it was approximately twenty five to thirty minutes.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION 
TITLE: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON 
22 JANUARY 1950
LOCATION: KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI (27-21-30)

SYNOPSIS: This is an Initial Report.

Investigation was initiated by the District Commander, 13th OSI District. According to the report, a person in Kansas City, Missouri reported sighting an unconventional aircraft at 12:26 hours on 22 January 1950. The object was described as being bright white and of a peculiar shape. The object was observed for several minutes as it hovered in one position and then suddenly disappeared. The object was a brilliant white and a bright red flash was observed from the outer edge of the object. The rod-like flash was not constant but would be silently interrupted. Speed could not be estimated. The object appeared to hover in one position for a period of time, after which it suddenly disappeared. No motion or sound was detected. The document concluded that the object observed was not due to any airplanes, dirigibles, or balloons of any type.

UNCLASSIFIED

1. Investigation was initiated by the District Commander, 13th OSI District, upon receipt of information that an unconventional aircraft was sighted on 6 January 1950. (Raytown) Kansas City, Missouri, had sighted an unconventional aircraft on 6 January 1950.

AT KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI

2. On 9 January 1950 1/Sgt MACARTHUR of the Provost Marshal's Office, KAAP, Kansas: telephoned and advised this office that a "Flying Saucer" had been sighted on 7 January 1950, at about 1930 hours.

Investigation revealed that the unconventional aircraft resided at the Bendix (Raytown) Kansas City plant and that the persons employed at the Bendix Aircraft Corporation, 95th and Troost Street, Kansas City, Missouri, had sighted the object.

3. On 10 January 1950 Mr. BOO was interviewed at the Bendix Plant. Mr. BOO stated that on 6 January 1950, he and an employee of the Bendix plant punched the time clock at the Bendix Plant at 1926 hours and left the building to go the main entrance. He went on to say that as they emerged from the building and walked across the street, they noticed what appeared to be a star but closer observation convinced them that what they were viewing was an unconventional craft or some type. He described the object as being round in shape, although "no definite lines pertaining to shape were visible". He stated that it was brilliant white and that a bright red glow surrounded the object. This red glow was observed from the center of the object from time to time and at other times from the outer edge of the object. This red glow was not constant. He estimated that the object was in view for approximately 5 to 8 minutes and that its size appeared to be 4 to 6 inches in diameter. Its speed could not be estimated and it appeared to hover in one position for a period of 10 to 15 minutes. He noticed that the color flickered and the red flashes continued. This was observed from THEIR vantage point. According to Mr. BOO, two men had traveled to obtain a better view. From this point, according to Mr. BOO, the beacon of the object could be seen and the outline of the object was more clearly defined. The two men had proceeded to a high point southeast of the Bendix Plant but did not see the object again. They then proceeded to a high point southeast of the Bendix Plant but did not see the object again.

concurred in __ statements and added that the object they had sighted appeared to swirl or rotate at a terrific speed. He stated that there had been no motion but that it had, except for the period of revolving, moved continuously away from them. He estimated that its altitude was 5,000 to 10,000 feet but that it went on to say that he thought when he had first sighted the object that it almost white color. He said that it was a reddish rings encircled the object, one at the regular intervals it appeared to be turning or oscillating, and diffuse the entire object with a reddish glow. According to his statement, but he could give no estimate of this speed. He stated that there was no apparent sound from the object itself.

NOTE: was born on 10 January 1931 at Rayton, Missouri. His hobbies are photography and first aid. It appears to be a sensible, intelligent person and did not appear to over exaggerate.
