6. In regard to comment by "r. [redacted]" relative to the sighting of the unidentified unconventional aircraft by another individual, the following news item appearing in the Kansas City Star, 6 January 1950, is submitted:

"DOUSE OVER CRASH CAUSE
Driver Tells Police a Flying Saucer Blinds Him"

"A flying saucer was reportedly seen in Kansas City, Kansas, early today, but police are skeptical about it.

[Redacted], 33 years old, [redacted], reported the phenomenon. He was driving east on Kansas Avenue, he told police, when "this flying saucer or a ball of fire or something like that" flashed across First Street in front of his car, northbound, blinding him. He lost control of his car and crashed into a truck parked at the curb, damaging both vehicles.

"He suffered cuts on his head and face and was treated at the police emergency hospital and arrested for reckless driving and driving while intoxicated. The truck was owned by Thomas L. NAGLE of Edwardsville, Ia."

January 12, 1950

I make this statement to LAWRENCE A. APPLEGATE, whom I know to be a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, United States Air Force.

On January 6, 1950 at 7:30 P.M., an employee of mine and myself left our place of work. As we walked toward our car we noticed a very bright object in the sky southwest of our position facing south. It first glance it seemed like a star but on second notice we were positive it was an airborne obstacle of some type either guided by man or of some other source. This object was a very brilliant white and flickered somewhat like a star. It was round in shape although no definite lines pertaining to shape were visible. It was no trouble a bright red flash at times in the center of the object and at other times on the outer edge.

As an example, using a mirror to reflect light, you would see a bright flash as it passes in front of your eyes. This red on the object was not constant but would be seen alternately through our full twenty-five minutes of sighting.

As to the shape or size of the object it would be hard to say definitely. The brilliant glow was round and nothing else could be seen because of the glare. The size would be dependent on height and distance. Estimating its distance at 50 miles and height 5000 to 4000 feet, it was six to eight inches in diameter. Speed could not be estimated. It seemed to hover for periods of about ten minutes at a time, gradually descending in altitude, then at the last, maintaining an altitude of about 3000 to 4000 feet continued west, southwest. At first sighting estimated altitude was 8000 to 10,000 feet.

After sighting the object from the parking lot in front of our plant we drove about ten or fifteen miles west and south to a high point. We kept it in sight up to this time and then watched it for about ten minutes. During this last ten minutes it seemed to hover. No motion was visible, only the color flickering, and the red flashes continuing. Then it started moving west, southwest. At this time we drove back over our same route and kept it in sight half the way back, then it disappeared. We continued to our original sighting point and noticed nothing comparable to this object. We continued past our original point of sighting to another high point and the object was not visible. The object also was not comparable to an airplane, dirigible or balloon of any type. As to the length of time of sighting it was approximately twenty-five to thirty minutes.

DETAILS:

1. Investigation was initiated by the District Commander, 13th OSI District, upon receipt of information that Mr. (Raytowm) Kansas City, Missouri, had sighted an unconventional aircraft on 6 January 1950.

AT KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI

2. On 9 January 1950 I/Sgt MACARTHUR of the Provost Marshal's Office, Fairfax AFB, Kansas, telephonically advised this office that a "Flying Saucer" had been sighted on 7 January 1950, at about 1930 hours, by a [redacted].

Investigation revealed that the [redacted], sighting the unconventional aircraft, resided at [redacted], Kansas City, Missouri, and was employed at the Bendix Aircraft Corporation, 95th and Troost Street, Kansas City, Missouri.

3. On 12 January 1950 Mr. [redacted] was interviewed at the Bendix Plant. Mr. [redacted] of Kansas City, Missouri, punched the time clock at the Bendix Plant at 1926 hours and left the building by the main entrance, located at the south side of the plant.

[Redacted] went on to say that as they emerged from the building and walked toward the parking lot across the street, they noticed a bright object in the sky to the southwest of their position. At first glance it appeared to be a star but closer observation convinced them that what they viewedwas an Airborne aircraft of some type.

[Redacted] being round in shape, although "no definite lines pertaining to shape were visible". He said that it was brilliant white and that a bright red flash was observed from the center of the object from time to time and at other times from the center edge of the object. This red flash was not constant but would be seen alternately throughout the twenty-five minutes that the object was in view. [Redacted] estimated that the object was, at one time, 30 miles away and 5,000 to 4,000 feet high and approximately 6 to 8 inches in diameter. Its speed could not be estimated and it appeared to hover in one position for a period of ten minutes. No motion was visible at this time but the color flickered and the red flashes continued. This was observed from a point 15 miles south and west of their original sighting point where the two men traveled to obtain a better view. From this point, according to [redacted] the beacon at the O'Lathe Naval AB could be seen and the object then appeared to be over but beyond the Air Base. The two returned to their original sighting point, keeping the object in view during half of the trip back. Upon reaching the original sighting point the object was not visible. They then proceeded to a high point southeast of the Bendix Plant but did not see the object again. [Redacted] declared that the

His hobbies are electroplating and flying.

4. concurred in statements and added that the object they had sighted appeared to swirl or rotate at a terrific speed. He stated that there had been no sidereal motion but that it had, except for the period of hovering, moved continuously away from them. He estimated that its altitude at first sighting was 9,000 to 10,000 feet, but went on to say that he thought when he had first sighted the object that it had been "greenish" in color but that he next decided it was a light orange-almost white color. He said that a "red ring" encircled the object and that in regular intervals it appeared to expand and diffuse the entire object with a reddish glow. According to the object appeared to be its terrific speed but he could give no estimate of this speed. He stated that there was no apparent sound from the object and that upon disappearing it seemed to fade from view. Its size appeared to be that of a softball and the object reminded him of the Planet Saturn. According to both observers the night was clear, there were no clouds in the sky, and the moon was rising at the time. Both men informed the writer that they had heard of a man who had been driving in the vicinity of Kansas City the same day and who had become involved in an accident while observing a "Flying Saucer." They thought this story had appeared in the Kansas City Star.

NOTE: was born on 10 January 1931 at Raytown, Missouri. His hobbies are photography and first aid. He appeared to be a sensible, intelligent person and did not appear to over exaggerate.
