SUMMARY: (Enter summary of report. Give significant details of incident in this paragraph. List locations in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part I(a).)

1. Investigation of pilot report indicates the possibility of an unidentified aircraft being sighted at approximately EJK1520 on 24/0512Z by an F-86D pilot while flying a routine Combat Air Patrol mission. The pilot claimed radar contact for approximately five seconds after the first sighting. His lock-on the aircraft was broken and he failed to re-establish radar contact during the remainder of the mission.

2. Three unsuccessful intercept attempts were made in the general area of EJK1520, ETA, and ETA. Visual contact was made intermittently for approximately forty minutes. During the second attempt at interception, momentary interception was noted on local radar scopes. Both in the F-86D and at the 684th ACW Squadron located at Davis-McMahan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona (EJK007L1). On the third intercept attempt, the F-86D pilot was forced to break off the chase due to low fuel status. No other known friendly aircraft were reported that the aircraft behaved in an un-orthodox manner while apparently maneuvering to avoid interception and finally disengaged in a southerly direction, on a course which would take it into Mexico or Central America.

3. The possibility exists that sighting was not of an Air Force airplane, and that in possibility was on an unauthorized flight over U.S. territory.

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

ORIGINATING AGENCY: 4708 24TH AIR DIVISION (DEFENSE)
REPORT NO: PAGE 2 OF 12 PAGES

1. KENNETH G. HITZ, 1st Lt. USAF, AO 22282232, 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, Davis-Monthan AFB, Torrs Base, Arizona, pilot of aircraft B-464, 3675, was interrogated at 30/2105. His account of incident with unidentified air-craft follows: (Numbers in parentheses denote column numbers in relation to the unidentified aircraft); see enclosure 1)

I was airborne at 24/0510Z on a local Combat Air Patrol mission.

a. Near climbing to an altitude of 15,000 feet at a location approximately 20 miles northwest of Nogales, Arizona under GCI control of 4208 ACW Squadron ("Sniper" located at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, AK0711).

b. At 24/0519Z I sighted an unidentified flying object approximately 10 to 20 nautical miles northwest of Nogales. Since I was 30 to 40 nautical miles northwest of Nogales, the unidentified object was sighted from an eleven o'clock position and appeared to be 5 to 10,000 feet above me, heading on a 180° vector (1).

c. Contact and July was accomplished when unidentified object was over Nogales and approximately ten miles ahead of me (2).

d. Radar lock was broken not more than five seconds after July and at the time afterward was I able to re-establish radar contact. At this time the unidentified object was moving away from me at 330° heading.

e. I chased the unidentified object until I reached EJL2035 at an altitude of 28,000 feet and an indicated speed of 350 knots (3).

f. I returned to Nogales and then turned on an easterly heading toward Douglas, Arizona, at an altitude of 20,000 feet and an indicated speed of 375 knots.

g. At this time I was visually monitoring the unidentified object. I paralleled my course at a distance of twenty nautical miles on my three o'clock position and maintained an altitude of approximately 5 to 10,000 feet above me (4). When I reached EJL2052, the unidentified object was on my two o'clock high position (5).

h. I turned south over Douglas (EJL2721) and again gave chase. The unidentified object was then on my twelve o'clock high position, also on a southerly heading, and moving away from me (6 and 7).

i. When it became apparent that I could not close in on the unidentified object, I returned to Douglas, Arizona (3).

j. During the chase described in paragraphs 1.j and 1.i above, I noticed a group of dots on my scope while I was in manual control. There is a possibility that these dots could have been an interference pattern or ground clutter return.

k. When I reached Douglas, I took a westerly heading towards Nogales. I maintained the unidentified object parallel my course at a distance of twenty nautical miles on my nine o'clock position and maintained an altitude of approximately 5 to 10,000 feet above me (9 and 10).

l. At Nogales I turned south and again chased the unidentified object (11). It was an area on my twelve o'clock high position south and moving away.

1a. When I reached the approximate plotted position of JOE9053, I was forced to break off the chase because of low fuel status (12).

1b. I then proceeded back to Davis-Monthan AFB without further incident. Arrival was accomplished at 24/0600Z.

1c. All that was ever distinguishable of the unidentified object was a hazy glow of red and green flashes with a stronger red flash occurring approximately every third interval.

1d. The unidentified object seemed to remain 5 to 10,000 feet above me throughout the incident. My altitude varied from 15,000 to 25,000 feet.

2. JOE F. SULLIVAN, 1st Lt, USAF, AO 2219672, 684th ACGW Squadron, controller on duty during time of incident with unidentified aircraft was interrogated at 20/2200Z. Has account of incident follows:

2a. At 24/0510Z, pilot of aircraft EN/15 (1st Lt Kenneth G. Hite) requested flight-following to Douglas via Nogales.

2b. At 24/0513Z, EN/15 reported an unidentified object on his eleven o'clock high position at a distance of 10 to 15 nautical miles.

2c. EN/15 asked me if I had the unidentified object under surveillance in my radar scope. My answer was negative.

2d. According to information received from the pilot, both EN/15 and the unidentified object were approximately an equal distance from the observer. EN/15 was picked up on my radar scope, but I was unable to gain the object.

2e. I then requested EN/15 to close in on the unidentified object and attempt to establish radar contact.

2f. At no time during the entire mission did Sniper Control have radar contact with the unidentified object.

2g. At one time during the incident I had one or two 10° strobes of interference on my radar scope. This interference terminated before I was able to determine its nature. But its appearance was similar to that observed on the scope during high voltage flashovers.

2h. EN/15 reported scope interference at the same time.

2i. I scrambled no more aircraft because at that time the incident did not seem to warrant further action.

2j. After EN/15 landed I checked with Davis-Monthan Base Operations for possible EN/15 traffic in the local area. I received a negative answer.

3. A report of local military air traffic during the period of the incident was requested from base operations, Davis-Monthan AFB. The following report was received via teletype at 20/2245Z:

3a. There were no outbound flights from 24/0001Z to 24/0702Z.

3b. There were two inbound flights during the period described in paragraph 3a above.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

8. An unconfirmed report indicates the sighting of an unidentified aircraft in the vicinity of EXKA, EXKB, EXLA, AND EXLB at 24/0512%.

a. The possibility exists that the pilot did observe and lock on an actual blip. According to his explanation, his inability to find the blip a second time was due to the apparent aircraft increasing its distance to a point outside the pilot's radar search range.

b. There is a possibility that momentary ground clutter return appeared as a blip to the pilot. The fact that the blip was approximately the same position on his scope as was his visual sighting led him to believe that the two were the same object.

c. Determination that the blip was actually the sighted aircraft should not be made on the pilot's failure to observe closing rate indications on his radar scope.

9. The duplicate interference encountered was probably coincidental.

a. The 8,000 megacycle frequency difference between the two radar processes precludes the possibility of simultaneous jamming. The possibility of harmonics is also precluded.

b. The basic description of the interference observed by the duty controller establishes the probability that it was high voltage arc-over.

c. No conclusion can be drawn from the pilot's description of interference due to his admitted inexperience with such conditions.

20. The pilot's description of the unidentified object leads to the conclusion that it was an aircraft with a speed greater than that of a B-25b. If such was the case, its behavior leads to the possibility that it was an unauthorized flight over U.S. territory.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
The primary intelligence interest in this report, and any other reports of similar nature, lies in the obvious weakness of present detection and interception capabilities along the southwestern J. S. international border. The possibility, however remote, of forest or snooper flights of potentially hostile aircraft from areas south of the border should not be discounted completely.
