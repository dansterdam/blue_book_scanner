Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

The past two months most scientific people are seeing of reporting. a least 12 or 15. 
On 1-86 so strange event happened about 7:40 pm and was seen by several others including myself. 
The bright light traveled from the northeast to the southwest direction. it moved at a terrific speed and would disappear and reappear. When it would reappear it would be in a different position.
It made no noise and seemed to be completely under control. There were no other lights visible. It passed directly over us and we could not determine its shape or size from that distance.
After passage it disappeared going back towards the northeast. I am unable to account for this phenomena. It surely could not be an aircraft or anything else I have ever seen. 
It was so fast and maneuverable that it could not possibly have been a meteor or any known aircraft.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT 
NEAR NOGALES, ARIZONA, SEPTEMBER 29, 1954
CASE NO. 25
24 DECEMBER 1954, Zebra
Russell F. Newman, 2ND LT., USAF  
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING, NOGALES, ARIZONA, 29 SEPTEMBER 1954.
SUMMARY: (Under separate cover)
DETAILS: On 29 September 1954, at approximately 1900 hours, an unidentified object was sighted flying over the area of Nogales, Arizona. The pilot of a Cessna 170 aircraft, call sign 32Q, reported visual contact with the object. The pilot stated that he saw a silvery object, approximately 40 feet in diameter, which was flying at an altitude of about 15,000 feet. The object was seen to make a sudden right-angle turn and then depart the area at a high rate of speed. The pilot reported that all attempts to intercept the object were unsuccessful. Visual contact was made intermittently for approximately 10 minutes. The object was lost from sight when it disappeared into the clouds.
EVALUATION: The possibility exists that sighting was not of an Air Force airplane, and that is possibly was an unidentified object. However, the intermittent visual contact, high altitude, and abrupt maneuvers are characteristic of certain Air Force aircraft under certain conditions. The inability to make positive identification and the lack of conclusive evidence make it impossible to arrive at a definite conclusion as to the identity of the object sighted.

CONTRACTOR: KENNETH C. BRITT, LT., USAF, 69 222-9521 FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON, DAVIS-MONTHAN AIR FORCE BASE, ARIZONA.
SIGHTING: BETWEEN 1600 AND 1630 HOURS, 6 DECEMBER 1954, WHILE ON ROUTINE PATROL DUTY IN F-86D AIRCRAFT. VISUAL AND RADAR CONTACT WITH 5 UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 25 MINUTES. OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED BY ONE OTHER PILOT IN FLIGHT, CAPTAIN WILCOX, AND RADAR CONTACT WAS CONFIRMED BY CONTROL TOWER.
OBJECT: CLIMBING AT A RATE OF 2,000-3,000 FEET PER MINUTE. SPEEDS ESTIMATED TO BE 1,000-1,200 KNOTS, VERY FAST AND EXTREMELY MANEUVERABLE. OBJECTS PULSED WITH RED AND BLUE LIGHT AND WERE FIRST OBSERVED AT AN ALTITUDE OF 30,000 FEET. OBJECTS THEN DESCENDED RAPIDLY TO APPROXIMATELY 10,000 FEET. CONTACT WAS LOST WHEN OBJECTS LEFT VISUAL RANGE AND DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR.
TO 25 20 JANUARY 1955, SIGHTING HAS NOT BEEN POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED. ANALYSIS IS CONTINUING AND UNTIL THIS SIGHTING IS POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED, IT IS CONSIDERED UNIDENTIFIED.

AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS OBSERVED BY KENNETH C. BRITT, LT., USAF, AND CAPTAIN WILCOX ON 6 DECEMBER 1954 CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY CONVENTIONAL FLYING OBJECTS, AIRCRAFT, OR NATURAL PHENOMENA. THE SIGHTING IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED UNIDENTIFIED.

UNCLASSIFIED

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

REPORTING AGENCY: 362ND AIR DIVISION (DEFENSE)

REFERENCE: AFMDC 1 report dated December 3, 1954, concerning a reported break-off of the chase because of low fuel status (K)-PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO LANDING RATHER THAN CONTINUING PURSUIT OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT. DEPARTURE OF OBJECT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AT 24/0600Z.

ALL THAT WAS EVER LEARNED ABOUT THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS THAT IT WAS OVAL IN SHAPE AND GREEN FLASHES WITH A STRONGER RED FLASH ACCORDING TO PILOT OBSERVATION.

THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT SEEMED TO REMAIN 3.50 TO 4.0 NAUTICAL MILES ABOVE WHILE BEING PURSUED THROUGHOUT THE INCIDENT.

LT COL P. SULLIVAN, AF S/N 12367, PILOT ATC CO 32AARRW, CALLED THE OBJECT UNTIL HIS GASOLINE WAS NEARLY EXHAUSTED AND HE WAS FORCED TO BREAK OFF PURSUIT.

AS REQUESTED, F-86 AIRCRAFT S/N 51-2905 (PILOTED BY KENNETH G. HITE) WAS SCRAMBLED TO INTERCEPT THE OBJECT, BUT WAS UNABLE TO VISUALLY REACQUIRE IT.

SLACK BETWEEN OBSERVATION AND DISCLOSURE ON 12 DECEMBER WAS DUE TO CONFIRMATION OF INCIDENT THROUGH LENGTHY INVESTIGATION.

ACCORDING TO INFORMATION RECEIVED, BOTH F-86 AND OBJECT WERE VISIBLE FROM THE GROUND, CONFIRMING THE OBSERVATION FROM THE AIR.

F-86 WAS PICKED UP ON RADAR SCOPE, BUT IT WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT.

WHEN REQUESTED, F-86 WAS UNABLE TO CLOSE IN ON THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT AND RADAR CONTACT WAS LOST.

AT ONE TIME DURING THE INCIDENT, I HAD ONE OR TWO 105 STRIKES OR JAMS ON MY INSTRUMENTS, INDICATING SOME FORM OF ELECTRONIC INTERFERENCE WITH THE AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.

ON 12/13, NO OTHER IDENTICAL INTELLIGENCE WAS RECEIVED BECAUSE AT THAT TIME THE INCIDENT DID NOT SEEM TO WARRANT FURTHER ACTION.

FOR POSSIBLE UAVY TRAFFIC IN THE LOCAL AREA, I RECEIVED A NEGATIVE ANSWER.

INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED VIA TELEPHONE AT 30/2232Z.

THERE WERE NO OUTBOUND FLIGHTS FROM 24/0000Z TO 24/0700Z.

a. U. S. Weather Bureau Reports on winds and velocities as follows:
Surface winds 320 degrees at 10 knots
Winds at 3,000 feet 320 degrees at 15 knots
Winds at 6,000 feet 320 degrees at 18 knots
Winds at 9,000 feet 320 degrees at 22 knots

b. Ceilings: None.
c. Visibility: 10 miles.
d. Cloud cover: None.
e. Thunderstorms in area and quadrant in which located: None.

3. An unconfirmed report indicates the sighting of an unidentified aircraft. The possibility exists that the pilot did observe and look on an unidentified object and that his description is necessarily as accurate as possible, as it may have increased its distance to a considerable degree over a second time but was due to its apparent abrupt acceleration.

4. There is a possibility that momentary ground clutter returns similar to the pilot's description. These are often caused by atmospheric conditions or an unexplained anomaly in the radar. The pilot's description has the two were the same object.

5. The determination that the blip was actually the sighted aircraft could not be made due to the pilot's failure to observe closing rate indicators as his aircraft increased its distance at a considerable rate of acceleration.

6. The duplicate interferences encountered was probably coincidental.
a. An AF-W-APL memo summarizes the interfereces between the two targets as:
     (1) The possibility of simultaneous jamming.
     (2) The possibility of controlled as to the high voltages and low wattages involved.
b. No conclusion can be drawn from the pilot's description of the interference with such conditions as existed.
