DEAR SIR:

One week ago I sighted an unidentified flying object. My attention was called to this object by my daughter, aged 10.

I have been a life-long student of aviation, took my first flying lesson at the age of 15. Spent three years in the USAAF. I've been a member of the National Aeronautical Association for some 15 years.

I have been a "flying saucer" fan for a long time but up to now had never seen anything. I would class as a saucer. My but this object seemed near and I could see it plainly.

The object made no sound at all. It seemed to be pulsing; the smoke and haze in front of it seemed to be distortion. It seemed to be almost motionless.

Mr. daughter, aged 10, first spotted the object. She was in the garden and attracted my attention to something in the sky. I was in the kitchen.

I took a look at the object and knew they could not make a sharp right-angle turn as such.

The object made no sound at all. It seemed to be pulsing; the smoke and haze in front of it seemed to be distortion. It seemed to be almost motionless.

I also know they could not make a sharp right-angle turn as such.

Transcription of the text:

"noon i look about four miles away. I told my daughter to watch for it as a point where I thought it would pass out into the clear sky. We saw nothing unusual then or at any other time during the day or night, so far as I can recall.
When questioned further, they did not claim to have any other sightings to report. They merely observed the object as described above. They made no special effort to keep it under close observation, as they did not regard it as an unusual occurrence and felt no special concern about it. They seem to have given it only casual notice, much as one would a passing aircraft, without making any special effort to study or identify it.
Based on my theory of unmanned craft-unless becoming an occupant of the object were possible, which seems highly improbable-there would be no point to close observation. Such craft would not likely respond to efforts at identification or communication and would be essentially unimportant except as data for analysis. Unless something more dramatic occurred, simple observation would be the only practical response.
I conclude that on this very hot day a quiet spot on the horizon appeared to be the destination of an object which proved to be on this occasion a natural phenomenon, since there was no other sighting, either at the time or later, to substantiate the original impression. I could find no evidence to believe that what was seen was anything more than a natural occurrence, normal in every respect.
Thank you."

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. The diagram appears to depict a landscape with a river (labeled "Dan River") and various objects or structures along the river, including what seems to be a building or facility labeled "Plant No. 1 DANR" and an unidentified object in the sky.
