AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

831st Air Division, USAF                REPORT NO. 1            PAGE 1 OF 3 PAGES

a. Object data:
(1) Elongated egg. (See Attachment # 1)

(2) The size of the object could not be accurately judged, however, the observer stated the object was slightly large, top to bottom, than his handspread (about 7½") at his arms length (27"), when the object was at a distance of about 50 feet. At the side view, the object was about twice as long as its height and in the general shape of an elongated egg.

(3) The color was dull red with purple waves coursing throughout the extremities of the object. Although the color when dull, the intensity of light seemed moderate to bright to the observer. He did not notice the color reflected on objects below.

(4) One (1), as far as the observer could determine.

(5) N/A

(6) None

(7) None

(8) The object emitted a sound which he described as the hum of a large transformer but higher in pitch. This object also agitated the air and he described the sound as similar to but vastly greater in volume than a whip swishing through the air.

(9) [Redacted] stated that while the object was in the vicinity of his home, his radio which had recently been receiving very clear programs until then, was completely blocked by intense static.

b. Description of Course of Object:
(1) The attention of [Redacted] was drawn to the object while he was in his darkened bedroom by a bright, steady light which was reflected against his between wall opposite the windows of the room. He realized that the light was the intense to be the headlights of a car. As his parents were away at night school and he was in charge of the home and his younger brother, he arose, dressed and went out on the front porch of the home to see what caused the light. The family pet dogs had commenced to howl and run around as if in terror and he wanted to let them in the house.

(2) The object was first observed in a due westerly direction from the home, at an elevation of about 20°, at an undetermined distance from the observers position.

(3) [Redacted] observed the object on its first pass for about 10 seconds. It flew directly towards his home on a steady declining altitude of approach and when over his front yard at an altitude of about 8 to 10 feet, it veered gradually away to the North Yard. He was, however, unable to see the object when he knew that he should have been looking at the rear of the object. He could hear the object only while he could see its. He went back into the house to calm the family pets and his younger brother, and noticed the time at about one minute after 2100 hours LST (0501 Z). He went back outside at five minutes after 2100 hours LST (0505 Z), and observed the object again in the West or the house and approaching to closer to the house on this second pass and immediately went inside to get a gun. He became terrified as the object sped past the house and decided against the gun. He started that on this pass his younger brother saw the object through the living room front window which was covered by split bamboo blinds. [Redacted] went outside again at 05-12½ observed the object to the West of his position, approaching at high speed.

He went back into the house and the object again sped by the house. The object passed directly over the house twice more. The last time at 2115 IST (0515 2).

k. Captain Rudolph E. Pestalozzi, USAF, A0739577 831st Air Division Intelligence
Officer. Seems to be an average young man of average intelligence. He
is liked by his schoolmates and teachers. His parents say on him, say he is a reason-
ably responsible boy. He is a flown with the Air Scouts and as a hobby makes and
flies serial rockets. His parents verified his story of the family pets reactions
to this incident. When they arrived home at approximately 0600 2, the animals were
whimpering and shaking and hiding under the furniture. The static on the radiowas
not evident before 0500 3 nor after 0515 3. Indicating some electrical or magnetic
disturbance in the area during these observations. Estimated that on each pass of
the object he heard a very sharp cracking noise and compared it to the spark gap of
an automobile spark plug but of greater volume and intensity. He was emphatic in say-
ing that this noise was not of a sonic boom which he has heard many times.

Two neighbors living in the area who were questioned at different times, admitted
seeing "something" at about that time, experiencing radio and television
interference. They would not, however, give any details nor did they give the report-
ing officer permission to use their names.

Unidentified Flying Objects have been reported to the 831st Air Division Intel-
ligence Officer during the past two weeks by both civilian and military observers,
who decline to be used for reporting purposes for fear of "being laughed at".
