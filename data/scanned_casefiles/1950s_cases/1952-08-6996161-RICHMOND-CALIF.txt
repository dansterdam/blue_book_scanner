Dear Sir:

The object I reported, to be frank, excited me and also the other observers who saw it. However we have been seeing this same object every evening for over two weeks! These are about 15 observers who have seen it besides myself since slow. It always appears in the western sky about five minutes after the sun sets and we have watched it for as much as twenty minutes, sometimes less. We have noticed it then appears much more to the south lately, just at the same altitude and it always goes down behind the hills. It appears blue-white at higher altitude and then changes to orange and as it gets near the horizon seems to become much larger.

After watching it for this length of time I feel it is most likely a star. Watching it through binoculars is seems perfectly round, but

a times seems to flatten out. just few a
record this object does appear about 15 minutes
before the first star!

I am an amateur photographer and a
few nights after I first spoke to I think my
comments up on the facts and attempt to get
a time exposure of it. However I must admit
that nothing seems to show up on the negative.
at my sole film enclosing two of them limits
this letter. Maybe your photographer through
enlargement may find it will appear.

In closing may I add that I was
now observer during the last week with 500
hours to my credit; also I helped get rest past
here going in 1950 and am now serving two
and three shifts a week; but in all this time
of observing I have never seen anything like
this before, except that one evening in 1950.
so I have said before, it may be, and possibly
is, a star or planet but it is the first thing
like sure view one so bright and clear and
large.

I do know it is not my imagination
because so many other observers have been it
since I first saw it. We all have agreed
on what we have seen also.

I sincerely hope this will help to
clear up at least one of the hundreds of
reports you must receive.

Sincerely,
Ronald F. Brown
