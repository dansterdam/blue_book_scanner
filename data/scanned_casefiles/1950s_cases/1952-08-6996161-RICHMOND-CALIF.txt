30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. 
Use additional sheets of the same size paper if necessary.

Dear Sir:
The object appeared to be frank, circular and with other characteristics which seem to have been seen by others. The speed is very slow as only about 15 percent of watchers have seen it. It appears as if less than rather slay above the place and seemed to be moving cautiously. See the haste motion of the watch, it disappeared much more to the south quickly. It seems little more to the south rather than to the hill. It will move to approach and now as if to become smaller but not smaller but no more appeared watch.
Please note the speed attitude and that such a change and not give mean the hanggulseem to become more.
I feel quite lonely at night. Walking is thorough hours in some perfectly sound, but standing in sight through binoculars is seems period rather than to the hill.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document that appears to be a letter or report from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Crimes appear to flatten out spread about 15 minutes later. There are no available photographs and a few sightings for the report to date. If any more significant data can be obtained, I will be glad to submit additional details.

In closing may I add that I believe daily the number of sightings we report to reach 500 during 1950 and more sightings are coming in daily. However, at this time I believe we should discontinue sending reports that offer little or no information that would assist in determining the nature of the objects sighted.

I sincerely hope this will help to clear up at least one of the hundreds of reports you must receive.

Sincerely,
Ronald T. Brown"
