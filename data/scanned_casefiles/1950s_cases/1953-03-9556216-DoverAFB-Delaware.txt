U.S.A.F-ATIC
(Unclassified)* Unidentified Flying Object over Delaware.
INFORMATION:
9 March 1953	1 March 1953
A. C. READ, Major, USAF
IR-305-53, dtd 21 Nov 52, IR-171-53. 27 Feb 53

The following information was received from the 502nd Air Base Squadron, ATIC-MATS, Dover AFB, Delaware. The date of the information is 1 March 1953. A copy of the attached report was furnished.
1. Approximately 2255 to 0600 hours 9 March 1953, six (6) Air Force personnel, including the Sergeant Controller of the GCA station, observed an unidentified object moving erratically in the sky over Dover AFB, Delaware.
2. According to one observer, an F/V pilot who is considered very reliable and who furnished continuous information during the sighting, the object appeared first as a "very bright light" which changed to "a reddish color" and then to a "yellowish color". It was observed to make "fast and erratic" maneuvers and at times appeared to "accelerate and decelerate" very rapidly. No sound was heard.
3. The object was tracked on radar by the GCA station personnel and its speeds were estimated by them to vary from 12,000 to 15,000 mph. The object was observed to make several extremely sharp turns and at times appeared to hover. The horizontal distance covered was estimated to be 50 miles, the altitude varying from 20,000 to 50,000 feet.
4. The weather at the time of sighting was 12,000 feet overcast, visibility 3 to 5 miles, wind from 270° at 15 knots, 16,000 feet from 280° at 90 to 100 knots, 20,500 feet from 270°.
5. A prevalent explanation of object at New Castle County Airport, Delaware, is that observers are sighting "flares dropped" from unidentified navigato r who plotted object.

AIRBASE AND AIR COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE
INTELLIGENCE REPORT 1013-3 ACC 6 MARCH 1953
DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, DELAWARE

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object over Dover, Delaware

TO: Detachment Commander
Det 1013-3 ACC
Dover AFB, Del.

1. As approximately 1920 EST the Dover AFB Control Tower received a radio call from a pilot that he had observed a silvery, disc-shaped object over the city of Dover, Delaware. This call was received by the tower operator, pfc Richard Roth. The object was observed by other tower personnel and was described as a silvery, disc-shaped object, approximately 30 feet in diameter. The object was observed to be hovering over the city of Dover for several minutes, then suddenly climb and disappear from view. Pfc Roth attempted to establish radio contact with the object but was unsuccessful. He stated that he could not get the object with the naked eye.

2. At 2130 EST a similar object was spotted by the tower, first as a target on the scope and then visually. I called the Mew Castle Filter Center and requested that an officer check the object. A Lt. (?) officer confirmed that an officer checked the object, but was unable to identify it. The object was lost on scope and could not be regained. No attempt was made to intercept the object with aircraft. The object seemed to remain stationary, then faded out the same as it had appeared. The object was approximately the size of a dime held at arm's length, but seemed to remain in the same place, lacking any definite speed or direction of movement. After the object faded from view, it could not be reacquired on the scope. The tower personnel felt that this was the same or a similar object as had been seen earlier in the evening.

No more objects were spotted or reported the remainder of the night.

(f) Weather sequence: Unknown. Observers estimate of weather condition: Clear and 20 miles vis.
(g) Any Metro activity: none known.
(h) Existence of any physical evidence: None
(i) Interrogation or identification of captain: Lt. Rogers, A/T pilot, who at the time of sighting was sitting on 5 minute standby Air Defense Alert, requested permission to take off to intercept the object. He contacted the air division about the request, but was refused. After a pilot's request for permission was denied and the craft of the observers watched the light until it finally disappeared.
