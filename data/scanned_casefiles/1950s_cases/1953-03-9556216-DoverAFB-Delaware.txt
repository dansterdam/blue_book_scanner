IR-805-52, dtd 21 Nov 52, IR-171-53, 27 Feb 53

1. The following information was received from the 36th Air Base Squadron, MATS, Dover AFB, Delaware. On 1 Mar 53, a copy of this report was forwarded to HQ, 26th Air Div., Roslyn, N.Y.

2. Approximately 2115 to 2145 hours 1 March 1953, six (6) Air Force personnel, five of them were radar, observed an object from the Dover AFB Control Tower at a position 12 ACP, five degrees elevation.

3. According to one observer, an AW pilot who is considered very astute and one of the alertest, the object was placed at five to ten miles distant, and they "questioned" is being fifty feet across. Object shape appeared spherical with the top half color of a full moon and the bottom half constantly changing color from yellow to dark red to a deep orange. No sound, speed, maneuvers or exhaust and the observation ended when light appeared to fade out. Sight made with and without 10 power glasses.

4. Request to scramble was relayed to 777th ACGW Squadron, Salerno, N.J., but Controller denied pilot permission upon advice of 26th Air Division, Roslyn, New York. No air traffic in general area.

5. Existing weather at time of sight was 12,000 feet scattered clouds, 25,000 feet thin overcast, visibility 10 miles, temperature 28°, dew point 23°, surface winds Northeast at 8 knots, altimeter reading 3030. Winds aloft at 12,000 feet from 290° at 50 knots, 16,000 feet from 280° at 90 to 100 knots, 20,000 feet from 270° at 60 knots.

6. Prevalent explanation of object at New Castle County Airport, Delaware, is that observers are sighting planet Jupiter. This explanation purportedly emanated from unidentified navigator who plotted object.

Dover AFB, Del

1. At approximately 1920 CST the Dover AFC Control Tower received a call from the high F16 operations, 1st adj object was an unidentified flying object over the city of Dover Delaware. This call was received from an officer of the base and was forwarded through the both F16 to the Control Tower. The base radar and ground to ground contact, this was done, within fifteen (15) minutes. Five (5) officers came to the tower. Their names are as follows: Lt Rogers, Lt England, Lt Miller, Lt Knight and Lt Shannon. In one could not the object with the naked eye or binoculars.

2. At 2130 the unusual object was spotted by the tower, first person to see object was Lt Zimmer, Flight Data man in the tower. Immediately I called the both F16 and requested that an officer check the object. Two (2) officers, Lt Rogers and Lt Shannon, arrived at the tower and verified the report. The closest description I could give would be, I would circular and would be very bright orange frame and fade out time approximately within fifteen (15) minutes. The object just faded out, but seemed to remain in the same place, looked to be over the city of Dover Delaware, west of Dover AFB. Just before the object faded out the officers were leaving to go after the object, then the object disappeared and the officers, before leaving, told us to scramble the aircraft if anything appears again, and they would let the Radar station know immediately, in case it appeared again. The weather report at this time was one fire zero zero zero (15,000) overcast with about six (6) miles visibility. I called M/Sgt Mains and informed him of the object. The Officer of the Day, Lt William of the 1757th Ferrying Sq. also called the tower to inquire about the object.

3. No more objects were spotted or reported the remainder of our shift, 1700 to 2400.
