10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    One (1) round, red object, the size of a nickel (thru binoculars???), was seen to travel west at a slow speed.

11. COMMENTS
    Since this object crossed a major portion of the sky, in a straight course, in a period of seven to eight minutes, it is highly suggestive of a aircraft. A check with the local airline offices in Colorado Springs indicates that a NORTHWESTERN flight left Minneapolis for Fargo, N.D. at 2050CST on 23 Jul 55, twenty minutes before the sighting occurred. So Cloud is on the flight path from Minneapolis to Fargo and is approx. 50 miles from Minneapolis. PROBABLY AIRCRAFT.
