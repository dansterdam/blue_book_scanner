Sir,

I have the honour to forward the following report of an unidentified aircraft:

1. On 20th August a pair of aircreat were observed from Borahas St. Faith at approximately 22000 feet at 12.00 hours. They appeared to be plotting aircraft at approximately 30000 feet at a great distance and above making two distinct trails on heading of 250 degrees.

2. A detailed investigation has been carried out but these aircraft have not been positively identified. It was considered possibly these having been U.S.A.A.F. aircraft from Bentwaters No.21. Group, 2nd Air Division U.S.A.A.F. Central Fighter Establishment, R.A.F. Duxford, R.A.F. Honington, Cranfield, Wattisham and Bassingbourn.

3. No further investigation is being carried out, as all authorities who might have had aircraft in this area have already been contacted.

I have the honor to be
Sir,
Your Obedient Servant

I have the honour to refer to your letter on the above subject dated 22nd August 1950 rer. 50/5/27/Int. and to state that the following information on the following points:

a. For what length of time had the aircraft's track been observed prior to the scrambling of the meteors at 1400 and from what direction had it appeared?

b. What was the speed prior to the scrambling and were there any subsequent alterations? What was the ground speed and direction at 40,000 feet?

c. What was the hostile's outgoing track and for how long was it observed?

d. Has any check been made with the Dutch C. & E. R. organisation for that date or Allied squadrons operating in that area?

e. This report is considered most interesting as if it can be positively established that an aircraft was flying at the time, area and height, then consideration must be given to the possibility of an aircraft like the Type 27 I.s.f.R. role.

The image does not contain any photographs. The text appears to be a description of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred near Bogalusa, Louisiana on August 19, 1950 as part of Project Blue Book. The text describes the appearance of the object, its movements, and the witness's observations. There is no human face or person identified in the text.

Text extracted from the document:

"FLYING SAUCER", AND NEAR IT'S MOTOR-
A witness, who lives about 6 miles east of Bogalusa, Louisiana, while driving down what might be described as a "country road" and reaching up to her right, to the seat, were many tall, stately, ping trees, saw an object, about 40 to 50 feet long, and shaped like a "flying saucer", about 400 to 500 feet in the air. 
At 5:40 p.m. on August 19, 1950 (the Saturday), while enrolling down what might be described as a "country road" and reaching up to her right, to the seat, were many tall, stately, ping trees, she noticed the object directly overhead and exclaimed: "Oh, look there goes one". 
"Flying saucer" as it did not hover the object an quickly as the did, but it was more concerned with what I heard than with what I saw. The thing did not have a motor, and there was no sound at all, and this fact, coupled with the swiftness of its movements, makes me think that, unlike the conventional type "propjet" gasoline motor, they did not have any sound or "roar" at all because there were no explosion occurring of any kind. When it first appeared, it was flying rather low, about 400 to 500 feet, but it was only a matter of seconds if disappeared altogether. In view of the noise the thing made, it would appear that we should have heard it before it got directly overhead. It suddenly decided that this was a time to back home, and because of the many tall trees down our right, we were talking, and became of the many tall trees on our right.
Regarding my allowance for height, etc. the "saucer" appeared to be rounded, and not square, at each end. The center was a round object, about the size of a 55 gallon drum of oil, and shaped or of the color of old gold.
in view of the noise the thing made, it would appear that we should have heard it before it got directly overhead. It suddenly decided that this was a time to back home, and because of the many tall trees down our right, we were talking, and became of the many tall trees on our right. 
Flying up or out of sight so rapidly, it was not an common sight to see those things, apparently flying them. I tried, after it was gone, to look at the sky where it disappeared, but we could find no further verification of this fact, and my sister-in-law confirmed that this was the first one they had seen.

I babily would have dismissed the whole affair shortly after returning to the house, following our Stroll up the road, (which I was of the opinion to call "The Young People's Magazine.") In this issue was a story which seemed most curious. It told of a family to whom a strange occurrence happened a few days after, what they said, was a "great sight in the sky" seen by the family. The story mentioned that on the evening of August 12, 1946, there was witnessed by the family a strange object in the sky. "It seemed round and lit up" and, as the story goes, the object was also seen by others. Later, a Mr. Delph, a man who lived near the family, came to their home to inquire as to what they had seen. He showed great interest, it is stated. 

The story was illustrated with several pictures, the captions of which were to the effect that the pictures showed the "actual sightings" of the strange object that had been seen. However, the descriptive matter did not indicate just what the pictures portrayed, and to me they seemed more like imaginings of what the "object" may have looked like, rather than actual photographs of the thing itself. I was not imagining anything of that nature. We were certainly not imagined; we were looking into the matter scientifically, and our interest, as is our nature, was simply to try to determine, if possible, what natural phenomena were witnessed.

Several pictures, the story goes, were taken of actual sightings that had been seen. In various parts of the country, we were told, there were "flying saucers" seen in the skies of Arlington, Virginia, and when the picture was taken at Richardson Heights, Dallas, Texas, here was one, too. However, the descriptive matter did not indicate the size or location of the object. But the thing was, the description stated that five men at the Chase National Bank, building in New York City, said they saw an object resembling one that they called a "flying saucer" pass over their building at 10:30 a.m., July 24, 1946. They said they saw it pass over their building that morning, without making any noise, and it disappeared in the northeast direction.

The story indicated that five men (persons) were involved in the incident, including a Mr. Rowe, who gave off no smoke or flame, and said "Here comes Superman.", when they saw the strange object. It was also stated that they were of the opinion, or thought, that the object was "a flying saucer" which, according to the story, "may they (saucers) were opinions, thought to be a development of some secret aerial device!" The article stated that he (Rowe?) advised, "and the saucers will disappear."

It was stated that (1) we did see the "flying saucer" as described, and (2) we do not intend to say clearly (and do that by request which is being compiled with:) "If you should happen to see a 'Saucer' and you are intelligible, Da. Trion, Dayton, Ohio, and tell them all about it."
