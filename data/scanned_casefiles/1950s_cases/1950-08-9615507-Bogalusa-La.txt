Sir,

I have the honour to forward the following report of an unidentified aircraft.

2. On 14th August a pair of Meteors were scrambled from Horsham St. Faith by Neatishead on plotting aircraft at approximately 40000 feet at 1400 hours. Meteor pilots when at about 25-30000 feet sighted aircraft at great distance and above making two distinct trails on heading of 220 degrees off Cromer. Meteors changed vectors and aircraft did pass through North to East. When Meteors reached 38800 feet aircraft trails vanished. Meteors were too far away at all times to given any description of aircraft or to judge height but appeared to pilot as suggested to pilot vividly placed engines. Following authorities have been contacted and deny having aircraft in vicinity:- Headquarters Bomber Command, Headquarters No2l Group, Headquarters No2l Group, 3rd Air Division, U.S.A.F., Central Fighter Establishment, R.A.F. Driffield, R.A.F. Boscombe Down, R.A.F. Farnborough, Cranfield, Marton and Hatfield.

3. A detailed investigation has been carried out but these aircraft have not been identified. It was considered originally these aircraft might be U.S.A.F. F.84's from Harnston who were in the area at the time, but the pilots of the U.S.A.F. aircraft state they saw the two Meteors at 36700 feet, but at the same time and above saw two further contrails.

4. No further investigation is being carried out, as all authorities who might have had aircraft in this area have already been contacted.

I have the honour to be
Sir,
Your obedient Servant

UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT

I have the honour to refer to your letter on the above subject dated 22nd August 1950 ref. FC/S.4297/Int. and to state that we would like further information on the following points:

a. For what length of time had the aircraft's track been observed prior to the scrambling of the aircraft at L400 and from what direction had it at appeared.

b. What was the speed prior to the scrambling and was there any subsequent alteration. What was the wind speed and direction at 40,000 feet.

c. What was the hostile's outgoing track and for how long was it observed.

d. Has any check been made with the Dutch G. & R. organisation for that date or Allied squadrons operating jets.

2. This report is considered most interesting as if it can be positively established that no home based aircraft was flying at the time, area and height, then consideration must be given to the possible use of an aircraft like the Type 27 in a P.R. role.

I have the honour to be,

SPECIAL Observation Incident 1/2329A

As August 14th Ref your A359 August 14th At 1322 hours O.G. plot appeared 055 degree true Northhead 90 miles area. Height give 15000 feet idept allotted 85%. 257 Squadron Red Section leader F1/Lt. ordered to scramble 1324 Red Section Airborne 1327. At 1328 hours raid picked up by Type 13 which gave height of 4000 feet. Amended height passed to Red Section which had levelled out at 15000 ft. At 1335 hours Red Section in position 10 miles N of Cromer still clinging visual trails on starboard beam and 1/4 above Red Section steering a parallel course.

To obtain height, Red Section get slightly ahead of trails in sight, at O.G.I. range 5 miles. At 1324½ hours Red Section saw trails turn to starboard, this confirmed by O.G.I. controller. Red Section also turned starboard. From 1341 hours unidentified aircraft and Red Section were plotted jointly in a position 7 miles due north - Hunstanton, and continued as joint plot on N.E.Westerly and finally northerly course.

At 1345 hours joint plot was then in a position 5 miles South of Malthorpe. Plot faded again and reappeared at 1349 hours 10-15 miles east of Grimsby. This was assumed to be a combined plot until such time as Red Section were ordered to turn starboard and south, when no apparent reason was seen. Controller of opinion that last plot of unidentified aircraft was at 1345 hours. At approximately 1345 hours Red Section were at 38000 feet with trails still above and at 7 o'clock. Pilot estimated range to be 10 miles - trails turning behind section. Trailing then ceased. Section continued climb up to 39500 feet and turned 360°.

No aircraft were seen. Trails when last seen were course starboard. No Section did not feel at any height up to 30500 feet F1/Lts. _____ is an experienced leader and controlling throughout was by O.G. Neithhead. Constant watch was kept but no track was seen to go seawards which could in any way be connected with the original plot.

WE SAW "FLYING SAUCER" AND NEAR IT'S MOTOR.

...We were vacationing at the home of my wife's sister, 1756 _____ near Bogalusa, Louisiana.
At 6:40P. M. August 12, 1950 (a Saturday), while strolling down what might be described as a "country lane". We saw and heard - a "flying saucer". "We were walking due north.

On our right, to the east, were many tall, stately, pine trees. On our left, to the west, were more pine trees, but not so many, and not so tall.

My sister-in-law saw the object first. She looked directly overhead and exclaimed, "Oh, look. There goes a flying saucer." I did not spot the object as quickly as she did, but I was more concerned with what I heard than with what I saw. I finally saw the thing definitely and a motor.

The normal like sound of a light peal of thunder - in fact, that's what I thought it was, just before my sister-in-law spoke. The sound of the motor was not at all like the conventional type "putt-putt" gasoline motor, nor did I have the "swoosh" sound of the jet-plane. I was further puzzled about the sound of thunder, because there were no clouds.

I looked at my watch. Immediately, and it was 6:40P. M. The object was moving due west, to our left. The object was flying rather low - about 1,800 to 2,500 feet high, but was traveling fast, at about 500 miles per hour. Within a matter of seconds it disappeared altogether. My wife was of the opinion that it was slightly falling, but we finally agreed that it was probably only following the curvature of the earth.

Disregarding any allowance for height, etc., the "saucer" appeared to be about 14 inches long, and about 8 inches wide. The difficult thing to realize was that it stood in the sky at a 45 degree angle, the top to the north, and the bottom to the south, but was traveling west. The object appeared to be rounded, and not square, at each end. The outer edges were of a pronounced aluminum color. Might in the center was a round object, about the size and shape of a good sized orange, of a fiery red color, or the color of old gold.

In view of the noise the thing made, it would appear that we should have heard it before it got directly overhead. We finally decided that this was because we were directly talking, and because of the many tall trees on our right.

Soon after we returned to the house, a native insisted that: "It's not an uncommon sight to see those things, apparently flying up out of the swamp around here, and disappearing off toward nearby Mississippi. However, we could find no further verification of this statement, and my sister-in-law confirmed that this was the first one they had seen.

I p bably would have dismissed the whole affair at another experience", except for the fact that, shortly after returning to the house - following our stroll - I was handed the August, 1950, copy of "LOOK" adorned as "The Young People's Magazine." In this issue was a story by the title of "The Great Flying Saucer Mystery." The title of the heading was "Are they War Space Ships 'From Other Planets'?" I was not sure about the first and third last sub-headings, but I was dead sure about the second one - we were not "crackpots", and we certainly had not been imagining anything of that nature. We were leisurely strolling, and admiring the beauties of nature. Besides myself, my wife, and my sister-in-law, our 16-year old son and 9-year old also saw the "saucer" in question.

The story by [redacted] was illustrated with several pictures, three of actual "saucers" that had been seen in various parts of the country, together with one of Mrs. Ruth Tomlinson with a "saucer" found on the lawn of her home in the town of Arlington Heights, Illinois. One of the pictures was a photograph of a man, showing a "saucer" in flight over Seattle, Washington. Our "saucer", I thought, looked more like than one. However, the descriptive matter did not indicate whether or not the Seattle "saucer" had a motor. On the other hand, the story indicated that five men, at the aureo, California, Air Base, saw bright objects at 8,000 feet, at 9:30A. M., "WHICH GAVE OFF NO SMOKE OR EXHAUST TRAIL, AND MADE NO NOISE." In another case it was said that a huge cigar-shaped object, about 100 feet long, was seen near Montgomery, Alabama, on the night of July 24, 1948, with "a reddish exhaust, and a blue flame playing along the side of the fuselage." "A Chicago man, according to the story, "said they (saucer) were visions, brought on by poor eating habits." Yet plenty of dandelion blooms, he advised, "and the saucers will disappear."

Well, for my part, I am sure of at least two things; (1) We did see the "flying saucer" as described, and (2) we do not intend to eat plenty of dandelion blooms. The story was concluded with this request, which is being complied with:

"If you should happen to see a 'saucer' - and you are sure it isn't a bird, balloon, or B-29 - write to the Technical Intelligence Division, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, and tell them all about it."

Mrs. _____, Newfoundland stated that at 2215 hours, approximately, 12 August 1950 she sighted some manner of unconventional aircraft flying in a southerly direction over the vicinity of Red Rock (a point near Flat Rock).

2. Details:

Mrs. ____ at Flat Rock, Newfoundland offers the following statements: On 12 August 1950, between 2215 and 2220 hours, I was out behind my house. I heard a fairly loud hiss, and I looked out toward Red Head (North, north-east) and I saw an object flying toward Torbay Airport (Southerly direction). It appeared to be about 110 feet up (estimated by ground distance). It was about 43 feet long, and about a foot in diameter. There was a reddish glow along the front and the rest was darkish except for a red flame behind it as long as it was. It made no reflection on the clouds. Sky was clear and bright. It moved on toward Torbay Airport and out of sight. It was going very fast. I could not say the speed.

Torbay Traffic section was checked and it was discovered that only one C-54 aircraft was in the air during the evening of 12 August 1950 at 2115 hours and again at approximately 2140 hours. No jet aircraft have been recorded in the vicinity during the month of August, to date.

Weather Station, Torbay, Newfoundland was checked for the weather on 12 August 1950 with the following results: At 2000 hours, visibility 12 miles, scattered clouds at 10,000 feet, temperature 62°, at 2200 hours sky clear, wind 12 mph, little change during the balance of the night except for a mild change in temperature.

1. Following is a summary covering the recent penetration of British air space by an aircraft not known to belong to a friendly country:

SUMMARY: An unidentified aircraft was plotted by RAF Fighter Command Control at 40,000 feet off Cromer, England (52°96'N - 010°9'E) at 1002, 14 August 1950. When two (2) Meteor jet fighters from RAF Horsham St Faith (52°40'N - 001°7'W) were scrambled to 25,000/30,000 feet, their pilots sighted two distinct vapor trails on a heading of 220 degrees. These disappeared by the time the Meteors had reached 38,500 feet. The appearance of separate trails suggested widely spaced engines to the Meteor pilots. Investigation has not resulted in identification of this aircraft.
