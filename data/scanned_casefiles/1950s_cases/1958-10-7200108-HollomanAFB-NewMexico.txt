LAS CRUCES, N.M. (UP) - An Alamogordo missile engineer reported that he saw an unidentified flying object near the Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico on Wednesday.

John Horner, identified as a missile engineer at White Sands Proving Ground, said he and four other persons saw the object for about six minutes. It hovered about 10 degrees above the horizon and then slowly disappeared behind the San Andres Mountains near Alamogordo.

Officials of both White Sands and Holloman Air Development Center said they had no reports of any flying object during that period."
