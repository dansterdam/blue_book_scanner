ALAMOGORDO, N. M. (UPI) - A cigar-shaped unidentified flying object was reported Friday night near the place where the "Dyna High" Air Force space balloon landed Wednesday.

The object was reported by John Romero, identified as a missile engineer, on White Sands Proving Ground. He said it had a fan-shaped tail and four pin-point spots of lights on the side like portholes.

Romero said he saw the object through binoculars for about six minutes. It hovered about 10 degrees above the horizon and then vanished over the San Andreas Mountains near Alamogordo.

Officials of both White Sands and Holloman Air Development Center said they knew nothing about the reported flying object.
