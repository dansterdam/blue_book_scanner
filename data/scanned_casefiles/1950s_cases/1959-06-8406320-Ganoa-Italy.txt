Genoa the 6th June 1959

To Staff of Air Base of VANDENBERG
CALIFORNIA

I am a captain tourist officer employed in the publicity office of the Lloyd
Triestino in Genoa, Italy.

At home, as I am very keen in astronomy, I have a small rainbow field glass
60 enlargements which I bought at a cheap price in Hong Kong.

In the morning of the 3rd. of this month I had at it position and was
viewing Jupiter and three of the four principal satellites, and watching for its
which position was unknown to me.

It was exactly 21:43 local time (at the clock at right 20.00 with the
time signal of Radio Roma) when in the field of observation of my glass(rose pink zone)
entered from north a luminous flying object direct southwest.

Its size was apparently that of one of the three satellites I was observing
but its light was not so bright but of a steady pale whitish colour(the sky was moonless
and sky very clear) This light was of an unchanging intensity without any sort of lumi-
nous tail.

I understood immediately it was not any sort of meteorite; not at all a plane
and I kept it under observation for what I reckoned to be 14 seconds of time,
lessening little by little among the tiniest stars it disappeared at a point which I
estimated to be more or less 20 degrees of height on the horizon.

In the following day, the 4th of June, the newspaper reported of the launching
of the "Explorer III" from Vandenberg-California at 21.09 local time(Geneva-Italy) and
that was the reason why I phoned my observation to the Geophysic Institute of the Univ.
at Genoa.

In there anything with the launching of the "Explorer III" I could see a graphic which represent quite sensibly what I have seen hoping to be
excused for not having been able to do more.

With best regards

Cap. [REDACTED] -- via [REDACTED] 2/12.A

ATTN OF: WGMB/Capt Moore/2251
SUBJECT: Letter Volunteering Information

TO: Captain [redacted]
Genova, Italy

Dear Captain:

1. Thank you for your very precise and complete astronomical observ-
vation on the night of 3 June.

2. However, you could not have been observing DISCOVERER III because
it would have been going from south to north in Genoa, instead of north
to south as you observed. In addition, DISCOVERER III with more re-
quired more than 30 minutes to reach the latitude of northern Italy
instead of the 20 minutes observed by you.

3. The excellent and concise account of your sighting made it possible
to tentatively plot the differences between the object you saw and
the path of DISCOVERER III.

4. Your interest and willingness to assist is very much appreciated.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
