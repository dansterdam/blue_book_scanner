29 March 1952                                     Misawa AFB, Japan

AT 1120 hours, 29 March 1952,an unidentified object was observed approximately 20 miles north of Misawa. This sighting was made by an Air Force Pilot flying a T-6 type aircraft. This T-6 was traveling at 6,000' altitude, one heading of 0 degrees, at 130 knots. AT the time of sighting, two F-84 type A/C were making practice runs on the T-6 area.

This object was first noticed by the pilot of the T-6 aircraft when it pulled abreast of him and reflected the sunlight. The object that had reflected the sunlight was a small, shiny disc-shaped object, and these appeared to make a pass at the F-84 at an estimated 40 to 50 knots in excess of the F-84's airspeed. It closed rapidly and just before flying into his fuselage it decelerated rapidly to his airspeed almost instantaneously. In doing so, it flipped on its edges at approximately a 90 degree bank. It then fluttered within 20 feet of his fuselage for two or three seconds, and pulled away and around his starboard wing where it was caught in the slipstream behind the aircraft and flipped once. Then it passed him; crossed in front of him and pulled away abruptly, appearing to accelerate and shot out of sight in a steep, almost vertical climb. The pilot of the F-84 didn't observe the object.

COMMENT:
No further information has been forthcoming. No explanation for this sighting can be proposed other than the possible reflection and refraction of light through the canopy of the observers aircraft.

CONCLUSION:
UNSOLVED

Date of Incl: 29 Mar 52                    Location: Belgian Congo

Recently two fiery disks were sighted over the uranium mines located in the southern part of the Belgian Congo in the Elisabethville district. The disks glided in curves and changed their position many times, so that from below they sometimes appeared as plates, ovals and simply lines. Suddenly both disks hovered in one spot, then took off in a unique zigzag flight to the NE.

Commander [redacted] of the small Elisabethville airfield immediately set out a pursuit with a fighter plane. On his approach he came within about 120 meters of one of the disks. No further identification action was taken.

1st Ind.     Headquarters WDRC, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, 10 Apr 52

Source of Information: Witness

According to the encl rept, subj observed an obj (see encl (1)), which he could not identify while at sea approx 50 to 100 miles west of San Diego, Calif. Witness was unable to determine whether the obj was a/c, balloon, or something else. Obj was observed to be round, disc-like in shape, approx 20' in diameter, metallic gray in color, and appeared to be flying at approx 525 mph at an alt of 10,000'.

Accordingly, this hq will make further investigation to determine the nature of the obj and will advise this atch when investigation is complete.

In view of the above, comments concerning this incident are invited, with view to a more complete evaluation. The report has been supplied by source.

Subj: Unconventional airborne object; sighting of

ONI COMMENT:

Although it is believed that the Source reported factual data of this sighting as he remembered them, there appears to be ample cause to suspect that the object was notably in a blurred state. This would parallel the comments made by the reporting officer. Based on previous analysis of similar sightings, it can be stated that estimates of location, speed and distance of an airborne object, particularly if obtained solely on visual perception, have very definite weaknesses. Also, it is known that a jet aircraft with afterburner in operation emits a bluish-white exhaust, elongated to give the appearance of a tail. It is unfortunate that the originating agency did not check this report again. Report will be forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for appropriate action and incorporation into the study maintained on unidentified flying objects.

3. Extracted from Fifth Air Force Mission Summary, 2 April 1952:

At 2:2110/I over 15N15, the crew of a B-26 observed 1, dull lights shaped in a square, approximately 1 mile apart. These lights appeared to be stationary and unpanded at 7000 feet altitude. This observation was from 20 miles to within 3 miles at which time the lights went out. 1 crew member states that he has made the same observation in the general area on 3 other nights.

a. Comment - No other reports have been received of any such phenomena in this area. The placement of the light in a square may indicate radio long-wire antenna carried aloft by balloons, or a visual beacon or method of communication.
