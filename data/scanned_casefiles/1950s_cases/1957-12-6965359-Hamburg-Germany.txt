FROM ASST. NAVAL ATTACHE, HAMBURG SOURCE Conventional
SUBJECT GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC - Unknown object falling in vicinity of Hamburg

BRIEF (FOR REPORTS OF MORE THAN ONE PAGE, ENTER CAREFUL SUMMARY):
Encl: (1) Translation of ltr from Professor Dr. of 6 Dec 1957

1. On 1 December 1957 about 1630 (CGT) a burning object was observed to fall in the vicinity of Hamburg. This object has been determined to be definitely non-meteorite. Source investigated the incident. The following information was obtained in personal interview and through correspondence (enclosure (1)) with source.

2. Source has stated as follows:

a. That a brightly burning object was seen to fall in the vicinity of Hamburg - several persons observed this incident at least one of whom is known to be a responsible person.

b. That this object struck the earth at an angle of about 30° above the horizontal.

c. That the point of impact was 8° - 10° in diameter and about 1° deep. The point of impact is located in a very swampy lowland area below surface soil complicated recovery operations.

d. That the grass in the vicinity of point of impact was singed and covered with a white-gray oxide residue.

e. That no actual metallic pieces were recovered - only products of combustion.

f. That analysis of residue (see enclosure (1)) with Xanes residual in quantity revealed magnesium and aluminum.

INFORMATION REPORT

CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED

FROM: ASST. NAVAL ATTACHE, HAMBURG

REPORT NO: 981-57

DATE: 18 December 1957

3. Source Information: Source is Professor Doctor [redacted], University of Hamburg. Source was very cooperative as well as objective in respect to this incident. His final conclusions are limited to the opinion that this object was not a meteor but was something constructed by man for some purpose which is not known.

Preparing Officer's Comments: Rather extensive digging operations were conducted at site by German Army Engineers - a hole about ten feet deep with expanded radius was dug. The theory that this object was a ship's signal device has been suggested, however the nearest ship model could have been no closer to point of impact than one half miles, which would seem to negate the idea that a ship device is the point of origin. The hole has been refilled and the incident is considered closed by local authorities.
