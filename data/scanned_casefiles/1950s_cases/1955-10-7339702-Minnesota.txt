16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: NONE
b. Color: glowing - white

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The document instructs the viewer to draw a picture of the object they observed, including details like wings, protrusions, trails or vapor trails, and indicating the direction of movement with an arrow. However, no drawing is present in the provided image.

18. The edges of the object were:

b. Sharply defined
c. Partly sharp, partly fuzzy
d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Again, no drawing is present in the provided image, as the document only instructed the viewer to do so if there were multiple objects.

AFOIIN-4H/set. DREPPER/yp
69216

2 DEC 1955

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object over Minneapolis, Minnesota

1. Reference is made to AIDPIB, concerning UFOB over Minneapolis, Minnesota on 21 October 1955.

2. A comprehensive analysis of the weather conditions existing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at the time of sighting, reveals the presence of a broken layer of stratocumulus clouds with a ceiling estimated at 4,980 feet.

3. After examination of the statements of the observer, they indicate that the object was sighted for approximately 10 to 15 seconds in a level flight at an estimated altitude of 4,980 feet.

The image does not contain any photograph, but rather a diagram. The diagram appears to be a radar plot or target tracking system, with concentric circles and radial lines forming a polar coordinate grid. There are various annotations and labels on the diagram, such as "IF SCOPE PHOTOS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, PLOT TILL TARGET TRACK AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE. GIVE THE TIME AND ALTITUDE (IF MEASURED) FOR EACH POINT PLOTTED. BUT THE NECESSARY RANGE SCALE ON THE DIAGRAM."

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text. 

The text in the document reads:

"We were originally running a practice intercept on a target known to be at 25 + 7 miles. The target was originally contacted at 45 + 7 miles. During this period I was on search operation, about 10 to 15 secs. Later I noticed the target tracking the same as with a range of 15 miles. I tracked it on hand control for a mile + a period of about 5 secs. Then returned to the intercept."
