CODE:

The questionnaire takes care of all descriptive and circumstance that this occurred. However, the intensity they saw the two Radars otherwise in this aircraft got stage blips on these angles which moved out a triple rate of speed. Also was the case was. I was concerned with this and will the 6c3 station to find that they also had something on this radar moving at 1000K.

12 DEC 1955

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object over Minneapolis, Minnesota

Commander
4602D Air Intelligence Service Squadron (ADC)
2nd Air Force Base
Colorado Springs
Colorado

1. Reference A1GWF16, concerning UFOB over Minneapolis, Minnesota on 21 October 1955.

2. A comprehensive analysis of the weather conditions existing in the Minneapolis area at the time of sightings revealed the presence of a temperature inversion (temperature increase) from the altitude of 33,800' to 39,200'. Also, another temperature inversion of less intensity was plotted at an altitude of 4,980'.

3. After consideration of the statements of the sources, duration of the sightings and the existence of a pronounced inversion, this case can be considered a PROBABLE OPTICAL AND POSSIBLE REFLECTION due to meteorological conditions.

The document appears to be a polar coordinate plotting chart with concentric circles and radial lines, with some handwritten notes on it. The chart is designed for tracking and plotting the movement of an object.


- page 13 -

We were originally running a practice intercept on a tgt known to be at 25° + 7 miles. The tgt was originally contacted at 45° star board + 7 miles. During this period I was on search operation. About 10 to 15 secs. later I noticed the tgt trucking the same az with a range of 15 miles. I tracked it on hand control for a miles + a period of about 5 secs. Then returned to the intercept.
