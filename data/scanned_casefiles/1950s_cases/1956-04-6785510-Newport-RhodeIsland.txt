7. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One large grapefruit-shaped object, the size of a large grapefruit, at arm's length, appeared in the north at an azimuth of approximately 350 degrees and climbed in a straight line up to an elevation of 350 degrees. It then started "whirling into the haze." Seen thru binoculars 6x30, visibility was unlimited with no surface wind at the time of the sighting.

The object was likely a letter-shaped balloon. Due to the description of the object and the fact that the object compares with similar balloons released on clear days, it was possibly generated by weather balloons.
