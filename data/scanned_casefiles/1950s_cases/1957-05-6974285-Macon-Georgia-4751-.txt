REPORT OF AERIAL PHENOMENA

At approximately 2030 hours on 5 May 1957, four airmen observed a group of unidentified objects in the sky near Macon, Georgia. The objects were described as circular in shape, emitting a bright light, and maneuvering in a manner inconsistent with conventional aircraft. The airmen reported the incident to their commanding officer, who in turn notified the nearest Air Force base.

The Air Force conducted an investigation into the sighting. Interviews with the witnesses and a review of local radar data did not provide a conclusive explanation for the objects observed. The case was subsequently included in Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects.

- The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before it suddenly disappeared.
- Mr. Doe stated that the object appeared to be hovering, and made no sound.
- No other witnesses were identified.
- No physical evidence was recovered.

Based on the witness testimony, the unidentified object observed over Macon, Georgia on May 6, 1957 remains unidentified. The object exhibited characteristics that do not match any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. The case is classified as unresolved.
