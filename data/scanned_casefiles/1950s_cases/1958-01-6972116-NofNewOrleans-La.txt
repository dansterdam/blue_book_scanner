FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

SUBJECT: Report of Soviet Earth Satellite Sighting

TO: Directorate of Special Investigations
ATTN: Lt Col Moore, AFOSI-6D

1. As result of a review of the matter stated in Comment Nr. 1, and evaluation of the data given by source, the following are submitted upon which to base a reply:

a. The Soviet satellite is a hollow, polished sphere approximately 23 inches in diameter. As such, it is in opinion of this Center that it would probably burn up between 30 - 80 miles altitude upon re-entry due to atmospheric drag.

b. It is unlikely that it would be seen as a perfect sphere if it did reach the earth intact and without fragmenting.

c. Assuming that the satellite remained intact or did not fragment upon re-entry, it would tend to strike the earth at a rather flat angle. The course rather it came straight down.

d. Information available to us indicates that the sphere entered the earth's atmosphere a few days after the incident reported by source.

e. Source states that he observed the object for 10 to 15 seconds, and was able to describe its shape and color in some detail. The sighting duration appears to be unduly long, even if the satellite arrived at terminal velocity.

2. On the basis of the above it appears improbable that the object was the Soviet satellite.

3. ATIC has no UFO report whatsoever from that area or time; visual, radar or from aircraft. This case, however, requires a UFO report.

4. Because of Congressional interest, it is requested that action be taken to contact the source, merely to determine the probable area of fall; and conduct an investigation of that area in an attempt to recover the alleged object, in accordance with paragraph 4b, AFR 200-2, dated 5 February 1958. Our comments on this matter were discussed with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. They concurred.

5. Further to the above a query has been made recently to this Center for any data on fireballs and meteorites observed in that area from Dr. Whately, metallically known for meteorite and fireball work. A number of these bodies have been observed in that area.

TO:    Commander
        Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi

1. This is in reference to a sighting of an unidentified object reported by Mr. [redacted] of Dallas, Texas, on 6 January 1958. On that date, the report was made to a special agent of the 23rd District OSI at Carswell AFB, Texas.

2. As forwarded by the OSI, this report stated that Mr. [redacted] and two nephews were enroute from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on U.S. Highway 11, about 1950 hours, 2 January 1958, when they spotted a slowing object falling towards the earth at approximately 1000 feet, one to one and one-half miles ahead of them. The report went on to describe the location of the sighting and other pertinent data, and was forwarded by the 23rd District OSI to the Director of Special Investigations, Washington, D.C.

3. Mr. [redacted] then wrote to Senator Lyndon B. Johnson stating that what he saw was "definitely Sputnik II", that he was positive the object was the satellite, and asking Senator Johnson's aid in pushing an investigation. Due to this Congressional interest, this has been requested to contact Mr. [redacted] for determining the object's exact point of impact with the earth's surface. Enclosure No. 1 is a report of the requested interview with Mr. [redacted] and his nephew.

4. This report is considered necessary in view of the facts uncovered by this interview with Mr. [redacted].

REPORT OF INTERVIEW WITH MR. [redacted]

The purpose of this report is to describe the results and impressions obtained by the undersigned during an interview on 26 March 1958 with Mr. [redacted] of Dallas, Texas, and his nephew, Mr. [redacted] also of Dallas. The interview was conducted to determine the point of impact of an unidentified flying object reported by these two gentlemen on 6 January 1958. Much affirmity was encountered in making initial contact with the two sources as neither of them was listed in Dallas directories. It should also be stated at the outset that Mr. [redacted] recently suffered a nervous breakdown and may not have been at peak mental efficiency during the interview. However, Mr. [redacted] appeared perfectly sound in every respect.

The general impression obtained from the interview was that the reliability of the initial sighting should be reconsidered in the light of the facts that will be stated in this report. (U)

At the time of the initial report, both men stated that they had "seen Sputnik I fall". They seemed very sure of this. However, when asked at this interview what they had seen they replied that they could not be sure, "it may have been an airplane light, a falling star, or reflection of some kind." Though they reported initially the the object had fallen "straight down", during this interview they seemed to agree that it fell across their line of vision at an angle of approximately 60 to 75 degrees with the earth's surface. As to the size of the object, which was initially reported as being "24 inches in diameter", they stated that it was impossible to estimate the size with any accuracy, saying that it could have been "as big as a television set, or as big as a house." Mr. [redacted] described the object as being perfectly round and glowing on all sides, but Mr. [redacted] stated that it appeared to be more irregular in shape and that it was glowing only on the underside. Both agreed that the object was soundless and that the glow appeared to have stopped when the object passed from their line of vision behind some trees, and apparently struck the earth. (U)

It seemed that the reason both men were initially so sure that what they had seen must be Sputnik I was the fact that they had been hearing on the radio news all day that the Soviet satellite was expected to fall at any time. It was also noted that they had done through a great change in attitude on this matter. Originally they had delayed reporting the object for four days and then had waited six more days to request Congressional assistance. But in this interview they repeated several times that as far as they were concerned the matter was a thing of the past, that they were not particularly concerned about it either way, and that they were not particularly interested in the disposition of their report. (U)

REPORT OF INTERVIEW WITH MR. (CONT'D)

Later, in a private interview with Mr. had been unemployed for quite some time. During this period he had been doing a good deal of reading about the earth satellites and apparently became quite obsessed with the idea in general. After reporting that he had seen Sputnik I fall, Mr. became convinced that his telephone was being tapped and did not use it for several weeks for fear of releasing some important information. (C)

With the above interview in mind, and with the impression I received of the two men, it is my opinion that this UFOB report should be viewed with more skepticism. (U)

This report is classified Confidential because it indicates impressions obtained by the interviewing officer. (U)

Dear Senator Johnson:

Further reference is made to your inquiry concerning Mr. [redacted] of Dallas, Texas, who claims to have seen Sputnik No. 1 return to earth just north of New Orleans, Louisiana.

Since furnishing you information on 15 March 1958, the air force has made a further examination of this incident and has interviewed Mr. [redacted] in order to secure additional detailed information. Although all facts surrounding the incident have been carefully studied, nothing was found which would indicate the authenticity of the object sighted by Mr. [redacted] Sputnik No. 1.

Sun. Jan 12, 58

Dear [redacted],

We saw what definitely was Sputnik No. 1 fall Jan 2nd at 7:50 PM (Thursday) just north of New Orleans. This is a desolate locality with swamps etc. This object fell about one mile in front of us, straight down and we were able to view it for 10 or 15 seconds. It was a perfect sphere with a glow around it and a circle itself was white. Having worked in an aluminum heat treating dept. during the war I am familiar with heated metals, I reported to the Air Force here in Dallas and then I also gave details to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass.

They all expressed doubt that they would search for this.

My two nephews and myself are lifelong residents of Dallas and certainly know there is no reward collected with finding this satellite. We know that finding the satellite would be of immense scientific value as well as historical. We have written this information from the press thinking, maybe the government wanted to keep it a secret for awhile.

We haven't been shown the courtesy of advising us whether they are looking for this, not and we don't want the report.

Being supporters of yours we will leave the decision up to you. After you've seen the full report of this (Dallas OSI report), may we then get out to Walsh, you may advise us accordingly. If you want to release this to the press we give permission or if you want to keep it a secret we will do likewise.

I am 45 years old and have seen comets, meteors, falling stars, and they all say this didn't. You may be sure that we are positive this was the satellite. Please advise.

Yours Sincerely
