Hydrogeographic Bulletin Ten

METEORS

The Hydrogeographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying meteors. Mariners reporting their observations of these bodies are greatly assisting in this work. It is desired to have the Greenwich time and point of observation, and geographic position as nearly as possible. Observers are requested to send their observations on long-enduring trains and their direction of drift and other special information as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.

- NORTH PACIFIC

Second Officer C. A. Olver of the American SS. Hawaiian Refiner, Capt. H. O. Matthiesen, Master, reports that at 1612 G.M.T., November 29, 1953, a large meteor was observed which appeared at an altitude of 20° bearing 290°. The meteor, which was greenish in color and a little larger than Jupiter, moved slowly from west to north in a slight downward direction and then became brighter, breaking in two, the smaller portion falling rapidly. The phenomenon was visible for approximately 7 seconds.

Weather clear, wind northerly force 1, barometer 30.34 inches, air temperature 66° F., wet bulb 63° F.

NORTH ATLANTIC

Second Officer Julio A. Lopez of the Argentine M.V. Rio Lujan, Capt. D. Carabelli Montero, Master, reports the following observation:

On November 30, 1953, at 0154 G. M. T., in lat. 7°49' N., lon. 25°33' W., a very brilliant meteor was observed. The body appeared at 65° altitude and disappeared about 2 seconds later, leaving a very brilliant greenish-blue trail that glowed for about 4 minutes after the meteor's disappearance.

Sky partly cloudy, wind N.E. force 3, barometer 29.94 inches, air temperature 80° F.
