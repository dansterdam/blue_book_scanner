AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Cairo, New Delhi, India                     Report No. 127760                     Page 2 of 2

1. On 21 July 1959, Mr. [redacted] 2d Secretary Economic of this Embassy, attached the following by Office Memorandum, "At about 9 P.M. on Tuesday, July 14, 1959, I observed some strange lights passing through the sky, which I thought might be worth reporting to you. My family and I were sitting on our front terrace after dinner when I noticed a light moving across the sky at considerable speed. I thought at first that it was an airplane, but then became aware of the following characteristics: The light was so bright and so plainly visible that it seemed to have come from an airplane flying at less than 2,000 feet and less than one mile distant. Such an airplane would have been readily audible but was heard no sound. The light travelled from the left side to the right side of my field of vision; an airplane travelling that direction would show its green starboard light - this light was a steady light orange-red, about the brightness of a medium bright star. It moved in a straight line from east to west, about 40° - 50° above the horizontal. I was looking south and first noticed it at a compass heading of about 170° and lost it at about 230°. We would not have thought more about it except that during the next 15 minutes we saw six more lights, all of the same color, but with varying brightness and all moving in a straight line without sound. All disappeared as if they had been extinguished. The second light moved in the same direction as the first, but at a slightly lower altitude; the next two were to the east or northeast moving in a northeasterly direction at slightly different elevations; the next moved from north to south, to the west of us, one moved from west to east (disappearing when it reached a point about due south or us), and the last moved east to west, also to the south at about 85°, there was a light breeze from the east, the sky was clear except for a small patch of fluffy clouds to the south and a low front in the west."

2. COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:
The Indian Air Force weather Station at Palam Airport, New Delhi (within ten miles of the sighting) had a 15° temperature inversion between 3,000 and 5,000 feet at 1500 Indian Standard Time on 14 July 1959. At 2200 Indian Standard Time, the weather station did not show an inversion.
