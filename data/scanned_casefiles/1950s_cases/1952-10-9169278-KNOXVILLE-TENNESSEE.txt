EXTRACT OF REPORT FROM WEATHER BUREAU AIRPORT STATION
KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE, DATED OCTOBER 21, 1952

Observed unexplained aerial phenomena while following a 100-gram pibal balloon with the standard Weather Bureau theodolite. Six white or whitish objects in a very loose formation appeared in the theodolite vision field. These were sighted 57 minutes after release of the standard white 100-gram pibal balloon. This would give an altitude of 16,565 meters, or 54,347 feet MSL. The elevation angle was 36.5° and the azimuth angle was 267.6°.

While holding the loose formation of two, three, one, objects appeared to execute a long shallow dive at the rising balloon, such as to investigate it. Formation appeared to pass the balloon and pulled up a sharper angle than the diving approach and at increased speed. Pibal balloon disappeared from view at 58,022 feet MSL. Could have burst.

FACTS AS OBSERVED

Shape - appeared round, or nearly so.
Color - white or whitish near the shades of the balloon.
Size - appeared about the same size as the balloon at that altitude.
Sighted - one and one-half to one and three-quarter minutes.
