7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
20 - 40 minutes

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A round to crescent shaped object, orange in color, was sighted in the East just above the horizon. The three pilots were of the opinion object was the moon. However, obj supposedly picked up on ground radar also.

2. LOCATION
Guthrie & Parkersburg, West Virginia

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

6. SOURCE
Military

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
stationary

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Astronomical MOON

11. COMMENTS
The moon was approaching 1/4 (first quarter) on 14th, sighting on 11th. Direction of obj and moon coincided. No witness indicated seeing obj & moon at same time. WX inversion probably present. Some inversion distorting radar returns WX or ground objects. The pilots no doubt saw the moon. The radar paint was probably caused by effects of inversion which distorted visual observation of moon.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: United States
REPORT NO: IR-1-57
AREA REPORT CONCERNS: Parkersburg, Ohio
AGENCY OF ORIGIN: 58th Air Division (Defense)
DATE OF REPORT: 17 December 1957
SOURCE OF INFORMATION: 2nd Lt Wayne A. Rhoades, 783rd ACWRON Avenger White Flight, 87th FIS
DATE OF INFORMATION: 11 December 1957
PREPARING OFFICER: JUANITA MANCHA, 2nd Lt, USAF
EVALUATION: B-2

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report

SUMMARY:
An unidentified flying object was sighted on 12/030Z approximately over Parkersburg, Ohio, Airborne sighting was by Avenger White Flight, 3 F-86L's, out of Lockbourne AFB, Ohio. Ground sighting was on search radar by the intercept controller at 783rd ACWRON, Guthrie, West Virginia.

Reports indicate that the object was almost circular and was an orange color. The pilots report that the object did not move and only change appearance to be in range. However, the object moved erratically on the radar scope and was estimated at a speed of reach 1.5. It remained in sight from 20 to 30 minutes.

It is possible that the pilot sighting was the moon and that radar returns was from a low flying aircraft or radar noise. Correlation between radar observed position and pilot sighting indicate otherwise.

10. Location of any air traffic in the area at the time of sighting:
Lockbourne AFB, operations stated that several B-47's landed shortly after 0400, 12 Dec 57, and were possibly in the local area for a period of time before landing.

11. Position Title and Comments of the Preparing Officer, including his preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting:
Lt Wayne A. Rhoades, Senior Director.

Airborne sighting was by Avenger White flight, 3 F84L's. USOB was first observed when White 3 noticed orange glowing object at one o'clock position. He was 20 miles west of Parkersburg, Ohio heading 090°0 at 25,000 feet climbing. He was informed that the moon was up and that it could be the moon. He said it was not. At that time we spotted a radar blip 10 miles east of Parkersburg moving toward the flight at estimated 1.5 mach. Movement was erratic, sometimes hovering, then running, speed. As it neared flight, pilot and radar position reports agreed, and pilot said object was crescent shaped, orange-red and glowing. Object on radar appeared to join Flight at Parkersburg. Its radar appearance was less intense than that of an aircraft and it faded from time to time.

Flight turned north, then northwest to Lockbourne. Last radar contact was 20 miles north of Parkersburg. Last pilot contact was 30 miles south of Lockbourne. Pilot was heading 350°. Object was following in 5 o'clock position.

It is possible that pilot sighting was the moon and that radar return was from a low-flying aircraft or rain noise. Correlation between radar observed position and pilot sighting indicate otherwise.
