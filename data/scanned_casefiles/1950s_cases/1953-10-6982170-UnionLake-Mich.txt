RADAR OBSERVATIONS
INDIAN OCEAN

Second Officer P. Fribert of the Danish M.V. Jane Macrak, Capt. H. E. Pedersen, Master, reports the following radar observations obtained on the southeast coast of Arabia:

On November 1, 1953, at 2245 G. M. T. in approximate position lat. 19°58' N, lon. 69°48' E, the coastline of Barr al Hikman, bearing 327° 32 miles distant, showed a well defined outline on the radar screen, while the hills on southern Masirah Island near Ra's Abu Rosas, bearing 340°, only 18 miles distant gave very weak returns.

On a former voyage it was noted that the hills on northern Masirah gave very weak returns while the coastline of the mainland gave a good return up to 30 miles.
