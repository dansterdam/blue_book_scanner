Texas

The initial two items have been retained by this unit and have been
placed in our local intelligence files.

After compiling all of the above information an extensive investigation
was undertaken by Intelligence personnel of this unit. The following narrative was the finding of this investigation.

An attempt was made to identify the objects. Calls to the newspapers
and local radio stations revealed no previous knowledge of any aircraft in
the area. A check with the Naval Office at Chance-Vought Aircraft Corporation
in Dallas, Texas, revealed that while they had no record of any aircraft in
the local office, said Chance-Vought had no attempt to recover the site of the
sighting. A local radio station was contacted and information of their first knowledge of the object was obtained from local radio broadcasts.

In an endeavor to contact the Dallas Police Department to check on
the information they received, the local police officer who first sighted the
object learned that one of the local Dallas Police Department officers had
also sighted the object at his home and saw the object disappear at 1800*.

It is not believed that the object sighted by [redacted] was an aircraft in the strict sense of the word. Considerable time was spent investigating. Officers from the local police department gave one of the height, speed, and other characteristics. All appear to change colors.

Proceeded next to contact the two local newspapers to see what information they had on the unusual object. [rest of paragraph appears partially illegible]

THE DALLAS TIMES HERALD, DALLAS, JAN. 6, 1953
FIERY THINGS SIGHTED HERE

A bright, colorful object hung in the skies north and northeast of Dallas
several hours early Tuesday.

Scores of watchers saw the object, but many doubted it was a plane,
planet or a star.

Watchers at the Civil Aeronautics Administration control tower at Love
Field, a weather bureau observer and police and fire station dispatchers reported seeing the "luminous", "strange moving", "reddish-white, orange, red, green and blue-white colored" [text continues but partially obscured]

when he first sighted the light.

"APPEARED TO CHANGE COURSE"

"I watched it travel as it seemed to approach out by northeast. It seemed to change its course as if trying to avoid being held."

Through a pair of 7x50-power binoculars [redacted] said the object appeared to have "yellowish" wings (seems like on modern jet planes) and that it seemed to hover east and northeast of the field.

He estimated its closest approach at about 50 miles away and 2,000 feet high.

The Love Field tower also reported a relay message from Oklahoma saying the flight of the object had been picked up there on radar at a speed estimated in excess of 600 miles an hour.

A report in Dallas that a jet plane was trying to chase the object large about 5 a.m. was unconfirmed. Military officials denied any jets were in the area. The Love Field tower, however, had reports from other pilots following the object.

"TOO FANTASTIC"

[redacted] fire department radio dispatcher, said he and other firemen viewed the object after receiving a call from the Love Field tower.

"Wish I'd never seen it," he said. "It's too fantastic, and now that I'm a lot of talk. I just wish I'd never seen it."

Looking out an east window at City Hall about 2:30 a.m., [redacted] said the object appeared to be floating a little above the near-by Western Union bldg.

It began to rise as he watched, "changing colors like a diamond," he said.

[redacted], meteorologist at the Dallas weather station, said he watched the object through a six-power telescope.

"It looked elongated, as if it was vertical - standing on end - and it had a definite transmission of discolors. At first it changed color rapidly, from white to blue and then red and green. Later it maintained white with a red spot on its underside."

"BELIEVES IN SAUCERS"

"I believe in flying saucers," [redacted] asserted. "And this was a saucer ship for smaller saucers traveling in our orbit."

Another tower controller at Love Field, estimated the object was 20,000 feet, then 50,000 feet, and then 112,000 feet. He estimated it came up to 50,000 feet.

To said a number of pilots gathered in the tower to watch the spectacle.
said had been a pilot for 27 years, worked in the tower for 14
years, and would know a plane or a star by now. "This wasn't a chance."

Military Officers at Dallas Naval Air Station, Greeley Field and the
Duncanville radar station said the object was not seen by any personnel at
those stations.

The Perrin Air Force Base at Sherman, however, reported sighting an "un-
identified object."

Police Dispatcher [REDACTED] said he had several calls on the mystery
object at 2 a.m. and that a number of cruising police cars also began call-
ing in.

Dispatcher [REDACTED] and several policemen climbed to the roof of City Hall.
"It looked like a big star, but it seemed to change colors," he declared.

FIRST BEAUTIFUL

Through a 40-power telescope the object appeared "as an arrow" in shape.
"We had most of the ship in view," the report said. "It was a red glow
toward the front, the wings blue and the center white. It moved forward and
then backward and seemed to be going higher all the time."

[REDACTED] said the colors were "the most beautiful I've ever seen."

First report on the mystery object came to Iowa Field at 7:30 p.m. from
a man in Paris, Tex. The first radar contact was on a channel checked, on
which he believed was traveling at an altitude of 3,500 feet, to Cooper, Tex.

Commenting on the possibility that what the watchers saw might have been
a planet, Venus, or Jupiter, the Iowa Field astronomer said only
two planets, Jupiter and Venus, were at all bright this time of the year.

LITTLE CHANCE OF MIXTURE

Venus, he said, sets at 9 p.m. and Jupiter about midnight. No
believed skilled observers, such as many who report seeing the object,
could have possibly have mistaken these planets for anything else.

Capt. [REDACTED], public information officer at Dallas Naval Air
Station, said no reports of a sighting were made by the control tower watch
that day.

Nor was there any report from watch standers at Hensley Field on a
sighting. Major [REDACTED] was down for maintenance at the Duncanville radio sta-
tion. There was no watch observers there, however, did not see the object.

After reading the above article we called up [REDACTED] to verify his
veracity. The statement was found to be substantially correct. It said that
exponents in every respect. The following is [REDACTED] statement of
his observations.

"I first saw the light at 0205 GCT north of the tower. The only color visible at this time was red. I didn't say any attention to it, thinking it might be an airplane, looking lack again I noticed the light had moved somewhat to the southwest. As I watched, the light seemed to be moving toward the tower. What led up to this was that the first occasion I saw the light, it was a very bright red light. At this time the light hovered for about ten minutes. I noticed the light to be 30 miles an hour about 1500 feet. At this time, so therefore my estimate could be wrong. After viewing while the light moved somewhat erratically and then moving east."

[Redacted text] asked to describe the object and to give an approximate size, Mr. [redacted] said:

"I cannot give the size of the object. At first sight, without him use of binoculars, the object looked like a star. However, as soon as I used the binoculars, I noticed the object had a definite shape and was moving in the stretch I knew the object had many colors. Because of the probability of some sort of light during, I thought it might have been a UFO or possibly some kind of gathering plane. The outer edges of the object were very well defined, whereas, the trailing edge with the colors changing from red to orange have tried to give us an accurate description of the object as possible."

[Redacted text] description is the best to have able to get of all the sources of information.

A study of the weather conditions at the time of the sighting revealed the sky conditions were clear with a 15 mile visibility, temperature - 50.2° Dew Point - 47.00, and humidity - 65%. As to the wind velocity, we were able to obtain the readings for 00017: They were: 2000 Ft - 200 at 13, 10,000 Ft - 270 at 13, 20,000 Ft - 300 at 22, 50,000 Ft - 270 at 31, 30,000 Ft - 220 at 31.

CASE #23
6 January 1953

Dallas, Texas

On 6 Jan 53 between the hours of 0102M and 1130M various reports were received on visual observation in the general vicinity of Dallas, Texas. The object was reported from two Air Force bases one at Duncanville, Texas, and the other at Prairie, Texas.

Here is the description of the object that appeared at Prairie, Texas. Object was color winged in shape with large round openings in the center which changed color from orange to red. The nose section was bluish-green, wings were brilliant white, tail section was fuzzy and changed color from orange to red to blue. The tail section was not as bright as the rest of the object. The wing tips and nose would make a triangle and the tail section extended to rear of the triangle. No trail or exhaust or system of propulsion was noted. The speed of the object was noted as follows: the object covered a 90 degree arc in 3 minutes about 50 miles north of Dallas - no speed in miles per hour could be given. There was no sound reported. Maneuvers consisted mostly of straight and level flight. In one instance it however made a slight curve then went practically straight up and disappeared by blending in with the stars. This was sighted at 0105CST to 0200CST. The method of observation was visual from ground and the location was 50 miles north of Dallas. The intelligence officer at Hensley Field, Grand Prairie, Texas, reported there was no evidence which could have caused the sighting. Interception or identification action taken was that all radar in the area were notified. Oklahoma City Municipal Air Port reported radar contact with object in the vicinity, reported on and gave estimated speeds of over 600 MPH. The location of air traffic in the area: 1 EC-3 three miles NE of Love Field, Dallas, Texas at 700 feet altitude reported no observation.

Here is a report received from Duncanville, Texas; 6 Jan 53 between hour of 0102M and 1130M a mysterious light was seen in some the sky northeast of Dallas. Numerous in many instances, reports conflicted with each other. One report would give the heading of the object as south while another would give the heading in a different direction. The altitude of the object also varied in the many reports. Once the area became aware of the sightings, reports conflicted with each other.

CASE 251 (contd - page 2)

of something unusual in the air, reports came in more frequently. The object was first sighted at Paris, Texas, and was last seen by spotters at Dallas, Texas.

At 0710 5 Jan 53, MOCKINGBIRD the reporting unit was notified by the CAA ARTCC at Meacham Field, Fort Worth, Texas, that they had received numerous calls of an unidentified flying object NE of Dallas, Texas. Upon notification of the above information, officer on duty contacted Love Field traffic Control Tower at Dallas for verification of the sighting. Civilian at Love Field tower said that the object could be seen from Dallas. The officer then notified the Controller at Hq 3920 Air Division (Defense) of the above situation.

Soon after the initial call, a civilian of Paris, Texas, called and stated that he had observed a mysterious object at 0130K over Paris. He chased the object with his car for thirty minutes to Cooper, Texas. He estimated the object to be at an altitude of 3500 feet.

Civilian also sighted the object at about 0430Z.

A radar unit at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, reported that they had picked up a target by radar 21 miles SW of Paris, Texas. The target then moved to a point 3 miles E of Bonham, Texas, which is about 35 miles W of Paris, Texas. The target was moving W at an estimated air speed of 600 knots and at an altitude of 7500 feet. The time of the initial radar pickup was 0305Z. Eleven minutes later, at 0316Z, the object faded. No other radar contacts were made in that area which could be linked to the unusual target observed by the civilian at Paris.

The direction of the radar target, West, and the direction of the object seen by the civilian South, do not concur and, therefore, are evidently 2 different objects.

The radar contact is believed to have been an aircraft heading for Perrin AFB, Texas.

No identification can be made on civilian's sightings.

ATIC Comments: It is believed that one of the objects seen observed visually was the upper air research balloon launched at Pyote, Texas, and the radar pickup was jet a/c in the area.

was noted. The speed of the object was noted as follows: the object covered a 90 de-
gree arc in [3] minutes about 50 miles north of Dallas - no speed in miles per hour could
be given. There was no sound reported. Maneuvers consisted mostly of straight and true
level flight. In one instance it hovered, made a slight curve then went practically
straight up and disappeared by blending in with the stars. This was sighted at 0105CST
to 0300CST. The method of observation was visual from ground and the location was 50
miles north of Dallas. The intelligence officer at Beasley Field, Grand Prairie, Texas,
reported there was no evidence which could have caused the sighting. Interception or
identification action taken was that all radar in the area were notified. Oklahoma City
Municipal Air Port reported radar contact with object in the vicinity, reported on end

The target then moved to a point 3 miles S of Bonham, Texas, which is about 35 miles W of Paris, Texas. The target was heading W at an estimated air speed of 600 knots and at an altitude of 7500 feet. The time of the initial radar pickup was 0605Z. Eleven minutes later, at 0616Z, the object faded. No other radar contacts were made in that area which could be linked to the unusual target observed by the civilian at Paris.

The direction of the radar target, West, and the direction of the object seen by the civilian, South, do not concur and, therefore, are evidently 2 different objects.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

On 6 January 1953, between the hours of 0302 and 1337, a mysterious light was seen in the sky northwest of Dallas, Texas. In early instances reports conflicted with each other. One report would give the heading in one south while another would give the heading in a different direction. The pilot of the object also varied in the same report.

Once the area became aware of something unusual in the air, reports came in more frequently. The object was first sighted at Paris, Texas, and was last seen by spotters at Dallas, Texas.

Whether or not there is any tangible explanation to these sightings, it is not known. However it is believed some way have identified some of the sightings through our local investigation, which we hope will assist in the current investigation being undertaken by the Air Force in exploring the many "Flying Saucer" reports.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

117th ACw Squadron, Duncanville,
                Texas

On 27Jan on the 26th of January 1953, this unit was notified by the 5th
Air Force at Perrin AFB, Fort Worth, Texas, that they had received information
of an unusual sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area. Investigation of the above information, 1st Lt. [redacted] Director of
the Operational Plans & Training, Tactical Recon at Dallas for verification on
the sighting.   [redacted] from Hicks Field Tower said that the object
was tracked from [redacted] to the 33rd Air Division (Defense) of the situation.

Soon after the initial call, [redacted] of [redacted] Texas called
and stated that he had observed a very strange object at 0200, traveling
ahead the object with him for thirty minutes to George, Texas. He described
the object at about 0.5302.

[redacted] calling again from Sheppard Tower at Sherman, Texas, and was told
by [redacted] that an American Airlines Operations Operator, that he had seen the
craft's path might going east.

The ACW unit at Ticker AFB, Oklahoma reported in that they had picked up
a target by radar twenty one miles southwest of Paris, Texas. The target then
moved to a point three miles east of Paris, Texas, which is the thirty-five
mile east of Paris, Texas. The target was leaving east at an estimated air
speed of 100 knots and at an altitude of approximately 17,000 feet. The time
of the initial radar pickup was 0032, eleven minutes later, at 0043, the
object faded. A closer radar contact was made in the last three miles and
limited to the unusual target observed by the civilian at Paris.

The direction of the radar target, west, and its direction of the object
seen by the civilian, south, to southwest, was different. The civilian saw two
different objects. The radar direct is believed to have been an aircraft heading
for Perrin AFB, Texas, to Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas.

[redacted] at Love Field, Dallas called and gave a brief description of the object. It would be hard to give a more precise description. It was
shown like a [redacted]. A strangely driven car was next to Love Field to aid
up the search and other information. The following two have been a verification
