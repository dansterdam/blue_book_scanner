REPLY TO
ATTN OF: 376X001                                                27 August 1959

SUBJECT: Identification of Falling Object

TO: ATIC (Major [redacted])

1. The enclosed glass object fell from the sky, at approximately 1300 hours on Friday, 21 August 1959, and was discovered 17 miles NW of Marysville, Ohio (coordinates 4022N 82211). This glass plate fell on the roof of a house and landed at the Test of Mr. [redacted], County Civilian Defense head who contacted the Air Base. This glass object was furnished to a member of the Intelligence Division, 376th Bombardment Wing, at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio on Tuesday, 25 August.

2. Weather conditions were reportedly good at the time and no aircraft were visible or heard at the time the object landed nor were any aircraft heard immediately prior to the time the object fell.

3. Investigation by the Intelligence Division of this headquarters reveals the following information:

a. Size: 53 x 107 mm.
b. Gage: Standard plate glass.
c. Color: Red tinted on both sides.
d. Surface: Smooth, with four ground lines intersecting at the center of the glass forming an eight pointed star.
e. Condition: Good, except broken into three parts which match together perfectly except for one missing broken sliver of glass. The edges appear carbonized as if this glass was subjected to extreme heat.

4. The Journal Tribune, in Marysville, Ohio published a picture of this object on Monday, 24 August. The article erroneously listed the date of the fall as Saturday, 22 August rather than 21 August. A copy of the article is included as Inclosure 2. The newspaper, Ohio. No publicity releases have been requested or released by this station.

5. Examination of this glass by T/sgt Charles E. Robinson, 376th Armament and Electronics Squadron of this station, reveals the following information:

"This item appears to be a water house stop that could be used in conjunction with the O-23 Radar Recording Camera or the O-22 Radar Recording Camera. These type cameras do not have built-in diaphragms, therefore different size water house stops may be used to allow the amount of light passing through and exposing the film to be varied. This would be extremely valuable in high altitude, high speed aircraft using the above mentioned cameras if used for taking optical photographs in conjunction with a bombing system."

6. The carbonization of the glass and apparent melting of the glass may have been caused by air friction as would be generated by extremely high speed air from a free fall from extreme altitudes.

7. Personnel at North American Aircraft, Columbus, Ohio, informed us that they had no photo equipped aircraft in the area at that time. Aircraft assigned to this base do not use this type equipment.

8. Colonel Vitumak (telephone 54204), when contacted at Wright Patterson AFB, advised that the glass be forwarded for further examination.

9. If unclassified, request that a copy of the results of your determination as to the source of this falling object be forwarded to this station in order that a letter of appreciation may be forwarded to the finder. The information for a follow-up story and at the same time desires to publish information advising his readers of the procedure to be followed in the event further objects should be found or have already been found but not reported.

Here is the text from the document:

What is It?

Satellite or saucer souvenir? State Civil Defense headquarters will be asked for an opinion. This four- by two-inch red-stained heat-marred glass, etched with a seven-point star was a ball from the blue Saturday for Arnold Wiley, Richwood R. 1. Wiley was coming around the house where it hit the roof and fell on the ground near him. He said there was no plane in sight and he didn't hear anything. He turned the glass over to Robert Gordon, county CD head, who said he would send it to Columbus.
