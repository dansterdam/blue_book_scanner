PROJECT 1073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE
24 June 1957

3. DATE-TIME GROUP
Local 0200

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual TX

5. PHOTOS
□ Yes
■ No

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
one

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One object, round, size of dime, color
reddish. Object first nor seen only
lights--the lights were like pinpoints
of light. Object in shape of circle. Object
sharply bobbing up & down - disappeared
at 235 dgr azimuth. 35 dgr elev.
Entered 36 dgr elevation 310 azimuth.
Estimated distance 10 miles observed
through TX.

2. LOCATION
Guam

6. SOURCE
Navy, signal tower

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

11. COMMENTS
Traveled through 25 dgr arc bobbing up & down in one minute.
Observation through TX accounts for
bobbing up and down. Speed, lateral flight and lights are consistent w/analysis of avg. jet
at 40,000 with speed of 400 knots
at 15 miles fits this situation.
Disappearance due to clouds.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
□ Unknown

20/1302, BY THE U. S. WEATHER BUREAU, BUT THE TIME INTERVAL 
BETWEEN THE SFOB SIGHTING AND RADIOSONDE RELEASE MAKES THIS 
IDENTIFICATION UNLIKELY.
