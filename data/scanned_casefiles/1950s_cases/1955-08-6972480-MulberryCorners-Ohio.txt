Case File Number Three

On September 20, 1955 I received a letter from one Mrs. ******* of Cleveland which stated that she had visited with a young man who had had an amazing experience. She went on to say that this fellow told only his mother, his priests and her about the event but that he wanted to talk with someone who knows about such things. Soon after, I accompanied two other UFO investigators to Mrs. ******* home where the interview was to take place. With the witness' okay we recorded the complete interview with a dictaphone.

The witness' name is ************* a pleasant 21 year old fellow who, at first impression, appeared most sincere. Following is a reproduction of *************** affidavit account:

"My name is ***************, Apartment 4B, I reside at *********** , Cleveland 8, Ohio.

On Tuesday morning, August 29, 1955 between 1:30 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. I was operating my automobile in a Westerly direction on Chardon Rd., Route 6.

About two miles west of the intersection of Route 6 and 306 I saw what looked like a shooting star enter my right windshield. I parked my car on the right side of Route 6 and looked to the North-east into the field where the object seemed to hit.

I thought this object might have been a meteorite and therefore walked through the field for a closer examination. When I was about 450 feet into the field and near the object I saw that the object was some kind of aircraft. It was about thirty feet in diameter and had a dome on top.

I began to get scared, turned, and ran back towards the road. I had run about fifty feet when a green light bolted out in front of me. It turned around facing the aircraft and was then unable to move my body, yet, I could speak as the green light shown on me.

A door slid open in this aircraft, some kind of platform came out, and a man, with something resembling a ski suit on, emerged from the object. This man told me not to be afraid, that 'they' had landed there to be discovered but didn't expect anyone to find them so soon. He told me to tell a high official or somebody with governmental authority in Washington that 'they' were from another planet and that there were more wars here to 'them' would have to take over. He told me that I couldn't tell all the time of the meetings. I told him that I didn't think that a kid like myself would be believed if I approached an official and relayed

message. He told me I had a week to make an effort to do this and that I'd be watched and that no harm would come to me.

He returned to the aircraft. I watched the door close; then I turned and walked back to the car. I did not see the aircraft take off.

I returned to this place on Thursday morning about the same time. This time the man told me that I had not begun to make an effort toward going to Washington. I said I had told my mother. He said I should go to Washington and relay the message.

I returned here again late Saturday night with a buddy; we waited around for a while but nothing happened.

---

Of course we realize that this case might be considered on the fantastic side but we of the UFOIC do not consider it to be in the crackpot category. A short while after the initial interview **** and drove us to the landing site at the intersection of Routes 6 and 306. He showed us his path into the desolate field and where the object alighted. We made diagrams, etc., of all of this. In late October, UFOIC members went to the site again with equipment but without Dave. Here is the contents of this field report:

1. No radioactivity found anywhere: a check with a geiger-counter revealed except for background count. (Of course, this was some time after the actual occurrence.)

2. The largest compass deviation was 10 degrees at a gully on western border of field.

3. No ground marks.

4. Photographs were taken of the area and stakes were driven into the ground as markers."

We kept in constant touch with **** and he appeared very cooperative and sincere. He was obsessed with the notion that he must get the messages given him to Washington. On October 21, 1955 we asked David more questions via telephone. Here is the text of that interview:

1. Q-Please describe the green light you told me you saw over the trees in the sky when you got out of your car? (This was an attempt to trip Dave's hand if he was lying for he told us before that he saw the light while the object was on the ground.)

A-I did not see the green light in the sky. The green light came from the ship when it was on the ground.

On October 24th of 1955, a Mr. Desmond Leslie, English writer and investigator of "Flying saucers," was to be in Cleveland for a lecture. Some three feet, that a Cleveland promoter had had an unusual experience got back to Mr. Ear———— and was asked to appear on the program. Investigated some of this and I recommended that he not appear after all after accomplish, I said, was a lot of publicity. I felt ———— it would assured me he would not attend. This, I thought, would be a good test of ————— —————— intentious and veracity.

I attended the latter part of the Desmond Leslie lecture sure enough he made an announcement about "a Clevelander who had an amazing experience recently." Leslie then asked ——— to come onto the stage and tell his story. ———— did not appear of course because he wasn't there - proving to us that he was sincere in his intentions. This was a typical demonstration of ———— willingness to cooperate with us.

During the middle part of November we invited ——— to one of our council meetings. At this meeting we discussed the project tape recorded interviews and then each member cross examined ———. Then he was asked to leave and we debated for about forty minutes. Our conclusion was that —————— that was factual in the telling of his amazing experience and that we should try to ———— ———— ———— ———— ———— ———— in his——— ———— to get this message to the right.

It is conclusive to note that both incidents(case

each other. ------- claims that the “man” told him;

Reactions of Our Group to the Witness

An investigator for the Hooper Homes Bureau, Inc., investigated ------ and his background. He informed us
that ------ teachers rated him as a good student and that he demonstrated good character and had creative writing ability.
At school he wrote radio scripts and was editor of the school
paper. He was said to be "imaginative as any other boys of
his age. There was no criticism of his morals, character or
veracity.

Our group reactions to this individual were, of course,
not always in agreement. We conducted a series of individual
interviews with him and brought him before our assembled group
so that each member could question him. He demonstrated consis-
continuation of his experiences and a willingness to have his
account investigated and he repeatedly agreed to stand questio
before a court of law.

Mrs. ------ explained to us that ------ was very upse
the night ------ claims to have had the experience and continuse
to be upset for several days. We recorded his accoun, studie
the results, conducted more interviews with him including
a field trip to the landing site. It was the thought of our
group that by spacing our interviews and pointing out discre-
in his account, he would have an opportunity to back down or
that he was lying. In fact, before our entire group. He asked
him to please tell us then whether or not he wanted to take
back any part of the story or all of it. He stated again that
he was telling the truth!

In reconstructing thevinicident we can say this about the
area: the road is narrow and steep at the particular point whe
stopped his car. A driver would find it necessary to be
wide awake and alert to avoid an accident. We submit that to re
stimuli of unusual nature would be absolutely necessary to make
a reasonable person stop his auto at this point on the highway
------ walked through a very rough field some 450 feet. And such
hike should have readied his mind to clarify what he saw. This
individual was experiencing fear and apprehension when he 
recognized what the object was and he tried to run away being
apparently frozen by a force ejected from the craft or by frinz
or both. But in any event, a concrete experience of fear overc
him. For these and other reasons, we feel that any answers
including delusions or illusions are completely out of order!

It is reasonable to conjecture that this fear of his might
have distorted his ability to observe: all of the detail concern
the craft, the man and the conversation, outstanding in Dave's
mind is the green light he encountered. Faulty in his memory
is the detail of the occupant's suit, whether or not he saw the
craft take off and exactly what took place during the second
encounter. But also prominent in his mind was the message he
told to convey, "The man made me understand that I was to take
the message to high authorities in Washington... that 'he' was
from another world....."

Please note that some words or parts were obscured, and I have indicated these sections with ------ where the text is not legible.

We are not the final judge in this matter. We bring the

account and it's message, in which we believe, to the high
authorities of this nation. Can you help us do it?

The image contains a sketch of what appears to be a classic flying saucer-type UFO. The UFO is depicted with a domed top and a flatter bottom, having a protruding section with a door slid open, where a kind of platform can be seen. The craft is drawn over a textured surface, which might suggest grass or ground, with trees or vegetation in the background. There is an estimate of size provided as "30' ESTIMATED." Additionally, there is some text written on the sides:

- On the top left, partially cut off by the image edge, it reads "MULBERRY CORNERS SCHOOL." On the top right, it says "ROTATING BEACON TREES LINE."
- On the right of the craft, there is a note that says, "THERE WAS A GREEN LIGHT FROM EDGE. I SAW A YELLOW LIGHT INSIDE."

Below the UFO, additional notes read:
- "TRACING MADE FROM
  ORIGINAL DRAWING
  HE QUOTES "
- "A DOOR SLID OPEN HAD SOME KIND
  OF A PLATFORM COME OUT."

This is a transcription of all the visible text included in the sketch.

The photograph depicts a classic "flying saucer" type UFO. It is an oval-shaped, smooth object with a distinct central dome on top. The object appears to emit or reflect a glow and is set against a dark background, giving the impression of being photographed in the night sky.

Here's the text from the document:

This drawing was one of many included in
an article which appeared in the December 5, 1955

The document contains three photographs. Each photograph is described below:

1. The photograph on the top left, labeled “ABOUT NORTHWEST”, appears to be a dark image showing a treeline or a line of shrubbery, with the terrain mostly obscured due to the darkness or quality of the image.

2. The photograph in the center of the page, labeled "FACING NORTHWEST ACROSS ROUTE 6", shows a hand-drawn diagram or sketch instead of a photograph. It appears to depict a road with trees, elevated ground, and marked locations labeled as high ground, low ground, and where trees are.

3. The photograph on the top right, labeled “EAST ALONG EAST”, features a wooded area with trees and underbrush. There's a car visible in the bottom right corner of the image with the driver's side door open.

was was shuttled between vs. and ██████████ and others after
10 years of his parents. He was legally adopted by ██████

b. Results of Interview:

(1) have seen the landings of the "saucer" talked to the person who
emerged from within it, and who gave him a message in Hebrew. “To
the effect (as told to this investigator) that, "I will visit
your leader, if there is another war--we will take over," ...” In communicating 
this event to his priests, _______ was advised to tell all stori-
directly to the proper authorities. This he has not done, and given
to his foster mother. However, the peculiar aspect of this case 
is, that he did give this information to Mr. ______ of St.Louis, a
number and self-styled official UFO investigator of the ______. 
Further investigation disclosed that although ________ side, living
considered an intelligent young man and possess odd attributes as
a God... Meanwhile, he is said to be a bit on the "side, living
in his own little world, and given to large imaginations: ______
further learned that on the same day that _______ claimed to have 
have seen his "flying saucer," a Cleveland firm was selling "toy
rockets as part of an advertising campaign, offering rewards to the
finders of these rockets. It was determined that ________ saw
these rockets and attempted to obtain one.

(2) ________ Sighting: On the evening of the same day (27 June) ______
_________. Willoughby, Ohio, to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. ______
__________. Mr. and Mrs. ______ willingly gave us their account
of the sighting they had made in late June or August of 1955. They
had no knowledge that the undersigned investigator had in his pos-
session a case dossier from the UFOBC. In brief, they both re-
peated to this investigator almost word for word their previous
report to the UFOBC. However, in the course of discussion follow-
ing their story the investigator learned that the UFOBC had pull-
up this particular case in their report to ATIC. The pictures sub-
mitted and as shown in the case dossier are not pictures of the
area of Mr. ________ home but of an area some distance away.
Also, some of the drawings as of the UFO sighted are erroneous accord-
ing to ________ who, apparently, reviewed it for the first time.
These were revised in the UFO dossier. It was learned during 
this interview that Mr. Roush of UFOBC is leading people to be-
lieve that he and the UFOBC organization are official USAF investi-
gators. They present some type of card for identification, believing
to be a USAF Reserve card or some sort.

In view of the fact that Mr. and Mrs. _______ repeated, almost the
exact story submitted in the UFO case dossier: and that Mr. ______
appears familiar with known types of aircraft: that he still
seemed frightened almost a year after his sighting, the undersigned
investigator was left with the impression that Mr. ______ was sin-
cere and truthful and that he did see something unusual and unworld-

(3) ________ Sighting: In the latter part of the day (23 June), an attempt was made to contact Mr. ______ who appears to be a sort
of "chairman" and self-designed chief UFO investigator of the
organization in question. Instead as Mr. _______ for the most part
personally prepared the UFO cases and information in this dossier
it was important that some background illustration on the indi-
vidual be obtained. It was determined that he did not and had
not lived in the address given to ATIC. The address was ob-
tained from his previous landlord. However, an insurance

salesman, was out of town. Discussions witXXXXXX wife, who also
observed the sighting with her husband, produced no interesting
information on this case. Mrs. XXXXXXX was of the opinion that,
although not positive, the object she observed was an aircraft.
Further, she gave this investigator the impression that her husband
got interested in UFO's merely as a hobby, but that his interest
"now has grown out of hand."

7. In accordance with a pre-arranged plan for conducting this series of inter-
views, the final interview was had with XXXXXXXXXX, the organizer and
director of the UFROC. He, Mr. XXXXXXX and Mr. XXXXXXX conducted the investigations on
these sightings, and somehow XXXXXXX ran off the 300 people who made this sightings on
this same date (22 October 1955). From all these witnesses accounts XXXXXXXX, I am
is lead to believe that all these sightings were of some type of aircraft. Significant
support is lent this statement because of numerous and constant aircraft flights in
and around Cleveland, from both private and municipal airfields. Within USAF units
located in the Cleveland Municipal Airport there are many numerous types of craft
flying out of the Cleveland area, i.e., advertising blimps, helicopters, transport
jet types to name only a few.

8. At the conclusion of interviews, this investigator emphasized to all inter-
viewed that the classification of so-me UFO cases and reports from private citizens,
and organizations is appreciated by the Air Force, ATIC and other delegated USAF
are the only "official" UFO agencies. It was strongly recommended that all sighting
should be made to ATIC or the nearest AF base immediately, and that if the sighting
were found to pose important action to initiate official USAF investigation
through the 4602d AISS and other pertinent units, who have trained investigators to
handle these cases, would be taken.

C. CONCLUSIONS:

9. XXXXXXX Case: Mr. XXXXXXXX an impressionable young man with an ove-
active imagination did observe some natural or explainable phenomena, but his own
imagination run riot to build up a story or a "flying saucer" landing and let out
pants talking to him to such an extent that he now believes or alleges to believe
this fantastic story himself. Considered an "eccentric" or "psychological manifes-
tation" UFO report.

10. XXXXXX Case: This was the only case of the four that did not disclose or
discrepancies between the original and present UFO report. No film or definite con-
clusion can be made due to lack of further information and the difficulty of getting
additional facts from the sources due to the length of time elapsing from the first
report. Considered an "unknown."

11. XXXXXXX Case: From his obvious susceptibility to suggestion, and descripti-
on of his sighting "500 feet from the ground - a light beam appearing shining toward
the ground," the object is considered an "aircraft" preparatory to landing, and will
be placed in that category.

12. XXXXXXX Case: Apparently an aircraft, but insufficient information.

13. General: All the individuals associated with the UFROC appeared to be
people who, although good American citizens, have vivid imaginations and sincere
beliefs they are helping the UFO program by conducting their own investigations and
analyses. It is further concluded that in all future reports from this organiza-
tion.

Memorandum for Mr. -----------

SUBJECT: Brief on UFO Research Council and Courses of Action

1. On 3 February 1956, Mr. Roush, UFO Research Council, located in Cleveland, was granted a conference in ATIC, with Capt. Hardin, Dr. Robinson and Mr. Wilson. This conference was the result of a letter (attached) sent to President Eisenhower, which through channels (Sherman Adams, Gen. Kelly etc. at the USAF Legislative Liaison Office, etc.) was approved by Col Eriksen on 30 January (letter attached).

2. A number of cases in dossier form, were submitted to ATIC by this organization, and it appears, a promise was exacted from Capt Hardin that the cases would be studied or explained, and a reply as to the results would be given to this group.

3. This matter was brought to the undersigned's attention recently by a letter from Mr. Moulder dated 6 June 1956, reiterating this promise (letter attached). A check with Dr. Robinson indicates that a promise was made. 

4. To the best of the undersigned's knowledge, it was determined that no action of any kind has been taken on this matter.

5. Dr. Hynek stated a few weeks ago (prior to receipt of Mr. --------------- letter) that this organization was one of the most active; that he had personally met its members and being a dedicated group, would normally press matters to a conclusion, if necessary.

6. For your information and background, and to save you the trouble of reviewing the large mass of data of each case, the following is a brief summary of the 'top cases submitted to ATIC by the council in February of this year.

a. -------- case,
Sighting: 22 October 1955
Cleveland, Ohio area over 105th St.
Object: Circular, bright orange glow, 500 feet off the ground. A bright, orange light was observed shining from the bottom of the object towards the earth.

b. -------- case,
Sighting: 22 October 1955
4711 Ardendale Road
South Euclid, Ohio
7:15 p.m.
Object: Large. Wide as average house. Made gruff course noise. Somewhat spherical in shape. Row of yellow lights.
Tree-top height.

6:45 p.m.

d. Case:

Sighting: 29 August 1955
Two miles west of intersection of Route 6 and 305.
Between 1:30 to 2:00 a.m.
Object: Typically "flying saucer" in shape. Fifty feet across.
Dome on top. A bolt of green light struck the ground in
front of men, and as men started to run. Objects landed,
door slid open, and a man came out. He informed Amer-
icandt, In English, "they" were from another planet.

7. In view of the possibility that these people may, again, contact the
President's office with a request for a follow-up or explanation, unless we can
give them some suitable reply (which we can later back up by official paper work),
it is the opinion of the undersigned that, regardless of the merits of each in-
dividual case, some action should be initiated, if for no other reason than for
our records to indicate something was done in this matter.

8. Two courses of action are contemplated:

a. A reply to the UFO Council that no firm conclusion can be reached
because of the insufficiency of information submitted.

b. Request a brief, informal investigation by the 4602nd AISS, in ac-
cordance with AFR 200-2. A reply to the UFO Council would then be that "investi-
gative action has been initiated; results unknown as of this date."

9. The latter recommendation above is considered the best approach. Any
reply to the effect "insufficient information" "no firm conclusion" "is still
under study" may only produce a large mass of additional data frm this organiza-
tion which undoubtedly will further confuse the cases on hand.

10. Your comments and/or recommendations with respect to this matter would
be appreciated.

Chief, Aerial Phenomena Group
