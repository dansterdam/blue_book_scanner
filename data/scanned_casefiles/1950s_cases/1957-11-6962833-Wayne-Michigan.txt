INTELLIGENCE REPORT

1. This report is submitted to inform you of an incident that occured on 6 November 1957 in Wayne, Michigan, involving the recovery of a strange metallic object.

2. At approximately 1800 hours, local police were notified of the discovery of a peculiar object in a residential area. Upon investigation, police found a large, irregularly-shaped metallic object which appeared to have fallen from the sky and crashed through the roof of a detached garage.

3. The object was approximately 3 feet in diameter and 8 inches thick. It was composed of a silver-colored metal with a rough, crystalline surface texture. No identifying marks or symbols were visible on the object.

4. Local authorities immediately contacted the U.S. Air Force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who dispatched teams to the scene to investigate. The object was carefully removed from the garage and transported to a secure military facility for further analysis.

5. Efforts are underway to determine the origin and composition of the recovered object. No further details are available at this time, as the investigation is ongoing. Additional updates will be provided as information becomes available.
