SUMMARY: (Show summary of report. Give significant facts in final one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures in order left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112—Part I(s)

1. At approximately 1330 hours, 29 May 1952, two objects described as disc shaped and light metallic in color, leaving no vapor trail and creating no sound, cut a small circle in a group of seven known observers. The observation point was the northern portion of Edwards Air Force Base.

2. While one of the men reported the objects as conventional aircraft, his statement revealed a difference of fifty-five degrees in the angle of observation.

3. The report is evaluated as reliable due to the aeronautical experience and education of the observers.

REPORT NO.

PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with AFL 200-5, paragraph 7 and a:

a. Two objects, appearing to be circular or disc-shaped, silver or metallic in color, with no ground or vapor trails, flew in a curved course from east to north to northwest. One object was flying behind and to the right of the other, at an estimated speed of from 200 to 450 mph. Objects were close formation before disappearing from sight, and increased speed very rapidly. No sign of wing or tail surfaces were observed by four of five witnesses.

b. The time of sighting was estimated to be between 1530 and 1400 hours, Pacific Standard Time, on Thursday, 29 May.

c. Objects were observed from the surface, with the naked eye.

d. The observation point was the northern part of Edwards Air Force Base at longitude 117° 53' west, latitude 34° 54' north. Objects appeared from easterly direction and followed a curved course to the north and disappeared in the southwest, after accelerating rapidly. No estimate of altitude was given.

e. Sighters were: Mechanical engineer with aeronautical background; test mechanic, with commercial flying experience with the Air Force and commercial companies; instrumentation engineer;

All of the observers are employed in the Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology at Edwards Air Force Base.

f. Weather conditions were excellent on the day of sighting, with visibility of 20 miles, and wind, west by southwest, 15 to 13 mph.

g. There were no known conditions, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

h. There is no physical evidence of the sighting, such as fragments, or photographs.

i. No known interception or identification action was taken.

j. A low-flying helicopter was seen at a low altitude before the sighting, and two F-86's were observed at about the same altitude as the disc-shaped objects, a minute or two after the objects and disappeared.

2. An electrical message was not forwarded due to the late date that this incident was reported to Air Force officials. Two of the seven known observers could not be contacted for statements.
