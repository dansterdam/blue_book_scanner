NEW EVIDENCE ON IGY PHOTOS

On the 16th of January, 1958, Mr. Admiral Barana, civilian and guest of the Brazilian Navy, on board the Brazilian Training Ship, Almirante Saldanha, photographed an object which flew in from the ocean, circled above the ship, and then flew out to sea. He obtained 4 photos. Barana was not the only observer, and various Brazilian newspapers at the time stated that "elements" (members) of the crew of the Almirante Saldanha had also seen the Saturn-shaped object. 
The incident was investigated, and even produced sight ings which preceded the event of the 16th. He mentioned in the test of his letter to APRO (dated March and May 1960) the existence of a secret Navy Report which dealt with the incident.
In October, 1954, a heavy manila envelope arrived at APRO Headquarters. It contained a complete set (4) of photographs of the "Trindade object" as well as correspondence between various Brazilian Navy officers concerning the incident and the photographs and letters and the Navy report itself, was a letter to Mrs. Lorenzen from the Brazilian Navy Intelligence Officer. In the letter he asked Mrs. Lorenzen to use the report, photographs and other material in any way possible in order to clear up the confusion and misrepresentations concerning the IGY photographs. He said he had read her book and complimented her on her handling of the IGY case. He also asked her to do everything possible to protect his identity, and this has been accomplished. Another request was that a copy be made by APRO of the contents and sent to that organization, for a set of the photos were being sent to that organization. (Always wary of such things, Mrs. Lorenzen checked APRO's files for authentic confirmation of the reports, and she found them to be authentic. She also contacted Dick Hall of NICAP and asked for IGY Evidence, page 3)

The image contains four photographs that were taken on January 16, 1958 by photographer Almiro Barauna on the island of Trindade, near Brazil. The photographs show an unidentified object in the sky over the island. The text describes the content of each photograph:

Photo 1, top left, shows the object approaching the island. 
Photo 2, middle page, left, shows the object at the time it was behind the island.
Photo 3, middle page, right, shows the object shortly after it made a turn.
Photo 4, bottom right, shows the object flying at high speed as it leaves the vicinity of the island.

The text states that this series is without doubt the most detailed, informative group of UAO pictures ever taken. The reader is informed that the editor and associates of the magazine are indebted to Dr. Fontes and Joos Martin for their efforts on our behalf, as well as to the editor of the magazine or Crusade, for permitting reproduction of the pictures in bringing attention to the field of UAO research.

INTERNAL COMMUNICATION-
CONFIDENTIAL
No. 0039 (M-20)
Subject: Trindade Island Oceanographic Post.
1. I am reporting to Your Excellency the information and conclusions obtained by the Intelligence Service, with respect to the phenomena observed several times in the Trindade Island.
2. It is my opinion that the facts make necessary a very careful investigation, so I suggest that Your Excellency follows the following procedures:
a) To order an exhaustive investigation over the island (it would be better if this task were entrusted to one or more officials of any UAO);
b) To order the installation of vigilance and registration staff on the island, to permit the observation in all directions of any abnormal phenomenon.
c) To recommend to the garrison to receive all visitors (UAOS) and register anything being sighted in connection with the subject, making every effort to obtain photographs.
d) To determine that, when UAOS are sighted, the following instruments will be used for observation and registration: cameras, binoculars, radar, magnetic needles, electric lights, internal combustion engines.
e) To establish a system of communication to the Navy High Command for the results obtained, and measures taken by the High Command.

1. I bring to your knowledge that the Chief of the Navy High Command has received over the radio a communication No. 605 of 14/2/1958, from the Chief of the Navy High Command to the Commander of the Trindade Island Oceanographic Post, on the same subject.
2. The information referred to was taken personally at this time by the Corvette-Captain Carlos Alberto Ferreira Boscoli, who was the Commanding Officer of the Oceanographic Post at the time when the phenomena was observed.
3. The report states that there is a number of witnesses, who they have sighted unknown objects, sometimes over and sometimes on the Trindade Island.
4. The report also presents the lack of technical resources (as mentioned in your communication) which were presented as insufficient, mostly due to the lack of technical skill of many observers and to the brief duration of the phenomena observed to that no conclusion can be reached about the UAOs.
5) That the most important and valuable evidence presented, the photographs published in the newspapers, proved to be impossible to observe the previous phenomena.
6) That the emotional reaction of the observers who have reported the sighting of UAOs is very strong and easily noticed.
7) Taking these conclusions admitted by this High Command into consideration, I would like to recommend to Your Excellency to determine to the Commander of the Trindade Island Oceanographic Post, to better observe the garrison started in that island, making every effort to obtain, by any means, photographs and more data that can serve as evidence of the existence of unidentified aerial objects.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

IGY Evidence . . .
(continued from page 5)
Photographs and Statement Department.
J. Battle, the CC Baccallar brought to
the attention of Mr. Morrow, who had
taken the photographs, the professional
photographer Alvin O. Macklin, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, to whom he made
the following report:

"I was on the deck of the "NE Almerants (Sidarta)" when I was called
to look at a strange object which was observed in the sky about 5:45 p.m.
at a distance of 5-10 miles. After a few
moments of observation:

It - Immediately after sighting it, he
started taking six successive photographs;
He - Thereafter, as he had shot the
last photo on the film, he took out the
film from the camera and remained for
waiting the passing of a strong emotional
disturbance he was feeling, due he went
through the process of shooting the last
film, already escorted by the CC Baccallar.
IV - He remained in the darkroom for
about 10 minutes, accompanied by the
AS Carpen, who was helping him then
to develop the last photos taken by the
Baccallar, with the impression that the
object photographed had also appeared
on the film. However, the photographic
impression was changed by CC Baccallar
himself showed him that in the photograph some kind of "Vortex" shapes were
visible, in different positions, as a image
looking like the others.

VI - He kept the negatives and brought
them to the where, in his inability to
observe them better, he pasted well only in two pictures because the other negatives were very dark.
VII - He made an operation known as
"clearing," which consists in exposing immediately the whole negative, however, as in
this picture the shape appeared with
them in the process failed, he cut the film
and submitted to the process mentioned
and the shape appeared with great clarity in two of them, in different positions.
VIII - He said that, seeing the UAO at
the distance, it gave the impression of a
plate surrounded by a kind of luminous
halo, showing great mobility at high speed, and
while a dark circular silhouette to define its
outline, the same was illuminated from within
by a sudden and be compared to soap foam;
It seemed to leave a small central of the
that it a sound heard like a discharge,
sound,
II - He got so nervous and upset at

SHAPE- The classical disc and a tearddhaped object. One object, (seem from
below) according to the observer, was
screened over the Island on 12.8.57. The
other seemed of a different shape, at a
gistant point: it was of an obscured
shape, (Saturn-shaped?).
COLOR - Indecisive for some, like
luminous, red - orange, slightly illuminated. Another similar like a kind of metallic
SOUND - All observers said the objects
were noiseless.
SPEED - Some observers noticed the
discharge, shaped like a white trail; others
noticed nothing of the kind;
SIZE - All observers agreed that the
objects were varying in wide shape, from
some were able to make size estimates.
MOBILITY - All the reports called attention to the extreme mobility of the
objects, performing unusual maneuvers,
like those of an airplane, but more
rapid and abrupt, with sudden changes
of course and speed.
ALTITUDE AND DISTANCE - Only
the observers of the first sighting on
12.8.57, when the UAO was seen passing over the
Island, estimated a height, compared
to the height of the peak it passed over,
i.e. about three times the height, or
about 1500 meters.
MANEUVERS - All the reports agreed
on the fact that the objects performed
unusual maneuvers.
APPEARANCE - That of a solid body
in all cases.
PHOTOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS-Very
short, estimated at ways in seconds.
a) That the observers who took the
UAOs know perfectly how to identify aircraft; and plane, even tiny in the island
was properly identified in all communications being reported to the
meteorology and Navigation Department.
b) That - considering the circumstances in which the photos were taken, focused
by immediate developing of the films, the
coincidence of the emotional state of the
observer - everything indicates that no
photographic process was done at the locale.
NEGATIVE POINTS
I - No points of the film were made at
the locale of the sighting.
IT - The ship's Commander didn't take
possession of the negatives, after development.
III - The making of the prints and enlargements was done by the photographer in
his own photo.

ter the sighting that he found it difficult
to proceed with the developing the film.

ANALYSIS - An analysis of the facts listed
in the previous item shows:
a) That the five UAO sightings occurred four
were made at daylight and one at night,
b) That in two UAO observations the
multiple sightings were made, which made
only, which is explained away as a
coincidence.
c) That the witnesses who sighted the
UAOs were persons with different qualifications - workers, medical officers, civilians, mechanics, professional photographers, Navy personnel and other crew
members.
d) That an observation from the Navy
Corps sighted the phenomena registered.
with the exception of the UAOs contents
being photographic.
e) That in all incidents it was noticed
a ways known about the difficulties in
obtaining clear photographic images of the
phenomena, on the other hand a man
professional photographer There was
even a case where, a man personal photographer, very skeptical, who got them
frightened.
f) That the reports, despite the great
difficulty in obtaining good information
from people with little culture around
the site of the sightings, present the
following data:

Text from the document:

IGY EVIDENCE...
(Continuing from pages 6)
POSITIVE POINTS:
1. The report of the CC Bacellor, who saw in the film immediately after it was developed, said that the picture appears to be a moving object identified as a saucer, and also that the pictures preceding the sequence were taken aboard a few minutes before the incident...
2. Concerning the negatives, they were submitted to examination by the Hydrography and Navigation Department from the Crueiro do Sul Aerophotogrammetric Service, with the following results:
a) The technician from the Navy's HPD, after examination of the negatives, affirms that they are natural;
b) The technician from the Crueiro do Sul Aerophotographic Service, after microscopic examinations to verify the granulation, analysis of signals, verification of impurities and details of outlines, affirmed that there was not any sign of photomontage in the negatives so all the evidence indicating they are in fact negatives of an object really photographed;
c) The hypothesis of a photomontage can definitely be excluded. 
d) It is impossible to prove either the existence or the nonexistence of a previous photomontage, which requires however a high-precision technic and favourable circumstances to its execution.
CONCLUSIONS:
Considering the presentation of the facts and the summary analysis made, it can be concluded:
a) That there are a number of witnesses who stated they have sighted UAOs over the Trindade Island. Such witnesses have different qualifications and their statements were made in different days;
b) That most reports presented are insufficient, mostly due to the lack of technical skill of many observers and to the brief duration of the phenomena observed, so that no conclusion can be reached concerning positive data about the UAOs;

Discussion
This first item in this roll of film. Barinna had been afraid
discussion must of necessity be briefer than the brief incident which gave rise to it. Captain Baranna
and his friends Jose a' Espinoza, etc. he explained were in the group photographed aboard the
"Tchabaldo (Vice Admiral of the Zone-Arichar region) and Aomar Vieira Filho, certainly understandable
osition of the
at the time of this unfortuante hunting incident."
Tereading the statements of these men, we find that some of the exposures were
merely that condition (See AEC p. VI.)
The two persons who made the photograph were individuals who could either be a combination of two persons
or represent a single photographed group. However, as the bulletin has pointed out before,
art are not consistent, and it is felt that this was so merely to mistakes in copying.
by the men who forwarded them to the Air Force. In a conclusion, we must call attention
to the fact that no positive identification of the object could be made.
The photograph labeled No. 2, is mentioned, in the article as most im-
portant for it summaryzes what Captain Casave gave Captain Brasilia. However the
FACTS which he prepared to be sent to the AEC are not included in the analysis.
Chief of the Navy High Command. Adairal Alvez Camera on 25 February
1958 wrote Admiral Alves Camera. the U.S. Naval Attache has this photograph and
decided to send information on to the Navy Minister.
Let us further emphasize a few other points: Barinna went into that observation
body. No place to conceal extra film or
paraphernalia with which to add to make
a composite etc. He was there only
photographing what occurred before his
camera. Civilians (Mr. Granda Vieira and
Senhor Baranna) witnessed everything.

There possibly will be criticism of the foregoing stated documents, whereas the document states its own opinion. But if the criticism if it comes, it will probably be a result of resentment for a USAF having backed the AEC when they
real documents, in a related effort to de-emphasize the authenticity of the "Trindade case.

Alista, the first man to sight the object, had called it "a big sea urchin". No officer or crewman of the Brazilian Navy reported seeing the UFO, in addition to the photographer, only two persons saw the UFO - the two friends of the photographer, neither of whom had any connection with the Brazilian Navy. The reporter had ample time and many opportunities to take the pictures. A series of double exposures was taken against a dark background could be recalled and the trick.
The final paragraph from a United States Intelligence report provides a comment on the affair: "It is the reporter's private opinion that a flying saucer piloted by very friendly Martians has been spotted, since everyone know that Martians are extremely comforting creatures."

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 54—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS 
The prints used in O Cruzeiro have obviously been cropped since, while the thin frames, they are not square. Frame 1 shows the UFO while at some distance from the island. Frame 2 shows the UFO above, as if at the right of a peak. Frame 3 shows it at the light of a lower altitude. Frames 4 and 5, never properly reproduced, did not show the object, and in Frame 6 the UFO is a mere speck low on the horizon. 
Frame 3, the only one showing the "Saturn-like" shape, deserves special attention. In the published print the mountains in the fore-ground are quite clear, while the UFO is little more than a dark line with an indistinct beginning and end, with a faint suggestion of rounding at top and bottom, without the dark line the curves would disappear so subtile, so completely does the object merge into the background of overcast sky. The picture widely distributed by news agencies is a further enlargement of the section containing the UFO. In this enlargement the foreground looks dark, the UFO a distinct black blur, but the UFO has gained greatly in clarity. The central band is darker, particularly at the left, and the outlines of the object are no longer vague. 
The Navy's study of the negatives revealed several delicate features. The details of the land in the foreground were very sharp, but the UFO disk was hazy, showed little contrast, and was essentially without shadows. The object in Frame 4 seemed to have been inverted with Frames 1 and 3. From the reported high velocity of the saucer and the fast shutter speed, some lateral blurring might have been expected, but no such blurring appeared. Besides, the dimensions as photographed preclude the possibility that they were fraudulent—cannot be known. Experienced photographers can easily think of a dozen possible devices. The probability that they were faked is overwhelming and, but for the embarrassing fact that the Brazilian President had seemed to sponsor them publicly, the Naval Ministry would undoubtedly have exposed the entire hoax. 
In summary, the facts are these: The man who made the Trinidad pictures had no connection with the Brazilian Nav—he was a pro-fessional photographer.

The image contains a photograph of a document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be an old UFO report. The document discusses the Trindade affair, where witnesses observed a UFO and took photographs of it. The text mentions that the photographs were not able to capture much detail due to the speed and distance of the object, but it provides a description of what the witnesses observed. The text also discusses the Rolleiflex camera frame size and the fact that the photographs show the UFO measured about 3.25 inches on the frame.

early that month I saw Chapter 16, and seems to It was several weeks later, in the month of the sauceyr engagement, ho was no longer certain just what he had seen. First, he said to make it very clear that I don't know if what I saw was really a saucer. "What I saw was definitely some sort of flying object, and I'm quite certain that it wasn't any conventional aircraft," he said. He added that it was a large, silvery object which moved with tremendous speed and suddenly disappeared in the horizon. It did not possess any protrusions or wings, and emitted no noise. After making observations for a few seconds, it was gone, disappearing very rapidly towardsc the horizon line. Everything happened in a matter of less than twenty seconds, and for this reason I gave you more details about the curious craft. It looked like an object with a polished surface and uniform color. I am sure it was not a balloon, an airplane, or a sea gull." This description does not mention the dark band around the object or the "Saturn-like" appearance noted. It sounds remarkably like a description of the typical or standard flying saucer.
When asked whether the object he saw was the same as that on Baumanns film, he said before, "As I said before, the thing was too rapid. 
It was almost impossible for the human vision to fix any detail of the object. Mr. Baumann, however, was operating with a camera of modern type which was able to register these details. Generally speaking the shape of the object sighted was the same seen on the negatives. . . " [24]

The Trindade Photographs
Accounts of the Trindade affair often remark that the photographs must be genuine because no opportunity for fraud occurred. On the contrary, there were ample and repeated opportunities. Since Baumann was not under observation when he loaded his camera, he could easily have inserted a "prepared" film, with no one the wiser. With the type of camera used, the operation would have been simple. He was again free from observation when he developed the negatives. Captains Bacellar recorded him to the door of the darkroom but remained outside, on guard at the door. The only person to accompany Baumann inside to help by holding a flashlight was his friend Viegas--the same man who had cried "Flying saucer!"
When Baumann emerged with the developed film, he exclaimed "Look, comrades, we have observed the UFO." The witnesses allegedly agreed, however, that the negatives showed the object they had seen in the sky--an amazing fact when we remember that the Rolleiflex film frame is small, only about 2.25 inches square.
In the print of Frame 3 shown in 0 Case-file, the UFO measures approx 3.25 inches.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document titled "FINAL GALLEY PROOF" discussing the "THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS" and providing details about a submarine hunting club, a photographer named Almiro Barauna, and an incident involving a flying saucer sighting on Trinidade Island.

Here is the text from the document:

FINAL GALLEY PROOF 

Galley 80—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

The Icarus Submarine Hunting Club

The accounts originally printed in the Brazilian papers and in O Cruzeiro contain a number of significant details that have been glossed over or ignored by UFO enthusiasts, both in Brazil and in the United States [...]who accept the Trinidade Island news stories, frequently gathered by intelligence officers, and of the photographs themselves as leads incescapably to the conclusion that the Trinidade Island sighting was a hoax.

Almiro Barauna was a free-lance photographer. A professional of unusual skill, he had long been interested in flying saucers and, some time before the Trinidade incident, he had published a purportedly humorous magazine article entitled "A Flying Saucer Hunted Me at Home" and illustrated by admittedly faked photographs. He had also published trick photographs of "treasure chests" lying on the ocean bottom. In addition, Barauna spoke of an underwater photography and was a member of the Icarus Submarine Hunting Club, a group given to diving and the study of life on the ocean floor.

When the Almirante Saldanha left Rio for its historic January visit to Trinidade Island, the ship had on board, as guests of the Navy, five members of the Icarus Submarine Hunting Club. Among the five, in addition to Barauna, were Agillar Vieira Filho, captain of the group, and Jose Teobaldo Viegas, a retired captain in the Brazilian Air Force [...]

On January 16 when the ship was getting ready to leave Trinidade, these three friends were on deck. Barauna, with his loaded Rolleiflex, immediately shouted: "Look, a flying saucer!" and Barauna snapped his pictures. No other eyewitnesses have been found, even though the deck was crowded with sailors. The ship's dentist has been listed as a witness (in one document he appears as two persons: under two different versions of his name) but no newspaper correspondent examined mentions his name. Captain Bacellar, returning from his post as commander of the Trinidade station, has also been listed as a witness but.

- page 14 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The text in the document discusses an alleged sighting of a flying saucer and the subsequent investigation and reaction from various government agencies.

Here is the text produced by the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system:

"Early that month (late chapter IB) and among all these things a report from Fairport Harbor, Ohio, was received here with utmost reserve. There will be an investigation to verify the authenticity of the sighting and photo-graphs, before long.

Immediately on informational level, we were told that these pictures were believed proof of extraterrestrial spaceships, or were they a hoax? Who were the witnesses, and exactly what did they report? In the United States, high officials asked for copies of the pictures, for Look magazine asked Dr. Menzel to fly to Brazil to examine the evidence, but later canceled the plan when the Rio office declared the pictures were generally considered fraudulent.

Public excitement in Brazil became so great that on February 25 the Navy Minlstry relegated an official statement, distinguished by its air of caution, which concluded:

"Clearly this Ministry will not be able to make any pronouncement concerning the reality of the object seen because the photographs do not constitute sufficient proof for this purpose."

and after the pictures were published, the Almirante Salduha which had been flying outside the harbor at Rio, received orders to proceed immediately to Santos, did never men have a chance to interview the officers and crew who allegedly had observed the strange saucer and could support Baiano's story. None of them, it turned out, had actually seen the object.

The assistant Naval Attache of the United States, who was then in Santos in connection with the visit of the U.S. Coast Guard officer, stated the Brazilian ship to collect information about the Trinidade affair, but with little success. The commanding officer had shown him the alleged UFO he had seen, but refused to express an opinion and stated that his secretary might have seen it from a better viewpoint.

While questioned, preferred not to discuss the matter. The officer said that he had not been on deck at the time of the sighting, but that other persons might have seen the object.

During the next week arguments for and against the authenticity of the Brazilian papers, and 0 Globo published, deliberately faked views of a "flying saucer" - a China plate blown through the air, in reply to the Naval Ministry's official note, displayed their amazing failure to promote even a statement from the officers and crewmen who were reported to have been the witnesses of the UFO.

In spite of the widespread and increasing skepticism, the weekly "Fato" used the Trinidade pictures for its lead story in the issue of March 5. "Once bitten, twice shy" - the public did not supply to its request. Who seemed instead to adopt the principle, "In Dubio, pro reo"?"

Here is the text output from the OCR analysis:

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 73-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

Here and now comes who reexamined it allegedly agreed that it showed the same Saturn-like UFO that had flown over the island. After the return to Rio he made prints and enlargements and turned them over, together with the negatives, to the Brazilian Navy. The question of authenticity arose immediately. Called down to interview, Barauna made a four-hour interrogation concerning the pictures [sic]. During the questioning he was asked, "If you were going to make a flying saucer appear on a negative, how would you proceed?" He replied, as he later told a reporter, "Commonsense, I am an able photographer, specialized in trick photography, but I could not produce one that would withstand close and accurate examination." [22]

In spite of this modest disclaimer, some of the photographic evidence clearly suggested fraud, and a strong difference of opinion developed among government officials. Some accepted the pictures as a genuine record of a flying saucer; others pronounced them fakes. To some the incident took on the look of a hoax, since the Portuguese pilot, Commandante, which probably means a retired Navy officer, was allegedly the only person present on the scene to claim that pictures had been taken, and he also was the only one to come forward with them. The Brazilian Navy, further concealment because of technical delays and the refusal of its military advisers and newsmen, and against the advice of the Naval Ministry, he released the pictures to the press.

The Brazilian Naval Ministry

The photographs were published on February 21, five weeks after they were taken. Since the President had apparently accepted them at face value, the Naval Ministry was obviously in a difficult position; though it issued a statement notable for its brevity and ambiguity, the pictures were widely distributed.

On the morning of January 16, 1958, over the island of Trinindade, the crew of the school ship Almirante Saldanha sighted an unidentified aerial object for a few seconds. A civilian who was aboard the ship took some pictures of the object. The Navy has no connection with the case, and its only connection with the occurrence was the fact that the photographer was aboard the school ship, and came back with the ship to Rio. [23]

On the same day another Navy spokesman released a similar unofficial statement to O Globo:

- page 16 -

The image contains a photograph that appears to be a grainy black-and-white image of something in the sky. The text indicates that this photograph was taken by a photographer who was on a ship, and the image was meant to capture a UFO that was observed by the officers and crew.

Text from the document:

Early that month (see Chapter IX), and settlers at Itapu Fort, near Santos, on November 4 had reported a UFO that knocked out the lights and electric plant.) With a weather balloon going up daily, paraschuting floated down at odd times, and sea gulls cresting over the island, the advent of other "saucers" was inevitable. During November and December several UFOs were reported by workmen, none of whom were trained observers. Although neither Captain Bacellar, the commanding officer at the station, nor his officers saw any unidentified objects, he radioed Rio to report the incidents and investigated each story. Some he found to be false, some were based on mistakes identification of gulls and balloons, and in others the evidence was inconclusive.

Early in January 1958, when the Almirante Saldanha arrived on schedule at Trinidade, it had on board several civilian guests who were to collaborate in various aspects of the research. Among them was Alinio Barauna, a professional photographer. After several days at the island, the ship prepared to leave for the return trip to Rio on January 16. Shortly after noon Barauna was on deck with his camera, waiting to film the departure. The sea was rough, and waves dashing against the ship and the rocky shore created a noisy background.

According to the news accounts printed several weeks later, Captain Viegas, of the Brazilian Air Force, suddenly shouted "Olha o disco!" ["Look at the disc!"], and officers and crewmen on deck also observed the UFO, he said, and interfered with his aim as they ran about excitedly. Nevertheless he managed to take six shots of the UFO as it approached the island, disappeared behind a mountain peak, reversed direction and reappeared at a lower altitude, retraced its course, and vanished with incredible speed against the horizon. The unknown had arrived and departed in a period of about twenty seconds.

According to the news stories, the photographer had retired to the ship's darkroom under the supervision of an officer to develop the negative, and found that four of the six exposures showed the mysterious object. He was not able to make prints, he said, because the darkroom supplies unfortunately did not include any photographic paper. However, he did exhibit the negative and the developed film to Captain Viegas and other officers.

The image contains a photograph of a UFO, described as the "Trinidade Island Saucer". The text discusses how this photograph was one of the most famous purported UFO photographs, appearing in Brazilian newspapers in February 1958. The text goes on to provide detailed information about the sighting and the subsequent investigation, including the fact that the Brazilian government seemed to accept the photographs as genuine. No human faces are visible in the image.

The text of the document is as follows:

The Trinidade Island Saucer

The most famous of all purported photographs of a UFO, the so-called "Trinidade Island Saucer", was published in Brazilian newspapers on February 22, 1958. The pictures showed what appeared to be a flying saucer over the island of Trinidade, some 500 miles off the east coast of Brazil. 

According to the accompanying news stories, the UFO had flown over the island of Trinidade, and being photographed by a photographer on board, had been examined and supposedly pronounced genuine by navy experts before being released by the Brazilian Navy.

The affair which rocked the Brazilian Government and excited a world-wide science uproar, was merely an incident that came to light when a major world government thus seemed to accept the photographs as authentic. 

Although subject to some adverse criticism, careful study of the facts strongly suggests that this case, which rocked the Brazilian Government and excited a world-wide science uproar, was merely an incident.

At first glance, the circumstances of the sighting seemed to be impressive, that Trinidade Island is a barren, mountainous island of about six square miles, some 500 miles from the coast of Brazil. The island remained deserted except by a few men until October 1957, when the Brazilian Navy established an oceanographic post and a meteorological station there to carry out its research for the International Geophysical Year. Studies, the Navy also converted a training ship, the Almirante Saldanha, into a floating laboratory equipped with scientific instruments and photographic darkroom. With a crew of about 50, the ship routinely traveled between Rio de Janeiro and Trinidade Island.

The major function of the meteorological station was the launching of weather balloons, their wind velocities and directions being studied. This was carried out daily with small transmitters launched each opening. In addition, they were tracked by radio and optical devices to show the movements of the winds in the upper atmosphere. At a certain point (April 16, 1958) the balloons seemed to have a strange object appear and hover above them. Startled, the scientists on board released a bag of scientific instruments which, attached to a parachute, descended to be retrieved.

The Trinidade station began operation in November 1957. Almost immediately, UFO's were reported over the island. (Until this epidemic, the island had been virtually uninhabited).

SECOND ALASKA SIGHTING 
IN THREE WEEKS

On the 17th of February a "flame-colored" object, circular in shape, hurtled through Alaskan skies over Unalakleet and St. Michael about 150 miles apart. Sighting reports came to APRO Headquarters via the Associated Press from the Alaskan area shortly after the object was observed. In the general area of the object, a scant amount of physical description of the object was sent on the initial story.
As this sighting followed closely on the heels of the North American Air Defense Command established radar trackings of unidentified objects moving in space over Alaska early on the 15th, it seems likely that at least one object was seen on Saturday the 17th which triggered the initial story. 
The NORAD (CONAD) spokesman said that several unidentified objects were moving in space immediately after the first sighting, and some observers said that they saw an object which was sighted at Unalakleet also move in a southeasterly direction, disappearing from view. 

RAAF Statement on 
Gill Sightings
The following is the text of a letter from Squadron Leader Peter Norris of the RAAF to a correspondent dated 11th December 1954 in regard to the Gill Sightings (Appendix to Bulletin, Supplement No. 10): 
"An officer of this Headquarters has investigated the 'Gill sightings' of New Guinea, and copies of his findings have been submitted to the proper authorities. 
"The view held is that the objects sighted were a meteor. This conclusion is based on the fact that the objects were observed to approach and depart the horizon at a high rate of speed and in almost vertical ascent and descent, resembling in many ways the characteristics of the passage of a large meteor. 
"The fact that the objects were observed by a number of independent observers tends to confirm the supposition that an unusual phenomenon was involved. However, the fact that the objects were of indefinite shape and the difficulty in estimating their size and distance tends to lead to the conclusion that they were a large meteor rather than structured craft.
"The report concludes that while the sightings are not considered to be of extraterrestrial origin, they may be of considerable scientific interest and importance from the point of view of upper atmosphere research and the study of meteor phenomena."

Agencies in Disagreement 
On Mystery Lights
A series of lights seen over Texas in the past week, according to Air Force officials, were probably aircraft lights. Meanwhile, the National Space Agency said the lights were believed to be a satellite that fell back to earth and burned up in the atmosphere.
The lights were seen as far south as Key West, Florida, and as far north as Washington D.C. Air Force officials in Washington said the lights they believe were caused by aircraft were reported to the Defense Department.
The National Space Agency confirmed the fact that some kind of picture-taking satellite around the moon was expected to fall into the earth's atmosphere in March.

NICAP SCORES
NICAP made national headlines on 27 Dec. 1959 on the disclosure of an Air Force Inspector General's brief issued to all commands on 21 Dec. 1959. The brief dealt with "Unidentified flying objects - some sighted of extremely bright intensity at night and difficult to locate accurately identified as stars and planets during the daylight hours."

Authorities Grab Photos;
Hopf Urges Vigilance 
On Part of Membership

Two instances in which private individuals succeeded in obtaining photos of UFOs have come to the attention of the APRO staff.

On September 14, 1957, Mr. Ibrahim Sued, a social columnist for the Rio de Janeiro daily "O Globo", received a letter from a reader. The reader asked Mr. Ibrahim Sued, As a faithful reader of your column, and an admirer of your; wish to know your standpoint on the highest air phenomena, concerning the flying saucers. If you believe they are real, or just a fantasy. I could not neglect to inform you about them. But just a few days ago I had to change my mind, I was at a place near the town of Chabuta, Sao Paulo, where I saw a flying saucer in the air. At the same time other persons who were there also saw it. It speed, to an accidental movement, seemed tremendous. In other words, a seen in a very fast manner. At the last moment, however, when it must have planed to the ground, it made a turn rapidly into a fantastic maneuver, we all were surprised. When we aee the disc it was encircled by a flame as if in might; it disintegrated into thousands of fiery fragments, trailing a daintily brightness. The phenomenon, all thought identical to some kind of fireworks, in spite of the time of the day and the season was almost all, fell into the number of small pieces fell close to the beach and sea - picked up a large amount of paper I enclose herewith a small sample of it. I do not know what this may be. I never read about a flying saucer being composed of paper or anything similar to that. I would appreciate very much if you could inform me something about this unusual phenomenon. 

Mr. Sued, as editor, took to the letter to the office of the Brazilian Air Force, who sent two officers to investigate. The officers made a careful examination of the pieces of material found at the site, and made reports, and returned to the Air Force headquarters. So far, the Air Force has not released any official information about their findings.

In another case, Mr. Perry, a plaza restaurant owner and amateur astronomer, obtained some photographs of a UFO on November 24, 1959. According to the APRO photo analyst, John Hopf, the photos showed an object with a very bright light, and with a dome. Mr. Perry showed them to some customers and friends, and some individuals said, "It seems to be something unusual." The FBI confiscated the photographs, stating that they were interested in acquiring them for "processing and study."

A "specific officer" should be designated by the Air Force to handle UFO sightings and information. He must have the scientific background and also, if possible, a scientific technical background. Responsibility for handling UFO's rest with other intelligence agencies, and the order of preference should be: 1) local, 2) state, 3) county, 4) Air Force.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
APRO received a letter via telephone on April 10, from the Director of the Freedom Foundation of Valley Forge, George Washington Hill, in which he requested APRO to supply him with detailed comments pertaining to the Air Force's response to APRO's answer to their communication concerning Maj. Keyhoe's remarks to the Freedom Foundation. The Director asked for copies of APRO's reply, and the previous communication from the U.S. Air Force. This is in accordance with a request received from the U. S. Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee.

Takanashi to Study Ice Fall Data
Mr. Takanashi, a Japanese engineer, has requested the assistance of the United States staff to forward data concerning ice falls. He would like to have forwarded to him in Japan all the data the U. S. has on the subject of ice falls, their continuity, possibility of man-made origin, and the scientific phenomena involved. Mr. Takanashi is continuing research on the ice fall problem at the request of the Japanese government, and he is interested in exchanging information with the U.S. on the subject. APRO has agreed to forward to Mr. Takanashi with regular packets of related information.

Physical Evidence...
No. 15 6/1" dated September 24, 1957, Regis Pretious, Sao Paulo, Brazil:
This photo shows the unidentified object which he photographed. The object was round, saucer-shaped, and silvery in color. The altitude was approximately 600 meters, and the object was sighted for approximately 6 minutes.

The particles were dark gray, solid and amorphous in structure. They were about 1/16 of an inch in diameter, and are believed to have been produced from the object during its flight. Analysis showed that the particles were composed of compressed carbon which was apparently produced by the application of a fingerprint.

Dr. Fontes checked up on the photograph and found that it was bona fide. At first sight he might think that the stuff was debris, but he had had some experience with such material and recognized that it was unusual in weight, Fontes noted that the stuff was lighter than aluminum—almost as light as paper.

Dr. Fontes then told him that he had read the account, and would like to examine the material and sued insisted that he would be most grateful for the opportunity. Dr. Fontes would also like to know the results.

Before beginning the analysis procedure, Dr. Fontes weighed the possibility that the stuff could have been artificial, but concluded that this premise were true, the material would have pretty good properties of elasticity and could not have been as light as it was, and that it had never exhibited any interest in UFOs and who were under suspicion. Therefore, he accepted the sample as genuine and sent the stuff to the only man in the public eye that he could think of.

In his fully documented report, Fontes stated that although he would have sent the material to the U.S. for analysis, he hesitated to do so inasmuch as he had the staff in his hands, he decided to investigate the incident, but inasmuch as he had the staff in his hands, he decided to investigate the incident.

For the analysis which he knew would have to be substantiated, Dr. Fontes submitted a part of the sample to the Material Production Laboratory, a Mineral Production—a Brazilian government facility. Dr. Pretious, who had the object photographed, was at the time engaged in special work with radiation, but over to the U.S.A. for personal reasons. Fontes, who, after studying the material, said that the fragments of the Brazilian UFO were quite light in weight, almost as light as paper, and that the specific gravity of the substance, and that it was so light that the substance was metallized plastic, rather than the usual matter, i.e. the substance was metal. It was the first time Fontes decided on a spectographic analysis.

Official analysis of the sub-stance submitted by the Material Production Laboratory concluded that the substance was not a mineral of any kind, and that it was a plastic of some kind, exhibiting characteristics of being extremely hard, extremely light in weight, and the color was a dark grayish-black.

Fontes then decided to make a comparative spectrographic analysis to determine the composition of the material. He planned to request a second spectrographic analysis of the material, which was made by the Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory of the National Observatory in Rio de Janeiro, a highly respected scientific institution.

Edison Penna, a former chemist at the Brazilian Navy, performed the second analysis. He planned the analysis to determine concentration and precise identification of the elements, but found that a second analysis was unnecessary. He plannet the analysis to determine concentration and precise identification of the elements, but found that a second analysis was unnecessary.

The results of the first and second analyses agreed fully. The material was found to be an alloy consisting primarily of magnesium, with traces of other elements. The magnesium content was determined to be approximately 99.5%. It was concluded that the material bearing no resemblance to any ordinary alloy or plastic, must be a highly processed and refined material, "with impurities, if any, at a level only detectable by the most sophisticated analytical equipment." The report stated that the material was the "purest magnesium ever produced", and that it was extremely unlikely that it could have been artificially manufactured on Earth with the technology available at the time.

Editor's Note: The documented report, according to the information, shows that Dr. Fontes' examination and Dr. Barbosa's report on the X-Ray diffraction analysis film, conclusively proved that the material was an extremely pure form of magnesium, far exceeding the purity and characteristics of any known man-made magnesium alloy. The report concluded the tests which showed none of the impurities normally found in man-made products.

Don't Miss - the full story of APRO's attempt to get the facts about the latest evidence to the public, representatives, phone-tapping, and other "Expert" attempts to identify magnesium as something else proved.

Trindade Island Sighting
(Continued from page 3)
person near the object and, as a consequence, photographed the object and the island object - or rather, the objects near the island. There was an impression of direction from which it had come, and it appeared to slow in order to come to a halt near the island. This was the last photo (the last on the film). After about 15 seconds the object continued on over the island and gradually diminishing in size and finally disappeared into the horizon.

"The length of time the object was visible during the sighting?" Was the object emitting any sounds? A. I am not sure, to the best of my recollection, that it made any sound. No sounds were heard by the observers against the island, so, if any, I think that it would have been a slignt humming sound and at the time. However, I am not certain.

"If it showed a dark grey color, appearing to be metallic in the area, and as it got further away, it showed a greenish, phosphorescent vapor (or color) - did this object appear to be material?" A. Yes. It was obviously a solid object.

"How was it flying? Any Aerial characteristics?" A. Yes. It showed an undulating movement as it flew across the Island and when it came back, it changed speed drastica11y, with no transition, in a jump.

"After the sighting, what happened?" A. After the "Almirante Saldanha" sighted the object, A. The object was visible on the deck at that time, including Lieutenant Homero, Captain Vasco da Gama and myself.

"Now what happened after the sighting?" A. After the commanding and several officers of the ship questioned me as to what I had got in the photos. As I was very curious too, I decided to develop the films on board the ship. The processing was done under the supervision of several officers, including Captain Vasco da Gama. Negatives were seen aboard. The reasons there was no possibility of exposing the paper for the negatives, however, were seen and examined by the whole crew.

"Did you have any difficulties to obtain the photo negatives under any pressure to the Navy's authorities?" A. No. Com. Saldanha (A, name of the ship command) saw and the negatives and Captain Vasco da Gama was present during all this. They never tried to get the negatives from me.

"After this incident, the ship stopped first at Porto Alegre near Rio. A, The ship stopped first at Porto Alegre and then, I believe, went to Rio de Janeiro. From there I was going to stay there for some time. I was informed that the A. navy authorities were requested to appear there, but I do not know the results of this."

UAO SIGHTINGS OVER TRINDADE

By Dr. W. H. Teed, M.D.

THE "ALMIRANTE SALDANHA" INCIDENT:

In early January, 1958, while on a routine scientific study of the South Atlantic area off Rio de Janeiro's coast, a Brazilian naval ship, the "Almirante Saldanha", approached Trindade Island with a crew of forty officers, scientists and photographers. That ship had been previously converted into a hydrographic and oceanographic research vessel under the direct control of the Brazilian Navy's Hydrography and Navigation Division of the Brazilian Navy, and was making a study of the tides, currents and the geography of the island. Most of them connected with the Navy's oceanographic studies which were underway at the island. One passenger aboard was Dr. W. H. Teed, M.D., a medical officer in the Brazilian Navy Ministry. In the course of the studies, several UAO's were observed.

On January 16, 1958, at 12:23 p.m., the island station of the Naval Ministry received a message that a strange object had been sighted over the island and the ship had made several attempts to photograph it. According to the witnesses, a strange silvery object was sighted simultaneously by a number of observers, including the captain, officers, scientists and photographers aboard the ship. As the object approached the island at a high speed, hovered briefly over a peak, disappeared behind the island for a short time, and then appeared again over the water and disappeared, Mr. Barauna was able to take several photographs of it.

According to the witnesses, the UAO appeared as a bright metallic object with a revolving dome, approximately 12-15 meters in diameter. It approached the island at a high speed, hovered briefly, and then disappeared behind the island. When it reappeared it was travelling at a high speed and disappeared.

Several civilians were aboard the ship at the time, including the Navy's complement of scientists. Those scientists who were familiar with aerial photographic studies which were underway at the island, showed particular interest in the object. One scientist aboard, Mr. Almirante Saldanha, a Navy photographer, was able to take the first photo which was later confirmed and included in official Navy records. As a matter of interest, Saldanha was later a member of the Itamaraty Astronomical Commission, the Brazilian equivalent to our Smithsonian Institute, when the ship returned to Rio. I was unable to obtain further details at that time, as the ship immediately returned to Rio, our team a government employee at the base here had all other requests for further information.

"Barauna's Report"
Mr. Almirante Barauna who was the real photographer who took the photographs of the UAO, stated that the object was a metallic, brilliantly lighted one, approximately 12 to 15 meters in diameter and had a revolving cupola or dome. Barauna stated that when he first sighted the object, it was approaching the island at a tremendous speed from the sea. It then hovered briefly over the mountain top, and then dived behind the island. According to Barauna, the object was intelligently controlled. He described it as a definite machine, and stated that he was able to observe its performance, control and intelligently directed maneuvers. Barauna was very positive in his statements and stated that the object was definitely not a meteor, rocket, or any type of known aircraft. The Brazilian Navy fully confirmed Barauna's report and included the photographs in their official files.

Evaluation of the "Alvarez" photographs, which had not been reported released, said that these photographs in his interview, which is considered below:

There were four prints "mutilated" and the difficulty for a proper analysis from a photography standpoint was that all officers from the Navy General Staff stationed at the island, the person who is supposed to have taken these photos, and the others who may have touched the film, were warned not to discuss the matter. The Navy authorities refused to make any comments on the matter. An attempt by the press denied any knowledge of the matter. The Navy said that only Miramar naval base authorities were authorized to discuss the matter. Some Navy Departments even tried to deprive the Associated Press of interest.
The Intelligence officer said: "We want your negatives for further examinations. Do you still have the film? These things happened three days after the arrival of the "Almirante Saldanha" at the Navy's Intelligence Headquarters. A few days later the negatives arrived with a card informing me about the results of their study.
This time they also asked for my Rolltek. They should do that before, in order that I present them. Curiously, they not only asked for the films, as at the moment of the sightings. They asked the rest of the material.
I answered them that the saucer was not more than 500 Ft. /hour. One of the observers, who was beside me measuring it, said that the saucer was hovering over the "Desejado" Peak, stopped for four to five seconds, and that the saucer was not more than 500 Ft. /hour. They asked me about the size of the object, and I told them about 20-25 Ft. in diameter.
They asked me several other questions related to the observation. There came a suggestion that I should go to the United States, but I refused it alleging that I could not absent myself from my post.

EXCLUSIVE IGY PHOTO ANALYSIS

THE PHYSICAL EVIDENTIARY STORY

Editor's Note: The following is a chronicle based on an A.P.R.O. analysis of certain photographic fragments from Ottawa, CANADA, which came into our possession during the International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957-58. It is not our intent or purpose to belabor the accuracy of this analysis, but rather to contribute to the knowledge and understanding of those who are concerned and deeply interested in this most important aspect of our work associated with public relations and otherwise. As you will note, the relationship to its military service ties into the controversy surrounding an incident that allegedly occurred at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

We realize that it is unlikely that any positive action can be taken on the contents of this report, as the United States Air Force is insisting that you will forward it to the proper agencies. We feel however, that it concerns directly a recent report issued for your office to the effect that the Air Force has positively determined that any UFO's are real and extraterrestrial.

A release which you so issued early this month according to UPI states: "We have conducted exhaustive tests on fragments of a so-called flying saucer picked up in New Mexico. We have determined that they are authentic foreign fragments, and not fabricated. Their identification and origin are under study." This matter is of great concern to us.

We were requested to prepare a letter on the 13th, 15th and 16th of March, and after delay, the letter subsequently received by the Director, containing a signed parts of prior evidence as the answer which was dated the 13th of March and received on Thursday, 17 March.

DIRECTOR, Office of the Secretary, 17 March 1960.
Dear Mr. Secretary: This refers to your letter of March 13th on the subject of certain fragments reported to have been recovered from the atmosphere within the space-time framework of the International Geophysical Year (IGY).
The Air Force, through its intrinsic investigation capability, has determined that the United States Air Force has not been responsible for the withholding of this evidence from its own records. It has been suggested that this interest by the United States Air Force, through Headquarters United States Air Force (USAF), has been to pursue the matter to its conclusion, even though such exists. We do not have access to confidential information within the Air Force, nor do we wish to enter this controversy. Military and scientific authorities have been made available to the United States Air Force for their consideration.

The general appearance of the sky-water exposures were examined by the photographic authorities. Two of these (Nos. 4 and 5) did not show a normal sky. The third (No. 6) was of a normal sky with a contrail across it. The general appearances were rather dim and indistinct, and the identities could not be firmly established from the manner in which the photographs were taken. 

It is the comparison of the several fragments and the resultant analysis of same by those technically qualified within the respective government agencies consulted, which would allow the significance of these physical evidences to emerge. This comparison would necessitate access to all such material, which is not available to this office.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
Director

Physical Evidence ...
(Continued from page 2)
The contents of a letter dated 7 April 1960 
and which was answered by another letter dated 15 April I960, which read:
'Dear Mrs. Lorenzen:
This is to acknowledge your letter of 7 April 1960 concerning certain
regulations and procedures. I am enclosing a copy of this regulation.
You will note that Paragraph 29 therein
provides that unidentified flying objects and results of investigations,
regardless of origin, will be released to the public by the Director, Mrs. Lorenzen, as the
official APRO spokeswoman to the public with information on sightings and
evaluations. Sincerely, L. J. Tacker'
On the 15th of April, the following text
was a letter to the same date: 'Dear Mrs. Lorenzen:
This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of 7 April I960 with APR 203-3 enclosed.
You stated that the new regulation of 7 September 1959, differing from previous policies, are concerned. The differences are requiring that any additional information,
even that in possession of ATIC with the aim of submitting it to your headquarters for examination. This presumably means any persons or organizations that may have
factual data on an APRO or other case offered for examination. This requirement comes under Paragraph 39 and that direct communication with the ATIC can be prohibited in some instances.
I would have to view your copy of communications to
ATIC for this office with the current regulations to compare with what you request.
I am at this time unaware of any formal
communication from this office that would form a basis for your comments
on this matter with APR 203-3 Paragraph 39 -  the details of ATIC procedures.
However, I would probably suggest that you might want to be alerted on the morning of 25 March I960 and the conclusions of
their investigations up to that time - and ask you to address your inquiry
to Col. E. Lorenzen, Director. On the 30th your letter to us was shifted to ATIC. The following
is in the interest of correcting any misunderstanding which may have occurred:
'Dear Mrs. Lorenzen
On receipt of your letter of 7 April 1960, the contents were brought to the attention of Col. E.Lorenzen, Director. Our office has no restrictions as to the release of APRO information to the ATPC. Any additional information, even that in the possession of ATIC, can be made available through APRO headquarters for examination.
There has never been any intention on the part of ATIC to restrict communications to or from APRO or other private organizations. As the Director, Mrs. Lorenzen, you are specifically authorized under the referenced regulation to release to the public, information on UFO' sightings and results of investigations, regardless of origin.
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact this office.
Sincerely, L.J. Tacker'
AFR object a 'bulge motion'?
The Director, Mrs. Lorenzen, held a press conference on Holloman AFB, New Mexico, on the 9th of March to further the public interest in and understanding of the UFO problem. Some of the AFB's scientific personnel attended.
The Director, Mrs. Lorenzen, was asked several questions, one of which was: 'What is an APRO scientist?' She replied that APRO scientists are professional people,  not paid employees of APRO, who assist in the investigation of unidentified objects reported to APRO. They volunteer their time and the use of their specialized knowledge or facilities.
One AFB person asked: 'What is a "bulge motion?" ' The Director explained that this term is used to describe a type of motion sometimes observed in connection with UFO's. It refers to a swelling or bulging of the object, as if internal mechanism or something within the object is moving or operating. This was in reference to some of the physical evidence APRO has collected through its investigation.
The question was asked: 'How long has APRO been in existence?' The Director replied that APRO was founded in 1952 and is a non-profit, scientific organization devoted to the investigation of UFO's.
During the screening chain of events, the Holloman Home Telephone, which is a special line, was in constant use. Calls between the Director, Mrs. Lorenzen, and her staff of employees at Holloman were monitored. When the final physical evidence was sent out to the press on March 15th, an editor at Kansas City called and it was determined that the AP had released the story, without the APR Director's approval, on the 21st (probably checking with others concerned). The physical evidence was accepted well abroad, but in the U.S. serious questions have been raised as to its validity and it is not generally believed.
We have said that we would not release this material "Bink-stein" because people have been confronted with evidence that they can't accept, and then later are proved wrong. The "oneness" we have said in the past and will reiterate at this time--that some relationship to a higher Intelligence seems evident in many UFO
sightings--is still not accepted and
we know a certain type of confirmation seems to elude us. Perhaps we will never find it. In the meantime, on the 22nd of March, Mrs. Lorenzen was informed by a friend that her 20th (21st?) of March press release had been carried by wire services and many different newspapers as a sensation. Some sensational claims even had been added by editors.
Someone was obviously interested in APRO, because only a qualified officer or security screened person would be free to release such information about a security classified matter. The Director, Mrs. Lorenzen, wishes to make it clear that she has not authorized any release of information that a security clearance is issued.
Someones who is vitally interested in perpetuating doubt about the Director's
activities, because she is only a
qualified officer, may seize any
chance to discredit her. However,
we shall continue to try to bring about
proper scientific investigations, no
matter what obstacles are put in our
way. For several reasons.

continued from previous issue, was on the deck with his camera and, after the sightings, was unable to determine what the camera had recorded due to the nervous excitement. It is believed that he did not have the presence of mind to watch him closely.
(3)--The film was developed in a photographic laboratory several hours after the incident.
(4)--The Captain Bacellar, who was in the darkroom, holding a flashlight during the film's development, waited out the film's development.
(5)--I saw the film immediately after it was developed, still wet, and ami-examining the negatives in order to determine any characteristics of the object that appeared.
(6)--The characteristics of the pictures preceding the object passage corresponded with scenes taken aboard a few minutes before the incident.
(7)--That, in the pictures connected with the sighting, was visible, in different positions, an image looking like the object seen near the island.
(8)--I called Army Headquarters, announcing the immediate copies requested by the Defense Minister. They arrived three hours later. He came in a two American airplanes on February 28. He was the Genera Thomas Darcy, the U.S.A.F representative in the Brazilian Military Commission for Technical Assistance Negotiations.
(9)--General Thomas Darcy, after an interview with the press, at the Aero International Institute, visited me several times and discussed the reasons for his visit. The reasons are connected with several things. One of them is related with the "Trindade Sighting" and, as a defense military equipment for anti-submarine defense. On this trip I understand the Defense Minister, several officials, also authorized photographing the Trindade Island again.
(10)--The Newrpapermen then asked for his conclusion on the "Trindade sighting" to which the General gave the following answer:
"In the USAF we have a well-established viewpoint about flying saucers. We cannot share the contention that some of these UFOs can be a natural phenomena of atmospheric origin, because they still remain, and we cannot explain them. Military and scientific research must continue, and we will withhold our opinions on the matter so that a proper and definitive conclusion can be reached."
Major-General Thomas Darcy. Former Secretary of the General Staff of the USAF, Command, during World War II, has made several trips to Brazil in past years to look into various military problems with the Brazilian authorities.

Trindad's Sightings...

The "Gala Crest" maneuvered in several directions and disappeared into the horizon--come back just a few seconds later. I was told, as an air traffic control officer, I could not confirm or deny this report, but the real sensation had been in the office of the observer, where he had received some information. 

In the course of my personal investigation, I asked some friends about the high speed reports that had appeared in the press, but the reports existed, but had been rejected due to the observatory lack of equipment. At my request, they also rechecked the radar reports. These continued Barasana's report. According to the radar technicians, the ship could not be picked up on the radar, two days before Barasana's sighting, at about 6:30 P.M. Their direction had not been determined, and the strange body was not identified. However, as they were not sure that it was an airship or a reflection, the radar technicians admitted the possibility of a defect in the set, and it was normal.

Another bit of interesting information refers to the notes written in the newspaper DIARIO ESPANOL, on February 12, 1950. The staff members were going to tell you something about the island of Trinidad sightings that were reported in the papers. I cannot vouch for the source of this information, the sightings of the flying saucer itself. I do receive reports on the progress of the investigation, and the conclusions made from the analysis of the data via telemeters, and apparatus in scientific condition, associated operating organizations like the Air Force are looking into this, in proximity. The Navy decided to give this a "oneness fact."

Inside Navy circles, it was not possible to obtain any information of the facts, since they were connected with a confidential security measure, and were used to confirm or deny the information. All this results from the APRO files of sightings from Puerto Rico, showing that the Navy has failed to get further details concerning this data.

The Man Who Saw the Green Ray
"Trindade," with two p's, is the man who saw the green ray, Admiral Eutiques from the Navy general staff, told me that Commander Barauna was followed by a sailor who saw the objects maneuvering, and his report agreed with that of Commander Barauna, which was sent by telegraph to Rio de Janeiro. (it is believed that this sight was by a Navy ship).

Sailors were the witnesses. (Rio de Janeiro, February 9, 1958). I must confess that I was not impressed with the information so far known to me. Those who saw the first part of this story knew that it happened off Trindade island, and I had received information about a slight sighting involving a Navy ship on February 16. The incident of "Trindade" and the incident had occurred on January 16, which was near the coast of Trindade, I thought - however, just a few days later, I saw again the name "Trindade." This time it appeared in an official document, the House of Representatives (item 83) on February 27. This confirmed my impression. Now I was impressed. I rechecked my information but on the same sources, I couldn't find anything to indicate that the "Trindade" sighting had anything to do with the same sighting. I began to believe that the discrepancy might be due to a coincidence of names, for it was then that I was startled to some uncertainty, for the information I had received stated that the "Tridente" had sighted the objects near Trindade some days earlier than January 16, and the same source confirmed the same details on January 16, 1958. The same source had furnished additional data on the "Tridente" sighting. I couldn't find any records to substantiate other sightings on the Espirito Santo coast that day. The sighting had been witnessed by Dr. Aluir Barbosa, Director of the Maia Observatory, and Pedro E. Nunes, Director of the National Observatory.

Inside Navy circles, it was not possible to obtain any information of the facts, since they were connected with a confidential security measure, and were used to confirm or deny the information. All this results from the APRO files of sightings from Puerto Rico, showing that the Navy has failed to get further details concerning this data.

The Last Sightings on the Island of Trindade
After the happenings of January 16, 1958, the Naval Ministry decided to set up a permanent photographic project on the island of Trindade. This camera project included automatic cameras with telescopic lenses and a continuous 24-hour photographic record on the island. The last sightings on the island of Trindade were on the 4th and 5th of January, when another new UAO appearance, witnessed by the island inhabitants, was photographed. I don't know if we have the system worked up, but rumor has it that it performed that a U30 appeared over the Island on the 4th, in the daytime. One of the observers, a Navy doctor, tried to photograph it but the object vanished. On the 5th, at 3 p.m. it was sighted again on the northeastern horizon, it was described as a shiny, metallic object, flying very fast and at a tremendous height. The photographer at the station was still setting up his camera when the object disappeared from sight.

These sightings were widely publicized in the local press.

Text from the document:

Constellations Shine
By JAMES STOKLEY
a writer specializing in astronomy
With new constellations shining in the evening sky, this is a good time to become familiar with the night skies. Many of the stars and constellations that will be prominent in the months to come are now visible.
One of the most interesting stars to watch at this time is Sirius, the dog star, which is the brightest star in the sky. It is easy to find, low in the southeast. About 15 degrees above Sirius and to the right is Orion, the hunter, which is unmistakable with its three stars in a row forming the hunter's belt.
To the right of Orion is Taurus, the bull, with the bright star Aldebaran marking the bull's eye. Farther up and to the right are the Pleiades, sometimes called the seven sisters, a beautiful little cluster of stars.
Mercury Rises Early
On Jan. 15 Mercury, which is the closest planet to the sun, will be at its greatest eastern elongation. This means it will be farthest from the sun in the evening sky, and therefore easiest to see. The best time to look for it will probably be about 5:30 p.m. EST, just above the southwest horizon.
The planet will appear as a fairly bright starlike object not far from the sun. After that date it will come closer to the sun again and be lost in the sun's glare.
The next astronomical events can be seen with the naked eye, or with binoculars or a telescope. These are the eclipses of the sun and moon.

Total Eclipse of the Sun
The total eclipse of the sun on Feb. 25 will be visible throughout most of North America, with the moon completely covering the sun for more than two minutes. This will be the last total eclipse of the sun visible in the United States until 1963.

Trinidade Sightings...
(Continued from page 7)
The USAF SIGHTING of this Island was on the ocean several hundred miles southwest of Brazil, near the island of Trinidade, which is another small island belonging to the South Atlantic Ocean between the Brazilian coast and the Atlantic continent. Trinidade (it is believed) was the site of one of the CAS guided missiles fired from Cape Canaveral at the island of Ascension Island. The reason this was selected two years ago as the place for a U.S. guided missile shot is not known. The instruments and satellites connected with the military treaty between the two countries, the instruments and over the island of Trinidade and about the rocket-trails of the guided missiles and satellites-- were to be cooperated by American crews and Brazilian. As soon as the tracking station was built, it was put into operation together with the already existing tracking system met. Because of the Brazilian station arrival at Rio to see his family. He made some for a few weeks to take care as CAS sightings. (The observations that more instances of CAS sightings were made in Brazil than in the U.S. This was the first CAO sightings over Fernando Noronha)
An ICBM had been fired from the Atlantic Missile Range in Florida, and by the time it had traveled about 5,000 miles, reached a point some 180 miles north-east of the island, the crew saw a bright light just below the horizon. As it went south, it got rapidly brighter. They could see the rocket flame, and as it neared the island, the crew saw a bright light and a smaller light very close to it. They were able to track it back to earth, the crews at Fernando Noronha were reported an arrival of their island station. The radar at this target was picked up on the radar screen. It was the re-entry into the atmosphere of the missile. About 2 minutes later, another "rocket" was spotted moving down the same trajectory but disappeared before reaching the ground. The crews called to track one rocket out the radars had picked up two rockets. No explanation. There was no explanation, and the consensus, for some unknown reason, the crews said that the second "rocket" looked real, but it did not appear on the radar screen.
The "most rockets" continued to be picked up. However, almost every time, a guided missile was being tracked by the station, it was apparent that other rockets were real too. They were short, some kind of Fernando Noronha, and some quite real. It was found out that some came from the main land, and some times may came in pairs, sometimes singly, and sometimes disappeared indicating that the objects had been carrying out maneuvers or, perhaps, they followed the rocket they were tracking sometimes disappearing the whole rocket track.
On 16 March 1958, three more rockets were picked up on the radar screens, and a few seconds later, an official note confirming the photos' authenticity.
The flying saucer is not a ghost from some mysterious world. It is a fact confirmed by material evidence. The Air Force Communiqué and documents, photos, and sightings reports operating as a evidence, for example, discussed the A-12 Dragon Civil and military (AP officers) and citizens-- reported their existence, and no other better explanation for this high-powered optical instrument two hours the saucer was present in the sky, then the official conclusions of the observers, considering.

AN OPEN LETTER
TO AFRO READERS
For the past sixteen months or more, I have served as a director for APRO. I have done my best at all times, and would like to call the members' attention to the present emergency brought about by the relocation of headquarters to Tucson.

The main present objective, besides keeping itself, is to gather adequate supporting material to handle the large correspondence. This will take time, and during this time in which I will acquaint myself with newspapers and printing offices in the new location, I must take leave as a premium member. All the present new problems, mainly those concerning the administration of APRO offices, will be temporarily unattended.

There will be no July 1959 issue of the Bulletin because of the move. The next Bulletin will either be issued a later date of supplement with a figure layout as members due. The bulletins in the future will be issued as soon as the preparations complete. Till then, members will have to be patient.

Our next issue will be on the step-bystep military reconnaissance of the Colorado Springs, Colo., reports received by APRO in the past 3 years. This unusual report will lead to an explanation for the diversities of sightings over the cities.

The image contains a photograph that appears to be a flying saucer or unidentified flying object (UFO) sighted over the island of Trinidade, off the coast of Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean in January 1958. The object was observed and photographed by several sailors aboard a Brazilian Navy survey ship named Almirante Saldanha. The image and text describe this event as one of the most famous UFO photographs in early history, and the first instance where a country (Brazil) officially recognized the existence of "flying saucers".

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

Photographic evidence convinces the reality of "Flying Saucers" in 1960-61 was once again confirmed by the increased, the Brazilian Navy and Brasilian Congress re-confirmed proof that the "Saucers Exist" in 1960, when it confirmed the existence of photographs taken of a UFO near the Island of Trinidade Aboard the ISY SHIP" Almirante Saldanha" by photographers in January, 1958. This event was confirmed by hundreds of crew members aboard the ship and many others on shore. Brazil still remained the only country in the World that officially recognizes the existence of "flying saucers" in 1960-61.

On January 16, the most famous of UFO photographs in early years, proved to be a series of four photographs taken of a slow UFO in its flight path at Trinidade Island, off Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean by a sailor, aboard a Brazilian Navy ISY Survey Ship, named Almirante Saldanha. The object appeared shaped like the planet Saturn with rings around it. That photo so unusual was that it resulted in Brazil becoming the first country in the world to officially recognize the existence of "flying saucers". The strange object was seen on at least 8 different occasions, by at least 100 sailors aboard the ship, by dozens of persons on the island, twice through theodolites, as well as being photographed by a Navy sergeant on the island and seen close up on two occasions. Add to those facts, that the pictures were ordered released by the President of Brazil himself, and have been confirmed by both the Brazil Navy and the Brazil Congress and you've got quite a story.

LIGHTED OBJECT SIGHTER
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. 
January 18, 1958

On January 18, 1958 at approximately 10 and 11 p.m. Saturday, USAF personnel reported seeing a lighted object in the sky. In addition, many visitors in the area during these hours also observed this strange object. Fortunately, one of them, a pilot on temporary duty from the east coast, was able to give a complete description of the object. 

The object, according to this witness, was circular in shape, about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and appeared to be illuminated by a bright light, there or four times brighter than a star. It hovered for several minutes over the area, moving in a rectangular pattern above one of the buildings on the base. During this time, the witness was able to observe the object clearly, and could see that it was not a conventional aircraft. When it first appeared, it was moving in a horizontal direction, and then it changed to a vertical direction, hovering for several minutes over the base area.

Then it stopped and moved sideways, in a rectangular pattern, directly above one of the buildings on the base. This gave the witness an excellent opportunity to observe the object at close range. He said that the light was very bright, appeared to be pulsating, and that it was possible to see through it. After hovering for several minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and shot straight up into the sky at a tremendous speed, until it disappeared from sight.

The witness stated that when the object first appeared, it was about the size of a dime held at arm's length. During the time it was over the base, it increased in size to about the size of a half dollar held at arm's length. The witness also stated that he could not hear any sound from the object, and that it appeared to be completely silent in its operation.

This case was investigated by Lt. Col. (name redacted), who interviewed the witness, who was a reliable and experienced observer. The witness stated that he could not offer any explanation as to the nature of the object, and said that he had never seen anything like it before. When asked if he thought it might have been a conventional aircraft, he stated emphatically that it was not, and that he was certain that it was some type of unidentified flying object.

The case was discussed with other USAF personnel on the base, and they also stated that they had observed the object, and could not offer any explanation as to its nature. This is considered to be a valid sighting, and one which deserves further investigation.

"NO. CASE (Information Only)

30 January 1958
Between Arequipa and Lima, Peru

UFO Stalls Car Engines in Peru: On January 30 a Peruvian lawyer, Dr. [redacted], was driving from Arequipa to Lima with his wife and her brother. At 11:55 p.m. their Dodge 200 miles north of Arequipa on the Panamericana Highway, when their headlights went out and the engine died. The driver stopped the car. Then they noticed an object descending from the sky. As it neared a height of about 150 meters, it began to emit a sort of reddish 'explosion' (presumably orange-red) color. For 5 minutes it remained completely motionless, then disappeared into the cloudy sky. A truck and a bus going to Lima were also stopped. Dr. [redacted] said that in all three vehicles the passengers felt a nervous shock before the UFO appeared overhead. Trams (N.Y.): Feb. 1, 1958. (Same as France and Levelland, Texas; one assumes that a lawyer is not a hoaxer.)"
