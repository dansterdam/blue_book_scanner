1. A review of IR-1612-57 shows insufficient evidence on which to evaluate the sighting as a UFO sighting. As stated in the last sentence of Part II, even the observers were "sure that the objects were not ......... aircraft of any sort."

2. The relative size of the objects, the large one being 12 times the size of the smaller ones, is further evidence that rules out aircraft or missiles.

3. From the position of the observer with respect to a sun low in the horizon, it appears this particular cloud alone was drifting with the wind. The illusion of ascent or descent can be explained by the clouds blowing directly to or away from the observer.

1. PREFACE:
    a. SOURCE was friendly, talkative and very cooperative. He was a good
    observer, had a good memory and was a good judge of dimensions.

    b. In Aug 56 SOURCE was transferred by train with 250 other prisoners
    from Potma Camp, # 35(7) to Camp # 5/5/10 about 200 km north
    distance north of Potma. The unidentified flying objects were observed by
    SOURCE and many other prisoners the afternoon in the middle of Aug 56.
    Observation of the unidentified flying objects can be authenticated by
    [partially illegible text]

II. NARRATIVE ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS NEAR POTMA:

    One afternoon in the middle of Aug 56 (SOURCE did not remember the
    exact date) at a proximately 16:00 hours (1600), SOURCE (SOUZOV 356)
    was sitting in one of the camp barracks and talked to other prisoners. All
    of a sudden a prisoner burst into room with a "Come on, there is
    something peculiar to see in the sky". All prisoners immediately
    went outside and saw 4-5 flying objects of about 400-500 meters
    above ground level at an angle of about 45 degrees to the
    horizon. A cloud was visible and a blue object was moving
    well bright daylight and no wind.

    The flying objects appeared at first to be
    national in the sky and in the same direction. At the other end of the
    horizon a sort while the spheres were turning to the right and to the left at
    about a fast race (SOURCE was not able to judge the speed), and one
    down again (SOURCE was not able to make an estimate because there were no
    clouds). The objects were of a metallic appearance, normal in an
    elongated shape, a little bit higher than the others, this lasted only about a minute
    after which the objects went down. SOURCE remembers that he
    was a good hour point in front of the barrack. Then all of
    a sudden the objects traveled at high speed out of view. SOURCE could not
    remember the direction in which the objects had left. All the time during
    the observation SOURCE was watching the right of SOURCE which accounts maybe for
    the color of the sphere becoming lighter and darker individually. Absolutely
    no traces was made. All SOURCE were solid figures and no hallucinations
    insisted that he knows enough about balloons to identify them in the air).

    SOURCE could see several on the sphere (SOURCE was very possible about
    the objects form). No vapor trails were observed. All the prisoners were
    watching and an INTSEKCGT was sure that the objects were not
    Soviet experimental aircraft of any sort.

Observation referenced locale. Although SMGC refused to make statements
of positive identification of observed subjects, he almost almost certain that
objects were not balloons which gives rise to the suggestion that "Vertical
Take-off" type aircraft is a possible answer. An evaluation in request in
regard to validity of referencing.
