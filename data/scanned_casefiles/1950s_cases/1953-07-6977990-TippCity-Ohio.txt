DATE: 8 July 1953

Upon getting out of enclosed park at about 6:45 PM, attention was directed upward by a passing personnel plane. The object was of such brilliance that I was immediately told above and asked of the plane. It was more flying NW. The three others I was with also saw the object and were called and told to get of the object at that time it was stationary. After the plane passed the object moved rapidly upward at high speed, turned to the south out of a sharp angle and continuing to move very rapidly, finally disappeared either to cause of distance or in the clouds. Clouds were dense in the south then over. Approx.

"Flying Disk" Story Studied
AT Officers Ponder
Tipp Man's Report

Still unresolved—and still a subject of analysis—is the Technical Intelligence center officers at Wright-Patterson Air Force base report of a "flying saucer" seen by a Tipp City man July 3.

The man, Wilbur H. Focht, a Wright-Patterson employee, has been interviewed personally and has been interviewed according to the incident, according to the AFIC.

"All we know thus far" said a spokesman, "is that the object might have been a weather balloon."

Though a check revealed that no balloon was up from this area at the time, he could have been an upper air current balloon. It was stationary at an altitude higher than a plane which was flying overhead at the time.

After the plane was gone, Focht told the officials he saw the object when he stepped outside his Tipp City home about 8:15 p.m. It was stationery and turned south and, moving rapidly, vanished behind a cloud bank.

1. Attention invited to enclosed copy of letter to Director of Intelligence, HQ USAF, dated 7 July 1952.

2. Enclosed also are exposed film and "U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheets". Although the object has been identified as weather balloon the data is being forwarded for the possibility of suggestions or recommendations concerning use of cameras. It should be noted that film (20) exposed in Lowry (20) cameras (36) forwarded by your office. The photographer was unable to obtain the film you had sent, therefore he procured these and did not notice the number of exposures until cameras had jammed. The exposed film was removed by a qualified technician in base Photo Lab dark room. The technician reports that sprocket holes are ripped out and possibility of double exposure exists.
