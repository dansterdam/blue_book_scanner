AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(1) DESCRIPTION:
Several observers reported seeing a luminous object described as a rotating disc with distinct shape and definite motion, which was observed for about 10 to 15 minutes. The object appeared to have a bright, white color, similar to the color and luster of a weld. It had a circular shape and seemed larger than a star or planet. The object was observed to make definite maneuvers and was seen to change directions several times.

(2) ADDITIONAL DETAILS:
The object was first observed at about 8:40 PM on 6 July 1957, over Hastings, Michigan. The object was observed by two independent groups of observers, and all agreed on the general description of the object. The object was seen to move in a horizontal path, then make a turn and move in a vertical path, and then turn again and move in a horizontal path. The object was seen to accelerate and decelerate during its observed movements. It was seen to fade in and out of visibility at times. The object was observed for about 10 to 15 minutes and then disappeared from view.

Dear Mr. Grace
Pentagon 
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sir:

What you told me some time ago about sighting a strange object with flashing lights, which you thought might be an unidentified flying object, or what is commonly called a "flying saucer", has been troubling me. I want you to know that I think there is more to this than meets the eye. I know what these things are supposed to look like, and I think your report is valid. Please let me know if you have any other information.

Sincerely yours,

September 18, 1963

Dear Sirs,

In response to your request of September 9, 1963, for some information on the subject of unidentified aerial phenomena, we think these information may be of interest to you.

There have been a number of sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena over the United States during the past years. These lights were later identified by the Air Force as being caused by the testing of aircraft in the area at that time.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,

Would you please send me some information about sighting reports that have been reported. I would like to get some idea of the different types of sightings that have been reported in our country, to see if any of the descriptions match what I saw. I saw 5 lights, as you know, on the 3 July 1957.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

September 18, 1963

Dear Sir,

This letter is in reply to your letter of September 9, 1963, concerning "Flying Saucers".

We are enclosing two brochures on unidentified aerial phenomena including some sightings over the United States.

We hope they will be of interest to you.

The five lights over Port Huron which you referred to in your letter were probably related to the "Air Force as a B-47 air refueling mission which was taking place in that area at that time.

Sincerely,

MAJOR H. J. JACKS
