Case 200, Ft. Collins and Loveland, Colo., Aug. 24, 26, 27, 29, 1956—Nothing timid about the Denver Post headlines which prefaced a day-by-day account of the activities of a UFO seen over Northern Colorado. The mystery object not only caused the telephone switchboards of the police department and newspapers to be swamped with calls, but caused embarrassment to the experts who tried to explain it away. Most observers agreed, that the witnesses, and a reporter for radio station KCOL, said the object glowed "intensely red" one night, dimishing in intensity toward the outer borders. He said the stars have been a star, he said. "It was a clear night, the larger than a star, and it was a bright red, much it were leaving a very slight smoke trail." Another witness said it was just a little "smaller than the moon." Moving very slowly in the sky, sometimes in the moon-balllike-disk-shaped and then it would change to a fades shape. When it finally disappeared, it seemed to move only though it were passing behind a cloud. The was clear in that area, and some observers thought the explanation is that the observers thought it might be Mars, but Dr. Gordon Newkirk, astronomer at the University of Colorado ruled out this explanation, thus: "Whatever it was, it appeared to the wrong sector of the sky to be Mars." Said Newkirk: "Meteorological balloons are now seen on these balloons nowadays, since radar after a better method of following a balloon." A check with nearby AFB instruments formerly carried lights and scientists in tracking them at night. Such lights are aid to aid in the balloon release of aircraft flight the meteorological phenomenon. Said Capt. George Sanderson, meteorologist at Lowry AFB, "Recurrence of an inversion an unlikely explanation in this case."
