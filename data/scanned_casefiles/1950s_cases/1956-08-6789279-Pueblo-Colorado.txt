The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a project record card from Project 10073 of the Project Blue Book, which was a systematic study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force from 1947 to 1969.

The text on the record card is as follows:

1. DATE: 6 August 56
2. TIME: 1900 hrs
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1900 56208
4. LOCATION: Pueblo, Colorado
5. PHOTOS: None
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Visual
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2-3 minutes
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Objects moved at very high speed, Radar confirmation
9. COURSE: Easterly
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION: Objects seen by ground-radar visual observation. Bright lights or objects were maneuverable and extremely fast, some estimated to be in excess of 1,000 mph. Objects disappeared and reappeared at irregular intervals. Visual confirmation by radar.
11. CONCLUSIONS: V.S. Unknown, Radar Confirmed, Possibly Balloon.

Transcribed text:

Case 200, Ft. Collins and Laramie, Colo., Aug. 24, 25, 1956 - Nothing timid about the manner of the object which projected a dark silhouette against the background of the night sky. The mystery object was only caused the telephone switchboard and newspapers to be swamped with calls from persons who were trying to explain it away. Most eyewitnesses agreed that the object glowed bright red in the center and seemed to show stars around it. Air Force spokesmen claimed that a balloon might have accounted for this sighting, but certain eyewitnesses stated that the object was clear and larger than any balloon. They felt that if this was a balloon, stars were out, but this object was brighter and larger than any stars. It seemed to change shape and direction from time to time. This object was seen in the area for several nights. It could not be tracked on radar nor were any balloon or aircraft installations in the area able to detect it. The recurrence of the Ft. Collins object for several nights, however, is unlikely explanation is this elusive temperature inversion.
