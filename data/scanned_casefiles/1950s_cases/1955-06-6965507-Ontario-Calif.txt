The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically an UFOB (Unidentified Flying Object) Index Card. The card provides details about an unidentified sighting that occurred on June 15, 1955 in Ontario, California. The key details from the text are:

1. DATE: 15 JUNE 1955
2. LOCATION: Ontario, California
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: GMT 18/0415 Z JUN 55
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. SOURCE: Civilian
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one (1)
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: approx 2 minutes
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: One (1) silver object, which appeared to have a dome, was observed to flutter down from an undetermined altitude. The observer stated that the object appeared to float periodically, and then descend in a commanded course.
11. COMMENTS: Due to the "realism" description of this sighting and the improbability of further information uncovering additional identifications, this sighting was authorized. From the information received in the preliminary report, this sighting is resolved as POSSIBLY BALLOON.
