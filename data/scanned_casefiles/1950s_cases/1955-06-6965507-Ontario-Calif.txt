One (1) silver object, which appeared to have a delta wing or some type of projections, was observed to a 11,000 ft. from an undetermined altitude. The observer stated that object appeared to float periodically, and then to resume its downward course.

11. COMMENTS
Due to the "classic" description of this sighting, and the improbability of further investigation uncovering additional information, no follow-up investigation was authorized. From the information received in the preliminary report, this sighting is received as POSSIBLE BALLOON.
