AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 
UNCLASSIFIED

TITLE: Radar Observation of Unidentified Flights. 
DATE: 17-11-53
PLACE: Wisconsin-Michigan
-------------------------------------------------------
(1) SUBJECT OF INTELLIGENCE:
Radar observation of unidentified objects by radar stations in the Michigan-Wisconsin area. 

(2) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS:
Radar pips indicating that unidentified objects were observed in the area on several occasions.

(3) TIME: Approximately 1750Z to 1813Z continuing in other areas as late as 1913Z.

(4) LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: 
Observers at T-21 and T-23. (Object's altitude could not be estimated because of great differences in radar indications.) Great Lakes Early Warning Radar Sites located at 47 miles north of Milwaukee, Wisconsin and 32 miles south of Kalamazoo, Michigan.

(5) DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 
Electronic speed estimated at 6000 FT/MINUTE. Time of observation varied greatly, altitude could not be estimated because of great differences in radar indications.

(6) ACTIVITY OF OBJECTS:
Unidentified objects observed performing various maneuvers. Sudden acceleration, sharp turns, and extreme high speed noted. Objects at times almost stationary, at other times traveling at extremely high speed. Course of targets reportedly erratic, ranging from 20 to 60 miles. Observers reported that targets were lost at 60 miles because of limitations of radar equipment.

(7) WEATHER CONDITIONS:
Weather clear, calm, good visibility. No other air traffic in area.

(8) MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION:
Observers described objects as round, bright and silvery in appearance. No sound or exhaust noted. Action of objects was apparently intelligently controlled. No known aircraft capable of performance described. Radar observance experienced at both locations simultaneously. Coordination between sites indicated.
