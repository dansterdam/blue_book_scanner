10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Intermittant radar blips similar to large a/c only somewhat larger. Oblong in shape. Appeared as new plot on several occasions. Observed from 18/1035Z to 18.1131Z and as late as 18/1355Z in locations to north of reporting station. Speeds varied with max at 6,000 mph. Altitude not estimated because of great ground haze. Heavy moisture content, 2 P-86 a/c scrambled with negative results. Adjacent radar stations encountered similar plots.

11. COMMENTS
Ducting due to heavy ground fog believed a possibility. Same phenomena has occurred in less violent form in area previously under like weather conditions.

☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft

AF FORM 112-PART II
UNCLASSIFIED

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Director of Intelligence, EADF                 IR-44-9513                     PAGE    2    OF    2

Ref. Par. 5a(1) - ADCL 200-1

(a) A brief description of the object. Radar blip identical to that of aircraft only larger. Oblong in shape. No tail ever observed in turn, appeared as raw plot on several occasions.

(b) Time. 181035Z to 181135Z and continuing in other areas to north as late as 181355Z.

(c) Manner of observation. Electronic speed estimated at 6000 ft. although it varied greatly. Altitude could not be estimated because of great speed. Electronic equipment was 1/4 mile at P-31 (Elkhorn) and P-34 (Sparta).

(d) Location of observer. Observers at P-31 and P-34. Object first plotted approximately 50 miles east Milwaukee. Eleven minutes later at 50 miles east Saltridge, then to 20 miles south Milwaukee to 60 miles northwest Saltridge to 80 miles southeast Saltridge to 60 miles south Calumet, Michigan to 10 miles northeast Osoda, to 50 miles northeast Fort Huron to 20 miles Ste Marie to 60 miles northeast Port Huron to 65 miles south of Calumet to 35 miles northwest of Milwaukee to 100 miles northeast Sault Ste Marie to 10 miles north of Bay City.

(e) Identifying information on observers. Experienced operations personnel at both locations observed blips.

(f) Weather and wind conditions. Milwaukee weather sequence 181000Z tailwind 092/19/10 northwest to 1/999. Generally heavy ground fog over area with light ground haze.

(g) Any activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting. Ground fog with high moisture content. Various Coast Guard, Geneva, Wis. reports observations not made during night of 17-18 September 1951. Ground log 17 Sept 1951 shows no known ground activity for period but report shows there occurred within last several hours. No known Coast Guard, Wis. or Mich. activity. No observers on duty at time of period in question. Report no local or area ground activity or meteoric showers in past several days.

(h) Clearance or any physical science. Negative.

(i) Interception or identification action taken. 2 F-86 from Geiger scramble at 181035Z - negative results.

(j) Local aircraft airborne at the time of sighting. Not believed applicable due to range of target and conditions.

Additional information: Adjoining eastern station at P-21 (Ft. Wilson, Minn.) reports no similar tangible. P-69 (Finland, Minn.) picked up similar tangible approximately 181307Z and faded after being plotted on varying bearings over widely dispersed area.

Conclusion. Sighting due to heavy ground fog believed a possibility. Some type of phenomenon but cannot be identified with any degree of certainty under current condition.
