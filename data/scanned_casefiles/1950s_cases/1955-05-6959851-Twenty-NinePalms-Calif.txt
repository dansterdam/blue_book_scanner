The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically an "UFOB INDEX CARD" that provides details about a UFO sighting.

Here is the text output from the document:

3. DATE-TIME GROUP  
    Local: 4.50-5.10 PM 6 May 1955

5. DURATION  approx 2 minutes
6. SOURCE  Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION approx 2 minutes
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS  ONE (1)
9. COURSE  Western direction
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING  One (1) object was observed at a five degree elevation off the horizon. It appeared to be in the air and then to disappear. After checking astronomidal charts, it is impossible that observed object was any celestial body or other astronomical object. There are other indications or unusual aerial activity in the area of sighting, according to the report made by the AFOSR squadron. However, the description of the sighting, which includes the weather conditions which the witness reported, is judged to indicate that sighting was probably a balloon.
