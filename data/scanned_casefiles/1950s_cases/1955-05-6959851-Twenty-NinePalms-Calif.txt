10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1), white, object was observed at a five degree elevation off the horizon. It appeared to hang in the sky and then to disappear to the west. The observer estimated that the object was round and approximately three (3) feet in diameter.

11. COMMENTS
After checking astronomical charts, it is improbable that observed object was a star or any other astronomical object. In addition, there are no other indications of unusual aerial activity in the area of sighting. The organization which processed this report was an AGRON Squadron. However, from the description of the sighting, in conjunction with the weather report, which would provide a drifting balloon, it is judged that sighting was POSSIBLY a balloon.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical

□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
□ Unknown
