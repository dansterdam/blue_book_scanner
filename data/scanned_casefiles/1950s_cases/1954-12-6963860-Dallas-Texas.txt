The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page states that "A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION HAS NOT BEEN CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE IF THERE COULD HAVE BEEN OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE SIGHTING OTHER THAN THAT REPORTED IN THIS MSG. THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES CONCERNED HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED AND LIFE AND PROPERTY DESIRABLE MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SITUATION." The text also indicates that "NO FURTHER ACTION IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THIS GIVEN TO CONDUCTING A MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION BY THE 4822D AFSEA PARA 1 2/3/52 DEC 55."

OCR output:

PAGE THREE UFOS 546
AVAL TO INTERVIEWING OFF. A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION HAS NOT BEEN CONDUCTED
TO DETERMINE IF THERE COULD HAVE BEEN OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE
SIGHTING OTHER THAN THAT REPORTED IN THIS MSG. THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES
