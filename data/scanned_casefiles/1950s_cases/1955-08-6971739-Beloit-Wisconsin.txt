I. SOURCE: Mrs. [redacted]
    Address: [redacted], Beloit, Wisconsin
    Age: 36
    Occupation: House wife
    Education: One and one half (1½) years of High School
    Qualifications: GOC Observer from 12 May 1955 to date, with
                    total of 248 hrs observer duty.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was unable to estimate distances accurately by
sight. Would not even attempt to sketch drawing of sightings. The source did not
appear to have background experience with could aid in reporting a UFO.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was on duty at Ground Observer
Corps post located in Summit Park, Beloit, Wisconsin. At 1200200 August 1955, an
object the size of a baseball held at arms length, bright white to bright red in
color resembling a bright star flashed across the sky, traveling in a north to
south direction at great speed. Similar star like objects appeared throughout a five
hour period at intervals of two to three minutes. Direction of travel was north to
south, and south to north. Length of time visible varied from portion of a second
to the maximum two seconds. There was no regularity in the appearing of the objects
in regard to where they appeared on sky, the time between objects or length of time
visible.

The objects could not be sighted with binoculars due to the great speed of
travel and very short duration of visibility.

The GOC observation platform is located so as to permit excellent view of the
sky to the north, east and south, vision to the west is obstructed by a wall.

The first object was sighted in the north. The weather was clear and dry with
slight breeze blowing, and temperature was in the low seventies (70).

The sighting was reported to Mr. [redacted] GOC Supervisor, and GOC
Filter Center.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-A, 4602D AISS                                   AISS 3-A-UF0B-1-56                Part Three    Page 4 of 7 Pages

I. SOURCE: Mr. Harold W. Varney
Address: 835 Bluff St., Beloit, Wisconsin
Age: 41
Occupation: High School Graduate
Qualifications: Three years GOC experience; present position of GOC Supervisor.

II. RELIABILITY: Source changed his original opinion about the sighting, after serious thought, and some layman type research on the subject to satisfy personal curiosity, to the fact that these bodies were "falling stars" or meteorite activity entering the earth's atmosphere.

He indicated that his first opinion, that objects were UFOBs, had been influenced by the reporting GOC observer. The statements offered by the source are believed accurate and in keeping with his education and experience, as a GOC Supervisor.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGHTINGS: No observation of the sighting was made while en route from the source's home to GOC post and he could not note the sighting for twenty minutes after arriving at the GOC observer platform. The GOC observer reporting the sighting aided Mr. Varney and finally the objects were sighted. The star-like objects, varying in size from the size of a baseball to a quarter held at arm's length, appeared at various points in the sky, seemingly in the path of the "Milky Way", and would be visible for extremely short periods; less than it took the source to complete a breathing cycle. Direction of travel seemed to be limited to the length of the path of the "Milky Way", either north to south or south to north.

It was also noted by the source that the path of the "Milky Way" seemed to change direction slightly during the hours of observation of sightings. The star-like objects seemed to appear irregularly at intervals of two to five minutes.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was cooperative, but limited the discussion to twelve minutes due to having to meet a farmer concerning a gravel hauling job. Source had been given a riding, about having made the report of the sightings by the local town people and seems to have lost much of the apparent original enthusiasm of reporting the sightings.

Source's answers to questions concerning the incident were of a light passing nature with an accompanying smile and usually laughter. Since there was a six day period between the actual sighting and the interview, source was not quick to answer and gave several overall statements, rather than clear point to point answers.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGHTINGS: At about 0405 hours, Central Daylight Saving Time, on morning of 8 Aug 1955, source was awakened by a noise similar to the drone of an electric motor, and saw a brighter than usual sky thru the south-east windows of the first floor bedroom of his home. The source arose to investigate further, and noticed four bright round objects in Formation in the lower south-western portion of the sky. Binoculars were used to view objects and showed the objects appeared to be spinning. One object was about three feet in diameter, the other three much smaller, less than a quarter of the size of the larger object.

The objects seem to have the illuminating color of a fire-fly or lightning bug and as the objects would "drift" the under side appeared orange or flame like in color. The objects would seem to stand still for awhile then move quite rapidly then slow down and stand still again. Direction of travel was to the south-east. There seemed to be a change of color and a sort of exhaust or vapor trail made when the objects moved.

Mr. Miller's wife also saw the objects but only added the statement "It was a weird night". The information on the sightings. The Night Chief of Police, city of Morengo, Illinois, was called to Mr. Miller's home and was reported to have seen the objects prior to their disappearing into the daylight. The police officer could not pass the objects through the binoculars because of the bi-focal losses of his eye glasses.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. The Planetarium (diler & Astronomical Museum, 900 E. Nolsam Bond,
Chicago, Illinois, phone Wabash 2148), was contacted in regards to meteor activity
on or about 11 August 1955.

Mr. Schlesinger, director of the Planetarium reported that the Perseid
Meteor Shower occurs during the month of August, reaching a maximum of activity
on the 12th of August. The meteor shower path is along the "Milky Way" and
if viewed from a clear area the number of meteors that could be observed is
approximately one per minute.

Mr. Schlesinger offered the following opinions when told the details of
the sightings. The Beloit, Wisconsin, sighting was undoubtedly the Perseid Meteor
Shower. It is highly probable the Marengo, Illinois, sighting was jet aircraft as
viewed in the effect of the high then scattered clouds and the sun rays at day
break at 30,000 feet altitude.

2. Captain H. W. Nelson, Operations Officer, 42d Ftr. Int. Sq., 50lst AB
Group, O'Hare International Airport, Park Ridge, Illinois, reported jet type fighter
aircraft (F-86-D) of his organization flying in the area visible to Marengo, Illinois,
during the early morning of 8 August 1955.

3. The 765th AC & W Sq., Williams Bay, Wisconsin, sender of original TT
message, was contacted. They give a negative report on possible cause of any of the
sightings on the nights of 8, 9, 10 and 12 August 1955.

4. The 18th Weather Detachment, 12th Weather Squadron, Major McClurg,
Officer in Charge, was contacted. The weather report for the morning of 8 August
1955 for Rockford, Illinois, (20 miles west of the Marengo, Illinois, sighting)
was partially from night, to four (4) AM data, clear and 15 miles, at four to
five AM est., clear and 12 miles at 6:30 est., thin high scattered clouds at 30,000
feet. The opinion was stated that the thin high scattered cloud were probably
there during most of the night, but not picked up and reported until after day light.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The TT message, D/T8OOT, 2834, from the 775th AO & W Sq., Williams Bay, Wisconsin, upon which this investigation was based was a continuation of two different UFOB sightings, in two different locations at two different times of the month, (hereby expressly confusing the investigator initially).

2. An attempt was made to contact both the Mayor and Chief of Police of Beloit, however, when approached, the Chief of Police stated that he knew nothing of the sighting, and also that Beloit has no Mayor.

3. In regard to the Beloit sighting, in accordance with my own studies of astronomy and the many times I have observed similar meteors, and in accordance with Mr. Schlesinger's experience and information about the Perseid meteor shower, I am inclined to agree with both him and Mr. Varney, that the Beloit sighting was part of the Perseid meteor shower.

4. In view of the weather conditions on the morning of 8 August (thin scattered clouds at 30,000 feet) and the known fact that aircraft of the 42nd FIS were participating in early morning flights at the time of the sighting plus the fact that Mr. Miller had just awakened and was reluctant to make any concrete statements, I assume what he saw was a jet type aircraft plus its reflections in the clouds.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the Beloit, Wisconsin sighting was generated by astronomical activity, i.e., the annual August meteor showers.

2. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting by dir- [cut off] at Morengo, Illinois, was possibly caused by jet aircraft known to be operating in the vicinity.
