I. SOURCES: 
Address
Age: 30
Occupation: House wife
Education: One and one half (1-1/2) years of High School 
Qualifications: OGO Observer from 12 May 1955 to date, with serial of 234 hrs observer/duty.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was a reliable observer and was aware of activities. The source did not sight the object reported in the report.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was on duty at Ground Observer Corps post located in Summit Park, Beloit, Wisconsin. At 1902:02 August 1955, an object was observed in the north-east direction at great speed. Similar star like objects appeared throughout a five second period at interval of three to four seconds duration. The objects varied from north to south direction from horizon to horizon and then disappeared on the southern horizon. No sound was detected. The object could not be sighted with binoculars due to the great speed of travel and very short duration of visibility.

The GOC observation platform is located so as to permit unobstructed vision to the north, east and south. Vision to the west is obstructed by a wall.
The first object was sighted in the north. The weather was clear and dry with a slight breeze blowing. The temperature was in the low seventies (70's).
The sighting was reported to Mr. XXXX, GOC Supervisor, and GOC Director.

AIR FORM 112—PART II
APPROVED 13 JUNE 1951

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO.: A-B3-A
UFO-8-1-55

I. SOURCE: Mr. Harold W. Varney 
Address: 335 Bluff St., Beloit, Wisconsin
Age: 41
Occupation: High School Graduate
Qualifications: Three years GCG experience; present position of GCO supervisor
II. RELIABILITY: Source changed his original opinion about the sighting, after various thoughts, and some layman type research on the subject to satisfy himself. His original opinion was that the objects were UFOBS, but later GCO observations made him doubtful. He indicated that his first opinion, that objects were UFOBS, had been influenced by the source of his preliminary information.
III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGHTINGS: No observation of the sighting was made while en route from the source's home to GCO post and he could not note any unusual conditions in the sky. The sighting of the objects was first noticed by the GCO observer and he was called to the post to observe the objects himself. The star-like objects, varying in size from the size of a baseball to a pinpoint, were observed for approximately 3 hours. Their movement appeared to be erratic with no set pattern. They were observed to the south or south to north.
IT WAS ALSO NOTED BY THE SOURCE THAT THE PATH OF THE "MILLER" MAY SEEMED TO CHANGE DIRECTION SLIGHTLY DURING THE HOURS OF OBSERVATION OF SIGHTINGS. THE DURATION OF THE SIGHTINGS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY TWO TO FIVE MINUTES.

Education: High School Graduate
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: Source was cooperative, but limited the discussion to twelve minutes due to a cold. He had been given a brief briefing about having made the report of the sightings by the police officers involved.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGHTINGS: At about 0405 hours, Central daylight saving time, on the morning of 6 August 1955, the source was awakened by a noise "like a blast from an airplane". He looked out and saw four bright round objects in formation in the southeast to northeast sky. The objects appeared to be about a quarter mile away and about 1000 feet high. The objects would go straight, then make sharp turns, and then resume the straight course. They would also tilt on their sides. The objects appeared to be four to five feet in diameter and were illuminated with a fire-fly or lightning bug type of illumination. The illumination appeared to fluctuate and change color from white to red. The objects were under intelligent control and made no sound that could be heard. The source watched the objects for about ten minutes, and then they disappeared into the daylight. The police were called but could not locate the objects prior to their disappearing into the daylight. The police officer could not substantiate the informant's account because the sightings occurred at a time when the objects could not be found.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:

1. The Planetarium, Adler & Astronomical Museum, 900 S. Ashland Road, Chicago, Illinois, whose Telescope Trailer 21425, was observed in regard to activity on or about 11 August 1955.

2. Meteor showers occurred during the month of August, reaching a maximum on 13 August. The number of meteors visible from a clear area the number of meteors that could be observed is approximately 100 per hour.

3. Mrs. Schlessinger offered the following opinions when she told the details of the sighting. The sighting was undoubtedly the planet Venus which is frequently observed in the correct direction and at about the same intensity, and viewed in the effect of the high then scattered clouds and the sun rays at dusk.

4. Captain R. W. Nelson, Operations Officer, 2nd ATS, Sq., Joliet, Illinois, Officer on Duty, 13 August 1955, stated that their aircraft (F-80-P) of his organization flying in the area visible to Beloit, Illinois, during the evening hours of 13 August 1955.

5. The 785th AC & W Sq., Wl. Williams Bay, Wisconsin, sender of original IT message, were instructed to investigate to possible cause of the sighting, and reported negative results.

6. The 18th Weather Detachment, 9th Weather Squadron, Major McClurg, Scott AFB, Illinois, made a report of weather conditions on 13 August 1955 for the area of Rockford, Illinois. The weather at the time reported hazy with scattered clouds at 30,000 feet, and visibility at 12 miles at the time.

FLIGHT 2-A 4602D AISS AISS 2-A-UFOB-1-55 PART ONE OF 7 PAGES

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: 
1. As the message, D/USDC, 2334, from the 775th A& G W Sq., Williams AFB, Arizona, indicates, the sighting of the Unidentified Flying Object, as reported by the pilot of the F-86 aircraft, is rather confusing and results in the investigator initially being at odds with the Chief of Police in Beloit. However, when approached, the Chief of Police stated that he knew nothing about the sighting. 

2. In regard to the Beloit sighting, in accordance with the way we studies astronomical and the many times of object sightings, and in accordance with Mr. Hynek's experience and information about the mirage, it is logical to consider that the phenomena may have been a mirage.

3. In view of the weather conditions on the morning of 6 August (thin scattered clouds at 30,000 feet) and the facts that pilot flights were participating in early morning flights at the time of the sighting, plus the fact that Mr. Hillner's observations indicated a jet type aircraft plus its reflections in the clouds, it is considered that the sighting may have been a jet type aircraft plus its reflections in the clouds.

RONALD E. LIEB
2LT USAF
OFFICER IN CHARGE

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER: 
1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the Beloit, Wisconsin sighting was generated by astronomical activity, i.e., the annual August meteor shower.

2. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting by Mr. Hillner in Beloit was possibly caused by jet aircraft known to be operating in the vicinity.
