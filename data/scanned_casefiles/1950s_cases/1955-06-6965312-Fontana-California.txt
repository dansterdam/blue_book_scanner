During the period 8 Jun 55 to 8 Jul 55 the observer had noted round objects in the sky at night. The objects are red and flashing or yellow and steady.

11. COMMENTS
A check of Radio Facility Charts reveals the observer is located with an aerodrome on the east, an aerodrome on the west and a beacon light on the north. Flight path to Edwards AFB is over observer's house. It is the opinion that the observer has been a combination of a/c lights and the beacon. Also, the observer is located in a well populated area and a well-lit area.

A check of Radio Facility Charts reveals                                
the observer is located with an aerodrome                               
on the east, an aerodrome on the west and                               
a beacon light on the north. Flight path                                
to Edwards AFB is over observer's house.                                
It is the opinion of this log that the                                  
observer has seen a combination of a/c                                  
lights and the beacon. Also, the ob-
