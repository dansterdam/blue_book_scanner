is susceptible to having its radiated beam bent by "anomalous propagation" which affects the radar beam at angles which are nearly tangent to the "duct" layer.

The effects reported by the radar station, 663rd Aircraft and "arming squadron, located at the McGhee-Tyson Airc raft, Knoxville, Tennessee on the nights of 29 and 30 Nov 1950, are considered to be due to a rather mild (compared to the same effects observed on this type equipment at other locations) "duct" effect.

Major Steel, AMC Procurement and Security officer on the NEPA project was advised to arrange with the weather station at Oak Ridge to have atmospheric soundings of temperature and humidity made during subsequent occurrences of the "duct" phenomenon.

The Oak Ridge weather station has the necessary equipment, a captive balloon wire sonic, to make these soundings. Such soundings were not available for the period of detection of unknown radar targets. It was also recommended that equipment be requisitioned making radar scope photographs of subsequent occurrences of the detection of unknown targets, photos to be made at one-two minute intervals.

It is of interest to note that flights of ducks have been detected on the AN/CPS-1 radar set at this location and intercept aircraft have intercepted this type target.

Ducks were detected at an altitude of 6000 feet.

It appears that several individuals at Oak Ridge were extremely concerned with the possible tie-in between earlier incidents especially one regarding a report received from a farmer Oak Ridge trooper to the effect that he had aided two men and a woman having

difficulty with a truck in the mountains in the Oak Ridge area on 30 Mar 1950.

It was stated that this truck was on a seldom used road and was carrying a partially covered silver colored cylindrical object. The occupants reportedly spoke with a foreign accent. However, from the standpoint of technical intelligence, it appears that there is no relation between the two incidents. There are no electronic countermeasures known to this department that would cause such radar targets as those reported on 29 and 30 November 1950.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

At 1765 hours on 29 November 1950, numerous unidentified paints (objects) appeared on the radar scopes of the 662nd AW Radar Detachment, located at McGhee Tyson Airport, Knoxville, Tennessee. These paints, so numerous that they almost covered the "Restricted Area" at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, seemed to originate near the center of the "Restricted Area's" northwest boundary and travelled southeast at about six (6) miles per hour. As the paints crossed the "Restricted Area" (an indicated ten mile radius), more of ten tended to change direction slightly so as to travel east-southeast. It appeared that these "paints" might be slightly affected by the wind which was from the southwest at six (6) miles per hour. Those objects were estimated at 2500 - 3000 feet above ground level, and they could not be sighted on the radar high scope until they were within ten (10) miles of the Radar Station.

From the original source, the objects appeared to gain altitude as they proceeded across the "Restricted area". The maintenance personnel checked the radar equipment in a fruitless attempt to find malfunctions, and the controller switched the radar set from "high to low beam", etc., doing everything he could to verify the readings, except to change the frequency of the radar equipment. The controller also called another Radar Unit to compare data. The finding and the above information was verified by this person. The controllers describe their observations of the radar scope as "strangely cluttered with paints" as though pellets from a shotgun pellets were poured onto a table and allowed to go across it. (The table being the "Restricted Area".)

The paints varied from 290 degrees to 350 degrees at from ten (10) to twenty-six (26) miles distance from the Radar Station, and they would appear, disappear, paint bright and paint dim at various times.

A fighter aircraft was sent to intercept one or any of the targets and was vectored through, and around, specific targets and was vectored through, and ground, an area in which many paints appeared, but no visual contact was reported by either the pilot or the observers. Initial counting equipment was contemplated on 30 November 1950, at which time representatives from the NEPA Division, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, inspected the aircraft for the possibility of said installations. Most of the targets were visible on the radar scopes for two or three hours, and a few could still be seen at 0600 on 30 November 1950.

The graph record of a background (Geiger) counter in the "Restricted Area" indicated a pronounced rise in Alpha particles at 1900 hours on 29 November 1950, and a slight rise in Gamma rays at the same time. These Alpha particles and Gamma rays were unassociated for at the present time. Atomic Energy Commission officials advise that there were no known "Argon releases" (Argon gas) at that time.

Summary of Information:

charged with radioactive particles) during 29 and 30 November 1950.

On 30 November 1950 (during the presence of CIC and OSI representatives from 111th CIC Detachment and 6th OSI District) at 1851 hours, a single unidentified target appeared on the radar scopes. Following is the controllers notes of the objects progress:

Time (hours)    Range (miles)    Azimuth (degrees from Radar Station)
1851            21               517
1854            17               210
1400            15               300
1402            14               25

1405            12               25

At this time the target disappeared from the scope.

At approximately 1630 hours, on 30 November 1950, unaccountable paints reappeared on the radar scopes and these generally followed a similar pattern, as described before. In addition to the regular radar crew, the following persons were present to witness these targets:

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

The Weather Division at the Oak Ridge Atomic Energy Commission reports the following concerning the weather during the above period:

Wind           Speed           Altitude        Mean Sea Level
(degrees)      (miles per hour)                 (feet)

210            8               Surface         800 Feet
250            12              1200 Feet       2000 Feet
240            14              2200 Feet       3000 Feet
260            22              3200 Feet       4000 Feet

The temperature at this time (1000 hours on 29 November 1950) was 52 degrees at the surface, 50 degrees at 500 feet (1500 feet mean sea level), and 27 degrees at 1000 feet (1800 feet mean sea level). There were no such observations taken on 30 November 1950 but the temperature was listed as 45 degrees at 1830 hours.

The possibility that the Geiger counters in the "restricted area" are receiving indications from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory plants is rejected because at 500 feet from the plants' "stack" there is only a 1/10th tolerance of radiation (tolerance threshold, natural background radiation that a human body can stand under continuous exposure for ones entire life, without affecting the persons health). Also rejected is the possibility that normal physiological radiation measures, such as radium radiation through the ground from radium, etc., in the earth could cause the Geiger counter readings found in the "restricted area", because said radium is a minute concentration generally measured at 1/1000th tolerance of that generated at 500 feet from the Atomic "stack".

Recent experiments designed to ascertain the effect of "Argon releases" on radar have shown that such releases cause no interference or any indication on the radar screens at the Knoxville Radar Station. Prearrangements between the Radar Station and the Weather Division at Atomic Energy Commission, for the release of Argon, were made and at the time of release (one of which was a full power release) there were no radar indications. Thereafter, a previous belief that such releases were being registered on the radar screens has been disproved.

1. SUMMARY: From 1715, 29 November until 2400 hours, 30 November 1950 unidentified objects appeared at various times on the scope of the AF Radar Station, Knoxville, Tennessee over the Controlled Area of Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

2. DETAILS: At 1715 hours, 29 November 1950, three (3) unidentified points (objects) appeared on the radar scope of the AF 1261st AC&W Ground Proficiency Aircraft, Knoxville, Tennessee. These points were over the Oak Ridge Controlled Area and they were not aircraft as they were moving at a speed of about six miles per hour. By 1755 the scopes had been cluttered with radar points. These objects appeared to have originated near the ground at the center of the northwest boundary of the Controlled Area and were traveling and ascending at a slow rate of speed in a southwesterly direction over the Controlled Area. At one point, objects, now at an altitude of 2000 to 3,100 feet, came over the center of the Controlled Area they moved or fanned out and some changed directions to west south west and to west. Two (2) radar sites, the SCG dropped at one point (10) to twenty six (26) miles from the radar station and they would appear, disappear, main bright and point dim at various times. An A-26 fighter aircraft intercepted points of possible interest but no visual contact was made. Contact was made at 1930 the midnite began to diminish and after about two (2) hours had disappeared from the scopes.

The following wind conditions prevailed over Oak Ridge at 1600, 29 November 1950:

November 1950:

The following temperatures were recorded at 1700 on 19

Surf.00                 89 deg.
500 ft.                 86 deg.
1000 ft.                87 deg.

At 1800, 20 November 1950 a graph record of a background counter (Geiger counter used to determine radio activity) located in the Control (room) in 10-1501, a portable trailer, was examined and a slight rise in Geiger readings was noted at the edge time. These readings are unaccounted for at the present time. Atomic energy commission officials state that no unusual values of radioactivity particles was made from their installations on -19 or 20 November 1950.

On 20 November 1950, Mr. W. H. Gray, Special Agent, CIC, and Mr. William H. Price, -2041, 10 1/2 were present at the AF radar station when a single, unidentified object appeared on the radar scopes. Following is the controllers notes of the objects progress:

Time            Range (miles)    Azimuth
1251                1               517 deg.
1254               17               310
1406               15               200
1402               14               295
1403               13               290
1408               12               288
(Object disappeared from the scope at 1408.)

At approximately 1620, 20 November 1950, painter, two mechanics to count, on the front porch of the radar scope. These points followed a pattern similar to those of the 20th. These objects remained visible on the radar scopes until 2400 or 1.a.m. 20 November 1950. Present at these observations, in addition to the radar crew, were the following personnel:

UNUSUAL RADAR RETURNS IN THE OAK RIDGE AREA
UNCLASSIFIED

BACKGROUND

On the night of 29 and 30 November between the hours of 1700 and 2300 there were unusual returns or targets reported by the radar station at the McGee-Tyson Airport at Knoxville, Tennessee. This is the only radar station in the area and is charged with the coverage of the Oak Ridge Reservation. The only equipment operating on these nights was a CPS-1. These targets caused considerable alarm to the personnel charged with the security of the Oak Ridge plants and in particular to the personnel of the Air Force NEPA project. The weather on both nights was clear and cold with light surface winds. An interceptor aircraft was dispatched over the Oak Ridge Area but failed to intercept any targets. The aircraft radar picked up no targets. Alerted ground observers on the Oak Ridge Reservation neither sighted nor heard anything.

There were conflicting versions of the mysterious targets as observed on the radar scopes. The two main versions were:

1. A few individual sharp targets appeared on the scope around sundown in the sector from 60° through north to approximately 250°. The targets in the northern sector increased in number and appeared to move south through a gap between two well defined permanent echoes (ridge peaks) located north and north-west of the Oak Ridge Reservation. As these targets moved south over the reservation they fanned out and increased in number until they completely blanketed out or covered the scope over the Oak Ridge Reservation. The apparent target speed was 6 to 8 mph. The targets disappeared around 2300.

2. A very few widely scattered targets appeared around sundown in the north and west quadrants. A more noticeable one larger than the others appeared in the northwest corner of the Oak Ridge Reservation. Numerous targets appeared "boil" out of this one and spread over the entire reservation completely saturating the scope in this area. This mass of targets spread slowly to the south and southwest and disappeared around 2600. All targets disappeared around 2500.

DISCUSSION

Assuming no connections with previous reports of visual sightings, the hill and radar returns which were proven to be flight of ducks, a solution is presented that the unusual radar returns of the nights of 29 and 30 November were due to beam "trapping" or "ducting" caused by the meteorological situation.

Both nights were clear and cold with maximum ground cooling to be expected. The Weather Bureau Station at Oak Ridge has low level temperature records up to 1500 ft (Threescore) for a period of approximately one year. The records indicate that on similar nights the inversion starts at the ground at sundown and reach a depth of 500-600 feet during the night. There are no records for the nights of 29 and 30 November. Such ground inversion are ideal for ducting which has the effect of increasing the number and intensity of permanent echoes and extending the ground clutter.

There are still the following questions to be answered in order to differentiate these unusual sightings from others at different radar locations on similar nights:

1. What are the "echoes" and why are they so sharp in outline?

2. Why do they appear at sundown and disappear around 2300 local time?

3. Why do they have a movement of 6 to 8 mph?

4. Why are they concentrated in the Oak Ridge sector of the scope and not in all sectors?

Suggested Answers:

1. The targets are thought to be high tension power lines, water towers, smoke stacks and similar objects which will give a sharp outline.

2. The radiative cooling starts at sundown and after a very shallow inversion is formed the beam is bent or refracted just enough to bring in the distant ground target and as the inversion continues the beam is further bent so that the number of targets increase in a direction closer and closer to the station and at the optimum beam bending point the return becomes so numerous that it appears as a complete blank of the scope and at this point we might say the ground clutter area has been extended up to the "Naughty-8" area. After 2300 inversion has been deep enough (400-500 ft) so that the bending of the beam will be such that it will again pick up only distant targets.

3. It is proposed that the reported movement is only an apparent movement caused by different targets being picked up successively, relatively slow revolutions of the radar antenna. This would also explain the erratic directions and speed of movement of the targets.

4. There are various versions of where the targets first appeared, their movement and area of disappearance. It is impossible to dismiss any of the versions as each version is from personnel who actually observed the scope. Only good scope photographs can give the true story.

A study of the general surrounding topographical features and the radar scope picture shows that the strong "permanent echoes" (mountain ranges) running in a continuous line from approximately 60° to 340° would prevent any ground targets being detected in the sector from 60° through south to 240°. Therefore, only ground targets in the sector from 60° through north to 240° could be expected to be picked up during these strong ground inversions or "ducting" conditions.

A more detailed study of the surrounding topographical features reveal the following:

1) The city of Knoxville is located in the sector of 0-30° from the radar station. The heat from the city would tend to counteract the ground cooling and lessen the chances of ground "ducting" in this direction.

2) The region adjacent to the radar site in the sector 270-0 (Oak Ridge Sector) contains the Fort Loudon Reservoir. This sector within a five-mile radius of the radar site is approximately 50% covered by the lake. An important parameter in the change of time cold surface curve with height and time is the change in moisture content. Considerable moisture is transported from the lake surface to the very low layers of the adjacent air during cold nights (steam fog conditions) and it is probable that this effect greatly modifies the low level radar transmission characteristics in this sector during clear, cold nights. Detailed atmospheric soundings adjacent to and over the lake were not required to determine the magnitude of this effect.

CONCLUSIONS:

1. The unusual radar returns in question are attributed to the atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time of observation.

RECOMMENDATION:

1. Continuous scope photographs should be taken during unusual radar return conditions.

2. Low level atmospheric soundings should be taken at 30 minute intervals by the Oak Ridge Weather Bureau Station during these unusual radar return conditions.

3. Airborne sampling runs should be made adjacent to and through
the top of the inversion layer (approximately 300 feet at
2800 local time).

4. An L-Band search radar (TPS-1) should be obtained and used in
conjunction with the present S-Band set. Test runs have shown
that there is very little correlation with time between targets
placed up during ducting conditions on the two frequency bands.
Therefore, a comparison of the returns from the two radars will
give an indication of whether the targets are due to "ducting."

5. If possible, [redacted] and the Weather Bureau personnel
at Oak Ridge should be brought to work on the problem on a
cooperative basis.

UNCLASSIFIED

This information is forwarded in accordance with agreement made in telephone conversation between Col Endresiss and Col Funn on 8 Dec 50.

Personnel representing AMC Intelligence Dept and Electronics Sub-Division visited Oak Ridge on 5 and 6 Dec. Matter was discussed with Major Steele, Major Carre, and Mr. Kurts, NEPA project, together with representatives of OSI and CIC in that district.

Matter was also discussed with Major Care and Capt [illegible] at Radar station, Knoxville, airport. The investigators concluded that the targets which reportedly "blacked-out" the North East sector of the radar scope" were caused by ground targets which became visible due to "anomalous propagation" or bending downward of the radar beams. Bending of radar beams is caused by non-uniformity of the atmosphere in either density or moisture content. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as "temperature inversion" or "duct" effect. The theory of how this effect occurs is too lengthy for further discussion here.

Important characteristics of the reported radar targets, as stated by the radar operations officer, Capt [illegible] are given below:

1. First target appeared in the northeast corner of the restricted area.
2. Additional targets appeared in the same general area and spread south and east.
3. All targets appeared in a sector between approximately 260 and 350 degrees and between the ranges of 12 and 25 miles.
4. Targets first appeared at about 1:45 and were seen until 2330 on 29 Nov 50.

5. Targets of the same nature as those observed on the 29th appeared on the 30th of November 1950 between the hours of about 1630 - 2353.

6. Permanent echoes, said to be a railroad track, in the area of the unknown echoes were much more distinct during the period of observance of unknown targets.

7. Ground clutter extended on the radar scope out to about 12 miles in the direction of Oak Ridge, and high mountains, 3 to 4 miles outside of the restricted area to the northeast were visible on the radar screen.

8. Unknown targets first appeared on the lower radar beam and as they moved southward they were picked up by the upper beam.

9. Wind was from the southwest during the period of the observation of unknown targets.

10. Targets were reported to be moving at a rate of 6 to 8 miles per hour. (It is the investigators' belief that the targets were so numerous that actual movement of a specific echo would be very hard to ascertain. Movement could be mistaken by the appearance of new signal echoes as the affected area spread.)

11. Targets beyond the so-called "blacked-out area" were detected during the period or reception of unknown target echoes.

12. Intercept aircraft were unable to intercept any of the unknown targets, neither did any of these targets appear on the airborne radar set.

The ground radar set, an AN/CPS-1 early warning radar, operates at a frequency of about 3000 megacycles per record, and, like all microwave electronic equipment,
