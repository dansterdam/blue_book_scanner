ASTRONOMY
SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for February 21, 1959

Venus Becomes Prominent
Mercury is also visible for a few days near March 12, when the most favorable greatest eastern elongation for 1959 occurs. Partial lunar eclipse will be seen on March 24.

By JAMES STOKLEY

VENUS, shining brilliantly low in the western sky for a few hours after sunset, is the most conspicuous object in the evening skies during March, except for the moon.

Another planet, Mercury, will appear for a few days around March 12. It will be seen low in the western sky just after sunset. Neither Venus nor Mercury is shown on the accompanying maps, since they are drawn for a later hour: 10:00 p.m., your own local standard time, at the beginning of March; 9:30 p.m. at midsummer and 8:30 p.m. at the end of March.

Although Mercury, when it comes into view, will be only about 1/25th as bright as Venus, it will be visible as the first magnitude star.

A third planet, Mars, is also visible in March, and does appear on the maps. It is high in the west, in the constellation Aquarius, the water bearer, still bright enough to rank in the first magnitude stars.

Mars and the other planets have no light of their own. They shine by reflected sunlight. Their distances are numbered in millions of miles, each star is a sun, shining with its own light.

The brightest star now visible in the evening is Sirius, the dog star. It is located in the southwest, in Canis Major, the great dog constellation. Sirius is the brightest and smallest, dog. Canis Minor. In this group shines the star called Procyon. Still higher are the twins, Gemini, with Castor and Pollux. The later is a first magnitude star of the first constellation known as Gemini.

To the right of Sirius and a little higher in the magnificent constellation known as Orion, the hunters. This bears two stars of the first magnitude: Betelgeuse, above, and Rigel, below. Between them are three stars that form Orion's belt, a distinctive feature of Orion that helps in identifying the constellation.

Further to the right is Taurus, already mentioned as the location of Mars, and containing the Pleiades. Look for the right of Taurus (down on the northern sky map) to Auriga, the charioteer, and brilliant Capella.

In ancient Greece, when Venus was visible in the evening sky as it is now, it was called Hesperus. When it was seen in the morning hours, before sunrise, it was last summer and fall, it was called Phosphorus. The early Greeks did not know these were the same planet, seeing one side of the sun to the other, and thus was visible alternately as an evening, and as a morning, star.

Actually, Venus moves around the sun (the earth's distance is 93,000,000 miles), and takes 225 days for one revolution. Every 584 days it catches up and comes approximately between the earth and sun. This position is called inferior conjunction.

Venus Lost in Solar Glare

Once in each revolution it is invisible for about two weeks, at superior conjunction. This happened last Nov. 11.

At either conjunction Venus is in line with the sun, and not visible, since it is lost in the solar glare. After superior conjunction Venus will be seen on the east side of the sun, and follows that body in its daily motion across the sky.

As Venus get further and further away from the sun's direction, it remains visible longer and longer after sunset, thus becoming prominent in the evening sky, as it is now. The "greatest elongation" on the east of the sun will come on June 23, when Venus will shine in the west for more than two and a half hours after sunset.

DIE FIELDS
SURGERY
Atomic Beam Performs
Brain Beam Surgery on Human
> NIH, FIRST known brain operation with
a proton beam, instead of surgical instruments, has been carried out at the Gustav
Werner Institute for Nuclear Chemistry in
Upton, Sweden.

The operation was performed on a man suffering from acute pain and depression.

The beam of protons passes through the
cranium and the intervening tissue without
affecting them. It is concentrated sharply on
the exact part of the brain, in this case less
than half a cubic centimeter, to be destroyed.
The operation took about two hours. The
patient was conscious the whole time. Anesthesia was not necessary as the operation
was painless. He lay on an operating table
placed inside a drum, his head held in position by clamps. The table was rotated after
each radiation so that the beam struck the
operation site from different angles.

The operating table was placed about 50
feet from the synchro-cyclotron and separated from it by a wall. The beam was about
six feet thick. The beam was led from the
synchro-cyclotron through a 60-foot long
tube that passed through a small hole in the
surface wall.

Those on the operation team were Profs.
Lars Leksell and Rune Rocard, and Drs.
Mats Larsson, Sven Johansson, Nils Larsson and W. G. P. Maile.

Dr. Maile, an American radiologist, is now
working at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases in London. He had been doing
research at Upton for the past year.

The team pointed out that the idea of
using a proton beam instead of surgical
instruments originated at the University of
California in Berkeley. There, Prof. Cornelius A. Tobias has used it for pituitary gland
operations.

Note: (Feb. 7).

The exact chemical nature of the hormone is still unknown, although scientists
have defined highly purified samples from
insects. It is a stable, water-insoluble molecule that holds up to the general class of
lipids or fats.

When the juvenile hormone is present
in high concentration in insects, it blocks
the formation of the pupa from the caterpillar, or the adult form the pupa. It acts
to hold the insect in the larval or pupal
stage, and permits it to grow in this stage.
It is for this reason the hormone has
been labeled the "status quo hormone."

In view of the extraordinary biological
activity of this hormone, its role in the
metamorphosis and aging of insects, it
seems important to decide whether the
juvenile hormone may play a role in mammalian physiology or whether its presence
is merely a curiosity, according to "pure
chemical curiosity," Dr. Williams said.

The work was supported in part by the
U. S. Public Health Service.

MEDICINE

Foresee Early Diagnosis
For Multiple Sclerosis
> EARLY DIAGNOSIS of multiple sclerosis, long known to be a frustrating and intricate process, will soon be an accurate procedure, Dr. Leroy F. Burney predicted at the recent meeting of the Multiple Sclerosis Society conference in New York.

Diagnosis of this crippler that now affects more than 500,000 Americans has been difficult. Until recently the time lapse between onset of the disease and diagnosis was about six years, the Surgeon General of the U. S. Public Health Service said.

Now early diagnosis is a distinct possibility through the use of new techniques, one of which measures the constituents of the cerebrospinal fluid.

Further details showed that the carbohydrates associated with gamma globulin are increased in the spinal fluid of MS patients, whereas certain other constituents are increased in other conditions such as brain tumor.

Furthermore, Dr. Burney said, epidemiological studies of MS have yielded additional information concerning the crippler.

It is much more prevalent in colder climates. Incidence of MS is six times higher in Winnipeg, Canada, than in New Orleans,
Louisiana. The report suggests a possible
higher prevalence in northern zones. It
offers young adults, usually between the
ages of 20 and 30, it affects both sexes.

Another mystery yet unsolved is the exact cause of multiple sclerosis. At present, the most popular theory has been that a virus, a spider, or bacteria might be the culprit. At other times, dietary deficiencies, hormonal influences, or a causal relationship. Allergic response, metabolic defect, vascular disturbances in the brain and spinal cord have all been suggested.

BIOLOGY

Insect Juvenile Hormone
Found in Mammals, Man
> THE "JUVENILE" HORMONE that
helps control growth and aging in insects
has been found in mammals, including
man, according to a report by an endocrinologist.

Dr. Karl W. Williams, a Harvard University
biologist, said. The most active extracts
of the hormone were prepared from the
lower neck tissue of animals and in man
at the present time there is no information as to whether the juvenile hormone
is also acting as a hormone in humans or
other higher animals. The scientist noted,
after biological studies with Dr. Lynn U. Moorhead and Miss Jean F. Dalis,

VIROLOGY

Garter Snake Can Harbor
Sleeping Sickness Virus
> THE GARTER SNAKE may be the salt
point in keeping one kind of sleeping sickness virus alive in nature, scientists have
recently discovered. Experiments conclusively established that during the winter, sleeping encephalomyelitis is spread through a mosquito-bird
mosquito cycle. However, an acceptable explanation for how the virus was maintained
during the winter, migrating birds studied
failed to show the virus in their blood.

Now, three U. S. Public Health Service
scientists have found, there is evidence that
the hibernating garter snake plays a role in
overwintering of the virus.

Tests showed that when the garter snake
was removed, the virus spent the winter
within the snake. Laboratory tests proved
that the mosquito did feed on the snake. In
snakes, one susceptible to the virus.

This is the first evidence, the scientists
said, that a vertebrate animal can harbor a
virus which is an important parasite of
man and mammals. The virus is a cold
blooded vertebrate.

Virus was detected in very high dilutions
of whole blood and serum taken from the
virus reservoir in the blood for a long time.
The work was done by William A. Jellison,
William A. Rudd, all of the National Institute of Allergy, Rocky Mountain Laboratory,
Hamilton, Mont., and the research reported
in the Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

AERONAUTICS

XW-3 Flies Like Airplane,
Takes Off Like Helicopter
> AN AIRCRAFT built to take off like
a helicopter, then fly like an airplane has
been developed by Bell Helicopter Corporation.

The new Bell Helicopter Corporation's XW-3 combines and vertical flight capabilities of the
helicopter with the relatively high cruising
speed and long range performance of the
airplane, achieved 1957, in flight converted
from a helicopter to an airplane configuration about 132 miles per hour.

Maximum speed of the XW-3 is estimated at about 175 miles per hour but it is
engineers said further tests would be
needed.

The aircraft has two roadable configurations mounted near the tips of a relatively small
wing. Each rotor axis is the forward
rotor. During the conversion process, power
is transferred from the rotor drive system
in 15 seconds, the lift load is transferred from
the rotors to the wing.

The XW-3 is being developed for the
U. S. Army and other potential military
uses.

Here is the text from the document:

After that it will close in rapture, we bring inside more comments.
1. During the fall and winter Venus will be in the morning sky again, until it reaches superior conjunction on June 25, 1960. By the autumn of next year, Venus will once more be shining in the evening sky.

Mercury goes through a similar, but accelerated, cycle, and it likewise had two times in ancient times. It was called the morning star and the evening star in the morning. This planet's mean distance from the sun is only 36,000,000 miles and it goes around once in 88 days. The Synodic period, in which it catches up to earth, is 116 days or four times each year it may come into the evening sky, when it reaches greatest elongation.

March Brings Mercury

As far as seeing Mercury is concerned, the best such elongation is one that occurs near the beginning of spring, so the one this year, March 13, is the most favorable of the year. The next one July 8, is fairly good, but the next after that, Nov. 3, is quite unlovable.

March brings a partial eclipse of the moon, during which the moon enters partly into the shadow of the earth. This occurs on March 24, but during daylight hours in North America, so it will not be visible here. A full eclipse will occur most of the night in the Eastern Hemisphere, as well as Antarctica.

About one-quarter of the moon's diameter will be shaded during the partial eclipse.

On Saturday, March 21, at 3:55 a.m., EST, the sun, which has been moving northward in the sky since Dec. 22, will be directly over the equator at a point in the Indian Ocean, off the east of Sumatra. This is the equinox, which marks the beginning of spring in northern countries, and of fall in those of the Southern Hemisphere.

WASHINGTON, MARCH 17---(UPI)---THE NAVY SAID TODAY THAT A WEATHER BALLOON LAUNCHED FROM MINNESOTA FRIDAY HIT A HIGH-SPEED JET AIR STREAM AND IS BELIEVED TO HAVE TRAVELED ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY AROUND THE WORLD.

AN AUTOMATIC TIMING DEVICE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE CAUSED THE BALLOON'S 12-POUND LOAD OF INSTRUMENTS TO DROP THIS MORNING. IF THE BALLOON'S COURSE AND SPEED HAD BEEN CHANGED, THIS WOULD HAVE OCCURRED OVER NORTHEAST ASIA.

THE BALLOON WAS SENT ALOFT FROM STANTON, MINN., AT 1220 A.M. EST FRIDAY. IT WAS NOT EXPECTED TO SOAR BEYOND THE UNITED STATES, BUT IT DRIFTED INTO THE UPPER AIR STREAM AND BY 6:50 A.M. THE NEXT DAY SPEEDING EASTWARD AT MORE THAN 100 MILES AN HOUR AT A HEIGHT OF 34,000 FEET.

THE FLIGHT WAS DESIGNED TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW TYPE PLASTIC BALLOON, SEALED AND WITHOUT BALLAST. THE INSTRUMENTS TRANSMITTED PRESSURE, ALTITUDE AND POSITION DATA UNTIL RADIO CONTACT WAS LOST.

Balloon released from Stanton, Minn. at 1220 A.M. EST Friday, 13 March 1959. It was not expected to soar beyond the United States, but it drifted into the upper air stream and by 6:50 A.M. the next day was speeding eastward at more than 100 miles an hour at a height of 34,000 feet. The flight was designed to test the feasibility of a new type of plastic balloon sealed and without ballast. The instruments transmitted pressure, altitude and position data until radio contact was lost.
