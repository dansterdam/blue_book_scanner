The Air Force was contacted and the above information was received from Mr. [redacted] during an interview. Trooper Roberts and Mr. [redacted] were contacted, and during individual interviews, disclosed that the story told them by Mr. [redacted] was identical with that given to investigators.

A ground search and one hour aerial reconnaissance of the area concerned was conducted by the Air Force on 23 February and 24 February 1958, with negative results. Other government agencies were contacted for possible falling aircraft, aircraft parts, etc. with similar results.

Mr. [redacted] reported he also searched the area on 22 and 23 February 1958 and discovered a hole in the ice of a small pond. An investigation of this failed to disclose such an object as had been reported in the pond.

3. Near Mc Stally, Mo.

Insufficient evidence of the interview
search made to locate the object source
said he saw falls.

Lack of object or conclusive evidence.

Inconclusive & unreliable evidence
- long gonna cut surface was during 2 sec.
- source is slithering 2 sec. but the
of meter from this savage scene at
around the bank (site listening)

That is "uncertain" because nothing
can be found around & not the
slightest clue. Corroborate.

11. Comments - OIC, Mission Support Section, Operational Intelligence, 2/Lt Earl H. McCauley

In light of Mr. [redacted] credibility as a witness, his account appears to be quite plausible. Although a ground and aerial search revealed nothing this office feels that Mr. [redacted] is valid. The object will be discovered by the local farmers, who have been alerted, when they begin their spring work in the fields.

EARL H. McCAULEY
2/Lt, USAF
OIC, Mission Support Section

Investigation of the afore mentioned sighting was as follows:

Contact was made with Mr. [redacted], civilian, who reported having seen a bullet shaped object falling approximately 1-5 miles North West of where he was leaning brush on his fathers farm. His description was that a light in the sky (height unknown) caused him to observe an object for about two (2) seconds. He believed the object at first to be a meteor but as it came closer, it resembled an airplane without wings. He heard no sound. The object was traveling on a South East to North West heading and fell rapidly at an angle of about fifty (50) degrees. The object was an estimated 20 feet in length and 4-5 feet in diameter, trailing smoke and flame. The flame being red in color. Suddenly there was a larger puff of white smoke and a piece of the object 1/3 of the length (estimated size of the piece which became detached was one-fifth the size of the main object). After the puff of smoke which he believed to be an explosion, the object dropped straight to the ground. It did not appear to oscillate or tumble.

The object was silver in color, reflecting the sun light and believed possibly to be rotating. Mr. [redacted] immediately ran one-fourth mile to his car and drove to the area in which he believed the object to have landed, but was unable to locate anything. He inquired of neighbors in the vicinity but reports of any sightings were negative. At 1930 hours (local time) he contacted State Trooper Roberts and a local police officer of the sighting.

Mr. [redacted] and trooper Roberts were both contacted by investigators from this office who reported that they were contacted by [redacted] while cruising in a police car. Buesing was a locally excited [redacted], however not believed acting abnormally. Upon notification of the sighting, [redacted] Trooper Roberts, and upon further search the area in the Police Car, however darkness prevented them from further search.

Trooper Roberts and Mr. [redacted] inquired as to the character of [redacted] from several persons and neighbors who knew him, all reported Mr. [redacted] as reliable and of good character.

Individual interviews with Trooper Roberts, and Mr. [redacted] also told to investigators...

At 4:00 P.M. on 19 February 1958, was clearing brush on his father's farm which is located 18 miles southwest of Marshall, Missouri. At this time, he noticed a moving light in the sky to the southeast of his location, travelling at an angle of about 50 degrees, and was visible for about two seconds. (however away?)

The object was silver in color, bullet shaped and estimated to be 20 feet long, 4 to 5 feet in diameter, trailing red flames and grey smoke.

The smoke dissipated rapidly, leaving no contrail. Mr. at first sighting, thought it was a meteor but as it came closer it resembled an airplane without wings. Suddenly there was a puff of white smoke and a piece of the object became detached. After the puff of smoke, the object fell straight down and did not appear to oscillate or tumble.

Mr. immediately ran to his car, which was parked 1/4 mile away, and drove to the area in which he believed it to land, but was unable to locate anything. He contacted the neighbors in the area but none of them saw anything.

At 7:30 P.M. the same day, he contacted State Trooper Roberts and Mr. who had seen. The three of them immediately toured the area in question in the police car until darkness prevented further search.

Trooper Roberts and Mr. contacted several persons who knew Mr. and inquired as to his character. They all considered him to be reliable and of good character.
