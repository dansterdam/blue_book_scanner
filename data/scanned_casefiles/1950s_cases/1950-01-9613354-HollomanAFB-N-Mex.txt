1. Direction of flight: Observer did not keep object in sight long enough to determine overall movement of the object. When sighted at 0005 on 13 January, the object had moved to the east a small number of degrees beyond the point where it was observed at 2300 the previous evening. (2300-16 Jan 49) Object moved erratically up and down, left and right in its general path of movement from east to west.

2. Tactics or maneuvers: Object traversed a predominately level path; changes in altitude were comparatively minute and erratic.

3. Evidence of exhaust: None

4. Effect on clouds: Although it was extremely cloudy in the west, east and south, there were no clouds to the north. The object was clearly visible in the north and had no effect on the clouds that were in the sky.

m. Lights: Object itself was a light.
n. Support: None visible.
o. Propulsion: Unable to determine.
p. Control and stability: Apparently poor.
q. Air ducts: Unable to determine. 
r. Speed: Unable to determine.
s. Sound: None
t. Manner of disappearance: Object disappeared 0005, 13 January, due to the on-coming daylight.

u. Notes relative to observer:
(1) Name: 3024th Air Police Squadron, Holloman AFB.

(5) Pertinent hobbies: None
(6) Ability to determine: Average
(7) Reliability of observer: Reliable.
(8) Former sightings: Observer saw a like object on 6 January 1950, which object was reported by this agent, and also on the evening of the previous day, 12 January 1950.
(9) Witnesses: 
        Air Provost Marshal's Office, Holloman AFB.
        Air Provost Marshal's Office, Holloman AFB.
This agent was unable to make a definite attempt to get a definite fix on the object, due to the fact that it was not reported until after the sighting. Checks were made with the Base Weather Squadron, the Operations and Projects Sections, Holloman AFB, and the Research Branch at White Sands Proving Ground, and it was determined that no testing devices had been released which would account for the sighting.
