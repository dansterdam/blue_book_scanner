1. Direction of flight: Observer did not keep object in sight long enough to determine overall movement of the object. When sighted at 0805 on 13 January, the object had moved to the east a small number of degrees beyond the point where it was observed at 1900 the previous evening, (24-8)=16. Object moved erratically up, down, to the right, and to the left in its general path of movement from east to west.

3. Tactics or maneuvers: Object traversed a predominantly level path, changes in altitude were comparatively minute and erratic.

4. Evidence of exhaust: None

1. Effect on clouds: Although it was extremely cloudy in the west, east and south, there were no clouds to the north. The object was clearly visible in the north and had no effect on the clouds that were in the sky.

m. Lights: Object itself was a light.

n. Support: None visible.

o. Propulsion: Unable to determine.

p. Control and stability: Apparently poor.

5. This agent was unable to make an attempt to get a definite "fix" on the object due to the fact that it was not reported until after it had disappeared. There was no radar in operation at the time of the sighting. Checks were made with the Base Weather Squadron, the Operations and Projects Section, Holloman AFB, and the Research Branch. In the Sands Proving Ground, and it was determined that no testing devices had been released which would account for the sighting.
