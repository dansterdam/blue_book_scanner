10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
B-47 crew sighted a small object somewhat similar to a star, while flying at 35,000 feet. Object was on an unvarying heading of about 170 dgrs. Did not appear to gain or lose altitude.

Time, appearance, bearings etc., indicate that the object was Sputnik - the Soviet satellite. Check with orbital tracks and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory confirmed this assumption.

12. CONCLUSIONS

FOLLOWING IS A REPORT OF 44001 75504 SECTION I OF-II SUBJECT "UFOB"
CREWS OF THE 40 BOMWG/

1.) DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT
(A) OBJECT APPEARED TO RESEMBLE A STAR FROM THE DISTANCE
INVOLVED SN THE OBSERVATION.
(B) IN SIZE OBJECT APPEARED COMPARABLE TO A PEA HELD AT ARMS
LENGTH. IT APPEARED 3/4 THE SIZE OF PROCYON.
(C) OBJECT WAS COLORLESS; GAVE OFF LIGHT COMPARABLE TO THAT

2.) DESCRIPTION OF COURSE OF OBJECT
(A) CREWS ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO OBJECT BY ITS BRIGHTNESS
AND ITS SPEED, AND BY THEIR INVESTIGATION AT THAT TIME FOR
A CELESTIAL BODY SUITABLE AS AN AID TO NAVIGATION.
(B) (C) OBJECT CROSSED THE TRACK OF BOTH AIRCRAFT WHILE THEY
WERE MAKING GOOD A COURSE OF 230 DEGREES AT AN ALTITUDE
OF 35,000 FEET. THE ANGLE OF ELEVATION OF THE OBJECT WHEN
FIRST AND LAST OBSERVED WAS APPROXIMATELY 50 DEGREES. IT
WAS DETERMINED THAT THE OBJECT WAS DESCENDING A COURSE
FROM 310 DEGREES TO 170 DEGREES, AT AN UNDETERMINED
ALTITUDE TRACK DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF CLOCK POSITION WAS
FROM 2330 O'CLOCK TO 1020).
(D) NO MANEUVERS WERE NOTED. OBJECT MAINTAINED AN UNVARYING
HEADING OF 170 DEGREES, AND DID NOT APPEAR TO GAIN OR
LOSE ALTITUDE.

PAGE THREE RJWFSY 67
(E) OBJECT MAINTAINED ITS BRIGHTNESS UNTIL IT PASSED OUT OF
THE RANGE OF VISION OF THE OBSERVERS. IT DID NOT GO "OUT"
NOR DID IT GO "OUT" ALL AT ONCE.
(F) OBJECT WAS OBSERVED CONSTANTLY FOR FOUR MINUTES.

3.) MANNER OF OBSERVATION
(A) AIR-VISUAL
(B) NO OPTICAL AIDS WERE USED
(C) B-47, ACFT NO 542, 35000 FEET, 230 DEGREES, 425 KNOTS,
SCHILLING AFB, KANSAS.
B-47, ACFT NO 566, 35000 FEET, 230 DEGREES, 425 KNOTS,
SCHILLING AFB, KANSAS.

4.) TIME AND DATE OF SIGHTING
(A) 10/10/57 - 10/10347
(B) DAWN CONDITIONS PREVAILED. OBSERVERS STATED THAT IT WAS
LIGHT ENOUGH TO MAKE MOST STARS INVISIBLE. ONLY PROCYON
AND JUPITER WERE VISIBLE, ALONG WITH THE UFOB.

5.) LOCATION OF OBSERVERS
(A) OBSERVERS MADE OBSERVATION WHILE FLYING AN 8 AF DIRECTED
MISSION. THEIR POSITION WAS 4/3626N- 70/3705N,
APPROXIMATELY 20NM SOUTH OF PORTLAND, MAINE.

6.) IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF ALL OBSERVERS:
(A) N/A

(B) 1. IRVING, JOHN C. MAJOR, USAF, 40BW, SAC,
AIRCRAFT COMMANDER, RATED EXTREMELY RELIABLE, MAJOR
IRVINGS EXPERIENCE AND PROFESSIONAL SKILL ARE
ATTESTED TO BY HIS POSITION OF STANDBOARD AIRCRAFT
COMMANDER OF THIS ORGANIZATION.

2. MEAD FRANK F. III, CAPTAIN, USAF, 40BW, (SAC),
CO-PILOT, RATED EXTREMELY RELIABLE. CAPTAIN MEAD
IS CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO MAJOR IRVINGS CREW, AND
HAS DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF IN HIS POSITION OF
WING STANDBOARD PILOT. FAMILIARITY WITH CELESTIAL
BODIES IS ESSENTIAL TO HIS DUTY AS ASSISTANT NAVIGATOR
WHICH INVOLVES POSITIONING THE AIRCRAFT BY CELESTIAL
NAVIGATION TECHNIQUES. CAPTAIN MEAD IS POSITIVE THAT
OBSERVED OBJECT WAS NOT A METEOR OR SHOOTING STAR.

2. BRETZIUS, WILLIAM F. III, CAPTAIN USAF, 40BW, (SAC)
AIRCRAFT COMMANDER, RATED EXTREMELY RELIABLE. CAPTAIN
BRETZIUS IS A REGULAR OFFICER IN THE USAF, WITH
CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN B-47 TYPE AIRCRAFT. HIS
CONSERVATIVE MANNER AND PROFESSIONAL SKILL RECOMMEND
HIS CORROBORATING TESTIMONY. IN ALL CASES FATIGUE

7.) HAS BEEN ELIMINATED AS A FACTOR TO BE CONSIDERED.

WEATHER CONDITIONS:
AIRPLANE WERE FLYING AT 35000 FEET. SLIGHT OVERCAST
WAS OBSERVED TO AN ALTITUDE OF 20000 FEET. VISIBILITY
ALONG THE FLIGHT PATH WAS UNLIMITED HOWEVER, THERE
WAS OBSERVED A THIN LAYER OF CIRRUS CLOUDS TO THE
RIGHT OF THE TRACK & EXTENDING TO 40000 FEET AND A
CUMULUS BUILD-UP TO THE LEFT AT A DISTANCE APPROXIMATELY
120 NM. OBSERVERS STATE THAT VISIBILITY OF OBJECT AT
ITS EXTREME ALTITUDE WAS UNIMPAIRED BY WEATHER
CONDITIONS.

11.) COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
CAPTAIN THOMAS B. BOUDRE, 428W INTELLIGENCE OFFICER,
PREPARING OFFICER EMPHASIZES EXTREME RELIABILITY OF
WITNESSES, AND HAS RULED OUT, IN PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATION, THE POSSIBILITY OF FATIGUE AS A
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. INVESTIGATION HAS FURTHER
ASCERTAINED THAT OBJECT WAS OBSERVED NOT AS THE DIRECT
RESULT OF UNUSUAL METEORLOGICAL PHENOMENA. THE EXPERIENCE
OF ALL OBSERVERS INVOLVED INDICATES THEIR CAPABILITY TO
DETERMINE UNUSUAL ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA. THE POSSIBILITY OF
OBSERVERS MISTAKING METEOR OR SHOOTING STARS FOR OBJECT WAS
INVESTIGATED AND IN ALL CASES WAS REFUSED BY OBSERVERS: NO
TAIL, TRAIL OR EXHAUST WERE OBSERVED. OBSERVERS DECLARE IN
ALL CASES THAT EXTREME ALTITUDE OF OBJECT, PLUS UNDIVERGED
COURSE MAKE THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS BEING A MANNED AIRCRAFT
ALTOGETHER REMOTE. ALTHOUGH ALMOST TOO CONVENIENT, OBSERVERS
AND DEBRIEIFNG OFFICER AGREE THAT MOST LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS
THAT OBJECT WAS A SATELLITE IN ORBIT.
