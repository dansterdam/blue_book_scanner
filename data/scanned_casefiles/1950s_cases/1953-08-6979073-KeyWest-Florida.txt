AF FORM 112--PART I 
UNITED STATES 
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: FLYCRAFT 
AREA REPORTED ON: East Florida - Key West. 
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 3 July and 4 August 1953 
DATE OF REPORT: 5 August 1953
REPORTING AGENCY: Lt. DONALD J. MORLEY, Student Apprentice 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Lt. Col. THOMAS J. MURPHY, USAF
SUMMARY: (Give concise summary of report. Use supplementary paragraphs. Last paragraph is a cover lett)
On 3 July and 4 August 1953, student Apprentice Charles S. Forester, a student at the U.S. Navy Pre-Flight School, Key West, Florida, observed two unidentified flying objects on 3 July at approximately 2300 EST and the second was at 2135 EST. The objects appeared to be about 50 to 100 feet in diameter and proceeded rapidly from the western horizon to the eastern horizon and disappeared. No mechanical characteristics were noted. The objects exhibited no navigation or clearance lights and no sound. The observation was made from the ground. No mechanical characteristics were noted. The objects proceeded rapidly from one horizon to the other and disappeared. The observer does not appear to be unfamiliar and his observation was apparently made in a straightforward manner. The observer does not appear to be unusually imaginative or subject to flights of fancy as far as this report is concerned.
This office has no comments upon the reports other than to note that the observer's description lacks certain details that might be expected from a more experienced or technically trained observer.

AF FORM 112—PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
the interview continued and he was conversing more easily at the end. It is no longer said that the sighting was "dull" near the beginning. He stated again the impression that he wants to be very exact in his answers and give definite dates for all events. He stated he would not trust his memory at all where exact figures or dates are concerned, nor would he recall at officer's home, collect. In the event he made another sighting.
Weather and winds shift conditions at time and places of sightings were as follows:
24 July
observer reported overcast and hazy conditions, visibility reduced to 5-10 miles. a strong easterly wind estimated at velocity of 20 to 25 knots was blowing. Later in the evening, the weather was reported clear to partly cloudy with visibility of 10 to 15 miles. Winds had diminished to 10-15 knots from the east.
3 August
Observer reported a hazy overcast with good visibility of 15 to 20 miles. Winds aloft were from the east at 20-25 knots. The surface winds were calm or near calm.
No official interrogation or identification action was taken.
All Air Force control tower records revealed no air traffic in the general area at the times sightings were reported.
No confirmation, no further information, and no explanation for the sightings are presented in this report. DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS: DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

PAGE: 3 OF 4 PAGES

On 21 July 1953 the witness reported the following:

The observer stated that on 21 July 1953 he was accompanied by his wife and another couple on a picnic at Key West. At approximately 2:30 PM EST, they observed three unusual objects in the sky. The objects were described as round, white, and hazy in appearance. They were located northeast of the observer's position and were moving in a straight line at approximately the same speed. The observer estimated the speed to be around 600 to 800 mph and the altitude to be approximately 20,000 to 25,000 feet.

The objects were observed for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. The observer's wife called his attention to the objects. When he first saw them they were already under observation by the other couple. The objects disappeared from sight going off in a northeasterly direction. The observer stated he did not know the exact distance or height of the objects, as he had no means of determining this. He did not hear any sound associated with the objects.

The observer stated that he is a retired military officer and is familiar with various aircraft. He said the objects were unlike any aircraft he had previously observed. He further stated that they moved at a speed much greater than any known aircraft. In his opinion, the objects were unidentified.

The Air Force investigator stated that the observer appeared to be reliable and that his report was made in good faith. Further, the investigator stated that the observer's description of the objects corresponds generally with other unidentified sightings reported in the Key West area around that time. The investigator did not feel that the observer had misidentified a conventional aircraft.

The image contains a chart that appears to be a World Aeronautical Chart. The chart shows a plot of the "Point of Disappearance" and "Point of Appearance" of an unidentified object on August 1, 1953. The chart includes a vertical flight path and a lateral flight path, as well as details about the observation point, the exact distance being unknown, and the flight path being enlarged for clarity.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

The image contains a document titled "UNCLASSIFIED" which appears to be a report from Project Blue Book, specifically related to a UFO sighting that occurred on 24 July 1953 in Key West, Florida.

The text in the document is as follows:

Between the hours of 2300 and 2330 EST, a student at the Fleet Sonar School United States Navy, Key West, Florida, observed a bright object in the sky over Key West. The object appeared to be approximately the size of a pin point or a star, very bright white in color, proceeding from low on the western sky-line to a point directly forward and overhead. The object then blinked out instantaneously before it reached the zenith. The observer described its distance from him as approximately 1000 to 1500 feet. Speed was reported as unknown, since the observer did not know the object's true size or distance from him. The observer stated that the object appeared to move in regular smooth circles.

Inquiry was made as to the observer's general reputation and character. His supervisor in Sonar Operations stated that he had no knowledge of the observer having shown poor judgment, poor maturity, or having exhibited any other peculiarities during his tour of duty. The supervisor described him as a quiet, conscientious, good student - not outstanding but above average. The interviewer adjudged him to be stable, well-adjusted, and very consistent with his answers after the observation.

The weather at the time of the observation was reported as a broken overcast. Clouds were reported to be solid to the west where the object disappeared. A check with CAA office of U.S. Weather Bureau at Boca Chica Key revealed no unusual activity on 22,300 feet.

There were several aircraft in the area and one of them was equipped with a searchlight. There is a possibility that the observer saw the searchlight scanning the area.

Conclusion: Other - probably searchlight or aircraft.

Dear Capt. Harding:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just gotten around to looking over the large batch of accumulated reports. I must say that compared with Black Hawk, none of these accumulated incidents in interest. I'm afraid that none of these is sufficiently interesting to make a writeup profitable.

On the interesting case, the very similar sightings of 24 July and 1 August near Elmendorf, Alaska would appear to warrant more thought.

The 28 July report APS Texas also holds possible interest from the standpoint of maneuvers and the fact they were observed from the Control Tower and by civilians of Harlingen, Texas.

It is too bad there is no more information on Decatur, Ala. These cases cover about four separate days. There is possibly pay dirt in these.

Finally, the Idid Siliman sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably require more information on the background.

As for the remaining 30 or so, there is so little information concerning those which is not purely speculative that there is no percentage whatever in considering them seriously.

Your staff has indicated that nothing further would be available if I visit the Air Force Institute of Technology. Personally, I feel certain that if this case can be explained, others would follow suit. Concurring in the recent Black Hawk case, the investigation proceeded slowly but surely with the investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the evidence. Since the observations covered several hours and daylight was both visual and radar, it is important, in my estimation, that we continue to pursue this matter diligently.

"AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (TDCS-DB-315/00784-53)
TAG IF-23-53   PAGE 3 OF 4 PAGES

1. Report follows of the information obtained by this office in compliance with your request for information on the subject sighting of an unidentified flying object reported to have occurred on 29 July 1953 at Key West, Florida. 

Only one object was sighted on each occasion. It was very bright, white in color but no small that the observer stated he could just barely see it. It was observed to have a circular motion and descent, rising back up at a 45 degree angle. The object's speed was reported as unknown, since the observer did not know the object's true size. The object was observed for approximately one half minute during the sighting on 29 July 1953. No other details were available. Similar observations were said to have been observed on 2 previous occasions. These maneuvers, the vertical and lateral circular motion, are believed to have been observed on both occasions. The object was estimated to have been at an altitude of approximately 1,000 to 2,000 feet. The observer was a civilian, a commercial air pilot by occupation.

A second sighting was reported at 2135 EST. A smaller, white object was reported at that time, but no details were available as to its maneuvers or other characteristics.

The foregoing is a summary of the information available from this sighting as obtained through interrogation of the observers. The interrogation was conducted in a manner to insure completeness of information and authenticity of the report."
