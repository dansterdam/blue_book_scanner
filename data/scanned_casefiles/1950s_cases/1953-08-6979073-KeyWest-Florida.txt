SUMMARY, (Enter basic narrative of report. Give conclusions in final coordination paragraph. List indorsers in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 718-Part 1(2))

On 20 July and 1 August 1953 Seaman Apprentice Charles B. De Forrest, a student at the Fleet Sonar School, United States Naval Base, Key West, Florida, observed an aerial object in the sky over the town of Key West. The first sighting was between 2200 and 2230 EST and the second was at 2135 EST. The object appeared to be about the size of a pin point or a star, was very bright white in color, and on 20 July it proceeded rapidly from low on the western skyline to a point directly forward and overhead. On 1 August it appeared at the same point on the horizon but was obscured by clouds at the zenith of its flight path. No mechanical characteristics were noted. The object made regular course changes in course locally during its observation but was not observed to modify a regular or vertically. The observer does not appear to be extremely extroverted, appeared to be very stable, and desires no publicity, rather, he, at times, gave the impression he wished he had not seen the object.

This office has no comment upon the report other than to note that the observer appeared to have been skeptical of his own sighting and checked it against whatever known data were available to him with the result that he decided he had seen some object with which he was not familiar.

THE INTERVIEW

the interview continued and he was conversing more easily at the end.
at no time did he exhibit any excitement about the sighting. He gave
the impression that he wanted to be very exact in his answers and give
precise data for all aspects of his observation. He stated he had not
mentioned the sighting to any newspapers and he would not trust them to
give a true version of his account, nor to protect his from public ridi-
cule. He asked for and received assurance in a call he later, at an
officer's home, collect, in the event he made another sighting.

F.     Weather and winds aloft conditions at time and place of sighting were
as follows:

24 July

        Weather Observer reported a "broken overcast" which cleared up sufficiently
to leave most of the sky clear. Clouds were scattered as solid to the west in the
area of the object's appearance. A check with the CAA office of the U.S. Weather
Bureau at Boca Chica Key revealed the following data: ceiling 22,100 - 25,000, thin
scattered clouds; visibility ten miles, temperature 74°; relative humidity 55%;
sea level pressure 1016.9 millibars; altitude setting 30.02 inches; station

north-south line and that he attempted to maintain a check on the flight path by this method throughout the observations. On this basis, he stated the object was noticed first due west at approximately 30° above the horizon and immediately above the sky line which was formed by trees surrounding the home. It proceeded generally from east, except for the maneuvers described in paragraph 5 above. No estimate of the distance or height was attempted by the observer since, he stated, he did not know the true size of the object.

On 1 August he was alone when he first noticed the object and called his wife, [name blacked out], and Mrs. [name blacked out] to watch the object again.

INFO

24 July 1953                                                  Key West, Florida

Description

Between the hours of 2200 and 2230 EST, a student at the Fleet Sonar School, United States Naval Base, Key West, Florida, observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over the town of Key West. The object appeared to be approximately the size of a pin point or a star, very bright white in color, proceeded rapidly from low on the western skyline to a point directly forward and overhead. The object then blinked out momentarily before descending below the eastern skyline. No aerodynamic features, trail, exhaust, propulsion system, or sound were noted. Speed was reported as unknown, since the observer did not know the object's true air size or its distance from him. The observer stated that the object appeared to move in regular smooth circles.

Discussion

Inquiry was made as to the observer's general reputation and character. His superior in Sonar Operations stated that he had no knowledge of the observer except during duty hours. The supervisor gave him a character rating of "very good", "above reproach", and described him as a quiet, conscientious, good student - not outstanding, but above average. The interviewer stated that the observer appeared to be stable, well-adjusted, and very consistent with his answers after considerable questioning.

The weather at the time of the observation was reported as a broken overcast. Clouds were reported to be solid to the west where the object disappeared. A check with CAA office of U.S. Weather Bureau at Boca Chica Key revealed a ceiling of 22,300 feet.

There were several aircraft in the area and one of them was equipped with a searchlight. There is a probability that the observer saw the searchlight scanning the area.

Conclusion

Other - Probably searchlight on aircraft.

23 November 1953

Dear Capt. Harding:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just now gotten down to looking over the large batch of accumulated reports. I must say that compared with Black Hawk, none of these approaches was incident in interest. There are a few interesting sightings, but on none of these is information sufficient to make a follow-up profitable.

Of the interesting ones, the very similar sightings of 21 July and 1 August at Key West, which weren't follow-up is that they were more recent with present information I have no suggested explanations.

The 25 July Perrin AFB Texas also holds possible interest from the standpoint of maneuvers and the fact they were observed from the Control Tower and by civilians of Dennison, Texas.

It is too bad there is not more information on Creola, Ala. These cases cover four separate days. There is possibly part in these.

Finally, the Sidi Slimane sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably have to remain on the books as unexplained.

As for the remaining 30 or so, there is so little information concerning those with no obvious explanations that there is no percentage whatever in considering them seriously.

Thus, out of the total number there are 1 independent sets which, if staff and time were available, would be interesting to pursue. Personally, I vote for sticking with the Black Hawk case until we have squeezed it dry. I feel certain that if this case can be explained, others would follow suit.

Concerning the Black Hawk case, we are proceeding slowly but surely with the investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the evidence. Since the observations covered several hours and sightings were both visual and radar, it is important, in my estimation, that we continue to pursue this since failure to identify pinpoints a possible real weakness in our defense set-up. I hope to have a preliminary report on this case for you soon.

1. Report follows of the information obtained by this office in compliance with
message AFOIN-ATIAC-7-25-3 from the Commander, ATIC, Wright Patterson AFB. Delay in
reporting was caused by inability to contact the observer due to the message bearing
been received on Saturday, 1 August 1953. The time consumed in arranging for a definite time and place for interviewing the observer, and the need for coordinating
available transportation consisted chiefly of the ensuing continuance of this delay
with to Charleston, South Carolina. Complete cooperation was extended by all levels
of command contacted, both Air Force and Navy, in order to insure completion of the
investigation. Pertinent information is submitted in the order established by paragraph 76, AFR 200-5.

a. Only one object was sighted on each occasion. It was very bright white
in color but so small that the observer stated he could just barely see it. It was
reported to be about the size of a pin point or a star of ordinary size and luminance.
As approximately first, about 1230, probable 26 July 1953, or about 1830 observed.
Speed was reported as unknown, since the observer did not know the object's true size
or its distance from him. It was reported to have traversed an angle of 120° from
east to east in one and one half minutes time. The first sighting on 26 July 1953
and 50° in approximately forty seconds during the second sighting on 1 August 1953.
The object took a broad straight course, vertically, from west to east; however
lateral movements were said to have been observed on both occasions. These maneuvers,
or changes of course, were described as lateral 45° angular legs, or zig zag, along
the vertical course and level or lateral circles. The observer was insistent that
the individual saw the same object on both occasions, and at the
same angles, and that they varied from side to side along the vertical courses. As
reported to the interviewing officer, these changes in course can be most accurately
described as the type of course described as being a level, mild, undulating, or
twisting altitude. The circles, or turns, were described as regular, smooth, and all
of the same radius. A graphic description of these maneuvers is included as inclosure 1a. On 26 July, the object disappeared completely approximately three or four degrees
above the sky line after blinking out and reappearing four or five times. On 1 August
the object disappeared from view in a similar manner. The observer was questioned
extensively. The observer also stated that he believed the object based on the
observation was something other than a conventional aircraft. He was positive that
some form of a disc or circular object was seen, but was hesitant to say as much as
a disc. The observer was a reliable source of information and was considered by the
interviewing officer to be credible.

b. For 26 July and 1 August the times of sighting were reported to be between 2200 and 2220 EST and at 2135 EST, respectively. Converted to Z time these
would be 0300 to 0320 and 0235. The first sighting later probably one and
one half minutes and the second for approximately forty seconds. The observer's time
estimates were checked by the interviewing officer by simple time occurrences; the observer was
consistent in his estimates.
