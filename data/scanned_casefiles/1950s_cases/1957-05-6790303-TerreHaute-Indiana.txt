AIR FORCE ARIADA CHASES, MISSES, DOGGES OVER ATLANTIC
May 11, 1957: Several of our members who are with local COG posts volunteered the following information, independently from both Brooklyn and Manhattan posts:
In the early morning hours of Saturday, May 11, a jet scramble involving a large number of military planes took place. Our Manhattan informant first reported that the planes were headed in the general direction of New England, but he was advised by official personnel that two jet squadrons (about 16 planes) had been dispatched - one from Stewart AFB in Newburgh, N.Y. and the other from a base on Cape Cod (presumably Otis AFB) - to investigate under observations by coastal radar patrol planes and picket boats, of three bogies heading inland south of Cape Cod in a southwesterly course. No contact with the unknown was made by the jets, and radar lost track of the objects.

On May 13, 1957, two men observed a UFO hovering over Terre Haute, Indiana. The object, which was first observed at 10:35 PM, was described as round, bright orange in color, and appearing to be about 40 feet in diameter. It was seen floating above the trees at an estimated height of 250-300 feet. The object remained stationary for several minutes, during which time the observers watched it through binoculars. It then began to move slowly, picking up speed, and disappeared from sight within a few seconds. The witnesses reported that the UFO made no sound.

along slowly, making this racket. It was metallic, like the metal of a silver dollar, and the soumded it to be six or seven feet across. She assumed it was flat, but wasn't actually sure of the shape. It was moving along about three feet high, which she thought was odd. When it got some 20 feet away from being directly above, it stopped motion and the noise ceased. After a few moments, it proceeded in the same direction as before and headed on, but the noise did not resume - it was completely quiet.

This woman's impression was that the object moved about 150 or 200 feet away and fell into some pine trees on a little rise. That night she and her husband wanted to look in the woods where she thought she saw the thing go, but the rain had washed away its tracks and it was too dark to make a thorough search. Whatever it was, she probably moved rapidly away at low altitude, and she received an erroneous impression of the object falling. According to the neighbors, with whom she talked, the two of them continued their search the next day, but found nothing. Finding nothing, and reading nothing in the newspapers, the husband called the Air Force office. He was most reluctant to do so, since people advised him against mentioning what he had seen. However, he agreed to let the paper publish their story anonymously. Later, the reporter called me (after he had investigated and determined for himself that they were sincere), and I went down and talked to them. We found nothing and we found no other people in the area who had seen or heard the device.

I'm inclined to think the woman saw something quite unusual. She is about 35 years of age, and has had a high school education. Furthermore, she is familiar with jet aircraft, since their landing pattern passes over the area.

GLATTERING UFO MAKES REPAIRS
May 23, 1957: This report came in a letter from CSI member Jim McAshen, of Knoxville,
"A lady living some ten miles from Knoxville ran into something that shook her considerably. I talked to her several days after the incident. It occurred on Tuesday, May 21, and she didn't tell her husband about it until that night, when he got home. The sighting was at 10:10 p.m. She appeared seeing an object making a noise like a runaway power mower. When first noticed, the object was making a noise like a runaway power mower. She said it wasn't too high - just above tree-top level, and it seemed to bounce.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document:

On May 22 or 23, 1952, at 2:15 a.m., Robert Andrews, of Terre Haute, Indiana, saw a strange light in the sky near the north end of the Indiana State Teachers College campus. The light was disc-shaped and about 150 feet in diameter. It hovered above the second story front apartment. At 3:15 a.m. it moved off and disappeared in the north. The sound was described as a rushing noise, similar to a jet plane, but it was silent.

The material burned brilliantly and continued to glow for a considerable time after the object disappeared. The flight path was 3 miles long and left no trace. The object was brightly illuminated and visible for a considerable distance. As it moved away, the intensity of the light gradually diminished.

The material was quite unlike anything Andrews had ever seen before. He concluded it was not a comet, meteor, or any conventional aircraft. The glow from the material was so brilliant it lit up the area as if it were daylight. The object was estimated to be 150 feet in diameter, and the glow was estimated to be about 3 feet in diameter.

PLEASE CONSIDER THIS INFORMATION AS CONFIDENTIAL. HEREAFTER ALL CORRESPONDENCE REFERRING TO THE SAME SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO: DIRECTOR, INTELLIGENCE, DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE, WASHINGTON 25, D.C. BOX 1589, HARTFORD, NEW JERSEY, U.S.A.

Information taken from Mr. Andrews on 9 February 1953.

AERIAL BALLET OVER CINCINNATI
May 24, 1957- The following sight-seeing incident is sent to us by our friend and colleague, John Stiregile, of Cincinnati:

"I want to tell you about an aerial ballet which our family witnessed over Cincinnati. We were driving in our car to the home of friends who live in Hartcourt, in eastern Cincinnati, about 7:15 p.m. The sun was low on the horizon. I spotted first, to the northwest, numerous vapor trails; they were in no kind of parallel patterns but seemed in converging, looping and forming S-curves. They were all in the same quadrant of the sky. Apparently an aerial ballet was taking place. 

I stopped the car and we watched this intensely, for about 7 minutes. The ballet moved swiftly, and I saw clearly a silvery, spherical object in the center of the trails, though I could also see the trail of the vapor. The object appeared stationary, while the trails were in motion. The object left no trails of vapor, while the jets surrounding it were leaving long, twisting trails.

I continued observing - whilst I could also see the jets from their speed apparently approaching Settie Road, where our friends live. I saw clearly a silvery, spherical objected as though it were the center of the ballet, though I cannot say if the latter were at full throttle. When we got to our friend's home, I could still see similar vapor trails in the sky, but nothing else.

The aerial ballet had centered mainly in the dry north section of Cincinnati. Wright, of our Sales Department, came down to my office voluntarily to describe what he had seen. He described the UFO in detail, looking like a silvery, spherical object, and he said he could distinguish the jets easily, and said he believed he counted at least seven in number. He added that most of the show too confusing to relate, but he clearly remembered one occasion when the jets closed in and the UFO receded or maneuvered in such a way that it eluded them easily. Visited this site described another maneuver; the UFO was stationary and when jets closed in in pairs, it shot away to and so on, leading the jets approached to interfere. He added that it was a direct, horizontal reversal course. Wright was certain that it was a direct, horizontal reversal course. 

Both Wright and I guessed that the performance took place at about 25,000 feet. We agreed that the apparent size of the object was larger than the jets, perhaps twice as large. On the same morning that I got Wright's report, I heard on the Air Force Center in Columbus; they took my report, but denied any UFO activity the evening before."

The text in the document is as follows:

GREEN FIREBALL OVER WESTERN JERSEY

May 29, 1957: In Washington, New Jersey, CGI member Juliia Hasker had taken her dog for a walk at about 11:10 p.m. Suddenly becoming aware of a bright light that had diminished, this Miss Hasker looked the north northwest and saw, about 65° above the northern horizon, an intensely brilliant green fireball. The angular measurement of the fireball was slightly less than that of the full moon. The fireball was surrounded with a halo that was circular in shape, for a very slight dragging protuberance at the rear. Trailing behind the fireball were some of the green and white "sparklies" Miss Hasker written "After an instant of viewing, she noticed that the width of the intensely bright green disk had increased to about one half the width of the moon's disk." For an instant (perhaps as long as a second) after the fireball struck the ground a distinct center with very small fine particles surrounding it. For an instant (perhaps as long as a second) after this, a shower of green and white sparkles hung in the air where the fireball had been. It had been in view for no more than six seconds. Miss Hasker's description of the typical green fireball type of UFO. We are indebted to her for an unusually careful and detailed report.

May 1, 1957: In Greenwich, Connecticut, the wife of a commercial artist went outdoors to look for the comet. To the northwest she saw a streak of very bright white light, straight and miles in length. This reached it for about 60 seconds, then went indoors to look for her husband, telling him "This is the brightest comet you ever saw!" When they went outdoors, no more than a minute had elapsed, but the streak was gone. It had been observed, however, that the ending streak showed no diffusion as is the case with a jet trail. This case has not yet been followed up completely, but CSI hopes to obtain more details. Paul Harris brought the case to the attention of the Research Section.

FIREBALL OF 1957 MAY 1/2

On this date a bright fireball was seen at 10:41 p.m., EST, and reported from St. Mary's, Ohio. This was subsequently confirmed by Ohio State University Observatory, and the Ohio State Police in Columbus, who reported that three reports were quite complete. The observers, being in order, K.L. ("Observer on whose report the calculations were made"), Crouch, Prof. of Astronomy, Ohio State University, and Ohio State Police. The message further stated that this fireball was observed from points in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, and was unusually bright, with a duration of 5-6 seconds. The object left a long-lasting trail.

The calculated data follows:
BEGIN OVER
Began over
Radiant R.A.
Radiant Dec.
Projected length of path
Duration
Velocity (calculated from projected length and duration)
Velocity (corrected for altitude)

= 73 24'; DEC = 55 54' at 132 km
= 105 km
= 197 km
= 5 secs (probably less)
= 40 km/sec (probably high)
= 37 km/sec at 83 km

The object is believed to be considerably faster than the heights of 83-132 km would indicate, the attitudes observed being 83-132 km. We are under many obligations to the three observers who reports made the observations possible. Fireball No. 15 in the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Meteor Catalogue, even 1956 Aug. 8.

CIGAR OVER MOUNT VERNON

May 7, 1957: Arthur Guillen had just left his home in Mount Vernon, New York, on his way to work. The time was about 8:10 a.m. Glancing up he saw in the southern sky a large white cigar-shaped object moving quite rapidly. The object seemed to be about the diameter of the moon. As he stood and watched, he saw the object make "funny motions" as it moved upward and forward by about one-quarter its own length. He was quite certain about this motion, since he had the moon above the object and the planet Jupiter behind towards its point of reference. He watched the object for about five minutes, and then it disappeared behind willow trees. When he had passed them, he found that the object was no longer in view. Arriving at work, Mr. Guillen immediately told what he had seen to CSI member Frank Bordes, who advised the Research Section of the incident.

It was on this night that the "mystery jet(s)" buzzed Manhattan. A careful check of the CDC records at the Manhattan and Brooklyn posts failed to disclose any reports of "unknowns" over the city on that night. So far as we know, there is no connection between the two incidents.

Strange Jet Over Gotham
Proves to Be Navy Plane

NEW YORK, May 7 (AP) - The objects of jet flights kept pouring out the sky from McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey today in a case of mistaken identity. 

The sky watcher, a member of the Civilian Air Defense Observation Post of the 26th Air Division, reported sighting a strange jet plane over Manhattan. 

The military immediately launched a jet interceptor from McGuire Air Force Base to investigate. After a long chase, the interceptor pilot reported back that the strange jet was actually a Navy plane which had been on a routine patrol.

The sky watcher, who couldn't find the object with his binoculars, had called in the alarm. Air Defense Command at McGuire Air Force Base had launched the jet interceptor to check on the report.

The Air Defense Command said today it was the third such incident in the past several hours that led to the launching of interceptor jets from McGuire. The spokesman said the Air Defense Command had checked all these cases and found that none had jets planes in the air."

REPORT BY PROJECT OFFICER
The meeting about 10:00 P.M., officials in charge at TERRE HAUTE AIRPORT witnessed a flight. Airplanes observing 'lights' meeting, windows and canities of moving object seen. The Tentative slid into motion, then went out of sight, that was located to the "lights" case. They both bright alternating colors, disappearance. Had light as at reported 'plane' was cut off and I lost sight of it. 
A 12:00 P.M. slips appeared on the water as "what is same" continued in motion. Approximately over 40 minutes after the lights disappearance. One light located out-door with the other. Then, they suddenly moved together rapidly down over the horizon apparently together. Same appears to be a temporary spaced lights, it may be the result of reflection or other known phenomena.
