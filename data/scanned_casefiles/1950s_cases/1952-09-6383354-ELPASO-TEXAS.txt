SOURCE OF OBSERVATION: Source observed six groups of luminous, spherical, or disc-shaped objects (or lights) traveling in "arch" to "dispersed" in location at speed 4000 mph, altitude 10-12 miles. Maneuvers were erratic, and included hovering and extremely high speed rectilinear flight.

Group Number 5, was very similar to that of Number 2- although it was traveling in the westerly sky.

The time of appearance for this group of lights was approximately 12:00 to... September 15, 1952.

There was no change in the spotty haze in the western sky end; no were able to view through the clearness this group of lights, so under similar conditions to that when viewing Group Number 3. all conditions of brilliance was equal to the other groups, and there was no coronito

At exactly 12:45 AM September 15, 1952, there suddenly appeared in the eastern sky and approaching from a northeasterly direction and traveling in a southwesterly direction, the most interesting of all the luminous displays and groups of traveling light, so far observed.

This particular group of spherical luminous bodies was traveling in the same general direction and flying course as the others so appearing in the eastern sky, but, it was in the perfect Y form as shown on the Map Chart as Number 5, with the leg of the Y form leading in the direction of travel and the Y being somewhat longer than the other groups, and so spread out in its perfect and symmetrical form, was truly interesting to say the least.

The spacing of all the spherical balls of luminous light were in even order; and, in this particular order it definitely appeared that the peripheral edge of one sphere to that of the other, would be about three-quarters of the diameter of any one sphere. All spheres had equal diameters.

The high speed luminous Y of lights as they passed over head and to the east, were definitely most inspiring, due to the symmetrical order, as in their order of progression, definitely gave the impression of the long pointed nose of a "Jet" plane with its sonic nose tip; it illuminated with a string of lights. From the tip of the nose to a distance, distance and then at this point spreading into the two arms which formed the balanced Y.

Due to the fact that of all the displays observed during this period of observation, there had never been any now of lights in progressive order following each other. This Y display, gave the opportunity to note 12 these were any connections between the trailing light units. In this case there were no connections and there was no oozonic affect - no change in the color luminosity, and certainly was did not appear to be any cause for the change in the color or the luminosity of the light units.

The view was certainly very awe inspiring, fantastic and exciting in all respects. This Y display through its symmetrical and balanced formation gave the writer will definitely point out later.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Page-3.

This Y formation, disappeared from view, without going over the horizon.
It first seemed to vanish in thin air; or- there may have been a sudden
turning on the axis, without cause the lights to vanish from view. In
the lights of the Y, from the foot of the leg to the end of the arm,
went out of view, the action some what appears as though each light was
turned off as once or travel across.

Display Number 7- 11:00 AM September 15,1952- was a semi-circle form as
was equal to the semi-circles of Number 4 and 5 as shown on the Map Chart
with the exception that there was a very noticeable amount of frontal
movement of the individual lights in the forward arc of this semi-circle
in its forward line of travel. Here again, the movement of these lights
was similar to that of Number 5, and apparently disappeared in have
gone. At no time was a few seconds of the 11 or course, flight of
this group, did it appear that any of the lights came in contact with
any of the other lights, there appeared to be a haze of lights without
any contact.

All of the lights in this group were solid, as such to the other
most displays. There was no contact electrical effect observed, and no
change of the white light to that of any of the single or varying size
colors. This display was observed in the western sky, and following
the same general northwest course as that of Number 6, with no loss of
elevation and passed from view without passing over the horizon.

Display Number 8- was observed at approximately 1:20 AM, September 15,
1952.
This display of a full semi-circle of lights, which and while in their
line of flight, did not in any way vary from the course of flight and did
not rear or yaw in flight.

This flight of lights was observed in the southern sky, following the
same general northwesterly course as that of Number 6. This
flight did not disappear over the horizon, but simply released from
view in the south westerly sky. There was no variation in the elevation
of the flight at any time.

The star positioning was definitely noted by the observer (writer) so the
time with head compass, the general course and direction could be checked
This aspect was accomplished the following evening.

There were no additional flights of lights, after Number 8; although
these were views for several more hours.

On the evening of September 15,1952, the same group of observers made it
their interest to view the skies once more.

This nightly practice has been carried on by the first observer, but,
as yet no further displays of these lights in group has been observed.
High speed traveling lights, will eventually come as indicated in the
view, but the eyes and mind will immediately pick up any displays
which occur.

The elapse of time in seconds, from the instance of first vision to the point of disappearance is so very short, that it would be impossible for any person to use observing glasses or instruments of any kind. Also, from ground level, it would be impossible for any observer, not associated with an observing staff properly equipped, and where all of the celestial factors for the period were known, and thus offer an observer flight, express any views other than those of a generalized nature.

In viewing this display of lights and the interest so created, it is the writer's view that nothing that is here quoted will aid the general public and wish to know more about this scientific display, whether it is in the order of the nature or can make, when the following suggestion is offered. (If may now be in practice and not the knowledge of the writer or the public, all for the protective benefit for our action and contingent.

At the various army and navy posts- a constant guard watch should be posted with the proper equipment. This should apply to many interested people in public life and interest.

In closing this: The writer will make no suggestions as to the why's, or to the cause about this observed display. Will sincerely state that any and all parties wishing for a new field of definite scientific interest, can now find such by taking the time out each might for observation. The slight knowledge of astronomy and navigational which the writer studied in years past, has now proved of real value.

This is respectfully submitted, to those of greater know-how and with the sincere appreciation that this little contribution and extension of effort can justly enhance the value of this new science and study.

1. The following report was received from [redacted] Consulting Engineer:

a. Source reported observing six (6) groups of unknown spherical or disc-shaped objects (or lights) in the sky over the El Paso, Texas area on 13 September 1952. Objects were reported as being in formations ranging from "loose" to "tight". Some gathered at 29,000 feet. Distance to objects at 4,000 miles was estimated. Sightings were made at 1500 hours.

b. First "formation" was sighted at 2300 at 13 September 1952. The sixth and last group was observed at 1530 on 13 September 1952. Sighting was visible, although not estimated as to precise time.

c. All observations were made by the naked eye. No optical or electronic means were utilized.

4. Observer was stationed near the Santa Fe Bridge (crossing Rio Grande River) at El Paso, Texas, and was a local resident. Objects were first witnessed at estimated 105 degrees (south-southeast), and were in a northwesterly direction. Altitude of observation was estimated by source to be 66,000 feet above horizon.

5. Witness stated that he was accompanied by three (3) persons, all of whom were sources or witnesses can [text cuts off]

f. No known activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, has been determined at this time which would account for the sightings. Physical evidence has been found or reported. No interception was attempted. No ground, air, and military radar tracking was accomplished in the El Paso area at time of sightings, and no traffic was known to be in the vicinity.

The "LIGHTS OF CARMINE"

To Whom, this may concern:- in the realm and profession of scientific studies.

The following resume, is a description of an unusual manifestation of Celestial Lights, as observed by the writer and three other observers, on the night of September 14, 1952. This display of unusual lights, certainly are not a natural occurrence to the sky on a clear night, when viewing the Celestial Bodies of the sky on a clear night.

The first viewing of these unusual lights with their high-speed travel through the sky, was first observed by headlight, by the writer's wife. The following will not as to observed facts and therefore may be used with considerable caution, but will result in the precise accounting of data and information on the subject.

[Redacted text] on the night of September 14, 1952 was sitting in my car with Mrs. [Redacted], Columbus, Mexico.

The car was facing north, thus allowing [Redacted] to view the east-west sky, on sitting on the right side of the car.

At 11:30 P.M. (basic time in El Paso-- 12:30 P.M. C.S.T. (basic time for Mexico)) Mrs. Chase, the writer's wife, observe, and immediately attracts my attention to a group of very brilliant lights, quite high in the easterly sky and traveling in a course slightly northwest, as a group of very brilliant light spheres.

On the "Celestial Map Chart" of this observation, this first group of lights is designated as "Group Number 1".

This group of lights was traveling at a very high rate of speed, on its southwesterly course. There was no turning to the right, the left or in elevation. This group of lights definitely appeared to stay on its course without any deviation.

In this group of lights, it is estimated that there was at least twelve to fifteen round brilliant spheres, traveling in a straight line at right angles to the line of flight.

When this line of lights passed the observers in the easterly sky, the spheres of lights gave the appearance of the right and the left halves moving in an oscillating motion, similar manner to what of wings beat-ing in flight. With this observation, the writer did not see this motion; the center line; but always appeared to be functioning above the front line. This aspect is given as certain.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Page-2

The light spheres of this group, were in no way connected with the adjoining spheres.

The light limited from these light spheres was very similar to that while light from frostes electrical light glass.

There was no display of colors, and there did not appear to be any coronal electrical effect. In this respect, it may be noted that the speed and travel was such that several levels of the atmosphere, that the eyes did not have the proper time to become adjusted and especially when this was the first opportunity for observation.

These celestial lights, appeared out of the southeast sky and suddenly (apparent) in the northwest, moving in a spherical diameter and without passing over the horizon.

It is assumed from rough map scaling, that this line of flight in the east sky, would probably be a line of apparent flight, between 75 and 100 miles in length. In this respect, this is absolute assumption, on my part or may omit this. Then so viewing for the first time such a line of lights and their sudden display and especially when the time of observed travel was so very short in seconds. Several seconds would be continued to travel will apparent distances.

The report from the fifth Director of Intelligence at Hq Air Base, 21 Paso, Tex., included to the fact that the night of cloud haze over the Base on the night of September 14, 1952 was between 40,000 and 25,000 feet in elevation.

As this group of traveling light spheres moved rapidly across the southwestern sky, it was very apparent that these objects were very much active the slight cloud. In this case, the lights, when viewed through the spots of haze were less brilliant and then out of the haze the brightness would appear.

Immediately after the passage of this display, Mr. [redacted] brought to the attention of this display, to her rather and another senior and junior officer some people then spent the additional time to view the sizes for the possibility of additional displays, which did come into view, as are now numbered-2-3-4-5-6-7-, for which they have signed their names in three sheets.

At the moment senior [redacted] viewed the skies, he and the writer noticed [redacted] immediately, some and pointed in the direction of the southern sky, where a group of lights suddenly appeared and was observed by all of the viewers in this group. This group is about on the same line of travel as the first group, which traveled over the horizon. This group was slightly higher in altitude, with about the same angular displacement as the first group.

Group Number 5, was very similar to that of Number 2- although it was traveling in the Westerly sky.

The time of appearance for this group of lights was approximately 12:30 AM September 15, 1952.

There was no change in the spots, haze in the western sky and thus, we were able to view the clearness that this group of lights, as under similar conditions to that when viewing Group Number 5. All conditions of brilliance was a pal to the other groups, and there was no coronic effect.

At exactly 22:45 AM September 15, 1952, there suddenly appeared in the eastern sky and approaching from a northeasterly direction and traveling in a southwesterly direction, the most interesting of all the luminous displays, and groups of same lights, so observed.

This particular group of aerial illuminates coded was traveling in the same general direction and flying course as the others, so passing in the eastern sky with it was in the perfect Y form as shown on the key chart as Number 6, with the leg of the Y forming the leading tip. This direction of travel was in the Y traveling, in the form, with the Y being somewhat longer than the other groups, and so spread out in its perfect and symmetrical form, was truly interesting to say the least.

The grouping of all the spherical balls of luminous light were in even order; and, in this particular order, it definitely appeared that the peripheral edge of one sphere to that of the other, would be about three-quarters of the diameter of any one sphere. All shapes had equal diameters.

The high speed luminous of lights as they passed over west and to the east, were definitely and instantaneously, as to their progression, definitely gave the impression of the long points: nose of a "Jet" plane with its sonic nose tip; if illuminated with a long of lights, from the tip of the nose to a determine distance and then at this point spreading into two arms which forced the balance Y.

Due to the fact that of all the displays observed during this period of observation, there had never been any row of lights in progressive order following each others. This Y display, gave the opportunity to note if there were any connections between the trailing light units. In this case there were no connections and there was no coronic display. The white luminous, and certainly white as a light might appear to be, did not seem to be the same color block in the space between the light units. This view was certainly very awe inspiring, notable and unusual.

All aspects, with this Y progression through the southwesterly sky, will definitely determine a distance of approximately 1,000 miles or more.

The same conditions of flight travel were noted, when the traveling spheres passed over the clear and hazy areas in the southern sky, as did apply to the group of spheres in Number 1. Again by assumption, the night above the base, approx. to be equal to that of the above spheres above the ground level, or possibly higher. There was absolutely no time or line movement of the spheres, in their course of travel during the visual period. In this there was no display of color, and the spheres individually had the same appearance of those in group Number 1. There was no appearance of any coronic electrical effect.

This group Number 2, continued on its course, and there was no wear or tear which would vary its group levels. Factors of this display were quickly noted in the position of the stars and briefly recorded for reference.

At 12:00 P.M. (Twilight) the four observers, noted to sudden appearance since of a very old signal group of east traveling illuminated spheres, in the westerly arc, and exactly to location, as marked on the chart, southwesterly as that of Group Number 1. This is shown on the chart.

This group was exceedingly interesting to view, as there was not any frontal line of flight that definitely appeared to be stable, for the reason that within this quite odd and spaced appearance of this group, there was an inner movement of its illuminated spheres, that moved from position to these other without contacting each other in flight; as is some times observed in the unsuspecting action of the "aurora borealis".

This group appears to have an equal elevation above the earth and appeared to follow its course in a southwesterly direction without wear or yaw. And, it too, disappeared from view without passing over the horizon. There was no views of any coronic electrical effect and no colors.

Group Number 4, appeared in the easterly sky at about 10:15 P.M. September 15, 1952, in a semi-circular form.

The odd manifesteth on of this display, was the fact that as this group passed to the south in the easterly sky, the observers were able to note with curious interest, that the left wing of the semi-circle, moved in a somewhat wavy form. This was at the center of the left circle, which was about 150 degrees. This wave form in movement of the southeasterly flight apparently did not alter the line of flight or cause any wave, nor was it also a direct alteration of flight, or any degree of interference; it appeared to be a natural function in the course of flight.
