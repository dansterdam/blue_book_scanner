Group Number 5, was very similar to that of Rumor 2- although it was the time of appearance for this group of lights was approximately 12:30. This particular group of lights was traveling in a westerly direction and there were no changes in the aspects when they were traveling in the western sky and drifting away. The manner of the flight of this group was also similar to the other groups, and there was no corroboration of brilliances.

At approximately 12:45 AM September 15, 1952, there suddenly appeared in the sky a group of illuminated objects that were traveling in a northerly direction. This particular group of illuminated objects was traveling very fast and the number could not be accurately determined, but it was in the perfect formation as known as echelon, which has a diagonal line of march. This group was traveling in the western sky and, as in the previous cases, it was in the perfect formation as shown in the sketch. The speed and the area of the lights were traveling in the same case as the previous groups, and symmetrical form was distinctly observed.

The sighting of all the illuminated lights were in a green order, and in this particular order it definitely appeared that the distance of the diameter of any one of the others would be about three to four times the diameter of any one sphere. All the objects had equal brilliancies.

The high speed luminous movement of the lights passed overhead and to the east, and the disappearance was sudden - the lights went out of sight abruptly. This maneuver is described as similar to the previous case, and is definitely more pronounced, and the lights were moving in a somewhat different order - a diagonal formation. The impression received at this point regarding the two arms or formations of lights was that they were traveling in a diagonal line, and the distance and span between the two arms was about the same as the diameter of the other arm.

Due to the fact that of all the displays observed during this period of time, there had been an easy and progressive following each other. This was a visible case to note if there were no occurrences and that there was no erratic maneuvering - the lights simply disappeared out of sight.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old report document related to Project Blue Book, containing text describing a sighting of lights in the sky.

This X-formation, disappearing from view, without sound, over the horizon. This was a semi-circle form as well to the north of the observer, of lights, which appeared to be located on the east side of the horizon. The lights seem to have followed around the curve of the horizon, without a break in the line of lights, as the observer turned off as advance of travel occurred. At the time, September 15, 1952, the object 7-1-1952- was a semi-circle form as well, on the north side of observer, of lights, which seemed to be located on the east side of the horizon. The movement of the individual lights in the manner reported seems to indicate a central movement of the semi-circle, rather than individual flight of the lights. At its time, it gave the impression of a group of satellite lights revolving around a common center. There were no additional flights or lights, either before or after the incident, as observed by the observer. This flight of lights was observed in the southern sky, following the course of flight and did not disappear over the horizon, but simply vanished from view at a point indicating elevation and passed from view without passing over the horizon.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically the file "1952-09-6383354-ELPASO-TEXAS.pdf5.txt".

The text on the page is as follows:

The class of time in seconds, from the instance of first vision to the departure is 20 seconds. At the time it would be impossible for any person to have observed the objects or instruments as instruments of any kind were not visible, any description or identification of such would be guess work and not a true statement of facts.
The celestial factors for the period were known, and these factors are considered necessary to a complete understanding of the case.

In regard to "this display of lights and do's" expressed, it is the writer's belief and opinion that if the celestial display was visible, many of the statements whether it is so in order of the exhibit or the nature of the display as described, may not be in keeping with the actual facts. There may be an inclination to exaggerate in describing phenomen a which are not well understood by the public. The writer reserves judgment whether it is so or not. The public will undoubtedly draw their own conclusions, and the writer makes no attempt to influence their judgment or opinions.

As the various army and navy factors are constant, it is constant that the time should show to many observers. Apparently this seems to be the case.

In closing: The writer will state no suggestions as to the why's or to theorize about this observed display, but will simply reiterate that in the interest of scientific approach to the problem, and because of the sincerity appreciation that this little contribution and attention of efforts can be mutually to our advantage.

This is respectfully submitted to those of greater know-how and with the sincere appreciation that this little contribution and observation of efforts can be mutually to our advantage.

THE FLIGHT OF CARMEN

To Whom. this may concern: in the realm and profession of scientific inquiry, the following resume is a description of an unusual manifestation of aerial phenomena observed on the night of September 14, 1952 - this display of unusual lights and motion on the horizon is hereby submitted as follows:

On the night of September 14, 1952, a group of witnesses observed a strange phenomenon in the sky over Chihuahua, Mexico. 

At about 11:30 P.M. (basic time for Central Standard Time U.S.A.) this group observed a number of very brilliant lights in the southeasterly sky, and traveling at a terrific rate of speed. These lights seemed to be part of a coordinated and very brilliant formation of lights or spheres. 

On the celestial chart or map of this observation, this first group of lights is designated as "Group Number 1."

This group of lights was traveling at a very high rate of speed, on its course, without any deviation. The formation of these lights definitely appeared on its course without any deviation.

In this group of lights, it is estimated that there was at least twelve individual lights traveling in a definite line or formation.

When this line of lights passed the observers, they observed that the lights went out, one by one, as they moved across the sky. This observation leads to the conclusion that each light was self-illuminating, and that the failure of the lights was not due to any screening or obstacle in the path of the lights.

- page 22 -

There is no photograph present in this document. The document appears to be a textual report from Project Blue Book, providing details about the sighting of a group of luminous objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

The light spheres of this group, were in no way connected with the conventional lights. This group of lights was noticed through a telescope, as they were situated at an extremely high altitude, much higher than ordinary aircraft. The white light from rockets or aircraft would shine through the telescope, but did not seem to have connection with this group. The lower sphere gave off small flashes of light spots from time to time, and appeared much larger than the others. There was no sound or apparent motion, but seemed like a stationary group of luminous objects. This was the first opportunity for observation.

These celestial lights, appeared out of the northeast sky, and were observed through a telescope. The highest light seemed to be most luminous, and the lower ones diminished in intensity toward the bottom.

It is reported from reliable sources, that this group of lights was observed at approximately 10:45 PM, and was visible for about 25 minutes. The lower sphere at times seemed to shift from an oval to a round shape, and this lower sphere was considerably larger than the other lights of the group.

The report from the Director of Intelligence at this time, indicates, that a similar display of lights was observed in this general area on September 14, 1952. The altitude of the display on this occasion was estimated to be between 20,000 and 30,000 feet.

As this group of traveling lights appeared, slowly across the southwestern sky, the brightest light in the center was observed first, and as the group progressed, the brightness of the light seemed to diminish. Immediately after the passing of this display, it was discovered, that the sky was completely devoid of any other celestial objects.

- page 23 -

There is no photograph present in this scanned document from Project Blue Book. The image shows a typed text report describing an unidentified aerial phenomenon sighting.

Group Number 3. was very similar to that of Number 2- although it was the time of appearance for this group of lights was approximately 18:30 hours.

The lights in this group were maneuvering in a pattern similar to that of Number 2 and they appeared to be at an altitude estimated to be about 20,000 feet.

The visual acuity of this group was good, and the observer stated that the shape of the lights was round, and he could not determine any structure like wings or fuselage. When this group passed overhead, no sound could be detected.

At exactly 12:45 All September 15, 1952- there suddenly appeared in the sky an object which was travelling at an extremely high speed, and it disappeared in a few seconds.

This particular group of unidentified illuminated bodies was travelling in a straight and level course, and it was in the northwest direction. It came from the northeast and disappeared in that direction. The duration of this group was approximately 10 minutes.

The sighting of all the physical balls or luminous lights were in even order. The size of the objects would be about one-half the size of the moon, would be about the size of a basketball, and the color was yellowish-white.

The high speed illumination that was observed was lights in a row. This appeared to be high altitude and great speed. The estimated speed was between 600 and 800 miles per hour. The duration of this sighting was only for a few seconds.

Due to the fact that of all the displays observed during this period of observation, there were almost identical, following each other in a definite sequence and timing. It is difficult to give these lights anything other than some kind of ordered or controlled a maneuver, which had not been explained to this date, and which the observer did not believe to be any of the normal celestial or man-made objects.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text in the document reads:

The same conditions of flight travel were noted. When the traveling observers went to the air field, they did not note the approach of a possible passage of a group of objects in August. Some attempt to trace the group was made in the opinion of the group, but to no avail. The objects appeared and disappeared without leaving any line movement of the sphere, as their course was not subject to travel guidance individually had the same characteristics of those in August. There was a close observance of these in relation to their maneuver.

This group number 2, traveling on its own lease, and where was no view or passage of this flight that were noted in the position of the stars. The group proceeded to maneuver for observation by the group was noted. 

At 12:00 p.m. (11:40 fight) the four observers noted the position of the round objects approaching at a high rate of speed approaching in a scattered formation. This group was subsequently following a track after observation. It is the opinion of the observers that this particular group carried a metallic, luminous aspect that conveyed the attitude of a unit.

This group was exceedingly interesting to view, as there was not any other reason that within the group did remain in a noticeable appearance of being limited to a time and space position. The positions to observe without contact such other in their different is not known.

This group appears to have the usual elevation above the earth, and appeared to follow, in a course in a southerly direction without any change in their colors.

Group numbers 13,14,15 appeared in the easterly 15 or 16 minutes after the initial sighting.

The odd manifestation of this display, was the fact that as this group was over, they did not note with curious interest, that the last wing of the small metallic objects, observed they were able to detect the excellent formation in which the objects were able to maintain. This indicates possibly, the excellency of the guidance and observation of these objects.
