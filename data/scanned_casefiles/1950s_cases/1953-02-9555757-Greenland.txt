PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 25 FEB 53
2. LOCATION: GREENLAND
3. SOURCE: MILITARY
10. CONCLUSION: WEATHER PHENOMENA
Upon the interrogation of the GCA operators, several discrepancies were found in the radar targets which are caused by meteorological conditions or weather effects on the scope.
4. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 4 MINS
5. TYPE OF OBJECTS: ONE
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: RADAR
7. COURSE: SW
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NO

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects
DATE: 13-255-53
PAGE: 3 of 4

The text in the document states the following:

On the upper air observations it was noted that a temperature inversion existed at an altitude of 3300 feet and possibly also at the 4600 feet level. The following upper air temperatures indicate the intensity of the inversion:
a. Ground temperature - -37 degrees C (centigrade)
b. At 1000 feet - -35 degrees C
c. At 3500 feet - -38 degrees C 
d. At 4000 feet - -41 degrees C
e. At 5000 feet - -40 degrees C

It goes on to discuss the final evaluation of the sightings, stating that they "were considered as phenomena type" and that certain details about the observations and the observers were provided. The document also discusses weather analysis and other factors that may have contributed to the sightings.

1. PLANNED PROJECT INDICATOR (PPI) 5390 was reported to this office and the Group Interrogation Sessions. Air Search as the chaining program could be determined. No interrogations were made. The information obtained is related below:

2. During the above TAV, the Traffic Controller noted the following: 
a. Lucas, a Civilian Airborne Air Traffic Controller in a C-54, observed an unidentified aircraft climbing and accelerating rapidly to approximately 50,000 feet. The aircraft was westbound and did not deviate from its course or take any evasive action. The aircraft was traveling at an estimated speed of approximately 1,300 knots.
b. The C-54 pilot, Captain Solis, spotted the unidentified aircraft while tracking the C-121 on his scope at a position approximately 10 miles SE of the scope baseline (original installation) outbound on a grid heading of 270 degrees, four miles NW (true bearing) from the C-121.

3. The unidentified sighting was tracked for a distance of three miles before it faded from the scope. The speed was estimated to be in excess of 1200 knots or better by the C-54 controllers. Altitude of the unidentified target was estimated to be above 50,000 feet, and under 60,000 feet, the scope's operating limitations.

4. The MATS C-121, which was on the downward leg of the traffic pattern at the time, had already passed over the center of the field at an altitude of 12,000 feet when the above incident occurred. The aircraft did not see anything. The MATS C-121 on its downwind leg passed over the center of the field at an altitude of 11,000 feet.

5. The data obtained is not sufficient to explain the unidentified sighting or to provide any conclusive evidence as to its identity. It appeared to be slightly faster than that of the C-121. The traffic pattern was not distorted in any way, and the unidentified did not in any way interfere with the MATS C-121 traffic.

3500 feet - from M at 15 Knots.
7000 feet - from M at 30 Knots.

PAGE 1 OF 1

The report describes unusual indications on radar scopes in strange patterns. The weather conditions coupled with the radar observations indicated no known identifiable targets. The report states that the sightings were attributed to a reflection or a meteor-like phenomenon.

The report is signed by J. A. LEWIS MAJOR, M/Sgt, USAF and E. J. HARRIS, Maj, USAF.
