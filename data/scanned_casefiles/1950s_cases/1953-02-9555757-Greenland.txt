8. On the upper air observations it was noted that a temperature inversion existed at an altitude of 3500 feet and possible at the 7000 feet level. The following upper air temperatures indicate the intensity of the inversion:

a. Ground temperature - -37 degrees C (Centigrade)
b. At 1000 feet - -33 degrees C
c. At 3500 feet - -38 degrees C
d. At 4000 feet - -41 degrees C
e. At 5600 feet - -40 degrees C
f. Above 5000 feet - Constant -40 degrees C

9. Both preliminary and the final evaluation of the sightings after all interrogations had been made indicate sighting to be a phenomena type.

10. The Group Intelligence Officer was advised of the sighting 15 minutes after its occurrence, all GCA personnel were contacted and AGW were contacted. Interrogations were made that same night by 1/Sgt Smith, GCA Team Chief, and S/Sgt Lucas, the interrogator. Captain Nelson, the MATS C-124 pilot as well as his navigator, weather personnel were consulted in detail. In the individual interrogation of the GCA personnel, it was noted that some discrepancies were made in the interrogation of the PPI scope. First, the time of the sighting was given by one man as about three minutes. At the same time, he stated its speed as slightly faster than that of the C-124. (Estimated at 180 Kn/hr or more.) The distance the object was tracked was three miles. This fact is positive as the scope is marked for accurate distance measurements. However, if its speed was as rapid as indicated, the longest time it could have been tracked would be a few minutes of one minute. On the other hand, if it was tracked for three minutes, its speed could not have been much over 60 Knots. Other discrepancies of the GCA interrogation were the scopes altitude limitation. The man indicated it at 5000 feet, the other 6000 feet. The distance between the C-124 ship and the unidentified blip was approximately ten miles. There was a 60 degree angle difference in their respective readings.

11. That AGW did not pick up the unidentified pretty well substantiates the fact that it did not exist. Had the object approached the base from any direction above 300 feet, it would have been detected. It certainly would have been picked up outbound as it passed beyond the 6000 foot limitation level of GCA.

12. The weather analysis lends a factor which can probably account for the phenomena. When an aircraft passes through an inversion layer as are peculiar to far northern arctic areas, the aircraft striking the super cooled moisture creates ice crystals which can reflect radar. This should not be confused with the C-124 aircraft over Cape York and passed over the base while holding down. At the particular time the C-124 was over the base, it was passing through the inversion layer. The weather analysis could explain the clear radar scope characteristics and would be the most logical explanation.

13. Similar phenomena could account for the indication on the scopes. It should be noted that this was an area with some rather unusual characteristics not typical of bases either north or south. Such items as temperature inversions, ice fog...

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO.
IR-255-53

PAGE 2 OF 4 PAGES

1. At 0550Â½, 26 February 1953, an unidentified radar sighting on the OA Planned Position Indicator (PPI) Scope was reported to this office and the Group Intelligence Officer. As soon as the observing personnel could be contacted, interrogations were made. The information obtained is related below.

2. During the above time, S/Sgt George Smith, Team Chief, and S/Sgt K. T. Lucas, a GCA Operator, and A/2D Glaxicon, Mechanic were the GCA duty team on this installation. At this time, they were monitoring a MATS C-124, that was on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern preparing to land at Thule Air Base. The aircraft had aborted from a return flight to Westover due to mechanical troubles and was returning to Thule.

3. S/Sgt Lucas while tracking the C-124h on his scope at a position approximately 4 1/2 miles NE of the base, noticed a prominent blip some 7 cm in size from the clutter area of the scope (the clutter area is within a 3 1/2 mile radius of the GCA installation) outbound on a grid heading of 270 degrees, four miles NW (true bearing) from the station.

4. The unidentified sighting was tracked for a distance of three miles before it faded from the scope at a distance of approximately 160 knots or better by the GCA controllers. Altitude of the unidentified could not be determined although in order to pass in view of the scope, it is believed to be above 700 feet and under 6000 feet, the scope's operating limitations.

5. In the interrogation, it was determined that if the object had remained at a constant altitude under 6000 feet, it would have been in view of the scope for approximately 14 miles, the maximum radius of the equipment. The fact that the unidentified passed out of the scope at seven miles indicated that it was in a climbing attitude and passed out of the scope at some altitude. If the object had passed directly over the base, its track would not have been indicated on the PPI scope due to normal ground clutter. Its track if it approached the base was not indicated on the PPI scope.

6. The MATS C-124, which was on the downwind leg of the traffic at the time of the sighting, had approached the field on a grid heading of 025 degrees while landing. The aircraft passed over the center of the field at an altitude of 4000 feet on the above heading and upon reaching the north side of Thule Air Base turned into the downwind leg of the traffic pattern on a grid heading of 350 degrees. The C-124h had been on the downwind leg for approximately six miles when the sighting was picked up on the scope. The intensity of the blip of the C-124h and the object was approximately the same. (The C-124h is to the large size given a large and very prominent blip reflection). The speed of the unidentified as reported by GCA personnel was slightly faster than that of the C-124h. The C-124h traffic pattern speed approximately 150 knots). The crew of the C-124h were advised of the tracking of the unidentified object, but did not see anything. ACGW did not paint the unidentified sighting nor did they pick up any inbound or outbound unknowns on their scopes at any time during the mission.

and others could give unusual indications on radar scopes in rather strange patterns.

Inasmuch as the weather conditions coupled with the facts that AOSS had no indications of the sighting, discrepancies noted in the interrogation of C-124 personnel, the fact that the C-124 crew did not notice any indication of the phenomena, leaves this office to believe that the sighting was attributed to a reflection of a metal object.
