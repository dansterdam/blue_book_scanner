SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Recovered at
RAF Station Mildenhall, England, 26 April 1954
SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters, United States Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

1. The following information and attached photographs, are being forwarded to your office for any action deemed necessary.

2. On 26 April 1954 Captain HENCGE, 1st Lt JOHNSON, Assistant Provost Marshal, 3rd Base Group, RAF Station Mildenhall, AFO 127, US Air Force, advised United Kingdom District OSI that Special Agents WILLIAM J. SCARBOROUGH and WILLIAM HAGEN, 5K District, that a spherical object had been recovered adjacent to the Base and was being retained at Base Operations.

An initial inquiry at Base Operations revealed the object to be a hollow aluminum sphere, approximately sixteen inches (16") in diameter, and weighing approximately six (6) ounces. Attached to the sphere was a coarse piece of fabric approximately five feet by five feet (5' x 5') which was suspended by pieces of binders twine to the object. Piece of a ruptured balloon were attached to the fabric. No identifying markings were noted on the sphere other than the word "HARMLESS" printed in yellow grease pencil on the side. The trademark "Made in England" appeared on a portion of the balloon. The object was first seen at approximately 1600 hours on 26 April 1954 floating to earth. It landed in a tree close to the base in the area of Air Installation Section.

Captain THOMPSON made several telephone calls throughout the United Kingdom in an attempt to have the object identified. Special Agent SCARBOROUGH made a telephone call to Special Investigations Branch, Royal Air Force, RAF Station Dunford, Cambridgeshire, at which time he spoke to the Duty Officer concerning the object.

The Duty Officer assured Special Agent SCARBOROUGH that the object

did not come from RAF Station Dunford but that he would make further inquiries in an attempt to determine the origin of the object. The Duty Officer agreed to notify this office in the event it was determined where the object came from. Several people contacted expressed the opinion that the object had been used for tracking purposes by a radar station.

3. No investigation concerning this matter was requested by the Commander, 5910th Air Base Group, RAF Station Mildenhall.
