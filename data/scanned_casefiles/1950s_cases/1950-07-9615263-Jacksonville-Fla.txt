Object Like Flying Saucer
Seen by Courthouse Group

A half hundred Courthouse employees and as many passers-by were convinced yesterday they at last had joined the growing ranks of those who have seen a "flying saucer."

Scores of persons gathered on the Forsyth Street side of the county building about 3:45 P.M. yesterday to speculate upon the nature of a shiny aluminum "pin-point" clearly seen in the blue sky. The object was too high for any of its features to be distinguished, except that it apparently was round. There was nothing comparative to measure its size, although while the crowd watched two jet planes passed well beneath it and their wing span seemed about twice the diameter of the sphere.

Cooperative spectators suggested the object might have been a large weather observatory balloon. It apparently hovered in one spot, literally, while slowly drifting upward until it disappeared from view.

The object emitted no fiery jets and no noise of any kind was heard from it. But a hundred people went back about their workaday tasks saying "Well, in the last five seen a 'flying saucer.'"

MIAMI HERALD, 13 July 1950

Now They Roar Loudly

Jaxons Awakened By Flying Saucers
By United Press

JACKSONVILLE â€” A roar coming from the sky early Wednesday awoke a number of Jacksonville residents and raised the cry, "flying saucers."

Jacksonville Journal reporter Tom Veverka was among the first to report the incident. She said she saw three objects moving at "slow speed" high in the air over the city.

"They were glowing from beneath with violet flashes forming short comet tails," she said, "and were wavering up and down like gramophone discs on uneven centers."

Joe Noll, announcer at radio station WMBR, said he saw three of the objects at 4 a. m., "flashing a red light, flying concentric circles at about 15,000 feet."

Still another report said the objects were moving "like a ball of fire."

Consensus among those who saw the objects was that they were between 20 and 30 feet in diameter.

The military services repeatedly have denied knowledge of "flying saucers"

If You Ever Had Even a Wavering Doubt;
This Kills It; There Are Flying Saucers
By TONI VIVIERA
Maybe what I saw this morning
wasn't a flying saucer - it was
something different. And I have a
witness.

That something flew over the
Riverside area.

In all happened about 6 a.m., during the half way between night and
day which was Floridians call "the
twilight."

The morning was shocked into full awareness by a tremendous roar, quite unlike that
of several bombers. In that it lacked
that steady sound. Nor was it like
the whine of a streaking jet.

Like the man in "The Night Before Christmas" I jumped to the
window to see what was the matter.

Golden light. The machine carried
no running lights. It didn't need
them.

The entire object seemed outlined at a remote height) with a glow
that surged with each increase of
the roar. It increased and diminished at a rate something like one
would count one-two-three-pause;
one-two-three-pause.

As it passed, I could see violent and great flashes spurting into a short comet's tail.
Viewed from the rear, and in the
growing light, the thing seemed to
waver in an up and down movement, similar to that of a gramophone disc on an uneven center.

Far to the northwestward the machine apparently objected to a
sweeping curve and returned as

though making a great sweeping stamp of approval.

Then started my vigil by the window. If there had been one, may be
it would return - or there might be
more.

The watch was rewarded in about
15 minutes. Only this time the thing was much higher. It followed
the approximate course of the first
visitor.

After another 15 minutes, a third
came.

After seeing three of the early
morning visitors, it was easy to imagine the words may be full of them.
One thing is certain! It is no
inter-planetary machine. It is bound
to have made in America stamp
on it.

Its apparent perfection also indicates it carries the Good Housekeeping stamp of approval.
