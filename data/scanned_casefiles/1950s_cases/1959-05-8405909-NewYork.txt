UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: New York

Date: 2 May 1959     Hour (2): 2345 and 0106

WX: Cloud overcast, wind 15 knots.

Description: Three reports (1) Two drop source, slightly dispersed with darkness. In sight 45 minutes. (2) Squarish at first, then round, size of dollar, bluish-white, moving in southwest direction. In sight 30 minutes. (3) Year and no local comments but moving within 5 mile radius of Bradley Field. Permanent fade out after one hour at altitude.

Visual Witness Indicates: A motion erratically south, direction of motion various as documented, indicates or east movement.

Satellites: (AFOIN-143, Phone 69219) Queried - no data on more than one place.

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): None out.

Radar Analysis (AFOIN-141): None sighted. No unusual data available.

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): 

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Possibly observed

Other:

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probably good.

Analysis and Conclusions: The argus pilot indicates that the object was moving south. If this object was a balloon as evidence indicates its velocity would mostly have resulted from its relative motion to the aircraft which was narrow north. The radar sightings which took place up to one plus sightings which took place up to one plus.


- page 8 -

Holders later saw the object eastward by approximately 50 nautical miles. This information and the reported wind velocity of approximately 40 K and toward the northeast tend to substantiate the balloon conclusion.

The ATC conclusion is that the object of this sighting was probably a balloon.
