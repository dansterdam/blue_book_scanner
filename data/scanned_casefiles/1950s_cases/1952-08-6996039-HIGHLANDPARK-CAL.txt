Aug. 17th at about six P.M. my sister and her husband, my husband and two daughters, a little neighbor girl and my self were standing in the front yard when one of us happened to look up into the sky and we sighted a round white object very high in the sky. We called our next door neighbors who were out in their yard at the time also and we all stood watching it. Suddenly we saw another one near it. We saw them clearly for a few seconds, then one disappeared and in about 15 or 20 seconds later - the other one also disappeared. They were very high toward center of sky, set, and silvery and luminous. We all saw them definitely not air planes.
