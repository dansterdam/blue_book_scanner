DATE: June 12, 1957

We were driving home from dinner at Great Oak Lodge on the Chesapeake Bay, just being the [illegible] and happily; when my son remarked "Boy, what are those lights!" We looked out of the left side of the car to see what appeared as twelve or fourteen lights hanging just over the trees with a red light at each end of the arch of lights. Also could see no mass that would support these but then it was pitch dark and we judged the lights to be over "Wharton's Creek" which was about 1/2 mile away. We discussed the fact that there was no house or structure to hold such a mass of lights. We drove down a dirt road to try and get closer but it only resulted in having the lights get lost among the tree tops. We could still see them and turned the car motor off to see if we could hear anything. But there was no sound that would apply to a plane or blimps or motor. We started up again as we turned around and the lights simply went out. We watched for their return but there was none. These lights were white lights like large street lamps in an oval pattern, about 12 or 14, and two side lights on a slant east. It seemed to me that 2 of the lights on the left (front) side definitely seemed rays horizontal. The others were just lights.


- page 13 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Page 10

There was no pulsation of any of the lights and they did not move separately or together. This group of lights seemed to me to be about ½ mile away each could not have been more than 200 feet off the ground. In the area over which it moved, to be observable there is a wharf or a small creek surrounded by fields, woods with a rise of the land not more than 70 ft high. However my guesstimate of distance at night is not accurate. So the best of my ability the group of lights resolved this form of my ability with two dark bands representing the red lights.

There was no change in intensity of the lights through the two lights on the end seemed definitely to leave their light down. We were driving most of the time we were watching it, but it did not appear to move.

[There is also a hand-drawn sketch of the lights in the middle of the document]

CHESTERTOWN, MARYLAND
INCIDENT

24 May 1957

(Sighting by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (US Army))

Newspaper accounts of flying saucers in the vicinity of Chestertown Maryland were given sudden significance when a high-level member of the Department of Defense, Mr. [redacted] and his family observed a series of strange, weird-appearing lighted objects floating in the dark moonless sky, over the Chesapeake Bay, on the night of 24 May 1957 from the grounds of his home near Chestertown, Maryland.

Upon reporting the sightings to the Air Force, an investigation was immediately undertaken. Mr. [redacted] was interviewed in the Pentagon, and a thorough check made of the area in question, with detailed testimony from the other members of the [redacted] family and other witnesses to the sightings.

An analysis of weather conditions at the time of the sighting ruled out meteorological-created phenomena. Radar units records disclosed nothing unusual in the sky at that time. A check with air activities, both military and civil shed little light. The area was photographed for clues.

While interviewing fishermen near a wharf, suddenly a clue was found. A fisherman remembered the time and date of the event, because a brush fire occurred nearby when the phenomena was taking place.

Further investigations, as a result, disclosed that the source of the phenomena was from the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, which are located Northwest across the bay.

B.   FACTUAL DATA

2. Travel commenced on 11 June 1957 and terminated 16 June 1957.

3. Travel was performed by M/Sgt Oliver D. Hill, Air Sciences Division, ATIC-MDL, acting in the capacity of UFO Investigator.

4. Names of persons contacted for interview, interrogation and/or information regarding the UFO sighting in question:

a. Mr. [redacted] Pentagon, Washington, D.C.
b. Mrs. [redacted] Washington, D.C.
c. Master [redacted] Maryland

e. Capt Cunnon, Flight 3D, 46021 AISS, Washington, D.C.
f. Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen, Maryland

5. Travel for the purpose stated was approved after submission of all pertinent facts, and reasons for recommending this investigation.

6. The following is a summary of the case investigated, statement regarding results, opinions, impressions, and other pertinent highlights of the interviews and interrogations regarding subject UFO case.

a. Interview with Mr. [redacted] Office Assistant Secretary of Defense (U.S. Army) Washington, D.C.

(1) Mr. [redacted] received the undersigned in his office at the Pentagon on the afternoon of 12 June 1957 where he gave a full and clear account of the UFO sighting that he, in the company of his wife and 14 year old son, had made on the night of Friday, 24 May 1957 at 2145 hours EDT. Mr. [redacted] agreed at this time to fill out AF Form 164 as completely as possible for the information and analysis.

CHESTERTOWN, MARYLAND
INCIDENT

24 May 1957

It was determined that the Aberdeen Proving Grounds were giving
an aerial demonstration involving aircraft, flash bombs and parachute
flares for visiting West Point Cadets on the night of the incident.


- page 34 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

by AMIC. Mr. also stated that he "was sure no had
been something, but didn't know what it was." It was then
arranged to have an interview with Mrs. in the following
morning at the Washington residence. Mr. took
an extra AF Form 164 for Mrs. to complete.

b. Interview with Mrs. in Washington, D.C.

(1) Mrs. in substance gave the same account of subject
sighting as her husband, and submitted the completed AF
Form 164. Mrs. and the undersigned had approximately
an hour's discussion on the subject of UFO's and various
writers who have published books on the UFO's. Mrs.
stated she was positive they had seen an unusual object,
but was of the firm opinion that it was man-made and
nothing of an extraterrestrial nature.

c. Interview with at 14 years old, at Wharton Creek
a few miles from Chestertown, Maryland.

(1) gave in substance the same account of the sight-
ing as had been given by his mother and father, and com-
pleted AF Form 164. He then agreed to take the under-
signed to the exact location of the sighting. This was
accomplished and photographs were taken of the area and
then accompanied the undersigned to Wharton Creek.

d. Interviews with seven persons at Wharton Creek Pier and Boat House.

(1) These people did not give their names or addresses but as
they all either work at the pier or are fishermen there,
they would be available in the future if it should be
necessary to interrogate them again.

(2) It was while interviewing these individuals that the only
reasonable solution was arrived at. These seven persons
all remembered the time and date as given by the family
and this event was vivid in their minds because of a brush
fire which occurred a few minutes after the sighting was
made; they all had seen the phenomenon and all agreed that
the cause of the sighting was an experiment from Aberdeen
Proving Grounds, which is located to the Northeast across
the creek or sound from the boat house. All seven stated
that they had in the past observed such experiments quite
often. None of these people completed AF Form 164, but
several forms were left with them at their request. The
owner and operator of this boat house was most cooperative
and helpful, and stated that if he could be of any help in
the future to call on him personally.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

e. Capt Cunnion, Commander, Flight 3D, 4602d AISS, Andrews AFB,
Washington, D.C.

(1) Capt Cunnion was contacted and the purpose of the under-
signed's mission was explained. Capt Cunnion agreed that
he would get all the weather and radar information for the
period 210 to 2270 hours, 24 May 1957 and dispatch it to
ATIC. However, on Friday 24 June 1957 Capt Cunnion was
again contacted by phone and a verbal account of weather
and radar were given no follow-up weather, clear, dry and
cool-winds 15 to 2 mile per hour. There was no moon,
only a few stars visible.

(2) A U.S. Army site which was the nearest point to the sight-
ing was with near gave a negative report for the period
indicated above.

f. Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen, Maryland.

(1) A request was sent to the Commanding General, Aberdeen
Proving Ground, for all available information concerning
any activities taking place at the base on the night of
24 May 1957 to be forwarded to ATIC. At 1430 hours
27 June 1957 in a telephone conversation between Col.
Desens, Operations Officer, US Air Force at Aberdeen
Proving Ground, Maryland, and undersigned, it was determined
by review of records that on the night of 24 May and 25 May
1957 between 9:30 and 10:30 PM EDT that an aerial
Demonstration involving B-26s took place over the area of
Wheaton Creek, Maryland, and that World War II parachute
flares were dropped. Verification of this demonstration
is contained in Inclosure #2 of this report.

c. CONCLUSION

7. Based on all the information obtained from this investigation, it
appears certain that this sighting was caused by an experiment or test of
certain types of flares by the U.S. Army and that they originated from
Aberdeen Proving Ground, which is located near the subject sighting.

D. RECOMMENDATION

9. That the UFO case investigated herein be entered in the UFO case file
under the category of CINE(Flares) of unusual nature.
