NAME ___[Redacted]___
SIGNATURE ___[Redacted]___
DATE __June 12, 1957__

We were driving home from dinner at Priet Cote Lodge on the Chesapeake Bay, feeling high-spirited and happy, when from somewhere a saucer-like disc lightened color suddenly it raised near and with a speed appeared as boardless light orangey that over the trees with a red jelly at each end of the oval. It circled near as near that would approach than find that it was quite dark and we judged the heights to be over "hundreds feet" working around 2 miles away. We discussed to fail that there were no other reflective or readable car on a mean of lights. Was driven down a dirt road to key and get elese that it only resulted in having the lights get lost amongst the trees. The cords still in chase returned the car most of the leg we could....Then suddenly...it, there was no seems that turned apt to a flaw in driving on roads. We walked up road as we turned around the lights simply went out. We watched for their return....And there were none. These lighters were with lights like huge star-carrying in an arched pattern, almost 12 or 14, and two red lights on either end. It seemed to us that a deffo ufo(s) on the left(and) One definitely learned many fromward. The others were just lights.


- page 13 -

There is no photograph in this image, but there is a hand-sketched illustration depicting multiple lights in the sky, with two darker objects which seem to represent the red lights.

The text from the document reads:

---
Page 10

There was no pulsation of any of the lights and they did not move separately or together. This group of lights seemed to be about ½ mile away but could not have been more than 300 feet off the ground. In the area over which it seemed to be suspended there is a wheat or a small creek surrounded by fields, woods and a hill that rises not more than 70 ft high. This may yield a distance as night – not accurate. In the tail a my artist’s rendering of lights resembled this form with the two dark bold representing the red lights.

There was no change in intensity of the lights though the two lights on the end seemed definitely to throw their light down. We were driving near (t) the time we were watching it, and it did not appear to move.

The image does not contain any photographs; instead, it features a technical drawing of a hemispherical dome with labeled angles and directions. It includes markings for degrees from 0 to 90 at the zenith, with horizontal lines intersecting at 30°, 60°, and 90° intervals. The compass directions such as South (180°), Southeast (135°), East (90°), etc., are indicated around the base of the dome along with degrees. The perimeter has small figures, possibly representing trees and one human figure standing at the left side at the 270° W mark.

CHESTERTOWN, MARYLAND
INCIDENT

24 May 1957

(Sighting by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (US Army))

Newspaper accounts of flying saucers in the vicinity of Chestertown Maryland were given sudden significance when a high-level member of the Department of Defense, Mr. ██████████ and his family observed a series of strange, weird-appearing lighted objects floating in the dark moonless sky, over the Chesapeake Bay, on the night of 24 May 1957 from the grounds of his home near Chestertown, Maryland.

Upon reporting the sightings to the Air Force, an investigation was immediately undertaken, Mr. ██████████ was interviewed in the Pentagon, and a thorough check made of the area in question, with detailed testimony from the other members of the ██████ family and other witnesses to the sightings.

An analysis of weather conditions at the time of the sighting ruled out meteorological-created phenomena. Radar units records disclosed nothing unusual in the sky at that time. A check with air activities, both military and civil shed little light. The area was photographed for clues.

While interviewing fishermen near a wharf, suddenly a clue was found. A fisherman remembered the time and date of the event, because a brush fire occurred nearby when the phenomena was taking place.

Further investigations, as a result, disclosed that the source of the phenomena was from the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, which are located Northwest across the bay.

**Transcription of the text from the document:**

by AITC. Mr. **** also stated that he "was sure he had
seen something but didn't know what it was." It was then
arranged to have an interview with Mrs. **** the following
morning at her **** Washington residence. Mr **** took
an extra AF Form #164 for Mrs. **** to complete.

b. Interview with Mrs. ****, ****, Washington, D.C.

   (1) Mrs. **** in substance gave the same account of subject
sighting as her husband, and submitted the completed AF
Form #164. Mrs. **** and the undersigned had approximately
an hour's discussion on the subject of UFO's and various
writers who have published books on the UFO's. Mrs. ****
stated she was positive they had seen an unusual object
but was of the firm opinion that it was man-made and
nothing of an extraterrestrial nature.

c. Interview with ****, 14 years old, at Wharton Creek,
a few miles from Chestertown, Maryland.

   (1) **** gave in substance the same account of the sight-
ing as had been given by his mother and father, and com-
pleted AF Form #164. He then agreed to take the under-
signed to the exact location of the sighting. This was
accomplished and photographs were taken of the area.
**** then accompanied the undersigned to Wharton Creek.

d. Interviews with seven persons at Wharton Creek Pier and Boat House.

   (1) These people did not give their names or addresses but as
they all either work at the pier or are fishermen there,
they would be available in the future if it should be
necessary to interrogate them again.

   (2) It was while interviewing these individuals that the only
reasonable solution was arrived at. These ten persons
all remembered the time and date as given by ****,
and this event was vivid in their minds because of a brush
Fire which occurred a few minutes after the sighting was
made; they all had seen the phenomenon and all agreed that
the cause of the sighting was an experiment from Aberdeen
Proving Grounds, which is located to the Northwest across
the creek or sound from the boat house. All seven stated
that they had in the past observed such experiments quite
often. None of these people completed AF Form #164 but
several forms were left with them at their requests. The
owner and operator of this boat house was not cooperative
and helpful, and stated that if he could be of any help in
the future to call on him personally.

   again contacted by phone and a verbatim account of weather
   and radar were given as follows: weather, clear, dry and
   cool; wind NW @ 10 miles per hour. There was no moon,
   only a few stars visible.

(2) A U.S. Army site which was the nearest point to the sight-
   ing area with radar gave a negative report for the period
   indicated above.

f. Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen, Maryland.

(1) A request was sent to the Commanding General, Aberdeen
   Proving Ground, for all available information concerning
   any activities taking place at the base on the night of
    24 May 1957 to be forwarded to AITC. At 1830 hours
    27 June 1957 in a telephone conversation between Col.
    Desens, Operations Officer, US Air Force & Aberdeen
    Proving Ground, Maryland, and undersigned, it was determined
    by review of records that on the night of 24 and 25 May
    1957 between 9:30 and 10:30 PM EDT that an aerial
    demonstration involving B-26s took place over the area of
    Whaton Creek, Maryland; and that World War II parachute
    flares were dropped. Verification of this demonstration
    is contained in Inclosure #2 of this report.
    AND FLASH BOMBS

c. CONCLUSION

7. Based on all the information obtained from this investigation, it
   appears certain that this sighting was caused by an experiment or test of
   certain types of flares by the U.S. army and that they originated from
   Aberdeen Proving Ground, which is located near the subject sightings.

D. RECOMMENDATION

e. That the UFO case investigated herein be entered in the UFO case file
   under the category of OTHER,(Flares) of unusual nature.
