SUMMARY: (Enter brief summary of report. Give significant facts in final one-sentence paragraph. List witnesses in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part II.)

At approximately 2145 hours (local time) 4 February 1953, Captain Robert S. Gleason noticed an object overhead traveling at a very high rate of speed. Its altitude could not be accurately estimated but appeared to be very high. The object appeared very small from the ground but was slightly large than a star. Captain Gleason could not estimate its size because its altitude was unknown. The object was colorless and gave off a white glow as it passed overhead on a course due west. Before it dropped over the horizon, it veered to the northwest, gaining altitude. It then dropped out of sight.

Approximately one minute later another object of the same description appeared on the same course. The second object continued on a course due west, then dropped over the horizon. During these sightings Captain Gleason described the weather as perfectly clear, visibility unlimited, with sighting was in view for approximately 15 seconds.

These sightings were witnessed and confirmed by 1st Lt. Joseph A. Pichler and 1st Lt. Laurance H. Duval Jr., both Air Force Officers. (Captain Gleason and Lt. Duval, rated personnel). Sightings were made by the naked eye. The observers were located on the ground at the northern section of Maxwell Air Force Base.
