COMMENTS OF Preparing Officer:
In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused by a low flying aircraft.

The Investigator on two occasions on the night of 6 Aug 56, from his home in Smyrna, Georgia, observed a light in the sky which he believed to be an unidentified flying object.

a. The place of sighting by the source was in a location where it was possible the source could have observed aircraft traffic. Therefore, the 15 degree elevation of the object above the horizon. The reports would be true of the object disappearing.

b. The fact that the source did not hear any noise from the object to identify it as a normal aircraft. In this connection, because of the distance involved, normal aircraft engines in operation may have actually been longer as source only estimated the time.

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer:
Concur with opinion of Preparing Officer that sighting was probably caused by an aircraft.

WHEREAS REPORT HAS BEEN MADE ON A FLYING OBJECT OBSERVED NEAR SMYRNA, GEORGIA, ON THE EVENING OF 15 JUNE 1956, AND A SUFFICIENT DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT AND ITS BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THIS OFFICE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE CASE BE CLASSIFIED AS UNIDENTIFIED.
THE WITNESSES DESCRIBE THE OBJECT AS OVAL IN SHAPE AND APPROXIMATELY 60 TO 80 FEET IN LENGTH. IT APPEARED TO BE ILLUMINATED FROM WITHIN AND SEEMED TO EXHIBIT SOME SORT OF PULSATING OR FLASHING EFFECT. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE A RAPID UPWARD CLIMB AND THEN LEVEL OFF AT AN ALTITUDE ESTIMATED TO BE 1,000 FEET OR MORE. AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THE OBJECT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED.
ALTHOUGH SEVERAL FACTORS COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED, SUCH AS THE TRUE SIZE, SPEED AND ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT, IT IS FELT THAT THE REPORT CONTAINS SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO WARRANT CLASSIFICATION AS UNIDENTIFIED IN VIEW OF THE INABILITY TO EXPLAIN THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA IN CONVENTIONAL TERMS. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS CASE BE CLOSED.

On the night of July 6, 1956, while playing outside, the source observed a bright, steady light in the sky which he described as being larger and brighter than any stars in the sky. The light appeared to be moving across the sky in a northerly direction. After observing the light for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, it suddenly disappeared. The source stated that he has observed similar lights on several previous occasions in the same general area, but never for such a long period of time as on this particular night.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
JUNK FILE, SUBJECT; 3-UP, 46024 ATBS PERIOD OF REPORT: 20-10J0B-22-56 PART THREE OF 5
SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:
INQUIRY INTO REPORTED SIGHTING. DEBRING AIR FORCE BASE. ON 11 JULY 1956.
Debbing the Debring Air Force Base sighted 6 lights which they stated might account for the sighting reported in the ATBS of 20-10J0B-22-56. These lights were stationary and observed over a period of time. Other lights were a stationary spot.
The control tower chief of operations reported no radar tracks in the area of the sighting but at this time the radar operator was checking the weather. A check with the ADC 26th AI RS, ISS SSGT (USAF) revealed no GOROB or other returns from the vicinity at the time.
Debring ATS revealed that the weather instrument operator reported no unusual activity. Debbing ATC reported that the reception there was no cloud coverage - a slight haze prevailed at the altitude at which the lights were observed.
Investigator was unable to contact the Bradley Observatory, Decatur, GA, as it was closed for the summer.
