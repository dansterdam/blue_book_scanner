GENERAL INTELLIGENCE REPORT

FROM (AGENCY)                 REPORT NO. 20-UFOB-2-56     PART FOUR
FLY 2-C, 4602d AISS                                       PAGE 5 OF 5 PAGES

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused
by a low flying aircraft for the following reasons:

    a. The Investigator on two occasions on the night of 6 Aug 56, from his
    home in Smyrna, Georgia, witnessed similar sightings caused by low flying aircraft
    which traveled this course as approximated.

    b. The place of sighting by the Source was in a location where it was
    impossible to see the true horizon because of houses and trees. Therefore the 15
    degrees above the north horizon as reported by the Source was actually closer to
    45 degrees above the horizon. The same would be true of the object disappearing
    over the south horizon.

    c. The fact that the Source did not hear any noise from the object to
    identify it as an aircraft was probably because of the Smyrna, Georgia Lockheed
    Aircraft Corporation where continuous testing of aircraft engines is being
    accomplished.

    d. The 60 second duration of the sighting as reported by the Source,
    may have actually been longer as Source only estimated the time.

                                                    Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with opinion of Preparing Officer that sighting was probably caused
by an aircraft.

The document appears to be a military or government report, likely related to an aircraft sighting, but the full details cannot be clearly read.

     Well known to the Investigator as his father considers him to be generally reliable.

II.  DETAILS OF SIGHTING: At 01/0152 Aug 56, Source and his friend were sitting in the yard observing the stars. At this time they watched the North Star when the object appeared and he called his friend's attention to it. The object was approximately twice the size of the North Star, round, and white in color. Some compared the object to an incandescent-light's great distance. The object traveled from an elevation of 15 degrees to 90 degrees in 60 seconds. Source was fairly certain of the time. When the object passed overhead, it was about 60 degrees in elevation. The object did not change color or shape, pulsate, throb, give off smoke, break up or explode, and the speed remained the same during the sighting. Some stated that during the sighting there were many stars shining, there were no clouds or wind, and no aircraft visible to him. Source was certain the object was not a "Shooting Star" as he had observed these before.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Plt 2-q, 1602d ATSS                    20-UTOB-2-56                    PART THREE

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with Base Operations, Dobbins Air Force Base, in regard to lights then visible in the night account for the sighting, revealed that the revolving beacon light installed at Dobbins directs a light parallel to the surface and is would be "milky" for the beacon to throw a pattern as described by the source. Other lights throw a stationary spot.

2. A check with the 86lst NORAD, Alken, S.C. revealed no record of radar traces or aircraft sightings but at this time the radar operators were busy tracking aircraft in the immediate area.

3. A check with the D/F, 35th Air Dir (Def) revealed numerous UFO sightings reported during the period 30 Jul 56 to 2 Aug 56. However, none of these sightings coincided with this sighting.

4. A check with the Weather Detachment, Dobbins AFB, revealed that the weather and winds aloft reported by the source were correct with the exception that there was no cloud coverage. A slight haze prevailed at the time of sighting which would have caused the stars or a light to look fuzzy.

5. Investigator was unable to contact the Bradley Observatory, Decatur, Georgia as time closed for the summer.
