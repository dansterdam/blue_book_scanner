2nd Lt. W. Lualam Jr., Asst Intel Officer

At 11:05 P.M., 2 February 1953, two (2) gunners on a B-50 type aircraft observed what appeared to be a silver ball in the wake of a B-50 type aircraft. They attempted to obtain pictures of this ball with their J.A.A.G. cameras but subsequent film assessment failed to show conclusive evidence of this object. [This film from the summary cameras has been forwarded under separate cover to Chief, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFS, Dayton, Ohio.]

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Castle AF Base, California

1. Description of Object: The observers, Central Fire Control gunner and right waist gunner on a B-50 type aircraft, noted a silver object in the wake of a B-50 type aircraft while they were under most attack by F-84 type aircraft during a routine training mission. Their observation indicated the object as a silver call with possible flat surfaces evidenced by variations in reflection characteristics, whereas, the other observed lateral is more like a disc which first showed its circular side then its flat side. The object's apparent diameter was three (3) feet and its distance from the observers was estimated at twenty (20) miles. Two tall appeared to remain stationary during the entire sighting. The object made no audible sound.

2. Time: Sighting began at 1100 hours, 12 February 1953, and the object remained in view for approximately three (3) minutes thereafter.

3. Manner of Observation: The observation was made visually from the Central Fire Control gunner's position on top, the fuselage and from the right gunner's ability to see the right side of the fuselage of a B-50 type aircraft the only means of sighting the object.

4. Location: The observers were airborne at the time of sighting. The aircraft was on a heading of 237 degrees and was in the vicinity of Victorville, California (approx. 34°N 117°W). The object was observed at 350 degrees, 40,000 feet in altitude, and approximately twenty (20) miles distant.

5. Observers:
a. Technical Sergeant CARL V. EDWARDS, USAF, the Central Fire Control gunner, has fifty (50) hours flying time and has been in the Air Force for seven (7) years. He is presently attached to the 330th Bombardment Squadron, 94th Bombardment Wing (H), Castle AF Base, California. He has not previously observed unidentified flying objects.

b. Staff Sergeant KENNETH S. JUBIN, USAF, the right gunner on the same crew as Edwards, has been on flying status since April 1950 and has flown sixty (60) combat missions. His total time in the service has been five and one half (5½) years. Sergeant Jubin has no previous sightings of unidentified flying objects.

6. Weather Conditions: Clear skies, with winds for the position being from 120 across at approximately twenty-five (25) knots.

7. Related Activities or Conditions: The navigator of this crew after extensive evaluation smoked one to two cigarettes and stated that while the object sighted was a large plastic balloon or two small balloons have been found in this vicinity, these California AFB approximately twenty-five (25) miles from this location will be helpful in clarifying this sighting. It is also very possible that another report which will substantiate this sighting will be submitted by one of the other aircraft crews which were in this area at the time. Local attachments will be made to obtain further substantiation.

9. Immediate Interception or Identification Action: None Known.

10. Simultaneous Air Traffic:
    a. Six (6) F-89 type aircraft. Four (4) were making passes on the observed
    aircraft from various angles and were flying between 16,000 and 25,000 feet.
    Appeared to be tracking the by-passing L-52 type aircraft. One F-89 was tracking a
    delta wing aircraft, which was also in the vicinity.

    b. One (1) Delta wing (later believed to be a Convair F-102 or F-102A was
    identified) from George AFB, at 1530 at approximately five thousand (5,000) knots.
    The approximate rate of descent was a 1,000 feet per minute. The aircraft's main
    course of ninety (90) degrees. Its color was white and the time of observation was
    1150, 57.

    c. One (1) F-89 type aircraft. This aircraft was first observed at 1606
    hours, at an altitude of 40,000 feet, with a speed of F-89 hundred (650) knots, and
    on a course of ninety (30) degrees. The unidentified object was observed in the
    wake of this aircraft.

Carl Y. Edwards                 IR-9-53           T/Sgt.

At 1900, CDT, 2 February 1953, I was in the CPC gunner's position of a B-50 type aircraft, Number 9365, flying at an altitude of 25,000 feet. I was searching for fighter attacks from F-86 type aircraft which were in the area. I saw a B-52 type aircraft at three (3) o'clock high.

As this aircraft passed, I noticed a silver object in its wake. I called on the interphone, "Does anyone see that silver object behind that B-52?"

I was answered by my right gunner saying, "Yes". Neither one of us could identify the object. We both took gun camera pictures to confirm the sighting.

The object looked alike a silver disk, first showing its circular side and then the flat side. It first appeared high at three (3) o'clock and was left high at four-thirty (4:30). I watched until it went out of sight.

STATEMENT
ICP-53 UNCLASSIFIED
Kenneth B. Juelks A-16233259 S/Sgt.

At 1900, CDT, 2 February 1953, I was occupying the right gunner's position of B-50 type aircraft No. 9365 on a routine training mission. During this period we were under a simulated attack from four (4) F-86 type fighter aircraft from George AFB, Victorville, California. I was searching for fighters in my assigned quadrant when a large jet aircraft leaving four contrails appeared at three (3) o'clock high crossing over course to nine (3) o'clock. As I observed this aircraft, I noticed a silver ball off the right wing. The ball was stationary and we left it behind at six (6) o'clock. Total time for this observation was about three (3) minutes. The ball appeared to be made of polished metal, silver or chrome. It appeared to be small, and due to this fact I could not notice any flat surfaces.

During the sighting I took two sequences of pictures with my G.S.A.F. camera. On the first sequence I turned the reticle out so that only the object remained. In the second sequence I turned the reticle on and placed the center dot on the left side of the object.
