Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

• THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the western sky after sunset is Venus, reaching its greatest prominence, which continues until the disappearance from the evening sky early in 1958.

Venus is far brighter than any other star or planet seen in the night sky and there is an "altitude" in brightness that can be observed long before the sky is dark.

Venus has gradually been drawing to the east of the sun's west point and has followed the sun in its daily motion across the sky. After sunset, Venus will be the first bright object to catch the sun's last glow. On Nov. 18 it will be at its greatest brilliancy, rising in the sky for the longest time after sunset, nearly three hours. After that it will start moving toward the sun again.

Venus does not appear on the accompanying maps of the November evening skies, which show its appearance about 10:30 p.m., four own charts will mark Venus on the 15th and 8:00 p.m. on the 16th.

Bright Birds in the Sky
These maps, however, do show the stars that are now visible.

Toward the west is Deneb, at the top of the "northern cross," which is really part of the constellation of Cygnus, the swan. Deneb is in the bird's tail; in fact, the word "Arabic" and means "tail." The crosspiece represents the wings, and the lower part of the cross his long neck, stretched forward in light. At the head is Albireo, a star of the second magnitude on the astronomical brightness scale. Below Cygnus is another first-magnitude star, Vega, in Lyra, the lyre.

To the left is another bird, Aquila, the eagle, with the star Altair, high in the south you can see the four stars that form the "great square" part of the constellation of Pegasus, the winged horse. Although these are not among the brightest, their characteristic arrangement makes them a good starting place from which to find other groups. The horse, actually, is inside down in the sky, as the row of stars extending westward from the lower right corner of the square is his head.

Turning now toward the east, we can see what is generally considered to be the first constellation in the sky making its debut for the season.

Orient Season's Finest
This is Orion, the warrior, easily recognized because of the three stars in a row that form his belt. To the left is Betelgeuse, to the right is Rigel, both of the first magnitude, although being not so low in the sky they do not appear as bright as they will in the coming month.

The star chart includes two circular star maps showing the night sky in November 1957, with constellations and star positions marked. At the bottom of the page, there is a small legend showing "Symbols for Stars in Order of Brightness".

The article discusses the visibility of Venus, the upcoming Leonid meteor shower, and provides a detailed description of various constellations and stars visible in the November night sky.

No Case (Information Only)                                9 November 1957
                                                                   Fargo, North Dakota

At Fargo, North Dakota, Fargo Forum photographer Alf T. Olsen saw and photographed a "cigar-shaped object" which hovered for several minutes about noon on November 9th. He was able to get three shots, one of which shows two additional circular objects in the vicinity of the larger. (No details are available concerning corroborating reports.)

WHAT HAPPENED NOVEMBER 9th, 1957
- by Van S. Miller -

[EDITOR'S NOTE: Mr. Miller was, from 1957 to 1960, the editor of "Saucers", one of the pioneer UFO publications. He is also author of "Flying Saucers - Fact of Fiction", which was reviewed in the monthly 1957 issue of SAUCER NEWS. He was placed second prize in our Giant Literary Contest. The first prize article, by David Wightman, was published in our March 1961 issue.]

Most of us recall the tremendous quantity and quality of UFO sightings reports that followed the launching of Sputnik II on November 4th, 1957. While this "flap" was of brief duration, it was marked by numerous accounts of radio interference, mysterious globes that landed on highways and at the site of the first station location in New Mexico, and numerous reports of suddenly and unexplainably ceasing to function.

This activity was climaxed when a Pan American airliner bound for Honolulu mysteriously vanished during the early morning hours of November 9th. Coast Guard surface vessels, air carrier aircraft, Air Force aircraft, and the Navy aircraft carrier "Philippine Sea" immediately began one of the most intensely air-sea search operations ever initiated.

Some of the search aircraft reported sighting aerial flares at night, but these reports were eventually discounted as being unrelated to the missing airliner. Finally, on November 14th, the Navy's great search began - aircraft from the "Philippine Sea" discovered bodies and some wreckage 90 miles north of the intended flight path of Pan American Clipper 944.

From that time till now we have had no official comment regarding the fate of the airliner. In fact, the entire matter was "classified". (This security, however, is not particularly unusual. Almost all accident investigations are kept under wraps until the final report is completed.) The Civil Aeronautics Board, however, has just completed and released its lengthy and exhaustive report on the incident, revealing some interesting aspects of the "accident".

Clipper 944 departed from San Francisco at 7:51 GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), November 5th. In transit, 36 passengers including Captain Gordon H. Brown and First Officer William P. Bryant. Of more than casual interest to the UFO researcher is the name of the second officer - William H. Fontanberry.

It will be remembered that on the night of July 14th, 1952, Pan American First Officer William B. Nash and Second Officer William Fortenberry sighted a UFO formation while approaching Norfolk, Virginia. This was the first UFO sighting on record where the witnesses were above the phenomena. The Air Force has classified this report "Conclusion - Unknown", (Nash and Fortenberry recorded this experience in an article "Flying Above Flying Saucers", which appeared in the October 1959 issue of True Magazine.)

The flight path of the missing Clipper 944 specified a cruising altitude of 16,000 feet and a true airspeed of 225 knots, according to the CAB report. The gross weight was 117,000 pounds, and included fuel for about 15 hours.

All required position reports were made, and Flight 44-N was routed to Coca Station base. November 6th at 11:26, when a radio fix was taken in position 10 miles east of the vessel. Then at midnight...

Here is the OCR text from the document:

When report was at 1:04, but nothing unusual was reported. The next report, due at 1:04, was not received. The airliner was then designated "unreported".

As previously stated, some wreckers was discovered on November 14th, and a total of 19 bodies were recovered, 110 of them wearing life jackets, immediately, two CAB investigators, representatives of Pan American and the CAA (now FAA), and two pathologists of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (now CAA) were flown to the "Philippine Sea" for an on-the-spot investigation.

"External examination of the bodies was done, carefully noting all external injuries," the CAB report explained. "There was no evidence of foul play found on any of the recorded bodies." Evidence of fire was found only on wreckage floating above water, indicating that any fire must have occurred after the airliner had crashed. "No evidence of a left-light explosion in the fuselage was found," said the CAB.

Cargo manifests, however, indicated the presence of sodium sulfide, a volatile chemical, but this was packaged inconspicuously, and it is unlikely that the chemical had any connection with the crash.

A small amount of radioactive medicine was also on board the airliner.

One of the two independent approaches of the inquiry was the fact that Flight N-6034 was equipped with two high frequency radio transmitting and receiving systems. In addition, these systems were equipped with SELCAL, eliminating the need for continuous pilot monitoring of the radio equipment. SELCAL generates pre-set coded tones which are transmitted on a voice communication frequency. This device is on control pedestal between the pilots, readily usable by both.

But why wasn't at least one of the airliners transmitters - or SELCAL - used? What could possibly have happened to prevent the pilot, first officer, second officer or navigator from employing this life-saving device, for their position would be unknown to rescue parties without this information? (And remember, the airliner was 90 miles off course, for a reason yet to be ascertained.)

ARINC (Aeronautical Radio, Inc.) handles all surface-to-air communications for Pan American Purveying the possibility that an emergency message might have been sent through without having been detected, the CAB carefully examined the ARINC tape recordings for the frequency over which a message would have been sent.

"Initially nothing was apparent," the report stated. "However, repeated playbacks of the tapes of the period following the 1014 position report disclosed previously unknown transmissions which were extremely weak and subject to varied and conflicting interpretations."

More than three months, utilizing proven and experimental techniques and the finest available recording equipment, were devoted to resolving this salvage and recorded tape "Another attempt to understand the message was made by Pan American World Airways," the CAB report continued. "A number of supervisory personnel and communications personnel, including a navigator, having personal experience in previously talking with the crew members, were unable to gain any significant intelligible information from the playbacks of the recorded messages. Despite the comprehensive research, the Board could not definitely establish that any emergency transmissions came from Clipper 944."

A check with the offices of 14 other airline flights to Hawaii on November 5th-6th revealed that none had received any communication from the missing airliner.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Investigators have decided that the probable point of impact was 50 degrees 25 minutes north, 14 degrees 5 minutes west. This estimate would place the aircraft 105 miles east of the last recorded position and some 600 miles (70 miles) off course. In the final position, weather conditions were extremely favorable and devoid of turbulence, lightning, precipitation, icing, etc. The was was recorded to have been unusually calm, the temperature was about 40 degrees.

However, two pertinent conclusions regarding the final position of the flight are evident. The CAB report notes: "Consideration of the distance from the last known position to the impact point, and of the results of navigation, shows that the flight did not turn as required to traverse the course. Also, the distance from the planned route indicates that appreciable lateral distance, not on course and very from the ocean station, was traversed after the last position."

"It is difficult to understand why the captain would have placed the aircraft away from known route." In turn, the meteorological examination indicated that at least 10 or 15 persons aboard bodies had ice forming. Further, the lack of extensive navigation equipment, together with a strong condition of the bodies, suggested that the water impact, although severe, was not sufficiently great to cause complete disintegration of the aircraft.

Pathological data showed evidence of toxication from carbon monoxide. Several wrist watches recovered have established a probable time of impact at 11:27 local time.

A check of the records of the entire crew showed nothing unusual. All crew had had a good deal of previous experience with Boeing 377, and the crew members were all under current certification by the CAA. Line maintenance records indicated nothing out of the ordinary, although the CAA was not maintained with the thoroughness of some maintenance reports.

These are the findings reported by the Civil Aeronautics Board.

13. No evidence of foul play or sabotage was found.

14. Irregularities of maintenance practices and/or procedures disclosed during the investigation could not be linked to the accident.

The Board has insufficient tangible evidence at this time to determine the cause of the accident. Further research and investigation is in progress concerning the significance of evidence of carbon monoxide in body tissue of the aircraft occupants.

The CAB report analytically offers no explanation for the crash, and it offered only one possibility that could have accounted for the emergency: "A....probable source of CO (carbon monoxide)," the report stated, "would be an unusual occurrence in a power package which could have initiated a chain of events leading to the introduction of carbon monoxide in the fuselage. Such an unusual occurrence could be a failure which would release part of a propeller blade or its entire propeller, or a failed two-supercharger disk. It is likely that such an occurrence would be accompanied by serious flight control problems and possibly fire. If a propellor disk, such as a propeller, came through the fuselage, it could easily start a fire, knock out some radio equipment, take emergency smoke evacuation procedures inoperative, and destroy the crew's oxygen supply. Such an occurrence this known circumstance has been more likely than any other possibilities."

But the facts still remain, as Aviation Week Magazine recently headlined: "Panna Crash Remains Unknown."

Dear Captain Gregory:

Well over a month ago I wrote the Air Force Press Desk requesting certain confidential information on several UFO sightings. I have received no reply as of yet. I doubt if you will reply also, but you might at least send this letter to someone that will. It seems that Section M4 is the section, the most likely contact on the movement. Stamp to do anything, etc.

I request the following information: The official Air Force explanation in the case of the UFO seen by Mr. [redacted] in Cuyaga County, Ohio on November 5, 1957. The same for the object seen by Mrs. [redacted] on November 12, 1957 at Madison, Ohio. And the following - does the Air Force have any knowledge of a man who calls himself [redacted] in that it is supposed to have taken a number of photographs of the object seen by Mr. [redacted]. If he will drive - is not known.

Occasionally I do make a thorough investigation of what I consider an exceptionally good UFO sighting. If I thought that the Air Force was really sincere in their apparent attempt to get to the bottom of the UFO problem, I might send you the data I collect on sightings that you don't know about and can't report to you by other means.

Sincerely,

Major J. Friend
ATIC
Wright Patterson Field, Ohio

Dear Major Friend,

I received a very hastily written note from your friend Dan Habor in which he asked me to copy a bit of data regarding General MacArthur's statements to General Nantes, Italy. I believe he wants quotes from the recent Trevor James book which I have borrowed from him. Actually he wrote in such haste I am not sure if he meant just the quote in the book or if I should include the actual quotes from the report of this meeting in Oct. 1955.

Onpage 107 of this book by James "They Live In The Sky" the author has given as a possible reason why governments are loathe to reveal what has been deduced the theory that astral beings which could upset all scientific and religious theory may soon invade. ( My interpretation of this material ) I quote, ...

"However, I believe that there may be some highly placed man of signal spiritual quality who already know what faces humanity, and who might well be the agency through which this information will be passed on to the nations.

Supporting this viewpoint is the report that General Douglas MacArthur had made a remarkable statement to a group of Naples, Italy, during a visit to New York by the Italian dignitary. On October 8, 1955, he stated to the press: "The (MacArthur) believes that because of the development of science, all countries on earth will have to unite to survive, and to make a common front against attack by people from other planets" end quote.

As I recall he stated also future politics would be cosmic or between planets. He quoted the late Einstein who when asked what weapons would be used in a third world war as saying he did not know but was sure a fourth world war would be fought with sticks, clubs and stones.

I am in complete agreement. I certainly abhor the stories being told by the alleged contactees. I feel certain if anyone could contact space people I should and Lord knows I have tried. In 1957 when I started this area with his news he watched a UFO land I thought it was hilarious. I did not think it so funny four days later when one hovered in my own back yard. Because I sincerely thought these things existed in the minds of fiction writers and unreliable mental deficients when I saw this thing I was not one bit afraid for I was certain it had a logical explanation. I watched it close to thirty minutes before I convinced myself there was no logical explanation...for this object or the burns I received while I watched. Or the blood vessels that burst on my neck, legs etc. Or the strange alteration in body glands. I suppose it is mere coincidence I did not have one monthly period for the exact time no female dog in my kennel did not come in heat. I wonder about the dog...


- page 38 -

that had been so healthy when shown at dog shows...she died full of
cancer. On the bitch that whelped a litter of four -nonarthritis.
Thank God I was ignorant of UFO. Had I heard these fool contact tales
I might have gone closer. I saw enough then and on following nights to
know they (whoever they are) know every inch of this terrain. It was
widely circulated I was "emotional"...You bet. I liked to deal of fear
night after night knowingan unknown was here. I guess misery likes
company. I took great pleasure not only meeting these people but also
from a story straight from another man who had been burned by these
things there is no proof exists. He told of watching 2 Red lights that
worked all night too. People like us appreciate the

I admit I am surprised to have him asking me to send you data for I did
not know he was assiting your department. Of course I know him only
slightly for he has been irked with my refusal to use my story for
public release. I would feel like a testimonial for God only knows what,
and yet perhaps I am wrong for had I suspected I could actually be
harmed I surely would not have remained out to look.

Sincerely,

Science News Letter for October 26, 1957

Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

[Most of the first paragraph is illegible due to image quality]

not in Pegasus at all, but in the neighboring group of Andromeda. The constellation represents the Ethiopian princess who, according to mythology, was chained to a rock as a sacrifice to the sea monster.

Alongside Venus in the south, Fortunately, she was rescued by the hero, Perseus, who is seen in the north.

Orion Season's Finest
This is Orion, the warrior, easily recognized because of the three stars in a row that form his belt. To the left is Betelgeuse, on the right is Rigel, both of the most magnificent stars in the sky. Although they do not appear as bright as they will in the coming months, they are still brilliant.

Further east is Mars, rising almost in the head of the sun. Its brightness is about half that of Jupiter, and Saturn are both too near the sun to be easily visible.

Shower of "Stars" to Come
November is the month bringing one of the year's famous showers of meteors, or "shooting stars," which appear from about the 13th to the 16th.

These meteors are often seen in the morning because then we are on the forward side of the earth in its annual movement around the sun. Thus, we meet them head-on. This is different from the evening hours when we see the backward part, and see only those that catch up to us.

[The rest of the text describes star charts and constellations visible in the sky]
