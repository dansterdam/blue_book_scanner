The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text describing an observed UFO.

The text reads as follows:

ON THE OBJECT WITH THE OBJECT ROTATING IN A MANNER CAUSING THE RED AND GREEN LIGHT TO PASS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT ALONG THE EDGE OF A PLANE RUNNING ROUGHLY PARALLEL TO THE GROUND. LIGHTS COULD BE DESCRIBED AS REVOLVING ABOUT THE OUTSIDE OF THE OBJECT. THERE WERE TWENTY-FIVE REVOLUTIONS OF THE OBJECT PER MINUTE BASED ON AN ASSUMPTION BY THE OBSERVER THAT THERE WERE ONLY TWO LIGHTS SPACED APPROXIMATELY 90 DEGREES APART IN THE PLANE OF ROTATION. THE RED LIGHT PRECEDED THE GREEN LIGHT. BOTH LIGHTS WERE OBSCURED FROM SIGHT DURING A PORTION OF EACH ROTATION. (7) NO TAIL, NO TRAIL, NO EXHAUST FROM THE OBJECT. (8) NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE OBJECT. (9) NO OTHER PERTINENT FEATURE OBSERVED. 3. DESCRIPTION OF COURSE OF OBJECT: (1) OBJECT FIRST CALLED TO ATTENTION OF OBSERVER WHEN HE NOTICED AN AIRCRAFT ON AN APPARENT COLLISION COURSE WITH THE UFO. THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED ON ITS COURSE AND APPEARED TO PASS UNDER THE OBJECT. (2) OBJECT FIRST OBSERVED APPROXIMATELY 25 TO 30 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL. (3) ANGLE OF ELEVATION AT DISAPPEARANCE WAS THE SAME AS APPEARANCE. (4) THE OBJECT APPEARED TO REMAIN SUSPENDED IN SPACE. NO COURSE OR FLIGHT PATH WAS OBSERVED. (5)
