COMPARED TO A QUARTER HELD AT ABOUT ARMS LENGTH. (3) COLOR
BLUISH WHITE (4) ONE OBJECT (5) NO FORMATION (6) DISCERNIBLE

ON THE OBJECT WITH THE OBJECT ROTATING IN A MANNER CAUSING THE
RED AND GREEN LIGHT TO PASS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT ALONG THE EDGE
OF A PLANE RUNNING ROUGHLY PARALLEL TO THE GROUND. LIGHTS COULD
BE DESCRIBED AS REVOLVING ABOUT THE OUTSIDE OF THE OBJECT.

THERE WERE TWENTY TO TWENTY-FIVE REVOLUTIONS OF THE OBJECT PER
MINUTE BASED ON AN ASSUMPTION BY THE OBSERVER THAT THERE WERE
ONLY TWO LIGHTS SPACED APPROXIMATELY 90 DEGREES APART IN THE
PLANE OF ROTATION. THE RED LIGHT PRECEDED THE GREEN LIGHT.
BOTH LIGHTS WERE OBSCURRED FROM SIGHT DURING A PORTION OF EACH
ROTATION. (7) NO TAIL, NO TRAIL, NO EXHAUST FROM THE OBJECT.
(8) NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE OBJECT. (9) NO OTHER PERTINENT
FEATURE OBSERVED.

8. DESCRIPTION OF COURSE OF OBJECT:
(1) OBJECT FIRST CALLED TO ATTENTION OF OBSERVER WHEN HE NOTICED
AN AIRCRAFT ON AN APPARENT COLLISION COURSE WITH THE UFO. THE
AIRCRAFT CONTINUED ON ITS COURSE AND APPEARED TO PASS UNDER THE
OBJECT (2) OBJECT FIRST OBSERVED APPROXIMATELY 25 TO 30 DEGREES
ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL. (3) ANGLE OF ELEVATION AT DISAPPEARANCE
WAS THE SAME AS APPEARANCE. (4) THE OBJECT APPEARED TO REMAIN
SUSPENDED IN SPACE. NO COURSE OR FLIGHT PATH WAS OBSERVED. (5)

OBJECT DISAPPEARED WHEN A LIGHT CLOUD BANK MOVED IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST OBSCURING THE OBJECT (S) OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT FOR TWO HOURS FIFTEEN MINUTES.

C. MANNER OF OBSERVATION:
(1) OBSERVATION WAS GROUND VISUAL. OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO IDAHO CONTROL, GROUND RADAR. NO RADAR CONTACT WAS ESTABLISHED. (2) A PAIR OF LOW POWER FIELD GLASSES WERE USED TO VIEW THE OBJECT. GLASSES APPARENTLY NO MORE THAN TWO OR THREE POWER. (3) NO AIRBORNE SIGHTING WAS REPORTED.

D. TIME AND DATE OF SIGHTING: 10/0115 ZULU. (2) LIGHT CONDITIONS WERE NIGHT.

E. LOCATION OF OBSERVER WAS OMAHA, NEBRASKA. OBJECT WAS VIEWED AT APPROXIMATELY 120 TO 110 DEGREES FROM THIS LOCATION.

F. IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF ALL OBSERVERS:
(1) TWO CIVILIAN OBSERVERS WERE MRS. [REDACTED], AGE 38, HOUSEWIFE AND MISS [REDACTED], AGE 17, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT BOTH OF [REDACTED], OMAHA, NEBRASKA.

SERGEANT DICK J. BURKARD, 789TH ACWRON, DIRECTION CENTER CREW CHIEF. HIS RELIABILITY HAS NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED.

G. WEATHER AND WINDS ALOFT AT TIME OF OBSERVATION:
(1) OBSERVER DESCRIBED WEATHER AS CLEAR WITH MEDIUM HEIGHT CLOUDS MOVING FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST AT APPROXIMATELY 10/0339Z.

(2) 20TH ADIV WEATHER SERVICE REPORTED WINDS ALOFT FOR IDAHO CONTROL AT 10/0001Z AS, 6000 31@/15, 10,000 280/30, 16000 290@

(3) CEILING-CLEAR UNLIMITED (4) VISIBILITY - 15 (5) NO CLOUD COVER (6) NO THUNDER STORMS

H. 20TH ADIV WEATHER REPORTED THREE SLIGHT TEMPERATURE INVERSIONS EXISTED AT SURFACE LEVEL, 220@ FEET AND 13000 FEET.

I. NO INTERCEPT ACTION WAS TAKEN AS NO CONTACT WITH OBJECT COULD BE ESTABLISHED.

J. NO CORRELATION OF AIR TRAFFIC WAS POSSIBLE AS DISTANCE OF OBJECT FROM OBSERVER WAS NOT DETERMINED.

K. PREPARING OFFICER, CAPTAIN HOWARD T. MOODY, UNIT INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. CAREFUL INTERROGATION OF THE OBSERVER HAS NOT PRODUCED CHANGES IN FACT AS INITIALLY REPORTED. OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BOTH FROM A MOVING VEHICLE AND A FIXED POSITION. NO APPARENT MOVEMENT

OTHER THAN ROTATION WAS REPORTED. COMPARISON TO A PASSING AIRCRAFT
WAS MADE. CONFERENCE WITH 20TH ADW WEATHER SERVICE TENDS TO
DISCOUNT ANY MIRAGE DUE TO TEMPERATURE INVERSION. PRELIMINARY
ANALYSIS DOES NOT SUPPORT NOR DENY THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOME
OBJECT WAS SEEN. THIS OBSERVER REPORTS HE HAS SEEN A SIMILAR
OBJECT ON ONE PREVIOUS OCCASION. THE OBSERVER IS A QUALIFIED
RADAR OPERATOR AND IS FIRMLY CONVINCED AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF
SOME OBJECT DURING THE PERIOD OF OBSERVATION.
L. NO PHOTOGRAPHS OR OTHER PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WERE OBTAINED.
