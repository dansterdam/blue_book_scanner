SUMMARY OF INFORMATION
CIG FIELD AREA OFFICE #2, Nashville, Tennessee

Subject: Observation of Unidentified Objects in Sky, Vicinity of Nashville, Tenn.

Date: 30 March 1950

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

Unidentified objects were reported to have been observed in the sky at Marrowbone Lake at approximately 0700 hrs, 29 Mar 1950. Observers, Mr. and Mr. "J" Nashville Real Estate Salesmen, were fishing on the lake (located approximately 16 miles from Nashville on highway 41-A, in the direction of Clarksville, Tenn.) when the following incident occurred: Between six and twelve dark objects, at an altitude of 200 to 300 ft, flew into the opening above the lake through a break in the hills at the southeast and circled behind the hills on the west side, at the while losing altitude steadily. The objects were black, round, heavy in appearance, about five feet long, looked like a 300 lb bomb, and made a noise like wind blowing through the trees. No motors were visible. They were fairly close together and turned together, traveling at least 500 miles per hr. The newspaper (attached clipping), relates that a spokesman at Stewart AFB, Smyrna, Tenn., said that the objects could not have been jet propelled planes because of the description of the objects and weather conditions at that time. The OSI, Stewart AFB, was contacted at 1200 hrs, 30 Mar 1950 and they had accomplished nothing regarding investigation of the incident. (F-6)
