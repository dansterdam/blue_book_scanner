SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part II)

1. Source, an instrument instructor pilot, Flight "D", 6th Air Rescue Squadron, MATS, Goose Bay Airport, Labrador, reports that at 1544, 1 March 1952, while flying NEAC C-47 7184 at 6,000 feet over Goose Air Base, he observed vapor trails overhead, according to the source, the trails were caused by a fast moving aircraft, probably jet, which was flying at a very high altitude and in a north-easterly direction over Goose Air Base.

2. Captain Matthews immediately reported the incident to Goose Air Base tower operator who stated that he had no knowledge of any aircraft in the area other than the local aircraft he was working at the time.

3. Source added that there was no doubt in his mind that the vapor trails were real, as he had seen them often while flying in Europe during World War II.

4. The sighting of the vapor trails was confirmed by Major R. Hange, pilot of the aircraft.
