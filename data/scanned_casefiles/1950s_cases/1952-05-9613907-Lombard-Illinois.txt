1. Reference is made to your Report 1706DN-252 dated 29 May 52 and basic letter, Intell 000.9 dated 31 May 1952. Analysis of the object shows it to be a large Class narcotic covered with a tar-like substance. It is impossible to determine its origin, although it is probably near-made. About the only conclusions which can be made are that the object had not traveled at any great speed for any distance (which would have melted any nearby coating) and that a high velocity or impact would either have shattered the glass or driven it through the mail box rather than merely denting it. It is deemed quite probably that the marble has thrown or slung. Because of the foregoing, no further investigation of this matter is believed necessary.

2. Your cooperation is appreciated.

2. An analysis of the object shows that the object is a large glass marble covered with an unknown substance. The origin of the object or the coating is unknown.

3. It would be possible to determine the energy necessary to dent the mailbox, as mentioned in the original report, therefore, obtaining an estimate of how the marble fell or if it were shot from a "slingshot", etc. However, it is not deemed advisable to do this due to time and financial factors.

4. Your cooperation in forwarding this object is appreciated.

PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

The following report is submitted in compliance with AICL 200-1, dtd 11 Apr 51, as amended by AIC 1580N INTELLIGENCE, Issue No. 3, dtd 16 Apr 52.

1. One (1) spherical, transparent, glass-like object, measuring approximately one inch in diameter, covered with a thin layer of tar- or magnesium-like substance, was recovered.

2. Object struck steel mailbox at residence of Mr. [REDACTED], LOMBARD, ILLINOIS, at approximately 0330 hours CST 21 May 1952. Bounded corner of steel mailbox was dented approximately three-sixteenths (3/16) of an inch by the impact, where a minute amount of object's outer covering was deposited before object ricocheted to porch, leaving a black mark in the last two and one-half (2-1/2) feet of its roll.

3. Four minutes after the noisy impact, Mr. [REDACTED] located the object, and picked it up, but dropped it as it was too hot to hold. It did not burn his hand. Upon cooling of the tar-like covering, attack to his fingers. The object dropped on the wet lawn, where it steamed. Forming a small steam-like cloud in the still air until the object cooled. Twenty minutes later Mr. [REDACTED] took it to the Lombard Police Station.

4. Partially closed porch and roof overhang indicates object came from southeast (SSE) at approximately a forty-five (45) degree angle.

5. Object has not been analyzed nor tested for radio activity.

6. Nearest factory is an electromotive plant approximately twelve (12) miles southeast of LOMBARD.

7. Six F-86 type aircraft were airborne from O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, ten (10) miles northeast of LOMBARD, at the time of the incident. Of those six, two were on their first flight since their display to the public on Armed Forces Day. However, a check of these two aircraft reveals no traces of tar in the aft section. Aircraft were examined to determine the possibility of object having been deposited in aft section. There was negative evidence to indicate object had ever been so contained.

8. Weather: 12,000 broken, 25,000 broken, 2-1/2 miles visibility in smoke; temperature, 50°; dew point, 45; wind, calm; altimeter setting, 29.97.
