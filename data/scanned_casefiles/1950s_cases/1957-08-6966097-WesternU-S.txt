CND METEOR
SAN FRANCISCO ---- THIS >-A BRILLIANT GREEN METEOR FLASHED THROUGH WESTERN SKIES AT ABOUT 9:30 O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT, BRINGING SCORES OF CALLS TO POLICE AND NEWS MEDIA SWITCHBOARDS. MANY OBSERVERS THOUGHT IT WAS A CRASHING PLANE.

THE PHENOMENON, MOVING IN A GENERALLY EAST TO WEST DIRECTION, WAS REPORTED SEEN FROM SUCH DISTANT POINTS AS LOS ANGELES, PORTLAND, SALT LAKE CITY.

THE CAA SAID THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY AIRLINE PILOTS THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. ONE COAST GUARD PILOT REPORTED SEEING IT LOW ON THE HORIZON FROM 100 MILES OFF THE SEA.

IT WAS BELIEVED THE METEOR, DESCRIBED VARIOUSLY AS GREEN, BLUE, PHOSPHORESCENT AND YELLOW -- THE PREDOMINANT COLOR -- DISINTEGRATED IN AN EXPLOSION SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY OF YREKA AND MONTAGUE IN FAR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

RESIDENTS IN BOTH TOWNS REPORTED EXPLOSION-LIKE SOUNDS AFTER THE OBJECT STAKED OVERHEAD.

IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, THE COAST GUARD DISPATCHED A HELICOPTER TO SEARCH THE BAY NEAR THE SAN MATEO BRIDGE FOLLOWING REPORTS A PLANE HAD CRASHED INTO THE WATER. NO WRECKAGE WAS FOUND.

ONE WITNESS SAID THE METEOR APPEARED TO BE SHOWERING YELLOW PARTICLES INTO THE SKY AS IT PASSED OVER. A LOCAL RESIDENT SAID IT WAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE AND BRILLIANT DISPLAY.

SCIENTIFIC SOURCES SAID EARLY METEOR SHOWERS MAY BE EXPECTED IN EARLY AUGUST IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ANNUAL PERSEID PHENOMENA THAT PEAKS AUGUST 12.

[Additional paragraph about a coincidental fireball and UFO investigation]

[Newspaper clipping section with headline: "Bluish-Green Object Explodes in Sky"]

The newspaper clipping text is partially cut off, but begins with "SAN FRANCISCO -" and mentions details about the meteor sighting from various locations.

The document is marked "OFFICIAL" in the top right corner and appears to be from August 1957.
