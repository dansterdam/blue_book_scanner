ENS [REDACTED] REITERATES PREVIOUS DATA
SUBMITTED EXCEPT ESTIMATE OF DURATION OF
OBSERVATION WHICH HE NOW BELIEVES TO BE
ABOUT 10 SECONDS INSTEAD OF 15 OBSERVED
THROUGH ARC OF 60 TO 70 DEGREES. COULD NOT
ESTIMATE SIZE ACCURATELY. SAUCER IMPRESSION
BASED ON OVAL RATHER THAN CIRCULAR APPEARANCE
AS THOUGH DISC SEEN TILTED. ADDITIONAL IM-
PRESSION OF SPINNING MOTION. DESCRIBED AS
SOFT GLOW OF GOLDISH-ORANGE COLOR BUT
DEFINITELY NOT METEOR, A/C LANDING LIGHT,
