Location: New York, New York
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
DESCRIPTION: The observer, who was a pilot, reported seeing a white object in the sky move at a high rate of speed for several seconds and then disappear. The object was observed for about 15 seconds. The pilot stated that the object was not an aircraft, nor did it have the characteristics of a meteor or any other known object. The object was described as being approximately 30 feet in diameter and emitting a white glow.

CONCLUSION: The unidentified flying object observed in this case could not be explained or identified. The case remains unresolved.

OBSERVATIONS OF UNISTiENTIFILD FLYING OBJECTS

On 7 July 1952. at approximately 23:00 hours, the witness, a Mr. X (name withheld), observed three bright, circular objects maneuvering in the sky over New York City. The objects were moving at a high rate of speed and changing direction abruptly. The witness was able to take several photographs of the objects before they disappeared from view.

The photographs were forwarded to Project Blue Book for analysis. Though the objects could not be conclusively identified, the report indicates they demonstrated characteristics consistent with unidentified flying objects. No further information or analysis is provided in the document.

- page 23 -

The image appears to be a black-and-white photograph of a night sky or landscape. The image is blurred and hazy, with a dark, cloudy area on the left side and a lighter, more diffuse area on the right. There is a small, faint light source visible in the center of the frame.

Text output from OCR:

Mr. Porter:

The original report with the data and the
attached list is forwarded herewith.

The sighting was reported by two observers--one
a cook and the other a bar tender. According to
their story, they were both outside their place of
business at about 9:20 PM on 7 July 1952, when
they noticed an object in the sky moving in an
easterly direction. They described the object as
being round, silvery in color, and giving off a
bright light. It appeared to be about 2 or 3 times
the size of a star and seemed to be at an altitude
of approximately 1,500 feet. The object moved
across the sky at a rapid rate of speed and then
suddenly disappeared. The observers stated that
they had observed a similar object about 2 weeks
prior to this sighting.

I am forwarding this report for your information
and appropriate action.
