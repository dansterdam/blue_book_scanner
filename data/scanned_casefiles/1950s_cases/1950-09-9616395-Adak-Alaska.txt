10. CONCLUSION
    Other (LENS FLARE)
    A pronounced flare spot, in addition to the main image, was noted wth the lens wide. Any camera movement caused the flare spot to move, as well as the main image. Flare images are always encountered in photography when an unusually bright object is included in the field of view, and when the exposure is not portionally reduced.

1. The attached photographs have been examined and the probable explanation has been determined. A 4” x 5” Speed Graphic camera with coated lens was pointed toward the sun, and the image was examined on the ground glass. A pronounced flare spot, in addition to the main image, was noted with the lens wide open, f/4.7. Any camera movement caused the flare spot to move, as well as the main image. Inserting a flat glass filter before the lens in the conventional position produced additional flare spots, which moved about with slight variations in filter orientation.

2. Flare images are always encountered in photography when an unusually bright object is included in the field of view, and when the exposure is not proportionally reduced. The stated exposure is considerably in excess of normal for an object as bright as the sun, as shown also by considerable halation of the negatives about the sun images.

3. It is probable that the spots in question are nothing more than flare spots due to overexposure for sun brightness.

ADA)(, ALASKA
11 September 1950

On 11 September 1950 at 4:45 pm, a Coast Guard photographer
took four photographs of the total eclipse of the Sun, whose path
of totality crossed the Aleutian Islands near Adak, Alaska. The
photographer noticed nothing at the time when he took the pictures.
It was two years after the photographs had been taken that the
observer noticed the images on the film.
The photographs were examined and the probable cause determined.
A 4” x 5” Speed Graphic Camera with coated lens was pointed toward
the sun, and the image was examined on the ground glass. A pro-
nounced flare spot, in addition to the main image, was noted with the
lens wide open, f/4.7. Any camera movement caused the flare spot to
move, as well as the main image. Inserting a flat glass filter before
the lens in the conventional position produced additional flare spots,
which moved about with slight variations in filter orientation.
Flare images are always encountered in photography when an
unusually bright object is included in the field of view, and when the
exposure is not proportionally reduced. The stated exposure is con-
siderably in excess of normal for an object as bright as the sun, as
shown also by considerable halation of the negatives about the sun
images.
It is probable that the spots in question are nothing more than
flare spots due to overexposure for sun brightness.

Washington, D.C.

Subject: Four Photographic Negatives, showing images of the Sun in partial eclipse and in addition, unidentified images.

1. The enclosed subject negatives were exposed under the following conditions:
    a) Camera; 4 x 5 Speed Graphic
    b) Lens: Kodak Ektar, COATED, f. 4.7 127mm
    c) Film: Kodak Super-XX, film pack
    d) Filter: Wratten “A”
    e) Exposure; 1/100 sec. at f. 22
    f) Place; from the weather deck of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter NORTHWIND in the Bering Sea about 40 miles north of Adak in the Aleutian Islands
    g) Time: About 1600 hours in zone "plus eleven"
    h) Date: Total Eclipse of the Sun in the summer of 1950, whose path of totality crossed the Aleutian Islands near Adak Alaska
    i) Developed: 6 July, 1952 in Kodak Microdol, 15 mins at 76°

2. These negatives bear the pack sequence numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 and when viewed with the clipped corner held to the lower left, the eclipse images were exposed from left to right and from top to bottom, at fairly uniform intervals of approximately 50 seconds each.

3. It is apparent that the unidentified images to the right of the eclipse images are all of the same object, but vary in size, shape, attitude, altitude and distance from the eclipse image in each case. The possibility that they have some simple explanation in optics or meteorology has been considered carefully and in view of the inconsistencies mentioned were deemed worthy of being forwarded for expert scrutiny.
