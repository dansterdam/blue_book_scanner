30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

I can't think of anything pertinent.

In my original letter accompanying the negatives
I gave the conditions under which they were made,
and with that information and the negatives I'm sure
you have on your staff some one who can
Scrutinize them and come up with positive answers.

In paragraph 1(g) of my letter of 7 July 1952 I estimated
the time as 1600 hours and in 1(h) the date was not stated
but the almanac for 1950 shows that it was 1645 hours
on 11 Sept 1950 (Bering Sea Time) or 0345 hours

If I can be of any further assistance, you have my address.

1. The attached photographs have been examined and the probable explanation has been determined. A 4" x 5" Speed Graphic camera with coated lens was pointed toward the sun, and the image was examined on the ground glass. A pronounced flare spot, in addition to the main image, was noted with the lens wide open, f/4.7. Any camera movement caused the flare spot to move, as well as the main image. Inserting a flat glass filter before the lens in the conventional position produced additional flare spots, which moved about with slight variations in filter orientation.

2. Flare images are always encountered in photography when an unusually bright object is included in the field of view, and when the exposure is not proportionally reduced. The stated exposure is considerably in excess of normal for an object as bright as the sun, as shown also by considerable halation of the negatives above the sun images.

3. It is probable that the spots in question are nothing more than flare spots due to overexposure for sun brightness.

ADAK, ALASKA
11 September 1950

On 11 September 1950 at 4:45 pm, a Coast Guard photographer took four photographs of the total eclipse of the Sun, whose path of totality crossed the Aleutian Islands near Adak, Alaska. The photographer noticed nothing at the time when he took the pictures.

It was two years after the photographs had been taken that the observer noticed the images on the film.

The photographs were examined and the probable cause determined.

A 4" x 5" Speed Graphic Camera with coated lens was pointed toward the sun, and the image was examined on the ground glass. A pronounced flare spot, in addition to the main image, was noted with the lens wide open, f/4.7. Any camera movement caused the flare spot to move, as well as the main image. Inserting a flat glass filter before the lens in the conventional position produced additional flare spots, which moved about with slight variations in filter orientation.

Flare images are always encountered in photography when an unusually bright object is included in the field of view, and when the exposure is not proportionally reduced. The stated exposure is considerably in excess of normal for an object as bright as the sun, as shown also by considerable halation of the negatives about the sun images.

It is probable that the spots in question are nothing more than flare spots due to overexposure for sun brightness.

   g) Time: About 1600 hours in some "plus eleven"
   h) Date: Total Eclipse of the Sun in the summer of 1950, whose path of
      totality crossed the Aleutian Islands near Adak, Alaska
   i) Developed: 6 July 1958 in Kodak Microdol, 15 mins at 70°

2. These negatives bear the pack sequence numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 and when viewed with the clipped corner held to the lower left, the eclipse images were exposed from left to right and from top to bottom, at fairly uniform intervals of approximately 30 seconds each.

3. It is apparent that the unidentified images to the right of the eclipse images are all of the same object, but vary in size, shape, attitude, altitude and distance from the eclipse image. The possibility that they have some simple explanation in optics or meteorology has been considered carefully and in view of the inconsistencies mentioned were deemed worthy of being forwarded for expert scrutiny.
