reflected, appeared Moon size and circular, or global.

The section in the middle of the ship which reflected the white flash of light, must have been/door, or whatever they use for ingress and egress.

Another noticeable thing worthy of mention was the easy and immediate acceleration after the turn around was executed and the terrific velocity with which they zoomed up, westward and still going off and up:- up:- gradually diminishing in size until they were two dots, one following the other, and then they were mere pinpoints; then first one and instantly the other became invisible-- swallowed up by the immensity of "space".

Rockets? I would never believe that. A principle far, far beyond the comparative obsolescence of rockets. They(rockets) would certainly be impractical for interplanetary travel and that should go without having to argue the point. Also, could a rocket ship, such as we now have, remain perfectly still, immobile in the air, resisting gravitation? These ships certainly had gravitational control. I know because I saw a ship of the same kind once before, although not under such perfect conditions as the last time.

It was during the Fall of 1948, either in September, or October. I was standing on the terrace in front of a hillside apartment I then occupied. It was early evening and had just become dark. All Hollywood was smothering under a blanket of hazy, misty smog. Spotlights were streaking back and forth across the sky. It was so cloudy I don't think I saw a single star. Suddenly, I found my eyes resting on a

great, red, glowing blur. It was immense and shapeless in
the fuzzy, hazy smog. It was resting in the sky, perfectly
still, immobile. For a time I wondered if it could be a red
spotlight. But then, no spotlight could be that large. It
did not move and there was no red stem of light leading up
to the glowing blur. It just stood there, like something
awful and sinister, watching and studying us silently and
furtively. It was not making a sound. When suddenly it
moved itself and flashed off in a red streak, it made no
sound at all. This one was not outside of our atmosphere
and that is for sure. It was hanging in the air over
Hollywood, high enough to be catching and reflecting the
light of the sun, which was already far below the western
horizon.

Strangely enough, the ones I saw in September 1951 did
not make me shudder with an eerie dread as did the one in
1942. Perhaps it seemed so sinister because it was so silent,
still, sneaky looking being shrouded in the mist.

I am attaching herewith an exact map of the heavens for
the day, date, hour and place when I saw those strange space
ships in 1951. Your guess is as good as mine from whence they
came, but there is a logical conclusion to be drawn from the
positions of the planets of our system as shown in the chart
herewith.

They appeared from away up in the sky, far to the west, so,
it is obvious they did not come from Jupiter. As you may see
on the chart Jupiter was conjuncting the Eastern Horizon.

They could not have come from Uranus, for Uranus was at the


- page 3 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Nadir-- away down under. They did not come from the direction
of either Mars, or Pluto for both were posited in the Sign
of Leo, in the fifth division of the chart, about halfway
between the nadir and the western horizon.

For obvious reasons they did not come from either Mercury
or Venus, because those two have orbits within the orbit of
the Earth, while the ships in question came from far beyond
the Earth's orbit, or, I should say, outside of the Earth's
orbit. Besides, Venus and Mercury were posited in Virgo,
and so was the Sun and they were in the sixth division,
intercepted and below the horizon (western).

That leaves us with three remaining possibilities, as
follows:

(a) S A T U R N -- in Libra 2.40'; only 5.53 below
the western horizon.

(b) N E P T U N E -- in Libra 17.53', setting. A
surer possibility than Saturn for the nomination.

(c) T A S U-- in Libra about 16 degrees, setting.

Of course, only those of you who have read my book [REDACTED] will recognise the name of this planet,
not yet known to our mighty astronomers. The first edition
of the book was published in 1919; another in 1921 and
another edition in 1922. The New York Public Library may
still have some copies. I then mentioned that there were
t w o other planets to our Solar system and named the one
beyond Neptune "ESLAR". They located that one in 1930 and
named it "PLUTO" a most unsuitable name. The one beyond
Pluto, which they have not yet claimed to have discovered,
is TASMU; also a very likely possibility.

The Moon, in Scorpio 23°.10, was the only planet elevated above the horizon and visible. It was posited in the sixth division, about halfway between the Seventh angle (western horizon) and the Meridian (Tenth angle). If the space voyagers were observing this planet we live on, they were certainly afforded a perfect view. If they launched smaller crafts, since they were too enormous to land on the Moon, at such a distance I would not be able to/anything as small as one of our aeroplanes, for example. It is a rational supposition that those were two mother-ships, loaded with smaller landing crafts. Why should they not explore the Earth satellite? Surely, the Earthians are doing nothing about the Moon. Here we have been dragging our satellite around day in and day out, year in and year out, for ages, and we have not even taken the trouble to find out what we have been dragging around.

It is my theory that the farther away the planet is from the Sun, the greater is the burden of necessity under which the inhabitants exist-- no prolific vegetation-- no warmth from the Sun and but little light; enough necessity to make them very skillful, deliberate, inventive and very much on the ball all the time to continue to exist.

One thing is certain; there are those on either Saturn, Neptune, or Uranus who are very curious about us and our little Moon. In closing may I say, I hope and pray, we will not some day, awake to find our Moon taken away, it could be done, you know. Moons are valuable reflectors of light to planets far from the Sun.

WHO ELSE SAW THIS?

With my two eyes wide open, in full possession of my senses and as sober as any self-respecting judge should be, I saw what, to the best of my knowledge and belief, no one else has ever seen outside of the pages of a science-fiction magazine!

I will say this much, from where I witnessed the astounding phenomena, I looked around to see if there were others looking skyward-- not a single soul! I was standing on the sidewalk alongside the parking-lot on Wilcox Avenue. On Hollywood Boulevard, a quarter of a block away, looking South, I could see people walking East and West. They walked fast. They walked slowly. They looked at each other. They looked down; around; in the shop windows; but, no one looked up! No one looked any higher than to another pair of eyes! A couple passed me, going in the opposite direction on Wilcox. They were looking at each other. Directly across the street a lone man stood before the show-window of a bookstore (since removed). His eyes were glued to the gaudy book-jackets on display. And throughout all this human indifference to anything outside of their circumscribed ambience, the most sensational actual event in all history could have been witnessed by lifting their eyes to Earth's constant companion and fellow-traveler-- the MOON.

I stood there looking skyward, speechless! Struck mute.

by the sudden, unbelievable spectacle.

It occurred as follows:
Date:   September 6th, 1951
Hour:   About 7:20 p.m.
         (true local time)
Place:  Hollywood 28, California
Day:    Thursday

THE OCCURRENCE:

The whole thing happened so fast and was so breath-taking that it is difficult to remember exactly, to the second, the amount of time involved. I doubt if the whole thing lasted over five minutes and definitely not as long as ten minutes.

It was the fifth day of the moon, when somewhat less than half of the orb is visible. The sun was already below the horizon and the moon had just begun to reflect the solar radiance. I was walking south on Wilcox avenue, between Yucca Street and Hollywood Boulevard. The moon was in south declination and hanging lowish in the southwestern sky. It was alone in all its glory for there was nothing else in sight in the heavens-- no stars-- no planets-- nothing but the moon, as far as visibility would permit, all alone in the cloudless, pure cerulean.

I wondered idly when the first star would begin to twinkle and would I be able to guess which one it was. I paused for a moment in front of the parking place and gas station to scan the hyaline empyrean for a glimpse of a star. Then it happened: No better time could have been chosen, no better setting selected for what was immediately to transpire.

From the furthest I could see in the south-western

dome, more west than south, there appeared a pinpoint of
glowing, deep red. I thought: 'there is no such star!'--
and kept my eyes glued on it. To my utter amazement it was
increasing in size, until it became as large as a regular
star. And, just about then, another of the same appeared,
following in the same route behind the first. They kept
at the same distance apart, at the same speed, along the
same route, with precision plus. From the moment they
first appeared out of immeasurable space, until they
reached the Moon, did not take over three or four seconds.
At a point far west they curved to the right in their
course and headed in the direction of the Moon. It would
appear the whole thing was well planned and executed with
precision. By the time they had taken their stations on
either side of the Moon, but above it, they appeared to
be, from where I stood, to be about the size of the Moon
when in far north declination and full. As everyone knows,
the Moon appears largest when furthest south, and vice-
versa.

The two glowing red objects remained poised, perfectly
still, one on the side facing the Earth and the other on
the side away from the earth-- the side of the Moon we
never see. I noticed that they were careful to keep out
of a certain radius from it, for they were just beyond
about the outer edges of the circle we see around the Moon
on a misty night, when the orb is full.

The objects appeared glowing red and round, like two
saucers, but they were not "saucers" by any means, as I

shall soon prove, according to what I actually saw.
At this point, let us consider facts and straight logic.
We are given to understand, by the astronomers, that the
mean distance of the Moon, from the Earth, is two hundred
and forty thousand miles. We are also given to understand
that the Moon is one-sixth the size of the Earth. Therefore,
if an object other than the Moon, seen at the same distance
from the Earth as the Moon, appears almost as large as the
Moon itself, are we to conclude that such an object must
then be approximately one-sixth the size of the Earth in
size?

Perhaps, it should be taken into consideration that what
appeared to be a shield of red metal, or some other red
material was used to reflect the Sun's light and heat. Of
course, unlike the Earth, a space ship would not have all
the protective layers of atmosphere, consisting of troposphere, stratosphere, aurora, and heavyside layers around
it and it is reasonable to assume that, without a powerful
reflector, it would burst into flame and rendered to ashes
in space. This reflector, however, could very well cause
the object it protects to appear larger than it actually
is and could also make it, at such a great distance away,
seem round like a saucer. As I shall explain later, these
objects under discussion were not round, but long. A careful study of our Moon seemed to have been the object of the
visit. With the kind of knowledge and skill the travelers
in those ships must have, judging by the smoothness of the
whole operation, the unbelievable speed, the great size of

their crafts, it would be fairly safe to imagine the
great superiority of all their equipment over anything we
have yet produced on this planet. For example, what
would I not give to take a look at some of those pictures
they took of the other side of the Moon. What marvelous
cameras they must have; what sound recorders! What
telescopes! I wouldn't be surprised if they could have
seen me close-up, as I stood there looking at them, trans-
fixed, with my mouth-- closed.

Whatever they were doing, they worked fast, for in a
few minutes they began to move again. They were turning
around; first the leader and like its shadow, the second
ship was making a turn. The size of the ships must have
been certainly enormous, for the turning around was
obviously laborious. They swung down toward the Moon as
they manipulated the turn in a wide arc. It was then I
became certain that they were not round orbs, but were
very long and comparatively narrow, with respect to their
length. I also saw that they were not entirely enclosed
in the red shield, because, as the foremost one half made
the turn about, I observed not only its length, but also
a strip-- a flash-- of brilliant white light from top to
bottom in the middle of the ship. It is safe to guess that
each one of those ships could easily carry two million
persons. The one which led coming in, led going back. The
route and the precision manner of traveling were the same
coming and going.

If they made any sound it probably could not be heard

from such a distance. We can see, especially through
hyaline space, at greater distance than we can hear, for
the obvious reason that while electrons (light) travel at
about 186,200 miles per second, while sound, in warm summer
air, can barely do about 1,266 feet per second and in zero
cold weather from 1,068 to 1,150 feet per second. Besides,
even if the sound was loud enough to be heard from such a
distance, it would describe such a wide arc that all
places, excepting where it bends within hearing range, would
be "zones of silence".

Sound has many mediums and the rate of speed per feet
per second depends upon the medium, iron and steel being the
greatest, rating from 15,480 to 17,390 for hot iron and
16,360 for cast steel. But, what kind of medium would
"space" be? And why should the field of solar flux through which
the light we see traveling be called "space"? Space is merely the interval between objects, but to most persons it
implies emptiness. Even though they cannot be seen with
human eyes, are not electrons objects too? Sound would
probably be supersonic traveling through space (so-called).

If the ships in question had wings, I saw none. I doubt
if they had any. Again comes up the question of distance
relative to detail. Yet, as the near ship turned, if it had
wings I would have detected any such indication; that is,
if wings have to be in proportion to the length of the
craft, because, even considering the distance, the ship was
longer than the diameter of the moon, at least, thrice as
long. It was the front view which, with the sunlight it
