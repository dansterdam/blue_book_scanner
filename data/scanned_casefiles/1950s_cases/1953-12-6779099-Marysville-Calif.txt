10. CONCLUSION
UNIDENTIFIED
Jet with afterburner ruled out since observer too close to obj not to hear sound and have illusion of hovering.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Saucer shape, size of baseball, brilliant bluish light which did not radiate, observer saw reflection of light from obj on nearby filling station bldg. East speed 140-190 mph, hovered momentarily, moved north and faded into night. Obj was 300 ft alt before drop to 100-150 ft alt, hovered over airport.

The image shows a detailed adiabatic chart with multiple grid lines, temperature scales, and a complex line graph traversing the chart. The chart appears to be a meteorological tool for analyzing atmospheric conditions. The header indicates it is from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Weather Bureau, and is specifically labeled as WBAN-318.

The chart includes:
- Horizontal axis showing longitude from -90° to -40°
- Vertical axis showing altitude or pressure levels
- Numerous grid lines and numerical markings
- A dark line tracing a path across the chart, likely representing some meteorological data or calculation

The document appears to be a black and white scanned image with some slight degradation typical of older document scanning.

it occurred at a small airport and the duration was one and one-half minutes. Followup should have been made to determine whether there were other potential witnesses. Since it occurred at mid-night on December 28, it is possible that there were no other witnesses available. Must be carried as unidentified, single witness.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.

One witness, duration of sighting only 15 seconds. Witness was a 67 year old lady. Sighting occurred at 9 p.m. daylight saving time in the middle of August, and thus the sky should still have been reasonably bright. Witness said sighting occurred at night and sky very blue. Perhaps she thinks that anything after 6 p.m. is night. Must be listed as unknown (meager data, single witness, very short duration).

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire

I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire. I do not seem to find a Bartlett, New Hampshire case. See attached supplemental sheet A.

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.

Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit Dayton.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.

Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Dover Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, all I have is the NICAP report. Evaluation pending my getting a copy of the Air Force investigation of same. Based on NICAP report, the sighting is obviously unidentified.

19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.

I have only the card on this case, but judging from it there seems to be a possibility that this one-witness case was caused by low-flying birds reflecting light. The sighting lasted 4 to 10 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.

I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it
