TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
DATE: 3-11-55 4:02A EST
SUBJECT: BALTIMORE, MARYLAND NEWSPAPER ARTICLE - DAILY SUN

"MAKING BALL FALLS FROM SKY, HAS EXPERTS WONDERING WHY"

A big ball of smoking bubbles descended on South Baltimore yesterday. A crowd of people saw it, and although it was only a few yards in diameter, it created quite a stir.

The only a few yellow stains about the color of sulphur were left, and although the police were called, the bubble had disappeared when they arrived.

The guess - - from an adult - - was that the bubbly phenomenon, one of the two seen simultaneously, came from the planes. Their height was estimated that it came from the planes "higher".

Mrs. Catherine Enright, South Paca Street, said she saw the strange mass of milky matter drifting slowly down at about 11:30 A.M.

She said it was about 25 feet in diameter, and it looked "like a big ball". It fell on the ground across from the Standard Oil and Steel Corporation, and immediately to the nearby lot, smashing through the fence.

Part of it clung to the automobile and was a yellowish stain, and it smelled like sulphur. The ground was scorched by the "heat" and "smoke" came from it, she said, and people could not get near it as it was "too hot".

Captain Arvillas said shortly after the object arrived, two young Negroes G. C. Connell and Edmund Ward arrived from the Southern police station.

Almost immediately from the time it arrived, Captain Arvillas said, "SMOKING BUBBLY PROVES A PUZZLE" (Continued from Page 2).

Captain Arvillas Wallace of the 545th Ordnance Detachment, arrived. He said he had been notified of the incident and made an investigation. He said it was "decidedly strange".

Captain Wallace scraped some of the residue off the car and took it to the police laboratory for examination. He said little of the material left when he got there, he said, that he wasn't sure what he got was the stuff that came down.

BALTIMORE, MARYLAND Newspaper Article - DAILY SUN (Continued)

At the crime laboratory Lieut. Anthony F. Halligan said the substance was crystalline—like crystal shale—and that it resembled what is sometimes sent to Horgue. 

He sent the material to the City morgue, and last night Dr. Henry C. Freimuth, chemist at the laboratory, told him he had not yet seen a check on the material.

He described the material as "a powder" and said there was "about as much as it would take to cover a dime."

Sgt. Charles Ellison, who lives next door to Mrs. Shupe, said the bubbles from the sky were a mystery to him, too.

Mrs. Mamie Deriso, who lives next door to Mrs. Shupe, said she was told the same time as Ellison that the house next door was covered with the bubbles coming from the sky. 

Flower Gromer, who also lives at 1136 South Paca, said he figured the stuff came from a chemical plant. Bobby Shupe, Shupe's son who lives with his parents, said he thinks the material was some kind of fertilizer on the ground.

Approximately 1225, they received call that large "bubble" had landed on PACE drive and the following persons had observed it:
Ida the 1220 drive SABA(? -?)STRANGE, reported to call had FOLLOWED them and landed on PACE. Ida and her husband not named). The object remained at that location, with its top raised, according to eyewitnesses it LOOKED LIKE a detergent soap bubble but was very light in color. About one-half hour later, the object slowly "shrank" down and disappeared, leaving very little residue.
Captain WALLACE said he was able to recover the residue in a folded notebook page, the "Rock-like residue to the CBIRD HANGAR (Bell) where primary analysis determined it to contain both organic and inorganic material with traces of iron crystals. The RESIDUE at the LANDING SITE was the LIGUID type remaining.

industrial operation underway at the MORGUE area at time 1230 was immediately STOPPED and police officials were notified. It was determined that ACID containing a 20 GRAIN CRYSTAL was being dissolved. The operation was associated with CLEANING and WASHING of railroad cars. The formula used in this operation was as follows:
20% OXALIC ACID
80% SODIUM BISULFATE
1% WETTING AGENT
The purpose of the above formula was mixed per gallon of water and subjected to high temperature. This formula has been known to cause a trouble. DOCTOR FREDMOUTH stated that the material in the small containers was the residue that fell off the balloon when he hit it with a strike.

II. RELIABILITY SOURCES were all eye-witnesses of the UFO. Rather than make any subjective evaluation of their reliability, all their statements are here given as they were told to the interviewer. However, their story could not be taken as 100% fact, as she denied having seen the object on the first occasion, and alleged that she did not have the equipment to take a photograph. Her subsequent statements and those of the other witnesses seem to corroborate with each other.

III. SOURCES' DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 23/1723 FEBRUARY 1955 two objects were seen coming from the WEST to the EAST, which is LAST of the aircraft contrail direction. The objects were traveling approximately 700-800 mph at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet, and continued at approximately the same altitude, and about 25 yards to the NORTH. The latter maneuver indicated the objects were under control. The size of the objects was approximately that of a star. It was described as a blue light, and emitted a bluish glow. It then sped off at a very high rate of speed, and landed on the ground. It then lifted off again, and landed again.

A second (second) of people came around to watch it. It was described as:
(1) Resembling cotton candy.
(2) Something like a huge mass of fish eggs.
(3) Bubbly like soap, only much stronger -- there were 20 bubbles that seemed to burst away.

The object was picked up with sticks, and they went right through the mass. When the sticks were withdrawn, no residue was evident. Another unidentified blue-white object similar in size remained 15 on his hand.

While the people watched, the object slowly disintegrated. When it was about two (2) feet in diameter it blew an automobile tire over the area. The tire came from the disappearing object, there were no traces on the tire -- the tire was clean.

III. OBJECT: DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING (Continued)
The residue, as claimed by the owner of the automobile, definitely was deposited by the object. The material was found scattered over the entire portion of the object. No observer tried to collect some of it or attempted identification. The witnesses described the material as a powder similar to that used in fireworks, and in quantities that established.
The color of the object before it disintegrated is doubtful. Stories range from "whitish" to "very colorful" - like a "rainbow". The investigator WILL MAKE NO COMMITMENTS CONCERNING THIS ASPECT UNTIL FURTHER STUDY ESTABLISHES FACTS CONCERNING COLOR CHANGES.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY
After meeting with the aforementioned people plus SERGEANT FOYERS who is handling the case for the SOUTH BALTIMORE POLICE, it is my belief that much of the material did not contain evidence and that the unidentified solid contours pointing toward a strong magnetic field could have been the PERMAG solution used for cleaning railroad cars.
The investigator feels certain that a well-planned covert-to-covert campaign is needed to gather additional data on the extent, company, and formulas of the PERMAG in order to discover the formula by analyzing the contents of the VINYL, as would make a simple solution to determine the product.
As the situation stands in BALTIMORE, some companies have put their own BIO-CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS on insulation of the equipment. The reason for this is that none want unnecessarily publicity about their own company manufacturing or using a substitute resin some people may believe to be a hazardous substance. None of the civilian populace seemed alarmed about the incidents.
AT 02/2030Z MARCH 1955 a call was received by investigator from Mr. CHARLES GILLIS, 3517 GIST AVE BALTIMORE, who wrote with Mr. JENNER in BALTIMORE. Mr. GILLIS discovered that the cleaning compound used by the RAILROAD could possibly shine when it dried, and that it formed a three (3) square feet of scum.
Neither he, nor I, are saying that the object was a job of this froth-like material, but he suggests that the analysts look for either coated scum residue, or sulfate first as the analyzing may disclose the make-up of the material. This may be a clue or starting point in the analysis.
