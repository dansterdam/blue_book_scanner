"SMOKING BALL FALLS FROM SKY, HAS EXPERTS WONDERING WHY

A big ball of smoking bubbles descended on South Baltimore yesterday, drew a crowd of 20 or 25 spectators and, as they watched, slowly disintegrated.

Only a few yellow stains about the color of sulphur were left, and although the police, army ordnance experts and a chemist were called in, neither the course nor substance of the material had been established last night.

One guess—from an adult—was that the bubbly phenomenon, one of the two seen in the area, came from a chemical plant; another guess—from a child—was that it came from the planet Jupiter.

Mrs. Catherine Shupe, of 1226 South Faca street, paid she saw the strange mass of soapy matter drifting slowly down at about 1:30 A.M.

*Sort of Steaming*
She said it was about 2½ feet in diameter, and it looked 'like a big ball of soap suds smoking like dry ice. It was sort of steaming.'

It fell on the ground across from the Seaboard Iron and Steel Corporation, and in floating to the earth it brushed a car owned by Martin Sherry, a Seaboard employe. Part of it clung to the automobile and left a yellowish stain.

Mrs. Shupe said a crowd collected, and children poked the bubbles with pencils. The bubbles kept on steaming, and a man took one of the pencils that had touched the bubble and rubbed it on his hand. He said he felt no pain.

Captain Arrives
Someone eventually thought to call police, and at 1 P.M., shortly after the bubbly part was reduced to stain. Patrolmen George C. Connabel and Edmond Ford arrived from the Southern police station.

Almost immediately thereafter,

(Continuation) "SMOKING BUBBLE PROVES A PUZZLE
(Continued from Page 24)

Capt. Orville Wallace of the 545th Ordnance Detachment, arrived. He said he had been asked by Civil Defense authorities, also alerted by a telephone caller, to make an examination.

Captain Wallace scraped some of the residue off the car and took it to the police crime laboratory for examination. He said the substance was not radioactive.

There was so little of the material left when he got there, he said, that he wasn't sure what he got was the stuff that came down.

BALTIMORE, MARYLAND Newspaper Article - DAILY SUN (Continued)

At the crime laboratory Lieut. Anthony F. Halligan said the substance was crystalline-"like crystals sand"--and he couldn't determine what it was.

Sent to Morgue

He sent the material to the city morgue, and last night Dr. Henry C. Prainuth, chemist at the laboratory there, said he had not yet run a check on the product.

He described the material as "powdery" and said there was "about as much as it would take to cover a dime."

So there the matter rested for the night. But on South Pace street the bubbles from the sky were a mystery that kept folks up late talking.

Mrs. Blanche Defino, who lives next door to Mrs. Chupe, said one that fell appeared "to be a companion to one that went past over the house at about the same time.

Homer Cromer, who also lives at 146 South Pace, said he figured the stuff came from a chemical plant. Bobby Shupe chose Jupiter. "We're studying about planets, and one--Jupiter, I think--has bubbly stuff coming out of the ground."

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE did not see the UFO, but
     received a report on it from CAPTAIN WALLACE of the 549TH ORDNANCE DETACHMENT.
     SOURCE also sent out teletype message AWTOL-2-55 dated 23/1002 FEBRUARY 1955,
     this report was submitted originally to CAPTAIN CHINN (PTO) at 28/2015 FEBRUARY
     1955, who gave it to SOURCE. The report is as follows:

     MEMO FOR THE RECORD:                             28 February 1955

     Received call from CAPTAIN WALLACE, 549TH ORDNANCE DETACHMENT, 3401
     PULASKI HIGHWAY, BALTIMORE, phone MULBERRY 5-8320, EXTENSION 443, who made
     the following report:

     Approximately 1225, they received call that large "bubble" had landed
     in the 1200 block SOUTH PACA STREET. Object had been followed from WESTPORT and
     LOMBARD PACA. Aide had jabbed it with sticks, three stones at it and threw a
     tire on it, but could not break it. Object was about the size of an automobile,
     and looked like a detergent soap bubble but had great elasticity. About one-
     half hour after landing object disappeared leaving very little residue.

     Captain WALLACE said he was able to recover the residue in folded notebook
     page. In look the residue to the CITY HIGHER (lab), where primary analysis
     determined it to contain both organic and inorganic material with traces of
     iron crystals. DR. FREMONT at the McGUIRE has the residue.

I.   SOURCE:    DR. FREMOUTH
        Address: 4501 NORTH CHARLES, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

        Present Position: City Mortician and Instructor of Chemistry
                           at LOYOLA COLLEGE, MARYLAND

        Qualifications:    Doctor of Chemistry

II.  RELIABILITY: DR. FREMOUTH holds two (2) very responsible positions,
     and has the tools and apparatus to determine what certain chemicals and com-
     pounds are composed of. He is considered to be highly reliable.

III. SOURCES DESCRIPTION OF UFOS: DR. FREMOUTH works at the BALTIMORE
     CITY IN THE afternoons. He was contacted by CAPTAIN WALLACE, 546TH ORDNANCE DETACHMENT,
     4901 PULASKI HIGHWAY, BALTIMORE, phone MULBERRY 5-6325, EXTENSION 463.
     CAPTAIN WALLACE had noted to CAPTAIN BOONE reading from the UFB in a notebook,
     and gave it to DR. FREMOUTH for analysis. DR. FREMOUTH found the residue to
     contain both organic and inorganic material, with traces of iron crystals.

     Industrial operation underway at the WESTPORT area at time UFO was
     sighted. WESTPORT is an area approximately six (6) blocks from where the
     UFB landed, and in same direction from which it was coming. Operation
     involved cleaning and washing of railroad cars. The formula used in this
     operation was as follows:

                     20% OXALIC ACID
                     70% SODIUM BISULFATE
                     10% WETTING AGENT

     Four ounces of the above formula was mixed per gallon of water and subjected
     to high pressure. This material upon drying, out will leave a deposit; however,
     it has never been known to cause a bubble. The trade name of the formula above
     is G-2 FREMAX and is manufactured by MAGNUSON PRODUCTS CORPORATION, 50 COURT
     STREET, BROOKLYN, NEW YORK (HURX 0497).

     WESTPORT is heavily industrialized, including several glass companies.

     DR. FREMOUTH stated that the material in the small containers was the
     residue that fell off the balloon when hit with a stick.

II.   RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a tall, well-built man of middle age. He was known by all workers in the BALTIMORE & OHIO headquarters, and was obviously the chief man. He detained two officials of the TEXAS COMPANY to talk with investigator, which indicates his sincerity in wanting to help. The investigator believes SOURCE to be highly reliable.

III. SOURCE stated the PHENOL solution was used to wash down railroad cars. It is acquired from two (2) pipes on each side of the car as it is drawn between them. The solution is kept in large vats nearby the spraying area. SOURCE stated that solution has never been known to react like the described TYPE, but is possible, although not probable. Further information is presently being awaited, and will be added to report if it comes in from MR. [REDACTED] today (2 MARCH 1955).

    (4) Other inhabitants of the 1200 block of SOUTH PACA STREET
        and other workers at the SEABOARD IRON & STEEL
        CORPORATION.

II. RELIABILITY: Sources were all eye-witnesses of the UFOB. Rather than mention what each person stated concerning it, I have correlated all of their stories into the "Description of the Sighting". All were lower-class people, and the investigator believes "no claims could be taken as truth at all, as she denied having even seen the object". The other neighbors, and the newspaper all profess that she was one of the first observers, and crossed the other neighbors for some odd yards.

Investigator believes the Description as related below to be a reliable account of what happened.

III. SOURCES' DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 28/1725 FEBRUARY 1955 two objects were seen going from the WESTPORT AREA, which is EAST of the city, in one object, floating at approximately the same level, continued on, directly across SOUTH PACA STREET and disappeared from view. The other, at approximately the same altitude, and about 20 yards to the NORTH. The latter—mentioned object was large; it was almost the size of a car. It came directly over the roof of the SEABOARD IRON & STEEL CORPORATION, landed on the rooftop of a blue BUICK, two-door sedan belonging to MR. MARTIN STEFELY. It then slid off the car, and landed on the ground.

A crowd (20-25) of people came around to watch it. It was described as:

(1) Resembling cotton candy.
(2) Something like a huge mass of fish eggs.
(3) Bubbly like soap, only much stronger -- there were no bubbles that popped; they seemed to melt away.

The object was poked with sticks, and they went right through the mass. The sticks were witcharm, no residue was evident. Another unidentified bystander stuck a pencil in it, withdrew the pencil, and rubbed it on his hand-- no effect.

While the people watched, the object slowly disintegrated. When it was about two (2) feet in diameter someone threw an automobile tire over it. The tire sank into the object, and when there was no more trace of the ever-disappearing object, there were no traces on the tire -- the tire was clean.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: (Continued)

Some of the observers were inhabitants of the area, and had never seen anything like this before. Several believed that it came from one of the chemical or gas plants nearby. No one seemed alarmed over the incident - merely very inquisitive as to what it actually was.

The residue, as claimed by the owner of the automobile, definitely was deposited by the object, and the enclosed material was the only remaining portion of the object. No observer tried to collect some of it or attempted to take a photograph. The enclosed material was gathered after the object had diminished to nothing.

The color of the object before it disintegrated is doubtful. Stories range from "whitish" to "very colorful -- like a rainbow". Investigator will make no commitments concerning this. However, the fact that, on close observation, the object emitted a smoke similar to steam, seems fairly well established.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY

After meeting with the aforementioned people plus SERGEANT POWERS who is handling the case for the SOUTH BALTIMORE POLICE, it is my belief that such objects did exist, and that the enclosed vials contain residue from one of the objects.

Due to the fact that there are many chemical and glass companies in the area from which the object was blown, it stands to reason that if came from one of them. If not, the BALTIMORE & OHIO RAILROAD COMPANY is still investigating their particular relationship in the affair, and it could have been the PERMAL solution used for cleaning railroad cars.

The investigator feels certain that a vitalized door-to-door campaign in the WEST 3RD INDUSTRIAL area could uncover the formula by an ad company for the product. If ATIC can uncover the formula by analyzing the contents of the vials, it would be a fairly simple matter to determine the producer.

As the situation stands in BALTIMORE, some companies have put their own BIO-CHEMISTS to work on investigations of the phenomenon. The reason for this is that none want incompletory publicity about their own company manufacturing or using a substance which some people may believe to be a "flying saucer". None of the civilian populace seemed alarmed about the incident.

At 02/0300 MARCH 1955 a call was received by investigator from Mr. CHARLES GILEAD, BIOCHEMIST for the BALTIMORE & OHIO RAILROAD who works with MR. SENNIT in BALTIMORE. Mr. GILEAD discovered that the cleaning compound used by his company could froth and bubble when agitated, is white when it does so, and leaves a pale yellow residue -- about 3 a thimble-full per three (3) square feet of foam.

Neither he, nor I, are saying that the object was a gob of this froth-like material, but he suggests that the analysis look for either creslic acid, sodium, or sulfate first in trying to determine the make-up of the material. This may be a lead or starting point in the analysis.
