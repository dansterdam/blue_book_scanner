11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object flying over the runway in a heading of 255 degrees. Appeared to be a formation of five a/c in "W" formation. Flying slowly and appeared to stand still. Object appeared to have 10-12 large red lights. Made several transmissions to A/C in area at time. Witness on duty in tower as operator.

Sounds like birds except for the red lights. No reports from A/C in the area. The witness did not ask the A/C to try and identify the objects. Witness on duty at tower. Considered as insufficient data since additional personnel in tower and A/C in area did not report these objects.
