1. The following information is in confirmation of information previously to your command on 8 January 1955, and, also, to facilitate continuation of your request with investigations.

2. At approximately 2045 hours, 6 January 1955, this office was telephonically informed by 1st LRRTC, 805th Resident Post at MacDill AFB, Fla, that one and two other persons, 1st LRRTC, had observed an object in the air, some of Bradenton, Florida, which they were unable to identify. According to the source, at 2050, the observer and companion were driving north on U.S. Highway 41, two to three miles south of Bradenton, Florida, one of the other several called this attention to a light object.

3. The observer explained that while driving, approximately 1500 feet west of the highway on which they were driving, lights added that during the ten seconds in which this object was visible, two other blinking, colored or bright stars appeared. He exclaimed that the object itself was black and, in size, as estimated that a saucer held at arm's length would have covered the circular object. He further mentioned that the object was stationary, silent, and that he estimates the entire area, the automobile, and the highway, and that he remained in the illumination of a projection with no foreshortening of perspective.

4. That same night, and that other stars were also visible, but that this object was, in his opinion, so star and certainly was not the moon. The observer, who lives near Bradenton, Florida, immediately following the sighting of the unidentified object.
