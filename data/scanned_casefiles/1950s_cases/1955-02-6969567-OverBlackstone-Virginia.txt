The text on this page is largely illegible. I can make out a few partial markings:

Top right corner: "8"

Top right side: 
"3. Alta
3. Altenge
# 4 file"

There is a faint "MEMO" stamp in the top center of the document, and some curved lines/markings, but the majority of the text is not clearly readable.


- page 2 -

Most of the text on this page is too faint or blurry to be reliably read. There appears to be some text on the page, but the image quality is very poor and the text is largely illegible. There is a black redaction or blacked-out section near the bottom of the page.


- page 3 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible. I can make out a few partial lines of text in the middle of the document, but the words are not clear enough to confidently transcribe. At the bottom of the page, there is a notation "80 60" and "NH" which are clearly visible. The rest of the document appears to be very faint or blurry.
