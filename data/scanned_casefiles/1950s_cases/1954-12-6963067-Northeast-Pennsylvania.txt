The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line to represent the horizon, with an "A" mark on the curve. The sketch instructs the viewer to imagine that the object was above the horizon when first seen. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view with a person standing in the foreground, and two smaller circular insets showing different perspectives of the landscape.

Here is the text from the document:

This is the complete report we received from the 14000th with a suspense of 21 Mar 55. It's made a case file of 16 since it has attracted so much attention.

My personal evaluation is as follows:

1. Source's house is located directly on the shore of Lake Erie.
2. On the nights (4 & 5 Dec 54) the obj was sighted, the source stated the weather condition as GOOD, with full moon and no stars visible.
3. My evaluation is that the sighting was as the result of a reflection of a known object, which assumed the particular shape described by the source. It could have possibly been one of two things:
A chip on telescope lens
or
as stated in one of the attached newspaper articles.

This professor with St. Mary's college said he jokingly believes they were space craft which had come to observe the activity in its observatory. WHICH he also said impressed the UTO's could have been mistaken by the WELL-LIGHTED DOMES on his observatory (which could explain the source's report of the UFO having many windows or ports apparently uniformly spaced around the disc.) This evaluation would depend on two things - Was the domes of the observatory lighted at the time of the sighting?
and
How far is the observatory located from the location of the sighting?

Space Ship (Continued from Page 1)
the low glow of a cloud-hidden moon sealed the thing to be suspended or in flight high above, however, its brightness remained steady and blinding white. "It had been a fire," the lady said, "such intensity would have gone wide-spread once the town would have seen it. But no piling up of fire would have made it shine so solid and steady and motionless as what we saw." The light was dim and quiet. By its huge glow the woman related what was seen: she and her husband witnessed a disc-shaped object hovering above the trees not a great distance away. Remaining motionless, not dipping nor daring to drop, nor altering in size, the brightness suddenly seemed to sink or diminish from within, as though the center had vanished or been extinguished. The light then re-gathered itself and sped away silently under its own power. "When it did come, it got to be so far distant in the sky that it was standing still," the witness remarked. She concluded that at the object's greatest distance it "appeared to be a star," but still she knew that it was not a star when she first saw it so close and brilliant above the trees.

Realizing that water distances are tricky to judge, she judged the thing to have been perhaps half a mile to a mile away, appearing very large, though exactly what its size was cannot be estimated. The brilliance of the light, however, made it impossible to make out any details of its form or structure. 

This time it rose gradually straight up and again disappeared.  A similar sighting about a year ago-identifiable at the time, the woman said, "I never considered those things related to one another before today."

Before that," she said, "I never considered those things really like that before, like a Greenish Ball." She was referring to a sighting some years ago (about 1920 in the evening, when a greenish silver-colored object appeared overhead suddenly, hovering near a beam of light, then zooming off too fast for her to pull off on the driveway she was found. she said the ball-like object might be a reflection, but where would the light come from to make such a reflection? Local residents saw the object too.

TOO GENERAL
1. This Center had very little additional information concerning the specific sighting by Mr. 
, however, the case was compared to past incidents with similar circumstances of riolityY, lighting and weather conditions. As a result 
of analyzing this comparison media, it was decided that the case in this instance involved an ambucption of a known rnenomenenation of a known space phenomena, which assumed the particular shape described by the source.
2. Upon examination of the "U.S. Air Technical Information Digest" cempleted by 
the source, it was noted that under Items 5-3, the statement, "3. Moon was out and a
mist'confirmed slightly with items 3.1 - b and 3.3 - a and b. However, it is a
known fact that conditions of either haze or mist,even vater vapor, are inductive to
possibility of misidentification phenomena.
3. As to the identity of the subject involved, two possible explanations
exist. It could have been a reflection of a ship on Lake Erie or a reflection from
an observation dome. This latter possibility results from a statement made in one
of the newspapers included with the report. It is further, Mr. A. Dewdney, Astronomer 
at St. Mary's College, that he believed the object was a reflection from his observatory, which gleamed like the moon of a silvery object by the light of the moon." It must be considered that the object could have been a reflection of the observatory dome depending upon the exact location of the observatory with respect to the source's home.
