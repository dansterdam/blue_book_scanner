"Farmer Tells of Watching G-54 Launch Flying Saucer
Dongola, Mich., July 6 - A young, hardworking farmer not given to
seeing things' has reported watching a flying saucer launched from
an Army G-54.

"John Keller made the report to the Dowagiac newspaper, and said his
two young sons would verify his statements.

"Keller said he watched a saucer shaped like an automobile hub cap,
about 25 feet in diameter and 12 to 15 feet thick, launched from a
low-flying Army G-54 on June 29.

"Keller said the launching took place about a quarter of a mile from
where he was riding a tractor, in a hay field.

"The plane was heading southwest at a low rate of speed, about 300
feet up, when the saucer came from the belly of the plane' he
declared. It sort of robbed, then shot away at a terrific speed,
due south. It easily outdistanced the G-54 and was out of sight in
five seconds."

"It looked like a gigantic hub cap or half of a sphere. It's topside
looked like chrome and had a little dome protruding, and the bottom
was dull gray. I didn't report it sooner because I was afraid my
neighbors might give me the horse laugh.' Keller was with his young
sons, Larry and Johnny, when he saw the launching."
