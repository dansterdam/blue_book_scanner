1. SYNOPSIS: Unidentified airborne object observed in sky over southern shore of island of Oahu, T. H., at 1900 hours Hawaiian Standard Time (HST), 7 January 1951.

2. DETAILS: At 1015 hours on 8 January 1951, [redacted], Honolulu, T. H., was interviewed at that address, and stated in substance as follows:

At approximately 1900 hours (HST) on 7 January 1951, I was sitting in my parcel car at the Kapiolani Drive-In Theater, 1590 Kapiolani Boulevard, Honolulu, T. H. My car was parked, facing the screen, on an approximate east-west line, heading approximately east. At that time, I looked out the open, right-hand window at my car toward the northeast, and observed a large mass of muddy-orange colored flame at an estimated altitude of between two and three thousand (2000-3000) feet and estimated to be over four (4) miles from my point of observation. The mass of flame appeared to no to be similar to the appearance of an oil fire blown by a strong wind. The mass of flame was moving at a very fast rate of speed in an east-to-west direction. I could not distinguish any form of solid body such as an aircraft, but could only see the flames. The mass of flames was observed to be traveling through three (3) clouds; and I

did not see the flames beyond the third cloud. As the moving mass of flames approached the third cloud, I observed a conventional four-engined aircraft apparently coming into Honolulu from the south with landing lights alight. Though, at the time, that the pilot of the approaching aircraft must have seen the mass of flames, and that, possibly, the mass of flames had been an aircraft in distress couldn't be known. I could hear no sound from the unidentified object. The mass of flame appeared to be approximately eight to ten (8-10) times the wing-span of the four-engined aircraft. The mass of flames was visible to me for only a matter of seconds, during which time it traversed a sector of approximately sixty (60) degrees, from time of sighting until disappearing in the third cloud. A conventional single-engine fighter aircraft, flying at three-to-four hundred (300-400) miles per hour would have required approximately five (5) minutes to travel the same distance as the mass of flames (5). The speed of the mass of flames far surpassed the speed of any jet aircraft I have seen. The flames appeared to be lazily fanning out behind the object, or as though the flames were not keeping the same rate of speed as the main body, which I could not discern.

Mr [REDACTED] furnished the following particulars concerning himself as an aid in evaluation of his observation: Born 25 June 1920 at Eagle River, Wisconsin, ten (10) years service in U. S. Army, last with paratroopers unassigned; approximately two hundred (200) hours total flying time, mainly as a passenger; current hobby and former profession as artist, painting, mechanical skill, and has both participated in and judged racing events of midget automobiles and motorcycles; non-instructor; excellent health; normal vision (20/20 in both eyes), although known to be color-blind to red and green.

Mr [REDACTED] further advised that, at the time of the sighting, there was still a trace of light in the sky from the after-glow of sunset, pointing out that it was not pitch-black night. He also indicated that there was no unusual amount of artificial lighting in the immediate vicinity of his point of observation. He said the flames were clearly visible to him, and not a reflection seen in automobile windows or other reflecting surfaces. Mr [REDACTED] said that it was a clear night, and added that the flames were not as bright as a meteor, nor was the path of flight similar to that of a meteor.

Mr [REDACTED] advised that he had been accompanied by his wife and one (1) child, neither of whom saw the mass of flames. Mr [REDACTED] said that he drove to the Honolulu Airport, Honolulu, T.H., at the conclusion of the newly, approximately 1130 hours, and that he inquired of personnel in the pilot-briefing and weather plotting room at the Airport concerning the object he had seen.

end that these people reported that they had received no
information concerning a sighting. Mr said that he had
also called The Honolulu Advertiser and the Honolulu Star-
Bulletin, reporters of the daily newspaper, and had received no
indication of any other reports concerning the sightings.
Mr FENN called the 4th Naval District Intelligence Office
at approximately 0300 hours on 5 January 1951.

public news media or reports of other agencies in the Hawaiian
area. Reference is made to Spot Intelligence Report, File 24-

Investigations, Headquarters USAF, Washington 25, D. C., by
this office, reporting a similar sighting on 24 December 1950.

Flying Sauce' Troubles

Balloon Takes a Trip
Residents of the Wichita Falls area had "flying saucer" troubles again Tuesday, but government ordinance officials said "no such thing."

The object that was seen by literally thousands of West Texans, the government men said, was a balloon released early Tuesday at White Sands Proving Ground, N. M.

That report may end Tuesday's chapter of the saucer tales officially, but some folks around here were skeptical of the explanation.

Too many people saw the mysterious thing. Nearly everybody in Seymour turned out to look at it.

The ball all the way from immediate vicinity of Wichita Falls watched the "balloon"—some of them for nearly two hours.

The pilot of a light plane from Hobbs, N. M., chased the object for more than 100 miles but was able to get no closer than 50 to 75 miles.

The Record News received several calls from wondering witnesses, and calls came also to the Sheppard Air Force Base control tower, the police station, the weather bureau and the Civil Aeronautics Association.

All spectators wanted to stress a common belief—the object was definitely not a balloon. They said.

Reports from various New Mexico and Texas communities told of flying saucer stories, the Associated Press reported. The object moved sharply to the right and left. It jumped to a point down. It even left vapor trails, a report traced to the antics of a jet plane carousing about 100 miles from Artesia, N. M.

The balloon, said the White Sands officials, was released for tracking purposes in connection with conferences in continuation with the guided missile program. Reports started to trickle in from Southeast New Mexico and Southwest West Texas that another flying saucer had been sighted.

It was between 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. that most persons in this area observed the "balloon."

watched the object for nearly 30 minutes as it moved slowly through the sky at a height of 8,000-10,000 feet. It stopped intermittently, he said, then suddenly began climbing straight up until it disappeared at a height of 30,000 to 40,000 feet.

Littrell, an Air Force reservist who is familiar with planes and other aerial objects, said he had seen "a lot of weather balloons go up, but I never saw one go up that fast."

He called a friend, R. B. Smith, a Vernon surveyor, Smith watched the "balloon" through a telescope from his yard.

It was traveling, he said, at an angle from the ground of 44 degrees and 50 minutes and moving northeast. When it began its sudden ascent, the "balloon" seemed to give off a burst of orange flame, Smith declared.

To Littrell and Smith, the object resembled a "tremendous floating light bulb"—shaped like an inverted light bulb with a neck that came to a point. It was aluminum in color.

A "very large" disc traveling eastward at an extreme height was what one resident of Munday say.

Clarence Fox of Lubbock noticed people watching the sky from their yards as he drove from Lubbock to Wichita Falls about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, until he reached Seymour about 5:55 p.m. and saw that nearly everyone in town was looking skyward did he stop.

It was then he saw "an object apparently about 30,000 feet high and shaped much like a top except that it was flat on the bottom. It was giving off a white light" similar to fluorescent lighting."

Fox left Seymour about 6:15 p.m. and stopped about seven miles from there to have another look. He said the object then appeared to be some 50 or 100 miles south of Seymour and traveling at a high rate of speed.

Reaching Wichita Falls, the Lubbock man talked with others who had watched the object all the way from Dickens. "After dark," the driver said, "it seemed to take on a reddish glow."
