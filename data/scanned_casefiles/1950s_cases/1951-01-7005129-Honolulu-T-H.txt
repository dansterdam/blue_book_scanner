1. SYNOPSIS: Unidentified aircraft sighted in P-38 over inhabited area of island of Oahu, T.H. at 1220 hours Hawaiian Standard Time (HST), 7 January 1951.

2. DETAILS: At 1215 hours on 7 January 1951, Lt. H. viewed an extremely bright and metallic appearing object in the sky, which was intermittently motionless and traveling at a high rate of speed. At approximately 1220 hours (HST) on 7 January 1951, I was sitting in my parked car at the Hickam Field Drive-In Theater, 1600 Moanalua Road, Honolulu, T.H., when a large, white, cigar-shaped object passed overhead at a very fast rate of speed, moving in a horizontal path from East to West. The object appeared suddenly, traveled a large mass of muddy-orange colored flame at its trailing edge, and disappeared over the ocean approximately four (4) miles from my position. The size of the object was estimated to be some 40-50 feet long, and the mass of flame trailing it was estimated to be about 25 feet in length. The speed of the object was extremely rapid, and it did not appear to make any sound. The mass of flame was moving at a very fast rate of speed in an east-to-west direction. I could not distinguish any form of solid body such as a fuselage, wing or tail surfaces. The mass of flame appeared to be the only part visible. The object appeared suddenly, traveled through three (3) clouds, and disappeared.

did not see the flames beyond the third cloud. As the moving object approached the third cloud, I observed a cone-shaped object, light brown in color, trailing a tail of flame. The tail appeared to be about 30 feet in length and was trailing from the south with landing lights lighted. I thought, at the time, that the lights of that object might have been the same as flames, and that, possibly, the mass of flames had been the mass of flames had been in a different part of the sky and possibly farther away. I could have no sound from the object at all even though it appeared to be close enough to have been heard.
The object did climb up into the clouds and appeared approximately five (5) minutes to traverse the same distance as previous (5-10) times the speed of my jet aircraft that I have seen. The flames appeared to be momentarily disinterred and then reappeared as described above. The mass of flames was visible to me for only a matter of seconds during which time it traversed the third cloud.
According to airman K., the object would climb approximately 5 (5) minutes to travel the same distance as previously (5-10) times the speed of my jet aircraft that I have seen. The flames appeared to be momentarily disinterred and then reappeared as described above. The mass of flames was visible to me for only a matter of seconds during which time it traversed the third cloud.
Mr. advised the following particulars concerning himself and his capacity in this observation: Is retired (Capt.) United States Army. Sent with paratroopers maneuvers, slightly over two hundred miles northwest of Honolulu T.H. This sighting as a passenger, rather than as a regular observer. At the time I was in normal good and former profession as aerial mechanian, relative mechanics-pilot, some pilot training, who has had special course in observation and taught to write clear, coherent and consecutive reports.
Mr. advised that two days previous, unidentified flying objects were observed over the island of Oahu by personnel at that area. Although his called health normal vision (20/20 in both eyes), although color blind to be color-blindblind to certain greens.
Mr. further advised that, "at the time of the sighting, there was still a trace of daylight in the sky from the setting sun. Unusual lights were noted in the sky over the area approximately 2 hours prior to my sighting. He stated that he waited to make the report until he had an opportunity to discuss the matter with Army Intelligence officers and assure himself that the matter was of official interest before submitting the report. As to the size of the object, he stated that it appeared to be approximately 2 to 3 times the size of a B-29 bomber, which he could easily recognize, and not a reflection seen in automobile windows or other reflecting surfaces, and stated that he got a "side-view" of the object and that the shape resembled that of a mushroom on a stalk."
Mr. advised that he had been accompanied by his wife, and when they saw the object, he called his child's attention to it, but the child did not see it. He stated at the conclusion of the sighting, approximately 30 seconds, and that he inquired of personnel in the plotting room at the Airport concerning the object he had seen.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper article with text and an illustration. The article is titled "Balloon Takes a Trip" and discusses reports of a large object seen in the sky over Wichita Falls, Texas on January 16, 1951. The article describes the sighting and reactions of witnesses, as well as the official response from the Civil Aeronautics Administration.

watched the object for nearly 30 minutes as it sailed high through the sky at a height of 8,000-10,000 feet. It stopped and then started climbing up until it disappeared at a height of around 13,000 feet.

Lunsford, an Air Force reservist, and Smith, his companion, said they had seen "a lot of weather balloons so they never saw anything like it. They said the object moved around erratically and suddenly shot up when it seemed to disappear.

They said hundreds of people watched the "balloon" some of them calling it a flying saucer. The record News received scores of telephone calls from persons who reported seeing the object.

The Civil Aeronautics Administration said the object was not an airplane, helicopter or balloon under its control. It was reported that most persons in this area who observed the "balloon" could not identify it.
