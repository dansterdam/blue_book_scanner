Here is the text from the newspaper article:

NEW YORK HE[RALD]

Sky 'Object' Spotted at A-Bomb Site

WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUND, N. M., Nov. 4 (JP)—The Army today reported that a huge oval object "nearly as bright as the sun" was spotted Sunday hovering near bunkers used in the first atomic bomb explosion.

The sightings were made seventeen hours apart by two different military police patrols on this southern New Mexico missile testing range. The first atomic bomb was touched off on the northern edge of the area July 16, 1945.

First Lt. Miles P. Penney, commanding officer of the M. P.'s, said none of the men had heard radio reports or similar newspaper accounts of similar sightings in Texas yesterday.

Both sightings were in the area of abandoned bunkers used by technicians who observed the world's first atomic explosion.

Lt. Penney said one sighting was made by a two-man patrol consisting of Sgt. 3/c Forest R. Oakes and Sp. 3/c Barlow reported that time their patrol saw a bright light. Special Oakes thought the object was hovering over the old atom bunker. He said the "large bright light took off at a 45-degree angle into the sky and stared blinking." Then it disappeared.

This patrol estimated the object's size as "100 or 300 feet" in diameter and its altitude as about 50 feet above the ground.

Specialist Oakes said. He said his patrol consisting of Cpl. Glenn H. Toy and a Pfc. Wilbanks made his report.

Lt. Penney quoted them as seeing an atom bomb bunkers when it was about fifty yards above the bright, like the sun, then fell in, after and shaped like an egg.

A few minutes later, Col. Toy said, the object descended until it was about 50 to 100 yards in diameter and at an angle to the ground and went out.

He described the object as bright and shaped like an egg.

At approximately 9:30, 5 November 1957, Source together with PFC were on a night patrol of the 13 range area of the White Sands Proving Ground with Source noticed a very bright object high in the air. This object slowly descended to an altitude estimated to be approximately 50 yards where it remained motionless for about 5 minutes, then it descended to the ground more. The object was not blurred, stated no vapor or smoke. The object was in view for about 15 minutes. Source could state that it was approximately 5 or 6 miles distant. It was estimated to be between 75 and 100 yards in diameter and shaped like an egg. Source stated that it was large as a proportional ball at arm's length. The weather was cold, clearing, and windy. Source stated it was very visible. After the light went out, Source continued north to the SW main gate. Source had no explanation for the incident.

HX16A

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., NOV. 4--(UP)--THE SOUTHWEST'S LEADING METEORITICIST, DR. LINCOLN LA PAZ, SAID TODAY HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THE MYSTERIOUS CIGAR-LIKE OBJECT SIGHTED OVER WEST TEXAS AND NEW MEXICO LAST NIGHT CONTAINED "LITTLE PEOPLE FROM MARS OR VENUS."

LA PAZ, HEAD OF THE METEORITES INSTITUTE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO, SAID THE OBJECT WAS "EITHER MAN-MADE" OR COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO "METEORIC PHENOMENON."

HE SAID STORIES OF THE POSSIBILITY OF A "SPACE SHIP" FROM ANOTHER PLANET MOTIVATED BY MAGNETIC FIELD FORCES "HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY SCIENTISTS." BUT HE INDICATED IT WAS "ENTIRELY POSSIBLE" THAT THE OBJECT WAS MAN-MADE.

LA PAZ SAID HE WAS RECEIVED CALLS TODAY FROM "THROUGHOUT THE AREA" MADE BY PEOPLE WHO REPORTEDLY SIGHTED THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT. AMONG THEM WERE METEORITE WATCHERS WHO OBSERVED THE RED, CIGAR-SHAPED PHENOMENON THROUGH "BREAKS" IN AN UNUSUALLY CLOUDY SKY.

CIGAR-LIKE OBJECTS AND OTHER SUCH OBJECTS, GLOWING RED, GREEN, AND PRACTICALLY EVERY COLOR OF THE RAINBOW, HAVE BEEN SIGHTED OVER THE SOUTH WESTERN DESERT FAIRLY FREQUENTLY WITHIN THE LAST 10 YEARS.

LA PAZ SAID ALL REPORTS, INCLUDING THOSE MADE TODAY, WERE FORWARDED TO THE OFFICIAL GROUP AT WRIGHT PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE IN OHIO WHICH IS INVESTIGATING SUCH PHENOMENON.

As for the White Sands sightings, the AF explanation speaks of "lights seen by planes patrolling the area." This is the first mention anywhere of planes; all the newspaper accounts said lights were seen by two two-man jeep patrols - by one at 3 a.m. and by another at 8 p.m. the same day (Nov. 3). Didn't the AF know about the jeeps? Did it know about them and prefer to ignore them, and why? Or were they merely being careless about this $10,000 facts? Were the lights also seen by plane? Whatever the reason for this discrepancy, we can test the AF conclusions against the reports of the jeep observers. Says the AF: "The reports of the plane pilots were apparently explainable by the planet Venus in an unusually favorable position for observation, or by cloud formations around the moon." So far as the jeeps are concerned, the first explanation is all wrong and the second is preposterous. Venus is NEVER visible at all at 3 o'clock in the morning, and on November 3 it had set at 7:30 p.m., half an hour before the second jeep patrol saw anything. As for the alternate explanation suggested, the soldiers' descriptions of what they saw (page 2) indicates that such celestial acrobatics of "cloud formations around the moon" (in New Mexico's notoriously clear skies) were never seen before nor since.

The West Texas reports were only hours old when sightings were made independently by two Army patrols in the old A-bomb testing range outside of the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. The first incident occurred at 3 a.m.; a two-man jeep patrol, consisting of Sgt. [redacted] and Pfc. [redacted], watched a "very bright" egg-shaped object, about 75 - 100 yards in diameter, descend from the sky until it was about 50 yards above the old atom bunkers, then it went out. Suddenly it flared up again brilliantly, "like the sun, then fell in an angle so the jeep were noticed. Seventeen hours later, at 8 p.m., Specialists 3/c [redacted] about 50 feet above an old bunker, 200 or 300-foot light" hanging motionless started blinking; then it disappeared. None of the men in either patrol had known of the Levelland reports.
