The text describes sightings of an unidentified aerial object near an atomic bomb site in New Mexico. It mentions that the object was spotted by multiple observers and was seen for around 5 minutes. The text also mentions that "specialists" were called in to investigate the sighting.

MT. APPROVED INDEX CARD
NOV 7 1957
THIS IS A SPECIAL REPORT CONCERNING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING OBSERVED IN DUNEDIN, FLORIDA ON OCTOBER 27, 1957.
THIS REPORT WAS SUBMITTED BY JAMES E. MCDONALD, A COLLEGE PROFESSOR WHO WORKS AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, TUCSON, ARIZONA.
MR. MCDONALD WAS DRIVING ALONG COUNTY ROAD 580 BETWEEN DUNEDIN AND TARPON SPRINGS, FLORIDA ON OCTOBER 27, 1957 AT APPROXIMATELY 9:50 P.M. WHEN HE OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY WHICH APPEARED TO BE MOVING ACROSS HIS LINE OF SIGHT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.
THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 10-15 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND WAS MOVING AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED, ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 3-5 TIMES THE SPEED OF A CONVENTIONAL JET AIRCRAFT.
THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 15-20 SECONDS BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.
MR. MCDONALD REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE EMITTING A BRIGHT YELLOWISH-WHITE LIGHT AND DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY WINGS, TAIL, OR OTHER VISIBLE APPENDAGES.
AFTER OBSERVING THE OBJECT, MR. MCDONALD CONTINUED ON HIS WAY AND ARRIVED AT HIS DESTINATION IN DUNEDIN, FLORIDA.
MR. MCDONALD IS A HIGHLY QUALIFIED OBSERVER AND HIS REPORT IS CONSIDERED TO BE RELIABLE AND ACCURATE.
THIS SIGHTING IS BEING FORWARDED TO PROJECT BLUE BOOK FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND EVALUATION.

The text in the document is as follows:

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - NOV. 4 - (UP) - THE SOUTHWEST'S LEADING METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION, THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO'S DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS, LAST NIGHT REPORTED SEVEN UNUSUAL "FLYING SAUCERS" OVER ALBUQUERQUE, ROSWELL AND NEW MEXICO LAST NIGHT.

THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY PHYSICS DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL AT 9:00 P.M. MST. THEY REPORTED THE SEVEN OBJECTS WERE EITHER "MAN-MADE" OR COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE UNIVERSITY'S BALLOON-BORNE METEOROLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS RELEASED FOR UPPER AIR OBSERVATIONS.

DR. LINCOLN LAPAZ, HEAD OF THE UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE OF METEORITICS, SAID THE OBJECTS OBSERVED LAST NIGHT WERE NOT A RESULT OF BALLOONS OR METEORS, AND THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR BEING "FLYING SAUCERS" COULD NOT BE ELIMINATED. HE SAID THEY WERE REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN SIGHTED OVER ALBUQUERQUE, ROSWELL AND OTHER CITIES IN NEW MEXICO.

LAPAZ SAID THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING AT A SPEED ESTIMATED AT FROM 600 TO 700 MILES PER HOUR, AND THAT SOME UNUSUAL MANEUVERING CHARACTERISTICS WERE NOTED, SUCH AS SUDDEN CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND SPEED.

HE SAID A TEAM FROM THE UNIVERSITY WOULD MAKE A FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT. SUCH A SPEED WOULD BE FAR IN EXCESS OF ANY KNOWN AIR VEHICLE, HE SAID.

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a text document from Project Blue Book. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

As for the White Sands sightings, the AF explanation speaks of "lights seen by planes" - in a most unsatisfactory way. This is the newspaper people account, said "lights were seen by man" (now the AF doesn't know about that? then why don't they know about the 10,000 facts? Were the lights also seen by planes? The newspaper people say they were.

The West Texas reports were only hours old when sightings were made independent of the White Sands project. The ground observers in the old A-bomb testing areas outside of the White Sands Proving Ground, observed very bright blueish-white, egg-shaped objects, about 75-100 yards in diameter, descend from very high altitude, it went out of sight about the same altitude it entered, they said. "It came straight down," "no traces were found," and "no unusual effects on the men" were noticed.

In one case, an old bunker, the light "took off" at a 45-degree angle and appeared to disappear. None of the men in either patrol had known each other, and started biultining when it disappeared. More of the men in either patrol had known each other, and started biuliting when it disappeared.
