SUBJECT: Photographs Submitted for Evaluation

TO:   Commanding Officer
        Air Technical Intelligence Center
        1125th HQ USAF Field Activities Group
        Wright-Patterson AF Base, Ohio

1. Mr. [redacted] residing at [redacted] Downey, 
California, visited this Headquarters today and delivered three photo-
graphs that he thought might be of interest to the Air Force. They 
are attached hereto. All three of these photographs were taken of the 
same scene and when developed, the one showed objects in the sky that 
were not apparent on the other two.

2. Mr. [redacted] is aware of the fact that the developing process 
might have brought about an imperfection, but because the spots are 
regular in appearance and for whatever value might be attached to them, 
he thought they should be delivered to an Air Force representative. 
Recent issues of Life Magazine showing pictures of so-called "flying 
saucers" prompted his thought.

3. The following information was obtained from Mr. [redacted] with 
regard to these photographs:

    a. Mr. [redacted] is in business for himself selling building 
    supplies and hardware. He has no connection with any contractor doing 
    business with the Air Force.

    b. His phone number is [redacted].

    c. The pictures were taken from Griffith Park planetarium, 
    Griffith Park, Los Angeles, California on 20 April 1952, about an hour 
    and a half after-dark.

Ltr to Air Tech. Intelligence Center, 1125th Hq USAF Fld Activities
Gp, W-P AFB, Ohio, dtd 1 May 52, Subj: Photos Submitted for Evaluation.

d. At the time these pictures were taken, Mr. was
accompanied by his wife and another couple visiting them from Wichita,
Kansas. None of those present remember seeing anything in the sky, but
they were looking at the scenery rather than in the sky.

e. The pictures were taken of the Hollywood "lights" at
night time, in a direction as near as can be determined, West South
West of the Griffith Park planetarium.

f. The pictures were taken about 15 to 20 seconds apart.
Three were taken because Mr. wanted to be certain that there
was an adequate recording of these lights.

g. Exposure time was 1/25th at a lens opening of 5.6.

h. Pictures were taken on a Kodak model 35.
