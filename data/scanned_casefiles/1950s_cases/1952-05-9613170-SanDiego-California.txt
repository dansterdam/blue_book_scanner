Here is the text I can read from the document:

9 JUNE 52
LOCATION
DIRECTION OF MOTION

[There is a small box with partially legible text on the right side of the page, but the text is too blurry to confidently transcribe.]

The document contains a hand-drawn sketch or illustration that appears to be of an object with two lighter circular areas against a darker, crosshatched background. There is also a small arrow labeled "DIRECTION OF MOTION" next to the sketch.

At the bottom of the page, there are some handwritten characters that are partially obscured, but appear to read something like "HAVE 2" or "HAVE L2".
