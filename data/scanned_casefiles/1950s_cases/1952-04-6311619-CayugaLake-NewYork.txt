Text from the document:

To whom it may concern:

This is to comply with a request made in the April 7th issue of Life Magazine in an article relative to Flying Saucers, etc., which asked that any persons seeing such objects notify their nearest Air Force installation - which, in this case, is yours.

On the evening of Thursday, April 3, my husband who is a Crew Chief at Robinson Airlines and has been engaged actively in aeronautics for 12 years, part of which was with the AAF, and a friend who is a school teacher and I were traveling in an automobile north along the east shore of Cayuga Lake when at a point about 7 miles from the city of Ithaca at 9:10 PM we saw a "fireball" cross Cayuga Lake in an arc traveling very rapidly from Northeast to Northwest. It was a sizable ball of fire, green in color with green flames streaking out.

This information was not forwarded sooner because I had not read the article and noted the request until today.

Very sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
