11 October 50 12/05/42 Lark, Utah
Civilian
Astro (METEOR)
Evaluated as a meteor observation.
Observer thought object was a meteor, but upon closer observation, believed it to be a object which appeared at first as a long, thin line or fire crossing the sky at a certain rate of speed. This line of fire lasted for approximately 2 to 3 seconds and then became a flaming object which suddenly broke away and shot in an opposite direction. The from end of the object broke away and the main body continued on in a straight line, disappearing from view.

ALEXANDER D. McKANE
New York, N.Y.
Congratulations on your NICAP article - the most sensible thing I have seen in SAUCER NEWS in ages. When NICAP was first organized, I was excited that we might soon contact ed by several crack-dots, and was sorry I never got into the thing. Our little group here in Chicago seized on NICAP several months ago, and when we read in his bulletin that he was going to sell the "*****-books," I think Major Keyhoe means well, but he sure hasn't done the job we expected of him.
RUTH KUHNEN

You've done it again with your NICAP article, I never thought you'd have the nerve to attack that bunch...but I see you did...In my opinion SAUCER NEWS is the only antidote to that sick thing without fear or favor...JOHN KETALLWLCH

THE CASE OF THE CRASHED UFO
- by Bob Berry, News Director of Radio Station WINS, Orleans, N.Y.

During the week of March 17th, 1958, I received some very important saucer information from one of Orleans' most respected persons, the Chief of Police. I will tell you what he told me. 

During my visit to the station that day, the Chief and I got into a chat about UFO sightings which occurred during March 20th. In the course of the conversation, Chief Finger asked me if I had ever heard of a certain incident that occurred in Pennsylvania some time between September of 1949 and January of 1951. It happened that I knew nothing about it. The details were scarce but enough was there to indicate that something unusual did occur. 

He told me that an Air Force man witnessed the landing of a UFO and that it scared off the tops of trees. I was also told that the saucer and its crew made an impression in the soft earth (a hillside section) where they landed. Several Army trucks. They roped the area off, loaded the object on trucks, and drove through.

That was enough for me! I made up my mind to follow this story through. Here is more of the events that followed. 

Several people in the area were supposed to have seen the object as it came down. A considerable portion of the area was cordoned off by the military as a restricted area. A young boy who lived in Empporium at the time. He was supposed to have seen an Army truck pick up the object and take it away. The object was, and he thought the Army truck he saw was from Baltimore, Maryland. The allegation was that the Cameron County Press Independence in Empporium supposedly carried this story.

My next move was to call the editor of that paper, James Klier, I told him of my findings and asked him to check his files to see if he had anything on this. That same afternoon, I received the reply. He told me that the only thing for the period of September 1951 was a weather balloon that was found near Keating Summit on Friday, October 13th, 1950. He said it contained the instrument and differed greatly from the object I had described, being a minimum or less in size. The panels had two small batteries and a light bulb. The equipment was turned over to the Air Force.

I next called a Mr. Fish, Sr. who is associated with the Couder-port Enterprise. After I informed him of my findings, he told me that he had a vague recollection of the incident, but that is gave me no more the name of the Airman. He is giving me the name of a certain Taylor, who now works at the Genna Printing Co. at Genna, Ohio.

My next contact was with Betty Freeh of Orleans, N.Y. a reporter for the Bradford Era of Bradford, Pa. Bert had been in this vicinity for a good many years and if the Bradford paper carried anything on the story, he would remember it locally. After telling him of my findings, I was informed by him that he could not remember the story. However, he suggested that I contact Mrs. Donehue, the librarian at the County Historical Society, who he said had been interested in UFO incidents. She told me that she was unaware of the object and said that she could not recall anyone connected with the government who had the object at Keating Summit, which was supposed to have had printing on it which said: "Anyone finding this, return it to the U.S. Government". It is not known if there was an address on it otherwise.

The text in the document is as follows:

"than the above phrase. According to the article
the U.S. Government came to the area, roped it off,
and closed all news sources on the event. Government
trucks moved in j and she was told witnesses to every-
thing moved out.
On March 24th, 1958, I wrote a letter to the ex-editor of the
Gouderaport weekly newspaper.. After telling him of my interest
in his life had returned from correspondence. She was a friend
tell weeks, I called the long-distance from Geneva, Ohio,
and told him I had returned from correspondence. She was a friend
of Mrs. Dorrell whom he had told about something he had seen.
She also checked on the story, which did not appear in the paper
at the time but appeared in the paper about one I had came across
for clipping purposes. I told him I would appreciate a reply from
him within a week if possible. I am still waiting for his reply.
Throughout a series of phone calls I picked up the fact that a wit-
ness allegedly heard a noise while working on his farm. He then heard an ex-
plosion and started running to the vicinity of the noise came from. This
man's name is he had moved, and at the time he lived near Hammonton,
since the incident (the man has moved from his location)
I made long-distance telephone calls too find an informed source,
a very good friend of the person I contacted regarding the first news-
case,. Point Pleasant Boro, New Jersey, (but he has neglected to get the first name in my
long-distance telephone conversation with him
the charges were made of nothing), and they got to the object before .
the police did. He and two people he brought with him, supposedly were
told to be quiet about the story. (A farmer named D. S. wept, that he
was supposedly watching in the vicinity, and they got to the object before
the police did. He is reportedly an employee of the U.S. Government, and
was to be quiet about the story."

HOW MUCH LIKE US?
- by Justin Case -

In November 1957, the magazine "This Week" (a supplement to many Sunday newspapers) contained an article entitled "What Will Invaders from Space Look Like?" The article, by astronomer Justin Case, gives his thoughts on what visitors from space will probably be like. Mr. Case thinks visitors from space will be less than 250 pounds, possess a skull, two eyes, two ears, and hands and feet. They will probably be extremely intelligent, much more so than "homo sapiens next door," said Mr. Case, so that "the chances are you wouldn't even give them a second look."

Mr. Case says that most of the "millions and millions of stars or suns" most of which have planets. Our invaders from space will undoubtedly come from some number of these millions of planets. The inhabitants of these planets, says Mr. Case, will be interested in studying all possible forms of life, containing all possible forms of life, only one form of which is likely to be our own that "you wouldn't even give them a second look." And this form of life, according to Mr. Case, will not impress our space visitors much, as our entertainment stories (saucer contact stories) indicate we are "easy marks" to look like us. He says that any strange-looking person they see might be a visitor from space. At the same time, most of the visitors from space are having anything but "human form."

The better class of astronomers, who are intelligent, imaginative, and well-educated. Much of their science-fiction is based on science conducted scientifically, so, of course, do not think their stories more interesting than the more likely to be right, Mr. Case or the science-fiction writers. For the danger to our existence is not from the stranger science-fiction or fantasy, but from the science of Biology (the study of life) and one of its branches, the study of Evolution, the processes and laws governing the development into more complex and higher forms, adapting themselves to changes in their environment during the process of Evolution we obtain the following:

almost limitless ... Many different forms of life thrive side by side, in the ocean depths and on tops of mountains, for instance, will be amazed at the variety of life to be found there.

(2) life is very persistent and tenacious, existing even under seemingly impossible conditions. Thus, vegetable and animal life are found under ice-caps, and even under ocean bottoms.

It is very difficult to kill off, as anyone who has tried, different forms of animate (living). Torpid animals, such as cave bears, may be enclosed hermetically, a turtle withdraws into its shell, a horse fights with its hoofs. Other animals protect themselves only by means of their speed, like the rabbit. Thus evolution is rapid, though (aided toward the extinction. Perhaps that is why many prehistoric animals are now extinct.

(3) Man, the only animal on Earth intelligent enough to develop the power of reasoning and record his observations, is rapidly outpacing, in destructive power, other forms of life, which, in time, may lead to extinction.
