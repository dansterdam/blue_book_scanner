10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A/C noticed amber light off wing tip. Made 3 360 deg turns and light maintained position, then object moved to upper right while A/C still in turn. A/C then leveled off and light got smaller. Appeared directly ahead of A/C at this time. Then object headed toward A/C rising slowly until it became too small to see. Personnel watching balloon did not observe A/C in Area of Balloon.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☑ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☑ Other: UNIDENTIFIED
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown

COMMENTS
Possibility of internal reflections as object remained off wing tip through 3 360 deg turns. Balloon in area. Astro bodies visible could account for portion of sighting. 1. Balloon (Rising portion)
2. UNIDENTIFIED Object.

SUMMARY: (Give condensed summary of report. Give disposition in final memorandum. List inclosures in lower left. Indicate if report contains photos or sketches.)

1. At approximately 1710/1, 1 February 1951, an F-82 aircraft of the 339th
Fighter (AW) Squadron, attached to the 6162nd Air Base Wing, Johnson Air Base
(350 51N - 1390 25E) took off to fly airborne alert.

2. At a position approximately one (1) mile south of Johnson, heading 6900
at an altitude of 6000', an F-82 appeared to be larger than a wing tip
light was sighted at eleven o'clock level. The F-82 turned left and the light also
appeared to turn left. Through a series of turns (3) or more (4) 360° turns to the
left, the light appeared to remain off the last wing tip. Suddenly it changed to
a position of two (2) o'clock high while the aircraft was still turning left. At
this time the F-82 was at an altitude of 3000'. Immediately after the change in
position of the light, the aircraft leveled off. The light became smaller and at
levels off, the light appeared smaller and at the 12 o'clock position. Suddenly
the light appeared to reverse its course and head toward the F-82, but very slowly
and high as it was reasonably vertically until the light became too small to see.

3. The position of the aircraft at the time the light disappeared was approxi-
mately five (5) miles south of Johnson Air Base. Indicated air speed was 200 knots.

4. Pilot and radar observer stated that at all times the light
appeared to have complete control of its movement. At no time were they able to
see a silhouette.

5. Weather at time of sighting was clear with no moon. Surface winds were
250° at ten knots. At 6000' winds were 320° at 40 knots and at 14,000' winds were
310° at 54 knots.

6. The Meteorological Section of the 64th AAA Gun Battalion, which is located
on Johnson Air Base, released a weather balloon at 1315/1 on 1 February 1951. The
balloon was visible for ten (10) minutes during which time it rose to 11,000 feet and
was 11,300 yards horizontal distance from the point of release. At no time did the
personnel observing the balloon see an aircraft in its vicinity.

7. The pilot and radar observer stated that they had observed another aircraft
which was approaching Johnson Air Base prior to sighting the light.

8. The Tactical Control Center had good contact with the F-82 but at no time did another blip appear on the scope.

COMMENT

9. The time of release of the weather balloon suggests that it was a "PIBALL" type balloon which is equipped with a candle or searchgas an electric light that can be seen at an altitude of 30,000' by an observer on the ground using a theodolite.

10. The sudden change of position of the light from nine (9) o'clock level to two (2) o'clock high may be attributed to losing sight of the light and in turn sighting a bright star. This star may have disappeared behind a cloud or haze causing the observers to conclude that the light was actually part of a sight.

11. The Tactical Control Center, while having good contact with the aircraft, would not be able to detect this balloon on its radar scope.

12. The position of the aircraft at the time the pilot and radar observer lost sight of the light and its position at the balloon at the time the ground observers lost sight of the balloon are approximately the same.

13. A check by the 616nd Air Base Wing indicated that there were no other aircraft airborne in the area other than the two mentioned.

14. This headquarters concurs in the evaluation as placed on this report by Lt. Colonel Dowd, Intelligence Officer, 616nd Air Base Wing. Lt. Colonel Dowd is an efficient and well trained Intelligence officer and continuously exercises sound and mature judgment in matters of this nature.
