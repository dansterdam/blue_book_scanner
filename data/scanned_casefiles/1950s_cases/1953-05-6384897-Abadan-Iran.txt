11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Circular shaped object flying at very high altitude. Circumference greater than the moon. Appeared in S.W. and disappeared in N.E. During approximately 20 minutes. Had a trackable trail. Could not have been a rocket because no smoke was trailing.

COMMENTS: Likely there is an error in the duration reported. Description of the object as having a combustible tail and complicated with rocket kinetics a much greater speed than would be associated with an object viewed for 20 minutes. Deception of the object and the many observers indicates a meteor observation. Duration considered to a in error.

ATIC DOCUMENT 126061, Iran

1. Tehran newspapers reported that on 18 May 53 at 1805 local time (1357) at Abadan, 30°20'N-48°16'E, an unidentified flying object was seen by most of the population.

2. The object was circular in shape and flew at a very high altitude. Observers stated that the altitude seemed to be equal to the moon, with the circumference greater than that of the moon. The object, called a flying saucer by the Tehran press appeared in the northwest, flew on a northeasterly course and disappeared after 20 minutes. One paper reported that the object had a comet-like tail, another paper quoted NTOC personnel as saying that it was not a rocket because there was no smoke following it.

3. At present no reports have been received of the object from other cities in Khuzistan.

ATIC COMMENT: Insufficient data, perhaps caused by meteorological activity.

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

Here are the comments on the recent batch of material. A few cases are certainly of considerable interest. Over all, in this batch, Venus counts for only one: 28 January, Statuary. Fireball probably accounts for 4 cases [balloons] for four and aircraft for three.

Coming to the interesting cases: the Korean 20 April should certainly be followed up. This comes very close to being a security-intelligence matter. I'd certainly like to get more information on this. How about sending a few Form A's to Korea. Actually, this should have been investigated on the spot by Intelligence officers.

Peppermill AFB 2 May: This has some similarities to the old German case. Much fuller reports needed and Form A filled out on this.

San Antonio 7 May: This has many similarities to the Lubbock Lights and Form A should certainly be sent. This has not already been done.

Finally, a Form A for the 29 April Syracuse stationary-disc sighting would help.

The Miami 20 May green light sighting might have been jets but with the green light sighting, jets should have been traveling north instead of south in order for observers to see green lights. A second time interval also seems too fast. I hope that you can eventually send me more information on these: 20 April Korea; 2 May Peppermill; 7 May San Antonio.

I am enclosing my version of a report on our recent trip with which I hope you will concur.

And keep 'em coming. It's easier to handle a few at a time and frequently than a larger batch at longer intervals.

Jennie send her regards.
