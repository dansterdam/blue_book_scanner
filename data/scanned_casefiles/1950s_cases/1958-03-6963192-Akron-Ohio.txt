Thank you for sending us samples of the material turned over to
you by Mr. [redacted]

We have analyzed the material and find that it is strips of foil
known as "Chaff", which is used in connection with radar operations
as a jamming device, and also to test radars. The material you submitted probably was dropped from Air Force aircraft during trading
exercises.
