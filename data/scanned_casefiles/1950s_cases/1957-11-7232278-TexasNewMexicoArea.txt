ASTRONOMY

Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the southwestern sky these evenings is a dark-red ball in not an airplane, a flying saucer, or an experiment. What you see is the planet Venus, now reaching its most prominent prominence, which comes just before its disappearance from the evening sky early in 1958.

Venus is far brighter than any other star or planet in the sky, and it is no difficulty in identifying it. Indeed, it can be observed long before the sky is dark. In fact, if you know where to look, you can even see it in broad daylight!

After it passed behind the sun last April, Venus has gradually been drawing to the east of that body. That means that it will follow the sun in its daily motion across the sky, and so remained visible in the west after the sun had set. On Nov. 18 it will be farther east of the sun, hence remaining visible in the evening sky for the longest time after sunset, nearly three hours. After that it will start moving toward the sun again.

Because of its early setting, Venus does not appear on the accompanying map of the sky at the same time as the other planets. Their appearance about 10:00 p.m., your own kind of standard time, at the first of November, 9:00 p.m. on the 15th and 8:00 p.m. on the 30th.

Bright Birds in the Sky

These maps do, however, show the stars that are now visible.

Toward the west is Deneb, at the top of the "northern cross," which is really part of the constellation of Cygnus, the swan. Deneb is in the bird's tail; in fact, the word is Arabic and means "tail." The conspicuous part of the swan, and these lower part of the bird, is stretched forward in flight. At the head is Albireo, a star of the second magnitude on the astronomical brightness scale. Below Cygnus is another first-magnitude star, Vega, in Lyra, the harp. To its left is the bright star Altair, with the star Aquila, the eagle.

High in the south you can see the four stars that form the "great square," part of the constellation of Pegasus, the winged horse. Although these are not among the brightest, their characteristic arrangement makes them easy to recognize. Actually, is a typical downward arrangement. The horse, which to find other groups, is low, with Aquarius, a wavy line of stars extending westward from the lower right corner of the square in the head.

The star at the upper right, Alpheratz, is

not in Pegasus at all, but in the neighboring group of Andromeda. The constellation represents the Ethiopian princess who, according to mythology, was chained to a rock to be devoured by a sea monster, represented by the constellation of Cetus, the whale. In the sky, she is near her mother, Cassiopeia, and near the hero, Perseus, who is seen in the northern sky.

Andromeda's mother, Cassiopeia, is seen in the north, a group forming the letter M, above Polaris, the pole star. Alongside her is her husband, the king Cepheus.

Turning now toward the east, we can see what is generally considered to be the finest constellation in the sky making its debut for the season.

Orion Season's Finest

This is Orion, the warrior, easily recognized because of the three stars in a row that form his belt. To the left is Rigel, to the right is Betelgeuse, although Betelgeuse is not as bright as Rigel, both of the first magnitude, although being to low in the sky do not appear as bright as they will in the coming months. Then passing them high in the south will be Sirius, the brightest star in the sky.

Just above Orion is Taurus, the bull, brilliant Aldebaran, and in the left top first magnitude Auriga, the charioteer, with that magnificent star Capella.

Although only Venus is now visible in the evening sky, other planets appear in Jupiter, in the constellation of Virgo, to the southeast before sunrise. Brightest of these is Venus, of course, close to the bright star Spica.

However, it exceeds the star in brightness only before sunrise. Further east in Mars, rising about 30 hours ahead of the sun. Its brightness is about half that of Spica. Mercury and Saturn are both too near the sun to be easily visible in November.

Shower of "Stars" to Come

November is the month bringing one of the year's famous showers of meteors, the Leonids, which appear from about the 13th to the 16th.

They are most numerous after midnight, because then we are on the forward side of the earth in its annual movement around the sun. Thus, we meet them head-on. This is different from the evening look, when we are on the rearward part, and only those that catch up to us are seen.
