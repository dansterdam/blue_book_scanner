7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
8 seconds

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One object round, colored like a star. However, when object turned to North it had a tail which was like a red flame. Its length was about five times the diameter of object. Object traveled at high rate of speed and constant until it disappeared. No change in speed.

at sea 215 Mi SE of Bermuda

6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
North

11. COMMENTS
Meteor sighting. Apparent change in course of object could be caused by passage of object into atmosphere-conditions conducive to distortion, such as an inversion. Also burning appeared to be in two phases, initial glow and then burning with tail.

Ser 173 323-6

1 FEB 1956

From: District Intelligence Officer, SIXTH Naval District
To: Director of Naval Intelligence
Subj: Unidentified Flying Objects; Report of sighting of
Ref: (a) ONI Instruction 03820.19B (NIRM 2)
     (b) ONI Instruction 03820.17C (NIRM 13)

1. Personnel of this office determined, on boarding the Danish vessel DANFJORD on 25 January 1956, to effect coverage in accordance with references (a) and (b), that the ship's Second Mate, apparently reliable, had sighted an unidentified flying object on 21 January 1956 at 0804Z. The ship was at position, latitude 29°-40'N, longitude 60°-00'W, or approximately 210 miles southeast of Bermuda, on true course 252°, speed 13 knots at the time of the sighting. The moon had just gone down, the weather was clear with many stars visible, and visibility was at least 15 miles. The wind was off the port bow at 6 knots. There were no planes, ships, or other objects in the area.

2. When first sighted, the object was at a 260° azimuth at a position angle of 60° and falling and was thought to be a "trailing star." When it reached a position angle of 20°, still at an azimuth of 260°, the object hovered for one or two seconds and was seen to be not a star or meteor confirming to central flight. The object then made an abrupt right angle change of direction to the north, paralleling the horizon at position angle 200, and disappeared about 4 seconds later at azimuth 342° (ship's path-base). While falling, the object appeared to be round and a light color like a star. No "tail" was seen. Its appearance did not change when the object hovered or stopped, or headed directly toward or away from the observer with no change in heading. When the object changed flight to a northerly direction, however, a long "tail" was clearly seen. This "tail" or trailing section, was red like a flame, and its length was about five times the diameter of the body of the object, which still appeared to be round and a light color like a star.

3. The observer hesitated to estimate the distance to the object at any time, but said that if he had to guess he would say that it was 20 miles

away at the time it hovered. When the object departed in a northerly di-
rection, there was no visible acceleration. That is to say, it had a very
high rate of speed at the start and continued at this speed until it went
out of sight or disappeared.

4. The Second Mate is a Danish citizen, about 35 years old, and has 15
years experience at sea. In describing the object, he likened its northern
flight to a rocket, such as a V-2 type, which he said he had seen during
World War II. He stated, however, that he had never seen a celestial or
man-made object which could be compared to this object in performance or
the ability to change its appearance from that of a falling star to that
of a rocket.

5. The foregoing data, including figures, was taken from the log of the
DANJOHN (DA) and is submitted to the Office of Naval Intelligence for in-
formation.
