AF FORM 112-PART 1
APPROVED JUNE 1948

UNCLASSIFIED

COUNTRY: United Kingdom
REPORT NO: JDL-1-55

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report (UFOB)
AREA REPORTED ON: London, England
DATE OF REPORT: 22 June 1955
PREPARED BY (OFFICE): Major W.E. Blakeslee

FROM (Agency): Director of Intelligence, Hq Third Air Force
DATE OF INFORMATION: 25 May 1955
SOURCE: US Civilian
EVALUATION:

SUMMARY:

1. On Wednesday, 25 May 1955 at 22:15 [redacted] Photo recce unit, board of Trade F.O. 2 London stood in public passage way overlooking gardens adjacent to Sydney Road, London N-4 (North Hackney Area) of Derby Road, just returned by bus from a walk and had on hand a pair of 3 x 30 fieldglasses (binoculars).

Climbing (without the glasses) at the north-west sector of the sky he saw, that he identified as an American "car engine" boater which was moving in a routine exercise flight at approx. 23,000 ft. The bomber's path of flight was south and slowly turning "back", called by four different variations.

Simultaneously he observed (still with naked eye) to the left (west) of the bomber an UFOB, the size of a good sized pea. He stated that with glasses, the boater appeared 1 inch, in size. The UFOB, clearly circular in shape, appeared as a round disk and was amber red in color. There was no vapor trail, as the UFOB approached the vicinity of the bomber at a very high speed.

In the first 3 seconds the UFOB suddenly stopped at an approximate altitude of 20,000 ft. and hovered almost directly overhead (and slightly to his N) for approx 2 minutes. In the next 3 seconds it veered sharply to the north (away from the bomber), in the glasses appeared a disk, and just as suddenly reversed its course towards the bomber. About a second later it flashed off in a flash toward and in an incredibly fast speed across the sky and disappeared in distance (west) about 3 inches above horizon.

Total time of observation: 3 minutes.

Enclosed Report of [redacted] is self-explanatory.
