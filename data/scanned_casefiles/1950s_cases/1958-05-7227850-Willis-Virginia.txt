Dear Sirs:

I am sending, under separate cover (w/ photo Continues) a few strips of foil that fell near my home around the 13-14th of May.

They apparently fell at night and I was wondering if you could tell me what they are. Could these pieces have come from weather instruments sent aloft or, from something else?

I have about one dozen more, but none are longer than the ones I am sending if you put have a "pinkish" color & others are rough on one side that appear & have been peeled off from another surface.

Thought perhaps - you would be interested in them.

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]
