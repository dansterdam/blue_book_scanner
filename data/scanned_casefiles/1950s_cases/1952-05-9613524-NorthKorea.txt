   Any unusual maneuvers: Moved horizontal for approximately 4 seconds until 90°
   from pilot's wing, it went into steep climb and then continued on and went into
   a shallow descent until lost in haze
   Formation if more than one: None
   Any other pertinent or other unusual features: The object appeared to leave its
   own source of light and was very bright
3. Manner of observation: Visual or electronic: Visual
   From air or surface: Air
   Course: 180° heading
   Altitude: 9000 Feet

   sight the object was made: None
   Any activity or conditions meteorological or other wise which might account for
   the sighting: None
4. Remarks: None   Pilot's statement enclosed

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:
Capt [REDACTED] at time of observation called it in as bogey to his flight but his
transmission was weak and was not heard by the others in the flight. It wasn't
until after they had landed and were discussing the object that either observer knew
that the other one had seen it. The two observations were made separately without
being called to their attention at the time seen.

STATEMENT
15 May 1952

Returning from target area May 15, 1952 I was flying number four position. At approximately 1835 hour I first sighted this object. Our altitude was 9000 feet. First sighted object at about one o'clock position from our flight. By the time I called the object in as a bogie, it had moved to the three o'clock position and started a steep climb, which I assumed was the beginning of a loop, but at the vertical position in the loop, the object moved forward in its original course of travel (360°) and wavered momentarily and then descended and disappeared into the haze which reached an altitude of approximately 7000-8000 feet.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: ATIL Offices, D/I FEAF         REPORT NO: IR-23-52         PAGE 13 of 16 PAGES

12. Extracted from FEAF "Intsum" #717, dtd 0320/2, 13 June 1952:

Enemy balloons: Recently several reports have been received concerning the sighting of an unidentified object in the air having a primary color of white changing to red, then to green, and located in the area of DT 204,598. These observations were made on 10 May and on 4, 6, and 7 June between the hours of 2100/I and 2100/T. In the majority of cases the object was described as being one shaped or round, at an altitude estimated between 1000 ft. and 10,000 feet, and in one case it was moved very rapidly horizontally for a distance. This movement was observed through a battery commander's scope and measured for 10 miles of travel, but the operation reported that he could not traverse fast enough to keep on target. This object was observed on 7 June for 1 hour and 5 minutes by a trained Air Technical Intelligence specialist and an ordnance Technical Intelligence specialist. At 0911h5/I June and saw a balloon being raised and lowered on a cable. D/I FEAF Comment: Most of the previous sightings of unidentified objects have occurred in the CT and DT grid areas. The high horizontal speed of the one sighting could be accounted for by a free balloon caught in a horizontal draft in the mountainous areas of that sector. The purpose of raising and lowering a balloon so near the front lines is not apparent, but could possibly be a method of communication.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Alt Ground Radar, Air Radar, Air Visual Combined Sightings

1. North Korea - 26 May 1952

An F-94 flying a mission was told by ground radar that there was an unidentified object on its tail. The interceptor aircraft turned into the unknown and looked on with its radar at 7000 yds, and started to close. Both the pilot and the R.O. observed a brilliant white light straight ahead. The unidentified performed a steady climbing turn and accelerated at a tremendous speed drawing away from the F-94 which now had cut in its after-burner. The pilot was unable to close and the R.O. lost the object at 2600 yds. at 15 second of contact.

The airborne radar was checked for malfunction before and after the mission and found to be in perfect condition. No exhaust patterns from the unknown were noticed. Pilot [redacted] Radar Operator - Lt [redacted] Experience - 1 year.

Solution: Possible malfunction of airborne radar set.

7. Extracted from Fifth Air Force "Perintrap" for 27 May 1952:

At 260520/I over CT 3930 at 7500 feet altitude, radar controller vectored an F-94 into 4 tail chase on an unidentified aircraft. Contact was made at 7000 yards. After closing to 6000 yards, the midnight/red pickup and speed and traveled from 6000 to 26000 yards in 11 seconds. The F-94 crew said they had afterburner in operation and were accelerating from 250 knots. D/I 5th AF Comments - The 600kts AISS is investigating the incident, and if further info is obtained it will be forwarded.

Comment - If true as reported, the final velocity of the object would be approximately 3000 mph. Further questions, to be used in interrogating the F-94 crew, were sent to Fifth Air Force. The results are to be forwarded via a Form 112.

5. Extracted from Fifth Air Force Mission Summary, 19 May 1952:

Unidentified objects: At 151100-I, 2 F-86 pilots observed a bright object traveling on a 90 degree heading at 10,000 feet at 30 382N. Length of observation was 10 seconds. Pilots observed intermittent flashes about 1 mile apart and estimated the speed of the object to be 1500 mph. Intelligence officer at the 51st Fighter Interceptor Group considers credibility of witnesses to be excellent. D/I Comment: Personnel of Detachment 1, 600th AIS interviewed pilots but no additional information could be obtained. Report being made in accordance with letter FEAF, AG 350.07, subject: Reporting Information on Unidentified Flying Objects, dated 5 March 1952.

a. Comment - The flashes of light with no definite reference points makes the estimation of speed seem questionable. There is no indication as to what might have caused the lights. Physiological limitations would greatly lower the credibility of estimation of size, distance and speed. It is believed that there have been a number of sightings similar to this one which have not been officially reported, because of lack of any further information other than the reported flash of light and no definite indication of distance, speed and altitude.

Weather and Wind Conditions at time of sighting: The weather was very good and
air to ground visibility was approximately 10 miles. Air to air visibility unlimited. Only a visual contact was made. Unable to contact with radar. There
did not appear to be any meteorological conditions or activities which might
account for the sighting.

B. The following information concerns the second unidentified flying object encountered immediately after the preceding one mentioned by the same crew and
aircraft on the same mission.

1. Date of sighting: 26 May 1952
   Time sighted: 0320I
   Length of sighting: About 14 seconds
   Area of sighting: CT3920
   Altitude: Approximately 7000 feet
   Weather: Very Clear

2. After making seven passes on the unidentified light the i/o (Brondic)
called and told the crew that there was an unknown on their tail. They were given
a vector whereupon they turned to the right and in a climb. On a North East
heading the unidentified was picked up by the radar observer and lock-on was
at 7000 yards and approximately 7500 foot altitude. The aircraft started to
close with the unidentified up to 6000 yards at which time the unidentified went
into a shallow climb and started to pull away at the unknown was approximately
25,000 yards away and the lock-on was broken. The time taken to go from 6000
yards to 26,000 yards was 14 seconds. The interceptor aircraft put their afterburner on one were accelerating from 250 knots at the time the unknown was drawing
away from them. No actual ascertainable visual observation was made. No exhaust
pattern was noted by the pilot.

3. The Director of Intelligence, Far East Air Forces forwarded a list of specific
questions to be asked of the crew for further information.

a. Was the airborne radar set malfunctioning: The set was working very good.
It is checked out before and after each mission. The type set is AFG-33.

b. Experience of crew: 1st Lt. [redacted], Pilot, has 25 scrambles and
missions in this theatre. 1st Lt. [redacted], Radar Observer has 23
scrambles and missions in this theatre. He has worked with this type radar
equipment for approximately one year. The crews normally work as a team and
if possible to out together on all missions and scrambles.

c. Did the operator take his eyes off the scope at any time? No. The operator states he watched the scope all the time until the lock-on was broken at
24,000 to 26,000 yards. The time from 6000 yards to approximately 24,000 to 26,000
yards increase in range took about 14 seconds. The time was measured by counting
verbally. After a period of experience the operators became quite proficient in
this system and are able to be off not more than two seconds either way in a period
of a minute.

d. Was pip centered or was it at edge of scope? The pip was centered and
about 10 degrees high at all times until lock-on was broken.

e. Did acceleration appear to be constant or did it appear to jump? Acceleration was constant and did not appear to jump. The unidentified went into a shallow climb.

with the F-94 following up to and passing 10,000 foot altitude until lock-on was
broken.

f. Size of Object: The radar set was on long range and therefore it was not
possible to determine the size of the object. It is possible to get sighting in
short range only up to 5000 yards when a comparative size can be obtained from the
pip. The object was never closer than 6000 yards and at long range the pip usually
remains the same in size except for a slight fading until the lock in broken.

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:
From the information obtained it would appear that the two objects might have
a relationship to each other, although no size or shape of either one could be
obtained. The point of interest is that the bright light was above our present
bomb line and the unidentified high speed object was to the rear of our front
lines.

V ANCENT A. GOOLEY
Captain, USAF
Investigating Officer

D/I REAR COMMENT:
1. The distance covered by the object is approximately 68,500 feet.
Acceleration is 650 ft/sec/sec, or approximately 20 "G" acceleration (which is
much more than the human body can stand for more than a fraction of a second).
The final velocity is found to be 9450 ft/sec, or approximately 5760 knots (6420 mph).

2. The radar sets are checked before and after every mission, and in this
case appeared to be working normally. Even if the were assumed that the operator's
timing, or the AFG-33 calibration were off as much as 50%, the speed is still above
any known type of missile.

3. No information has yet been received from the ground controller at
Broside as to the return plotted or the length of time that object was held in
contact by the ground radar.

The phenomenal acceleration reported leads to the belief that the AFG-33 was
not operating correctly at the time of contact, despite checks before and after
the mission.

STATEMENT
29 May 1952

On the morning of the 26th May, 1952, I certify as to the following:

While on CAP-sortie from K-13 Bromide informed me of an unknown located at GR 4856 and told us to investigate. After descending to 2500 feet we saw, in the glare of the front line searchlights, a small plane beneath, but were unable to descend further due to terrain to determine type. Provide told us to drop it and take up a Southerly heading. When we turned to this heading, we saw a brilliant object above and in front of us and ahead. With his permission we made our first pass from North to South within 600 feet, then a succession of passes from cardinal compass points ranging to within 50 feet, but, because of the brilliancy of the light, we could discern no outline. On our last pass my Radar Observer looked back and said he thought he saw an object on our tail. I did not give much credence to his observation until Brgade called and told me he had picked up an object on his radar. I then requested Bromide to vector me for an interception on this new unidentified. (At this time the Brilliant object was still in sight). When I received my first vector, I was south of the brilliant object and started a starboard turn to the Jitney strip for the new unidentified. On a Northeasterly heading my 2/0 gave me a lookout, overhead 50 yards, range 7000 yards, nearly dead ahead and slightly above. When I closed to 6000 yards, the object started to pull away and in a throw the afternoon was in (airspeed at this time was 250 knots). In a gradual climb and still with the object nearly centered on the scope, the range increased at a steady rate from 6000 yards to approximately 26000 yards in 12-15 seconds. At that range we broke lock. To observe action was observed and no exhaust patterns such as might be expected.

STATEMENT
29 May 1952

We had dropped down to about 3,000 feet to investigate an unknown that CGI was painting, and after making a few circles over this unknown, Martin, my pilot, spotted this bright light. We got permission to investigate the light by GOT. I tried to pick the light up with my radar.

Unit I GOT, 7,000 yds. We were then painting this light at about seven (7) passes at the light after the third pass I came out of the box 6 miles a look. I was convinced the light was not understandable how CGI was painting this target and I could not pick it up.

I flew about 7,000 feet and then after the last pass that someone was on our tail. I turned and thought I saw a plane, but could not be sure, an instant only for a second. I started a right turn and to climb. I then picked our target at about 7,000 yds and about 7,000 feet altitude and looked on. I believe that this was the target CGI was painting all the time, and that he was in our area while we were making passes at the light. He started to over take our target and moved in from 7,000 yds to 6,000 yds. He was in the center of my scope, and about 5 or 10 degrees high. We were climbing all the time. He then went from 6,000 yds to about 24,000 yds in about 14 seconds and we broke lock. We did not pick him up the rest of our mission.

6. Extracted from Fifth Air Force "Parintrop", 19 May 1952:

Balloon sightings: At 16/210-I, vicinity of CT 4035, an F-94 crew observed a balloon approximately 3 feet in/diameter. Observation was made by means of a small light suspended from the balloon. The balloon was first observed at 13000 feet and the F-94 followed to 21000 feet. Estimated rate of climb of balloon was 2000 ft/min, as the F-94 had to use afterburner in the chase. The balloon was shot down over CT 1016, At 16095-3, vicinity CT 2828, an F-94 crew again observed a balloon, this time at 12000 feet. Again by means of a steady burning light suspended from the 3 to 6 feet diameter balloon. Preliminary pursuit shooting was started, shooting it down at CT 1010. The white light, described as "Very powerful", was still burning as the balloon fell. D/I Comment (5th AF) - Further investigation is being made by the Cold, ATSS.

Comment - This report of lighted balloons may be a basis of explanation for many of the sightings reported over this area of Korea.

At 260325/1 over CT 5050 at 7000 feet altitude, an F-24 observed an unidentified aircraft with a very strong light which was visible from at least 5 miles. The F-94, crew stated that it was definitely not a balloon as several passes were made directly beneath at 50 ft range. No outline was visible because of the brilliant light.

a. Comment - There have been a number of balloon sightings over this area. Reports have also been received of enemy aircraft carrying searchlights over the Northwest target areas of Korea, though none have been reported in the CT area.

Ground Radar, Air Radar, Air Visual Combined Sightings

1. North Korea - 26 May 1952

An F-94 flying a mission was told by ground radar that there was an unidentified object on its tail. The interceptor aircraft turned into the unknown and looked on with its radar at 7000 yds, and started to close. Both the pilot and the R.O. observed a brilliant white light straight ahead. The unidentified performed a steady climbing

turn and accelerated at a tremendous speed drawing away from the F-94 which now had cut in its after-burner. The pilot was unable to close and the R.O. lost the object at 2600 yds. after 15 seconds of contact.

The airborne radar was checked for malfunction before and after the mission and found to be in perfect condition. No exhaust patterns from the unknown were noticed. Pilot - Lt R. noted. Experience - 1 year. Radar Operator - Lt R.

Solution: Possible malfunction of airborne radar set.

I was flying wing on a fighter sweep of North Korea this date when I called him a bogie at 9 o'clock position, object flashed in the sun. I quickly called him to roll up in a right turn as object was going under us from the left to right, when I saw object again it was almost out of sight and seemed to be rolling with puffs of white (2 or 3) behind it.

6. Extracted from Fifth Air Force "Marintrep", 19 May 1952:

Balloon sightings: At 16D210-1, vicinity of CT 1035, an F-94 crew observed a balloon approximately 3 feet in diameter. Observation was made by means of a small light suspended from the balloon. The balloon was first observed at 13000 feet and the F-94 followed to 21000 feet. Estimated rate of climb of balloon was 2000 ft/min, as the F-94 had to use afterburner in the chase. The balloon was shot down over CP 1046, At 16D352-1, vicinity of CP 828, an F-94 crew again observed a balloon, this time at 12000 feet. Again by means of a steady burning, light suspended from balloon, shooting to 6 feet diameter balloon. Friendly pursued the balloon using afterburner, shooting it down at CT 14010. The white light, described as "Very powerful," was still burning as the balloon fell. D/T Comment (5th AF) - Further investigation is being made by the 60th ATSS.

a. Comment: This report of lighted balloons may be a basis of explanation for many of the sightings reported over this area of Korea.

12. Extracted from FEAF "Intsun" #717, dtd 0520%, 13 June 1952:

Enemy balloons: Recently several reports have been received concerning the sighting of an unidentified object in the air having a primary color of white changing to red, than to gray, and located in the area of DT 20/295. These observations were made on 10 May and on 6, and 7 June between the hours of 2102/I and 2100/I. In the majority of cases the object was described as being egg shaped or round, at an altitude between 1000 ft and 10,000 feet. In one case it was reported to have moved very rapidly horizontal for a distance. This movement was observed through a battery commander's scope and measured for 10 miles of travel, but the observer reported that he could not traverse fast enough to keep on target. This object was observed on 7 June for 1 hour and 5 minutes by a trained Air Technical Intelligence specialist and an ordnance Technical Intelligence specialist. As a result of these observations, I forward observer investigated the area at 0911hrs/7 June and saw a balloon being raised and lowered on a cable. D/T FEAF Comments: Most of the previous sightings of unidentified objects have occurred in the CT and DT grid areas. The high horizontal speed of the one sighted balloon could be accounted for by a free balloon caught in a horizontal draft in the mountainous areas of that sector. The purpose of raising and lowering a balloon so near the front lines is not apparent, but could possibly be a method of communication.
