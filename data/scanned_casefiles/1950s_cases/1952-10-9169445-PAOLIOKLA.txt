1. SYNOPSIS:  At Fort Worth, Texas, of unknown reliability, voluntarily reported
using an object in the city while enroute via automobile to Fort
Worth, Texas, at a point 13.8 miles northwest of Jacksboro, Texas,
on US Highway 281, at 1811 hours, CST, 29 October 1952. Object
appeared from the northwest, flying a straight course of approx-
imately 245 to 250 degrees, an an estimated speed of 750 to 800
miles an hour, at an altitude of approximately 1500 to 2000 feet.
NO-PIBAL WAS first attracted to the object by an exhaust flash,
bright orange color, lasting approximately one (1) second, followed
by two (2) other exhaust flashes lasting approximately the same
length of time. The second exhaust flash illuminated the object,
for approximately one (1) second, and was estimated to be 1/3th of
a mile directly in the path of his car. Described two
object as being similar to a disc, circular in shape, or two (2)
table plates laid inverted, one upon the other, approximately
forty (40) to fifty (50) feet in diameter and five (5) or six (6)
feet thick at its center, tapering from the center to a thin-like
leading edge. The object appeared to be gray, or dull aluminum,
in color with black trimmed leading edges. The exhaust left no
smoke trail and disappeared into the twilight, continuing in its
course. No visible identifying markings were observed on the
object, and the weather was clear. The time of day was at dusk,
and headlights of his automobile were not on. At the time, no
traffic, in either direction, was observed, and no activity near
that would cause a reflection in the sky. No visible evidence of
aircraft flight, and object flow swiftly, with no seeming
resistance from the elements. The object made no sound audible
above the sound of automobile.

STATEMENT OF WITNESS

[Top of document header partially legible]

[Most of the text is difficult to read due to poor image quality and dark background. Some words and phrases are partially discernible, but a complete and accurate transcription is not possible without risking introducing errors. The document appears to be a sworn statement or witness testimony, with some text visible but largely obscured.]

The document is a typewritten page with a "STATEMENT OF WITNESS" header, with some white circular marks/holes at the top of the page. The text is very dark and blurry, making most of the content illegible.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

I further state that I have read this officer statement, typewritten on this and the preceding page, and the same is true to the best of my knowledge.

[Bottom of document contains form fields, but most text is too faint or blurry to read clearly]


- page 8 -

The text in this image is mostly illegible. There are some faint vertical text lines on the right side of the image, but they are too blurry and low-contrast to be accurately transcribed. The image appears to be a black and white photograph with some white circular objects at the top of the image and a long vertical object in the center, but the details are difficult to discern due to the poor image quality.

Following report of unidentified object was given by an air crew aboard a C-47 type aircraft consisting of USAF Captain JACK E. McKINLEY, Captain JOHN R. NAU and S/Sgt George W. Watson, on a return routine flight from Enid, Oklahoma to Perrin Air Force Base, Texas, home station. All three crew members are considered reliable. See Fact II.

(1) The one object sighted was round, bright-bluish in color; it traveled in a straight line from east to west at jet speed, estimated by one of the source, S/Sgt George M. Watson, to be 600 miles per hour; however, the two official "would not estimate a definite speed." One simply stated "jet speed." There was no distinguishable exhaust but one side of the object was a brighter blue; however, that side was consistently bright.  The object burst into fragments and simultaneously disappeared.

(2) Object was sighted at 1813 hours, Central Standard Time, 29 October 1952.  Length of time observed was about ten seconds.

(3) Observation was made visually from a G-47 type aircraft, altitude 5500 feet, speed 150 miles per hour.

(4) Location of observers was 33° 37'N, 87° 15'W over the Canadian river, south of Oklahoma City in Oklahoma.  Object was at 5500 feet altitude and traveling east to west in a straight line.  None of the crew would estimate the distance of the object from the G-47 aircraft.

(5) All three observers have not previously experienced the sighting of an unidentified object and as described above.  The two officers have responsible positions in a flying training group, Perrin Air Force Pass, Texas and all three of the observers are considered reliable.

(6) Weather at the time and place of sighting was fair, visibility was fifteen miles with wind from the North, North West at eight knots.

(7) There was no known condition, meteorological or otherwise which would have accounted for the sighting.

(8) There is no known existence of evidence such as fragments, photographs, etc. of the sighting.

(9) At the time of sighting, above crew notified Oklahoma City radio station, Oklahoma of the incident and also reported to base operations, Perrin Air Force Base, Texas, upon landing.  This base then notified Carswell Air Force Base, Texas flight center which did not later report an intercepts.  The sighting crew of the G-47 aircraft also notified Perrin Air Force Base which further reported the sighting as provided for in Air Force Letter 200-5, dated 29 April 1952.

(10) No air traffic was observed in the area at the time of the sighting.

SKETCH

On the night of Tuesday, 28 October 1952, I was pilot of Air Force C-47 No. 9236 returning from Yakota, AFB, Okinawa to Tachikawa, AFB, Japan. The aircraft was on a direct course at 5500 feet, maintaining a compass heading of 150°. Take off time from Yakota was 1750 hours, control approximately 1213 hours. On an unspecified job just traveling at best of my knowledge, I reported the following observations to be true and correct.

Date 28 October 1952, time of observation 1213 hours Central: Place near Fuels Vallay, Okinawa (see attached chart). Color of object, bright white shape of object not determined (no tail) flight path of object level flight from East to West. Speed of object unknown. Estimated to be jet aircraft speed or faster. Altitude of object, 5500 feet. Duration of observation estimated 5 to 8 seconds. Characteristics of object: Appeared in level flight and seemed to explode into numerous bright fragments. The ground area in the vicinity where object seemed to disintegrate and disappear showed no evidence of the objected striking the earth.

SKETCH: View from Interior of C-47 Aircraft

I, S/Sgt George W. Watson to the best of my knowledge state these facts that follow to be true.

At about 1815 hours, on the evening of 28 October 1952, I was flying in a C-47 (9336) type aircraft with Capt. R. JACK E. McKINTOSH and Capt. JOHN R. NAUG NAU and myself were watching for aircraft in the area as a safety measure when out of the East came this bright lite 11:14 and passed to the West. I'd disappeared, I couldn't hear a sound for our engines were making noise. The speed seemed to be that of a jet aircraft. We were up about 5500 feet altitude. This happened over Oklahoma.
