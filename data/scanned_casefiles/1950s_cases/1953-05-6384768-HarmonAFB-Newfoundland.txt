AF FORM 112-PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

1. An unidentified flying object was observed visually for the mount at Ernest Harmon AFB (43/33N, 5/33W) near/around at 0700-0752.

2. Mr. [redacted], Canadian National civilian, in conversation with Mr. Finney, was seated or the steps of the Canadian Post Office Building, Ernest Harmon AFB, when the flying object was observed. Mr. [redacted] attention was attracted by a color, which he describes as a bright light traveling west of a rotating collector blade. Looking up, he saw a bright object traveling west at a low altitude. The object traveled in a arc, then seemed to go through the base of light from a rotating beacon as near to [illegible] the side only. This is light. After taking through [illegible] the base of light, the object again seemed to appear as a shadow.

3. [Redacted] estimated the object was four (4) or five (5) feet long, about two (2) feet wide, and traveled at a considerable speed. Part of the passage out of the light the building near two (2) or three (3) seconds observed. At a point first observed, it then traveled to the southeast until the corner of the post office was reached, then stopped.

4. No lights, tails or trails were visible. No noise was heard other than the sound of the aircraft engines. Visibility was 1000 feet, smoke, 15 miles visibility. Low ceiling, checking the hills to the north.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. A check of aircraft flight plans and weather balloons indicates that neither could account for the sighting.

2. From the information of the observer, it is calculated that the object would be traveling from 140 to 250 miles per hour.

3. Although the estimated speed would be comparable to that of a small aircraft, the negative flight plan checks necessitate final evaluation as that of a flying object.
