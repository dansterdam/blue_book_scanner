2. [Redacted] was interviewed by a representative of this office,
at 1500 hours on 23 September 1952. [Redacted] stated at approximately 2315 hours,
on 23 September 1952, he [redacted] had just completed an
Air Police tour of town patrol in Warner Robins, Georgia, and returned to the
Main Gate on the Base. Sgt. [redacted] of the Civilian Guard Force told
them that he had seen a number of lights in the sky off to the west and wanted
them to go down near the 5th Street Gate with his where they could be seen
clearly.

3. The observer proceeded to a point approximately one hundred (100)
yards to the south of 5th Street Gate. [Redacted] then looked due
west and saw five (5) or six (6) white lights above a grove of trees
at an angle of approximately five (5) degrees from eyesight. He judged the
objects were about five (5) miles away, and perfectly round in shape.

4. Observer stated that the lights were very similar to that of stars,
but just a little brighter. Units appeared to be circling and never gained
or lost altitude, moving the five (5) miles without observable change. Objects moved at
uniform speed and were in the same location at the end of observation.

5. [Redacted] stated that during his observation, a plane took off from the
field in a Southwest direction and passed between the objects and his point
of observation. He could not estimate the distance between the plane and objects.

6. Observer detected no sound, vibration, smoke, flame or odor. Attached
is a drawing made by [redacted] in an attempt to present in pictorial form the outline
and relative position of the objects.

7. Has not under the influence of intoxicants at the time of observation.

8. He has taken no particular interest in the subject of flying saucers and
has read only what appeared in the newspapers about them.

   Bounds stated that he then looked to the west and saw five (5) or six (6)
   round lights that were now close at an angle of approximately ten (10)
   degrees from eyesight. The lights were yellow-white in color and looked very
   small like stars. The lights appeared to be some four (4) or five (5) miles away,
   and were moving in a circle. The width at no time ranged more than a tenth of a
   degree. He saw location until the end of observation, which lasted approximately
   five (5) minutes. The observer then proceeded to Flight Operations and reported
   the incident. The objects were not seen from Operations.

6. Bounds detected no sound, vibration, smoke, flame or odor. Attached is
   reply to query by Bounds in an attempt to assess his potential reaction to
   position of the objects.

7. Bounds stated that during his observation, a plane took off from the
   field in a southwest direction and passed between the objects and his point of
   observation. He could not estimate the distance between the plane and objects.
