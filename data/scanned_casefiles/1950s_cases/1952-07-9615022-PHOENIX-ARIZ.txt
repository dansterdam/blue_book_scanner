IR-5-52

127th Pilot Training Wing
Luke A.F.B., Phoenix, Arizona                UNCLASSIFIED                2     3

Lt. Duane K. Miller, AO 776673, Assistant Base Operations Officer, was contacted by telephone by Mrs. [redacted], Phoenix, Arizona (phone) on 2 July 1952 after spotting an unidentified flying object. Previous efforts to contact subject were unsuccessful.

A follow-up investigation by this office produced the following information:

1. Sighted object was "ball of fire" shaped like a "flattened out grapefruit". With 1 painter cutting across its diameter. Sighted object was 7 to 8 inches in diameter with a naked eye. Color was "like the yellow flame of a candle". A trail of flame extended six to eight feet stern. Trail was broad as the object itself at the base, remaining narrow and thinning down. Speed seemed "a little faster than searchlights (reflected) on clouds". Object flew in shallow arc and disappeared when a house obstructed vision.

2. Object was sighted at about 0420 hours on 2 July 1952 for 3 to 4 minutes including observation of burning trail after object had disappeared.

3. Observation was made visually from the ground walk of residence at [redacted] Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona. Object was observed in flight through 90° of compass, appearing first northwest and disappearing southwest. Various angles of elevation from the horizon are as follows:
Northwest - 40°
North - 30°
Northeast - 10 to 15°

Distance of object estimated at 7 to 10 miles.

5. Subject volunteered information that she is far-sighted, has lived near many air bases, frequently scans the skies she likes to know what is passing overhead. Subject subsequently, sometime later, USA, Chandler, said she planned a trip with his wife. She had set her "mental alarm clock" to get up early. She went outside for air because she had had trouble sleeping.

6. Weather conditions at the time of the sighting were reported as follows:
Hour    Ceiling    Visibility    Wind
0330    Clear    15 + miles    4 knots north
0520    Clear    15 + miles    2 knots north
0530    25000 feet    60 miles    calm
        very light
        scattered
        overcast

7. No meteorological phenomena reported.

8. None

9. A search of areas indicated on enclosed overlay has been requested of base Operations. Premise from angle of flight that object contacted ground. Object of search is areas or burn marks on ground. No observations reported yet.

10. No military or commercial air traffic was in vicinity at time of sighting.
