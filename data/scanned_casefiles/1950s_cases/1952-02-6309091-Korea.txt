On 012110-I Jan 52 at BS6070 an RB-26 observed a bright orange glow traveling at least 600 mph on a 120 degree heading at 7000 ft.  The glow appeared to be coming from an object smaller than that of a jet aircraft exhaust.  The glow did not diminish but went out suddenly.  The navigator stated that the glow bore great similarity to a World War II V-1 rocket.
