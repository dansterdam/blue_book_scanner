a. Object Data
    (1) Shape: Shallow, bell-shaped. (See attachment #1).

    (2) Size: The size of this object could not be accurately judged because
    it was at an unknown distance from the observer's position. The observer stated
    that the object appeared to be roughly triangular in shape. At area length the
    object was approximately 5 to 6 inches across the base of the triangle and
    about 4 to 5 inches from apex to base. The object appeared to drift slowly
    about 3 to 10 times longer than the object itself. She did state that this
    trail could have been similar to the after-glow of a cigarette moved quickly
    through the air in a darkened room without than an actual smutted trail.

    (3) Color: The object appeared to be very bright and
    colorless. She stated that the "trail" was whiter in color though duller in
    intensity than the object itself but under continued questioning could give no
    color impression of the object. The observer stated that the trail appeared
    to be non-solid and extended. She did not notice the light reflected in objects
    within her range of vision nor did she notice reflected light in her darkened
    room.

    (4) Number: One
    (5) Formation: N/A
    (6) Features: No apparent flight control surfaces.
    (7) Trail: (See (3) above.
    (8) Sounds: None
    (9) Other features: None.

b. Description of Course:
    (1) What first called observers attention to object:
    Her first call had risen approximately 10 0915Z March 1959 to give
    her sick child some medicine. At 0925Z after having again retired, she was lying
    in bed observing the stars through her bedroom window with faces south, when the
    object appeared at the left or eastern edge of her bedroom window.

    (2) Angle or elevation and azimuth when first seen:
    Was stated that when first seen the object was about 15° above the
    horizon. From her position, its distance from the windows and her description she
    first observed the object 170 to 175° azimuth.

    (3) Angle of elevation and azimuth when last seen:
    When last seen the object was between 20° and 25° above the horizon and
    at 220° - 225° azimuth from observers position.

    (4) Flight Path:
    The object was observed south of 34° 34' 30"N/117° 22' 15" W at an
    unknown distance traveling in a straight line shallow ascent from east to west.
    The observer stated that the objects line of flight could have been East Southeast
    to West Northwest.

k. Position, title, and comments of preparing officer:
(1) Rudolph H. Pestalozzi, Captain, USAF, 831st Air Division Intelligence Officer

(2) Comments:
    (a) Mrs. [redacted] had heard of Unidentified Flying Objects and knew vaguely that the Air Force was interested in these reports.

    (b) She had never before seen anything like this object. She was absolutely certain that this object was not an aircraft and just as certain that it was not a meteorite. The object's speed was too fast and silent to be an airplane and too slow to be that of a meteorite.

    (c) Mrs. [redacted] appeared to be sincere in her effort to report factually and was convinced that what she saw does exist.

    (d) She denied wearing glasses and stated that upon last examination her eyes were normal.

    (e) 1 There were no other reports of UFOs at or near the time of observation.

2 Personnel in the George AFB Air Traffic Control Tower, 2½ miles north of observers position, saw nothing unusual that night and had no air traffic in their system for about two hours before or three hours after the sighting time.

3 The tower personnel reported no astronomical or meteorological phenomena that could account for this sighting.

    (f) Mrs. [redacted] appeared to be a lucid, honest person. She firmly believes and saw what she reported and reported what she saw.

    (g) There is no evidence, pro or con, other than Mrs. [redacted]'s word to substantiate this report.

1. Existence of physical evidence: none.
