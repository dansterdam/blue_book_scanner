AF FORM 112 - PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
27th FIGHTER ESCORT WING
SUBJECT: Unidentified Object or Lights
On 13 Feb 52, at about 2300 hrs, the pilot of a 27th Fighter Escort Wing aircraft was flying a night operational mission south along the coast of Honshu, Japan, when an unidentified object or lights were observed. The pilot was flying at an altitude of about 15,000 feet, the weather was clear, and visibility was excellent. The pilot observed the object or lights for approximately 2 minutes. The lights appeared as a steady white light, quite large, and moving in a straight and level course, estimated speed being approximately 1000 knots.
 The lights were on a reciprocal heading to the pilot, passing down the right side of his aircraft at a distance of approximately 2-3 miles. The pilot could not discern any definite shape or outline of the object, the lights giving the appearance of an elongated shape or row of lights. After passing the pilot's aircraft, the object or lights continued on a straight and level course to the northeast.
METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS: The weather was clear, visibility was excellent, and there were no meteorological conditions which could account for the sighting.
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE: None.
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None.
INTERPRETATION UNDERTAK EN: The sighting could not be identified or explained. The distance, speed, and other characteristics of the object or lights do not coincide with any known aircraft in this area. Source is stable and thoroughly reliable.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

276th FIGHTER-BOMBER WING

SUBJECT: UFO: Fighter pilot sighting of a bright light chasing a star. 
WHEN: 27 Feb 53, 1930L 
WHERE: Over Honshu, Japan
OBSERVER: Pilot, 276th Fighter-Bomber Wing

NARRATIVE: The pilot of a F-84 jet fighter observed a bright light chasing a star-like object during night flight over Honshu, Japan. The pilot first noticed the light at 1930L hours. It was a very bright light, brighter than the star it was chasing, and appeared to be on a converging course with the star. The light gained on the star, pulled alongside it, and then accelerated sharply away. The whole event lasted approximately 30 seconds.

The pilot states that the light appeared to be a solid object, not merely a point source of light. It had no trail or exhaust, and no noise was detected. The pilot continued his mission and did not attempt to pursue or investigate further.

OPINIONS: Pilot is considered reliable and his story is consistent with other UFO reports received. The lack of any exhaust or sound suggests the object was not an aircraft. Possibility of meteor or other natural celestial phenomena cannot be ruled out, however, the maneuvering capabilities described are not typical of such objects. The incident remains unidentified.

CONCLUSION: This incident is being forwarded to higher headquarters for further analysis and evaluation. More data is needed to determine the nature of the observed phenomenon.

EMERSON MCMILLIN OBSERVATORY

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
VRIGE-Matereson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

As you know, as soon as our plans for employing Miss Gluck officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each file. The letter method is obvious drawbacks. But until that time comes and she can handle my typing and cognition of forms, I find below such to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only 5 really interesting cases. I might mention a 5th, 28 March 52, report is DESP, 1st report I've seen of an honest-to-goodness mirage. 6 Cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of disregarding these. 

8 April was a meteor case (great ball of fire, as reported) the Venus if reported time, was in error.

28 March Albrook AFB was probably Venus.
21 March Greene(land) and 19 March Lockport, are puzzling but could possibly have been balloons.
The 13-16 March Gracenland case was an obvious meteor.
The 9 March San Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no explanation. Anything more come in on this one? Don't think this is good enough for a punch-boule but a lot of investigation might reveal something significant.

To believe the duration times needs gooking here. Hard to find land and sea objects could have a duration as long as 17 seconds. This is a possibility to investigating cause.

Next is the 12 April Speed AFB. I think this is the most interesting case of the batch and I hope you receive some data on it. Questionative should be sent. I'd like to see Wenzl explain this one. Is there any possibility that these could have been airplanes? Apparently ducks have been sighted. What do you think, could this have been a helicopter? We ought to see have much more information on this one. Has this been received?

Sincerely,
Allen Hynek

R/I Japan Air Defense Force Comments:

Reference earlier reports: 12-4-52, IR-5-52, IR-3-53 all dated 33 December 1952 (Colonel Blanchard, 47th Fighter Escort Wing), attached. The above report revisions contain virtually identical conditions observed, reporting, evaluating, photographing, object sighting, attitudes and/or alighting aircraft, descriptions of object sighted and weather conditions of object in each case.

20th Weather Squadron (this headquarters) prepared a weather study on it, applying standard procedures. This information has been referred under separate cover. It has been suggested that no unusual atmospheric conditions existed at time of sighting.

Atmospheric phenomena, as indicated in Major Williams' statement, has been subjected to further study. But the phenomena has been unable to develop any definitive conclusions of factors which may have contributed to this condition.

STATEMENT

1 April 1953

I was scheduled to fly the night of 31 March 1953, in an F-94 aircraft. I took off from Kisarazu, Tokyo, and near Tateyama, Choshi, I sighted and turned toward an object. The object was very large and brilliant and seemed to be approaching me. The object was at my six o'clock position at a range of approximately 10-12 miles and seemed to be flying at an altitude of 18,000 to 20,000 feet. The object appeared to be metallic and the light was very bright and seemed to be pulsating. I closed to within about 2 miles of the object at which time it suddenly accelerated and climbed out of sight, traveling at an estimated speed of 1200-1500 mph. After the object had climbed to an altitude above the horizon, bearing 330 degrees magnetic, it seemed to disappear and reappear several times. The horizon was very bright and no other stars were discernible until about 20 degrees above the horizon. I am convinced that what I saw was not a star or any other known aircraft. The object was definitely not reflecting sunlight, as it was observed at night. I must admit that I am puzzled as to the identity of the object. There were no other lights or objects observed, and I have no explanation for what I saw.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: JAPAN
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
DATE OF INFORMATION: 28 December 1952 - 29 December 1952
REPORT NO.: F-3
EVALUATOR: Captain Donald J. Curtin, Air Force 1-15 G-2
SUMMARY: The source whose information comprises this report, experien- ced two encounters with an unidentified flying object. The source provided the Air Force with some unusual technical data regarding the object, and information about its reported maneuvering characteristics.
A: DETAILS:
1. The source whose information comprises this report, experienced two encounters with an unidentified flying object. These encounters are described as follows:
a. On 28 December 1952, at approximately 2330 (Japan time), while flying a routine operational night mission, the source sighted an unidentified object at an estimated altitude of 12,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 5-7 minutes. It appeared to be spherical in shape, emitting a bright orange-red glow which illuminated the surrounding area. The object seemed to be stationary and was observed by several pilots. The object suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed, making an abrupt 90 degree turn and disappearing from view.
b. On 29 December 1952, at approximately 0100 (Japan time), while flying a similar night mission, the source again sighted an unidentified object at an estimated altitude of 8,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes. It appeared to be spherical in shape, emitting a bright orange-red glow. The object made erratic movements, rapidly changing direction and speed. It suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view.
2. The source was unable to obtain any photographs of the objects due to the poor visibility conditions existing at the time of the sightings.
