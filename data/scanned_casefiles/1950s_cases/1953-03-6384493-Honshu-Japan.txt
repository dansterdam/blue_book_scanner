AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

27th Fighter Escort Wing                                                 PAGE 3 OF 5 PAGES

of initial sighting was 40 deg. 57' 15" North Lat. - 141 deg. 23' 15" 
East Long. He was flying a mag heading of 010 degrees at altitude 
of 27,000 ft. At this sighting the object was higher than the observer 
at 9 o'clock to himself, almost due west from higher than the observer on a 
partial course due north. He lost sight of the object at approximately 
41 deg. 32' N - 140 deg. 30' E. Some 7 minutes after sighting it, the 
source sought sight of the object for the second time just five minutes 
after losing sight of it. This was at 2000 hrs (8:00 PM), and the source 
was still at 35,000 ft altitude, but heading 8/8 on mag heading of 160 
degrees. During this second sighting, the object was still at the 
same altitude level as the F-84 pilot, but it appeared approximately 
30 degrees to the right of the F-84s nose - distance still unknown, 
the general area of these sightings was the extreme northern portion of 
the island of Honshu, Japan.

5. IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:- The pilot reporting these sightings 
is a Colonel possessing long experience in World War II and the Korean 
theater. Source has hold responsible command assignments for some time, 
and personally commends a fighter escort Wing operations under the Japan 
Air Defense Force. The accuracy of source's statements was consistent 
and thoroughly interrogation, his sagacity of times, locations and 
descriptions did not vary at any time. Source is stable and thoroughly 
reliable.

6. "NATURE AND WINDS ALOFT CONDITIONS:- The area in which the 
sightings were made had the following weather conditions at 1730 hrs 
(5:30 PM): 10/10s undercast, from 6,000 to 10,000 ft brilliant moonlight 
and visibility of minimum 40 miles; temperature at 35,000 ft was -56 
degrees, pressure 210 millibars. Winds aloft recorded by Misawa Weather 
Station were at 27,000 ft, 280 degrees, at 90 knots; at 35,000 ft from 
35,000 ft from 280 degrees, at 70 knots, and at 38,000 ft from 280 de-
grees, at 200 knots.

7. METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS FOR EXPLANATION:- There were no 
activities of a "met" nature, or any condition which could account for 
these sightings.

8. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF SIGHTING:- Those sightings stand on the 
strength of the native factors as surround by the source. There 
is no physical evidence of the object due to its disappearance on both 
occasions.

9. INTERROGATION UNDERTAKEN:- The source, upon sighting this 
object, called local GCI station on radio telephone, (VHF) and reported 
who he was observing. GCI introduced this pilot to interrogate offi-
cially object which he proceeded to attempt to accomplish. Since ini-
tially he was at 27,000 ft altitude, he climbed to 35,000 ft and 
levels after "non his saw was with the object. During this 
climb he was heading in a northwesterly direction. For approximately 
3 of the 7 minutes of observation, this source was riding a short 
of the lack of his F-84 (.82), as he set up a gradual curve to the 
west to hit upon a pursuit curve which would close the gap between him-
self and the object he noted that the object obviously was increasing 
in size. This closing of the distance continued for about one minute, 
than the object seemed to increase its "going away" speed and vanished 
in 30 seconds. At the time of the close approach, the source had 
managed to close to a point whereby the object was at eleven o'clock

to him. Just short of a true stern chase, During the time the pilot
was climbing and undertaking a curve toward the object, he exhibited
good presence of mind by extinguishing all the lights on his aircraft,
i.e., wing tip lights, fuselage lights as well as fluorescent lights
within the cockpit. Sources admit he readily decided on this course
of action to make certain that he was not getting some reflection from
his canopy surface. When all lights were out, he noted no change in
the appearance of brilliance of the object and its color scheme.

In the time of 10 to 15 seconds while on this heading, he noted an in-
crease in speed, both source and the object were headed due west. Source then
took up a new heading of 160 degrees and flew in a south-easterly direc-
tion. After five minutes of flight while on this heading, he noted
the object again at 35,000 ft level with him and flying what appeared
to be a parallel course to himself. It was at approximately 36 degrees
to the right of his aircraft's nose. This time the pilot was flying a
more than four minutes of observation, (all his navigation lights
were on again) the source again tried to set up an interception course
by swinging to the right. At this time the object pulled away for the
last time and disappeared in about five seconds time. It is revealed at
this time, that the only tangible point of coincidence noticeable was
the short period of time the object remained at a point of coincidence
time when the F-84 set up an interception course with the second
burning - just five seconds. In the first instance, with lights ex-
tinguished, he did manage to close considerably, but knowing the
true size of the object, he had no way of knowing just how much of the
gap had been successfully closed before the object increased speed,
appreciably and disappeared in 30 second. Source then returned to
the area of his base strand, Misawa Air Base and concluded his flight.

10. AIR TRAFFIC IN THE AREA:- The pilot of this F-84 was origi-
nally put on his guard to be watchful of something unusual, by virtue
of radar transmission of a track on a T/R call sign "Gander" on a
radar station on the ground. The T/R call sign used by this aircraft
was "Gander". Later check revealed that "Gander" cell gives utilized by an F-94 All Weather unit in this area. At that time the F-94,
was reporting his position as being approximately 35 miles south-east
of Chitose Air Base, (Hokkaido Island, Japan) the 0700 contacts of
his transmission are not recalled, but he did report sighting a "rotating" object. All lights, this transmission was heard at 1945 hre.
The pilot of the F-94, saw the object for the first time some
three minutes later. Local intelligence agencies were checking this
particulars of the F-94's sightings and it is assumed their findings
will be forwarded shortly. Uneveluated reports from neighboring intelligence agencies added the fact that this "rotating cluster" or
lights had been seen earlier in the evening by a B-26 aircraft flying
in the general area of Misawa Air Base. In addition, similar reports
were heard from personnel on duty in the Chitose Air Base Control
Tower the same evening.

source's experience and past actions demand attention to this sequence
of sightings. This pilot is thoroughly versed in the limitations of
flying machines; his attempt to garner all the pertinent information
concerning this unknown phenomenon was definitely genuine. His ability to
reconstruct all the factors common to these sightings was excellent
and well organized. The frequency of related sightings of an unrelated nature further attest to some unconventional flying object active
in this general area during the early evening hours of 29 December
1952.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:

1. The source showed great presence of mind in the investigation
of this unidentified object. There was a difference of 25 seconds in
the time it took the object to pull away when the source made his
two passes at the object, lights "out" and lights "on". Significantly
the longer time was taken on the first pass, the lights, out suggesting
closer proximity prior to observation by the object, assumed to exist. The fact that there was a full moon, excellent visibility, a
clear night, and an undercast furnish several excellent incidents
for distortion and reflections or refractions in the cockpit. It is
a fact that different types of aircraft canopies produce different
refractions or reflections of the same object. The reported "cluster
of rotating lights" was observed and reported by the source flying an
F-84 and by pilot of an F-94 as well as a B-26. This would tend to
lend credence to the observation. The disappearance of the object
to the west is considered significant. On the first sightings, the
curve of pursuit was flown breaking 1st, on the second pass it was
flown breaking right. There the phenomenon a reflection of the moon
off the windshield, it would have disappeared in the opposite direction
or the second pass. There are too many limitations of the presence
of something for the source's remarks to be considered an observation
of nothing.

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
HOWARD L. BEVIS, PRESIDENT
COLUMBUS 10

19 May 53

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB.

Dear Lt. Olsson;

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss Gluck officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments of each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each folder. The letter method has obvious drawbacks. But until that time comes and she can handle my typing and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only 4 really interesting cases. I might mention a 5th, 28 March 53, Scott AFB, which is the 1st report I've seen of an honest to goodness mirage. 6 Cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those.

8 April was a meteor.

The Great Falls 3 April case was Venus if reported time was in error.

28 March Albrook AFB was pr/obably Venus.
31 March Honolulu, and 30 March Lyle, Wash., are puzzling but could possibly have been balloons.

The 8-April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.

This brings us to the interesting cases:
25 March San Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no radar pickup. Was there any aircraft like helicopters that might explain this. Anything more done in on this one? Don't think this is good enough for a pinch-bottle but it should be listed as Nocturnal meandering; Right.

29 March Spooner, Wisc. Duration times needs checking here. Tend to believe that object could have done all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one of the regular questionnaires should be sent to Mr. Gillette.

Next is the 12 April Stead AFB. I think this is the most interesting case of the batch, and I hope you receive more data. Questionnaires should be sent. I'd like to see Menzel explain this one! Is there any possibility that these could have been aircraft? Apparently ducks have been eliminated.

(As for the 26 March) Equasseur AFB although NLM, the data are contradictory and insufficient. Perhaps this was a helicopter? We ought to have much more information on this one. Has this been received?

Sincerely,

FROM: D/r, Hqs, JADP, APO 710                REPORT NO. TR-13-53        PAGE 2 OF 3

1. Description: On 31 March 1953 an unidentified object was sighted and observed from 1935T to 2005T. It appeared to be a very bright light, similar to a star, about 20° above the horizon and on a 330° magnetic bearing from points of observation, seeming to change color from white to red to blue. It appeared to be a round white object with a red log protruding from its lower left side at about 7 o'clock, and a blue leg protruding from its lower right side at about 5 o'clock. The object appeared to swivel around. Over an initial 1.5 minute period during the sighting the object seemed to drop to a lower altitude and grow bigger and brighter. It seemed to "pull off and leave" pilot, who had attempted to pursue the object, after it had moved from a 330° to 290° magnetic bearing and appeared almost out of sight at 2005T. No aerodynamic features, trail, exhaust, propulsion system, speed or sound were observed.

2. Time of Sighting: 1935T - 2005T, 31 March 1953

3. Manner of Observation: Visual by pilot of F-84 flying at 30,000 feet at speed of 300 - 350 mph. No optical or electronic equipment used.

4. Location of Observer: Between Matsushima, Japan (38°24'N, 141°15'E), w/o Hill, 000(N) and Niigata, Japan (37°57'N, 139°08'E).

5. Information on Observer: Major Eugene S. Williams, AO 447471, possesses considerable experience in the USAF, performs a substantial amount of flight flying, and is a thoroughly reliable officer.

6. Weather: Pilot described the night as being "very clear with very good visibility after the moon came up." 20th Weather Squadron Report on Weather Conditions: General Picture: High pressure covered the area. Clouds: Scattered clouds at 2500 ft, Broken clouds at 7000 ft, tops 8000 ft, Clear above 8000 ft.
Visibility: Unrestricted
Winds: At 30,000 ft, 300 degrees 60 knots.
Temperature: At 30,000 ft, minus 48°C
Dew Point: Rising at 1857T
A thorough study of weather data at the time and place of sighting showed of no unusual inversion layers at any level.

7. Negative.

8. Negative.

9. Interception: Pilot attempted to chase object for a period of 10 minutes, but it appeared to move out of sight by the end of this 10 minute period.

10. Location of Air Traffic in Area: Other aircraft in general area were contacted by pilot who made no report, but they were not probably not contributing to this object sighting. Any further traffic in this area is unknown.

D/T Japan Air Defense Force Comment:

Reference earlier reports: IR-4-52, IR-5-52, IR-3-52, all dated 30 December 1952 and submitted by 616th Air Base Wing, APO 919; and FL/SOJRT dated 31 December 1952 (Colonel Blacklow, 27th Fighter Escort Wing), attached.

The above reports are referenced in view of certain parallel conditions existing in those reports and subject report dated 2 April 1953. The time of object sighting, relative of sighting aircraft, description of object sighted and weather conditions are very similar in each of these reports.

20th Weather Squadron (this headquarters) prepared a weather study as it applied to the period concerned. This Antecedent has been entered under paragraph 6 of basic report. They have suggested that no unusual inversion layers existed at time of sighting.

The oscillation of the radio compass in aircraft involved in this sighting, as indicated in Major Williams' statement, has been subjected to further study, but this headquarters has been unable to develop any definite reduction of factors which may have contributed to this oscillation.

I was scheduled to fly the night of 31 March 1953, in an F-84 aircraft.
I took off from Komaki AB, Honshu, Japan on the first leg of a round robin flight.
From Komaki, Tokyo, Atsugi, Hikanawa and return. The night was very clear and
visibility after the moon came up, was very good. After I had completed the
second leg of the course, I turned toward Nigata, time 1935L. I was flying
at 30,000 feet, 300 mph indicated, ground speed 540 mph approx. I fly a lot at
night (17 hours during March, 87 hours during last six months) and I was observing
the stars. I noticed a very bright light that I took to be a star, about 20
degrees above the horizon, bearing 300 degrees magnetic. It seemed to be changing
color, from white, to red, to blue. I watched it intermittently for 15 minutes and
noticed that it had lowered to a level altitude and was much bigger and brighter.
The horizon was very bright and no extra were discernable until about 20 degrees
above the horizon. I was having trouble with my radio compass as it wouldn't
steer but kept oscillating. I kept watching the light and finally called another
flight of two F-84s that were 5 minutes ahead of me and asked them if they had any
very bright lights on, such as a landing light. In was a Collin question, since
F-84s don't have lights like that, but I thought I might be looking at them (the
other F-84s) and not realizing it. They answered in the negative.
Finally, in the vicinity of Niigata, I decided that it was definitely some-
thing strange. I called the other flight and asked them if they could see this
light. Again the answer was negative. When I passed over Niigata, I decided to
see if I could get closer to this light. I turned and continued to observe the light.
330 degrees. I turned out my running lights and continued to observe the light.
Time 1955.
All the observations were the same, as follows:
A white light that appeared to have a red and blue beam of light
originating near the bottom of the white light. These beams could be
seen shining downward and sideways, reflecting through the light haze,
and kept swiveling around. The red and blue lights would beam directly
into my eyes every 30 or 40 feet as I swiveled around. There was no ex-
haust trail observed.
I zoomed the cool and indicated 350 mph. The light gradually changed
position from a 330 degree bearing to 290 degrees and pulled off me left me
after chasing it for 10 minutes it was almost out of sight, so I turned and flew
back to Niigata and then continued my flight. My radio compass worked off from
then on and I observed no other lights or objects. My oxygen system was opera-
tive and my cabin pressure was 18,000 feet.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: FLYOBRT REPORT

AIR FORCE LETTER NO. 205-5, 8th AF I.G. Pn Afd 15 Aug 52

SUMMARY:
1. The sources whose information comprises this report, experienced two sightings of an unidentified flying object. Both sightings provided the sources with some unusual exhibit of the object's position. The "rotating cluster of lights" title best illustrates the general nature of the object, but is further enhanced by the supporting evidence of three beams of white light set around its periphery. Inclusive number 2 leads this with a visual report that the source saw, enclosure number 2 aids in readily scaling the area of these sightings and the 8th Air Force Flight during the sightings.

2. Unevaluated "hear-say" reports from other agencies in this area increase the strength of those sightings, since the term "two-lights" seems to most easily explain the phenomenon. These scattered "hear-say" reports once more provide by allied intelligence agencies at the scene, should add more to the substance of this specific sighting.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: - A single flying object of unknown actual size. At initial sightings, observer was certain it was larger and brighter than any of the stars or other heavenly bodies. Since the pilot making the observation was flying an F-84-G at the time, he was unable to note whether the object was accompanied by any sound. Its means of propulsion was likewise unknown. First impression of description offered by the observer was that this object appeared to be a cluster of lights, rotating slowly in a counter-clockwise direction. Or from a more accurate description, the object had no visible effects. Its body whose shape can only be assumed to be circular, gave off three colors, i.e. red, white and green. These are the colors that were rotating, with the exception, that this constant during both observations (totalling 12 minutes). The shifting of the three colors during color rotation was similar to the changes in colors often seen in no polar masks of Juke-Boxes. As these colors rotated in the body of the object, at times the entire body was one solid color, i.e. either white, green or red - but in the process of completing a revolution, the body was frequently made white or white/green plus the other possible combinations of the three colors. Possibly the center of the body) the most prominent feature of the description appeared to be the three beams of light that worked from the body outward in straight shafts of white light. These three beams never changed their relative positions, and actually were located at about 11 o'clock, - 5 o'clock, and 7 o'clock. These white beams did not shift around as searchlights would, but maintained their constant position on the body, even much like two legs pointing with one remaining leg displaced from the top or the object to a point approximately 11 o'clock. It is possible that the two lower legs could have been a bit higher on the bottom side of the body, say at the 4:30 and 7:30 positions of the clock. The observer recalls that the upper beam located just off center appeared to be exactly opposite the lower right beam and established a one way balance for effect. The object as a whole gave an overall impression, except for an almost gradual change of direction during the two observations. The observer acknowledged to himself that this spread of revolution of the three color series in the body, and it is loosely estimated at 4 to 8 seconds. There was no exhaust noticed during either observation.

2. TIMES OF SIGHTING: - The source experienced the sighting of this object on two occasions. A short interval of time intervening than. The first sighting was at 1948 hrs, item time, and second sighting commenced at 2000 hrs and was terminated at 2005 hrs. Item.

3. MANNER OF OBSERVATION: - Both sightings were made visually by the pilot of an F-84-G aircraft. Such pilot was engaged in local area night flying. His first observation was made at 27,000 ft altitude; the object stayed in his view while he climbed to 35,000 ft - at which point he was level with it. His second sighting of the object was also at 35,000 ft altitude. During one period, the pilot noticed the object was orbiting 330 kts. approximately in a radius of 468 kts. and true ground speed of 412 kts. At the time of attempting closure on the object, the pilot was within 1/2 mile of the Mach - for this aircraft, F-84-G, -82.
