5. Major Gedeon is believed to be a fairly competent witness in
that he is serious minded, not given to fancy or exaggeration. In his
own mind there is no doubt that the object sighted was not a meteor.

6. In order to supplement the information originally submitted,
Major Gedeon has completed a questionnaire supplied by OSI. (Enclosure 2).

7. The above is furnished for whatever value it may have.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Objects

TO:   Director of Intelligence
       Headquarters USAF
       Washington 25, D. C.

1. This office submitted a report (copy attached as Inclosure 1) dated 23 February 1952, concerning a sighting of an unidentified object, reported by two officers of this Command.

2. Subsequently, this Headquarters received an ATIC report (Project BLUE BOOK, Report No. 5) dated 31 March 1952, which made reference to the above report (reference page 5, item 5) with the following comment:

"description similar to meteor"

3. It is the opinion of this office that the conclusions arrived at are in error. Subsequent conversations with Major Gedeon reveal the followings:

a. That he has observed meteors and in this instance the course of the object appears to be a straight line and did not have the characteristic orbit of a meteor.

4. Although it was impossible to estimate the speed of the object, inasmuch as the lateral distance or the object east of the course was a matter of conjecture, the duration of sighting, approximately one minute, would tend to preclude conventional type aircraft. In this respect, however, the ACS/A asked Major Gedeon whether he had ever observed an experimental type high intensity rotational aircraft marker, which it is understood Capital Air Lines was experimenting with, in lieu of the conventional "flasher" warning lights. Major Gedeon had not observed this device in flight; however, the ACS/A offered as conjecture that this type of warning light possibly could account for what Major Gedeon had witnessed. Again, the duration of sighting would tend to argue against this possibility, unless it were using tested on a jet type aircraft.

                                                                        DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVAL

XXXXX

JUN 28 1952

Capital Airlines, Inc.
Washington National Airport
Washington 4, D.C.

Gentlemen:

The Air Force has recently re-opened the study of a report of an unidentified aerial object (saucer referred to as a "UFO; unidentified flying object") which occurred near the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between 3:00 a.m. and 3:45 a.m. on the morning of 11 February 1952. The object, sighted by two Air Force pilots, was described as a bright, white, round to oval, glowing object traveling in a southerly direction.

It is understood that Capital Airlines is or has been experimenting with a new high intensity rotating marker light and that Capital Flight 610 is in the area of Pittsburgh near 3:00 a.m.

This Center could like to know, if the information is available, whether or not a typical flight could have been in the area on the date and time mentioned above, if an aircraft's equipped with the experimental light was in the area, that time did it arrive and depart Pittsburgh?

Your cooperation in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Very truly yours,

DONALD L. BOUY
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Technical Analysis Division

AF FORM 112—PART I
UNCLASSIFIED

USA-MATS
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects

Dated: 19 February 1952
Prepared by: Robert E. Mullin, Captain, USAFR

SUMMARY:
The following report was made by Captain Ellis M. Woodward, and Major Clifford G. Moeller, pilot and co-pilot, respectively, of a MATS C-47 aircraft on a local flight from Andrews Air Force Base, Washington, D. C.:

a. Bright white object, with no sign of trailing streaks of light, beams, or glowing characteristics, at an estimated distance of 8 to 10 miles it appeared to be traveling at an altitude of 7500 to 8500 feet and seemed to be about 1/6 the size of the rising moon. The object was observed twice. On the first occasion it was traveling very slowly for a moment but accelerated very rapidly and disappeared to the southwest of Washington, D. C. within 2 minutes. On the second occasion the object approached Washington from the south and east, then made a left turn to the city. When within 2 to 3 miles SSE of Washington the object appeared to hold its position for approximately one minute and then disappeared from sight almost immediately.

b. The first sighting was made at approximately 2030 hours on 12 February 1952; the second was made at about 2100 hours that same evening. In each instance the object was observed for from 2 to 3 minutes.

c. The object was observed visually by the two pilots who were flying a MATS C-47 (#5936) aircraft at an altitude of 9000 feet.

d. The two observers were between Friendship Airfield and Baltimore, Maryland, on the first occasion and on the second they were approximately 10 miles south of Baltimore. In the first instance the object appeared to be 8 to 10 miles distant; the second time it seemed to be 15 to 20 miles away.

e. Both observers are experienced pilots with the Air Resupply and Communications Service. In addition, Captain Woodward is an Intelligence Officer.

f. There has been no report of any activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sightings.

g. No photographs were taken nor was any physical evidence obtained.

h. No interception or identification action was attempted.

The document is marked "UNCLASSIFIED" and appears to be an official Air Force report about a UFO sighting.

APPENDIX IV

Washington, D. C. Area - 12 February 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On 12 February 1952, two MATS pilots flying a C-47 on a local flight observed a bright white object which appeared to be at 7,500 ft. to 8,500 ft. and about one-sixth the size of a rising moon.

The object was observed twice. The first time at 2030 IST, the C-47 was between Baltimore and Baltimore Friendship Airport. The object was estimated to be eight to ten miles away travelling slowly for a moment but then accelerated very rapidly and disappeared southwest of Washington, D. C.

The second time the object was observed was at about 2100 EST, the C-47 was about ten miles south of Baltimore at the time. The object appeared to approach Washington from the south east, making a left turn toward the city. When it was within two or three miles ESE of Washington, it appeared to hover for about one minute and then it disappeared.

In both instances the object was observed for two or three minutes.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

The description of this incident is very similar to the one reported on 28 December 1951 that proved to be a helicopter carrying experimental lighting. However, checks on local traffic did not reveal a helicopter in the area on this date.

III. CONCLUSIONS

None.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS:
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

SUBJECT: Report of Unusual Flying Object

TO:   DCS/Intelligence
       Headquarters Tactical Air Command
       Langley Air Force Base, Virginia

Captain George P. Arms, HQ 47th Bomb Wing, and I were flying a T-11 aircraft, number 41-27496 from Cleveland, Ohio to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, 11 Feb 52, when an unusual flying object was sighted near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

A cold front cloud buildup had been encountered Southeast of Pittsburgh that could not be topped or penetrated so we changed our flight plan to land at Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

As we approached Pittsburgh from the south at approximately 5,000 feet, a brilliant lighted object was seen high to the north (1 o'clock high), flying a reciprocal course (approx South) to ours. This sighting occurred between 0300 and 0315 EST. At first we thought an aircraft was on its way between Pittsburgh and Williams AFB, an orange flame appearance and yellow to orange flame coloration of the object. However, as the object approached a 3 o'clock high position, regular, one to two second pulsations of the plane was noted, which continued until the object passed out of sight.

Both of us though, it was a jet, because of its speed, however, neither of us have ever seen a pulsating flame emitted from a jet at night. The sighting reminded me of buzz-bombs that I had seen many times in Belgium during last war. However, the buzz-bomb fraction or the size, and was continuous. The object definitely was in excess of five (5) miles from our position. This estimate was based on the location of the cloud buildup on our right several miles, over which the object flew and disappeared from sight. The cloud buildup was between 12,700 and 15,000 feet high (estimate).

The sky was clear and well illuminated by a bright moon above the clouds, affording continuous unobstructed observation of the object for approximately one minute prior to disappearing from sight.

We landed at Pittsburgh at 0330 hours.

            A cold front cloud buildup had been encountered southeast of Pitts-
burgh that could not be topped or penetrated so we changed our flight plan
to land at Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

            As we approached Pittsburgh from the South at approximately 5,000
feet, a brilliant lighted object was seen high to the right (1 o'clock
high), flying a reciprocal course (approx south) to ours. This sighting
occurred between 0300 and 0315 EST. At first we thought an aircraft was
on fire because of the brilliance and comet-like appearance and yellow to
orange flame coloration of the object. However, as the object approached
a 3 o'clock high position, regular, one to two second pulsations of the
flame was noted, which continued until the object passed out of sight.
Both of us thought it was a jet because of the speed; however, neither of
us have ever seen a pulsating flame emitted from a jet at night. The
sighting reminded me of buzz-bombs that I had seen many times in Belgium
during the last war. However, the buzz-bomb flame was only a fraction of
the size, and was continuous. The object definitely was in excess of five
(5) miles from our position. This estimate was based on the location of
the cloud buildup on our right several miles, over which the object flew
and disappeared from sight. The cloud buildup was between 12,000 and
15,000 feet high (estimate).

            The sky was clear and well illuminated by a bright moon above the
clouds, affording continuous unobstructed observation of the object for
approximately one minute prior to disappearance from sight.

            We landed at Pittsburgh at 0330 hours.
