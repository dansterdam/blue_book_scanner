SACINTSUM No. 726 - Goose Bay, Labrador

UNCLASSIFIED

At 0305% and at 0825% on 2 May 1953 two unidentified objects were observed from Goose Bay area. The first consisted of a sighting of an unidentified light by an F-94 under CAFU conditions. As the F-94 gave chase, the light out ran a similar object, believed to be the same one as the F-94 sighted, was reported from the Goose Bay tower and described as going at a "terrific rate of speed". According to this source, the light was probably an unidentified a/c.

The second observation was also from the air, when the pilot and copilot of a commercial airlines reported sighting two luminous objects approximately 500' off the right wing of their a/c. The plane was located 130 miles SE of Goose Bay at the time of sighting.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Most of the first paragraphs are partially illegible due to image quality]

5. Statement of Captain R. L. Emery, pilot of Pin T-41-402:

"On the night of 1 May 1953 I was the pilot of Pin T-41-402, an F94 aircraft.
I have 2,500 hours flying time, of which 500 hours are in jet aircraft.

I first saw the object at 62°25'52" and had visual contact for 15 to 20 minutes.
The object was long and thin, somewhat like a cigar, at an angle of about 45 degrees.
I sighted it at 44,000 feet and the object was about 15,700 feet below me, giving
me a good look. The object was definitely stationary. It was well defined and
quite distinct. I was unsuccessful locating the object's exact position or size.
The object was a solid light. The position of the object was constant. There was no
visible exhaust. I was unable to get definite color of the object, and its motion
was none."

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. A close study of this report indicates the object was a meteor or similar aerial phenomenon which Park and I have studied.

2. The executive staff of the subject (illegible word) realizes the possibility of a natural explanation.

3. Since the only data available is from pilot's observation, it is impossible to make a definitive statement.
