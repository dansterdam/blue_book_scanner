NAME: [redacted]
SIGNATURE: [redacted]
DATE: July 26, 1953

At 1145 AM on July 3, 1953, Mrs. [redacted] and myself were sitting on a grass lawn at East 9th and Lake Streets, Reno, Nevada. Mrs. [redacted] had been looking up through some tree branches and drew my attention to an object. In the air, it was quite distant, and she located it for me with reference to a tree branch. I watched the object for about 8 minutes, thinking it might possibly be a white balloon. It was not likely to be a car, because the day was bright (hot) and cloudless.

However, it neither moved or changed in apparent size.

I therefore decided to report it to the nearest policeman, thinking I would here instructions to report through channels. However, he was not interested and suggested I call Police Headquarters, which I did.

Police Headquarters (1200 Noon) were not interested and suggested I call Sheriff's Office.

Sheriff's Office said this was outside their jurisdiction and to call Army.

I called 4 Army numbers listed in the telephone book, but no answer.

I then called the FBI, who took my name and address. I told them I could not locate the object anywhere except from beneath the tree at the base of the sighting. The two branches of a reference point, I thereupon returned to 4. 9th and Lake St., where Mrs. [redacted] was still watching it. After 20 minutes (1215P), being somewhat surprised they had no one had reported to verify the sighting, as a result of my report to FBI, and considering the possibility that an outside light have been made to the FBI, I again telephone them. I was told that they were going to be difficult to get any official verification while the object was still in view, I obtained from the FBI the name of the officer to whom the report had been made.

The name was Col. Sanson.

In size it was somewhat smaller than the head of a pin held at arm's length.

The object was not an airplane, or balloon. Conceivably a star, but this is very doubtful in my mind.

We encountered no interest in this sighting from any of the several authorities and Army Officers with whom we talked, and this is difficult to understand unless such sightings are a known quantity and fully understood. I don't think I shall again go to so much trouble in attempting to get attention if I should make another sighting.

After some difficulty I reached Col Samson by telephone, who advised me that the report had been turned over to Col. Olerick, who told me that he was turning the matter over to Col. Worth. I got the impression that someone would come to verify the sighting, and returned to the scene, where the object was still visible, while not appearing to move, it had shifted position slightly because it was necessary for us to move, occasionally, to navigate.

12:55PM. No one having arrived to verify sighting, I again called Col. Worth to ask him if he could not send someone. He requested that I stand by the telephone and he would call me back. This he did at 1:10 PM, requesting that I obtain a disinterested person to verify the sighting. I stopped a car and requested the driver to observe it. This he did, giving his name as Prof. _______, now 1:30PM, Professor of Geology, University of Nevada. The time was now 1:30PM.

I could not reach Col. Worth by phone until 1:45PM, when I reported the verification. Col. Worth then stated he would send two enlisted men to our Motel for "debriefing".

1:50 PM. We returned to 9th and Lake Streets, but could not again locate the object.

2:30 PM. Two Sergeants visited us at our Motel, expressing appreciation of our efforts and stating that Army was very interested in all such reports. I pointed out then that Army had been aware of the sighting over our hour during which the object could be seen, but hadn't been interested enough to look at it.

I have spent 15 years in Air Line work as Meteorologist and Radio Communications. [I am not now so engaged].

Any guess as to altitude or size of the object would be subject to wide error from a visual appraisal for reasons well known. I would guess the altitude to have been between 40 and 70 thousand feet -- the latter altitude only if the object was quite large. In size it was somewhat smaller than the head of a pin held at arm's length.

The object was not an airplane, or balloon. Conceivably a star, but this is very doubtful in my mind.

3 July 1953                                                                 Reno, Nevada

Description

At 1145 A.M. MST 3 June 1953 two civilians were sitting on a lawn at Reno, Nevada. One observer was looking up through some tree branches when she saw a pin-point of light at a very high altitude. She called her husband's attention to the object and he watched this object for 8 minutes, thinking it was a weather balloon. He thought that it was not likely to be a star, because the day was bright (hot) and cloudless. However, it neither moved nor changed its apparent size. The observer left his wife to watch the object while he reported it to the authorities. First he reported it to a policeman who referred him to the Police Station. They were not interested and told him to report it to the sheriff's office. The sheriff's office stated that this sighting was out of their jurisdiction and for him to call the FBI. The FBI took his name and address. The observer then told the FBI that he could locate the object unless he had this particular tree as a reference point. He then returned to the point of observation where his wife still had the object in view. After 20 minutes, being somewhat surprised that no one had appeared to verify the sighting and considering the possibility that a mistake had been made, he reported location of the sighting, he again telephoned the FBI. He was told that the matter had been referred to Stead AF Base. The observer becoming aware that it was going to be difficult to get any verification chose still to obtain the name of the USAF colonel to which the report had been made. After some difficulty, the observer reached this colonel by telephone. This colonel referred the incident to another colonel who in turn referred this to a third colonel. From the last colonel that he talked to, he got the impression that someone would come to verify the sighting and returned to the scene where the object was still visible. While not appearing to move, it had shifted position slightly because it was necessary for him to move occasionally to prevent its being obscured by the tree branches. After waiting 30 minutes, the observer again called the Air Force colonel to ask him if he couldn't send someone to verify the sighting. The colonel reassured that the observer stand by the telephone and he would call him back. This the colonel did 15 minutes later, requesting that the observer obtain a disinterested person to verify the sighting. Observer returned to site of observation and the object was still visible. He stopped a car and requested the driver to observe the object. The driver of the car was a professor at the University of Nevada and a very good observer. Observer again called the Air Force colonel and reported the verification. The colonel then stated that he would send 2 enlisted men to the observers' motel for a debriefing. Two sergeants visited the observers at their motel expressing appreciation for the observers' efforts and stating that the Air Force was very interested in such reports. Observer pointed out to the sergeants that the Air Force had been aware of the sighting for over an hour during which time the object could be seen but hadn't been interested enough to look at it.

Discussion
This sighting is one of the best in Project Blue Book's files as far as civilian observers are concerned. These civilians were very diligent in their efforts to report the sighting and it is unfortunate that the officials in that area were not aware of the procedure for reporting the unidentified flying objects. The description of this object, and the length of time observed rules out any conventional objects in our atmosphere. Project Blue Book's contract astronomers were contacted. They stated that this sighting was undoubtedly caused by the planet Venus.

Conclusion
Was astronomical (Venus).

FROM (Lipton)                                       REPORT NO.
3904th Comp Wg, Stend AFB                           3904-3-53                PAGE 1 OF 1

1. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] first observed object at 1120 Pacific Time over
Reno, Nevada (39/23N-119/47W). Observation continued until 1315 hours. At that
time they stopped a witness, Professor [redacted]. They then proceeded to call
Stend Air Force Base. Returning to continued observation they found object had
disappeared.

2. Object observed was a metallic white circular in shape at approximate
20,700 to 30,000 feet. No trail or exhaust was observed; no sound was heard.
Estimated speed of object was nil, but would shift slightly at times.

3. United Airlines and Stend Mr Force base weather stations were notified
but were unable to confirm sighting. The weather station at Stend Air Force
Base does not release any weather balloons. The weather station at United Airlines
released balloons at 0700 and 1300 hours on 3 July 1953.

4. Aircraft in the area at time of sighting were as follows:
    a. Stend Air Force Base:
        1 C-47 - Airborne all the time of sighting
        1 C-54 - 1127 hours (departing)
        1 B-25 - 1231 hours (departing)
        1 F-80 - 1337 hours (landing)
        1 C-97 - 1400 hours (landing)

    b. United Airlines, Reno, Nevada:
        1 DC-3 - Landing (this was observed by [redacted])

5. Weather in the area was clear, no clouds and visibility 15 plus. Wind
was east at three miles per hour, temperature 79 degrees relative humidity 12 per
cent.

COMMENTS:
1. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] from Alameda, California.

2. Mr. [redacted] was a professor of Geology at the University of Nevada.
The professor thought the object may have been a star. The professor was in a hurry
and was unable to make observation for more than a few minutes. Mr. [redacted] disagrees because of the fact that the object moved at times.
