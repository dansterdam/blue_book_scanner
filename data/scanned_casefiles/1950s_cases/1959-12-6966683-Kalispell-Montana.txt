K DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE COMMENTS: THIS REPORT WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED
BY MR. _____ TO THE SHERIFF OF KALISPELL, WHO IN TURN PHONED THE
REPORT TO MISSOULA RADIO. THIS IN TURN WAS PASSED TO GREAT FALLS ARTC
AND GIVEN TO THE 29TH AIR DIVISION SENIOR CONTROLLER ON DUTY. THE
391ST AND 431ST ACRONS WITH FPS-20, AROUND RADAR, WERE CHECKED TO
SEE IF THIS SIGHTING WAS CONFIRMED ON THEIR SETS. THESE SQUADRONS
WERE CARRYING THE TANKER AND BOMBER PLUS FRIENDLY FIGHTERS FROM GEIGER
AFB, WASHINGTON IN THAT AREA DURING THE PERIOD OF SIGHTING. NOTHING
UNUSUAL WAS NOTED IN THE RADAR SETS AT THIS TIME. THE LIGHT WHICH
APPEARED TO BE ON THE NOSE OF THE OBJECT COULD BE THE LIGHT WHICH IS
LOCATED ON THE END OF THE DROGUE TO ASSIST THE RECEIVER PILOT IN
MAKING CONTACT. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THIS TYPE OF LIGHT WOULD BE
VISIBLE FROM THE GROUND. THE LONG OBJECT COULD BE EXPLAINED POSSIBLY
BY THE FACT, TWO AIRCRAFT WHEN COUPLED TOGETHER IN AN AERIAL REFUEL-
ING PRESENT A LONGER PROFILE WHEN VIEWED FROM THE GROUND AT AN ANGLE
LESS THAN 90 DEG.
