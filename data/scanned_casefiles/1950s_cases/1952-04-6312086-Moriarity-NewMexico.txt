1. There seems to be two or more possible explanations of the unidentified target reported by attached Form 112:
a. Radar target was caused by an actual airborne target.
b. Interference from a purposely "locked-on" jamming or confusion transmitter.
c. Other less likely causes such as equipment fault, weather, etc.

2. Since the path of the radar target was along a straight line passing thru the radar station location, it is considered more likely that the explanation given in paragraph 1b is applicable.

I, Captain _______, Aircraft Control and Warning Station, Moriarty, New Mexico, do hereby wish to make the following statement:
At 0:42 a.m., 30 April 1952, the _______ on duty, A/2C _______, received a report of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) near Moriarty, New Mexico. I was immediately notified and I visually observed the objects approximately 5 miles east of Moriarty at an approximate altitude of 12,000 feet. The objects were approximately 30 feet in diameter and were traveling at a speed of approximately 600 mph. I immediately notified the 2nd Air Division Office at Kirtland Air Force Base and the objects were still visible in the next 20 minutes when the BIP was again at 23:00 o'clock and at a range of approximately 26 miles from my position. The objects appeared to have completed approximately 2 revolution or turns per minute and would disappear intermittently for periods of 2-5 seconds and then reappear in the same general area. The objects appeared to be very brightly illuminated and were not blurred in any manner, which can only be described as the type of light that is different from the normal type one sees. The maneuvers of the objects was very impressive. 
Attached hereto is the approximate path of flight the trip was in as I saw it.

Commanding General,
Tenth Air Force,
Moriarity, New Mexico.

At 0715, 30 April 1952, as I was on duty from 0001 to 0930, I observed an unusual aircraft which I believe to be a flying saucer. This saucer appeared approximately at 3,600 to 5,000 feet altitude, and was moving in a northerly direction at a very high rate of speed. The saucer appeared on the scope as a usual aircraft would appear, except that the pip was very much brighter. The saucer was also seen visually by Sergeant on duty with me. The saucer appeared on the scope for approximately 1 minute, 20 seconds, and then disappeared.

Attached hereto is the approximate path of flight the saucer was in as I saw it.

Warrant Officer Squadron, Moriarity, New Mexico, do hereby with to make the following statement:

At 0730 MST I took my position on CIT scope #1 (range 30-50 miles). At approximately 0740 MST I noticed a blip at 3350 at 11,000 feet. This blip appeared to circle the field, then headed southwest at a fast speed, then appeared to stop, hovered for a while, and then I continued watching this blip until it faded from my scope.

The first unusual blip had to appear faded when at approximately 0755 another blip appeared at 2200 at the same alt. This blip like the one before circled the field, then headed east until it faded from my scope about 70 miles away.

Attached hereto is the approximate path of flight the blip was in.

It was moving very fast, approximately 1500 mph. I attempted to scramble a jet but the aircraft was no longer in range. The blip faded from my scope at 2752 ft. I was unable to locate the object on my radar. It appeared to be flying at an altitude of 2752 ft. To the best of my knowledge, this was not interference.

APPENDIX V
Moriarity, New Mexico - 13 April 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 13 April 1952 at 16:45 MST, four airmen observed a silver, disc-shaped object east of Moriarity, New Mexico. The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and the airmen were unable to ascertain its altitude. The object was observed for several minutes and they all agreed that its speed and manueverability eliminated that possibility.
The time of observation was judged to be from four to ten minutes.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Both Moriarity, New Mexico, and Albuquerque have radar but no unusual returns were noted on 13 April.
A piball balloon was released from Albuquerque at 1400 MST. The winds, however, were about 4 knots out of the northeast in the Moriarity area, and the balloon soared easterly, away from Moriarity. It is possible the balloon looked and leveled off at a low altitude, however, it would have been south of the observation point. The speed and maneuvers do not correlate with a normal balloon's drift except for the possibility that there might have been some strong winds at the time. This cannot be ascertained and the object must remain unidentified.

III. CONCLUSIONS
None.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, likely an official report or analysis regarding a fireball sighting on April 25, 1952.

The text in the document is as follows:

1952 April 25.60 G.M.T. 
A.M.S. No. 2395

In our files are found 12 reports of an extremely brilliant fireball which appeared on the above date at 11.55 p.m. One of the 12 reports is from Washington, N.C, one from 5 miles south, one from 25 miles north, as all observers lay along a south north line. The fireball was observed by Donald Brogdon of Washington, N.C. who states that the fireball exploded with a blinding flash and was blue or green and its size excessive, estimates of the latter ranging from one-half to three times the size of the full moon. As observed through a telescope its angular diameter was about 5 degrees which would indicate a true size of about a mile in diameter. Further details show the duration of the passage 3 to 5 seconds, the path traversed as about 70 degrees, and the altitude at the beginning about 40 degrees, while at the end was about 10 degrees above the horizon. Declinational and linear heights can be obtained from the data. The path probably ended near the Vir-PC border. Evidently, however, it was not the Lyrid meteors, but some other phenomenon, though as yet no estimates could be obtained, it seemed worth while to put this remarkable fireball on record.

FIREBALL of 1951 August 10.61 G.M.T.
A.M.S. No. 2294

On this date at about 8:32 p.m., C.S.T., a fireball was observed from the Chicago-Milwaukee area, and some 225 reports were gathered by the A.M.S. Planetarium and eventually sent to A.M.S. headquarters. There has been a long delay in solving the path of the principal body to which these reports refer. A detailed study is planned and preliminary result indicates that the fireball came from the northwest. This is due to the fact, besides others, that the date, fireballs were doubtless present in numbers and some observers did not discern the length of the duration which was under one second, Enough brightness, however, to cause lights to be turned on in rooms where the flash was observed. Only about 6 people, tried to estimate sizes and attitudes, and neither of these as having any value for measurement. The half of the reports as having no value for these points.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 6 December 1952
DATE OF REPORT: 15 December 1952
PREPARED BY (OFFICER): Captain Lorence A. Wenger, USAF
UNIT: 1st Air Division (defensively)
SUMMARY: On 6 December 1952, at approximately 1600 hours, a series of four (4) bright, round, silver-colored objects were observed for a period of approximately five (5) minutes by Mr. Jack Barnett, a civilian resident of Moriarity, New Mexico. The objects were observed moving in a northerly direction at a high altitude over Moriarity and were estimated to be approximately 30,000 feet in altitude. The objects were noted to be moving at a high rate of speed, estimated to be at least 500 miles per hour. At times, the objects would accelerate and then decelerate, demonstrating a capability of high maneuverability. No sound was heard emanating from the objects. During the observation, the objects maintained a constant altitude and were observed to blink on and off occasionally. The objects were observed to disappear from view toward the north.
SIGNIFICANCE OF INCIDENT: There are two (2) unusual points concerning this incident:
1. The objects were observed by a reliable civilian witness, Mr. Jack Barnett, who has had considerable experience in observing aircraft.
2. The objects displayed a capability of high-speed, high-altitude flight and maneuverability which is not consistent with any known type of aircraft.
