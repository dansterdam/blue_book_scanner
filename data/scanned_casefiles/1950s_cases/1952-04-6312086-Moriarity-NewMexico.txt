1. There seems to be two or more possible explanations of the unidentified target reported by attached Form 112:

a. Radar target was caused by an actual airborne target.

b. Interference from a purposedly "locked-on" jamming or confusion transmitter.

c. Other less likely causes such as equipment fault, weather, etc.

2. Since the path of the radar target was along a straight line passing thru the radar station location, it is considered most likely that the explanation given in paragraph 1b is applicable.

30 April 1952

I, Captain [redacted], Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Moriarity, New Mexico, do hereby with to make the following statement:

At 072 MST, 30 April 1952, the [redacted] on duty, A/[redacted] informed me that something unusual was being sighted by the radar. I initially posted aerial myself as an observer and then the [redacted] at approximately 0746 MST a blip appeared at 110 miles on 270° azimuth, in the next sweep the blip was again at 230° azimuth and at a range of 129 miles. The blip observed continued moving on the 270° azimuth line at approximately 11 miles per sweep or 11 miles every 10 seconds. It failed at approximately 74 miles range which might indicate a terrific altitude. This represented no clearly defined track 100° heading. The blips observed were not blurred nor were they fuzzy blobs of a sort but rather they were very clearly defined blips which can only be described as the type of blip that is so hard every day made by conventional type aircraft. The terrific speed of this track as described above was very impressive.

Attached hereon is the approximate path of flight the blip was in as I saw it.

At 0742 MST, 30 April 1952, as [redacted] on duty from 0500 to 0700 MST, I was informed of an unusual blip on radar by scope operator on duty, A/1C [redacted]. Incidentally I passed this unusual occurrence on to the Control tower on duty, Cannon. At 0745 MST this blip first appeared approximately at 140 miles on 270° azimuth and this blip moved approximately 11 miles each sweep, every 10 seconds, for 6 sweeps. This blip moved approximately 70 miles from station. This blip appeared on the scope as a usual aircraft would appear, except for its speed.

I, A/1C [redacted], Warning Squadron, Moriarity, New Mexico, do hereby wish to make the following statement:

At 0730 SST I took my position on 113 scope #1 (range 50-140 miles). At approximately 0740 SST I noticed an blip at 220° at 110 miles. I was preparing to call it in as an initial blip when on the next sweep I had moved 11 miles to the N. I reported this to the Crew Chief and then I continued watching this blip until it faded 1 sweep later.

The first unusual blip had no sooner faded when at approximately 0745 MST another blip appeared at 220° at 110 miles. This blip looked like the other moved at the rate of 11 miles per sweep (6 sweeps per minute). It continued west toward Cleveland until it faded at a point about 70 miles from our station.

Attached hereon is the approximate path of flight the blip was in as I saw it.

APPENDIX V
Moriarity, New Mexico - 13 April 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On 13 April 1952 at 1645 MST, four airmen observed a silver, disc-shaped object east of Moriarity, New Mexico. The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and its flight path was very erratic. The object was assumed to be disc-shaped due to the fact that it appeared to tip edgewise and disappear for an instant. When first noticed, the object was thought to be a high flying jet aircraft but all the observers are familiar with jet aircraft and they all agreed that its speed and maneuverability eliminated that possibility.

The time of observation was judged to be from four to ten minutes.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

Both Moriarity, New Mexico, and Albuquerque have radar but no unusual returns were noted on 13 April.

A pibal balloon was released from Albuquerque at 1400 MST. The winds, however, would have carried this balloon south of Moriarity. In addition, the balloon would have risen too high to be observed after two hours and 45 minutes. It is possible the balloon leaked and leveled off at a low altitude, however, it would have been south of the observation point. The speed and maneuvers do not correlate with a normal balloon drift. Except for the possibility that there might have been some strong winds at the time, this cannot be ascertained and the object must remain unidentified.

III. CONCLUSIONS

None.

25/Apr. 1952

American Meteor Society Proc.
Pr. 1169 by, Dr. H. Nininger

1952 April 25.69 G.M.T.
A.M.S. No. 2395

In our files are found 12 reports of an extremely brilliant fireball which appeared on the above date at 11:28 p.m., E.S.T. Out of the 12 reports, 10 came from Wilmington, N.C., one from 5 miles south, one from 25 miles north, so all observers by along an north north line. The reports were gathered by Donald Strayhorn of Wilmington, then an active A.M.S. member. The reports were unanimous that the fireball's color was blue or green and its size excessive, estimates of the latter running from one half to three times the size of full Moon. Allowing for probable exaggeration, its apparent diameter must have approximated 15' to 20'. Based on 9 estimates, the duration was 3.06 -to 6.76 sec. -- a smaller average error than usual. From 9 stations the path was reported as vertical or almost so, and the beginning altitude was 45° or greater, and the end at north point at about 5° altitude. As the sideral time was about 13.33, the right ascension of the radiant would, for a vertical path, approximate that. No information on the radiant's declination nor linear heights can be obtained from the data. Its path probably ended near the Va. N.C. border. Evidently, however, it was not from the Lyrid radiant, but may well have come from A.M.S. fireball radiant No. 856. Though all the usual results could not be obtained it seemed worth while to put this remarkable fireball on record.

FIREBALL of 1961 August 10.61 G.M.T.
A.M.S. No. 2294

On this date at about 8:32 p.m., C.S.T., a fireball was observed from the Chicago-Milwaukee area, and some 250 reports were gathered by the Adler Planetarium and eventually sent to A.M.S. headquarters. There has been a long delay in solving the path of the principal body to which these reports refer. A detailed study indicated that 30 or more referred to a second bright object, seen to the northeast, while, due to the date, Persids were doubtless present in numbers and some observers did not differentiate between an ordinary meteor and the fireball in question. Despite these complications a solution has finally been obtained. Unfortunately only about 5 people tried to refer the path of end of it to stars, Ursa Major being so used. All the rest depended upon estimates of both directions and altitudes, nobody seems to have used any instrument for measuring either coordinate.

A preliminary study weeded out about half of the reports as having no value for either coordinate. Further, estimates of altitudes of 60° and over were omitted, as almost nobody, without using star transit as a reference, can estimate such areas with even approximate accuracy, and heights depend upon the tangents of the angle, which become abnormally great over 60°. To determine the projected path, a chart of the region was prepared, scale 1' in latitude to 1mm. On this stations were plotted and examinith lines drawn showing the observed points, and in many cases intermediate. From this, despite the usual scatter, these points were derived and the projected path drawn. Then the linear height corresponding to observed altitudes were derived by measuring the distance to projected path from each station and taking the tangent of the altitude. Most did not see the beginning; point, but our derived beginning height depends upon 13 usable altitudes. The end point depends upon 43 altitudes. Joining these points by a straight line gives us the atmospheric path. Other estimates could be bunched into three heights. When plotted, these fit in tolerably well with path mentioned.

While the average deviations from the mean heights certainly show larger values than we could wish, yet in perspective they compare very favorably with those all observers get when measuring stellar parallaxes, and the latter are the very basis of stellar astronomy. So we lag the intelligence of astronomers and suggest that, while in a given case the fireball path and orbit derived certainly may be considerably in error, still statistically, they may be treated with more respect.
