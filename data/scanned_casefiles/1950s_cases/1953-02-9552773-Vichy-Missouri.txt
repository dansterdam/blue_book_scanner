AREA REPORTED ON: VICHY, MISSOURI 
DATE OF REPORT: 13 FEBRUARY 1953
DATE OF INFORMATION: 12 FEBRUARY 1953
REPORTED BY: Major C. L. Baules
REPORTED TO: Capt. Robert B. Bailey, AC-67125
APL 200-2, 29 APR 52 and TDY WODOO13RD, 12 FEBRUARY 1953
SUMMARY: Capt. Robert B. Bailey, AC-67125, an ATRG staff pilot, saw an unidentified object which appeared as a light which varied in intensity and changed color from red to green. The time of the sighting was approximately 6:30 hours CST to 7:30 hours CST. The object was traveling from the north to the south at an indicated airspeed of 370 knots at 7000 altitude. The object appeared to be off the left wing approximately one mile away. The reliability of the witness is excellent, and no identifications actions were taken as there were no other aircraft in the immediate vicinity.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED

1. Sources described the object as being a light which varied in intensity and appeared to change color from a white through red, amber and green. The object exhibited a pulsating or erratic population motion or other variant features.

2. The time of sighting was reported as 2030 CST. A person on the ground said the object was visible for almost one hour. The object appeared to ascend and descend or was visible for about 5 minutes at a time.  

3. Observation was from airborne C-47 flying at altitude of 7,000 ft. The pilot and copilot reported the sighting. They notified Vichy radio, who in turn called Scott AFB. Scott AFB asked them to continue to watch the object.

4. The observers were flying a C-47 aircraft in the vicinity of Vichy, Missouri, and were in contact with Vichy radio immediately after sighting.

5. The reliability and credence of this information cannot be accurately established. However, the former Intelligence officer of Scott Air Force Base, using a photograph, has suggested the image would appear in the position to the west-southwest as described.

6. Weather conditions at the time of sighting: Broken undercast at 2000 ft and winds varying to 25 knots.

7. The planes, when observed through a slight haze, appeared to be larger than normal.

8. No physical evidence of the sighting exists.

9. No interruption or identification action was taken. ADC radar stations tried to track the object but lost it as it was out of range.

10. Vichy radio reports no other traffic in their zone at the time of sighting.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed statement from Captain Robert R. Bailey regarding an incident involving an unusual object observed in the vicinity of Vichy, Missouri on April 17, 1952. The statement describes the pilot's observations, including the object's ability to change direction and speed, as well as its disappearance from view. The statement is signed by Captain Robert R. Bailey.

STATEMENT

The following statement is submitted in accordance with Paragraph 76a, AP 12-50 dated 22 April 1952.

I, Capt. Robert R. Bailey, the pilot of a C-47E, on a course of 135 degrees, reported an unusual object in the vicinity of the Vichy radio range station. While at an altitude which had previously been established at circular direction of 170 knots, heading 180 degrees, a light intensity appeared to be on a collision-intercept course from my plane. The light, which was preceded by very brilliant exhaust flame, took a circuitous course in approaching my airplane. When it reached a point off my left wing or at 12 o'clock, the light varied in intensity and color from red to green. The light remained visible for 5-10 minutes during which time it dropped back. Relative to the aircraft, then increased its speed and made a turn and passed on a course approximately 5 miles in front of my airplane. The Chief and a seaman passenger reported the light disappeared upward at a high angle to the previous course. I executed a CIRVIS in-flight report to the Vichy Radio Range Station.
