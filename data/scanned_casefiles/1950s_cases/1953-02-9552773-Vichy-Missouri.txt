Capt. Robert B. Bailey, AO-6771125, an ATRC staff pilot, saw an unidentified object which appeared as a light which varied in intensity and changed color from red through amber to green. The time of the sighting was approximately 2030 hours CST to 2130 hours CST. The sighting was near Vichy, Missouri, from a C-47 type aircraft near Vichy, Missouri. The aircraft, which was enroute from Webb Air Force Base to Scott Air Force Base, was traveling at an indicated airspeed of 170 knots at 7000'. The object appeared to be off the left wing approximately one mile away. The reliability of the witnesses is excellent, and experience level is high. No identification action was taken. The Vichy radio stated that there were no other aircraft in the immediate vicinity.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Scott Air Force Base, Illinois                 A726-6-53            PAGE    2 OF 2 PAGES

1. Sources described the object as being a light which varied in intensity and appeared to change color from white through red, amber and green, to changing, pulsating system or other pulsating features were observed.

2. The time of sighting was reported as 2030 CST. A seaman passenger said object was visible for almost one hour. Pilot, copilot and crew observed it for about 5 minutes before it disappeared.

3. Observation was from airborne C-47, flying at altitude of 4000 ft. on night of 28 Feb 53, near correction. Pilot was notified Vichy radio, who in turn called Scott AFB. Scott AFB asked ADF radar station to track, with negative results, as only the C-47 aircraft was observed.

4. The observers were flying a C-47 aircraft in the vicinity of Vichy, Missouri, and were in contact with Vichy radio immediately after sighting.

5. The reliability and experience of the witnesses cannot be underestimated. "However, the former intelligence officer of Scott Air Force Base, using a protractor and compass, established that the planet Venus would appear to be at the proper angle and elevation so as to appear in the position described with this sighting.

6. Weather conditions at the time of sighting: Broken undercast at 2000 ft., winds NE varying to 25 knots.

7. The planet Venus, observed through a slight haze, appeared as a brilliant light and the planet appeared much closer than normal.

8. No physical evidence of the sighting exists.

9. No interception or identification action was taken. ADF radar station did track area with only the C-47 aircraft on the scope at the time of search.

10. Vichy radio reports no other traffic in their zone at the time of sighting.

STATEMENT

The following statement is submitted in accordance with Paragraph 73, AF Letter 200-5 dated 29 April 1952.

I, Capt. Robert B. Bailey, the pilot of a C-47, on a course of 15 degrees, 7000' altitude and at an indicated airspeed of 170 knots, noticed an unusual object in the vicinity of the Vichy radio range station, which appeared a circular light which, from my position, appeared to be approximately one foot in diameter. The light of varying intensity appeared to be on a collision-interception course from approximately 23° degrees. I turned on my landing lights to warn the object of my presence and notified the co-pilot and new Chief of my sighting. They corroborated my observation and watched as the object appeared to position itself approximately one mile off the left wing or at 225 degrees. The light varied in intensity and color from red through amber to green. In remained visible for 5-10 minutes during which time it dropped back, relative to the aircraft, then increased its speed and made three dives and zooms on a course parallel to that of this aircraft before disappearing. The Crew Chief and a seaman passenger reported the light disappeared upward at a right angle to the previous course. I executed a CLEVIS in-flight report to the Vichy Radio Range Station.
