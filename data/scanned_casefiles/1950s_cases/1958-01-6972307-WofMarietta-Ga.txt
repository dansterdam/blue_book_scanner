DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE: OBJECT MAY POSSIBLY HACE BEEN RESEARCH
BALLON LAUNCHED FROM VERNALIS, CALIF. HOWEVER, SHORT DURATION OF
SIGHTING UNDER EXCELLENT WEATHER CONDITIONS WOULD PRTICALLY RULE
OUT BALLOON. COULD HAVE BEEN NON-PERSISTENT CONTRAIL FROM AIR-
CRAFT IN TURN. OBSERVER HIGHLY EXPERIENCED POLOT AND CONTROLLER
AND THEREFORE FAMILIAR WITH APPEARANCE OF CONTRAILS. HOWEVER, CONTRAIL
PATTERNS AT TIMES APPEAR VERY UNUSUAL EVEN TO EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS.
