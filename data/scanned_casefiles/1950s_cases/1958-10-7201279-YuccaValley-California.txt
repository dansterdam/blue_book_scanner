Dear Major Friend:

Mr. [REDACTED] personally visited the Pentagon on 25 October 1958 and left the enclosed roll of 8 mm film on unidentified flying objects for analysis and identification.

Please see what the film looks like and give me an opinion to forward with the film which I return it to Mr. [REDACTED].

SAFHI-3, Attn: Maj. L. J. Tucker
AFOIN-4h
19 December 1953

1. The ATIC had these portions of film containing the socalled "UFO" examined for detailed analysis. The examinants did not reveal any distinct contours of the object, as the film under a microscope did not provide sufficient detail for identification of the object.

2. The analysis of the film indicates the object was stationary, yet for details of the object's identity or characteristics, nothing definite can be concluded. It is the opinion of the ATIC that the obvious reason is photographs taken under existing conditions were not satisfactory.

3. The object was photographed for a total time of approximately six seconds. The determination of the running rate of the camera was not possible, and therefore the true speeds and altitudes of the object cannot be shown.

4. In view of the limited data available, the ATIC is unable to come to any definite conclusion as to what the object is. However, it is conceivable that no sufficient detail was available to the examinants for identification, and therefore it is considered that no further analysis would be possible.

FROM: AFOIN-4E COMMENT NO.: 1

1. The ATIC had these portions of Mr. - film containing the socalled UFO enlarged for detailed analysis. The enlargements did not reveal any additional detail which would aid in the proper identification of the phenomenon.

2. The analysis of the film indicates the object was stationary, yet Mr. -  film contained enough to get adequate photographs revealing certain details. It is in the opinion of the ATIC that the obvious reason the photo was not good is photographs taken in the dark at night and under poor visibility conditions.

3. The object was photographed for a total time of approximately six seconds. This was determined by counting the number of frames on which the object appeared and knowing the camera speed.

4. In view of the limited data available, the ATIC is unable to come to any definite conclusion as to what the object is. However, it appears to be a reflection of some sort. Knowing the reputation of Mr. - , it is conceivable that he photographed exactly what he saw.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text in the document is as follows:

5 January 1959

Dear Mr. _____,

I am re-turning herewith the film you submitted to the United States Air Force for evaluation which you thought contained an unidentified flying object.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center had these portions of the data containing the original unidentified flying objects enlarged. However, the enlargements did not reveal any more detail than did the observations of the projected image on the screen.

The analysis of the film indicates the object was stationary, and was photographed for a considerable length of time, approximately six minutes. This would indicate the object appeared and knowing the running rate of the camera used.

It is the opinion of the ATIC that this is a photograph of a reflection.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
