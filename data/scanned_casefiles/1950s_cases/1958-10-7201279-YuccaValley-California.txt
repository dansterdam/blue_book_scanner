1. The ATIC had those portions of film containing the so-called UFO enlarged for detailed analysis. The enlargements did not reveal any trend data and do not justify a conclusion of the project. image or imputation of the film under a microscope.

2. The analysis of the film indicates the object was stationary, yet Mr. _____ was not concerned enough to get closer photographs revealing creator detail. It is the opinion of the ATIC that the obvious reason is photographs taken closer would not have stood up under inspection.

3. The object was photographed for a total time of approximately six seconds from a frame on which the object appeared and known running rate of the camera.

4. In view of the limited data available, the ATIC is unable to come to any definite conclusion as to the object. However, an explanation is conceivable that Mr. __________ is conceivably that he arranged for this reflection, and/or knows exactly what was photographed.

DATE: 19 December 1958
COMMENT NO: 1

1. The ATIC had those portions of Mr. [name redacted] film containing the so-called UFO enlarge for detailed analysis. The enlargements did not reveal any more detail than did the observations of the projected image or inspection of the film under a microscope.

2. The analysis of the film indicates the object was stationary, yet Mr. [name redacted] was not concerned enough to get closer photographs revealing greater detail. It is the opinion of the ATIC that the obvious reason is photographs taken closer would not have stood up under inspection.

3. The object was photographed for a total time of approximately six seconds. This was determined by counting the frames on which the object appeared and knowing the running rate of the camera.

4. In view of the limited data available, the ATIC is unable to come to any definite conclusion as to what the object is. However, it appears to be a reflection of some sort. Knowing the reputation of Mr. [name redacted] and/or knowing exactly what was photographed, it is conceivable that he arranged for this reflection.

5 January 1959

Dear Mr. [redacted]

I am returning herewith the film you submitted to the United States Air Force for evaluation which you thought contained a photograph of an unidentified flying object.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center had those portions of the film containing the so-called unidentified flying object enlarged for detailed analysis. The enlargements did not reveal any more detail than did the observations of the projected image or inspection of the film under a microscope.

The analysis of the film indicates the object was stationary and was photographed for a total time of approximately six seconds. This is based upon counting the frames on which the object appeared and knowing the running rate of the camera used.

It is the opinion of the ATIC that this is a photograph of a reflection.

Sincerely,

/s/
