The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report on an unidentified phenomenon. The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a document titled "PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT" which provides an analysis of the phenomenon observed near Phoenix, Arizona in 1958-1959.

The text in the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED
PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 65-36
SUBJECT: ANALYSIS OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA
LOCATION: PHOENIX, ARIZONA, USA - SWITZERLAND
PHOTOGRAPHIC DATE: AUGUST 1958 - JULY 1959
ATTACHMENTS: Attached 2-35mm color slides and copies thereof
PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 65-81 from 7/Sgt. D. S. Moody, 1502/USAF, for the analysis of the unidentified objects visible and two blank and white photo prints.
ANALYSIS: The color slides of Highway 69, vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona, is a copy photograph from a color slide taken in Switzerland. The slide depicts a bright, luminous object in the upper right portion of the image, near the horizon. The bright object appears to be rectangular in shape, and somewhat larger than the surrounding landscape which contains rich growth of desert vegetation and little more than colorful and picturesque cloud formations. The bright object in the slide moves from right to left and leaves a diagonal line immediately below this mass. This diagonal line is probably due to poor photo processing.
The second slide is probably due to over-exposure in photography, although the format and shows a view of the typical mountainous terrain of Switzerland. The definition of the slide is not sharp, and considerable grain structure is visible, possibly due to the processing method.
No items of significance were observed on other slides.
