SUBJECT ANALYSIS OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA
LOCATION PHOENIX, ARIZONA USA - SWITZERLAND    DATE AUGUST 1958 - JULY 1959

PHOTOGRAPHY
P MISC Attached 2-35mm Color Slides and copies thereof    QUALITY

1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 65-84 from T/Sgt D. N. Moody, AFTAC/UFO, for an analysis of the attached two color slides and two black and white photo reproductions thereof.

2. ANALYSIS: The color slide of Highway 69, vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona is a copy probably from a picture in a magazine. It bears a registration copyright mark of a type used by professional photographers. The slides depicts the phenomena of a desert sunset and containing little more than a general and picturesque cloud formation. At the approximate midpoint of the slide is an orange, funnel-like mass which is probably a single, diagonal trail of cloud from the desert floor.

The second slide, taken in Switzerland, is also a copy, although the original source cannot be identified. The photograph is a low oblique possibly aerial in format and shows a view of the typical mountainous terrain of Switzerland. No significant definition and color rendition of the slide are at best only fair. Within the upper portion of the photograph is an elongated mass, which is probably due to a reflection from possibly a portion of the aircraft's surface from which the photograph was taken.

b. No items of significance were observed on either slide.
