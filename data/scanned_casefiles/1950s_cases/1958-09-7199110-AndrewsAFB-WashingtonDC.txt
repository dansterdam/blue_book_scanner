This appears to be a map or chart with a grid system and radial lines emanating from a point on the right side of the image. The map shows various geographical features and locations marked with small dots and text. The grid is composed of latitude and longitude lines, and the map seems to cover a large geographical area, possibly North America or part of the Northern Hemisphere. The details are quite small and intricate, with numerous annotations and markings across the map's surface.

- Various markings, numbers, and symbols across the map
- A radial grid pattern emanating from a point on the left side of the image
- Detailed gridded sections, particularly in the lower right portion of the map

The map seems to be a technical or navigational chart, possibly related to meteorological, astronomical, or geographical research. The image is in black and white and appears to be from an official document or report.

UFO is a Reflection
From Arc Welders

The "mysterious winged object" which two Army militiamen said landed and took off near their Nike site at Derwood, Md, last Wednesday has been identified by the Air Force.

"It wasn't mysterious," and while it was winged, it didn't land and take off, a spokesman for Andrews Air Force Base, which sent 1st Agitator and a helicopter for an on-the-spot probe of the report, stated.

It turned out to be a group of orange-colored Potomac Electric Power Co. trucks, early reflecting the unearthly glow of arc welders working to build PEPCO towers in the area, the Air Force said. It had ascertained.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for August 23, 1958

Mars Draws Near

The three planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, in addition to many first-magnitude stars, will be evident in the September evening sky.

JAMES STOKLEY

EARLY DRAWING closer to the red planet Mars is becoming increasingly conspicuous in the evening sky. By 7:30 P.M. Mars will be about 1,000 miles in the line of the moon's diameter above the horizon, and about 75%, reaching magnitude minus 1 the astronomical scale by Sept. 10.

A position of Mars, which is in the constellation of Taurus, the bull, is shown on accompanying maps. These depict the star positions usual 10 p.m., your own standard time (add one hour for daylight saving).

In the middle of the month, and two hours at the close, the red color of Mars will be brighter than at the first of the month. It is in fact brighter than any planet save Venus, and is even brighter. It is an observation that will make it easy to identify.

In the evening, however, Jupiter will be the first magnitude star seen, and is in the west. Of magnitude 4 of the month it will descend below the horizon and will not be able to see at all.

As shown in Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer constellation, a bright Mars, beginning of September, is low in the southwest. Of magnitude 4, the brightest is Venus, in Lyra, the eagle. In the west, a little in the east group you will see Cygnus, the swan, and in the star Deneb, Altair, in Aquila, the eagle. These bright stars, all of the first magnitude, that is sometimes called the summer evenings, will be conspicuous in the evenings.

Other first magnitude stars are also low in the northwest. All of them now quite low in where the increased atmospheric depth by the atmosphere causes them to appear fainter than they should.

In the northwest, to the left of Mars, I find Capella, in Auriga, the charioteer. In the northwest is Arcturus, in the bear (Ursa) Minor, and in the south Fomalhaut, in Piscis Austrinus.

Rising Planets

In early morning the planet Venus will be the first about an hour before the sun. At the first of September, an hour at the east ninth Venus will be nearly the innermost of all the planets, which will then be reaching the halfway point. It will then be standing directly over the equator, above a point a thousand miles south of Dakar, in French West Africa. In the Northern Hemisphere, this will occur during the early autumn, while spring is in the Northern Hemisphere of the Southern Hemisphere.

A few days after this the moon will be full, on Sept. 27. This will be the harvest moon. The peculiarity of this moon will be the difference in its appearance in moonrise for several nights in succession. In September, this reaches maximum for half an hour, compared to about an hour and a quarter in March. Bright moonlight for a number of nights in succession is expected to help the farmer to bring in his harvest.

Destination Lyra

Lyra, which shines high overhead these evenings, has a number of points of interest. The constellation contains the sun and all the planets. It is moving through space toward Lyra at a speed of about 12 miles per second. The earth's distance to Lyra is about 186,000 miles each second, which is a measure of more than 20 miles per second. It is the earth approaching Lyra, itself moving about 83 miles per second.

[The document also contains two star charts/maps showing planetary and star positions, but as per instructions, I have not described these charts.]
