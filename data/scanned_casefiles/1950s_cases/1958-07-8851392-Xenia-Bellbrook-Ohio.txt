MEMO FOR CASE FILE - 15 July 1958, Xenia, Ohio

SUBJECT: Telephone Interview of Source - Mrs. [redacted]

1. After two days of attempting to contact this person, reached at 10:30 A.M. this date.

2. After explaining that we cannot do much with only a report of some lights seen in the general vicinity of Xenia, without specific information as to direction, bearings, locations, altitudes, etc., Mrs. [redacted] gave the following additional data:

a. Object in sight from about 4:30 to 5:30 A.M.

b. Was not sure of direction but believed to be East Northeast. (Astro computers and tables show Venus rising out of the Northeast (118 degrees) at that time. WX conditions such that it appeared highly magnified.

c. Object looked like a very bright star - often appeared as three lights.

d. There were clouds in the area during the last half of the sighting and light faded out when clouds moved in front of it.

3. She asked if anyone else reported it. Replied that nothing unusual reported by local reader, flight in the air (B-47), COC or other persons.

4. Checks and analysis: As object was reported in same position for one hour - Astro check made. See Par. 2.b. above.
