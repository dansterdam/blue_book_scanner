IR-135-52
Headquarters, 206th FIGHTER-BOMBER WING (ADC)
Fort Wayne Municipal Airport, Indiana
13 September 1952
It is desired to inform you of the following unusual sighting that occurred.
1. Location and time of sighting - a sighting of an unusual nature was made from 20 to 25 minutes extending from approximately 7:00 to 7:25 p.m. on the evening of 12 September 1952.
2. Weather conditions - the weather was clear and calm with only scattered high cirro-cumulus clouds at about 30,000 feet altitude. 
3. Description of sighting - A bright light was observed traveling in a straight line from about 230° to about 330° at an estimated altitude of 50,000 to 60,000 feet. This light was observed to change color from a brilliant white to reddish-orange and then back to white again. No trail or exhaust was observed. The light was observed to increase in intensity and then fade out. The course was straight and level with no observable change in altitude.
4. This reporting officer is of the opinion that this is an instance of the reflection of the setting sun on some high altitude aircraft.

(UNGL) Report of Unusual Aerial Phenomena
31 December 1952
JOSEPH A. WOODS, Ist Lt Col USAF, Asst ADO
Prof. G. B. Sias

1. On 28 August 1952 an unusual aerial phenomenon was witnessed by Prof. G. B. Sias at Sassari, Sardinia.
2. Prof. G. B. Sias was interviewed by this officer and he appeared to be an intelligent and experienced observer. He stated that either (1) The United States has made scientific strides unknown to the rest of the world and this particular phenomenon was one of them, or (2) The phenomenon was of extraterrestrial origin. Prof. Sias appeared to be a very intense individual and while not actually convinced of the existence of what he thought he saw, he was obviously disturbed by the professor of what he thought he saw.

REPORT AND ILLUSTRATION OF A FLYING SPHERE

Observation by Prof. * * * * * *
TO THE UNITED STATES AIR ATTACHE AT ROME, ITALY

APPARITION OF A FLYING SPHERE

On the 28th of August 1952, the following article of mine was published in the largest daily newspaper of Milan (Corriere Della Sera):
Westerly passing, 27th of August, at 21:15 hours, I was walking as usual along the Corso Buenos Aires, towards the Piazza Cavour, when suddenly my attention was attracted by a bright-red luminous body in the sky, over the direction of Corso Venezia. I stopped and observed that it was a flying sphere which, after a few seconds, raced at a tremendous speed and disappeared behind the buildings. The light was steadier and larger than a star, and remained visible for about three minutes. Suddenly my attention was attracted by a transparent small cloud, circular in shape, which moved quickly and silently through the sky, leaving no trail. The cloud had an extraordinary brightness and luminosity which seemed to depart from the milky way. It increased rapidly in size and seemed to approach my position with a rotational movement. The cloud soon disappeared in the western part of the sky. As I stood still watching, I suddenly observed another luminous body, similar to the first one, which raced perpendicularly from the west to the east, at the same tremendous speed and disappearing again behind the buildings. I estimated the speed of the first sphere at approx. 1000 kph. The second sphere showed the same luminous characteristics, but seemed smaller in size. After a few seconds it too disappeared in the same manner as the first one. The two objects seemed to come from different directions but their rapid movements and the brevity of their apparitions defied precise observation. They were high-speed prodigy-like apparitions, which, however, must be considered as real facts, even though their origin and nature remain unexplained.

MAY FIRST IDEA WAS THAT SUCH A PHENOMENON WAS DUE TO A VERY PRECISE TECHNICAL DEVICE, CONTROLLED BY A HUMAN INTELLIGENCE, COMING FROM ABOVE AND DISAPPEARING IN THE SKIES IN AN ASTOUNDING MANNER, COMPLETELY MYSTERIOUS. LATER ON, HOWEVER, I WAS INCLINED TO ADMIT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MAY APPEAR WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTS BEING CONDUCTED ON UPPER ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA, IN COURSE OF WHICH EXTRAORDINARY APPARITIONS COULD BE CAUSED, EVEN IF CARRIED OUT AT VERY HIGH ALTITUDES, FOR EXAMPLE 50 OR 60 KILOMETERS ABOVE THE EARTH'S SURFACE (?). ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THESE PHENOMENA WERE ALREADY KNOWN TO CERTAIN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES, MIGHT IT NOT BE WORTHWHILE TO INVESTIGATE THEM FURTHER, IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THEIR TRUE ORIGIN AND NATURE. WOULD IT NOT BE USEFUL THAT MEN OF SCIENCE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION, IN AN IMPARTIAL AND SERIOUS MANNER, THESE OBSERVATIONS, WHICH SEEM TO BE REAL FACTS AND NOT EFFECTS OF IMAGINATION OR OPTICAL ILLUSIONS.

There is no doubt that these may be a more optical illusion as dissiped by the testimony of numerous persons who observed the phenomenon at the same time as myself. I personally regard these high-speed apparitions as real facts and am convinced they represent a highly interesting and worthwhile subject for scientific investigation, in order to ascertain their true origin and nature.

(2) the disappearance of this object at 2:15 hours

(5) the evening diameter.

The image also includes a written report with details about the observed UFO sighting, including the estimated geographical coordinates of the location, the altitude and dimensions of the object, and various observations about its behavior and characteristics.

THE MYSTERY OF TH. LINE AND SPHERE SHAPED LUMINOSITY

I must categorically affirm that the sighting of the sphere on my part was not an hallucination, nor merely the result of an attempt to explain such a phenomenon. However, the description of the object which I gave in my first communication through Ambassador Clare Boothe Luce may not have been entirely accurate, since the phenomenon was so strange and the conditions of observation were far from ideal.

The dimensions were not as I first stated. As a matter of fact, the diameter of the sphere or circle was something over 10 meters. Its color was a peculiar bluish-white and the shape itself was not perfectly spherical, but somewhat elongated, suggesting a figure eight in outline. The duration of the observation was approximately 1/4 of an hour.

The most puzzling aspect of the phenomenon was the appearance of the line or lines, which were clearly visible and which seemingly emanated from the sphere. These lines were not straight, but consisted of a series of undulating curves, varying in length and thickness. Some of the lines emanated from the sphere, others seemed to converge upon it. The direction of the lines was downward.

PERSONAL REMARKS:

(1) I must categorically affirm that the vision of the sphere on my part was not casual or passing, but constituted a genuine psychical experience. I consider myself a fairly level-headed person, not inclined toward mysticism or the supernatural, and I was under no emotional stress or excitement at the time. 

(2) I am at a loss to explain this phenomenon, which cannot even be compared with the brightness of a falling star or any known atmospheric phenomenon. All my efforts to find a rational explanation have failed. The lines were not luminous except when observed in conjunction with the sphere. A new, heavier light?

(3) I believe that the privilege was not entirely intended for me: the phenomenon appeared to be intended for the orphans of the Salesian Institute, the custodians of the site. This leads me to think that the phenomenon may have had some cosmic or religious significance.

The basic scientific data are here below briefly summarized:

(1) the geography: the sighting took place in an open field near the Salesian Institute at the outskirts of Rome
(2) the dimension and heavenly-light: the measuring system of such apparitions yields 10 meters for the diameter
(3) the earth's curvature: the measuring system indicates a height of 2400 meters, which corresponds to the observations
(4) the light: a peculiar whitish-blue color unlike the usual celestial illumination, with the lines not luminous except in conjunction with the sphere
(5) the duration: approximately 1/4 of an hour
(6) to the author: a clear intent to transfer the secret and the property of this writing of mine to the Air Force.
