Marines Seeking Flying Saucers Find New Aviation Light
By Jack James
Short Staff Correspondent

QUANTICO, VA., Jan. 5.—The Marines looked for flying saucers last night, and saw weather balloons, airplane lights and stars. Intelligence officers, armed with high-powered night binoculars, scanned the skies above the Marines base for three hours.

They were there because for the past five nights sentries reported seeing strange lights in the sky.

The verdict: The sentries had indeed seen something strange to them, but it was merely recently installed powerful searchlights or commercial aircraft.

Today, the sentries were to be briefed on this latest development in night flying.

At Greensville, Pa., a sentry on duty at the Tank Park in Camp Barnes, spotted the oddity first. That was on December 30 at 9:05 p.m. It looked like a big, flashing red light. "The next morning," he said, "I would have thought it was an airplane, but I couldn't hear any motor noise."

He called for Sgt. Francis R. Salinder, the sergeant of the guard, and together they watched the light.

"It looked like a big red light to me," Sgt. Salinder said.

The next three nights, Pvts. Harrison J. Bennett, another sentry, saw the strange objects. Oddly, he saw them first at the same hour, 9:05 p.m.

Thursday night, one traveled toward the southwest, and the other was stationary.

"They seemed to hover together for a while," he said. "Then one disappeared, and the other moved away from the spot."

At 6:40 p.m. Friday, Pvt. Bennett first saw them again. The same thing happened Saturday night at 7 p.m. and 7:15 p.m.

Then Sunday night, Sgt. Harlan Young saw them at 6:40 p.m. and 7:20 p.m. "They seemed to be about 2,000 feet high," he said.

The verdict: The sentries had indeed seen something strange to them, but it was merely recently installed powerful anti-collision lights on commercial aircraft.

Friday, the sentries were to be briefed on the latest developments in night flying.

Ft. Norman Vise of Green-ville, Pa., a sentry on duty at the Tank Park in Camp Barrett, a few miles from the main base, reported the first incident on December 30 at 9:05 p.m.

"I looked like a big, flashing red light," Pfc. Vise said. "I would have thought it was an airplane, but I heard no motor noise."

He Called for Sgt. Francis R. Blinder, the sergeant of the guard, and together they watched the lights.

"It looked just like a big red light to me," Sgt. Blinder said.

The next three nights, Pfc. Harrison J. Bennett, another sentry, saw the strange objects, and, oddly, he saw them first at 6:40 p.m. each night.

Pfc. Bennett saw two lights traveling night. One traveled toward the southwest, and the other toward the northeast.

"I watched them together for a while," he said. "Then one disappeared, and the other moved around and finally disappeared."

At 6:40 p.m. Friday, Pfc. Bennett saw them again. The same thing happened Saturday night, then Sunday night, Sgt. Harrison Young saw them at 6:40 p.m.

"They seemed to be about 2,000 yards in the sky, and pretty high."

And so last night, Maj. John Shearer, of the intelligence unit, and Maj. D. D. Pomerlea, the provost marshal, were on hand.

At 6:40, some one said positively, "There it is."

The next moment, Maj. Pomerlea, reporters and photographers in a rush caught the red lights, which followed in the sky toward the southeast, near the horizon. Maj. Shearer trained his binoculars.

"I can see something," he said. "It looks a little like a balloon."

And still later: "Now I can see his navigational lights, too."

See Weather Balloons.

At 7:45 p.m. there was another shout from outside. Maj. Shearer went to work with his glasses to gain more light. Some one suggested it might be a balloon, almost directly upward.

"Weather balloon," Maj. Shearer said.

A few minutes later, some one spotted another blinking light, a star.

At 8:15 p.m. the shout went up again.

The flashing red light this time moved on an orderly course from the northeast toward the southeast, just above the horizon, and was visible. The navigational lights also were visible.

Maj. Shearer did some telephoning to the Civil Aeronautics Administration and asked for more information about the light.

A report is being installed on commercial aircraft passenger needs of higher speeds. The light, known as a 60,000 candle power light, can be seen at a greater distance by other pilots.

1 JANUARY 1954, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

From the air base at Quantico, Virginia, on the nights of 1 and 2 January 1954, several military and civilian personnel reported seeing an unidentified flying object pass over the area. The object was described as a flashing red light, dome shaped and appearing to be the size of a grapefruit at arms length. The object flew a relatively straight course and was visible for 5 or 6 minutes.

An aircraft was scrambled in an attempt to pursue the light. The aircraft intercepted an American Air Lines' Convair. In addition to the intercept, an ATIC officer proceeded to Quantico and observed this same light from the ground.

The reported light was definitely identified as being a Grimes Beacon light. These have recently been installed on several civilian passenger aircraft.

Marines Chase
Flying Object
With 'Copter
Two Sentries Report
Seeing Mystery Craft
In Sky Near Quantico

One of those mysterious flying
objects reportedly landed near
Quantico on New Year's Eve but
was off again before the Ma-
rines could get the situation in
hand.

A spokesman yesterday confirmed that a flying object had
been reported near the base
about 15 miles from Quantico.
Two sentries in a helicopter
patrol, a Marine stationed
about 15 miles from Quantico,
reported seeing an object in
the sky and described it as a
flying saucer, according to the
spokesman. They notified the
Officer of the Day that it had
landed, and the helicopter took
off from Quantico. By the time
it arrived, the mystery ship had
risen and was out of sight.

The news spread swiftly
among Quantico personnel. One
news source said that two platoons
were deployed to capture the
object, but this was denied by the
official spokesman.

Statements were taken from
the two sentries, and the spokesman said the investigation was
now in the hands of "higher
authorities."

The two sentries were reported off the base on pass last
night and the Marine spokesman was not able to supply their
description of the objects, or
their report of its actions.

The spokesman reported they
had been summoned to appear
before high officers of the Marine Base this morning for additional statements.

N.Y.H.T. Dec. 18, 1953

Yeager said the B-29 is used to take the small plane to high altitude for speed test.

Maj. Yeager said the B-29 climbed to Xla at 30,000 feet. "I fired off three of the four 45,000 feet and burned on the fourth chamber," he related. "I climbed in sort of an arc, leveled off at about 70,000 feet and shut it off." He had attained his maximum speed an instant before he shut off the power.

Asked about the visibility from the cockpit, he said: "Excellent. In fact, too good. When you can look back and see the shock waves on your wing you'd rather not see them." He explained the shock wave from the terrifically high speed shows as a line in the air somewhat like that from the wake of a ship in water.

Maj. Charles E. Yeager telling Lawrence D. Bell, president of Bell Aircraft, how it feels to fly more than 1,600 miles an hour. Maj. Yeager, whose record flight was disclosed yesterday, is holding a model of the plane which set the record, the Bell X1A. The picture was taken at Maj. Yeager's news conference in the Pentagon yesterday.

Pilot Tells Of Flight at 1,600 M.P.H.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 (JP) - Maj. Charles E. Yeager today how it feels to fly faster than any man has flown before and predicted his speed of two and a half times the speed of sound will be exceeded shortly.

"Physically," he said, "Your ears don't drop off or anything." Actually, you wouldn't know how fast you are going unless you look at your mach instrument. "This instrument measures speed in relation to sound.

But the young Air Force officer said, "It wasn't a scary ride . . . I was quite busy but did get a little hot on the skin of the plane out the airplane is built for that."

Tells of Flight
Maj. Yeager held a joint news conference with Lawrence D. Bell, president of Bell Aircraft Corp., to tell something about his flight on Saturday in the rocket-driven Bell X1A plane.

Maj. Yeager didn't go into the effects on the plane, but Mr. Bell indicated it went through some violent shocks in the speed burst more than 70,000 feet. Above Edwards Air Force Base.

The Air Force announced yesterday that Maj. Yeager flew more than 1,600 miles an hour but did not disclose his exact speed. The old mark of 1,327 miles an hour was set Nov. 20 by a Navy Skyrocket.

Predicting still greater speed, Maj. Yeager said the X1 research plane will be flying "shortly" and is expected "to shove the speed up a little higher." "The X1 has a skin of stainless steel to help resist the softening effect of heat from air friction at tremendous speeds. The X1A burns up its fuel supply in one or one-half minute after it is dropped from the belly of a B-29, Maj.

1. While on a trip to the Director of Intelligence in connection with Project 60006, Maj G. R. Glassbrook was requested by Lt Col Smith in Gen Samford's Office to proceed to Quantico Marine Base to investigate the report of flying saucers.

2. Photographic equipment was procured through Lt Col Thacker, Air Attache Branch, and the control tower at Bolling Air Force Base. His instructions were to evaluate the phenomena and if it was something explainable to give that to the Marines to relay to the press and if something that could not be contributed to natural causes, the Marines were to be given a copy of the written report at a later date.

3. Maj Glassbrook proceeded to Quantico at 1800 hours arriving at 1900 hours going to the Tank Park in the Guadalcanal Area and reporting to Maj Ferguson, Marine PIO. Maj Ferguson briefed him on the happenings of the past three nights.

At 1945 hours a Marine corporal reported that the phenomena was appearing again, Maj Glassbrook and Maj Ferguson went outside and observed a flashing light which appeared in the north and passed over the northeast section of the Danger Area in a southeasterly direction. It was readily apparent that this was the Grimes Beacon on a commercial air liner as Maj Glassbrook could see both wing tip identification lights at one time, in addition to the Grimes Beacon. This information was given to Maj Ferguson and, at a later time, released to the press.

4. Attached is a copy of the press release which appeared in the 5 January 1954 edition of the Evening Star.

5. This information was relayed to Gen Samford's Office upon Maj Glassbrook's return to the Washington Area.
