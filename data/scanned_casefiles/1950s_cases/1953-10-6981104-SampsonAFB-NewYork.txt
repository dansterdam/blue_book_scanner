Object was possibly an A/C and the description is conjectural.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Circular and round 36 silvery colored object which had a wobble and moved in a zigzag pattern. Observers ran to get a better view. However, when they got out of the house, the object was gone. They could see the object was round, no vapor trail, no sound, and changed shape. Daughter (age 9) saw a disc shaped object.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PLYO/JRPT
AREA REFERENCE NO: Sampson AFB Head, SATB, Geneva, N. Y.

DATE OF REPORT: 12 October 1953

PREPARED BY: (Orgn) EARL E. LA CLAIR, Major, USAF

PREVIOUS REPORT: Electrical Message G 126

FROM: (Agency) Wing Intelligence

DATE: 9 October 1953

SUMMARY: (This report contains information of the sighting, and hearing of a bright, silver object from Sampson AFB Hospital, Geneva, N.Y. at 1120 and 1143 hours, 9 October 1953.

2. INFO: Sampson AFB Hospital reported first by telephone then by letter form the visual observation and the hearing of a bright, silvery object, as seen by witness, the object resembled in size a tea-cup, three (3) inches in diameter, as one looks into it. The object appeared to be or could be a uniform outline and appeared to be traveling on its edge. It traveled through the sky from NE to SW at an altitude estimated to be between 10,000 and 12,000 feet. The speed of the object, as described by the observer, seemed to be between that of a propeller-driven and a jet aircraft, the observer seemed to linger over the area where observed. The observer told of watching the object for approximately one (1) minute or so, then her running to her neighbor's quarters to inform her. When both the observer and her neighbor returned outside to look, the object could not be located; but the sound, which was described as a great, unbroken and continuous, seemed so loud as before for approximately another two (2) or more minutes.

3. The second witness, 9 year-old [REDACTED], was reported to have hastened to her mother, was noted in her account of seeing an object similar to that observed by first witness. The only difference noted by the first witness was the size, which this child described as being that of a silver dollar. The sound was the object was similar in description and volume. No estimate of altitude.

4. Further investigation revealed little more, except that from the description of the first observer the object traveled at an altitude of approximately 11,000 feet, the object traveled in a straight-line course. There were no maneuvers observed. The observation was made at an angle of approximately 45 degrees from the point of observation.

5. A check of weather conditions revealed:
2000-250 degrees at 06K
4000-260 degrees at 05K
6000-250 degrees at 10K
8000-300 degrees at 12K
12000-270 degrees at 12K
12000-240 degrees at 21K

6. Further details concerning above information were unknown to sources.

Previous Report: Electrical Message G 426

1. This report contains information of the sighting and hearing of a bright silver object from Sampson AFB Hospital, Geneva, N.Y. on 112N and 1153 hours, 9 October 1953.

2. Mrs [redacted], Sampson AFB Hospital, reported first by telephone then by letter form the visual observation and the hearing of a bright silvery object. As seen by Mrs [redacted], the object resembled in size a tea-cup, three (3) inches in diameter, as one looks into it. The object appeared to be completely uniform in outline and appeared to be traveling on its edge. It traveled through the sky from NE to SW at an altitude estimated to be between 10,000 and 12,000 feet. The speed of the object, as described by the observer, seemed to be between that of a propeller-driven and a jet aircraft; the object seemed to linger over the area where observed. The observer told of watching the object for approximately one (1) minute or so, then of running to her neighbor's quarters to summon her. When both the observer and her neighbor returned outside to look, the object could not be located; but the sound, which was described as a growl, unknown and constant, seemed to continue as loudly as before for approximately another two (2) or more minutes.

3. The second witness, 9 year-old [redacted], was reported to have hastened to her mother, Mrs [redacted], and told her of seeing an object similar to that observed by Mrs [redacted]. This second observation was reported to have been made at 1143. The only difference noted by the first witness was the size, which the child described as being that of a silver dollar. The sound of the object was similar in description and volume. No estimate of altitude.

4. Further investigation revealed little more, except that from the description of the first observer the object traveled at an altitude of approximately 11,000 feet. There were no maneuvers observed. The observation was made at an angle of approximately 45 degrees from the point of observation.

Re: Unusual Round Aircraft

Dear Sir:

At approximately 11:15 this morning I was hanging out clothes in the wooded area behind our quarters, when I became conscious of an unusual, loud roaring noise. I looked toward the direction of the sound, the northeast and in a moment saw a silvery object. This was traveling high in a westerly direction, seemingly over the main base.

Suddenly to my amazement the object seemed to be a silvery circular disk traveling on its edge. My thought was "Flying Saucer" and I ran to get my neighbor, Mrs. so that she too might observe the unusual sound. With her brother, we hastened to the clear area west of their quarters, but could see nothing, only the continuation of the roar. It was deafening in its pitch and my ears ached for almost an hour afterward. I have never heard anything like it. It wasn't like jets which hit a crescendo and are gone or the drone of other airplanes with a slight break, but a constant, monotonous sound. I noticed no vapor streaks as from jets.

I would guess that I actually saw the object about 11:20 and that with the others heard the roar for five minutes as we discussed "saucers" and the sound. Then I deliberated very seriously before calling in the information. If it had been only the appearance, I would have discounted what I saw, but coupled with the sound which two others thought unusual, I reported the craft. The operator connected the line with Captain Haley at Seneca Ordnance as he was the one to report to.

At 11:42 our daughter who is almost nine, came dashing in to tell me she had seen a flat silvery object, traveling from the southwest over the hospital, making a funny noise. She thought it had "smoke going in front of it". She had not heard me talking to her Captain Haley or Captain Haley, but she had been out playing with our sixteen months old son. From the size she showed with her hands, the object had looked to her about the size of a silvery dollar, while to me it had seemed more the size of a teacup, rather than the size of a saucer to use the popular terms. Captain Haley called me back to tell me a single jet was circling Ordnance.

By 1:30 I heard other aircraft in the area, but the sound was completely different. Several times I went out, but could never see any. For this reason I feel the strange craft was MUCH LARGER and MUCH HIGHER than any of these and produced a much greater noise.

The day was haze, very slight breeze, warm enough to be out without a sweater or coat. There were white clouds in streaky layers.

I can best describe the altitude in terms of a clock. Standing at the five, and looking between the ten and eleven, the object was about three inches in diameter. I could see the entire circular edge, with the silvery streak brightest up and down thru the center but nothing which changed the circular shape. It was seemingly still for the few seconds while I stared at it for I saw it so very distinctly.

Yet it was gone so quickly from sight though not from hearing.

I have been one of those skeptics who laughed about "Flying Saucers". Yesterday I heard them discussed and my thought was not to discover a "Flying Saucer", but to identify aircraft. For my own satisfaction, in almost ten years working on newspapers, I have never had such a terrifying or awe-inspiring experience. I am glad two other persons heard it that I know and I hope there are others who saw it to substantiate my report.

Very truly,
