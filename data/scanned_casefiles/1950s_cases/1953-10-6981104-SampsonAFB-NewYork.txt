AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO.: FTD-53-4/l REPORT SERIAL NO.: 6981104
DATE: 9 October 1953
ORGANIZATION: Sampson AFB, Geneva, N.Y.
LOCATION: Sampson AFB, Geneva, N.Y. 
DATE-TIME GROUP: 7 October 1953
WITNESS(ES): Capt. J.M. GILLIS, U.S.A.F.
SUMMARY (General Observations and Analysis): 
This report contains information of the observation of a bright silver object from Sampson AFB Hospital, Geneva, N.Y. at 1123 and 1143 hours, 7 October 1953.
The first witness, Capt. J.M. GILLIS, U.S.A.F., reported first by telephone that the object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and was visible for approximately 20-25 seconds. Captain GILLIS could not estimate the altitude or size of the object, but described it as being bright silver in color and appearing to be cigar-shaped. He stated the object was moving in a level flight path and appeared to be traveling in a straight line. Captain GILLIS stated the object seemed to disappear rather than land or take off.
The second witness, a young girl, was reported to have observed the object and stated that it appeared to be much larger than a jet aircraft and had a spinning motion. No estimate of altitude or speed was given.
A check of weather conditions revealed the following:
1030-1130 degrees 20 at 08K
1200-1300 degrees 24 at 10K
1300-1400 degrees 25 at 12K
1400-1500 degrees 26 at 20K

Further details concerning above information were unknown to source.

Previous Report: Electrical Message G 426

1. This report contains information of the sighting and hearing of a bright silvery-like object that appeared at 1128 and 1132 hours, 9 October 1953.

2. Mrs. _______ reported the visual observation of the object over the Sampson AFB Hospital, reported first by telephone then by later observation. The object appeared to be of a bright (3) inch diameter, circular in shape, somewhat elliptical, as one looks into it. The object appeared to be of a completely uniform outline, as one looks into it. The object appeared to be at an altitude estimated to be between 10,000 and 12,000 feet. The object moved in a westerly direction and was observed for approximately one (1) minute or so, then it disappeared from view. When both the observer and neighbor looked, the object could not be located; but the sound, which was described to be somewhat like a rushing sound, continued to be audible as before for approximately two (2) or more minutes.

3. Mrs. _________, witness, reported to have hastened to her mother, Mrs. _________ and told her of seeing an object similar to that described above. This second observation was reported to have been made at approximately the same time, but the object was not observed by the mother after being informed of it.

4. Further investigation revealed little more, except that from the description the object traveled at an estimated altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The object revealed in the daylight maneuvers at an approximate altitude of 10,000 feet. The object moved in a westerly direction and was observed for approximately one (1) minute or so.

5. Other weather conditions revealed:
2000-2300 degrees at 08K
4000-5000 degrees at 09K
6000-250 degrees at 10K
8000-300 degrees at 12K
10000-270 degrees at 12K
12000-240 degrees at 21K

Re: Unusual Round Aircraft

Dear Sir: 

At approximately 11:15 this morning I was hanging out clothes in the wooden area behind our quarters, when I became conscious of an unusual, loud roaring noise. I looked toward the direction of the sound, the propellant and it is a moment saw a silvery object. This was traveling high in a westerly direction, seemingly over the main base.

Suddenly its motion changed to a fact. It moved to the other side of the dusk, traveling on its edge. My thought was "Flying Saucer" and then to see nearer to observe it and hear the unusual sound. With her brother, we hastened to the shelter house of the Quartets, but could see nothing, only the continuation of the roar. It was deafening in its pitch and my ears continue ringing for some time. I have never heard anything like it before. It seemed to me to be a sort of hovering or the drone of other airplanes with a slight break, but a constant, monotonous sound. I noticed no vapor streaks as from jets.

I would guess that I actually saw the object about 11:20 and that with the other brother seen the same thing for five minutes as we discussed "saucers" and the sound. Then I deliberated very seriously before calling in the information. If it had been only the appearance, I would have discounted what I saw, but coupled with the sound which was so different from anything I had ever experienced, I reported it through our channels from the one to Captain Wiley at Seneca Ordnance as he was the one to give the report.

At 11:42 our daughter, who is almost nine, came dashing in to tell me she had seen a flat, silvery object traveling from the southwest over the hospital, making a funny noise. She thought it had maneuvered making a complete circle and had not been able to get a good look at it because of the speed. From the size she showed with her hands, the object had looked to her about the size of a silver dollar, while to me it had seemed much the size of a bowl of a teacup, rather than the size of a saucer to the principal to call me back to tell me a single jet was circling Ordnance.

UNCLASSIFIED
BY 1130 I head other aircraft in the area, but the sound was 
completely different. Several times I were out, but could never 
see any. For this reason I feel the strange craft was MUCH LARGER
AND MUCH HIGHER THAN ANY OF THESE AND PRODUCED A MUCH GREATER NOISE.

The day was hazy, very slight breeze, warm enough to be out without
a sweater or coat. The craft was white while visible in steady layers.

I can best describe the altitude in terms of 6 clock.  Standing at
the center, and looking between the ten and eleven, the object was
about three inches in diameter.  I could see the entire circular
edge, with the silvery spokes brightening up and down thru the center,
but nothing which changed the circular shape.  It was seeming ly still
for the two seconds during which I observed it, but it was very distinctly.
Yet it was gone so quickly from sight though not so very far off.  

I have been one of those specialists who laughed about "Flying Saucers".
Yesterday I heard them discussed and my thought was not to discover
a "Flying Saucer", but to identify aircraft for my own satisfactio n.
In almost ten years working on newspapers, I have not had such 
an exciting or unsuspecting experience.  I know just how incredible
it must appear, but please accept it as true, and I hope there are others
who saw it to substantiate my report.

Very truly,
