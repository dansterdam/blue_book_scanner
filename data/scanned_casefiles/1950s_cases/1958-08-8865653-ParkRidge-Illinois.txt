Dear Captain Dietz:

This letter contains a description of a phenomenon which my wife and I watched on the evening of August 26, 1958, between the hours of 9:58 P.M. and 10:05 P.M. The weather was clear, visibility unlimited and a full moon was out.

Standing outside, I notice a strange light in the sky at approximately 45° (see Figure 2 to the west. Thinking it was a -man-made moon, I ran inside to get my binoculars, and at the same time I told my wife to come out and see it. When I did focus my binoculars on the UFO, it was passing in front of the moon. (This is when I judged the size. See Figure 1) The forward section was cigar-shaped, while the rear looked like a jet stream. At no time did either one of us hear any noise from the UFO. My wife picked out the colors to be red, white, and orange. The total brightness in proportion to the moon was about 1 times as bright. At approximately 60° to the east the UFO disappeared. The total time of travel across the sky was approximately 3 minutes minus. The location where this UFO was sighted was at my home at 17365 So. Oconto, Tinley Park, Illinois.

I work as an engineer for the Chicago Midway Laboratories of The University of Chicago.
