The same position as regards:

26/9G61 - Dividend called and asked if we had any more information.
(269 also called).

26/9G62 - With T. called for information a strange flash from Glenwood, N.S.

26/9G62 - Called to [redacted] for more information.

26/9G63 - Dividend called inquiring about new reliable Mr. [redacted]
- CWP also asks the same query.

The Detachment Commander made several calls to Mr. [redacted] for additional information on the cyclical sighting and also to obtain some of his personal past history. [redacted] was recently been released from the RCAF after serving for a period of two years as a General Duties airman. From his record, it appears that his telephone and his past service experience, a certain amount of credulity was attended to his observation, and 14 Feb 62 he was a deserter either from the air or by a ground party - not to be advisable.

Since 72 RCMP had received no enquiries from 64th Intelligence at this reported sighting, the Detachment Commander telephoned "Major Theater" at 25/2592. Major Theater was not aware of the sighting and requested all information. We agreed that a trip was possible and that a party consisting of RCMP and [redacted] would go in early in the morning.

At 26/1202H it was learned that a party consisting of RCMP and Provost personnel had gone to Glenwood during the night and questioned [redacted] to search had been made. Heather prevented the RCMP party from their trip on this date.

At the request of Lt. Cooper, 64th Intelligence, the RCMP party went out on the ground search at 27/1202. The party left Glenwood at 0152 and returned at 2302 without any success. [redacted] was unable to lead the party to the clearing he claimed he found on 14 Feb 62.

The Detachment Commander telephoned two officials of Bowaters woods department, Glenwood, who were known for their reaction to the incident. [redacted] was interviewed and gave a brief account of the incident. During the search, [redacted] made several enquiries of the locals as to whether this incident would receive any publicity. This was an indication that the incident would probably not occupy any publicity unless 64th Air DIV wished it so.

[redacted] was not available for interview, but her daughter was questioned regarding the sighting at 26/9G62. The daughter stated that the object seen as a red light in the west sky/clouds. It was seen in the vicinity of the Trans Canada Highway. It can very well be that this light was from the snow sights clearing the woods after the snowfall. In the past they had similar sightings.

[Note: Some names and specific details are blacked out in the original document]

Mrs. [blacked out] of Glenwood had seen a red streak in the sky part of Glenwood at 12:00 midnight.

Mrs. [blacked out] was not available for interview, but her daughter, [blacked out] was questioned concerning their sighting. She described the object as a red light to the west traveling toward [blacked out]. A check disclosed the light was seen in the vicinity of the Trans-Canada Highway.

There was a snowplow clearing the roads after two days of heavy snowfall, and it is very possible this is what they saw.

While investigating [blacked out] sighting, a call came in from Flight Officer Miller, Dep. Controller of the 2nd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Mt. Gander, NF, who said they saw an object on their radar screen 8 years ago. They scanned from the scope to the west and they were unable to see anything in the area. Upon further questioning, Flight Officer Miller revealed that, in his opinion, this object was celestial, a bright star which appeared to change colors due to the specific conditions at the time.

At 12:40 A.M., 25 February 1958, a call was received from Mr. [redacted] at Glenwood, Newfoundland. He reported the sighting of a disc like object falling from the sky and on fire.

Later during the day Mr. [redacted] called and stated he had visited the area where the object had touched landed and found a clearing 1/4 mile by 1000 ft, trees freshly broken and uprooted, and snow was cleared away in a perfect triangle. The snow was depressed and plowed up at one end. There were no signs of heat or tracks. He also stated that a Mrs. [redacted] and her daughter of Glenwood had seen a long, red streak in the sky East of Glenwood at 12:00 midnight.

Mrs. [redacted] was not available for interview, but her daughter, Miss [redacted] was questioned concerning their sighting. She described the object as a red light in the East travelling toward Gander. A check disclosed the light was seen in the vicinity of the Trans-Canada highway. There was a snowplow clearing the roads after two days of heavy snowfall, and it is very possible this is what they saw.

While investigating Mr. [redacted] sighting, a call came in from Flight Officer Miller, Duty Controller of the 226th aircraft control and Warning Squadron, at Gander, NX Newfoundland. He and two other men saw an object on their radar scope on a very erratic course. It disappeared from the scope to the West and they went outside to see if there was anything in the area. Upon further questioning, Flight Officer Miller revealed that, in his opinion, this object was definitely a bright star which appeared to change colors due to the atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time.

At 10:45 A.M., 27 February 1958, a ground party left Glenwood with
Mr. [redacted] to locate the clearing he claimed to have found, with no success.

Two officials of the Bowater's Woods Department, Glenwood, who knew
Mr. [redacted] for some time, were interviewed. It was learned that Mr.
[redacted] has a reputation - to put it mildly - [redacted]. This
is borne out by the fact that during the search, he made several inquiries
as to whether this incident would receive any publicity. When he was
informed that it probably would not, his assurance that he could find the
clearing again became less vehement.

Further search was not recommended due to the snow and brush
conditions. If the clearing could be located, aerial photos could be
taken and studied.

Because Mr. [redacted] cannot furnish more details or locate the clear-
ing, this is carried as an unknown [redacted].
