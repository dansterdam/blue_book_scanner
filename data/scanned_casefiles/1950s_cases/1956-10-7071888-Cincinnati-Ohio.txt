UFO News Report
By THOMAS M. COMELLA

EXCLUSIVE! . . . For the last few months TRC has been extensively investigating a series of sightings in the Cleveland, Ohio area. When all of the facts, diagrams and maps were integrated, we realized that these incidents formed one of the most comprehensive UFO files to be found anywhere.

For many weeks, TRC pondered what action should be taken and we finally placed the complete file in the hands of the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright Patterson Field, Dayton, Ohio. The case file was also sent to prominent persons in other governmental agencies. We feel that this file proves conclusively that unidentified flying objects are controlled by extra-terrestrial intelligences who are visiting the Earth for a very definite purpose.

Visitors Move in Close: Cleveland Observed: On October 14, 1955 in Iowa-driving north on Kemper Road in Cleveland, at approx. 7:20 p.m. a string of yellowish lights caught my attention in the upper right of my windshield. I pointed the objects out to my companion and we were both amazed at the strange arrangement of the strange objects. They were much brighter than the nearby car and street lights and stood out brilliantly in the night sky. I slowed down and we watched them make a gradual turn. They executed this maneuver simultaneously. As soon as possible I phoned my report to other investigators in the area with whom we had been working. The case was recorded last next month.

Later, at 8 p.m., Ed Smith of Cleveland telephoned me. He described an orange object with a dome on top that made several "passes" at the National Malleable Steel Bldg. The object projected two, beam-like lights downward before disappearing to the east. I immediately called Al Roush, who lives in South Euclid, an eastern suburb of Cleveland. Al told me that he and his wife had seen the object pass over their home the next day. TRC started an extensive investigation. The results of that investigation and Immediate interviewing revealed five other witnesses to the happening along a route from west to east. They included a country club doorman, a Sohio gas station attendant and local residents. Maps were drawn of the object's course and when all of the facts were correlated we had a very complete record of a UFO flight over Cleveland.

To establish the unknown classification, Al Roush spoke to many authorities whose business it is to know what goes on in the air. Mr. Hilliard, Safety Division of the C.A.A., told TRC that the only advanced explanation in the area was an "unidentified" sighting. Also, a discussion with Mr. Turner of the Goodyear Wingfoot Air Ship Base in Akron, Ohio, revealed that no blimp was over Cleveland that night or any other night that week!

Another check with Mr. Gorham of the Cleveland Air Taxi, Inc., proved that a helicopter could not have been responsible for the unusual sighting. With these results, Mr. Roush proceeded to the Canton Air Force Filter Center with his report. He was interviewed by a Sgt. Lee, who seemed extremely interested. After several conferences with officials of the base, Sgt. Lee told Mr. Roush "Well, we think what you saw was an unidentified flying object." Mr. Roush was told that the object's sharp turn and hover. This object is not in the text book. It seems so far. If a UFO is seen, we study it, get radar on it and send a report on to higher authorities at Wright Field. Dayton will conduct an investigation if necessary. If the sighting can be explained-fine, but if it cannot be explained we have orders not to release anything on it.

So ended the first part of our investigation. The next step was to plot the sightings and approximate the course of the UFO. The results were amazing!

The first record of the object was made by Ed Smith, a Pinkerton detective. He was on duty at National Malleable, when an object, with a dome, made three apparent "passes" at the building. [The rest of this paragraph is partially illegible]

The same object, or another one just like it, moved east toward the city. At 80th Street and Euclid Avenue, two residents at 80th Street, two people saw it later and gave a similar description, with one exception. The craft had evidently lost altitude in the witnesses reported that it was very low. Still, no sound was heard.

The farther cast the ship moved the closer it came to Earth. Until it moved over Roush's house in South Euclid, the general description was "a row of silent yellow lights". However, Al Roush could perceive a definite shape like the lights and seemed to be separated into two sections. The object was not described as level with the ground in altitude, droning sound. No navigation lights were on it. Instead, the shape was described as that of a plain, disc-shaped object, and it was still descending.

A Mr. Thompson, doorman at the Mayfield Country Club east of Roush's house, reported a terrific thunderous noise in the same area, although he didn't go outside. Also, at the same time...

No Case Information Only   2 October 1956   Trenton, New Jersey

1956.Oct.2-Delaware River-AN Object with a nauseating-odor swooped down and hovered over the Delaware River. It was large & Saucer-shaped. As it flew away, it made hissing sound...

Harry Sturdevant, Trenton, N.J., night watchman allegedly injured by UFO in October 1956, loses workmen's compensation April 21 on grounds that his experience was only a hallucination.

New Jersey man who claims he was injured as a result of a close encounter in 1956, has been refused workmen's compensation for his alleged incident. The Workmen's Compensation Board ruled that he suffered from hallucination. The claimant was Harry Sturdevant, who suffered from throat spasms, dizziness, and other symptoms, all caused by the saucer...

Case 229, Trenton, N. J., Oct. 2, 1956—We quote from the Trenton Evening Times as follows: Harry Sturdevant, a night watchman whose job is to guard equipment on a road project. At 3:45 am, Sturdevant was in a trailer outside when he saw a terrifying sight. A large glowing object swooped down out of the sky over the Delaware River. It came within a few feet of the trailer and then, as suddenly as it appeared, it took off again into the air... Sturdevant recalls that it was very probably over 100 feet in length—that it did not have wings, that it made a hissing sound as it dimmed over the water, and that it gave off an overpowering noxious odor. Sturdevant remembers that odor more vividly than anything else. It was so nauseous that he was already beginning to become ill.

No Case: Information Only    7 October 1956    Brooklyn, New York

CAIRO from Brooklyn, N.Y. Oct. 7, 1956. A Middle contained four individual statements by witnesses having seen a UFO. Sighted at 5:30 p.m. The object was generally described as oval-shaped and metallic or silver. Said witness Richard W'nderman, "The object was directly overhead. It looked oval and was shining like polished aluminum..." Moreover, in a southerly direction, it gave off no audible sound. While many case in themselves are not sensational, it is noteworthy that many recent sightings have been daylight occurrences.

Case 231, Springdale, Ohio, Oct. 9, 1956—By phone, Mrs. James Petrey, reported the following in brief: Four witnesses, at 9:30 p.m. watched, against a deep blue sky, six pinpoints of light moving with fantastic speed. It was difficult to watch them all, she was a day darted up and down, side to side. Strangest of all was the silvering strands that seemed to connect three of the objects.

Said Later, to the surprise of the witnesses, a countless number of red objects, swarming like birds, came in from the east. Flying in a straight horizontal path, the silent objects began dipping over and over, then disappeared. Sighted came from R was an astounding sight, said Mrs. Petrey.

AF-UFO REPORT ORDERED DESTROYED

Evidence that the Air Force destroys some official UFO reports has been given
to Prof. Charles A. Maney, NICAP Board Member, by an AP source. The photo-
copy below reproduces the top part of an Air Intelligence Information Report, cover-
ing a UFO sighting by two AF officers. Though the report is not unusual, the
"Destroy" order-which the source said was not uncommon-indicates a form
of censorship previously unknown to NICAP.

[A scanned Air Intelligence Information Report with a "DESTROY" stamp is shown]

Key points of sighting:
AF Witnesses: Capt. J.J. Pollack, USAF, Flight Commander, 55th Fighter Bomber
Squadron; Lt. J.S. Belsheim, USAF, Squadron Armament Officer.

Summary: Two glowing objects were sighted near the squadron base at Little
Easton, Essex, England, 9 Oct. 1956. Larger UFO was the size of a pea held at
arm's length (about one-half the size of the moon), similarly measured. Object
was five or six rays, with smaller rays between. At times, a longer,
broader ray appeared, possibly a trail or exhaust. Second object, smaller, descended
and approached the first one, then disappeared. Flight Commander Pollack was
Ketchum, USAF.

As stated above, it is the "Destroy" order, not this sighting, which is important.
The destruction of similar, officially verified reports will reduce the number of
AF pilots and other competent observers who are on record. Regardless of the
purpose, deletion of such UFO records can only result in misinforming the public.

No Case Information Only    12 October 1956    Denver, Colorado

Case 232, Denver, Colo., Oct. 12, 1956—Reports the Denver Post, "A mysterious ball of fire whistling through the sky, followed by a loud explosion sent police and firemen on an unusually search for a meteorite. Denvers and suburban police and fire stations received hundreds of calls from persons who saw the strange object about 5:30 p.m. Tom Nalty, assistant fire chief at station 13, said he saw a teardrop object fly over the firehouse at about 2000 feet at a high rate of speed. It was headed southeast and had a glowing trail near surface and was giving off a bright red object hanging about 200 feet over one of his corrals."

Cincinnati 27, Ohio

Captain C. T. Gregory
A.F.I.C
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Captain Gregory,

Enclosed herewith are three photographs and five negatives obtained by the writer from Mr. Ave., North College Hill, Cincinnati, Ohio, which may be of interest to your command. Mr. is a telescope number and told the writer that he formerly had been a professional photographer, and is at present, interested in astronomy, particularly lunar studies. He is in contact with members of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society. According to a photograph (which I have marked #3) with partial ovoid light cannot be easily explained, taken through his telescope, Mr. said that he knew of no light of any kind before 16 lens, nor was there of any unusual lights in the sky, that is, any lights appearing nearby which would show up at the size indicated. However, through powerful magnification an object, appearing visually as a pinpoint of light, may show up as photographically, titled out were noting ring phenomena.

Mr. told the writer that he photographed the "object" while taking a series of shots of the moon. He has many times spoken to the writer of his interest in the moon, and I feel certain that the photograph in question was not faked to deceive the writer or others. He spoke no trickery, in fact, also gave me permission to contact our command regarding the photographs.

You may contact Mr. for additional information regarding these photographs, if, in your opinion, I will send whatever additional information you may desire.

The photographs taken by Mr. were taken on Sunday, October 14, 1956. On this same date, CRIFO received three daytime sightings of UFOs from three separate groups of witnesses in the greater Cincinnati area. Names are as follows:

Mr. Covington, Kentucky Ave., Bromley, KY. Brilliant object seen no wind. While driving in traffic, he saw large bright light about the size of full moon. He said the object was stationary. By the time he had reached the next block, which afforded a visual clearing of the sky, the object had disappeared. Mr. stressed the fact that the object was unusually brilliant and large. He called out reflection on aircraft as an explanation. Mr. has a pilot's license.

Mr. and Mrs. [redacted], Batavia, Ohio. Having first learned of the sighting from Mrs. [redacted], an employee in the advertising department at the [redacted] Co., of which I am manager, I asked for more detailed information.

"On Sunday, Oct. 14, 1956 at about 6:30 pm, while traveling east on U.S highway 52, between Ripley and New Richmond, Ohio, I saw a reddish orange object in the sky. At first I thought it was a jet making a vapor trail, but the trail didn't seem to get any larger, in fact it all seemed to be traveling at the same speed, and, in a northerly direction for at least a minute then it turned straight up and disappeared out of sight."

[Hand-drawn note: "BRIGHT RED", "STARTING HERE IT WAS DEEP ORANGE", "THE BACK END WAS ALMOST PINK"]

When the object turned it did not make an arc but made a sharp turn like this [arrow drawn]

The whole thing seemed to turn at one time. A jet would have had a curve to its turn but this did not. My wife and son were with me at the time. She was driving so I did not take my eyes off it until it was out of sight. They all saw it."

Mr. [redacted] (and wife) [redacted], Pike, Ft. Thomas, Ky. Object sighted in Northeast from Highland Hts, Ky at about 1:30 pm. Mr. [redacted] described the object as large, about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. It was gun metal gray and without apparent wings or tail or other appendages. He said the object appeared to be stationary for about a minute, and was quite low.

Thus, in brief, are the descriptions of the UFO's seen by three separate groups on October 14, plus the photographs. I hope they may prove to be of value to you and your command.

In light of the international crisis, I hope that I may be able to serve your command more thoroughly and expeditiously. I have not yet phoned Lt. Colonel U. T. Greene in Washington in regard to the matter discussed by phone on November 6, 1956. I believe a phone call would only add to the confusion already existing as to my status. I might try by letter, however, hoping that clarification might be obtainable.

Sincerely,

P.S: Please return the enclosed photographs and negatives to the writer after analysis as they were left in my responsibility.

Cambridge 38, Massachusetts

Dear Dr. Hynek:

Attached herewith is a series of photographs submitted by the Director of "CRIFO and "The Craft," UFO publications. I am certain this gentleman needs no introduction, inasmuch as we have discussed him before. It may also interest you to know that his case file, containing material dating back a number of years, was submitted to Headquarters, Air Force, as a representative example of a "private" UFO research organization.

I submit these directly to you for evaluation rather than to our photo people because of the photo-astronomical aspects which, I feel, we do not have the degree of knowledge that your staff possesses.

Attached also is a copy of a letter from Mr. _______ relating, briefly, the circumstances under which these photos were taken. We shall keep this case in suspense, which we will call the "Boston Case," pending return of your analysis and comments.

At first glance, I am prompted to remark that in my younger days as a "keen teen," I attempted to attach a "brownie" camera to one end of a cardboard tube telescope to photograph the moon. I recall an oval-shaped object appearing on one of the photos, after I accidentally knocked the telescope completely around where it faced a light bulb. The camera being offset, tripoded, with the result that I actually photographed the opening of the telescope through the lens, black-painted tunnel of the tube.

It would have been interesting if the moon was in the same photo with the "object." As it is now, it could be anything photographed in the darkness. The absence of stars or other images in the background is significant, in view of the fact that if the sky was photographed with any degree of magnification, other celestial objects or lights would undoubtedly appear on the plate.

17 November 1956

Now, to less professional things. The last three weeks have been a little hectic on the home side. A full-dress rehearsal, plus a "command" performance to the people on our mutual project, was given recently. It came as a very pleasant surprise - but it was something that had been a prime objective of mine since tenure here. A multitude of items were covered with you during my visit to Boston. Will discuss this in detail with you later.

I should like to thank you in behalf of those members of the air science Division who were tendered invitations to witness the project in Vandalia. We certainly enjoyed it, and there was some interesting discussions the next day on "under-the-ears" applications of the instrument those considered during the Forum.

I have made payable to your consultant account the sum of four and one-half hours of contact services rendered on the 17th of October. I have just received a detailed report on the "L sightings" and I will send you a copy in due course. Your assumptions appear correct. Indications are that 31h additional paragraphs were not concurrent as to time. I will include a radar scope plot that is prepared in rather rough form. Some interesting things there, also.

Expecting to see you on our mutual project on or about the 27th, I remain

Sincerely yours,

Incls

454/Capt. G.T. Gregory, Hq
65216

Cincinnati 27, Ohio

This is to acknowledge your letter of 12 January 1957 in which you request the status and disposition of certain negatives and photographs submitted by your office and subsequently received by this Center on 12 November 1956 for assessment and analysis.

You are advised that we have made our analysis of the objects shown in the photographs. In turn, we have submitted the material to the Photographic Observa tory, Cambridge, Massachusetts with whom we collaborate on such matters. Therefore, there cannot be any question as to the findings whether actual, eliminating speculation or a hoax, and this is considered the outstanding intelligence in that field.

However, due to the pre-Christmas mass of business, and the fact that the specialists at this institute handling this type of photography were called out of the country on the IGY program, we are unable to send you the material at this time.

We have been informed that the material will be returned to us upon their return to the United States.

An extra copy is made of this correspondence which you may submit if you so desire.

Sincerely,

[Redacted] Avenue
Cincinnati, 27, Ohio

Dear Mr. [Redacted]:

Attached herewith are the original three (3) photographs and five (5) negatives which you submitted to this organization for review and comment on 7 November 1956. Reference is also made to your letter of 12 January 1957 in which you requested the status and disposition of this material.

We regret the delay, but as part of the study and reviews, the photographs were submitted to a scientist who later was assigned to an overseas project, leaving them behind.

With respect to our findings, please be advised that the photographs and negatives were subjected to a series of microscopic and other examinations, including a motion picture size projection. The light appears to be emanating from an outside source into a container, believed to be the inside of a telescope tube, and photographed with the camera at the eye piece and being at a slight tilt or angle. A comparison of the sky around the moon with the dark portion around the ovoid of light, further indicates that the latter coloration is not a photograph of the sky. The fringe of light to the left of the ovoid (in our opinion, an opening) attests to this.

We are not in position to comment whether your source, which you state is an astronomer, was or was not aware of this, or if this is merely a case of an attempted hoax, with you as an unwitting intermediary.

Copies have been made of the original material to be included with our analysis and other data in case files.

Sincerely,
