Mrs. [redacted]
New Madison, Ohio

Wednesday
May 20, 1959

Dear Sirs:

Observed in the West last night, Tuesday, May 19, 1959 at approximately 10:30 P.M., a round haze of light or no definite proportion. It was observed from Arcanum, Ohio. I turned onto Route 121 returning to New Madison from Arcanum, Ohio. I watched the light for nearly a half-mile after which Mrs. [redacted] stopped her car to view the light. It lasted only a few seconds, staying in a near a stationary position as we could discern, and faded away until we could no longer distinguish it in the sky.

I was up shortly after 3:00 A.M. to close West windows and again saw the light in the same direction. It was brighter and larger and I awakened my wife on coming close to view it. He said it appeared to be a searchlight beam with no visible beams from the horizon, and at that hour, hardly seem probable.

My description would be that it gave appearances of a moon behind clouds - or a light fairly circular or smoke - with no definite shape except that it seemed to change proportions by slightly elongating itself at times. The phenomena lasted approximately 25 minutes as it was twenty minutes until 4:00 A.M. when I returned to the house after viewing it.

On both occasions there seemed to be a fraction of a second when the mass seemed to have color - yellow. When the light faded, it faded as were visible without haze.

I am forwarding this report in case it should be of importance and interest to you. There is probably a logical explanation for the light; however, since we do not know ourselves, it seems it should be reported to you.

Sincerely,
[signature redacted]
New Madison, Ohio
