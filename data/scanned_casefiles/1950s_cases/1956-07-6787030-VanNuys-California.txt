STATEMENT

Monday 16, 16 Jul 56:

I was awakened at 4 AM by the barking of my two collie dogs. I tried to go back to sleep but the dogs continued to bark - I began to worry that neighbors would call police so I got up to investigate. I went to the door and turned on a house and porch light by means of a wall switch. On my lawn there were two dogs looking toward the phone pole across the street. About thirty feet above said pole was what appeared to be a round sphere or gold metallic substance - this sphere drifted slowly and silently toward my front (street side) yard or lawn.

The first sound above or other than the dogs barking was that of a rustling of the leaves of the California Elm Tree in the center of my yard, as the object began to settle earthward in what appeared to be the center of the tree. Then slowly a slow crashing of the tree as the ball began to near the ground. From what appeared to be the height of the object or some sort of electrical field close the tree was not so that only one of the double trunks remained standing.

The ball seemed to settle about 8 to 10 inches from the ground, never completely coming to rest.

Now to my utter amazement, 3 men emerged from the ball and one spoke in what sounded to be a tone record voice. "We are from Venus." "We are your friends." I stepped forward and automatically shock the man's hand and then my 5 year old son. The men began to give or nod to the man's arm near the wrist. With this, all three backed into the vehicle which had no apparent door or portal.

The ball closed and then took off at a tremendous speed, leaving behind a thoroughly amazed witness - I noticed a warm blast or similar to the opening of an oven.

Thursday, 19 Jul 56:

It was noon when I arrive home from work - Of course I had convinced myself by this time that I had a hallucination on the previous Monday and that the tree had fallen naturally. Not that I have had any such thing happen before but the inherent possibility of the preceding experience seemed more to an I could relate to even my closest friends or relatives. However, it was this part of the story that I was chewing over.

I had relaxed on a yard couch to not a sudden when I placed at my roof in the back yard after a few minutes. There on the roof again, never quite touching was the same ball, for a moment I thought that I had looked at or seen an and had become temporarily blind, however, from the moment I jumped off the seat I knew that this was not the case. Here on my roof was the same sphere, the only difference was that it looked slightly smaller than it had previously.

I went inside the house and telephoned the police to see if there had been any such inside the house and telephone the police. When he arrived, the reply was "Much have you had to drink?"

Receiving no satisfaction there I called my local newspaper, the Citizens News, and was put on to a reporter who had several reports on the same day and was exact. The reporter said that he had heard an article and was told me that I had heard an I gave him my full story, including the episode of eighteen inches ball.

Monday, 30 Jul 56:

I came home at approximately 5:45, fixed my dog's dinner and went into the back yard to feed them. I had no sooner stepped into the yard than I saw it again. This time there were two men and they motioned for me to come over. My better judgment told me not to but I nevertheless went over to the thing. The warmth and friendliness of the people from this craft are the only things which can explain my having enough confidence to go on the side which I shall describe below.

This is the incredible part of my story which I'm sure will make it hard for anyone who has not experienced any such thing to believe. But being of I hope, sound mind, I relate the following and swear someday in the not too distant future my experience will be proven without a doubt.

In the same quality of tape recording voice, I was asked to go for a short trip to the "Nude Craft." With legs trembling and much eye twitching, I entered the ball with my heart in my mouth and sweat actually pouring from under my arms.

The inside was unlike the outside (cold Color). It was translucent and appeared to be made of a plexiglass type material. There was no place and light seemed to be refracted and swirled but no dark coloration was noticeable such as one might expect if they looked through sun glasses. There were no doors and the answer that was given to me when I asked how we go into the thing was: "By reversing the polarity of the atoms." For a few seconds I would just look for me we were able to see the earth receding beneath us, then swirling - I having vision from an all four sides and having only glass beneath me and above as I had constant feeling of the possibility of falling, though the thing as it was so clean. I kept slightly terrific from one foot to the other. The ball traveled from my back lawn to the place I can't mention - a position some 700 miles above earth and L.A., California in a matter of 60 seconds - rapid flight about 15 to 25 seconds, the rest of the time taken in the track or the sphere or globe into the "Master Craft."

I was then escorted from some sort of air lock up a ramp and into the ship or what I control and floating room. A clear room and a clean one with a gymnasium. There were about a dozen men in the room working on charts and various instruments along the walls. I was taken to a table where I have no motion and I had no feeling of being adrift. I sat down at once, the seats near the desk and huge arm rests began to come out. I was asked to drink a glass of water, relax, with a sort of trance to it. About 30 seconds to a minute and I began to feel completely relaxed. The water apparently contained some sort of sedative that had an almost tranquilizing effect. My legs stopped shaking and the twitching of my eyelids and muscles ceased.

I tried to ask how as much information as I could but I was so held in awe with surroundings that I just was held in a sort of "Limbo trance."

When I asked why I was taken said, "Why me?" the one who spoke said that they wanted to relay me for the "unnecessary damaging of my lovely yard tree" and that this was one of many given and "known" assignments. There are no controls in the Globe and all control takes place in the Master Glide Craft. Their landing was a smooth as glass and they were previously apprising for the damage done to my tree and the inconvenience of my having to move the tree and pay for cartage of many things up the dump.

When I inquired of the man's age I was told that he was over 500 years old. To look at him one would say they were approximately 25 to 30, 35 tops. I have no idea what secret they have for this the only thing I can say is what they told me and that "we have their arguments this time is over."

The answer to my question of their communications was obvious without the necessity of even asking. They spoke through their air developed telepathic way.

STATEMENT (Cont.)

When I asked them what motive of power their various craft used, I was asked if I know anything about the "Challenary Line". I shook my head and he smiled as one might in a sort of pleasant pity at the slight off a spate of mentally crippled person and gave me the following word grouping which I put down as phonetically as possible:

Inds Veends Wo'a des Vril -
Deld dele Gemdnlcg Round and Round the Revels pin -
Twe Sheik Iko-pin -
Fuazek Plnd Out -
0.593 +2 x by the 500th power

On the various scopes or round similar TV screens, most of which were blacked out, I saw the Mother Ship or "Gigan Line" which was on two screens at once. They both appeared to be the same view of said ship.

I was told that it took 110 earth years to build this monster whose dimensions are 15.5 miles in length and it has 37 decks. I was told that it has a hanger or landing station on their planet and did not remain aloft at all times as a satellite. They have only 7 of these ships.

I give you all these statistics with the hope that you may have or receive duplicate information.

I was soon escorted back to the hall and back in the yard of my home here in San Fernando Valley.

Observing the clock at the time of my return, I noticed the time to be 6:125 PM.

The exact time of my departure I am not sure. I only know that I left the office at 5 or somewhere there about and my ride home at rush hour takes all of a half hour.

I have little more to add to this. I only pray God that the officials of our Government will accept this as a fact and not some wild dream of some frustrated person. Taking a person who had no prior belief in such, what I have described exactly what I saw without hearing my story first.

The fact that my tree was clearly split at 4 AM, 16 July, this corroborates by next door neighbor for you officers at my home today (also cracking of tree).

The fact that there is a depression of 34 inches in my back lawn and that burned material was taken from the soil that same night of 30th July leaves me with the only conclusion that this is a Stark Clear Reality.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. Due to the publicity given to SOURCE's alleged experience and indications of it being a publicity stunt, contacts were necessarily limited to avoid any new release involving the Air Force.

2. Col. Max O. Mitchell, Chief ATIC Western Office, was contacted prior to any action by this organization. Col. Mitchell stated that he contacted SOURCE by telephone as directed and made an appointment for an interview. He was advised by SOURCE that TV, Radio and the press would be present for the interview. Coordination with Public Information, CALIC and advised to disassociate his investigation. Col. Mitchell advised the Investigators that a Mr. Harry Wilcox at the Van Nuys News Center had also contacted him on this matter on 2 August 1956. (See para 6). Col. Mitchell further stated that he was not interested in being recalled to active duty and working on UFOB investigations inasmuch as he had a great deal of experience with them. It was then considered advisable to contact SOURCE through Mr. May.

3. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Los Angeles, California, was contacted in hope of finding background information on either SOURCE or Mr. May.

4. The Norton Air Force Base Office of Information Services was contacted and an appointment made to visit the Los Angeles office. It was learned from the Los Angeles office that SOURCE had been interviewed by a Mr. Grant Holcomb, a news reporter on the CBS Television program "PANORAMA PACIFIC" at 0720 hrs (0314092) 23 July 1956 concerning his experiences at Van Nuys.

5. The Ground Observer Filter Center (det 2, 471st Ground Observer Sq) at Pasadena, California, was contacted and it was learned that no unusual sightings had been reported by the unit in the Van Nuys area. It was learned that the duty log at the filter center indicated a call made 31 July 1956 at 1930 hrs (013056 Aug 56) 31 July 56. Both calls were queries concerning how to contact the ATIC Western Office or Army Criminal Intelligence.

6. [Redacted name] at [redacted location] was contacted at work where he is employed as an instructor in the training branch. In response to a known SOURCE and if he was familiar with the incidents which had taken place, he replied that he had become very talkative with SOURCE since he had seen SOURCE on 28 July following his TV appearance. SOURCE stated that he had immediately taken great interest in the subject. Since no one knew SOURCE's background for the past nine years, he considers himself very well informed on the subject of Flying Saucers.

of flying objects adorned the wall and a bookshelf contained approximately
fifty books and publications on UFO's, space travel and astronomy.
Mr. stated that he was authoring two books in saucers' history, and that
they would probably be published in the Fall, titled "SAUCERS AND YOU,"
and "SPACEMEN, WITCHES OR WHAT."  SOURCE arrived at approximately 1930 hrs
and after a short conversation, related his story. In the course of SOURCE's
story, Mr. produced two drawings which he had reproduced from sketches
made by SOURCE. These were the Control Craft and the Giganta-Liner (See Incl
#4)! SOURCE agreed that they were copies of what he had drawn for Mr. ____
(Z-38) on the drawing of the Giganta-Liner. This could be a mistake on
part but the incident allegedly took place on 30 July. After relating his
story, SOURCE was asked to write a statement. He replied that he would do so
on the following day at 10 AM and invited the investigators to be there at
that time.

7. Interview was conducted on the morning of 14 August at approximately
1015 hrs. As stated previously, the investigators had an appointment with SOURCE at
10 AM; however, upon arriving at his home, no one would answer the doorbell.
It was, however, approximately five minutes with no results. Knocking was tried
with also no results. At this time, _______ was contacted and stated that
to the best of _______ knowledge SOURCE was home but the was a very sound
sleeper and very difficult to wake up. When asked if _______ had witnessed any of
these events, _______ stated that he role of the tree in SOURCE's front yard had
awakened _______ at the same time reported by SOURCE but that _______ had witnessed
nothing. At this point _______ seemed rather nervous and became rather further and
particularly agitated. At 1030 AM, SOURCE was up and an investigator was admitted.

8. The burnt and depressed area pointed out by SOURCE in his back yard
revealed nothing of striking significance other than the burnt sod. This was
the area where the sphere allegedly landed on 30 July, an area much more when
was found in the front yard where, on 30 July, SOURCE had pointed out and there were no markings of any kind on the roof of his home where the
exact location was. The sphere of the tree in SOURCE's front yard
might best be explained by a bolt of lightning. This would also explain the
"sonic boom" reported by SOURCE to have occurred just prior to the splitting
of the tree. No sign of lightning damage was found on the tree. A check with
the local Air Force Base weather office revealed that no weather condition existed
in that area at that time which could create a bolt of lightning. The split
was not made by an instrument such as an axe or a saw, but rather it appeared
to have been made by something pushing or pulling the trunk apart. The wood
was definitely not rotten.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. It is the conclusion of the preparing officer that this has a case of hallucinations, a series of very vivid dreams or possibly a hoax.

a. SOURCE is a very congenial and sincere young man but he does appear to be very high strung and emotional.

b. SOURCE stated in all sincerity that immediately following his "ride" he felt that he should let the whole world know about his experience but, after suffering public ridicule, he wanted to avoid further publicity of any kind even though he, in his own mind, is firmly convinced that these incidents actually took place.

c. SOURCE is a very sound sleeper and extremely difficult to wake up.

d. No striking physical evidence could be found.

e. There is a possibility of collaboration with [redacted] to publicize his forthcoming book.

f. Two similar reports were received by the local newspaper at the same time as SOURCE'S sighting on 19 July. Both reports were that a spherical, gold colored ball landed near an aerial farm without the use of doors. However, the callers had refused to give their names. This could possibly lend credence to the fact that it was a preplanned hoax.

UFO sighting and incident in Van Nuys, California is subject. Message in three parts.

Part One: IAW 200-4 request interview and/or preliminary investigation of unusual sighting by Mr. [redacted], Van Nuys, California. Sighting reported to ATIC via long distance phone late night 31 July. Received by duty officer, who in turn, erroneously contacted Col Mitchell, Chief, ATIC Western Office, Pasadena, California, for informal check. Sighting is without doubt a hoax, but certain events have made it necessary that additional information be obtained on this case because of the adverse publicity that may arise to the detriment of the Air Force.

Part Two: Brief summary of sighting. According to [redacted] spherical vehicle landed from sky into his residence grounds on 16 July, splitting a tree during descent. Three six-foot creatures emerged from vehicle, and conversed with him by telepathic means with voices that sounded like wire recordings, then departed. Space vehicle returned again on night of 30 July, at which [redacted] into vehicle, where

he took a short flight into space at high speeds.

Part Three: Background Information. Col Mitchell made telephone contact with
Mr. [redacted] merely to effect an informal interview and obtain some impression of
source. [redacted], who was found to be a member of CBS, insisted that newspaper
reporters and TV be present. Obviously a planned publicity stunt. Consequently,
Col Mitchell called ATIC explaining situation, was advised not to pursue matter
further. However, opinion of this Center is that [redacted] will undoubtedly give
story to newspapers that Air Force is concerned and contacted him on sighting.
Recommend that Col Mitchell or Sgt Garner be contacted by your nearest ATIS unit
for particulars before any contact be made with [redacted]. Request results of action
taken be submitted to ATIC as soon as possible in order that they be passed on to
HQ USAF/DI and USAF PIO as material to counter any adverse publicity that may arise
regarding this matter.

COMMENT NR 3

Through: L. G. Whitcher [handwritten note with date] 2/1/57

A careful examination was made of the two samples of turf submitted.

The sample of normal turf from the surrounding area consisting of a small amount of sandy soil on which was growing the creeping herb, Dichondra repens Forst. var. carolinense (Michx.) Choisy. This species grows on wet pinelands, low grounds, and as a weed in lawns from Florida to Texas and north to southeast Virginia and Arkansas. It is not known whether it is also found in lawns in California. The plant specimen consisted of a mass of creeping stems with attached leaves and mature fruit. The mature fruit indicated that the specimen must have been collected in midsummer or later.

The other sample or burned turf from the depression also consisted of sandy soil on which Dichondra was growing, but the leaves and many of the fruits of the specimen were carbonized although still recognizable, indicating that the flame or heat source that had burned the leaves was superficial and not intense. In this specimen were also fragments, both charred and uncharred, of leaves from another but unidentified species of plant, presumably a tree or shrub. Such leaf fragments are not present in the uncharred specimen.

The samples were checked for radioactivity. There was no difference between the two samples, and both show normal background radioactivity.

Samples of both the normal and burned turf were examined spectrographically. As preparation, the samples were dried at 110°C, ground to a fine mesh, and quartered. One-quarter of each sample has been reserved for future use if necessary. One-half of the remaining three quarters was ignited at 500 degrees, and both the dried and ignited portions were subjected to spectrographic analysis.

There were approximately 21 elements found in the two samples, and 20 of these appeared to be present in the two samples in similar amounts. The two samples appeared to be different with respect to lead and cobalt contents. The normal or unburned sample showed less than .001 per cent and less than .005 per cent cobalt and lead, both higher than would be expected in soils.

Various possible explanations for the observed differences in cobalt and lead contents have been considered, but there is no apparent method of confirming any of these suppositions.

In the case of cobalt, this element is known to be found in soils, but the amount of .05 to 0.2 per cent is an excess of the maximum ever observed. It certainly would not be expected that the cobalt content would vary so much in two samples taken in adjacent areas. Cobalt does not act as either a fungicide or insecticide, so probably was not present as a result of spraying of the area.

sampled. The metal contents of various crude oils does not seem to explain the presence of cobalt in the charred sample as possible residual from burning of a cobalt-containing fuel. This metals vanadium, nickel, and copper are normally present in most crude oils in an order of magnitude greater than for cobalt, and these metals were not observed either to differ in the two samples or be present in so large an amount as was indicated for cobalt in the charred sample.

If the charred sample were taken in an area where trash containing some cobalt glass had been burned, cobalt in the amount found might be possible.

The lead content of the charred sample might have occurred as a result of spraying of the sampled area using an insecticide such as arsenate of lead or by the burning of a lead-containing fuel such as ethyl gasoline. No indications have been found of normal lead contents in the solids in this charred sample examined.

This comment is considered to have fulfilled the request of Comment Nr 1 dated January 18, 1957. The portions of the samples remaining are enclosed herewith.

1. In accordance with established policies for the study and analysis of unidentified objects, and/or material therefrom, request subject specimen be submitted to "general analysis" to determine whether any unusual element or matter is involved.

2. To provide you with some background and information, applicable material taken from the case file is attached. Very extensive investigations were made on this case because of its recognized potential for trouble. Headquarters USAF concurs in this respect.

3. The sighting was evaluated as a "hors" immediately upon receipt of all preliminary data from the initial investigation. It is unfortunate that an analysis should be made when the nature of the case is already known. However, the publicity it has received in the Los Angeles area, the near involvement of ATIC's Western Office, and that from many he reported at some future date by request of higher authority, dictated this action. Headquarters USAF concurs in this respect.

4. A report of general analysis showing, for example, that "the turf supposedly burnt by some unknown propulsive force indicates nothing other than...." if that be the case, will be sufficient.

4. The Chief of the Western Office desiring to avoid undue publicity for the Air Force, telephoned Captain George T. Gregory informing him of the turn of events and requested that the Western Office be relieved from the responsibility for investigation. Such was granted. This office did not investigate further and the matter has apparently "dropped". No further action will be taken by the western Office regarding this reported incident. This office recommends that none be taken by any organization in view of the fantastic story relayed by telephone by Mr. [illegible name] and his apparent desire to gain publicity.

TO AFOIN-4X2a FROM Western Office DATE 6 Aug 56 COMMENT NO. 1
LtCol Mitchell/mlb

1. Reference is made to telephone call from Captain Kalmus, Duty Officer, ATIC, on Tuesday, 31 July 1956, regarding a report of UFO by Mr. [redacted], Van Nuys, California.

2. At the request of Captain Kalmus, this office attempted on 1 August 1956, to make preliminary investigation regarding the reported objects. Telephone inquiry to Mr. [redacted] revealed essentially the following:

"On the night of 16 July, I went to bed about 10:30 p.m. and was awakened at 0400 by dogs barking. I was afraid the dogs would disturb the neighbors, and got up to quiet them. I looked up to the sky and saw a golden ball drifting very slowly. I appeared to be completely noiseless, until it landed in the top of a tree in my back yard. It wedged into the tree and split it open. Two or three guys got out of the ball and talked to me on a tape recorded sounding voice. 'We are from that you call Venus'. They were there only a few minutes until one of my dogs began to chew into the wrist of one of the men. The men backed into the ball and instantly disappeared. The golden light went out of sight completely, noiselessly. There was a tremendous sensation of hot air when the ball disappeared. During the afternoon of 30 July, I was home in the back yard sunbathing and about 3:30 I opened my eyes and again I saw the golden ball. At first I thought I was seeing something, as a result of looking up into the sun for a long time but discovered that there was actually this golden ball landed on my roof top. It was 8 to 10 ft in diameter. Two guys got out of the ball and called me over to them. They said 'We are sorry that we landed and broke your tree and we are controlled by electro magnetic frequencies from our guide craft. There are no controls in this ball; they watch us on a screen and this is the first time in several years it was made a mis-landing. The men were about 6'6" tall. They took me for a ride. We went 700 miles up above Los Angeles and met with the guide craft. While I was in the huge super, no one paid any attention to me, they were a very busy with graphs, charts, etc. We were gone a total of 25 minutes. And by looking down one could see a triangle of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas. Since the incident, I have been flooded with calls by people who refuse to identify themselves, except as scientists, reporters, or something. The only names I have are: Marilyn Boone, a reporter, and Mr. Harry Way from Rocketdyne."

3. Immediately following the telephone inquiry from this office, Mr. [redacted] apparently called certain press personnel at the CBS Television Network in the Los Angeles area, reporting that the Air Force was to investigate the incident.

Following is an extract from SDO Capt "Almus" report 31 Jul-1 Aug 56 for your
information and necessary action. The ATIC Form 164 is attached.

"1800 hrs Received a long distance-call from Mr S*, Van Nuys, Calif, Phone Nr ______. I was awake by my dogs in the backyard. I looked out just in time to see a round object with a golden glow heading toward a large tree in my yard. It kept coming as I watched, and finally hitting the tree and coming to rest. Three people(?) got out of the ball and announced they were from Venus. When they talked (it sounded like a recording), my dogs started to bark and my female bit one of them. They entered the ball (it was about 8 ft dia) closed the door and went straight up. I was shaking like a leaf and was sure I was completely out of my mind. (SDO comment: "ma,too") The following night I went out and got drunk and was determined to put this thing completely out of my thoughts. I did a pretty good job too, until last night, 30 Jul 56, when they came back. (SDO comment: This does not finish the information received, however, it goes from the ridiculous to the sublime, including a ride in the 8 ft dia ball up to the mother ship 700-800 miles above Los Angeles in about 15 seconds.) I'm sending this very sincere and extremely concrete that he could hardly be interested enough in his story to investigate and at least examine his broken tree and the burned indentation in his lawn where the ball had landed.) I diplomatically ranked 'im. ("SDO comment: the ball was round, I was assured him no would investigate.")

"1630 hrs. Unable to contact Capt Gregory. As the report came from the LA area, I called Lt Col Max Mitchell and gave the address and phone number. He will make a preliminary investigation and advise."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Flight 1-C, 4502d AISS                REPORT NO. 10-UFO-3-2-56    PART ONE    PAGE 2    OF 14

Age: 25
Occupation: Property and Scenery Technician (television)

                Free Lance

Education: 1½ years college (liberal arts) Syracuse University, N. Y.

Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appears to be a sincere young man with above average intelligence. He gave thorough to each question, seemingly searching his memory for exactness, before answering. During the first part of the interview SOURCE was hesitant to talk about his experience as he felt he would be considered a "crackpot" regardless of what he said. However, when he did begin to tell of his experience, he seemed composed in what he was saying. It is the opinion of the interviewer that SOURCE either honestly believes he lived the experience or is an excellent actor.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS AND EVENTS:

1. On the morning of 16 July 1955, SOURCE was awakened by a sound he thought to be a "sonic boom." Immediately after SOURCE heard the sound, his two (2) dogs began barking loudly. Due to previous complaints by neighbors to the police about SOURCE's dogs barking at night, SOURCE got out of bed to quiet the dogs. When SOURCE went into the front yard he discovered the dogs were barking at a gold colored sphere near a telephone pole near SOURCE's front yard. When first observed by SOURCE the object was approximately 150 feet away from him to the north, west, and east in the sky and was descending slowly. As the object descended it moved in the direction of SOURCE's yard. Incidentally SOURCE was in Van Nuys, California. (See Incl #1) in SOURCE's yard. Although the object did not seem to touch the trees, one of the trucks pulled broke away from the tree and crashed to the ground. The object descended into the yard and several eight (8) to ten (10) inches off the front lawn. SOURCE observed three (3) men emerge from the object with an opening. The men walked through the wall of the object. The men had shoulder length blond hair, clear, deep green, sharp German-like features and were about six (6) feet seven (7) inches tall. They were dressed in green-blue pieces suits that had built-in shoes. One of the men, who seemed to be a leader spoke to SOURCE in English with a monotone voice that sounded like a tape recording. The man's words were, "We are from what you call Venus; we are your friends." SOURCE stepped forward to shake hands with the man. As SOURCE shook hands with him he noticed that the hand was very soft like that of a person employed in a job that required very little use of the hands. When SOURCE spoke with the man, his dog snapped at the man's wrist, and this seemed to frighten him. The man then backed through the wall of the object and the object just seemed to disappear. SOURCE felt a rush of warm air but heard no sound. SOURCE then went into his house and noticed the time was 0115 (0615½ vol. 56). SOURCE first thoughts were that he was losing his mind and tried very hard to keep from thinking about the incident. However, when SOURCE looked at the broken trees he could not keep from thinking about the incident.

from thinking about the incident. By 19 July 1956, SOURCE had almost convinced himself that his imagination was playing tricks on him, but at approximately 1430 (191302 July 56) while relaxing in his back yard, he glanced northward toward his house and observed what he believed to be same object hovering about 12 inches over the roof of his house. SOURCE immediately shouted his neighbor's name - SOURCE was now in a state of complete frustration, but was now convinced that the incident on 16 July 56 was a reality. SOURCE then went into his house and called the police to find out if there had been other witnesses to the sighting. The policeman on duty inquired at SOURCE and told SOURCE that he "should either take another drink or go to bed." SOURCE then called the office of the Hollywood Citizen's News.

The reporter with whom SOURCE spoke stated that two (2) other calls had been received from persons observing apparently similar objects and would like to interview SOURCE. SOURCE agreed to the interview on the basis that no mention of his name would be made in any article resulting from the interview. During subsequent interview, SOURCE also related the incident of 16 July 56. The reporter told SOURCE that the other persons reporting the objects had refused to be interviewed and gave no address. The article published the next day (20 July 56) irritated SOURCE because of the "mocking" manner in which it was written; however, the article did mention the other two (2) observations and for a brief period after the incident that followed on 30 July 1956.

At approximately 1800 hours (310302 July 56) the evening of 30 July 56, SOURCE went into his back yard to feed his dogs and discovered what appeared to SOURCE to be the same object hovering 5 to 10 inches off the lawn. There were two (2) men, exactly as observed on 16 July 56, standing beside the object. SOURCE removed near-notching device from his pocket and approached the two (2) men. In the same tape-recorded-type voice, one of them, when SOURCE believed to be the same man then, on 16 July 56, said: "Would you care to go for a short ride to the Craft?" SOURCE asked if they would bring him back and the man said: "It will take only a short time." SOURCE then connected to 99. The two (2) men placed SOURCE in the middle and they all walked through the wall of the object in single file. SOURCE asked how it was possible to walk through the wall of the object and was told, "We are arranging the polarity of the atoms". The object seemed to SOURCE to be a solid metallic substance from the outside, but, from inside, SOURCE appeared to be made of a slightly tinted glass or plastic substance and was like being inside "nothing." SOURCE could see through the object for only about two (2) seconds during the ascent which took approximately thirty (30) seconds. During the ascent SOURCE experienced an extreme hunger sensation which caused his mouth to fill with saliva; also, he perspired profusely. From inside the object SOURCE looked at two and saw the "inside Craft." The inside Craft had three (3) other golden colored, sphere-shaped objects attached to what SOURCE believed to be the bottom of the "Craft." SOURCE was suspended by its side. The object in which SOURCE was riding entered the "outside Craft" in an arc-like manner. SOURCE then felt that they walked out of the sphere in the same manner they entered; SOURCE then reports that they entered a room which SOURCE refers to as "Control Room." (See Incl #3). Inside this Control Room, SOURCE noted various types of maps on the walls and what appeared to be television screens. SOURCE's guide, but they were all engaged in various activities and appeared to SOURCE as "busy creatures."
