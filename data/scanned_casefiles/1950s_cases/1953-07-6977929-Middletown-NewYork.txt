As at initial investigation it appears to be an item related to a sighting of a light or lights. The very peculiar feature of this flame is the remarkably strange, unusual movement and behavior of the same. As a matter of fact, the flame appeared to have been a living thing of itself, and almost appear to have been a "self-propelled" kind of light. It moved about in rather erratic fashion, not at all like the normal behavior of a flame as we know it.

A very peculiar occurence which we could not very well explain, as there were several of us viewing the same phenomena, and it did not appear to conform at all to any normal behavior of a fire, or flame, as we generally understand it. It has been another I have ever seen the like of, and may prove to be a very unique type of lighting effect, the reasons for which we do not fully understand as yet.

Some additional notes.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: U. S. A.
REPORT NO: (G-30-53)e
PLACE: MIDDLETOWN, NEW YORK
DATE OF INFORMATION: 6/7/53
DATE OF REPORT: 6/30/53

SUMMARY: (A recent preliminary report by the Middletown, New York, Civil Defense Ground Observer Corps states that an observation of a strange aerial object was made on 6/7/53 at approximately 10:00 PM, EDT, over Middletown, New York. The object was observed for about 15-20 minutes.) The illuminated FLYOBJECT, reported by persons, appeared at white, large, round object, moving fairly slowly at an approximate altitude of 8,000-10,000 feet. It was compared in size with a jet fighter, but much larger. The object was clearly seen by the observers and remained fairly stationary for most of the observation period. At the conclusion of the observation, the object moved off rapidly to the north and disappeared from sight. (See attached report.)

The document describes a sighting of an unidentified flying object with details such as the date and time of the sighting, location, estimated distance and altitude, as well as the observed characteristics of the object.

1. The following information was submitted to this headquarters and
is forwarded in compliance with current directives:

a. Reported by: 
[Information redacted]
Middletown, New York

b. Date and time of sighting:
9 July 1953, approximately 1515-1530

c. Place of visual sighting: 
Downgrades Park, located on the north side of  
Middletown, New York

d. Estimated distance from observer to object:
Approximately 1 to 5 miles looking northwest, altitude, 2,000 feet.

e. Informants stated that object appeared suddenly, and the very
high speed and small light did not flash signal lights as appears on
aircraft. Object seemed to be traveling at a high altitude (approximately
15,000 to 20,000 feet) and hovered over the area for several minutes.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This page appears to be a document titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" from Project Blue Book.

The text of the document is as follows:

THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECTS WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, BUT OBSERVERS STATED THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE FLAT, OR SLIGHTLY CURVED, DISCS. THE OBJECTS WERE QUITE POSITIVE THAT THE OBJECTS DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THEY WERE QUITE POSITIVE THAT THE OBJECTS WERE LARGER THAN ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT IN THEIR AREA AND THEY WERE QUITE POSITIVE THAT THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING AT AN EXTREMELY HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

2. WEATHER: 
a. LIGHT CLEAR DAY, VISIBILITY EXCELLENT, WITH VERY LIGHT WIND.
b. AIR TRAFFIC: OBSERVERS HAD OBSERVED SOME TRAFFIC, SUCH AS CARGO PLANES IN THE GENERAL VICINITY, WHICH APPEARED TO BE HEADING FOR STEWART AFB, BUT NOTHING SIMILAR TO THE OBJECTS THEY OBSERVED.

3. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE INTERVIEWER THAT THE OBSERVERS WERE INTELLIGENT, STABLE AND RELIABLE PERSONS AND THAT THEIR OBSERVATION WAS MADE IN GOOD FAITH. THEIR DESCRIPTION WAS QUITE DETAILED AND THEY SEEMED TO BE QUITE POSITIVE ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW, SO THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO DISBELIEVE THEIR STORY.
