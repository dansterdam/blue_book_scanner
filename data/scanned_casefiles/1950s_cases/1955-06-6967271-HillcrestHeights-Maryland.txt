II. RELIABILITY: Good
III. SOURCES DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCES had been standing in the driveway of [redacted] when the object was observed. He first noticed the object in the sky, however, the absence of noise caused to look this out as a possibility. The object was stationary, with slight oscillation up and down motion, and at times would disappear and reappear a short distance away, always maintaining a fairly constant altitude and velocity. The visible outline of the object was there any trail or exhaust. There was also no sound from Andrews AFB, but could be heard. He went inside to call his wife to observe the object, however, by the time she came out, the phenomenon was no longer visible. The time of observation was approximately ten minutes. The object seemed to fade finally into the distance. The phenomenon was observed for a period of ten minutes.

The report describes an incident where the crew of a flight reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on June 23, 1955. The report provides details of the sighting, including the reactions and actions taken by various individuals and organizations involved, such as the Air Traffic Control Center, the Operations Officer at Andrews AFB, and the Commanding General's office in the Pentagon. The report also mentions that the processing branch and D&D of CCS/ORS, Hq USAF were contacted, and that the incident was investigated by Lt. Col. Freches, who concluded that the UFO sighting could have been a very rare phenomenon.

CLASSIFICATION: AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FLIGHT 3-H, 4.6023d ATOS 31I-UFOB-6-55 PAGE 2 OF 3 PRIORITY 1

CONTENTS: PREPARING OFFICER'S COMMENTS
1. The mission of the Preparing Officer is that the UFOB sighting of 22 June was in fact the sighting by several observers of a weather balloon being carried along by prevailing winds. However, according to the information of the Preparing Officer, the object sighted was an "unknown" due to the fact that a radar photograph of the object which was released by the Silver Hill Weather Observatory at approximately 30/02/52 due to its classification had not been delivered to this ATIW office as yet.
(1) The observer commented that the approach and disappearance of the object seemed to indicate that it may have been some type of a craft.
(2) The object's altitude could easily have been misinterpreted by the observers as the weather balloon which they observed most of the time, and therefore this could readily have been the direction indicated by the flight path as a result of the wind currents at different altitudes.  
(3) The object suspended in space would have made it virtually impossible of being a weather balloon. However, this could have possibly been the result of the object disappearing from view.
2. In the opinion of all sources when informed of the coincidence at the time of the release, the two objects could well have been one and the same.
3. SOURCES OF INFORMATION:
(a) Statements from observers in Hillcrest Heights, Maryland.
(b) Radar photograph obtained by the Silver Hill Weather Observatory, Washington, D.C.
4. In the absence of any positive radar or other confirmation of the nature of the object sighted, and in view of the overwhelming coincidence surrounding the silver-colored object and the weather balloon, it is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the UFOB sighting of 22 June 1955 was in fact the weather balloon being carried by the prevailing winds.

DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: (The following is a verbatim account)
"On 25 June 1954, at approximately 10:45 pm (EDST), my wife and I were driving on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway near Hillcrest Heights, Maryland, when we sighted an object in the sky which Mrs. Zawalt didn't or couldn't identify. We all went outside to observe it. It was moving from East to West at a fairly high speed. It appeared to be on fire, and gave off a glow which lit up the surrounding area. There were no airplanes flying at this time. The object was over-shadowing and obscuring the stars. After it had passed from East to West, it made a sharp 90 degree turn to the South and disappeared from view. No sound was heard. The object had no wings or tail, and can only be guessed at. It was found or at least resembled a glowing 11-inch disc, which was motionless for approximately 15 to 20 seconds, after which the object disappeared."

III. SOURCE DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
"We had just finished dinner and had begun watching television on the neighbor's TV which we had picked up at the new high power station. All of a sudden, we noticed a bright light in the sky which looked like a star at first but suddenly started moving rapidly. It moved from right to left, up and down, and all around so fast that it was impossible to keep track of it. 
It seemed to be about the size of a small plane and it would disappear and reappear many times. On one occasion, it seemed to divide into two objects, one larger than the other, and the smaller one seemed to chase the larger one for a while. 
During the sighting, the light was a brilliant white and at times seemed to change colors, going from white to orange, blue and red. As suddenly as it started, the light disappeared and we could not locate it again. The sighting lasted approximately 45 minutes."
