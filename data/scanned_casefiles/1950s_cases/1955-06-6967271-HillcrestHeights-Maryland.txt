Education: College Graduate
Qualifications: Good vision and above average-intelligence

II. RELIABILITY: Good

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE had been standing in the driveway of his home when his son brought his attention to a strange object in the sky. The first impression was that it might have come from a landing gear of an aircraft; however, the absence of noise seemed to rule this out as a possibility. The time of the original sighting was 1043 P.M. EDT. A brilliant red ball of light was passing overhead. It was SOURCE's estimate to have been 2000 to 3000 feet. There was no visible outline of the object nor was there any trail of exhaust. There was also no sound of aircraft aloft in the area, which is extremely rare.

Line from Andrews AFB, Hq. to Washington Natl. Airport. It continued on this course until directly over Washington Natl., where it hovered for ten to fifteen seconds. As the object however, its light blinked off for approximately three-seconds, then card back on, calling SOURCE applied 500 to 1000 ft. As the object proceeded now on a southwesterly course, SOURCE called next door for Maj. Curdes to come outside and help identify the object. In then ended that the several times as it rose gradually, disappearing finally into the overcast. The phenomenon was observed for a period of ten minutes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with the Air Traffic Control Center at Washington National Airport revealed that the only information which they had on the UFOB was what had been relayed to them by Maj. Gurnee. They had received no confirmation either from their site or from any surrounding radar installations.

2. The Asst. Operations Officer at Andrews AFB was contacted. Confirmation report negative. The above-referred officer contacted the local ACWI Det,ACA unit, each giving negative reports.

3. Maj. Springer and Capt. Casey at Bolling AFB Operations reported negative confirmation of the June 25 sighting. Capt. Casey helped contact the Flight Service Center at Washington National, which was unable to offer any confirmation.

4. A phone call to Capt.Gray, Asst.Supt.of the Washington Naval Observatory, revealed that no UFOB's had been sighted by his faculty for over a year. Results negative.

5. The Director of the Georgetown University Observatory was contacted but was unable to give confirmation. Their observations on the night of 25 June lasted less than an hour due to a heavy overcast.

6. A check with the Silver Hill Weather Observatory(Hillcrest Heights,Md.), located approximately five blocks from the area of first sighting of the UFOB, produced the following information: Namely, that twice daily, 0900 SST and 2200 SST, weather balloons are released from their station. One of these balloons had been released at about 1045 EST, 25 June 1955, containing a small, bright magnesium light. The ground winds at 1044g EDST were from 340°, at 2000 ft at 020°, at 6000' the wind had shifted to the SW. Such wind conditions could easily have carried the balloon along the approximate path of the unidentified object.

7. The Baltimore Filter Center was contacted but no information could be furnished on the June 25 sighting.

8. The Ground Observer Corps Hdq. in the Pentagon was contacted. Results negative.

9. Both the Processing Branch and D&D of DCS/OPS,Hdq.,USAF were contacted but results were negative.

10. Col. Mason at the Command Post, Hdq.,USAF was called by telephone, but aside from the information which is(a) Curtiss had relayed to him nothing additional had been reported to his office in regard to the June 25 sighting.

11. Finally, the TCS/MATS,Lt.Col. Moody, was interviewed at Andrews AFB. In conversation a copy of his report of the incident to the 4602d AISS Investigating Office, from conversations which he had with the authorities at the Silver Hill Weather Station (approximately, weather and wind conditions at the time of the balloon's release(0645EST,25 June 1955)), Lt.Col. Rhodes concluded that the UFOB sighted could have been this very same balloon.

                                                                     Page 3 of 3 Pages

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that the UFOB sighting of 25 June was in fact the sighting by several observers of a weather balloon being carried aloft through shifting currents of air. It is further opinion of this officer that the balloon sighted by the several observers in Hillcrest Heights, Maryland was the same which was released by the Silver Hill Weather Observatory at approximately 26/0245Z Jul55.

a. The object's general appearance and behavior seen to have been very deceptive to the observers on the ground.

(1) First, the object's apparent speed seemed to rule out all possibility of its being a balloon. However, this could easily have been the deception created by the balloon's low altitude at the time it was first observed.

(2) The object's altitude could easily have been misinterpreted by the observers on the ground since the absence of any sound being emitted from it, in addition to the fact that it was nightfall and the object was suspended in space, would have made it virtually impossible for an observer on the ground to have accurately estimated its altitude.

b. All SOURCES when informed of the coincidence in time of the release of the Silver Hill Observatory balloon and their sighting of UFOB concurred that the two objects could well have been one and the same.

(1) All SOURCES were aware of the nearness of the Silver Hill Observatory to their position in Hillcrest, Maryland.

(2) SOURCES generally acknowledged this Officer's belief that the sporadic action of the object can be explained by the constant shifting of wind currents at various altitudes during its ascent, and that the brilliant light observed on the object could easily have been a glow from the magnesium light attached to the Silver Hill balloon.

(3) The searchlight beam neutralizing phenomenon which was noted in the original TT message was what the Hillcrest Heights observers stated to see, yet in fact it was probably caused by advertising searchlights in the city some 10 miles away. A clicking on and off at the source of light or a sudden power failure at the source might have given the effect of their being neutralized to an observer 10 miles away.

c. In the absence of any positive radar or other confirmation of the nature of the object sighted, and in view of the overwhelming coincidence surrounding the release of the Silver Hill Weather Observatory balloon on the night of 25 June 1955, this Officer concludes that the phenomenon observed was the ascent of the Silver Hill weather balloon.

At approximately 10:15, a neighbor or the [illegible], Mr. [illegible], called his wife to come outside to observe an object in the sky, which Mr. [illegible] couldn't identify. We all went outside and looked. The object was a yellow light in the sky, which was moving from East to West, then SW, and moving very rapidly. It was round or about some 200 feet in diameter when move to the left(SW). There were no airplanes flying at this time. The sky was overcast with a low ceiling. The object seemed to be controlled, because it seemed to hover for awhile and then move. The area and shape can only be guessed at. It was round and a hazy reddish-orange glowing object. I looked at my watch as soon as I stepped outside and it read 10:46. We all observed the object for approximately six minutes, after which time the object disappeared."

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

    "We had just finished dinner and had begun watching television on the evening of 25 June 1955 in my home in Hillcrest Heights, Washington 21,D.C., when our neighbor, Mr. [redacted] knocked on the door and yelled for us to come outside to observe something (a flying object), which we might be able to identify. Myself, Col [redacted] and [redacted] went out. From our position we saw a bright, yellowish-orange object, approximately 70° elevation, traveling at great speed in a zigzag course to the southwest. It stopped and hovered once, then circled and departed in a straight line due west. It appeared to hover in the vicinity of Washington National Airport from our position as it disappeared into the overcast, at about 30° elevation. When it had disappeared, I again checked my watch and it was 10:51 P.M. EDT.

    The object at no time emitted any noise, nor did it change color or intensity. It appeared to have a triangular-shaped balloon attached to the rear-round object the size of a grapefruit. Both the tail cone and the circular part of the light were of the same color and intensity. At no time did this object change color, nor did it appear to get larger or smaller from the time of my first observation until it disappeared into the overcast."
