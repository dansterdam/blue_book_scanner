Here is the text I can read from the document:

0172Z
(-8 = 1737 hrs Local)
i.e. 5:37PM (PST)

[The rest of the text is partially illegible due to poor image quality, but appears to be some kind of communication or report form with location references to California]

Some additional handwritten notes are visible in the top left corner, but they are not clearly legible.
