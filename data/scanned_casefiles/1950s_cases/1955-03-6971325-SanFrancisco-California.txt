The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project Blue Book record card from March 18, 1955, documenting a UFO sighting in San Francisco, California. The text on the record card is as follows:

1. DATE: 18 March 1955
2. LOCATION: San Francisco, California 
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 19/0435Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Aerial Visual
5. COURSE: One
6. SOURCE: Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: twenty seconds
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: One round pinkish-orange object, l' size, held at arms length, crossed the sky from NW to SE. Observer did not see it disappear. Weather was foggy. Sighting at night.
10. CONCLUSIONS: The short sighting time of the UFO and sudden disappearance suggests a turn in the flight path of a jet. No indication authorized.

Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
We were pulling guard duty at the POF at San Francisco S.F. at about 4:20 am. The bright light about the size of the object caught our attention. At about two fifty a. m. one of the air policemen who had the first watch saw a strange object and woke us up. When we looked at it, it looked like a ball of fire about fifteen to twenty feet in diameter. It seemed to just hover there for three or four minutes, then all of a sudden it took off at tremendous speed in an easterly direction. The color seemed to vary from bright yellow to almost reddish. After it took off, we continued our guard duty and told anyone who came along what we had seen. They said, oh yeah, yeah, I saw it too. Evidently it was seen by other people in the area that early morning. I could not give a more detailed explanation if I tried. The light seemed to be about the size of a basketball and we could see no other outline or shape but the bright light. It disappeared in a matter of seconds.

Air Force UFO form continued
Please provide a report of a sighting of an unusual object, which apparently came toward the observer, and then seemed to stand still and rock up and down. The object was silvery in color and seemed to be glowing. Its size was approximately 15 feet in diameter, and its shape was round or circular. The object was observed for about 2 minutes. It disappeared from view in a manner that indicated it was flying away from the observer, and not merely fading from sight. The observer stated that this was a definite sighting of an unusual object, and not merely an illusion or misidentification of a known object. The observer appeared to be sincere and considered the sighting to be of utmost importance.
Very Respectfully,

Other UFOs in "Stack" Formation
A correspondent has reported a UFO sighting very similar to the Norfolk case, almost certainly produced by the mechanism just described.
In the late spring of 1955 a physicist, A.F.Z. was driving west on the highway between Dayton and Yolkima, Washington, in a region of low-lying hills. The time was shortly after dark, the sun had set but there was still a suggestion of light in the west. Suddenly a line of five lights was observed in the western sky, apparently traveling at a distance of four or five miles away, traveling east at high speed, and accelerating as they approached. Flying in a "stack" with the leading saucer on top, the individual saucers were oriented in horizontal planes, but each was tilted somewhat, with the leading edge slightly higher than the trailing edge.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document discussing a sighting of "flying saucers" that occurred.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF
Galley 9--CHE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
Galley 9s--he world of flying saucers follower was slower than and somewhat behind its predecessor so that the entire formation was "like a stack of pancakes" leaning at about a 45-degree angle toward the direction of flight. (As this was to be the clue of that of the Chesapeake Bay UFOs.) The top saucer advanced more rapidly than the bottom ones so that as they flashed through the sky at the left of the observer they appeared to be in single file. Startled, he stopped his car and got out to scan the sky, but the saucers had disappeared. Some fifteen to twenty seconds later a similar formation appeared in the west. As they approached he could see that they were thin, flat disks, glowing with a white light, sharply defined and circular in shape; and apparently fifty to a hundred feet in diameter. As they passed, the stack again spread out into single file. When they were apparently eight to ten miles east, the three lead saucers suddenly accelerated, while the others on the bottom made a sharp turn to the north, as abruptly as balls bouncing off a wall. Concluding that the saucers might be images produced by an airfield beacon shining upward through very thin horizontal clouds, the observer continued to watch. They reappeared again and again, sometimes at the correct interval for an airfield beacon, but sometimes delayed for two or three minutes. To explain their occasional failure to appear on schedule, he reasoned that some very dense, fast-moving, high-altitude clouds must lie in the west between him and the beacon, so that sometimes the light could not penetrate to shine on the assumed stratified layers overhead, and sometimes the appearance of the phenomenon changed.
The top three saucers merged gradually into an indistinct blur, while the bottom two remained sharp and distinct and continued to dart abruptly to the north just before disappearing.
Although the observer was not able to see the very thin layers of cloud overhead that would be required to account for the sharply defined shape of the saucers, he concluded that his explanation was the most reasonable one.

This image contains a hand-drawn sketch of three figures that appear to be humanoid in nature. The figures are depicted as having bulbous heads and slender bodies. The text above the sketch indicates that the image is related to a "creature" sighting that occurred in Loveland, Ohio in March 1955. The sketch is labeled as being "about 4 ft" in size.

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experiences, which might be pertinent.
I was with the B-47 for about 5 years and about 3 years as a special intelligence investigator and have seen many unusual things while in the Air Force, but never anything like this UFO. It was completely different from any type I have witnessed or heard described before. There were no doors or hatches visible and no protruding parts such as wings, propellors or anything else that the B-47 or ordinary aircraft might have. Its silent smooth flight and complete disappearance that the B-47 could not overtake lead me to believe that this UFO or whatever it was, might have been a secret aircraft that the Air Force or Defense Dept. was testing.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
DO: POLICE AT THE BASE (CALIFORNIA ROUTE 185) 
MONTH: FEBRUARY YEAR: 1955
