I was pulling guard duty at the P.O.F. at 2nd Rosales A.F.B. in France. I was on the midnight to eight o'clock shift. At about two fifty A.M. one of the air policemen brought me a thermos of coffee and we sat down to drink it. About ten minutes later this air policeman looked up and told me, Hey look at that pointing to the sky, so I said it's probably an airplane, he responded Hill airplanes don't fly like that (at this point the object was flying up and down like seesaws-rrr) because there's no noise. About two minutes later this object flew in a straight line and curved, toward the north west and stopped all of a sudden in one spot for about fifteen minutes, the red light, changing to pale yellow and started to blink off and on as if signaling. They joked and I became agitated and

was inside a small shack, away quite a while we would peer out of the door and look up hoping it wouldn't be there, but it was still there signaling lets. We really decided to call the air police.

When we did they ridiculed us but we talked them into coming over and they did not as near as their jeep pulled into the driveway then opposite night into the clouds and disappeared the sgt. of the guard called us a couple of nuts and left.

By the morning I told my best friend about it just he satisfied at my story time then I have never mentioned it to anyone for fear of being ridiculed, but under pure this happened it has stuck in my mind. And the reason I write you is in hope that an explanation can be found. I am not an ardent believer of flying process now they call them that I am a little skeptical about this whole thing I must admit it's a heck of an experience.

Other UFOs in "Stack" Formation

A correspondent has reported a UFO sighting very similar to the Norfolk case, almost certainly produced by the mechanism just described.

In the late spring of 1955 a physicist, N., Z. was driving west on the highway between Dayton and Yakima, Washington, in a region of low-lying hills. The time was shortly after dark, the sun had set but there was still a suggestion of light in the west. Suddenly a line of five glowing UFOs appeared in the western sky, apparently three to five miles away, traveling east at high speed, and accelerating as they approached. Flying in a "stack" with the leading saucer on top, the individual saucers were oriented in horizontal planes, but each

follower was lower than and somewhat behind its predecessor so
that the entire formation was "like a stack of pancakes" leaning at
about a 45-degree angle toward the direction of flight. (Note that
this arrangement is the reverse analogue of that of the Chesapeake
Bay UFOs.) The top saucer advanced more rapidly than the bottom
one, so that as they flashed through the sky at the left of the observer
they appeared to be in single file. Startled, he stopped his car and
got out to scan the sky, but the saucers had disappeared. Some
fifteen to twenty seconds later a similar formation appeared in the
west. As they approached he could see that they were thin, flat
disks, glowing with a white light, sharply defined and circular in
shape, and apparently fifty to a hundred feet in diameter. As they
passed, the stack again spread out into single file. When they were
apparently about ten miles east, the three lead saucers suddenly
disappeared, while the two that had been on the bottom made a
sharp turn to the north, as abruptly as balls bouncing off a wall.
Concluding that the saucers might be images produced by an
airfield beacon shining upward through very thin horizontal clouds,
the observer continued to watch. They reappeared again and again,
sometimes at the correct interval for an airfield beacon, but sometimes delaying for two or three minutes. To explain their occasional
failure to appear on schedule, he reasoned that some very dense,
fast-moving, low-lying clouds must lie in the west between him and
the beacon, so that sometimes the light could penetrate to shine
on the assumed stratified layers overhead, and sometimes not. After
twenty minutes or so, the appearance of the phenomenon changed.
The top three saucers merged gradually into an indistinct blur, while
the bottom two remained sharp and distinct and continued to dart
abruptly to the north just before disappearing.
Although the observer was not able to see the very thin layers
of cloud overhead that would be required to account for the sharply
defined shape of the saucers, he concluded that his explanation was
the most reasonable one [10].

JOURNAL HERALD, DAYTON, OHIO, THURSDAY, MARCH 31, 1955

Summer's Near, "Object" Seen
An unidentified and unexplained object appeared over Wright field at Wright-Patterson Air Force base at 10:10 a.m. Tuesday, a civilian reported.

Air Air Force said it found nothing after checking the report.

Theodore Jikutz, chemist at Rosencrans disposal plant, and a technician saw the object.

It was described as having a rectangular shape.

A sharp light, flashing at intervals approximately one second, drew attention of the men. They estimated the object at about five miles away, over the field.

"I first thought I was seeing things," Jikutz said. But he added that the technician saw it too.

The men then got out a stop watch and checked the flashing lights. They added up to approximately 14 in one minute.

The men reported the object stayed in approximately the same place for 15 minutes from the time they first sighted it. They were getting ready to set up a transit to pinpoint the location when it disappeared.

The information was turned over to Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) here for evaluation. ATIC handles all unidentified object reports.
