Mr. [redacted] might relate. Mr. [redacted] advised that he had known Mr. [redacted] all his life and that he believed was of good character and trustworthy, however, he had some doubt about the credibility of information received from [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] stated that [redacted] might be inclined to seek publicity.

He based this on the way [redacted] would greet him whenever they met, which was quite frequently. [redacted] would greet him as if they had not seen each other in months when in fact it may have not been over a day or two since they had spoken to each other. Mr. [redacted] further advised that he did not know just how to express what he meant, but that [redacted] was peculiar in a way and might exaggerate the truth or supplement it through his imagination.

Mr. [redacted] advised that he had known Mrs. [redacted] for many years and believed her to be completely reliable, honest, trustworthy, and that any information she related would be credible.

She seemed to read and think a great deal and then use his imagination to supplement the facts. Mrs. DUNN further stated that she did not wish to imply that anyone of the three (3) persons would make up a complete false-hood or that they were not basically honest, truthful, dependable, and reliable.

11 July 1951

On 10 and 11 July 1951, Sgt. [redacted] who is stationed at the Corona Experimental Radar Site about 18 miles southwest of Corona, New Mexico made the following verbal report to Capt. Dyvad and myself:

About 2230, 9 July 1951 I noticed a red glowing ball of light about the size of a full moon to the west or west southwest of the station low above the horizon. I called the civilian Security Guard, Mr. [redacted] and we both watched it slowly descend for about thirty seconds here it went below the trees. There was an afterglow for another ten seconds. No sound was heard that might have come from the object. Visibility was slightly poor and although some stars could be seen, there were dark clouds over part of the sky. The light was nearly circular in shape and uniform in the red glowing color.
