Mr. WOOD was advised that he had known Mr. GONZALES all his life and that he believed him to be of good character and trustworthy. However, he had been advised that Mr. GONZALES had received some information about the credibility and reliability of information received from some source, which might be inclined to seek publicity.

He passed this on in the way that he would want to know if he were in the same position. For several months when in fact it may not have been over a day or two in reality they spoke to each other, but further advised that he did not know just how to express what he meant, but that it was peculiar in a way and might corroborate the truth through his imagination.

He also advised that he had known Mrs. GONZALES for many years and believed her to be completely reliable, honest, trustworthy, and that any information she related would be credible.

3. On 21 May 1952, Mrs. DELBERT DUNN, Secretary, Chamber of Commerce, Gonzales, Texas, was interviewed and she related substantially the same as Mr. WOOD concerning the honesty, character, and credibility of Mr. and Mrs. GONZALES.

It called the civilian Security Guard, but no one else witnessed it slowly disappear in about 3-5 seconds. There was an after-glow for another ten seconds. No sound was heard that might have come from the object. Visibility was slightly poor and although some stars could be seen, there were dark clouds over part of the sky. The light was nearly circular in shape and uniform in the red glowing color.

Q: Did observer wear glasses, especially polaroid glasses at time of was object viewed through window, or other transparent material?
A: Usually wears glasses - can see further without glasses - was not wearing glasses at the time.

Mr. * * * was seriously interested in "flying saucers" and read all the books and articles he could find on them. He stated that he believed there were such things and contended that they generated their power through magnetic force and also through absorbing energy from the sun. It was his opinion that these objects were from other planets, Mars or Venus, and that they should not think of us from here as being of any consequence. His information was that the occupants of these objects from another planet had to have gears to land in or on, therefore, it was his opinion that it is quite likely they are probably traveling along lower California and that the occupants are probably prospecting.
Mr. * * * was seriously injured in a fire approximately two (2) years ago, and is carrying scars and seriously injuring his hand.

While interviewing Mr. and Mrs. * * * (sic), he was introduced to the writer and when she learned what he (Mr. * * *) was being questioned about, she remarked: "I bet I could see a 'flying saucer' if I went out and looked for one long enough and used my imagination!" (ACESIONED)
