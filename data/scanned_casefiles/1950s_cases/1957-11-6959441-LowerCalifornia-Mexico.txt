COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. Considering the excellent weather conditions and the circumstances surrounding the sighting as well as the physical phenomena involved, SOURCE shared with the objects were "not of this Earth". He shared with Co. Co. the opinion that in all of the expanse of the universe it is possible that other forms of intelligence exist and that they may be well advanced. In technology beyond human comprehension. He assured further that such intelligent beings would attempt to avoid human contact for perhaps a multitude of reasons.

2. He stated that they could not have been any known aerial vehicles (dirigibles, balloons, aircraft, helicopters, missiles, etc.) because he saw the objects clearly and is familiar with airframes of this sort.

3. He did not believe that they were U.S. experimental models because he doubt that flight tests would be conducted with four (4) prototypes at the same time and in uncontrolled areas such as the vicinity in which the sighting was made. He ruled out the possibility of a forced landing of such experimental models because that they could maneuver and could have landed just as easily at a spot not visible from the road.

4. SOURCE ruled out the possibility that the objects belonged to another Earth power attempting to spy on the U.S. by means of these vehicles due to that fact that was nothing important to gain from an investigation at the location of the sighting.

5. SOURCE did not believe that they were experimental models of a foreign nation because nothing would take a chance on an experimental model of such revolutionary design and propulsion crashing where it might reveal all of these advances to another power.

6. He also concluded that attempts by any country to conceal anything as revolutionary as these (over UFO sightings began) would be unsuccessful. "Something is bound to leak out."

7. SOURCE did not believe that the objects were frank reflections in the air caused by last light impressions in the desert sand.

8. He ruled out misinterpretation of other weather phenomena because weather, light, and visibility were excellent at time of sighting.

9. SOURCE stated that the only physical evidence other than the automobile engine had stopped completely. (He failed to check his lights or horn.) He assumed that this was indicative of some form of propulsion for the objects. "What alone makes me believe that they were space ships, because we would have more hint if we were able to do much."

(A certain amount of hesitancy on the part of SOURCE had to be overcome by the investigator to extract SOURCE's reasoning indicated above.)

PAGE 12 OF 12 PAGES

2. SOURCE regretted the fact that he had no film in his camera and that he did not make a closer investigation of the observation on the spot or that he did not note the exact spot of sighting on a road map or mark the spot on the road for later reference.

3. Judging only by the description of the sighting and its circumstances, the Investigator does not believe that the incident was the manifestation of any natural or man-made phenomena.

4. Based again on the same information, it is the investigator's belief that the entire story may be of complete manufacture by SOURCE. Although the latter never showed any signs of "faking".

5. The investigator was able to ascertain that SOURCE was not unfamiliar with science fiction literature of a "high" type. SOURCE did not deny knowledge of such authors as Leinster, Bradbury, Heinlein, Sturgeon, Asimov, etc.

6. SOURCE's motives for possibly manufacturing such a story remain mere conjecture to the investigator.

COMMENTS OF THE APPROVING OFFICER:
1. In the opinion of the Approving Officer, SOURCE's reliability cannot readily be questioned for the following reasons:

a. SOURCE's Commander and Adjutant spoke favorably of SOURCE's ability as a fighter pilot and of his character.

b. The Preparing Officer states: "SOURCE's motives for possibly manufacturing such a story remain mere conjecture to the investigator." The Approving Officer shares this opinion.

2. Therefore, in view of the above, the Approving Officer forwards this sighting as "Unknown".

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

Detachment 10, 1006th AISS                   MISS-UFOB-779-57        PAGE 3 OF 12 PAGES
                                              DLO-UFOB-2-57          PART ONE

I. SOURCE: Joseph F. Long, 1st Lt, USAF, AO 3023640
    Address: 321st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, ADC
             Paine Air Force Base
             Everett, Washington

(Note: SOURCE will be at above address after 18 Jan 58. He is presently
on delay enroute status during a permanent change of station from Newcastle
County Airport, Wilmington, Del, where his former unit, the 977th Fighter-
Interceptor Sq, was de-activated.)

Age: 24

Occupation: 1st Lt, USAF, Interceptor Pilot

Education: 8 Yrs grade school, 1 yrs high school, 1 yrs college including ROTC. SOURCE studied speech and related subjects for subsequent work at TV station or the like.

Qualifications: All-weather instrument school, flying training, qualified in F-94 and T-33.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appeared intelligent, and he was friendly and cooperative. Initially he appeared somewhat nervous, but it is believed that this was due to his uncertainty as to how his information would be received, when it became apparent to him that the interviewer received his information with unbiased interest, he loosened up. He presented his account of the incident without hesitation. He answered all follow-up questions willingly.

One minor inconsequence occurs in the report. SOURCE drew a sketch of the top view of one of the objects. While he probably can't do this to be a top view of the objects as he imagined it (never actually having seen the objects from the top), it would seem more logical had he drawn a bottom view, since he did see the objects passing almost directly above him (50 ft). During the latter part of the interview, while working on SOURCE's narrative description of the incident, his commanding officer and his adjutant were present in the room. Both spoke favorably of SOURCE's ability as a fighter pilot and of his character. His C.O. passed remarks to the effect that he, for one, believed SOURCE, although he himself had never made any UFOB sightings.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was returning to Newcastle County Airport, Del. after completion of USAF Advanced Survival School. Stead AFB, Nev, on 23 Nov 57 in his automobile. At about (0630) he was approximately thirty (30) miles west of THOMAS, Nev., traveling towards LAS VEGAS, Nev. at about eighty (80) mph, when the engine of his car suddenly stopped. Attempts to re-start the engine were unsuccessful, and SOURCE got out of his car to investigate the trouble. Outside the car he heard a steady high-pitched whining noise which drew his attention to four (4) disc-shaped objects which were sitting on the ground about 300 - 400 yards to the right of the highway. These objects were totally unlike any aircraft he had ever seen, and he attempted to get closer for a better look at them. He walked for several minutes until he was within approximately fifty (50) feet west of them. The objects appeared identical and about fifty (50) feet in diameter. They were disc-shaped, emitting their own source of light, which caused them to glow brightly. They were equipped with a translucent dome in the center of the top which was obviously not of the same material as the rest of the craft. The entire body of the objects emitted the light, they did not seem to be dark on the underside. They were equipped with three (3) landing gears each.

Detachment 10, 1006th AISS                    REPORT NO.    AISS-UFOB-779-57
                                               DATE          DIO-UFOB-2-57

that appeared hemispherical in shape, about two (2) feet in diameter, and of some dark material. SOURCE estimated the height of the objects from ground level to the top of the dome to be about ten (10) to fifteen (15) feet.

The objects were equipped with a ring around the outside that was darker than the rest of the craft and was apparently rotating. When SOURCE got to within fifty (50) feet of the nearest object, the hum, which had been steady in the air for some time first observed the objects, increased in pitch to a degree where it almost hurt his ears, and the objects lifted off the ground.

The preliminary years were retraced immediately after takeoff, the objects rose about fifty (50) feet into the air and proceeded slowly (about ten mph) to the north. As SOURCE continued over some small hills about a half (½) mile away, and disappeared behind those hills. As the objects moved directly over SOURCE, he observed no evidence of any smoke, exhaust trail, heat disturbance to the ground or terrain, or any visible outlines of landing gear doors, or any other outlines or openings on the bottom.

The total time of sighting lasted about twenty (20) minutes. After the objects disappeared, SOURCE examined the place where he had first seen them on the ground. There was no evidence that any heat had been present, or that the ground had been disturbed in any other way other than several very small impressions in the sand where the landing gears had obviously rested. These impressions were very shallow and bowl-shaped, triangular in pattern (an equally sided triangle), SOURCE did not seem the distance between the impressions, but estimated it to be about eight (8) to ten (10) feet. After his investigation of the impressions, SOURCE returned to his car and his engine started immediately and ran perfectly. The car SOURCE was driving was a 1956 Chevrolet, and he had not experienced a trouble of similar nature before or after this incident. At the time of sighting, SOURCE had driven from PENA, New, to this point of sighting during the night and had stopped for about two (2) hours in his car between 2000 hrs and 0200 hrs that same day.

SOURCE had had no information or any element of training described his physical condition at time of sighting as excellent. After the sightings, SOURCE proceeded to INDIAN SPRINGS AFB, Nev., where he reported the sighting to the Base Security Officer.

The times of day referred to above are given in Pacific Standard Time. At the time of sighting it was daylight, but the sun was still behind the mountains. The sun was about to rise in front of SOURCE. There were no stars or moonlight. There was no occurrence of the weather was cold, and there was no wind. There were no other witnesses to the observation to the best of SOURCE's knowledge.
