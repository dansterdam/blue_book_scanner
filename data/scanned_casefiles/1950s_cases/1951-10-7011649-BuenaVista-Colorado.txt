SUMMARY:
A greenish-blue brilliant light with an incandescent glow in the form of a tail lasting about 15-20 seconds, traveling north to southeast in a descending curve at an angle of about 300 was seen on/or about 2000 - 2030 hours, 28 October 1951, approximately seven (7) miles from Buena Vista, Colorado.

DATE    20 October 1951    PAGE 1 of 1 PAGES    REPORT NO.

On/or about 2000 - 2030 hours, 20 October 1951, I was at the base of a mountain approximately seven (7) miles south from Buena Vista, Colorado, on a hunting trip and I was sitting in an open facing Northeast. I was watching the sky, somewhat of a very brilliant light, color was greenish-blue. This object approached from the northeast going North to Southwest and in a descending curve. I would estimate the angle to the horizontal at about 20 degrees.

The object stayed within my sight approximately 30 seconds - the brilliant light that is. I wouldn't attempt to estimate the speed. After the passage of the object, the glow appeared to be a trail or immaterial glow in the form of a tail. In was just an incandescent in the sky. Till then it had seemed to change color and seemed to change toward a white - the green bleached out into sort of a white color.

The only deduction I could draw from it, assuming an object had passed by, is that the good at which we were going around 15 to 20 miles an hour, this object changed color as the temperature of the particles changed.

With a visit to the spot I could, I believe, very accurately determine the direction the light was traveling. The direction I gave previously was as near possible as the roads were only tracks along the mountains and we were in and around, and I am not positive of the exact direction I was facing when I saw the object.
