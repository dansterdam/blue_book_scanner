AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Berlin Air Force Base, Texas                                PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

(1) Only one object was observed which was slightly oblong in shape and (or approximately two inches) appeared to be tangent from the sky; the object resembled an extremely bright light, blue-white to yellow-white, that could be described as a condensed vapor trail. Its color was about three times the size of a C-54 aircraft with no distinguishable sound. The object was climbing vertically, visible; the speed of the object was given as two hundred fifty knots per hour in a vertical climb at approximately 7000 to 13,000 feet in five seconds. It then disappeared into the clouds.

(2) The object was sighted at 2105 hours, Central Standard Time, 29 December 1952 and was observed for approximately ten minutes.

(3) Observation was made visually from a B-26 aircraft, altitude 5000 feet, speed 250 knots per hour.

(4) Location of observers was 35° 15' N, 108° 25'W, approximately thirty miles west of Amarillo, Texas and right over Vega, Texas. The object was about eleven o'clock to the left of observers and was about forty miles from them. Object was climbing vertically from about 7000 feet until it went into a vertical climb to 13,000 feet.

(5) The two officers have not previously experienced the observation of an unidentified object such as above; however, each has been in the military service nearly ten years and Captain SOMEK has logged in excess of 1200 hours flying time.

(6) Weather was clear with visibility fifty miles and with wind at twenty-five knots from 240 degrees.

(7) There was no known condition, meteorological or otherwise which would account for the sighting.

(8) There is no known existence of evidence such as fragments, photographs, etc. of the sighting.

(9) At the time of sighting, the two officers radioed the CAA operator at Tucumcari, New Mexico to inform him of their observation; however, this operator, in turn could not detect any such light as reported to him. No other action was taken at that time and no intercept was attempted.

(10) Shortly before the observation was made, an unidentified eastbound aircraft was sighted at an altitude of about 7000 feet.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Statement by Captain WILLIAM T. BOWLEY

On 29 December 1952, I, Captain WILLIAM T. BOWLEY, participated in a routine night navigation cross country flight. In the company of Captain HERBERT W. ANDERS, I departed Perrin AFB, Texas at 1945 CST and flew VFR direct Wichita Falls, RIO Amarillo, 64 Tucumcari, and returned over the same route. I was flying B-25 5855. The west bound flight altitude was 6000 feet. APA at Amarillo was 2057 CST. Approximately 30 nautical miles west of Amarillo on airway green 4 and 15 2105 CST, I observed a white light, about the size and great intensity. Our aircraft was on a heading of 257°, and the object seemed to be at the same altitude. As we drew closer to the light, I noticed it was of that peculiar color which I cannot explain. I began to look for miles from us and moving ahead and parallel to our course. The size of the object estimated at three times the size of a C-54 aircraft. I was watching the light for five minutes. It made a vertical climb of 7000 feet in about five seconds and entered a broken overcast at about 1,000 feet. As 16 entered this overcast I learned a slow to the clouds similar to a search light striking clouds. At this time I contacted the CAA operator at Tucumcari and told him of my observation. Shortly thereafter the light reappeared beneath the clouds. I informed the CAA operator that it was roughly southwest of town, but he was unable to see the object from outside his building. After two minutes the object climbed to the west and disappeared. The weather directly above us was clear, and a full moon was out. Visibility was in excess of fifty miles. To the west there was a thin layer of clouds. At 2123 CST, all altitudes are MSL. We arrived over Tucumcari at 2123 CST, climbed to 7000 feet and combined the flight without further incident. One west bound aircraft was observed at about 7000 feet shortly before we reached Tucumcari.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Statement by Captain HERBERT T. LANGE

On the night of 29 December 1952, Captain WILLIAM T. BOWLEY and I were flying a B-36 AF 5365 on a night navigational flight from Perrin AFB, Texas to Tucumcari, New Mexico and return. At approximately 2215 hours CST as we passed over a beacon on a heading of 237°, altitude 5000 feet, we observed a fairly bright white light ahead and about 25° to the left of our course at an altitude of 7500 feet.

The light remained ahead of us in the same position except that at one time it moved up into the clouds. We were still able to detect its position due to the slow of light it formed in the clouds. At approximately 2115 hours CST we notified the CAA operator at Tucumcari, New Mexico of this unusual light who tried to check our findings but could not verify. At the time the light was called Tucumcari CAA operator the light was below the overcast and shortly thereafter disappeared.
