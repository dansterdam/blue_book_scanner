There are also some handwritten notes on the right side of the document, but they are partially illegible. The visible parts appear to read:
"Probably o/c
reflectry rays
of sitting sun
of its surface"

And at the bottom, there is a partially legible handwritten note that seems to start with "Phls, AIC"
