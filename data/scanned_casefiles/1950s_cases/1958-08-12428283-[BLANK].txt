6. The peak year of the UFO program was 1952 when an average of over 100 reports per month was received. This compares with 10 per month for 1951. The publicity fanfare given to the UFO controversy by the press, publishers, writers and others, reached a high pitch during 1952 and developed a tendency on the part of the public to question the Air Force's handling of the alleged "menace" presented by flying saucers. This came to a climax in late July 1952 during the much publicized Washington Flying Saucer sightings which purported to show flying saucers over the Capitol but which were in reality blips on radar scopes created by quite unusual atmospheric conditions. As a result of this, General Samford (the then Director of Intelligence) a few days after the sighting held a press conference which was televised nationally. His explanation and assurance that the UFO phenomena seen were not of interplanetary origin and did not constitute a threat to the United States were not only received with skepticism but were in fact totally rejected by a large number of writers, so called UFO experts.

7. Following this, General Samford asked the CIA to set up a panel of scientists to review the UFO program and the Air Force's handling of the situation.

8. This panel was formed; it consisted of sixteen of the most distinguished scientists and authorities in the fields of physics, radar, geophysics, atomic energy, astronomy, rockets, guided missiles, scientific and technical intelligence, propulsion and photo interpretation, in the country. Their conclusions were that UFO's (a) held no direct physical threat; (b) were not foreign developments capable of hostile acts on the United States; and (c) were not unknown phenomena requiring the revision of current scientific concepts.

Their recommendations were:

a. First, that the UFO program be de-emphasized because it interfered with the normal operation and mission of many governmental services and agencies, particularly the Air Defense Command, which was compelled to use its radar, communications, air intercept and other units in investigating the overwhelming number of sightings brought to its attention. All to the detriment of its normal mission.

b. Second, that every effort be made to strip the UFO program of its air of mystery in the mind of the public, with the view of restoring the publics confidence in the Air Force and relieving the public of quite unwarranted anxiety.

9. The correlation which exists between the type of treatment given the UFO matter by press and publishers, and the number of reports received, is important and is shown by this chart.

CHART 1 - Frequency of UFO Reports

This chart illustrates the effect of the conservative, scientific approach of Life and Look magazines on UFO reports for that period, in contrast to the newspapers' treatment of the Washington Radar "Flying Saucer" incidents and General Samford's press conference. The New Yorker's "middle-of-the-road" treatment and its effect on sightings is also interesting to note.

10. Under Project BLUE BOOK, it became apparent that if reporting, investigation and analysis procedures were improved, the percentage of unsolved sightings would decrease. Accordingly, the following procedures were adopted:

First, the 4602A Air Intelligence Services Squadron (Headquarters, Air Defense Command) (now 1006th) was directed to carry out all field investigations and preliminary evaluations of UFO sightings. This organization has units deployed throughout the U.S., and they are so highly mobile that they can arrive "on the spot" within a very short time after a UFO report is received. This

supplies the most important of all factors -- timeliness, and
leaves the Air Technical Intelligence Center free to perform
final analysis and evaluation.

Second, the issuance of a special directive (Air Force
Regulation 200-2) which spells out details and responsibilities
of Air Technical Intelligence Center, Air Defense Command, and other
Air Force units reporting investigation and analysis of UFO
sightings. Combining spectrographic and stereo devices.

Third, the use of a special camera known as "Videon camera".
This breaks down the light received from any object into its
components, thus permitting the determination of the elements of
which the object is composed. Seventy-five of these cameras were
placed in radar stations and control towers throughout the U.S.

Fourth, the submission of all UFO data collected since 1947
to scientists in and out of the Air Force to determine whether or not
a trend or pattern existed to indicate the nature or existence of the
so-called flying saucers. This program was handled by the Battelle
Memorial Institute.

11. These four procedures resulted in the following:
The AISS units contributed to the decrease in the number
of unknowns, approximately from 10% to 3%. Next, the new regulation

greatly improved reporting and it emphasized the importance of
cooperation by all Air Force units. Next, the use of Videoon
cameras, while not wholly successful due to the lack of operating
personnel, produced no results to indicate anything but conventional
airborne objects. Finally, the Battelle effort produced Project
BLUE BOOK, Report No. 14 which in October 1955 was declassified by
the Secretary of the Air Force and released in summary by the
Department of Defense. This study, which covered 8 years of
sightings concluded that:

First, there is a total lack of evidence that these unknowns
were inimical or hostile or a threat to the security of the country.

Second, there is a total lack of evidence that these unknowns
were interplanetary space ships.

Third, there is a total lack of evidence that these unknowns
represented technological developments or principles outside the
range of our present-day scientific knowledge.

Fourth, there is a total lack of any physical or material
evidence â€” not a piece - scrap - or a minute fragment of these
so-called "flying saucers" was ever found. It is our belief that
if more immediate, detailed objective observational data could have
been obtained on the "unknowns" most of these too,would have been
satisfactorily explained.
