JET "EXPLODES" CHASING UFO NEAR UTICA, N. Y.: The gamy but saucer­
            phobic press tried putting wits with its readership. They handed the unsus­ 
pecting reader a front page story without the facts, then ( see July 3 New York
Times) presented the facts in a separate story buried in the back pages. Reason:
They feared public reaction to a saucer tragedy, viz: Capt. Mantell. But, wits
didn't pit right with Ted Bloecher and others such as Lester S. Parker of Topeka,
Kansas. They correlated the loose ends:

       Let's review one "end"-- the front page story: A jet fighter returning from a
"scramble" to investigate an "unidentified aircraft", plunged into tiny Walesville
eleven miles southwest of Utica, about 12:30 P.M. , July 2, 1954. The plane
crashed into an auto and two buildings killing four persons.

     The Air Force in Washington announced the F-94-C Starfire had been sent up
on "an active air defense intercept mission." According to the U. P. release
of July 3, "Air Force spokesmen said the cockpit of the plane . . . became un­
bearably hot during the flight and that the pilot ordered his radar observer to
bail out . . . then bailed out himself at 7000 ft."

         According to the A.P. release in New York Times July 3, "The air base ( Griffis
AFB) said, 'that fuel in the burning plane apparently had exploded when the jet
crashed.' They said it had not been determined whether an explosion occurred
while the jet was in the air."

      "Later," according to A.P., "an AF spokesman in Washington said the inter­
cepted plane was one that had failed to file a flight plan with C. A. A. or, one
that drifted off its announced flight path."

      The U. P. and A. P. stories of disaster were essentially true, but because of the
"disaster" angle they designated the pursued object as a "plane" rather than a
UFO. Ted Bloecher, who did some checking, told me that his friend, Ed
Wilkenson, listened to a broadcast which described the incident, thus: "The
jet had successfully contacted the UFO but still could not identify it."

        But Ted Bloecher's real find was in the small item buried in the New York Times'
( July 3) back pages. It reads:

"A silvery, balloon-like object floating high over the Utica area sent residents
rushing to their telephones to make inquiries of newspapers, police and radio
stations.

"The Utica Press estimated that more than 1000 calls about the object jammed
Its switchboard between 6 and 10:00 P.M. It was reported sighted by residents
In a twenty-five mile radius extending from Rome on the west to Frankfort,
east, of Utica.

"Col. Mitton F. Summerfelt commandant of the Air Force Depot at Rome said
the object appeared to be a plastic balloon about 40 ft long and partially deflated.
He theorized that it was making a gradual descent and said that if it still were
In the area tomorrow morning a plane would be sent to investigate.

"A Mohawk Airlines pilot estimated the altitude of the object at about 20,000 ft.
He said he saw a light apparently shining from it."

SUMMARY OF CIRCUMSTANCES

At 1127 Eastern Standard Time (EST), July 2, 1954, F-94C
51-13559 crashed three miles east of Westmoreland (referred
to as the Walesville intersection), New York and was
destroyed. The pilot and radar observer of the aircraft
ejected successfully and were uninjured. However, the air-
craft struck a civilian dwelling and a civilian automobile,
fatally injuring a total of four persons.

The aircraft took off at 11:05 EST on a routine training
mission. An afterburner takeoff was made and engine
operation was normal. The afterburner was shut off at
2,500 feet and level flight was assumed. At the request
of the ground controlled intercept (GCI) site, the mission
of the aircraft was changed to airborne intercept and an
afterburner climb was made to 12,000 feet. A visual sight-
ing of the unidentified aircraft was made at 10,000 feet,
but because of the slow speed of the unidentified aircraft,
the pilot of the F-94C employed dive brakes, flaps and, at
the same time, reduced the throttle to approximately 65 per-
cent rpm. After identifying the C-47 aircraft by tail number,
the pilot turned his attention to a second unidentified air-
craft. The GCI informed the pilot that the second
unidentified aircraft was probably low and letting down for

SPACE-CRAFT LANDING IN CANADA

("interplanetary sabotage with whole planets as the stake is a new concept and one which I feel will grow. So too, with the chain reacting of mineral and metal stock while still in the ground. The nuclear physics has been carefully checked by an authority. Tha facts, and my own speculative thinking about them are quite in line with material given us by G.L. and lately published in Round Robin. I hope the BSR will again scoop the power-and-pelf simians on this." )      - ESS.

This landing is said to have occurred about 5:00 p.m. of July 2, 1954, and was witnessed by a young Canadian miner, Emnio la Sarza, 23, born in Italy. It is the first incident of the kind reported in Canada.

The landing, according to this rather well-authenticated story, took place on the extensive properties of a big Canadian nickel mining company, located at Garson, five miles from Sudbury, Ontario, about 310 miles north of Toronto. This, be it noted, is about 150 miles from Canada's Flying Saucer Research Observatory. I am indebted for details to BSR Assoc. Elder Charles Beck, a Buffalo, N. Y. minister who travels considerably, uses 'saucer' material in his radio broadcasts, and has had various interviews with Washington authorities on this subject.

Immediately after hearing the account of the incident, Elder Beck went to Canada (July 9) and had a four-hour interview with La Sarza. In this he had the fine cooperation of Michael Bolton, reporter for the Sudbury Daily Star. Elder Beck, as is his custom, took his tape recorder along and obtained a taped recorded interview with Ennio. However, right after the talk, Ennio became so disturbed about how the recording might be in violation of certain promises he had made to the authorities, police, RCAF, etc., that he begged to have the recording wiped out. Elder Beck courteously complied in the Holy's presence.

Elder Beck and reporter Bolton then retired to the Daily Star offices, and between them put the story on tape from memory. On the evening of July 11 this tape was broadcast from a Buffalo station, with supplementary comments by Elder Beck. I, in turn, made a recording of the story, which corrects some errors in the press reports and gives the facts as far as they can be ascertained by careful investigation.

La Sarza was busy with a painting job, on the Nickel mine premises, when he noted with surprise an object hurtling down from the skies with "several times the speed of a jet plane". He thought it would crash, but it slowed down and ended by hovering just above the ground. No one else seemed to be around at the time, a pattern that seems to prevail in most alleged saucer landings and contacts. Quite possibly the saucer people see to it that complications do not set in from too many persons being on hand at such times.

So-craft b

The ground or grass, Ennio said, looked scorched underneath under neath where the space craft was poised, but mining officials did not permit the Elder and others to inspect the spot. The 'saucer', Ennio re- lated, was spherical in shape, about 25 feet in diameter, and had a set of protuberances or a circular crown around it. There were rudiments of a landing gear and something like a retractable antenna on top.

Three strange beings emerged from this craft. They were about 15 ft. tall, greenish-blue in color, and the face was a color or combination he had never seen before. Their bodies seemed to glow, and they had a single eye in the center of what passed for a forehead. The beings had six sets of evenly distributed arms and/or hairy legs. The hands were equipped with crablike claws which opened and closed spasmodically. They also were equipped with a natural, twin antenna in the head.

One of the beings started to come toward Ennio, who turned and ran. However, the being sent a sort of hypnotic stare after Ennio that 'froze' him in his tracks, and then spoke to him in a voice that seemed to ad ‑ dress him inside of his head (teleopathy?). The being sternly requested or ordered Ennio to perform some task, the nature of which he has stout ly refused to divulge, even to officialdom. He was emphatic that he would 'rather die' than do what they asked him to do. Anyhow, he passed out from the fright and strain of the orderal, and when he came to, the space craft was gone. He became, subsequently, so terrified over what 'they' had asked or ordered him to do, and the possible consequences from either compliance or refusal, that he has seriously considered the authorities to lock him up in jail as a safety measure. This, in view ‑ of what we know of space-being science, would avail him little.

Because the present nearness of Mars has been so publicized, Ennio was automatically cited as saying that the space craft was from Mars. However, he denies any such statement, and made it clear that he could neither know nor guess where 'they' came from. Careful questioning by the Elder brought out these additional facts. That Ennio had never heard of Adamski , Bethurum, Angelucci et al of 'Saucerdom'. Nor does he read scientifiction. He had not seen any of the current 'space movies'. These facts eliminate most of the source material for a spurious story. In fact, he did not seem to understand what Elder Back meant by the term saucers, except in relation to coffee cups 

There were, of course, the usual hints, especially by officialdom, ‑ as to the question of Ennio's sanity. In fact, in some manner it came about that one or more psychiatrists came from Toronto to quiz Ennio about his experience. Although the mining officials seemed to take a dim view of Ennio's story, this is not abnormal as such matters go. It may be due to the usual official reluctance in the face of the unusual or unknown; fear of unfavorable publicity for their company — or it may have been a cover-up pose in behalf of secrecy, 'security' etc. Certainly, if they really felt there was nothing to it, they would not have refused to let outside investigators inspect the allegedly scorched landing site.

As far as Elder Back and the reporter could ascertain, La Sarza is

regarded in his community as a model citizen with a good record. He had and has nothing whatever to gain by bringing down on his head the pitiless glare of publicity - of an unfavorable kind. Ennio told the Elder that he is fully aware of this situation, and that he may be regarded by some as 'crazy', but that he would not and could not retract his story by one iota. He is a great deal more disturbed by what 'they had asked him to do. He impressed the Elder and the reporter as being intelligent and level-headed, even though he is new concerning what the rest of the world knows as 'saucers'.

Further comment
by Assoc. E.S.S.

La Sarca's story is, to me, a fertile ground for some intuitive speculation and questions. First: we do not know whether the description of the space beings represents their real identity, or something they chose to assume upon landing, for reasons of their own. If these were their fixed characteristics, I would say that they represent a very high and advanced order of insect life from one of our planets or even some remote galactic system. In view of Ennio's reactions, their manner of approach etc., it would seen that 'they' or their intentions were not benign. We do have information and reports that not all space-beings are necessarily friendly toward us. Thus, the Guardians may have the double job of guarding us from the folly of our own atomic insanities, as well as hostile space visitors.

Next, what was it 'they' wanted Ennio to do for them? Since he can't or won't tell, let us fall back on some educated guesses or intutuive reasonings. As a starting point, why would the space beings land on the premises of a nickel-mining company? They would they be interested in a young man who has access to the nickel mine workings? What would he be in a position to do for them?

If the laity will bear with me a little, I will address the physicists, whose attention I will call to the periodic table. You will note that nickel has the atomic number 28. Right next to it we find cobalt, atomic number 27. This sets the stage. Now, 26 percent of natural nickel consists of the isotope Nickel-60. If this is bombarded with neutrons, the Ni-60 will burp out a proton, and the nickel is transformed into nothing less than Cobalt-60; this, if I recall right, has a half-life of about five years and is on par with or superior to Radium in terms of radioactive potency. A spoonful of cobalt-60 is the radioactive equal of all the radium ever produced or in existence in the world today. This is why the cobalt bomb is giving the world a case of king-size jitters.

With the above in mind it is conceivable, in terms of space-being science at least, that the nickel in a nickel mine could be chain reacted into Cobalt-60, right in the ground. All it might need would be some simple form of triggering fuse, i.e., a neutron emitter, to start such a reaction. Although this brings to mind some form of radium-beryllium gadget as a neutron generating triggering fuse; this, fortunately, would hardly do the job, because of the large neutron losses in the nickel impurities.

However, this little difficulty might well be child's play to space- beings science, and they may have a neutron generating fuse gadget that could change a nine-full of nickel into Cobalt-60. All they might need would be some one on this planet 'in the mine. Did the space-beings have La Sarza in mind for this little chore? Would they be avoiding this task themselves because they know that the trigger man would be riddled with radiation before he could take his hand off the gadget in placing it? If this is what the space beings had in mind, did they give up the 
idea when theyloft that area - or, in some other part of the world, at some other niekel mine, will they try again, perhaps with more success? Only 'they' would know what the objective might be in turning a nine- full of nickel into some thousands of tons of cobalt-60. No one knows what that much cobalt-60, in one spot, might do, in terms of radiation unequaled on this planet. A far more sobering thought is this: does cobalt-60 happen to have a critical mass-limit? i.e., would that much of it explode and either trigger-off great earthquakes, or wipe out the hu- man race with atmospheric contamination? Would this be necessarIly a malignant move - or would it be a lesser evil gesture on the part of the Space Guardians,, i.e., to wipe out the human race to forestall our blow~ ing the planet apart with our atomic experiments? From their viewpoint this might amount to killing off the pupils to save the school. Incidentally, those interested in nickel stocks, plus the above pict- ure, can be consoled by the fact that cobalt mine owners are as bad off if not worse, Space beings would undoubtedly know that cobalt-59, the most abundant isotope, can be changed into the dreadful cobalt-60 by ex- posure to neutrons. Each cobalt-59 atom absorbs a neutron, bumps out a gamma ray - and is transmuted into cobalt-60. If space beings can do this while the nickel and cobalt ores are still in the ground, should A it not give us pause? Since I have no power or jurisdiction over such matters, I leave this question to those whose concern it happens to be. And if the above sounds like scientifiction, let me leave you with the thought that actual events, bearing on and related to the coming of the "Saucers", are and will be far stranger than any fiction ever written, - and - NOTES: The single eye - the insect-like appearance: Dr. G.L, describes the first Etherian whom he encountered as being of great stature and as having a single eye in the center of his forehead, And at least one pur- ported etherian communicator described himself as too horrible (accord- ing to our ideas) for us to see. ~ Hostility, etc. Our visitors are of many kinds and races, we cannot judge them properly or measure their thinking by ours. Our protection and best hope is in cooperation with the Guardians - whom our authorities lately (it is said) 'welcomed' "with a ring of bayonets" -- The story of (voluntary) landing at Lake Muroc (Edwards Air Base) tho not 'proyrable' is almost certainly correct in all essentials -- The WrIght Field authorities admit some 700 report- ed sightings per week: now said to be about 800.

**Transcription:**

11. In July, 1954, two Air Force pilots bailed out of 
a F-94C type aircraft, which crashed in Walesville, 
N.Y. (I think) and killed four persons (July 2). Mr. 
Keyhoe mentions that their cockpit became unbearably 
hot as they were chasing a UFO, and they left their 
aircraft as a result of this heat. Although Mr. 
Keyhoe made no mention of fire, this seems a likely 
answer. What is the Air Force Answer?

The July 1954 P-96C type aircraft accident you mentioned is not 
contained in Air Force UFO files.

Case 2.-A jet fighter returning from a "scramble" to 
investigate an "unidentified aircraft," plunged 
into tiny Walesville eleven miles southwest of 
Utica, about 12:30 p.m., July 2, 1954. The plane 
crashed into an auto and two buildings killing 
four persons....The Air Force in Washington 
announced the F-94C Starfire had been sent up on 
"an air defense intercept mission." 
According to the U.P. release of July 3, "Air 
Force spokesman said the cockpit of the plane 
became "unbearably hot" during the flight and 
that the pilot ordered his radar observer to 
bail out, then bailed out himself at 7000 .... 
.... .... Then according to A.P., release in the 
New York Times July 3, "The Griffiss AFB said, 
that fuel in the burning plane apparently had 
exploded when the jet crashed. They said it had 
not been determined whether an explosion occurred 
while the jet was in the air,...also I learned 
that the jet had successfully contacted the UFO
