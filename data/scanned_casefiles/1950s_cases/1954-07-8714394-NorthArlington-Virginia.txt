JET "EXPLODES" CHASING UFO NEAR UTICA, N.Y.: The garny but saucer-phobic press tried pitting wits with its readership. They handed the unsuspecting reader a front page story with four facts, then (see July 3 New York Times) presented the facts in a separate story buried in the back pages. Reason: They feared public reaction to saucer tragedy. viz: Capt. Mantell, But, wits didn't pit right with Ted Bloecher and others such as Lester S. Parker of Topeka, Kansas. They correlated the loose ends.

Let's review one 'end' -- the front page story: A jet fighter returning from a "scramble" to investigate an "unidentified aircraft", plunged into tiny Walesville eleven miles southwest of Utica, about 12:30 P.M., July 2, 1954. The plane crashed into an auto and two buildings killing four persons.

The Air Force in Washington announced the F-94-C Starfire had been sent up on "an active air defense intercept mission." According to the U. P. release of July 3, "Air Force spokesman said the cockpit of the plane ... became unbearably hot during the flight and that the pilot ordered his radar observer to bail out ... then bailed out himself at 7,000 ft."

According to the A.P. release in New York Times July 3, "The air base (Griffiss AFB) said, 'that fuel in the burning plane apparently had exploded when the jet crashed.' They said it had not been determined whether an explosion occurred while the jet was in the air."

"Later," according to A.P., "an AF spokesman in Washington said the intercepted plane was one that had failed to file a flight plan with C.A.A. or, one that drifted off its announced flight path."

The U.P. and A.P. stories of disaster were essentially true, but because of the "disaster" angle they suggested objectively a "plane" rather than a UFO. Ted Bloecher, who did some checking, told me that his friend, Ed Wilkenson, listened to a broadcast which described the incident, thus: "The jet had successfully contacted the UFO but still could not identify it."

But Ted Bloecher's real find was in the small item buried in the New York Times' (July 3) back pages. It reads:

"A silvery, balloon-like object floating high over the Utica area sent residents rushing to their telephones to make inquiries of newspapers, police and radio stations."

The Utica Press estimated that more than 1000 calls about the object jammed its switchboard between 6 and 10:00 P.M. It was reported sighted by residents in a twenty-five mile radius extending from Rome on the west to Frankfort, east, of Utica.

"Col. Milton F. Summerfelt, commandant of the Air Force Depot at Rome said the object appeared to be a plastic balloon about 40 ft. long and partially deflated. He theorized that it was making a gradual descent and said that if it still were in the area tomorrow morning a plane would be sent to investigate."

A Mohawk Airlines pilot estimated the altitude of the object at about 20,000 ft. He said he saw a light apparently shining from it.

SUMMARY OF CIRCUMSTANCES

At 1127 Eastern Standard Time (EST), July 2, 1954, F-94C 51-13569 crashed three miles east of Westmorland (referred to as the Walesville intersection), New York and was destroyed. The pilot and radar observer of the aircraft ejected successfully and were uninjured. However, the aircraft struck a civilian dwelling and a civilian automobile, fatally injuring a total of four persons.

The aircraft took off at 11:05 EST on a routine training mission. An afterburner takeoff was made and engine operation was normal. The afterburner was shut off at 2,500 feet and level flight was assumed. At the request of the ground controlled intercept (GCI) site, the mission of the aircraft was changed to airborne intercept and an afterburner climb was made to 12,000 feet. A visual sighting of the unidentified aircraft was made at 10,000 feet, but because of the slow speed of the unidentified aircraft, the pilot of the F-94C employed dive brakes, flaps and, at the same time, reduced the throttle to approximately 65 percent rpm. After identifying the C-47 aircraft by tail number, the pilot turned his attention to a second unidentified aircraft. The GCI informed the pilot that the second unidentified aircraft was probably low and letting down for

SPACE-CRAFT LANDING IN CANADA

Comment Invited!

("Interplanetary sabotage with whole planets as the stake is a new concept and one which I feel will grow. So too, with the chain reacting of mineral and metal stock while still in the ground. The nuclear physics has been carefully checked by an authority. The facts, and my own speculative thinking about them are quite in line with material given us by G.L. and lately published in Round Robin. I hope the BSR will again scoop the power-and-pell simians on this." - ESS.

This landing is said to have occurred about 5:00 p.m. of July 2, 1954, and was witnessed by a young Canadian miner, Ennio La Sarza, 23, born in Italy. It is the first incident of the kind reported in Canada.

The landing, according to this rather well-authenticated story, took place on the extensive properties of a big Canadian nickel mining company, located at Carson, five miles from Sudbury, Ontario, about 310 miles north of Toronto. This, be it noted, is about 150 miles from canadel's Flying Saucer Research Observatory. I am indeed for details to BSR Assoc. Elder Charles Beck, a Buffalo, N.Y. minister who travels considerably, uses 'saucer' material in his radio broadcasts, and has had various interviews with Washington authorities on this subject.

Immediately after hearing the INS account of the incident, Elder Beck went to Canada (July 9) and had a four-hour interview with La Sarza. In this he had the fine cooperation of Michael Bolton, reporter for the Sudbury Daily Star. Elder Beck, as is his custom, took his tape recorder along and obtained a tape recorded interview with Ennio. However, right after the talk, Ennio became so disturbed about how the recording might be in violation of certain promises he had to make to the authorities, police, RCAF, etc., that he begged to have the recording wiped out. Elder Beck courteously complied in the boy's presence.

Elder Beck and reporter Bolton then retired to the Daily Star offices, and between them put the story on tape from memory. On the evening of July 11 this tape was broadcast from a Buffalo station, with supplementary comments by Elder Beck. I, in turn, made a recording of the story, which corrects some errors in the press reports and gives the facts so far as they can be ascertained by careful investigation.

La Sarza was busy with a painting job, on the Nickel mine premises, when he noted with surprise an object hurtling down from the skies with "several times the speed of a jet plane". He thought it would crash, but it slowed down and ended by hovering just above the ground. No one else seemed to be around at the time, a pattern that seems to prevail in most alleged saucer landings and contacts. Quite possibly the saucer people see to it that complications do not set in from too many persons being on hand at such times.

So-craft b

The ground or grass, Ennio said, looked scorched underneath underneath where the space craft was raised, but mining officials did not permit the Elder and others to inspect the spot. The 'saucer', Ennio related, was spherical in shape, about 25 feet in diameter, and had a set of porthole or equivalent around it. There were midlands of a landing gear and something like a retractable antenna on top.

Three strange beings emerged from this craft. They were about 13 ft. tall, greenish-blue in color, and the face was a color or combination he had never seen before. Their bodies seemed to glow, and they had a single eye in the center of what passed for a forehead. The beings had six sets of evenly distributed arms and/or hairy legs. The 'hands' were equipped with crablike claws which opened and closed spasmodically. They also were equipped with a natural, twin antenna in the head.

One of the beings started to come toward Ennio, who turned and ran. However, the being sent a sort of hypnotic stare after Ennio that 'froze' him in his tracks, and then spoke to him in a voice that seemed to address him inside of his head 'telepathy'. The being sternly requested or ordered Ennio to perform some task, the nature of which he stoutly refused to divulge, even to officialdom. He was emphatic that he would rather die! than do what they asked him to do. Anyway, he passed out from the fright and strain of the ordeal, and when he came to, the space craft was gone. He became, subsequently, so terrified over 'what they' had asked or ordered him to do, and the possible consequences from other complications or refusal, that he seriously considered the authorities to lock him up in jail as a safety measure. This, in view of what he knew of space-being science, would avail him little.

Because the present nearness of Mars has been so publicised, Ennio was automatically quoted as saying that the space craft was from Mars. Notwithstanding, such statements, and made 13 clear that he could neither know nor guess where 'they' came from. Careful questioning by the Elder brought out these additional facts. That Ennio had never heard of Adamski, Bethuram, Angelucci et al, of 'Saucerdom'. Nor does he read scientific fiction. He had not seen any of the current 'space movies'. These facts eliminate most of the source material for a spurious story. In fact, he did not seem to understand what Elder Beck meant by the term 'saucer', except in relation to coffee cups.

There were, of course, the usual hints, especially by officialdom, as to the question of Ennio's sanity. In fact, in some manner it came about that one or more psychiatrists came from Toronto to quiz Ennio about his experience. Although the mining officials seemed to take a dim view of Ennio's story, this is not abnormal as such matters go. It may be due to the usual official reluctance in the face of the unusual or unknown; fear of unfavorable publicity for their company - or it may have been a cover-up pose in behalf of secrecy, 'security' etc. Certainly, if they really felt there was nothing to it, they would not have refused to let outside investigators inspect the allegedly scorched landing site.

As far as Elder Beck and the reporter could ascertain, La Sarza is

regarded in his community as a model citizen with a good record. He had and has nothing whatever to gain by bringing down on his head the pit-less glare of publicity - of an unfavorable kind. Ennio told the Elder that he is fully aware of this situation, and that he may be regarded by some as 'crazy', but that he would not and could not retract his story by one iota. He is a great deal more disturbed by what 'they' had asked him to do. He impressed the Elder and the reporters as being intelligent and level-headed, even though he is naive concerning what the rest of the world knows as 'saucers.'

Further comment
by Assoc. B.S.S.:

La Sarza's story is, to me, a fertile ground for some intuitive speculation and questions. First: we do not know whether the description of the space beings represents their real identity, or something they chose as - and would seem - their reason of their own. In these were their fixed characteristics, I would say that they represent a very high and advanced order of insect life from one of our planets or even some remote galactic system. In view of Ennio's reactions, their manner of approach, etc., it would seem that 'they' their intentions were not benign. We do have information and reports that not all space-beings are necessarily friendly toward us. Thus, the Guardians may have the double job of guarding us from the folly of our own atomic insanities, as well as hostile space visitors.

Next, what was it 'they' wanted Ennio to do for them? Since he can't or won't tell, let us fall back on some educated guesses or intuitive reasoning. As a starting point, why would the space beings land on the promises of a nickel mining company? Why would they be interested in a young man who has access to the nickel mine workings? What would he be in a position to do for them?

If the last will bear with me a little, I will address the physicist, who will next to the periodic table. You will note that nickel has the atomic number 28. Right next to it we find cobalt, atomic number 27. This sets the stage. Now, 26 percent of natural nickel consists of the isotope Nickel-60. If this is bombarded with neutrons, the Ni-60 will turn out a proton, and the nickel is transformed into nothing less than - Cobalt-60; which, if I recall right, has a half-life of about five years and is on par with or superior to Radium in terms of radioactive potency. A spoonful of Cobalt-60 is the radioactive equal of all the radium ever produced or existing in the world today. This is why the cobalt bomb is giving the world a case of king-size jitters.

With the above in mind it is conceivable, in terms of space-being science as I see it, that the nickel, in a nickel mine could be chain reacted into Cobalt-60, right in the ground. All it might need would be some simple form of triggering fuse. I.e., a neutron generator, to start such a reaction. Although this brings to mind some form of radium-beryllium gadget as a neutron generating triggering fuse; this, fortunately, would hardly do the job, because of the large neutron losses in the medical impurities.

However, this little difficulty might well be child's play to space-being science, and they may have a neutron renaming fuse gadget that could change a mine-full of nickel into Cobalt-60. All they might need would be someone to plant it in the mine. Did the space-beings have a Sarza in mind for this little chore? Would they be avoiding this task themselves because they know that the trigger man would be riddled with radiation before he could take his hand off the gadget in placing it?

If this is what the space beings had in mind, did they give up the idea when they left that area - or, in some other part of the world, at some other nickel mine, will they try again, perhaps with more success? Only they would know what the objective might be in turning a mine - all of nickel into some thousand of tons of cobalt-60. No one knows what that much cobalt-60. in one spot, might do, in terms of radiation equivalent. As far more sobering thought is this: does cobalt-60 happen to have a critical mass-limit i.e., would that much of it explode and other trigger-craft areas catastrophes, or ripe out the human race with atmospheric contamination? Would this be necessarily a militant move - or would it be a lesser evil assure on the part of the Space Guardians, i.e., to wipe out the human race to forestall our blowing the planet apart with our atomic experiments? From their viewpoint this might amount to killing off the pupils to save the school.

Incidentally, those interested in nickel stocks, plus the above picture, can be consoled by the fact that cobalt mine owners are as bad off if not worse. Space beings would undoubtedly know that cobalt-59, the most abundant isotope, can be changed into the dreadful cobalt-60 by exposure to neutrons. Each cobalt-59 atom absorbs a neutron, burps out a gamma ray - and is transmuted into cobalt-60. If space beings can do this while the nickel and cobalt ores are still in the ground, should it not give us pause? Since I have no power or jurisdiction over such matters, I leave this question to those who can be. And if the above sounds like scientificfiction, let me leave you with the thought that actual events, bearing on and related to the coming of the "Saucers", are and will be far stranger than any fiction ever written.

NOTES: The single eye -- the insect-like appearance: Dr. G.L. describes the first Etherian from the encounter as being of great stature and having a single eye in the center of his forehead. And at least one purported etherian communication decoder held himself as too terrible (according to our ideas) for us to see. -- Hostility, etc. Our visitors are of many kinds and races. We cannot judge them properly or measure their thinking by ours. Our protection and best hope is in cooperation with the Guardians - whom our authorities lately (it is said) 'welcomed' with a ring of paranoia! -- The story of (voluntary) landings at Lake Muroc (Edwards Air Base) the not improbable is almost certainly correct in all essentials. -- The Wright Field authorities admit some 700 reported sightings per week; now said to be about 800.

*ULY 1, 1954 * WALESVILLE, NEW YORK * (KEYHO-1955 P 175) * WITNESS:
A1' \ OON AN F-94 STARFIRE JET WAS SCRAMBLED FROM GRIFFITH AIR FORCE BASE TO
CHECK ON AN UNKNOWN NEAR UTICA, NEW YORK. WHEN THE STRANGE BLIP FIRST SHOWED
ON AIR DEFENSE RADARSCOPES, THE USUAL SWIFT CHECK HAD BEEN MADE. BUT NO
AIRCRAFT WAS SCHEDULED TO BE AT THAT POINT. GUIDED BY GROUND CONTROL, THE
PILOT CLIMBED STEEPLY WHILE HIS RADAR OBSERVER WATCHED THE REAR COCKPIT SCOPE
BY NOW THE PILOT COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE UNKNOWN -- A STRANGE GLEAMING OBJECT
MOVING SWIFTLY ABOVE PULLING INTO A TIGHT CLIMBING TURN. HE STARTED TO CLOSE
THE GAP.

AT THE SAME TIME HIS RADAR OBSERVER STARTED TO CALL THE UNKNOWN. THERE WAS
NO RESPONSE.

UNTIL THAT MOMENT THE STARFIRE-S JET ENGINE HAD BEEN WORKING PERFECTLY.
SUDDENLY, AS THE PLANE STREAKED TOWARD THE UFO, A WAVE OF HEAT MYSTERIOUSLY
FILLED THE COCKPIT. IT WAS LIKE THE BLAST OF A FURNACE. HALF DAZED, THE
PILOT RAN HIS EYES OVER THE INSTRUMENTS. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF TROUBLE, BUT
THE STIFLING HEAT WAS INCREASING EACH SECOND.

FRANTICALLY HE LOOKED AROUND. THE RADAR OFFICER'S FACE WAS A BLUR IN THE
WAVES OF HEAT. AT ANY MOMENT IT SEEMED THE WHOLE PLANE MIGHT BURST INTO
FLAMES.

*BAIL OUT -- BAIL OUT* HE SHOUTED.
HE JETTISONED HIS CANOPY AND SEIZED THE EJECTION LEVER. HE FELT THE JET
JUMP AS THE RADARMAN BAILED OUT. HALF BLINDED BY SWEAT, HE GOT A GLIMPSE
THE UNKNOWN OBJECT. AS F-94 HURTLED OVER BOND. THE JET WAS PULLING A FINAL
HE PULLED THE EJECTION LEVER AND WAS HURLED OUT OF THE COCKPIT.

MOMENTS LATER HIS SENSES STILL BLURRED, HE SAW THE RADARMAN'S PARACHUTE
BELOW HIM. LOOKING BACK AT THE F-94, HE GROANED. THE JET WAS PLUNGING
STRAIGHT INTO THE VILLAGE OF WALESVILLE, NEW YORK. AS HE WATCHED, HORRIFIED,
IT CRASHED INTO THE HEART OF THE TOWN AND BURST INTO FLAMES.

AFTER THE HEADLONG PLUNGE, THE F-94 STRUCK TWO BUILDINGS AND CAREENED INTO
A CAR. FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED, TWO OF THEM CHILDREN, AND ANOTHER WAS
SERIOUSLY INJURED. AS SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE, GRIFFITH FIELD OFFICERS LOCATED
THE TWO AIRMEN AND PIECED OUT THE STRANGE STORY. STILL DAZED, NEITHER MAN
COULD ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE UNKNOWN OBJECT, NOR COULD THEY EXPLAIN THE
SUDDEN MYSTERIOUS HEAT WHICH HAD FORCED THEM TO BAIL OUT.

11. In July, 1954, two Air Force pilots balled out of
a F-94B type aircraft, which crashed in Walesville, N. Y. (I think) and killed four persons (July 2). Mr.
Keyhoe mentions that their cockpit became unbearably
hot as they were chasing a UFO, and they left their
aircraft as a result of this heat. Although Mr.
Keyhoe made no mention of fire, this seems a likely
answer. What is the Air Force Answer?

The July 1954 F-94B type aircraft accident you mentioned is not
contained in Air Force UFO files.

Case 2. A jet fighter returning from a "scramble" to
investigate an "unidentified aircraft," piloted
into the Walesville eleven miles southwest of
Utica, about 12:50 p.m. July 2, 1954. The plane
crashed into an auto and two buildings killing
four persons. The Air Force in Washington
announced the F-94B Starfire had been sent up on

According to the U.S. release of July 3, "Air
Force spokesman said the cockpit of the plane
became 'unbearably hot' during the flight and
that the pilot ordered his main chores so
bail out, then bailed out himself at 7000 ft."
*** Then according to A.P. release in the
New York Times July 3, "The Griffis AFB said,
that such an unidentified plane apparently had
exploded when the jet crashed. They said it had
not been determined whether an explosion occurred
while the jet was in the air....also I learned
that the jet had apparently contacted too UFO
but still could not identify it.*** Mohawk
