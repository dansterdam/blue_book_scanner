AT SPECIAL DEPOT, BOX 310, MAYWOOD, CALIF.

17 March 1954

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects Information

TO: Director, Special Investigations
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D. C.

1. SYNOPSIS: [Redacted text]
Van Nuys, California, reported an instance of having seen a flying object.

2. DETAILS: Mr. [Redacted text] called at this office on 23 February and advised
Van Nuys, California, that he wished to report an instance of having seen a flying saucer.

3. Mr. [Redacted text], who said he was an Air Force pilot during the
war, advised that he, his wife, and others were returning to their
home at approximately 2300 hours on 13 February 1954. He said he was
driving along a country road in the Van Nuys area on a clear night and
suddenly while completely stopped, he first saw a strange object moving
as a flying saucer. He said he called to his wife and noticed that
with him she also observed the object. They were then Marine Corps pilots, and the wife was
in the, while driving, noticed the object. The group said that
they heard him call out the object and saw the same.

4. [Redacted text] said the object he saw was moving cautiously
at a very slow speed with what he described as a silvery-white disc-like
object traveling in a very high and of great [illegible text]. And his wife came into
the room in time to see the object traveling over the area. She said
it disappeared, and said his wife exclaimed, "There comes another one."
All of them then observed a second object approaching from the north.
This object appeared to be roughly 1/2 to 3/4 miles from the road and from them
in three complete circles over the area and disappeared to the east.

Object.

5. [Redacted] said his estimates of altitude, speed, and size
were pure estimates as he had nothing but his own sense of depth perception to judge those distances. He said the object was crystal clear,
bright, metallic, and there was no cloud cover. He estimated that
the sound object was at an altitude of approximately 4,000 to 5,500
feet; that while it was descending, it was moving in approximately
3,000 mile per hour chain 15 to 50 to 15 miles per hour and that
as it disappeared toward the west, it was traveling at a much higher
rate of speed.

That it was within range would mean he could have only had visual
sound it may have emitted. He said the object was luminous, readily
in the center, with that he described as an electric-blue luminosity
at the edges, which seemed to flash in a white or a luminous way.
Also said that he had the impression which he could not define
that the object was in some manner transparent. He said he seemed to
be looking into rather than at the object. He said the object was
call in shape and could not estimate as to its thickness.

He said the nearest job most have been in all view of the entire group
for 15 to 20 minutes and that he could not estimate its size, height,
size, being at a quite while they were still observing it. He said
that as it disappeared toward the west, they observed a jet aircraft
at a lower altitude approximately then the object.

6. [Redacted] said that he and [Redacted] had discussed the object
at length and had 11 to 12 minutes viewing time with the object. They
were approximately 2,600 meters both had some very altered aerial perspective
so said from film. He said he was making this observation from a
car somewhere in his own neighborhood while the sky was quite clear.

7. [Redacted] He states will be taken by this district. A copy
of this [Redacted] is being made available to the Air Technical Intelligence
Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
