11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Letter containing observation of object in 1957 went to Dr Hynek.

COMMENTS: This report was submitted to Dr Hynek after slight delay, and while no plausible explanation is readily available to explain the sighting, it does not seem realistic to include a case as UNIDENTIFIED without the opportunity to investigate the sighting with it still fresh in the mind of the observer.

5384 Olde Stage Road
Boulder, Colorado
October 14, 1964

Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Mr. Hynek,

Certainly I remember you and our discussions concerning flying objects. More specifically, our discussion concerning the unusual craft that I observed at my ranch in July 1957. It was either the 27th or 29th of July.

I will relate the details as best as I can recall. I am no artist, but I hope the enclosed sketch will suffice for your purposes. Should you need greater detail perhaps a professional artist could give a better rendering.

In answer to the questions in the third paragraph of your letter: No, I have not come to any further conclusions as to what the craft was. No natural explanation has come to mind, but neither have I come to any unnatural explanation. In short the observation remains unchanged in so far as I can remember. From neither until now have I seen nothing that even faintly resembled the craft. Neither have I heard of any person in this area who has had a similar experience.

The incident is still quite clear in my mind. I am sure that I saw a craft of a manufactured nature(not a naturally occurring phenomena). The craft made no noticeable sound. It did not make any visible air disturbance( vapor trails, smoke, flame, etc.). At no time did I see any figures resembling living creatures of any type, tho at the time I assumed it to be piloted, probably by members of our Air Force.

At the time of the sighting I was raking hay south of my farm house which is located approximately six miles west of Longmont, Colorado. The time of day was early morning. The sun had barely risen and the countryside was a gold is tone. I observed the craft(object) approaching high in the sky to the SSE. At first I thought that I was about to see a meteor or the ground. I stared in amazement as the object stopped in midair with a rather abrupt pressure type halt. The craft was then positioned on a line of sight between myself and a promontory to the NNE called "Rabbit Hill". The craft maintained sort of a rocking motion, such as a maple leaf makes while falling. The craft however remained suspended where it had stopped.

I stopped the tractor and got off to watch. During the ten minutes or so that I watched the craft I could see nothing else happening.


- page 12 -

Here is the text from the document:

The craft rose vertically several hundred feet in the air, tilted, and accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed in an arc to the south southwest.

The craft was apparently constructed of a very shiny material which reminded me of blue glacier ice. The top of the craft resembled a honeycomb. The hexagonal compartments partly filled with a bright shiny liquid like substance which made me think of mercury. In spite of the honeycomb appearance the top of the craft appeared to be smooth, as if it were covered with some transparent material such as saran-wrap.

Around the midsection was a band like a scalloped wedding band. The scallops were of a darker burnished color, much darker than the rest of the band.

The bottom of the craft was also made of a smooth silver looking metal except for three or four kidney shape designs. These designs were also burnished and appeared darker than the rest of the bottom, but not as dark as the scallops at midsection. I could see the bottom of the craft only at such time as it tipped toward me and thus find it rather difficult to sketch.

I estimate the altitude to have been 400 feet above my position, perhaps less. Distance about one-half mile. Diameter estimated 150-200 feet. Vertical one-fifth of diameter.

Second sighting was two weeks or so later. The craft did not stay so long, nor as I remember come so low. It left in the same direction, SSW.

I will look forward to visiting with you on your next trip to Boulder. Also I would be interested in what further information you might have concerning other sightings. Could I be of help in this area in the future?

Sincerely you[r signature is blacked out]

There is no legible text on this page. The image contains two hand-drawn sketches of what appears to be a UFO or flying saucer-like object. The top sketch shows a detailed, honeycomb-textured oval shape, while the bottom sketch shows a similar oval shape with less detailed internal features.


- page 14 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch of an oval or elongated object with curved internal lines, resembling a cross-section or diagram of some kind. The sketch is drawn in black ink or pencil on a white background.


- page 15 -

The only text visible in this image is a small notation "5" with an arrow at the top left of the page. The image appears to be a hand-drawn or traced sketch of an elongated oval or seed-like object with a textured, segmented surface, positioned in the upper portion of an otherwise blank white page.


- page 16 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image contains two hand-drawn sketches of what appear to be UFO or flying saucer-like objects - one is a simple oval shape viewed from above, and the other is a more detailed oval shape with a textured or segmented surface.


- page 17 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch of an oval or bean-shaped object with curved internal lines, resembling a stylized organic form or possibly a cross-section of something. The sketch is in black and white, drawn on a white background.


- page 18 -

There is very little text on this page. At the top left corner, there appears to be a small notation "Fp" or "Tp", but it is quite faint and difficult to read with complete certainty.

The page contains a detailed line drawing of what appears to be an elongated oval or seed-like shape with a segmented or cellular internal structure. The drawing is positioned on the left side of the otherwise blank white page.
