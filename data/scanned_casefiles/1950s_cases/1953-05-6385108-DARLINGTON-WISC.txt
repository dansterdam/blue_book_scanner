RECENT AUSTRALIAN SIGHTINGS

Mackay, North Queensland May 17,1953

Captain B.Jones an A.N.A. pilot, reported by radio that a strange object like a lighted glass dome was manoeuvring around his plane just south of the city. At 6:08 p.m.he reported to CIVIL AVIATION Department Control Tower at Mackay, the object manoeuvred around, his plane a DC3 airliner, then crossed his path and disappeared west, travelling fast. This happened on May 10.

A check with the control tower at the airport showed that there were no other aircraft in the vicinity. Mr. W. Overall, who was in charge of the control tower, said he saw the light apparently climbing from about 4/00 or 5000ft. west at a terrific rate, until it vanished, and Captain Jones who trailed it under observation then, said it crossed his path again near Freshwater Point.

Frank Hines a radio operator, saw it again at 3 am the following morning at first as a light to seaward. There were no planes about he said, and puzzled, he switched off the lights in the radio room in order to see it better. The object then shot upward at terrific speed, and vanished.

Captain Jones said that he and his second pilot had watched the object for about five minutes. There was no possibility, he added, (due the course of a radio broadcast) that it could have been a meteorite. The object climbed and dived "yet not erratically" and it's speed had varied between 200 and 700 M.P.H. whilst being viewed. Captain Jones said the object did not emit a vapour or sparks.

Brisbane May 18,
Rockhampton's meteorological officer while plotting the course
of a balloon with a theodolite, spotted a bright crescent shaped object
in the morning sky. It appeared to be moving in a southerly direction.
An airline pilot, Capt.G. Hitchcock also viewed it through the instrument and with the naked eye. It gave the observer the impression
that it was suspended in space. It was also glittering and reflecting
the early morning sunlight.

Melbourne, Australia

Melbourne May 19 1953
A group of people at surrey hills yesterday reported seeing a four minute display by a rocket-like ship high in the sky. It appeared to be 100 ft. long; the sun shone brilliantly off it's sides.
A Melbourne astronomer said that the object could not of been a meteor; it is impossible to account for over the phenomenon or the objects that fly about it.

OBJECTS HAD BEEN SIGHTED IN THE CLOSE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE FOLLOWING AUSTRALIAN AERORDROMES DURING MAY 1953 - MACKAY, ESSENDON, COBURG PARK, AND KINGAROY.

About 8 watts 120 i am now 121 I was living Dr. Sullivan, Indiana. My father and I were sitting on the front porch near his went into the back lot as William and Nellie were going up and were sitting. There was a big sky and it was shaped like a tear drop and was nothing small. It was very fast.

The surface was smooth, except for a small tip to be a ridge to the upper half of the surface.

Hydrographic Bulletin

METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers wt meteors. Mariners reporting observations of these both... are greatly assisting in this work. It is desired to have the Greenwich time and point of appearance and disappearance as accurate as possible, either by bearing and altitude, or by relation to fixed stars, or both.

Complete observations on long-enduring trains and their direction of drift are of special importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.

NORTH ATLANTIC

Mr. C. M. Torgersen aboard the American SS. Marion Lykes, Capt. W. E. Alley, Master, reports that on May 24, 1953, at 0735 G. M. T., in lat. 27°27' N., lon. 71°37' W. a bright blue-green meteor was observed near the star Dubhe. The meteor dropped vertically leaving a blue-green to red colored trail which spread out in fan shape, and disappeared in an intense flaring red flash after traversing 11° arc.
