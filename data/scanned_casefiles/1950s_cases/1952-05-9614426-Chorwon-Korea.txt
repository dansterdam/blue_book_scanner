AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Det 1, 600Eth AISS, APO 970 22-93 1 June 1952
STATEMENT:
On the morning of 31 May 1952, about 0900 hours, the guard at Post #6 called me by first telephone and called me to investigate a sighting of a unidentified aerial object in the sky North-East of my position. At this time I was on guard duty at Post #4. It seemed that the sighting was at first telephoned in and called my attention to a bright object in the sky at approximately 2000 feet above sea-level in elevation. The object stopped falling at about 2000 feet and went straight back up to about 3000 to 4000 feet. It started its fall from approximately 3000 to 4000 feet. The object started to head toward the East for about one half mile, then it stopped and reversed its course and headed back to the Northeast in a smooth flight at a speed of about 100 to 150 miles per hour. Then it reversed its direction again in a backward motion and started to climb at a 45 degree angle away from my position. As it headed away it picked up speed in a jerking motion and then faded from sight. The facts stated in this statement are all true to the best of my knowledge.

STATEMENT:

On the morning of 31 May 1952 I was standing guard duty when I heard a jet in the North. It had a pulsating sound, like it was idling. I couldn't see anything at first but in a few seconds a small light appeared at about 3500 feet. I thought a helicopter was hovering there with a light on one side and had turned that side to me. The light began growing at a very rapid rate and started getting larger. As it got larger it took on a glow. It stopped getting larger at about 2600 feet altitude and it took the form of a disc.

The center was duller in color in respect with the rim which was much brighter.

The object started moving to the East. It seemed to me to be moving with short jerky movements. It moved a ways and changed direction. The change seemed to be instantaneous. It started moving West but not as far as the point from where it had first started moving to the East. Again its direction changed and again the change appeared to be instantaneous. It started heading East again. It was climbing at an angle of approximately 25 degrees. It traveled East for a while and started climbing into the haze at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. It kept climbing until I could no longer see it, or rather it just faded out.

18 May 1952 Lakewood, Ohio ASTRO METEOR)

August 1, 1952

Operation Bluebook
Air Technical Intelligence Center
U.S. Department of the USAF
Dayton, Ohio
Attention: Captain E. J. Ruppelt

Gentlemen:

For some time, I have personally been deeply interested in the problem of unidentified flying objects. As you know, a series of these objects were reported by a group of us interested in this problem on November 8. Our sighting and observations were of the nature of the extra-terrestrial research organization. Since that time, they have continued to grow in frequency and scope.

As a result of the limited research we have been able to undertake, we have been able to accumulate some definite reports of unidentified objects that are or may be flying scour category and not in operation Bluebook files. In addition, we have received reports from our investigators covering 70 such objects, most of which do not seem to have been covered prior to the present time.

These objects, as you are presently investigating, comprise a sightings date from September 16, 1952.

To give an example of the type of reports we regard as reliable and which would like to give the following, which may or may not be in Air Force files:

At 2:25 p.m. 'Eastern daylight time' on May 18, 1952 in Lakewood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, a woman reported that the sky was a beautiful blue without a cloud in sight. Upon looking out her picture window, she saw a white, round, solid-appearing object in our airspace. The object hovered motionless for several minutes, then shot straight up at a tremendous speed and disappeared. The entire observation lasted about 45 seconds.

- page 8 -

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting report from Project Blue Book, dated 1952. The report describes the sighting details, including a description of the object observed by the witness. There are also some calculations and measurements provided, likely to attempt to determine the size and distance of the observed object.

Suddenly Mrs. ________ who was four hours of receiving her Master's degree, pointed to the sky just above our house. She described an arc with her finger before her eyes, which appeared most natural under the circumstances. She said to say- that was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. My attention was, of course, immediately aroused, and without saying a word I followed her gaze up into the sky. There hung, suspended in the air, an object that appeared to be disc-shaped and definitely a thing apart from any ordinary craft.

Mrs. ________ was quite skeptical of previous reports. Why she had phenomena immediately called down apparently one equipment for my eyes, was outside but by that time the object had disappeared.

I immediately began noting the time and date and calculations based upon Mrs. ________ observations. The following represents the data gathered and calculations:

SIZE OF OBJECT = 100' DIAM. 
SIZE OF DIME = 45 " 
DISTANCE TO DIME = 22'
SIZE OF OBJECT/SIZE OF DIME = DISTANCE TO OBJECT/DISTANCE TO DIME
100'/45" = DISTANCE TO OBJECT/22'
DISTANCE TO OBJECT = 2312' OR 797'

From the data gathered it is possible to calculate the approximate distance of the object, as follows:

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old document containing technical calculations and information related to a UFO sighting. 

Text from the document:

CALCULATIONS (CONT.)

FIG. 1
ALTITUDE = a
CA = b = a 
DISTANCE TO OBJECT = c = 5312/737' = a
a2 - c2 = 2a2 = 5312/737' 
a = 3756'/563.5'

y = SPEED = 5312' PER 2 SECONDS = 2656'
y = 3.656' PER SECOND
y = 218.10 MPH
y = 271 MPH

FIG. 2
The calculated speed is 218.0 mph, assuming that the object in the distance was 5312 feet in diameter - a commonly acceptable altitude. The distance to the object would be 3756 feet. The diameter of the object was 30 feet. So, the object was only 30 feet in diameter but the distance from the observer was 3756 feet, and the altitude 563.5 feet. According to this data, the object was traveling at 271 mph at an altitude of only 563.5 feet. In my mind this report based on eyewitness testimony seems to prove that there are some reports that cannot be explained. While the most of the unexplained reports may not prove the existence of visitants from other planets, this particular case seems to point in that direction.

In my mind this report, based on eyewitness testimony, seems to prove that there are some reports that cannot be explained. While the most of the unexplained reports may not prove the existence of visitants from other planets, this particular case seems to point in that direction.

An Air Force captain--radar specialist--stated on the program "Unidentified Flying Objects" on the American Broadcasting Company network that "Unidentified flying objects have been sighted and tracked on the radar screens of the United States and her allies in many parts of the world, and positively identified as such by competent and experienced personnel. Similarly... of the extra-territorial research organization into to co-operate fully with the U.S. Air Force in its studies."

Therefore, we would like to discuss the above and other reports we have received with you in person. We have discussed this on several occasions with the Air Technical Intelligence Center in the past future, at which time we would like to discuss how we might best aid you in such a way as to serve your best interests. I am confident Mr. Chorwon will be impressed with the work I have done. 

If you are in doubt as to the reliability of this matter, please bear in mind that I am a student at the University of Pennsylvania this fall on a 4 year full-tuition Alumni Scholarship.

May I extend my best wishes for success in your research.
Very truly yours,
