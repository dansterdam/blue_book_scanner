Aircraft Control and Warning
Squadron, APO 970 make the following statement concerning the sighting of a
unidentified aerial object during the morning hours of 31 May 1952.

On the morning of 31 May 1952 at about 0400 hours the guard on post #6 called
me by field telephone and called my attention to a bright object in the sky
North east of my position. At this time I was on guard duty at Post #4. It seemed
like a falling star at first. My post was about 100 foot above the camp which is
at approximately 2000 feet above sealevel in elevation. The object stopped falling
at about 2000 feet and went straight back up to about 3000 to 4000 feet. It started
its fall first from approximately 3600 feet. The object started to head toward
the East for about one half mile, then it stopped and reversed it's course and
headed back to the Northeast in a smooth flight at a speed of about 100 to 150 miles
per hour. Then it reversed it's heading once again in a Eastward direction and
started to climb at a 45 degree angle away from my position. As it headed away it
picked up speed in a jerking motion and then faded from sight. The facts stated
in this statement are all true to the best of my knowledge.

STATEMENT                                                       1 June 1952

607th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, APO 970 make the following statement concerning the sighting of a unidentified aerial object during the morning hours of 31 May 1952.

On the morning of 31 May 1952 I was standing guard duty when I heard a jet in the North. It had a pulsating sound, like it was idling. I couldn't see anything at first but in a few seconds a small light appeared at about 3500 feet. I thought a helicopter was hovering there with a light on one side and had turned that side to me. The light began dropping at a very slow rate and getting larger as it dropped. As it got larger it took on a glow. It stopped falling at about 2600 feet altitude and it took the form of a disk. The center was duller in color in respect with the rim which was much brighter.

The object started moving to the East. It seemed to me to be moving with short jerky movements. It moved a ways and changed direction. The change seemed to be instantaneous. It started moving West. It traveled West but not as far as the point from where it had first started roving to the East. Again it changed direction and again the change appeared to be instantaneous. It started heading East again. It was climbing at an angle of approximately 25 degrees. It traveled East for a while and started climbing into the North at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. It kept climbing until I could no longer see it, or rather it just faded out.

                                                        August 1, 1952

Operation Bluebook
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Tri-hi-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
Attention: Captain E. J. Ruppelt

Gentlemen:

For some time I have personally been deeply interested in the mysterious so-called "flying saucers" or unidentified aerial objects commonly known as "flying saucers." Beginning last November a group of us interested in this problem organized a unified civilian research unit in the name of the Extra-Terrestrial Research Organization.

Since last November we have increased our membership from 8 to 10 such under 100 members. These members are of varying backgrounds and occupations. They are scattered throughout over 20 states of the United States, 2 provinces of Canada, Cuba, England, France, Hawaii, and Alaska.

As a result of the limited research we have been able to undertake, we have in our files at least 5 reports of unidentified objects that are, or the "flying saucer" category and that we know are definitely not in Operation Bluebook files. In addition, we have received reports from our European members covering 76 European sightings of unidentified objects similar to those you are presently investigating. These sightings date from September 26, 1869 to July 16, 1952.

To give an example of the type of reports we regard as reliable and worthy of basic analysis, I would like to give the following, which may or may not be in Air Force files.

At 2:25 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 18, 1952, in Lakewood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Mrs. [redacted] was talking to Mrs. [redacted] my mother. The sky was a beautiful blue without a cloud in sight.

[redacted] was standing on her back porch (first floor) looking up at my mother who was in our upstairs bedroom. The angle of elevation was approximately 45 degrees from the [redacted] porch to the top of our roof.


- page 8 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Suddenly Mrs. [redacted] who lacks four credit hours of
receiving her Master's degree in mathematics from
Davison University, pointed to the sky just above our
roof. She described an arc with her finger before
she was able to blurt out the word, "Saucer!" As she
told me later, it was the most natural thing for her
to say—that was the word best fitted to describe the
situation in a nutshell—in spite of the fact th t she
had been quite skeptical of previous reports. My
mother, knowing that I had been quite interested in
such phenomena, immediately called down to the basement
where I had been working on some equipment for my
amateur radio station. About three seconds later I
was outside, but by that time the object had disappeared.
Immediately began getting data from Mrs. Lenne. The
following represents the data gathered and calculations
based upon it:

Mrs. [redacted] saw a round object, resembling an ellipse,
appeared from behind our roof. It was the size of a
dime held 22 inches from her eyes. The object was "lily
brightly polished silvery" and traveled at an enormous
speed, traversing approximately on quarter of the horizon in 1.5 to 2 seconds, where it was lost behind the
trees. There was no sound or exhaust trail of any sort.
The object was devoid of any wings. About 15 minutes
later a group of fighter planes in formation appeared
from the west southwest. The object had traveled from
approximately east northeast to west southwest. The
formation of planes passed over and reappeared some
minutes later—in two groups, I believe. They flew
fairly low—low enough to make them easily distinguishable and low enough to hear the quite audible roar of their
motors. I noticed quite a few private planes appear
at about the same time. This could easily be simply
a result of the excellent flying weather prevailing.

From the data gathered it is possible to calculate the
approximate speed, distance, and altitude of the
object, as follows:

[Mathematical calculations shown at bottom of page]

SIZE OF OBJECT = DISTANCE TO OBJECT / DISTANCE TO DIME
SIZE OF OBJECT = (100' DIAM / 30' DIAM)
SIZE OF DIME = 45" / 64"
DISTANCE TO DIME = 22"

Calculations result in x = 5312' or 797'


- page 9 -

CALCULATORS (CONTD.) --

ALTITUDE = a
CA = b = a
DISTANCE TO OBJECT = c = 5312'/797'
a² + b² = c²   2a² = c²   2a² = 5312'/797'

a = 3756' / 563.5'

y = SPEED = (5312' PER 2 SECONDS)
y = (2.6 56' PER SECOND
y = (398.5'
y = (18/10 MPH
y = 271 MPH

The calculated speed is 1810 mph, assuming the object to be 100 feet in diameter--a commonly reported (estimated) size. If such were the diameter, the altitude would be 3756 feet. The distance from Mrs. Lenne to the object would have been 5312 feet. If, on the other hand, the object was only 30 feet in diameter, another commonly reported size, the speed would be 271 mph, the distance from Mrs. 797 feet, and the altitude 563.5 feet.

I do not believe that the former calculations support the distance as was shown, in spite of the former's high speed. If such an object had been flying at 271 mph at an altitude of only 563.5 feet, surely many people would have seen it and it would have been reported in the press. It was not. In addition, there would most likely have been a noise of some sort. There was none.

In my mind this report, based on eyewitness testimony seconds after sighting the object, and the data personally gathered by myself, proves that there are some reports that cannot be explained by normal means. The Air Force has stated, via the press, that most of the 20% of unexplained reports were not explained due to insufficient data. I have tried to prevent this from happening in this case. I made every effort at the time to obtain every bit of information possible. I hope that this report will be of some help to you. Mrs. [REDACTED] has given me her permission to describe what she saw--provided there was no publicity or reporters. I trust that this report will be in confidence. This same report has been forwarded to Civilian Saucer Investigations, Box 1971, Main Post Office, Los Angeles 55, California.

An Air Force captain--radar specialist--stated on the program "Crossfire" over the American Broadcasting Co., "The Air Force stands ready at any time to send specialists anywhere in the United States to investigate reports of any unidentified objects." Similarly, we of the Extra-Terrestrial Research Organization intend to co-operate fully with the Air Force in its research.

Therefore, we would like to discuss the above and other reports we have gathered, with you in person.
If it is possible to do so, we would like to visit the Air Technical Intelligence Center in the near future. At such time we would like to discuss how we might best aid you in such a way as we can in your program. Jim Schwaber, Co-ordinator of F.T.R.O., and myself would represent our group. We will be free the weekends of August 9-10 and 16-17.

If you are in doubt as to the reliability of this letter, please bear in mind that I plan to attend the University of Pennsylvania this fall on a 4 year full-tuition Alumni Scholarship.

May I extend my best wishes for success in your research?

Very truly yours,

RECORD OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. Time sighted: 0345 zonal time.
   Length of time sighted: approximately 9 minutes.
   Date of sighting: 31 May 1952.

2. Brief description of the sighted object or objects:
   Shape:     Round.
   Size:      Undetermined due to fact that there was no way to compare it with
              known object.
   Color:     Brilliant white.
   Number of objects:    One.
   Trail of exhaust:     Negative.
   Propulsion system:    Unknown.
   Estimated speed:      450 knots when pulling away from the F-94 at 30,000 foot
   altitude.
   Aerodynamic features: Impossible to observe at close range due to blinding
                         light of object.
   Any unusual maneuvers: None but externally capable of maneuvering.

   Manner of approach:   The F-94, the radar in a port turn to intercept unidentified object 4000 feet below on a 90° course at altitude of 8000 feet.
   Additional object description: The object was first sighted by the F-94 interceptor at the base light of dawn. The return on after burner was to intercept the object on a course which paralleled the F-94's course. The pilot was able to get western of the other, likewise was unable to 3 1/2 feet where more precise radar tracking for a few minutes was made. The pilot then increased his speed to an estimated 400 knots on a 15° heading and began pulling away from the F-94. When in level turn, the pilot, heading in a westerly direction, increased his speed to approximately 45° more than one relative to the F-94. Pursuit at 0355 and continued to base.

3. Runner or observation: Visual.
   From air corner first: Pilot and radar operator in the air and personnel on
   ground radar station.
   Course:     90°.
   Altitude:   2000 to 30,000 feet.
   Type of reporting aircraft: F-94.
   Any type of optical or electronic equipment used: neither F-94 or ground radar
   station could maintain an unidentified object.
   If ready, the type and where it was including a mile to where the
   incident the AF-6353 is closer it was 1 mile scintillation at the mile to point
   by any method even at close range.
   Location of observer during the sighting: GI 3310 from 10,000 feet to 30,000 feet.
   Altitude:   38° 02'.
   Longitude:  127° 07'.
   Location of object relative to observer: 5 miles to 500 yds.
   Direction: Picked up at 90° and disappeared to 45°.
   Altitude:   8000 feet to 30,000 feet.
   Identify in: Information on observer and witnesses, estimate of reliability and
   experience and any factors bearing on the validity of the sighting.
   i.e. pilot and radar operator have all missions or scruples, both are quiet,

It then stopped for about 3 to 4 seconds and during this time the object appeared like a disc. It had a pulsating sound resembling a lot idling. After two objects had stopped momentarily it proceeded to move toward the east for about 1 mile with jerky movements, and then stopped again momentarily, reversed its direction abruptly and made, what is almost a straight line, same position it was the first time... at this point the object stopped again at a small climb to a point to the right of the mountain where the radar station is located, at this point the object went into a steep climb (about 42 degree angle), to the north and disappeared in a matter of 3 to 4 seconds.

3. Manner of observation: Visual.
   Any type of electronic equipment used: Negative.
   The observer, who is also a radar mechanic, stated that the radar at the site in usable condition was within 1 mile to the site.

6. Extracted from Fifth Air Force "Parintrep", 19 May 1952:

Balloon sightings: At 16/210-1, vicinity of CT 1035, an F-94, crew observed a balloon approximately 3 feet in/diameter. Observation was made by name of a small light suspended from the balloon. The balloon was first observed at 13000 feet and the F-94 followed to 21,000 feet. Estimated rate of climb of balloon was 2000 ft/min, at 16/210, had to go 4 kilometers in the chase. The balloon was shot down over CT 1016, at 16/3551-1, vicinity CT 2823, an F-94 crew again observed a balloon, this time at 12000 feet. Again trying to make a steady burning light and suspended a friendly pursuit, the balloon using afterburner, shooting at some 6 feet diameter balloon. Friendly pursued the balloon using afterburner, shooting at 4 to 6 feet diameter balloon. The white light generated as very powerful, was still burning as the balloon fell. D/I Comment (5th AF) - Further investigation is being made by the 5th Air Group.

a. Comment - This report of lighted balloons may be a basis of explanation for many of the sightings reported over this area of Korea.
