PART II
I    Analysis
    a.    Additional Factors

    (1)    In addition to Mr. [illegible] sightings, the State Police from
    Malone, N.Y. reported that between 1930 and 1945 hrs (EST) some of the
    residents of Malone heard an explosion which rattled windows etc.

    (2)    Mr. [illegible] also mentioned when interviewed that other people
    in the general area between Saranac Lake and Malone, N.Y. had heard a
    object.

    (3)    In addition according to Mr. [illegible] people in the area of
    Chateaugay, N.Y. reported sort of an "earthquake" type of sighting.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM    Intelligence Division
         380th Bomb Wing (M)(SAC)                REPORT NO.    380 DOT-1-58           PAGE   5   OF   5   PAGES

(4) Sgt Handy of the State Police, Keesville Barracks, and a
numerous people in the area of the Harrietstown, N.Y. Airport talked with
Manager of the Harrietstown, N.Y. Airport talking with
object was a meteor.

(5) On March 28 a CAP pilot Albert Parris flew over the suggested
route of the object and recorded no indications of any strange crash or
the like. Visibility was slightly hazy, but ground was clearly visible.

(6) Mr [redacted] has had some experience around aircraft and in
addition he has done some civilian flying. In this Officer's opinion Mr
[redacted] may be considered as a fairly reliable observer.

b. Comments as to cause or identity of object.

(1) A list of known flights in the general area of the sighting
is included. Two of those listed, the Trans Canada Flights from Montreal
to Toronto, and Toronto to Montreal, might have been mistaken for said
object but this is unlikely unless they were below their relatively high
altitudes of 16,000 and 7,000 ft respectively. Also, Massena is quite a
ways North of the area of the sighting.

c. Statement supporting analysis and commentary.

(1) In the opinion of this Officer the object sighted by Mr.
[redacted] have been a meteor or meteorite. Mr [redacted] claims the
object he observed was quite low. He has observed meteors or so called
"shooting stars" before, but claims this object was much lower, nevertheless, in my opinion, it is conceivable even though weather, visibility,
and sighting conditions were very good that Mr [redacted] could have misjudged the altitude of the object especially since it was at night.

Since this sighting, no additional evidence of any kind has been uncovered.
