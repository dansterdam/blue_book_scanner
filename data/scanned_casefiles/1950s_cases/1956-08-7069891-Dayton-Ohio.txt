The text in the document reads as follows:

Flying Object Reports
Received on 11-29
of 22 AVG 1956

Several reports of flying objects were called in last night. I took notes on 4 of them. The object that I have a light-like object was seen crossing back and forth across the city of Dayton last night. It seemed to be somewhat dim in flame and made no noise. Only one report was received at the Sheriff's Office after 2100 hours. The Deputy Sheriff made his two calls at 0100 and after this reporting. Here are some of the names and addresses of the people who witnessed this flight (?)

"Flying Saucer?"
NO! Just Plane!
People in this area have been alarmed last night by a "flying saucer" circling low over the Miami Valley - just the wrong sight - but it was the Wright Air Development Center's photographer reconneissance plane taking night photos of the Dayton area. The Wright Air Development Center photographers at what they thought were strange lights had excited people to believe that it was a "flying saucer." Sorry.

The image does not contain any photographs, only sketches and illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line to illustrate how high an object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second larger sketch shows a person standing on a road with buildings in the background, and a smaller sketch in the corner showing a person standing on a hilltop or mountain.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
