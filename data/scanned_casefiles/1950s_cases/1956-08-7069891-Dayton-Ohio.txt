Flying Object Reports
received on list
of 22 Aug 1956

Several reports of flying objects were called in last night. I took notes on a few. The gist of these reports was that a light-like object was seen crossing back and forth across the city of Dayton last night. It seemed to eject a blur in flame and made no noise. Only one report described it to be disc shaped. Most of these reports came in shortly after 2100 hours. The Deputy Sheriff made his two calls at 0400 and after this morning. Here are some of the names and addresses of the people who witnessed this flight (?).

[Names and addresses are redacted]

Dayton

I have attached my notes to this report.

[Newspaper clipping]
"Flying Saucer"?
No, Just Plane!
Any area resident who may have been alarmed last night by a "flying saucer" cruising leisurely over the Miami Valley may draw the wrong conclusion.

The Wright Air Development Center's photographic reconnaissance airplane was taking pictures of the Dayton area again. This is the same ship which aired a number of Xenia people to believe Wright-Patterson Air Force base was with intelligence one night several weeks ago. Equipped with a strong searchlight, the plane does present an eerie sight. But it wasn't a flying saucer. Sorry.
