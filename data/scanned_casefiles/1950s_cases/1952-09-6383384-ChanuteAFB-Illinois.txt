AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Group)
Wing Intelligence Section
Chanute AFB, Illinois

REPORT NO.
PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

On 17 September 1952, 1st Lt Alan R. HOGAN, AO 2,9150, 1916-2 AACS, Chanute AFB, Illinois, aircraft controller, rated pilot's not on flying status, with 590 flying hours and 65 combat missions in Martin B-26s was interviewed in his office and stated in substance:

It OCCURRED along with two airmen was on duty in the CHANUTE AFB control tower on the evening of 16 September 1952. All three men noticed an unusually bright bluish-white light, approximately ten (10) times the diameter of the neighboring stars, in the sky at approximately 15 degrees above the horizon and approximately 50 degrees compass heading.

During the period of observation, 2210 hrs CDT to 2325 hrs CDT, the object moved in a straight path from the forementioned position to approximately 20 degrees above the horizon and 85 degrees compass heading.

It then ascended to approximately 60 degrees above the horizon and to a 90 degree compass heading and disappeared as if going behind a cloud. During the same time which elapsed approximately three (3) times as a period of several minutes each time. On its reappearance the object was always at a higher altitude and appeared to be larger. From 2225 hrs CDT the object was under constant observation.

The binoculars made the object appear approximately twice as large as it appeared to the naked eye. Farther the binoculars the object was seen to be a small satellite. One satellite was to the object's left and slightly above center, the other was to the right and slightly below center. During the period of observation the satellites did not change their relative position to the main body. There was no apparent sound, oscillation or fluttering motion.

The weather consisted of thunder storms in the west behind the observers and light clouds around the area. It was definitely not clouds that the object was seen between.

A local B-25 was requested to attempt interception of the object. The aircraft was confirmed to be at an altitude of not more than 10,000 feet. The pilot of the B-25 over saw the object and was unable to close to a position of a star or the clouds.

The other control tower operators agreed substantially upon the appearance and course of the object with Lt HOGAN.
