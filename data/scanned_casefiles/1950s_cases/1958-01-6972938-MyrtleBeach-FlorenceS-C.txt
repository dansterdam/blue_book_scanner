HQ stated that the end a friend (unidentified) had observed the object for approx. the same length of time as witnesses stated.
10. - At approximately 2400 hours (EST), the investigator who had taken statement apparently called the JANITOR at the GREGG JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL to ascertain the exact time the object was observed. The JANITOR stated that he definitely observed the object from 2320 to 2340 hours (EST). This appears to substantiate the witness' sighting. 
11. - According to the OPERATOR of the radar station, the objects picked up by the radar were moving at an estimated 1800-3000 MPH.
12. -   It was estimated that the object passed over a certain highway intersection in Sough Carolina at approximately 2345 hours (EST). A PATROLMAN of the FLORENCE, S.C. POLICE DEPARTMENT reported observing a bright light in the sky near South Carolina around 2345 hours (EST), which appeared to be descending. His observation coincided with the estimated time the object passed over the highway intersection.

The image shows a page from an old newspaper called "Final Herald" with the headline "Venus - So Bright - Causing Quite A Stir". The page contains two photographs, one showing a bright light or object in the night sky, and the other showing what appears to be a small object or reflection.

Venus - So Bright - Causing Quite A Stir

VENUS, THE BRILLIANT STAR, has upset some observers and,
astronomers alike with its unusual brightness, clear visibility and
strange behavior. The Venus disk reflects an unusual amount of light,
making it about 5 times as bright as usual. This has caused much discussion
and some alarm among skywatchers. Many believe the earth is passing
through a cloud or mist that reflects light from Venus in an unusual
manner.

The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains a detailed illustration of the night sky, showing the positions and names of various celestial bodies and constellations. There is no photographic image present on this page.

OUTPUT:

Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the southwestern sky, and is joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

This is the time of year when the Leonids are most active, and they continue to be seen after midnight in the northern sky. Some of the Leonids this year will produce exceptionally bright meteors, which in the past have been mistaken for flaming objects in the sky.

Venus is by far the most brilliant object in the sky at present, and in the neighboring areas of Capricorn, there is much celestial activity of a much lower order of brightness. This portrays the Ethiopian picture who was an expert in the skies and the celestial activity, and he was looking forward to a spectacular display of the Leonids during this season, and he was rewarded by the unique display which materialized.

In the north, a group forming the letter M in the heavens is the constellation Cassiopeia. To the right is Polaris, the North Star, and to the left is the brilliant star Capella, a star of the first magnitude. Lower in the sky is Aldebaran, a star of reddish hue in the constellation Taurus.

To the left is another bright star, Aquila, the Eagle, which is one of the brightest stars in the heavens. Just above Aquila is the smaller constellation Sagitta, the Arrow. Still higher and to the right are the two bright stars Vega and Altair, which with Deneb form the famous Summer Triangle, one of the most striking groups in the heavens.

Pegasus, the winged horse, is high in the western sky, and under his hoofs is the faint constellation Andromeda. To the right of Pegasus is the constellation Cepheus, while just above him is the constellation Cassiopeia again.

Most viewers scan the sky far and wide, but fail to find any unusual activity - no unidentified flying objects or flying saucers or strange phenomena. They have been disappointed again. And yet on this very night the Ethiopian was lucky and saw a spectacular display of the Leonid meteors.

SYMBOLS FOR STARS: 1S-UNDER or ST BRIGHTMESS
