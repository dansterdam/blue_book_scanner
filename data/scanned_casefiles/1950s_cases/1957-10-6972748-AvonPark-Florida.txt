Summary: (Gives narrative which highlights the salient features of narrative report. This narrative has been received enclosed PD Form 96, dated 22 Oct 57 from Avon Park Bombing Range)

1. The following is a partial quote from the night controllers of 18 October 1957. Quote "Notes" "At 1950 I spotted a reddish "In Center" white light which went out of our range about 1500 ft., high. For a few seconds it did not more than it went out of sight fast". "A/1C Barnett saw it also" unquote.

Description:
Comparative size and shape: Similar to Jet stream of an A/C on take-off
Tail Train: Similar to Jet con trail
First called observers attention to light: Reddish glow in white center
Length of time in sight: Few seconds
Observer was standing in front of Communications, Avon Park, EOR
Observers name is A/1C Henry C. Zuniga, AF 18455677
No further notes from area by other personnel.
Note: A/1C Zuniga and A/1C William E. Barnett, AF 14524192 are competent reliable aircraft controllers on the Avon Park Bombing and Gunnery Range.

The only discrepancy that I could find on their observation of the light was that A/1C Barnett seemed to think it just went out rather than trail off.
