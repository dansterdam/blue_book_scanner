APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT    UNCLASSIFIED

At approximately 0355 CST 12 January 1953 in San Antonio, Texas, and vicinity, two unidentified objects were sighted in San Antonio, Texas, with two luminous objects. They appeared to be about 3,500 ft. as a medium-sized airplane, but had no trail, exhaust, or other visible means of propulsion, nor did they emit any sound. They continued moving at about 200 mph in a straight line away from the observers, and their disappearance was gradual. One of the objects was several thousand feet above and to the left of the other.

A visual surface observation was made by the two men who first sighted the object while driving in an automobile. They stopped the car and watched it until it disappeared. They first saw the object when their automobile turned Southeast on Phelps Drive at Kelly AFB. The observed were 20-25 years of age, from the Southeastern direction at a distance of three or four miles. The altitude of the objects was 3-5 and 5-3 thousand feet. Course, altitude and speed were all constant.

At the time the sky was clear, and a light breeze was blowing. Temperature was described as warm to cool, and dry. No unusual meteorological phenomena existed which might have explained the objects to the layman.

There was no physical evidence of the sighting, nor was any interception or identification action taken.

The Kelly tower was checked. No jet aircraft were in the vicinity at the time. Furthermore, the pilot of a twin-engined plane which had passed between the observers and objects said that he had seen nothing.

[Redacted] is chief investigator for the Air Police Office, Kelly AFB, and [redacted] is also an investigator for the office. Their reliability is presumed to be excellent, and since accurate observation is a part of their everyday job, their reports should reflect the use of well-trained facilities. The high degree of similarity between the two reports substantiates this.

STATEMENT OF

At approximately 0955 hours, 12 January 1953, r--- southeast on Tinker Air Force Base, Police Investigator, and myself, were driving southeast on Tinker Drive, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. I was observing a twin engine aircraft which had just bolted off when something bright in the southeast direction attracted my eye. Upon looking again, I noted two (2) bright objects, at which time I asked Mr. --- if he also saw the objects. He did, and we stopped the car and watched the objects until they disappeared from sight.

These objects appeared to rotate, emit light and a haze of the opinion that they could possibly be aircraft, but I have observed aircraft on various other occasions, and have never seen one completely disappear from view and still not be able to identify it as such. Both objects were going directly away from the position we were standing, and at no time changed course or altitude. One object appeared to be 3,700 to 4,000 feet from the ground, and the second object appeared to be 3,700 to 4,000 feet higher than the first, and at about a forty-five degree (450) angle from the first object.

STATEMENT

At approximately 0755 hours 12 January 1953 I was riding as a passenger in the private automobile of my superior, Mr. [redacted] Chief Investigator, Air Police Office, Kelly Air Force Base. As we turned Southeast on Tinker Drive, on Kelly Air Force Base, one of us observed two objects flying Southeast of the base. One remarked, jokingly, "Look, flying saucers," and then added, "they are flying saucers." We stopped near Gate #302 and watched the objects, trying to decide what they were.

One was apparently 7000 to 9000 feet above the earth, the other about 2000 feet below the first and probably 2000 feet to our left. They seemed to be about as large as a medium-sized plane. No vapor trail was visible, and no sound could be heard. The objects disappeared from sight in about four minutes.

At first we thought we were observing two jet aircraft in flight with the sun reflecting off their flight surfaces, but soon were convinced that such was not the case.

While we were watching, a twin-engined airplane circled the airdrome and passed between us and the objects.

Mr. [redacted] checked with the Kelly Tower and was told that no jet aircraft was in the area, and the pilot of the twin engined plane we had seen stated he had seen nothing.

AF FORM 112-PART II
UNCLASSIFIED

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SAMA

In compliance with AF Letter 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) Object was round, size estimated by observers varied but was reported as being comparable to sphere ranging in diameter from six to eighteen inches observed from a distance of ten feet. Object was luminous with a whitish-gray thing and gave the appearance of being of aluminum construction. Only one object was observed. No aerodynamic features, trail or exhaust, no propulsion system noted. Speed estimated, but was considerable, faster than conventional aircraft. No sound was heard. Some conflict exists as to the maneuvers performed by the object; one observer stated that the object gave appearance of gaining altitude, another stated that it veered off its westward course slightly to the North, while the driver of the automobile in which the observers were riding stated that the object flew a straight and level path. Object disappeared by moving out of the range of vision.

(2) Object was sighted at approximately 1715 hours, CST, 9 January 1953 and was observed for less than sixty seconds.

(3) A visual surface observation without electronic or optical equipment was made.

(4) Observers were riding in an automobile and had stopped for traffic at the intersection of Monterrey and Zarzamora Street, San Antonio, Texas, when object was sighted. Object appeared in the West sky heading East. The angle between object and observers estimated to be between sixty and seventy degrees. Distance and altitude unknown, however, observers were of the opinion that the object was at a greater altitude than any conventional type aircraft seen.

(5) Objects were observed by [REDACTED]

(6) Fair weather prevailed at the time of the sighting.

(7) No activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, is known to have existed which might account for the sighting.

(8) No physical evidence of the sighting.

(9) No interception or identification action taken.

(10) Location of any air traffic in the general area at the time of the sighting unknown.

STATEMENT

At approximately 1715 hours, 9 January 1953, I was driving home from Kelly AF Base where I am employed. I was accompanied by Miss [blacked out] and Miss [blacked out] We were driving North on Zarazora Street and had just passed the intersection of Monterey and Zarazora Streets when Miss [blacked out] called our attention to something in the sky. As previously stated, I was driving so I could not give my complete attention to the object. However, I did notice that it had a rather oblong shape and had a dull whitish-gray color. Its size appeared approximately equal to that of a small bicycle wheel from about three feet distance. The object was first sighted to the West of us and was heading East at a very rapid rate of speed, faster than any ordinary aircraft I have seen. The object flew in a straight line and I could not say how it disappeared because of the difficulty of observation from my position in the car.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:

[Signature is blacked out]

STATEMENT

On 9 January 1953 at approximately 1/15 hours, I was riding home in a car operated by Mrs. [redacted] Miss [redacted] was also a passenger in the car. We drove North on Zarzamora Street and had just stopped for a traffic light at the intersection of Monterrey and Zarzamora Streets when I noticed an unusual object in the sky off to our left. I called this to the attention of Mrs. [redacted] and Miss [redacted], and as we observed it, the object streaked across our path and continued on a course due East. The object appeared to be flying a little higher than ordinary airplanes and was somewhat faster. After the object crossed in front of us, it gradually veered off in a Northerly direction and disappeared much as if it went behind a cloud only there were no clouds in the sky. The object was round and was of a silverish shiny color. I would estimate the size to be comparable to that of a fifteen inch diameter ball observed from ten feet.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:

STATEMENT

At approximately 1710 hours, Central Standard Time, 9 January 1953,
I was riding home from work with two [redacted] and Miss [redacted]

We were heading North on Zarzamora Street and had just
passed the intersection of Monterey and Zarzamora Streets when Miss
[redacted] called my attention to a strange object in the sky. I was
riding in the back seat and had to stoop down to see the object so I
would estimate the angle between the object and myself to be somewhere
between sixty and seventy degrees. The object looked round to me and
gave the appearance of being of aluminum construction. I would estimate
the size of the object to be comparable to a six inch diameter ball held
at arms length. I did not notice any sound nor did I observe any trail
or exhaust. I cannot even begin to estimate the altitude of the object
but it was much higher than any plane I have ever seen. This object was
in the West sky bearing East at a tremendous rate of speed. It was
much faster than any jet plane I have ever seen and must have been
many times as large as any plane because of the comparative sizes. The
object did not dip, dive, or perform any type of maneuvers. However,
it gave me the impression of steadily gaining altitude until it passed
in front of us and continued towards the East getting smaller and
smaller until it was no longer visible.
