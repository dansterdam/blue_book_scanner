SUMMARY: (What the report seems to describe, in the absence of an identifying witness paragraph...)

Text extracted from the document:

AT APPROXIMATELY 0935 CST 12 JANUARY 1953, AT SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, TWO LUMINOUS ELLIPTICAL OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED. THEY APPEARED TO BE ABOUT AS LARGE AS A DIME HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH, AND WERE MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER, AND THEIR DISAPPEARANCE WAS GRADUAL. ONE OF THE OBJECTS SEEMED TO BECOME SMALLER DURING ITS FLIGHT.

A VISUAL SURFACE OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY THE TWO MEN WHO FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECTS. IT IS REPORTED THAT THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING ABOUT TWICE AS FAST AS A FAST JET AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECTS WERE GOING IN A STRAIGHT AWAY FROM THEM IN A NORTHEASTERN DIRECTION AT A CONSTANT ALTITUDE. THE OBJECTS THEN FADED AWAY.

IT IS THE OPINION OF THE OBSERVERS THAT THE SKY WAS CLEAR, AND A VISUAL HORIZON WAS ESTABLISHED, WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPLAINED THE OBJECTS TO THE LAYMEN.

THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THE SIGHTING, NOR WAS ANY INTERCEPTION OR IDENTIFICATION ATTEMPTED.

CAPTAIN ___ IS THE CHIEF INVESTIGATOR FOR THE AIR POLICE OFFICER, AND CAPTAIN ___ IS THE INSPECTOR FOR THAT OFFICER. THEIR INVESTIGATION WAS GUIDED BY THEIR REALIZATION THAT ACCURATE OBSERVATION IS A PART OF THEIR EVERYDAY JOB, SINCE THEY MUST EVALUATE SIMILAR REPORTS IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR DUTIES. THE INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED CONFORMS WITH ESTABLISHED POLICIES.

STATEMENT OF

At approximately 0335 hours, 13 January 1953, witness observed an aircraft at an altitude of about 2,000 feet descending at an angle of 30 to 45 degrees. The aircraft was moving in a west-northwesterly direction and was observed for about two (2) minutes. The aircraft did not have any lights and appeared to be circular in shape. It seemed to reflect a bright silvery glow, as if illuminated. The witness observed the object as it descended and noted that it made no sound. The witness further stated that just before it disappeared from view, the object seemed to rise quickly and disappear. The witness also stated that he had a rather unnerving feeling while observing the object. No more details regarding the sighting were furnished.

SIGHTING

At approximately 9:55 hours 12 January 1953 I was riding as a passenger in the private automobile of my superior, Mr. *****, Chief Investigator, Air Police Office, Kelly Air Force Base. As we turned southeast on Truker Drive, on Kelly Air Force Base, one of us observed two objects flying southeast of the base. One remarked, jokingly, "Look, flying saucers," and then added, "they are flying saucers." We stopped near Gate 3202 and watched the objects. One was apparently 7,000 to 9,000 feet above the earth, the other about 2,000 feet below the first and probably 2,000 feet to our left. They seemed to be about as large as a medium-sized plane. No vapor trail was visible, and no sound could be heard. The objects disappeared from sight in about four minutes.

At first we thought we were observing two jet aircraft in flight with the sun reflecting off their flight surfaces, but soon were convinced that such was not the case.

While we were watching, a twin-engine airplane circled the airdromes and passed between us and the objects.

Mr. ****** checked with the Kelly Tower and was told that no jet aircraft was in the area, and that the pilot of the twin-engine plane we had seen stated he had seen nothing.

STATEMENT

At approximately 17:15 hours, 9 January 1953, I was driving home from Kelly AFB airbase where I am employed. I was driving North on Castroville Street and had just passed the intersection of Monterey and Castroville Streets when Miss [REDACTED] called our attention to something in the sky. As previously stated, I was driving so I could not give my complete attention to the object. However, I did notice that it had a rather oblong shape and had a dull whitish-gray color. Its size appeared approximately equal to that of a small bicycle wheel from about three feet distance. The object was first sighted to the West of us and was heading East at a very rapid rate of speed, faster than any ordinary aircraft I have seen. The object flew in a straight line and I could not say how it disappeared because of the difficulty of observation from my position in the car.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:

STATEMENT

On 9 January 1953 at approximately 1:15 hours, I was riding home in a car operated by Mrs. [REDACTED], Miss [REDACTED] was also a passenger in the car. We drove North on Zarzamora Street and had just stopped for a traffic light at the intersection of Monterrey and Zarzamora Streets when I noticed an unusual object in the sky off to our left. I called this to the attention of Mrs. [REDACTED] and Miss [REDACTED], and as we observed it, the object streaked across our path and continued on a course due East. The object appeared to be flying a little higher than ordinary airplanes and was somewhat faster. After the object crossed in front of us, it gradually veered off in a Northerly direction and disappeared, much as it went behind a cloud. Only there were no clouds in the sky. The object was round and was of a silverish shiny color. I would estimate the size to be comparable to that of a fifteen inch diameter ball observed from ten feet.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

STATEMENT
At approximately 1710 hours, Central Standard Time, 9 January 1952, I was riding home from work with two other persons. We were heading North on Zaragoza Street and had just passed the intersection of Monterrey and Zaragoza Streets when a strange object in the sky caught my attention. I was riding in the back seat and had to stoop down to see the object so I would estimate the angle between the object and myself to be somewhere between sixty and seventy degrees. The object looked round to me and gave the appearance of being of aluminum construction. I would estimate the size of the object to be comparable to a six inch diameter ball held at arm's length. I did not notice any sound nor did I observe any trail or exhaust. I cannot even begin to estimate the altitude of the object but it was much higher than any plane I have ever seen. The object was in the fast sky diving but at a tremendous rate of speed. It was much faster than any jet plane I have ever seen and must have been many times as large as any planes because of the comparative sizes. The object did not dip, dive, or perform any type of maneuvers. However, it gave me the impression of steadily gaining altitude until it passed in front of us and continued towards the East, getting smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible.

The shared image does not contain any photograph. The image is a page from a Project Blue Book report document, titled "UNCLASSIFIED" and dated January 9, 1953. The text in the document describes an incident that occurred in San Antonio, Texas, where a civilian female source observed a small, round luminous aluminum object traveling at a high speed and disappearing after making a gradual climbing turn. The report concludes that the object was "Probably jet aircraft."

The full text transcribed from the document is as follows:
