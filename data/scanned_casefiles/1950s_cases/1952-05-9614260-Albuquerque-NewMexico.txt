SUMMARY (Give below a summary of the report. Use factual and concise paragraph. List locations at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part 112)

Three unidentified flying objects were sighted over Northeast Albuquerque by two city fire department employees at three different intervals during a day of clear skys except for a few scattered cumulus clouds over the mountains area north and east of the city.

The first object was sighted at 1345 MST approaching from the northeast toward the observers at a high altitude and an extremely high speed. It had a circular shape, a shining silver color, no visible source of propulsion, and no sound could be heard. The object approached to a point estimated at four miles from the observers and then rose in a sharp clockwise spiral. Slight was lost because of the higher altitude attained.

The second object appeared at a lower altitude (estimated at 15,000 ft.) from above the mountains northeast of the observers at 1400 MST. They moved in a straight line and appeared to move faster than the first object. Both seemed to be of the same design as the first object, but had an orange or light brown color. The objects turned so quickly on a horizontal plane or color, the objects seemed to be thirty (30) to forty (40) feet in diameter at this point, which was the closest approach of an object at any time. The two objects flew in close formation toward the northwest until sight was lost.

A third sighting was made of an object flying high over the mountains northeast of the city at 1140 MST. It had the same characteristics as the first object reported at 1345 MST. The object was flying among scattered cumulus clouds high over the mountains in a curving course from northeast to southeast. Slight haze due to the high altitude caused by the object.

The above mentioned objects were unfamiliar to the observers and seemed to have no characteristics similar to aircraft in this vicinity.
