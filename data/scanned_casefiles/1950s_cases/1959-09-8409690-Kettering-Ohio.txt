At the bottom right of the page. The rest of the text in the image appears to be illegible due to the poor image quality and heavy graininess of the black and white photograph.

The photograph appears to show a landscape with a light-colored object or shape in the sky, with a darker ground or horizon line at the bottom of the image.
