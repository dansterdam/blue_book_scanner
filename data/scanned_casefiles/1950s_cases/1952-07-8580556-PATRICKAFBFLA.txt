REPORT ON FLYING OBJECTS AS OBSERVED AT PATRICK AFB, FLORIDA

On 18 July 1952, flying objects were observed over Patrick AFB, Florida, between the hours of 2115 and 2230. The first object was observed by four airmen who were on duty as aircraft maintenance personnel. They observed an object approach the base from the South at a very slow speed, come to a halt directly over the field, reverse its direction with no apparent turn. At this time an object was seen flying from the East, proceeding to the West at high speed. This was followed by a second object on the same course approximately five seconds later. A fourth object was shortly seen in the West at an angle of approximately 30 degrees altitude from the observers' position, proceeded West, made a wide 180 degree turn over the field and returned to the same original position to where it was first spotted. Time observed in this observance was ten seconds.

The above four objects all were sighted within a period of five to six minutes. The objects were reported as appearing like a great star of amber color. Weather storm detection radars and Tavistock radars were directed on objects but no contacts were made. These two types of radars are not considered to be reliable for such tracking.

Five additional personnel reported the same objects and performance which included the Airdrome officer on duty at the time, control tower operator, aircraft dispatcher and two transient pilots from Wright Patterson AFB.

Two observances were made on 19 July; however, no report was made.

On 21 July, the undersigned received a call from an airman at 2200 hours who reported a similar object over the field. Two minutes later a call was received from the Colonels on the base, one a former commercial test pilot, who reported three objects spread widely in their position which approached from the East. The undersigned immediately went outdoors to observe the objects which had disappeared by that time. Approximately 3 or 4 minutes later an object was observed by me directly overhead flying on a course of 280 degrees at high speed. Altitude was undetermined because of the unknown size of the object. It appeared as a bright star, amber in color. Its speed was steady and was flying on an unnerving course with no deviation observed during the entire flight until it eventually passed out of sight approximately 15 degrees above the horizon in the West. Altitude was estimated at 20,000 feet. Based on this figure, the speed was approximately 700 mph. The above observance were made in clear

The undersigned is a rated pilot, has been based in the reported area for three years and states that he has never seen a phenomena such as this at any time previous

Two observances were made on 19 July, however, no report was made.

On 21 July, the undersigned received a call from an airman at 2200 hours who reported a similar object near the field. Two minutes later a call was received from two Colonels on the base, one a former commercial test pilot, who reported three objects spread widely in their position which approached from the East. The undersigned immediately went outdoors to observe the objects which had disappeared by that time. Approximately 3 or 4 minutes later an object was observed by me directly overhead flying on a course of 280 degrees at high speed. Altitude was undetermined because of the unknown size of the object. It appeared as a bright star, amber in color. Its speed was steady and was flying on an average course in no deviation. The object was observed during the entire flight until it eventually passed out of sight approximately 15 degrees above the horizon in the West. Altitude was estimated at 20,000 feet. Based on this figure, the speed was approximately 700 mph. The above observances were made in clear and unlimited sky conditions. A check was made with all jet air bases in Florida who reported no operations during the reported hours.

The undersigned is a rated pilot, has been based in the reported area for three years and a state that he has never seen a phenomena such as this at any time previous.

REPORT ON FLYING OBJECTS AS OBSERVED AT PATRICK AFB, FLORIDA

On 18 July 1952, flying objects were observed over Patrick AFB, Florida, between the hours of 2145 and 2230. The first object was observed by four airmen who were on duty as aircraft maintenance personnel. They observed an object approach the base from the South at a very slow speed, come to a halt directly over the field, reverse its direction with no apparent turn. At this time an object was seen flying from the East, proceeding to the West at high speed. This was followed by a second object on the same course approximately five seconds later. A fourth object was shortly seen at an angle of approximately 30 degrees altitude from the observers' position, proceeded West, made a wide 180 degrees turn over the field and returned to the same original position to where it was first spotted. Time observed in this observance was ten seconds.

The above four objects all were sighted within a period of five to six minutes. The objects were reported as appearing like a great star of amber color. Weather storm detection radars and Hawkinsound radars were directed on objects but no contacts were made. These two types of radars are not considered to be reliable for such tracking.

Five additional personnel reported the same objects and performance which included the Airdrome Officer on duty at the time, control tower operator, aircraft dispatcher and two transient pilots from Wright Patterson AFB.

MEMORANDUM TO LT COL EVANS:

In compliance with your verbal request following is an account of my observation of the incident at Patrick AFB on Friday evening, 18 July 1952.

At approximately 2150, I, together with Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] both employees of Base Supply, was sitting in a staff car in the parking lot beside the Provost Marshal's office while the driver. [redacted] was getting the trip ticket signed by the OD, 1st [redacted].

"Sharp" light like a large bull's-eye 1 like a 14-inch shining through a frosted glass. It appeared 3 or 4 times the size of a large star. No shape of any kind was discernible. It had a slightly orange or reddish color. It appeared to blink but with no regularity whatever. It was turning off and on but like it was passing behind something. It appeared to be about 2 miles SSW of the Base at 5 to 6 thousand feet approximately over the Banana River. It was proceeding very slowly and was not perfectly stationary in a level path over the river. It seemed to move for 2 or 3 minutes and then stop for 50 seconds to a minute before proceeding. I would estimate that at no time was it traveling at more than 40 MPH. It was approximately west of the center of the Base when we left the South Gate and it faded from view as we proceeded south down A1A.
