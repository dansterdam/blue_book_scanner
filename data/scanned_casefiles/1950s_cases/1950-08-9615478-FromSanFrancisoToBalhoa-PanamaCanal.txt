                                    DETAILS

The German motor vessel MINERVA (Master C. Walborg), a passenger vessel under control of American Consul, was underway Northbound on 14 August, 1950 en route from Stockholm to Hamburg.
During the transit the Master wrote a letter to the ship agents, Panama Canal, describing an appearance which occurred during the voyage, journey from San Francisco to Balboa.

1. Master of the motor vessel "MINERVA", during the ships Northbound transit, called into ship agents, Panama Railroad Company, and submitted the following written statement:

Second voyage to the Arctic

Re: Sky Appearance.

On August 7, 1950 at 16:06 [as vessel MINERVA was traveling from San Francisco to Balboa, Latitude 210 50'N - Longitude 106°W, P.M.

At this moment, there were on the bridge the Master, chief mate, and the A. B. seaman

The sailor was the first one to notice that a flaming appearance rose from the horizon in the Sightline. It was at first thought it could be a high rising flame. In the story, there was a matter of seconds. Before he could say something, the appearance was about 450 high and close and the chieftain, who were talking, saw with unbelievable speed over the ship and disappeared into one direction. The chief-

Note yelled at the same time "flying saucer". The engineer on duty, who was aft, saw a flaming body half the size of the setting sun and with a wave heard of speed, fly away over the ship. It did not look like a meteor or any other cluster of stars.

The appearance had been noticed without any doubt to its actual existence by the [redacted] and the [redacted]. Chiefnote [redacted]

All agreed and describe that they saw a glowing frontal dark and backwards flaming body, the time being after sunset, however still daylight. In the roar, it drew yellow colored tail (orange-yellow). From the upper rear side it became that there were a spraying of sparks. All declared that they have never seen such a sight before.

REPORTING OFFICER'S COMMENTS: During the MINERVA's previous Canal transit on her outward voyage, the Master had been interviewed by a representative of DIO-15M and was found to be a sincere and intelligent individual. It is felt that, since the appearance was witnessed and confirmed by three other individuals besides the incident has sufficient grounds for possible credence.

The IFI No. 0406.0400 was used as the one having the greatest similarity to the subject of this report. However, it is felt that additional IFI numbers should be provided for such unusual occurrences and appearances.

Meteors in the Records

The American Meteoritics Society, whose members specialize in the study of meteors and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such phenomena. From a large enough number of good descriptions of a given meteor, astronomers can analyze the data mathematically and determine the meteor's radiant—the point in the heavens from which it seems to come. The meteor is then identified by its radiant and given an AMS number. The data were published in Meteoritics, the journal of the society, and thus made available for future research.

The records of the society for the years 1950 to 1955 list dozens of fireballs, many of them green, that were somehow overlooked by saucer enthusiasts. On August 11, 1950 (during the maximum of the Perseid shower), a blue-green fireball (AMS 236) apparently oval- or cigar-shaped, appeared over Washington, Oregon, and Idaho at 7:30 P.M. and was reported by more than 100 witnesses. So brilliant that it showed a noticeable disk, it flew in a horizontal path, silently broke into three pieces, and disappeared [8, p. 272].

September 20, the same year, was a big day for meteors. At 1:35 A.M. a giant fireball (AMS 236) roared over southeastern Illinois from north to south, leaving a luminous train visible in five states and illuminating the sky and countryside from St. Louis to Louisville and from Memphis to Knoxville. The final detonation, over western Kentucky, was heard over an area 1000 miles square and shook buildings from Paducah to Memphis. Fragments showered farm over a twenty-five mile area, struck five buildings, and penetrated one roof. About fifty pounds of meteorites dropped in Murray, Calloway County, Kentucky, and are now in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.

That same night about 10:45 P.M. fireballs were reported by plane crews flying over a six-state area—Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico [9, p. 125]. Similar fireballs that vanished without trace were reported on September 28, 1953 (AMS 2331); October 4, 1953 (AMS 2339); May 15, 1954; and October 27, 1954 (AMS 2337).
