Subject: Unidentified Objects in Sky

Gentlemen:

The picture on page 4 of today's Washington News of "Y" formations of unidentified objects photographed over Lubbock, Tex., last August recalls to me a similar phenomenon that came into my line of vision as I stood in my yard recently looking at the television antenna attached to the chimney of my house.

The experience about which I am writing occurred either two or three Saturdays ago (March 22 or 29) in the middle of the day. I kept these objects in sight about one minute.

When these objects were first sighted I was gazing west and a little north at an angle between 45 and 60 degrees with the ground. The objects appeared to be traveling north.

These objects were in a flat "Y" formation. The two lines of the "Y" did not remain straight but appeared to flutter as though some of the objects, but not adjacent ones, were continually dropping slightly behind. Then catching up with the main group. The objects appeared gray in color and oval in shape.

The size and speed of these objects and the distance from me would be entirely a matter of judgment based by misjudging any one of these factors. I was impressed by the apparent great height of the formation - I thought at least two miles. I could not readily distinguish the individual objects. If my judgment of the distance is anything like accurate, the speed of the formation was faster than a jet 'plane. It still appeared to be at a great altitude when I last faded from my sight in the distance.

I am employed by the Interstate Commerce Commission.

Yours truly,

[Signature area is blacked out]
