The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record card, which is a form used to document UFO sightings as part of the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation of unidentified flying objects.

AERIAL PHENOMENA
SUBJECT: FLYING SAUCER REPORT 
DATE: 3 March 1958
PLACE: Denver, Colorado

The object observed was a bright glowing light in the sky. It was seen from about 11:30 pm to 11:40 pm on the night of 3 March 1958 by many witnesses in the Denver, Colorado area.

The light was described as being very bright and self-luminous. It was seen moving at a rapid but uneven speed and making sudden changes in direction. The object was visible for about 10 minutes before disappearing from sight.

No sound was heard emanating from the object. No details of the object's shape or structure were reported, only that it appeared as a bright glowing light in the sky.

Several telephone calls were received by the Denver Police Department and the Air Force reporting the sighting. 

No photographs or other physical evidence were obtained.

The report was investigated by Project Blue Book of the United States Air Force. No conclusive identification of the object could be made based on the available information. The case was classified as "Unidentified".
