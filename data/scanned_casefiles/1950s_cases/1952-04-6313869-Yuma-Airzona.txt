STATEMENT OF OBSERVER

On the 27th of April 1952 between the hours of 2020 and 2230, my wife and I, while sitting in our automobile at the Yuma Drive-In Theatre in Yuma, Arizona noticed what at first seemed to be falling stars, but upon following then to observed that to fly horizontal with the ground and then make a very definite abrupt change of attitude displaying in the clouds. Several minutes later two (2) similar objects appeared flying parallel with each other, after a few seconds one continued straight ahead the other veered sharply to the North and passed over the town of Yuma disappearing into the clouds. All the objects sighted which numbered approximately 7 or 8 were travelling from NE to SW, were round and emitted a fiery Red glow, or one occasion after watching this one particular object after it which it had made an abrupt change of attitude it seemed as though it were whirling like a disc.

Being a tower operator and being familiar with Jet Aircraft and other types, I am very sure it could not have been an aircraft or any other object that I have had the experience of seeing before. I have read about other reports on flying, saucers or such, as they are named and can very definitely state that their abrupt change of attitude was not normal, nor was their appearance.
