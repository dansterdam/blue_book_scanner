2. Description of course of object:
   a. It was sighted by the pilot at 2000 ft MSL as he climbed out of Marseille, France on a 3580 Magnetic Heading.
   b. The object was 10° above the horizon at 350°. The distance of the object from the aircraft was estimated at 10 to 50 miles.
   c. The object was 10° above the horizon at 270°. The distance was as mentioned above.
   d. When first sighted, on the climb out, the pilot thought it was another aircraft, however, when it was sighted again at 8500 ft MSL, it was as described in b above.
   e. The object started to move away from the observers as if slowly burning out. The moving away and burning out process took about three seconds. At this time the observers were just north of Montélimar, France, at 3500 ft MSL.
   f. 30 minutes.

The following is from the New York Times of Feb. 20th: "Paris, Feb. 19- Aviation circles were speculating today on the identity of a strange object, alternately hovering and flying at speeds in excess of 1,500 miles per hour, picked up Friday night by radar operators at Orly International Airport. The object made a 'blip' on the radar screen approximately twice as large as that of the average airliner. According to technical claims, it appeared to be at an altitude of about 3,000 feet and was seen by radar in for a finding of Orly. The object was not reported by the observers, but was picked up by radar. Observers reported generally that the object might have been a United States weather balloon launched in Germany and blown."

The number "1956" is handwritten at the top right of the document.

On February 18, the Soviets warned the U.S. that they can now deliver bombs all over the world by either plane or rocket.

On this same date, Paris reported a mystery object in the skies. Described as twice as large as an ordinary commercial air liner, it was tracked on radar screens by Orly Airport officials.

"Travelling at an estimated 1,500 miles an hour, the object appeared over the Paris region late last evening and seemed to hover for a few minutes before disappearing at high speed."

Paris reporter writing from on February 20 said that some radars had caught the blip, others hadn't. He also wrote that an incoming pilot, alerted to the UFO, saw only a winking red fire. The pilot said that

PARIS, FEB. 21--(UP)--THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SOUGHT TODAY TO SOLVE
THE MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM OF ORLY, A GIGANTIC FLYING-SAUCER-LIKE
OBJECT WHICH WHIRLED ACROSS THE AIRPORT'S RADAR SCREEN AT SUPERSONIC
SPEED LAST FRIDAY.

IT WAS THE THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN A YEAR THAT THE "PHANTOM" HAS
BEEN SIGHTED ON RADARSCOPES AT THE BUSY INTERNATIONAL AIRFIELD OUTSIDE
OF PARIS. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF THE
LARGEST KNOWN PLANE, MOVED AT AN ESTIMATED 2,000 MILES AN HOUR,
AND HOVERED AROUND THE AIRPORT FOR ABOUT FOUR HOURS.

THE MYSTERY WAS FURTHER COMPOUNDED WHEN A DETAILED CHECK DISCLOSED
THAT A RADAR EQUIPMENT WAS IN EXCELLENT WORKING CONDITION
A VETERAN AIR FRANCE PILOT REPORTED SPOTTING FLASHING RED LIGHTS
IN THE AREA IN WHICH THE RADAR PLACED THE "PHANTOM" AFTER TAKING OFF
FOR LONDON.

THE REPORTS HAVE SPURRED AN OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION.

NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE, TUESDAY, FEBR [partial date]

Of a Flying Saucer?
Mystery of Paris Sky: Flying Cognac Bottle?
By Frank Kelley
from the Herald Tribune Bureau
PARIS, Feb. 20 - Several French experts are at work trying to find out what was going on in the sky over the outskirts of Paris late last night when radar technicians said they detected and tracked for four hours one or several mysterious objects that might have been a four-engine plane or something else.

Some say it may have been another one, or several, of those American meteorological "balloons" that occasionally wander over. Others blurred waves or "thin" [partial text]
