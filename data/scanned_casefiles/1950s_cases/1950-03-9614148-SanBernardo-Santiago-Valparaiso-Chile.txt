COUNTRY: CHILE
REPORT NO.: IR-42-50
AP-163200-1
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects in Chile 
DATE OF REPORT: 9 Mar 50
DATE OF INFORMATION: Current
EVALUATION: F-0
PREPARED BY: Harry L. Mitchell, Major, USAF
SOURCE: Newspapers, reports and personal observations of Air Attache Office personnel.

1. Flying discs are being "seen" in various parts of Chile. First sighting was at Punta Arenas, 1st 53°06'S, long 70°53'W on 11 Mar at noon. Many inhabitants of the city witnessed phenomena which appeared erratic or "disappearing". Usual description was given - extreme altitude, silver in color, shaped like a ping-pong ball.

2. Second sighting of a disc took place in the Santiago area, San Bernardo and Valparaiso on the 24th and 25th of March with the usual description given by the populace.

3. Third sighting of a disc occurred 28 March between 1330 and 1410 over Santiago. Chileans in the Santiago area reported with people looking into the sky observing this phenomenon. M/Sgt. -, attached to this office as an observer, assigned to a nearby air base of speed and altitude. (See attached statement and diagram.)

COMMENT: On 29 March this observer saw a silver colored, stationary object in the same relative position as was witnessed by the local populace preceding day, and after careful observation it was decided by the local authorities that the object had to be Venus.

Professor Rutland (par 1) repeated his statement to the press today that the object had to be Venus.

The local press has headlined "flying disc" dispatches from all countries reporting sightings.
