This is not something dreamed up, but the feeling generated while watching.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Two unidentified objects were first observed visually and with binoculars at 1615 Pacific Daylight Time, 3 August 1952 for a period of 1 hour and 15 minutes. They were described as silver in color and of circular shape. They were approximately 60-100 feet in diameter traveling at an estimated speed of 400-500 M.P.H. They made no audible sounds. The objects were moving from East to West. One object appeared to be at approximately 12,000 feet and the other at an estimated 15,000 feet. The two objects moved to the West for approximately 15 miles passing overhead of the observers. During the flight several observations were made. At approximately 15,000 feet, the objects were diving at each other. The two unidentified objects disappeared in the run momentarily. The observers then sighted them again. The two flying objects in the approximate location at which they were lost from view, reportedly passed each other at an altitude of 15-20 miles West of the observers. This made a total of 3 similar observations. The additional air flying objects came into view in pairs at altitudes not estimated by the observers. The unidentified objects were reportedly making passes at each other in the manner of a fighter type fight. The observers noted that the objects took up a diamond formation momentarily covering an estimated 4 mile area. No vapor trails, exhaust, or sound was noted on these objects. No jet aircraft. The observers stated that the objects were very one object for any length of time.

The observers were located at their homes on Hamilton AFB, Calif.

The weather officer reports the area as clear during the time of the sightings with approximately 20 miles visibility. Winds were as follows: 12,000 feet, 200° at 16 knots; 15,000 feet, 200° at 19 knots; 20,000 feet, 210° at 23 knots. The observers mentioned that there was some dust in the air at the time of the sightings.

Meteorological activity, physical evidence of the sightings, identification status and aircraft in the area were reported as negative.

Comments of Preparing Officer:
1. The information available to the preparing officer concerning the unidentified objects covered in this report indicates the possibility that the objects sighted were weather balloons.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Two unidentified objects were first observed visually and with binoculars at 1615 Pacific Daylight Time, 3 August 1952 for a period of 1 hour and 15 minutes. They were confirmed at 1621 PDT in color and of circular shape. They were approximately 50-100 feet in diameter traveling at an estimated speed of 100-150 MPH. They made no audible sounds moving from East to West. One object appeared to be at approximately 12,000 feet and the other about 15,000 feet. The two objects moved to the West approximately 15 miles passing over the observers heads, the object at about 18,000 feet altitude. During the flight course over the observers heads, the object at altitude was distinct as the location. When the unidentified objects reached a point about 15 miles West of the observers, they began maneuvering at high speed. The objects were diving at each other. The two unidentified objects disappeared in the sun momentarily. The observers then sighted either two more or the same two flying objects in the approximately 15-mile area at which they were lost from view. During the latter period of the observation six additional objects of similar characteristics were observed.

A total of 8 similar objects observed in this area. These additional six flying objects came into view approximately 4 miles east of the observers. The unidentified were reportedly making passes at each other in the manner of a fighter dog fight. The observers stated that the objects kept up a diamond formation momentarily covering an estimated 4 mile area. The observers stated that the objects were definitely not jet planes. No weather conditions, exchange of signals, or other details of these objects.

The observers were located at their homes on Hamilton AFB, Calif. The observers named Capt. [redacted], Hamilton AFB, Calif. and Capt. [redacted], Hamilton AFB, Calif. and Lt. [redacted] are both experienced pilots.

The weather officer reports the area as clear during the time of the sighting with approximately 20 miles visibility. Wind was as follows: 12,000 feet, 200° at 14 knots; 15,000 feet, 200° at 19 knots; 20,000 feet, 210° at 23 knots. The observers mentioned that there was some dust in the air at the time of the sighting.

Meteorological activity, physical evidence of the sightings, identifications action taken and aircraft in the area were reported as negative.

Statement

4 August 1952

Employed by Fourth Army Finance Office, NOPE, New Orleans, La. as Clerk-Typist.

I would state that at about 9:38 pm on 3 August 1952 while I was in the front of my house on Port Street in the right front seat of my car, I was adjusting the vacuum hose with my right hand and naturally looking through the windshield in a southerly direction. All of a sudden the "Flying Saucer" appeared from the west headed East. It appeared that it was spinning clockwise and bluish-white sparks from a white circle about two feet wide. I was looking at it from about a 45 degree angle. It appeared to be about 3/4 of the distance to the moon from the earth, but only approximately one mile away much closer than the moon. The brother-in-law was on the outside of the car looking north; he did not have an opportunity to see it. I didn't want to get out the car and lose it or miss some of it. I was so stunned that I didn't get an opportunity to tell him about it. It only lasted between thirty to sixty seconds. The sky was hazy in that section of the sky which obscured any stars that may have been in that section; there was a full moon. There were three sets of lighting starting in face from the railroad yard and I could still see the object. I took every precaution to make certain I wasn't being fooled by reflections. The object appeared to be sparks from an empty wheel, spinning very fast. On an empty wheel the sparks only come off in one spot; but this object had sparks all around it.

The object did not leave any trail behind it. Within the circle of the object there was an area. The sparks seemed to coming off about two to three inches from the object. This was the first time I have ever seen anything like it before. The object I saw was traveling about 100 MPH.

California, on the afternoon of August 3, 1952—toward the end of the summer's saucer scare (Chapter VII). As reported in the annals of saucerlore, "two huge silver disks, flying at different altitudes, had raced out of the east. As jet pilots on the ground watched them, the higher machine dived to the other one's level. Then the two saucers began to circle the base, maneuvering like fighter planes in a dogfight." [5, p. 120]

No evidence justifies the use of the words "saucer" or "machine," while ample evidence supports the Air Force conclusion that the UFOs were balloons. The two objects were first seen at 4:15 P.M. Ground observers at the Air Force base, with the aid of binoculars, described them as silver in color, circular in shape, 60 to 100 feet in diameter, and traveling from east to west at an estimated speed of 400 to 450 miles an hour. One object was at about 12,000 feet, the other at about 18,000 feet; as they moved to the west a distance of about fifteen miles, passing over the heads of the observers (but not "circling the base"), the higher object dived to about the level of the lower, and they bobbed about each other in a dogfight. They were in view for about an hour and a quarter. Toward the end of this period they were visible only intermittently because they were seen against the sun; three additional pairs of objects came into view in the same area, fifteen to twenty miles west of the observers (a total of eight objects) and, buffeted by the winds,

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 23--THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
appeared to carry on a dogfight; momentarily they appeared in a
"diamond" formation extending over an area of about four miles.
Since the witnesses were looking into the sun at objects fifteen or
twenty miles away, they found it difficult to follow the course of
any one for any length of time.
The objects looked like balloons, behaved like balloons, and
weather balloons had been released in the area that day. Conclu-
sion: the "machines" were weather balloons [2].
