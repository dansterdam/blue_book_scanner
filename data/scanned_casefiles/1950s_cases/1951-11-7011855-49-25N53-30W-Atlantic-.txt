1. On 3 November 1951, at 0335, R-50 5862, on route from Argentina, Newfoundland, to New York, Maryland, at an altitude of 8,000 Feet, reported sighting a brilliant white fleet which came up through an undercast. Location of the sighting was at 47°05' N, 57°35' W, approximately 60 miles due east of St. Pierre, Pierre Island, a French possession 100 miles south-southeast of Ernest Harmon AFB, Newfoundland.

2. C... Air Airport advised that no other aircraft except the R-50 was in the area at the time of sighting; Halifax, other aircraft were in the area at the time of sighting; and the US Coast Guard at Argentia Naval Station reported that no aircraft or surface vessels under their control were in the area at the time of sighting.

3. Flight B's SA-10 #4058 was dispatched and routed to the area of sighting at 01092. A search of the area was made at an altitude of 1,000 feet. (Further details was not made due to a second incident described further in this report). The pilots, Captain Harold S. Gulin, reported that an additional visibility and with an undercast lying to the south, a scattered four surface vessels were sighted in the area, all approximately light. A powerful rotating white beacon was visible at St. Pierre and lights on the Nova Scotia coastline, over one hundred miles away, were partially seen. The pilot's opinion was that the R-50 pilots were over the edge of the undercast and had been mistaken by the R-50 pilot for a flare.

4. Both the pilot and co-pilot overhead a heavy "B" traffic on "D" channel and, though unable to identify the transmitting aircraft, were convinced that some sort of UFO formation of aircraft were near the area. Voices were described as being unmistakably American.

5. To clarify this incident further, a message was forwarded to the Intelligence Officer at the Patuxent Naval Air Station, Maryland, requesting that the crew of the R-50 be carefully interrogated upon landing. In all details of the sighting, the following answer was received in response to this request:

6. SL-10 #2058 was immediately dispatched to the area and arrived at 0412Z. Conditions omitted and visibility was poor. A small flashing green beacon was visible on an off-shore island. The pilot, however, expressed doubt so another Pan American pilot could have seen the green light from 15,000 feet. He also expressed doubt that it could have been a flare. A low search was made and one small fishing vessel was observed.

7. The overall evaluation of the investigation by Captain Julian was that the extreme visibility, combined with the extreme surface darkness of unlighted areas, prevented many illusions which easily could have confused a pilot.

8. The US Coast Guard at Argentina advised that flares are utilized by water vessels only in cases of distress or emergency.
