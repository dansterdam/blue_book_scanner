Here is the text from the document:

G-ET, Hq, Lackland Millington, Subj: Report of UFO

received by the Staff Duty Officer, Friday evening, 17 April 1959.
The use of advertising searchlights and the heavy aircraft traffic
in this area lead the reporting officer to believe that the object
observed was probably either a searchlight playing on clouds or an
aircraft - in the area at the time. The probability of the object
being an aircraft is further strengthened by the fact that many
Air Training Command aircraft located in the vicinity have bright
orange fluorescent markings which can be seen for great distances.
