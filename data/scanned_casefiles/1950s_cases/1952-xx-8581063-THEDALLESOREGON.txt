25 JUL 52 ELMENDORF AFB, ALASKA
1. 25 July 1952, 2-24, 10028, Pilot: 1st Lt Claine M. Jones (P-2), Radar Observer: 2nd Lt Aubrey M. Branner (CP).
At 0320Z in the area Southeast of Eielson, 62°10' N, 146°45' W, at 11,500 feet, Pilot and CP observed on their radarscope that their aircraft had almost been overtaken by another aircraft which appeared to be traveling about 40 knots or more faster than their own aircraft speed of 350 knots. The target was still pulling away at over 400 knots after being lost by the radar.
(3) A further comment by the Commanding Officer of the Squadron to which the three aircraft are assigned is that "no defects were found in the radar sets aboard any of the three (3) aircraft involved in these reports of unusual radar contacts".
A check of the records in the radar logs show(s) no target returns that could be connected in any way with those obtained by the APO-33.
