25 July 1952, F-94, 50926, Pilots: 1st Lt. Claire M. Jones (B-2), Radar Observer:

UNCLASSIFIED

At 0820Z in the area Southeast of Talkeetna, 62°10' N 149°40' W, at 11,500 feet, a contact was made on a target which appeared larger than an F-94 at 14,000 yards. Lock-on was accomplished at this time with 40 knots greater than that of the aircraft. Aircraft speed was increased to 350 knots in a 1,200 feet per minute climb. The target was still pulling away at over 100 knots. After a climb to 18,500 feet, the target appeared to level off and increase speed. Chase was broken off at this time. Visual sighting was not accomplished.

Weather was: estimated 14,000 feet broken; estimated 25,000 feet overcast with a visibility of 15 miles plus.

A further comment by the Commanding Officer of the Squadron to which the three (3) F-94's are assigned is that "no defects were found in the radar sets aboard any of the three (3) aircraft involved in these reports of unusual radar contacts".

A check of the records in the ADDC shows no target returns that could be connected in any way with those obtained by the AFG-33.
