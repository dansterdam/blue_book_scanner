3 June 1952
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
PLACE OBSERVED: Near Guayaquil, Ecuador
DATE/TIME: 13 August 1952
USAF MISSION TO ECUADOR
AT 2200-4, six airmen saw 50 to 60 objects hovering at approximately 30,000 feet. They were elliptical in shape and a reddish-orange in color, and were sighted for about 30 minutes. The objects were seen from an estimated distance of 10 miles and maintained a standard formation at that distance. No outstanding maneuvers were observed, and the objects appeared to hover and then slowly vanish from sight. The objects were observed from an estimated altitude of 6,000 to 7,000 feet.
W/Sgt. H. J. PAISLEY's findings are considered to be worthy of investigation.

DETAILS:
1. This investigation is opened at the UNITED STATES District COMMANDER, LUKE Air Force Base, New Mexico, by 1st Lt. WILLIAM L. McCLELLAND, Assistant Adjutant, Sandia Base, New Mexico, concerning the OBSERVATION of an unidentified AERIAL OBJECT by Captain CLAUDE W. MCELWAIN.
AT ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO
2. The following report was made by Captain CLAUDE W. McELWAIN of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Sandia Base, New Mexico:
"At approximately 19:30 MST on 3 August 1952 while car riding with my family, my son and I, we saw, noticed a brilliant glow in the sky. It was the first time of its occurrence that I observed it through the binoculars. (I make an observation to this effect through the binoculars - noted) The object appeared oval shaped with an appendage, it seemed to be going out of sight, then in sight, it was all lit up. By comparison and without any evidence of known factors, the object looked about like an illumination of about 200 yards, when it disappeared I did not observe any sound."
This object was observed from approximately 19:30 MST to 19:40 MST on 3 August 1952. Other witnesses present were Mr. and Mrs. JACKSON who live on the corner of Chaver and Northeast Avenue, Albuquerque, New Mexico, a Security Guard at Sandia Base, and a number of children.
Captain McELWAIN furnished sketches as to his observation of the object, and his location which are being attached as an inclosure to this report.
