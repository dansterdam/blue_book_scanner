AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Flying Objects

Place: Juan Isidel, Ecuador

Date of Observation: 2/June 1952     Date of Report: 3 August 1952

While on TDY at Guayaquil, Ecuador, M/Sgt observed flying objects unconventional by present standing 50 Feet Island, Ecuador. The objects appeared to be approximately 50 Feet in diameter. Two objects seen from an estimated distance of ten miles and maintained an estimated altitude from 30,000 to 40,000 feet. No known meteorological disturbances could be cited for the sighting.

M/Sgt is considered to be reliable, his observations are considered of sufficient significance to be worthy of investigation.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation is opened at the UNCLASSIFIED District Commander, predicated upon information furnished by 1st WILLIAM L. McCLELLAND, Assistant Adjutant, Sandia Base, New Mexico, concerning the observation of an unidentified aerial object by Captain CLAUDE W. McELWAIN.

* AT ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO

2. The following report was made by Captain CLAUDE W. McELWAIN of Field Command, Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Sandia Base, New Mexico:

"At approximately 1930 MST on 3 August 1952 while car riding with my family, we were ago west, noticed a brilliant glow in the western skies. At first I was willing to discount it, as the evening star. Then I decided to observe it through the binoculars (7 x 50). We observed it for about 15 minutes. The object appeared, to the naked eye, to be an unusually bright star and at first to be moving or motionless, with the glasses it appeared oval shaped with an appendage tail or exhaust to the right of the main body. It disappeared behind the horizon. By comparison and without reference or known factors, the object looked about 11 km an amber head light of an automobile at a distance of about 300 yards, when looking at the head light from an angle not head on. There was just one object and appeared to be going due west. This object was observed from about 1930 to 1945 MST 3 August. My location was Buena Vista at Anderson Avenue about six blocks due north of the Lovelace Clinic, city of Albuquerque. If this object was 5,000 feet its speed could have been 1700 - 1800 mph. The size would be hard to determine under the circumstances. I do not feel that I have any particular qualifications as an observer but I try to be realistic and practical in my observation and projection of the mental image. I do have over ten years of active military service and did take a course in aircraft identification in 1942. I was on duty with the Air Force for three years. The sky was very clear with the exception of a few scattered cloud banks. The wind was about 20 mph, from the east. The sun was gone but is was not dark yet. I am no metallic or physical objects at all. There was no fragment of sound that I was able to detect. I carry two pairs of binoculars and two cameras at all times and did not feel that, due to the distance involved, a photograph could be taken with either of the two types of cameras I have. This observation was reported to Major ELLIOT, Intelligence and Security Division, at approximately 2000 MST 3 August 1952 and to Major WADE on 4 August 1952. Other witnesses present were Mr. and Mrs. JACKSON who live at the corner of Buena Vista and Anderson, Albuquerque, (he is a Security Guard at Sandia Base) Mr. and Mrs. BELL and a number of children."

3. Captain McELWAIN furnished sketches as to his observation of the object and his location, which are being attached as an inclosure to this report.
