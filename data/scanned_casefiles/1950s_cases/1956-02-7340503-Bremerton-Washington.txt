The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project 10073 Record Card from Project Blue Book, which was the US Air Force's systematic study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The card provides details about a UFO sighting that occurred on 11 February 1956 in Bremerton, Washington. The sighting involved a single round object, estimated to be three feet across and traveling at an estimated speed of 600 mph. The observer reported that the object gave out a light blue streak and seemed to give out a light. The card includes details about the location, type of observation, source, course, and conclusions about the sighting.
