e. Total cover: 1/10, low cover: 3/10.

f. Time.

g. Nothing unusual.

j. OSI, 6th Collection Branch, "Inspector of Installations, HQ 14th Air Division, APO 334, San Francisco, California.

k. As a result of the interview and interrogation of the observer named in para E, it is my opinion that at no time did the 3 aircraft reported have been an UFO no indication indicated any unusual aspect of an optical or electronic malfunction of the data generated. Also, due to the unextensive nature of the object(s) and the short time observed, the accuracy of the descriptive data is somewhat questionable.

l. Preliminary investigation with ATIC and Control Tower records gave no indication that the observation made was caused by a misidentified aircraft or 'natural' phenomena.
