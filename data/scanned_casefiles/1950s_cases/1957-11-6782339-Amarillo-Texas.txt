Interception or identification action taken (such action may be taken whenever feasible, complying with existing air defense directives).

(1) Checked weather for balloon launching. An SCR-584 radar balloon was launched at 22:06 17 Nov 57, but should have been about 55 miles east of the Amarillo area.

3. Location of any air traffic in the area at time of sighting.

(1) Normal IFR traffic - exact location not known.

k. The following comment is submitted by the Operations Officer 688th AC&W Squadron, Emmet E. Solley, Captain, USAF:

There has been a rash of such sightings in this area in the past month and a lot of publicity about the so-called unidentified flying objects. This publicity has made many people conscious of such things and we are deluged with reports, most of which appear to be the planet Venus, stars, and such natural phenomena.
