OBJECT SIGHTED OVER CALIFORNIA
BY CHEMICAL SUPERINTENDENT

No explanation has been found to date
for the UFO sighted May 21 by Don Martin,
superintendent of the Ventura Chemical
Division Plant in Chula Vista, California.
Martin and another Westwood company
employee reported seeing a white, round

object somewhere near its southwest tip of
San Diego Bay.

"The object glittered in the sun and
followed an irregular path," Martin told
Chula Vista police. He said he watched
it as "it came in over the Silver Strand,
traveled east and doubled back west. Then
it just disappeared."

Martin and a fellow employee, William

Blackwell, said they watched the object
measure for more than 45 minutes. Black-
well said the UFO "looked like a silver
dollar at times."

Martin watched the UFO through bin-
oculars and said that it appeared round
the size but still metal with the structure.
He reported the observation to the Chula
Vista police.

(11) INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, MSTLT, THE NEAREST GOC SITE (ART) DID NOT
PAINT THE OBJECT, HOWEVER THE OBJECT WAS SITED IN AN AREA WHERE ART
HAS A BLIND SPOT AND DOES NOT GET DETECTION ON ALL AIRCRAFT IN THE
VICINITY. FROM THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT SHAPE AND LENGTH OF TIME
OBSERVED IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS EITHER AN AIRPLANE OR
RATHER BALLOON. THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SMALL AIRCRAFT
IN THIS VICINITY. (12) NEGATIVE.
