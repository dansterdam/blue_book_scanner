Dear Sir:

today evening at 11:25 p.m. I saw from my home (and other witnesses were present at the same time on our block) a light in the sky. It looked like a star or planet but it kept on moving rapidly, in a circular orbit, suddenly speeding up and then slowing down. In doing this, it also seemed to go up and down in elevation, as though it was following a curved path. After doing this for 5 to 10 minutes, it suddenly took off at a very high speed, going in a straight line toward the northeast and disappearing in the distance in a matter of a few seconds.
I heard no roaring noise in the sky. I looked up just as the object was completing its circular motion and heading out toward the northeast. There were other people out on our street at the time who, in turn, also saw the brilliantly glowing object moving rapidly through the sky. I was able to observe it for a matter of 5 to 10 minutes and it definitely was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known object. Its motion was unlike anything I had ever seen before, and I feel quite certain that it was some kind of unidentified flying object. There is no doubt in my mind that this was not an hallucination or a jet plane. I have no idea what it could have been, unless it was possibly a jet plane. However, the appearance and motion were so completely different from that of a jet plane that I am convinced it was not. I would appreciate any information you could give me regarding this incident.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

4707TH AIR BASE GROUP
STRATEGIC AIR FORCE BASE
READING, NEW YORK
OPERATIONS STAFF OFFICE
3 June 1954

Mr. [Redacted]
[Redacted], Pennsylvania

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

In reply to your letter of May 19, 1954, I wish to commend you for your interest concerning the alleged unidentified object you and your wife observed in the sky.

I have no doubts of your being sound of mind, and I shall answer your questions concerning the above-mentioned sighting. As to whether or not such "so-called aircraft" do not make violent movements such as the object you saw, I must say that aircraft do not make violent movements as the object would suggest was a rather weather balloon or some other weather device used in recording wind aloft and other data that is necessary prior to undertaking the global all-weather forecast that we have in being today.

Your home location on the ridges surrounding Reading, Pennsylvania, also would preclude any military aircraft operating in the area. Also, I might add that weather balloons have been known to travel in excess of 200 miles per hour. Due to the tremendous ground-speed resulting, Pennsylvania.

I would like to say in closing that I do not believe you saw a flying saucer; however, I again wish to commend you for your alertness. I hope I have given you a reasonable answer to your questions.

Very truly yours,

s/ CLARK E. VAN EPPS
Major, USAF
Operations Staff Officer
