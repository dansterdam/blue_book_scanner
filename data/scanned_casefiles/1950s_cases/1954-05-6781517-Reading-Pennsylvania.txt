Dear Sir:

Monday evening at 11:20 p.m. I came home from work, and, as usual, put the car away in our garage behind our house. As I shut the doors on the garage, I heard a roaring noise in the sky. I looked up in the sky and saw a glowing white object, slowly maneuvering around in a circle above me. Then suddenly the roar ceased, and the object started moving rapidly toward the moon, which at the time was in westward position. Seeing it was moving away from me, I very quickly scanned the sky, who, in turn, also saw the brilliantly glowing object, over just the moon. Staying only a few seconds, she merely went inside and awakened my father. He also came quickly, but all he saw was the bright object, which at this time looked exactly like a star. I then went into the house and called the Reading Eagle-Times office and asked whether anyone else had seen a strange looking object in the sky. They said they had reports like that every week, that I shouldn't get excited, that it was probably a jet plane.

I am a boy 17 years of age and of very sound mind. I've seen jets fly before, and I know that a jet could not be maneuvered like the object in the sky. Secondly, why would a jet plane be glowing so brilliantly, as this object was? Also, planes always have white or colored lights on their wings. I will not say what I saw was a flying saucer. But this, I am sure, is not a jet plane, nor any other kind of man-made air-borne object. I will also say, though, that the object was really there.

Please believe everything I have told you; this is no hoax, or made up story for publicity.

SYOSSET AIR FORCE BASE
NEWBURGH, NEW YORK
OPERATIONS STAFF OFFICE

OPRS/CBY/cg
3 June 1954

Mr. [redacted]
Rt. Penn
Reading, Pennsylvania

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

In reply to your letter of May 11, 1954, I wish to commend you for your interest as well as your proper thinking in notifying military authorities concerning the alleged unidentified object you saw in the sky.

I have no doubts of your being sound of mind, and I shall try to answer your questions concerning the above-mentioned subject. As to whether the object was from another planet, I would say the answer is "no". Jet aircraft do not make violent movements such as the object you saw. However, it is very possible that what you saw was a radar weather balloon or some other weather device used in recording winds aloft and other data that is so necessary in maintaining the global all-weather Air Force that we have in being today. I noticed on my map that your home town of Reading, Pennsylvania is in close proximity to Allentown, Pennsylvania, where the Civil Aeronautics Authority has a weather station, Also, I might add that weather balloons have been known to travel in excess of 200 miles. Due to the terrain features around Reading, Pennsylvania, it is very possible that one of this type of balloon could rise or fall due to up-drafts and down-drafts in the air.

I would like to say in closing that I do not believe you saw a flying saucer— however, I again wish to commend you for your alertness. I hope I have given you a reasonable answer to your questions.

Very truly yours,

s/c CLARK B. VAN LEUSSEN
Major, USAF
Operations Staff Officer
