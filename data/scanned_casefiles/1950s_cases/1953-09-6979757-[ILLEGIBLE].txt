AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Directorate of Intelligence
Headquarters 5th Air Division                                   PAGE    2   OF    2

1. An unidentified flying object was sighted at Sidi Slimane Air Base (34°16'N
09°50'W), 2 September 1953, at 2111 hours by the crew of a USAF C-47 on a routine
training flight. The crew observed an unusually bright white light which appeared to
be larger than an ordinary aircraft navigation light. Shape of the object could not be
determined and no sound was audible.

2. The object was first sighted by the co-pilot at 2111 hours which was called to
the attention of the pilot. The light was first observed at an estimated altitude of
about 4,000 feet above the G-47. The object was very fast and followed a near collision course in relation to the G-47. The approaching object, when
level with the G-47, executed a 180° descending turn at an unestimated high speed.
Turned in second 1800 turn, the object decreased to 7/8 fast or less. While descending, the object definitely decreased in speed, then made a 90° turn toward the main
highway that parallels Sidi Slimane Air Base at which point it appeared stationary.
The light then disappeared.

3. The observers flew the G-47 in a 3600 circle in order to continue observation
of the object. The light could be sighted at all times by the observers and was seen
for approximately three minutes. The G-47's speed was 140 mph at an altitude of 6,000
feet. The nearest point at which the object was observed was between one-quarter and
one-half mile distance, while an estimated distance of approximately one object
mile. Visibility during sighting was 20 miles plus. The sky was clear with no moon.
Winds were calm.

4. Sidi Slimane Control Tower was contacted when the object was first sighted and
reported no aircraft in the vicinity.

5. Air Traffic Control at Casablanca, French Morocco, was contacted and reported
approximately 25 miles from Sidi Slimane Air Base. No other aircraft in the vicinity of Port Lyautey or
Sidi Slimane was reported.

6. The SGUIN Group was imperative during report sighting of unidentified
flying object. The report was forwarded from the 2nd Bde Hq, Port Lyautey, through
Naval Station at Port Lyautey. The Naval Station at Port Lyautey further reported same imperative during report sighting of unidentified object.

7. The following were crew members of the USAF G-47:
Lt Colonel Wilson Moore, 4227A, 3,900 hours flying time.
Lt Col T. Jamie R. MacInnis, 40 191079, 900 hours flying time.
