WASHINGTON D.C.

Sir,

While on vacation here I saw early this morning low over the horizon a faint flickering light for which I could not account, and I feel that I should report it. It was certainly not an aircraft, and followed the irregular pattern on the enclosed sketch. The elapsed time in passing from east to south-east was perhaps two minutes.

Yours very truly,

(Col., British Army)

MEMO ROUTING SLIP

Remarks:
Larry Gregory suggests the following for use in answering:

1. We can not reach a firm conclusion on the basis of a single report which does not contain all the elements necessary for evaluation.

2. We have checked and find that radar, Ground Observer Corps, civil airlines, military bases, and other agencies in the area received no reports of unusual activity at the given time.

3. This report will be added to our continuing study of aerial phenomena and we sincerely appreciate its interest in forwarding it.

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 25 March 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object sighting on that date.

A check of radar, Ground Observer Corps, civil airlines, military bases and other agencies in the area failed to reveal any reports of unusual activity in the area that day.

For your information I am enclosing a copy of the latest Department of Defense Fact Sheet on this subject, dated 5 November 1957.

Thank you again for your interest.
