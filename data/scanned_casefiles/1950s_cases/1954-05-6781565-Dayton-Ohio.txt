Dayton, Ohio
This memo summarizes an interview with Pete Kime on 2-28-53. The interview consisted of two men, allegedly from Greenfield, Ohio, who obtained "scientific" information concerning three UFO sightings. They stated that from 3,500 reports, 450 were selected for further study. The weather scores 12,900 sightings; 31,925 sightings were cataloged, and 15 million cases were handled monthly.
See OIN7 officers report for additional input.

First time we saw this thing was on Memorial Day at a Drive-In Theater (Sherwood) My husband and some friends that we were visiting from Cleveland was a couple of cars over from us. Apparently one straight down like a round object. It was flat and round. She said she screamed so loud that it attracted some attention at the theater.
She didn't report it because people would think she was crazy. We bothtrihg out then the Air Force was most
There weren't know thatthe thing remained inyirible. There was no end to what some friends said that they think the end time is coming. Which I assured her it wasn't.

The image contains two sketches:

1. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with a drawing of an object above the horizon line. The instructions indicate that the viewer should imagine they are at the point shown, and draw on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it.

2. The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene, with a person standing on a road or path in the foreground. There are two smaller inset sketches - one showing a similar landscape scene, and another showing a road or path leading towards the horizon.

As an OCR system, I will now extract the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
