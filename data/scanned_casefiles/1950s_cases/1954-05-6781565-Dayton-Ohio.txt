First time we saw this thing was on Memorial Day at a Drive-In Theater (Sherwood) My husband and some friends that we visiting from Cleveland was a couple of cars over from me. Approximately 8:45-9:00. Coming straight down like a round object would go making a funny looking design as it came down. All at once it stopped and went slow to the right. Then it stopped. Then it took off real crazy and I told my husband that I saw a flying object. It was flat, and round. She said she screamed so loud that it attracted some attention at the Theater.

She didn't report it because people would think she was crazy. Although she was frightened, she had heard a report that the Air Force was putting funny looking things into the sky, maybe for some new experiment. So she didn't think anything about that anymore until she read the paper and saw that article. She told a couple of friends and they laughed at her.

Then she saw something again last night. It went right across the window just like a great big something and she couldn't sleep very well. She has an upstairs apartment. It was around 3 in the morning. An airplane couldn't come down that low. Made a type of noise like something passing real fast right across the window. Some friends said they think the end of time is coming, Which I assured her it wasn't.
