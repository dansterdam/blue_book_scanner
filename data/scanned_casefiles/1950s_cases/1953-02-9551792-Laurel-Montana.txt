1. Object appeared to be star like, only quite a bit larger, with a bluish, greenish color. It would fade and then grow brighter, or appeared to twinkle at times. Traveled slowly to the west from first sighting and moved up and down slightly while in flight. There was some unusual features. There was only one object seen. The shape was round as described by both observers. The altitude was unknown but guessed at about 3,000 ft.

2. Mr [redacted] first sighted the object about 1900/1925, he watched for quite a while then called the observation post an informed the observers on duty about 0200. Mr [redacted] lost sight of the object about 0300 after he had traveled about one (1) mile west of Laurel. The observer, Mr [redacted], watched the object from about 0425 till about 0450. He was on top of a two (2) story building which might become for the longer sighting.

3. The manner of observation was only by eye sight. Mr [redacted] tried to contact the owner of a local observatory but was unable to, so couldn't look at the object through a telescope.

The object I saw Sat 10 at 9:10 PM was starlike, blinking, bluish green, and slightly to northwest of Laurel when I first saw. "It was traveling slow, almost directly west and went over the horizon at near 9:30 PM. I could hear no sound of any kind. It was moving very slightly in an up & down motion as it traveled out of sight. I drove about 1 mile west of Laurel, and observed the light for the past 15 minutes to was in sight, to prove for my own satisfaction that it was something besides an ordinary light.
