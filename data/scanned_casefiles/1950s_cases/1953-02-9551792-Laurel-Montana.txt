1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 17/0317Z
2. LOCATION: Laurel, Montana
10. CONCLUSION: Probably Astro (USAF)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Large round object, bright, saucer-like and oval in shape. It made very rapid and erratic movements. Witness claims it was traveling at tremendous speed. It hovered and then sped away in a north-easterly direction at a high rate of speed. It was visible for approximately 15-20 minutes. The object appeared to be structured as it did not seem to be weather or atmospheric phenomenon. A check of astronomical conditions indicates the object was probably an astronomical phenomenon, most likely a satellite or star.

Transcription of the text in the document:

At 8:45 a.m. a very bright light was observed crossing the sky from the north to south. It was estimated to be travelling at a rather slow rate of speed as it crossed the sky in about 7-8 seconds. The light appeared to be oval-shaped and had a greenish-blue color. It was a rather clear day with a few scattered clouds in the sky.

The object I saw felt to me 9:10 P.M. was tangible, thinking, silent, green, and slightly to the southwest of Laurel what had seen. It was nothing like an airplane directly west and was the height of a hanger at near 9:30 P.M. I could hear no sound. It was moving very slightly in an up and down motion and it seemed to be lit. I drove about 1 mile to the west to a hill and observed the light for about 15 minutes. It was in sight. The glow for my own satisfaction that it was something very eerie and out of the ordinary.

The image appears to contain a hand-written text and a sketch or diagram. The text describes an observation of a UFO-like object that was seen at around 7:45 PM, which seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed and near the ground. The text also mentions a phone call placed to a person named "Mr. [redacted]" who also allegedly saw the object.

The sketch or diagram appears to be a downgraded or declassified image of some sort, possibly related to the UFO observation described in the text. The text "UNCLASSIFIED" is written above and below the sketch.

As per the instructions, I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document, without identifying any humans mentioned:

AT 8:51-5
