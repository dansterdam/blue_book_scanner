TITLE: UFO's in Sweden
TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

1. During the month of December 1958, there was reported a UFO sighting near Göteborg, Sweden. In January 1959, the Air Attaché in Stockholm requested USAFE AIT cooperation with Swedish Air Force intelligence officers in evaluating the circumstances of the reported sighting. The AIT representative joined the Swedish group in classifying the reported sighting as a deliberate hoax. There was no intelligence report submitted by this Directorate since it was decided that the verbal report rendered by the AIT representative upon his return to this Headquarters was sufficient.

2. The ATI representative was shown secret Swedish Air Force reports indicating that many of the reported UFO sightings are Soviet attempts to test Swedish radar and other defensive installations.

3. Up to now, Swedish Air Force Intelligence has been able to discount all except one reported UFO sightings in Sweden as deliberate hoaxes or Soviet prying attempts. This one was a phenomenon observed over the Swedish island of Gotland on 15 October 1957. The case was a sighting of so-called "angel's hair" which was drifting in a northwesterly direction over the island. Some "naira" were found and analyzed chemically at the University of Uppsala. They were shown to be essentially spun natural silk with no mechanical stress. Swedish Air Force Intelligence experts pointed out that the case is similar to the "angel hair" cases reported by Keyhoe in his book, "The Flying Saucer Conspiracy," on Page 227.

4. The Chief of the Swedish Air Force Intelligence requested the ATI representative to ascertain through ATIC IF there were any logical and natural explanations of this phenomenon, such as high altitude A- or H-bursts, high altitude balloons, etc.

5. (   ) Inasmuch as there is excellent cooperation between USAF and Swedish Air Force Intelligence on several projects of interest, it is requested that any information which can throw light on this matter be forwarded to this Directorate to be included in a briefing to Swedish Air Force Intelligence.

6. (   ) This correspondence is classified because of intelligence cooperation between two governments. Downgrading date cannot be determined.

1. The only case in the ATIC files which can in any way be associated with a Swedish sighting case occurred on 1 October 1957 at Maywood, California on 1 February 1954.

2. The witness described the object as round, shiny, silver colored, luminous, hazy or clouy looking around the edges. When filled, the object appeared ball-shaped and a radiant red-orange in color. Object was in sight approximately 50 seconds.

3. The witness alleged that a residue or substance of some sort would evaporate upon contact with air. This residue, which was put in a jar and the sample forwarded to the ATIC was put in a beaker. Laboratory analysis of the material indicated that it was a cobweb.

4. Contact with the Taft Sanitary Engineering Center, Air Pollution Division, Cincinnati, Ohio reveals that residues from textiles, nylon, and other such materials have on instances been polluted with a fibrous material which, due to a relatively high static electric charge, tends to cling together. This material, being a light, has been handled. A factory from which this material originates normally has a very poor or no filtering system.

5. It is suggested that the area of the Swedish sightings be investigated for a silk processing plant. There are several possible causes for this material to be in an area where it probably has not been seen before:

a. Filtering system of a nearby plant has broken down.
b. Greek wind blowing from a direction entirely uncommon to the area.
