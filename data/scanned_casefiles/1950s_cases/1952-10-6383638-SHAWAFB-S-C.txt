1. In accordance with AF Ltr. AFCIG-CO-1, dated 8 September 1950, the following report of Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft is submitted:

    a. Description: A brilliant white light, three times as intense as the stars, of sharp contrast, brilliance not diminishing toward edges, with no halo or radiation circular in shape, and comparable size approximately one (1) inch in diameter. No discernible aerodynamic features, trail or exhaust, propulsion system or sound. Speed undetermined, but considerably greater than six times the aircraft. Object exhibited following maneuvers: Horizontal flight, vertical flight, still flight, gentle turns, abrupt turn and dive. Sighting aircraft lost contact with object in maneuvering to avoid another aircraft.

    b. Object was sighted at 1537 hours, Eastern Standard Time, 1 October 1952, and remained in visual contact until a proximately 1920 hours, EST.

    c. Object was observed from one RF-80 aircraft traveling at 270 MPH indicated at 22,000 feet MSL during first part of contact, and at time of disappearance sighting aircraft was indicating 370 MPH at 16,000 feet MSL.

    d. Location of sighting aircraft: 34° 08'N - 80° 34'W on heading of 060° at time of sighting and remained on above heading for approximately 10 minutes. Object appeared to left of aircraft nose at 2 o'clock position, came to what appeared to be a complete stop, resumed flight in opposite direction passing in front of aircraft, coming to a stop at 10 o'clock to the sighting aircraft. Object remained slightly below altitude of sighting aircraft during entire contact.

SUBJECT: Report of Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft

a. There were no known witnesses or other observers. Object sighted by, 1st. Lt. Thomas J. Piontek, Rated Pilot of four (4) years experience with approximately 1100 Flying hours; is a veteran of combat operations in the Korean War, is at present assigned as the additional duty of Assistant Squadron Intelligence Officer, 156th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, is considered to be a highly qualified reconnaissance pilot and a sober and reliable officer.

f. Weather during period was clear with a full moon. (Teletype Sequence attached as Incl. #1).

g. No physical evidence of object is available.

h. Pilot attempted to intercept object after second pass in front of sighting aircraft, by cutting in front of path of object and increasing power to 100% but was unable to close on object. Pilot also attempted to alert ground radar unit for electronic observation of object but was unsuccessful.
