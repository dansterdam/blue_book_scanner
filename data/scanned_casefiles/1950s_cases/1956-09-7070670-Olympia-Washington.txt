PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 5 September 1956

2. LOCATION: Olympia, Washington

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 06/04:222

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. SOURCE: Civilian

6. PHOTOS: No

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Forty minutes

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: two

9. COURSE: South to northeast

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two round bluish/white objects, size of a dime at arm's length. Course of objects was dgr from 25 dgr elevation South to 25 dgr elevation Northeast. Objects arced to 30dgr elevation during flight. Objects were observed visually & thru binoculars for 40 minutes and disappeared by fading out of sight. Another phenomena was reported with supposedly related to the sighting i.e. an explosion without any noise and sheet of light following the explosion.

12. CONCLUSIONS:
- Possibly Balloon
- Possibly Aircraft
- Possibly Astronomical

COMMENTS: Cause of sighting was possibly a balloon. Size, shape, color, wind direction, course, and duration substantiate this hypothesis. The conflicting fact that there were two objs can be accounted for by the possibility of 2 balloons or that thru binoculars a single balloon light could be mistaken for two balloon lights. Concluded that "explosion and sheet of light" not related to initial sighting. Probably shooting star which exploded at 04:40Z & rptd by jet pilot.

The rest of the text appears to be blurred or illegible. The document has several vertical holes punched along the right side and appears to be a vintage document with some degradation of image quality.
