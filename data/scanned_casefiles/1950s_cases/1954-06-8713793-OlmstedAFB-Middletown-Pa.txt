At 0742 eastern standard time base operations called and told us about the the object and told us to take pictures of it. We spotted the object right away and began taking pictures. The first roll was used up so incase the film wasn't any good,as it had been in the camera for quite some time, the second roll was taken. The object was as described in form 1, Round with the what appeared to be a string hanging from the bottom. It was first spotted to the sw, it appeared to be moving away and slightly to the right. The object was below the clouds which the weather department estimated to br 31,000 feet. There was no appreciable movement or change in color,size or shape during the time it was in sight. At 0932 eastern standard time the object disappeared from sight. It seemed to disappear in the distance. In my opinion the object was a balloon.
