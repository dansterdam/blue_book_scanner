The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows the trajectory of an observed object, with instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on the curved line. The second sketch shows two larger views, one depicting a road with surrounding landscape, and another showing a silhouetted person on a horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, but it does not contain any photographs. The text on the page describes an unidentified object that was observed and reported to the Air Force. According to the report, the object was initially observed by an eastern standard time, and it was described as shaped like a string hanging from the bottom. The object was below the clouds, which were estimated to be at 31,000 feet, and it disappeared from sight after a short period of time.

U. S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the interrogation, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: (Do Not Write in This Space)
SIGNATURE:
DATE: 15 June 1954

At 0742 eastern standard time the object was first spotted and told us about the object and told us to take pictures of it. We spotted the object right away and began taking pictures. The first roll was used up to increase the film wasn't any good as it had been in the camera for some time, the second roll was taken. The object was as described in form A. Bound with the what appeared to be a string hanging from the bottom. It was first spotted to the east, it appeared to be moving away and slightly to the right. The object was below the clouds which the weather department estimated to be 31,000 feet. There was no appreciable movement or change during the time it was in sight. At 0932 eastern standard time the object disappeared from sight. It seemed to disappear in the distance. In my opinion the object was a balloon.
