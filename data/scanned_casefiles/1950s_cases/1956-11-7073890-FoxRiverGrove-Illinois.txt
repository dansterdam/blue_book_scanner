When I first saw it, it looked fairly far away. It was hovering in one position. The color was a dull red. It hovered for five minutes. Then it sped up quickly in a southeast to North course (150° to 300°). As it built up speed the color turned to a bright red. The speed was at least 1000 m.p.h. (I figured out its speed by this method, about a week before I saw this thing) I saw a jet plane, F-86, break the sound barrier. There was a great thunder clap. And a short time later, this was another one. The

There are some additional small time or angle notations on the curved lines of the celestial dome diagram, but they are too small or blurry to confidently transcribe.

The image appears to be a diagram showing a celestial sphere with a horizon line and compass/directional markings, with a stylized cityscape or landscape at the bottom of the image.

speed of sound is about 720 m.p.h. and I know the object was going much faster than that. The object was pretty far away and it still moving very fast. The altitude that I stated was just a guess. If it was an air plane it could have to be fairly high for you not to hear its engines). It flew along for a time getting redder and redder. At the end of its flight it turned into a shape of a cigar (P.3). Three small round objects came from an extra dark part of the sky (probably a cloud) and merged into the bigger cigar shaped object. The one big object flew on for a few seconds and then just disappeared. There were no wings tail or exhaust showing that I could see. Seen by [redacted]
