[Handwritten note at bottom of page, partially legible]
Hope being observed for 30 minutes. This GOC observer could give very
well information. He didn't know from what direction it came, or
its what direction if disappeared. This is the time of report personally.
This is the time GOC observer, all he could give. [rest of note is difficult to fully read]
