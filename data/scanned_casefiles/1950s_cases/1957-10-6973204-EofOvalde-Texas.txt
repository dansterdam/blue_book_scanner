(Handwritten notes)
This cot seemed to have come through the atmosphere slowly and with a series of jerk-like motions. It came from the direction of the west and moved toward the east. It seemed to be illuminated possibly by its own light, and as it proceeded it began to flicker as if the source of its light was about to fail. As it moved along it seemed to be on the verge of going out. It finally faded from sight.
