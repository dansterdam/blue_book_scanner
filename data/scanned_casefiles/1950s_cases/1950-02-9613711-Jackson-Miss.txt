SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

Preparing Office: P. O. Box 2502
                 Jackson, Mississippi

Subject: Sighting of Supposed "Flying Saucers"
          Jackson, Miss.

Date: 27 Feb 1950

[Reliability and Information Source Evaluation Boxes - mostly blank]

Summary of Information:

Mrs. [redacted] housewife, reported sighting two "flying saucers" Friday afternoon, February 24, 1950, at approximately 1500 to 1530 hours, heading in a Westerly direction, maintaining equidistance between them at all times. Mrs. [redacted], during personal interview with agent, stated that these two objects, her judgement, the objects were approximately three quarters of a mile high at time of sighting, were flying in a vertical position (compared to an ordinary china saucer), were silver in color, and gave off a vapor trail similar to that given off by sky-writing planes, except not quite as dark in color. Mrs. [redacted] stated that the objects did not rise above the horizon, but merely faded into the distance, and further that the information contained in the attached newspaper article re the "zig-zagging" of one of the objects at time of its disappearance, was not correct.

Mrs. [redacted] stated that only the vapor trail of the object appeared to zig-zag. Her deviation from the pattern was observed just about the time the two objects disappeared from sight. The two objects produced a steady drone unlike the sound made by conventional aircraft.

Interview with Mr. George Fish, meteorologist, U. S. Weather Bureau, Jackson, Miss., revealed that the two objects seen by Mrs. [redacted] as indicated above, could not have been weather balloons released in this vicinity, as graph readings from local balloons indicated travel by same in the opposite direction of the objects sighted by Mrs. [redacted].

Jackson Woman 'Vows She Sees 'Fantastic' Saucers'

A Jackson woman who sighted two "flying saucers" said "it was the most fantastic thing I have ever seen."

Mrs. Ed Morgan, prominent Jackson woman and resident of the Old Canton Highway, said she and her yard boy were working Friday afternoon while working in her yard.

"The yard boy and I were at resting. Flowers in the yard where I noticed he was transfixed, looking at the sky," Mrs. Morgan said. "Those things came out of the sky and appeared as a blue, round object," she added.

Describing the two "saucers" as about the size of a bird bath in her yard, Mrs. Morgan said they were traveling very high from such a low altitude as a little north of the shopping center in North Jackson.

The two objects also traveled in a straight line and kept the same distance apart. Just before disappearing from sight one of them appeared to stop and hover. They seemed irregular. They were sighted between 1 and 3:30 p.m. Friday and the sky was clear at the time.

The objects also gave off a steady roar but the sound was not like that of a conventional type aircraft, Mrs. Morgan said. The Negro helper said the strange objects had been seen frequently in the Mississippi Delta. Mrs. Morgan quoted the Negro as saying they were always working in the cotton field, most of the time near some cotton run for shelter "because they were so frightened."

Reports of "flying saucers" are frequent in the South recently, especially on clear days. There has been no official explanation of such objects.
