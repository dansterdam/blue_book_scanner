Attention: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) Division

Dear Sirs:

I wish to report an unusual "sighting" made last evening by my wife and I from the top of the hill in which we live.

We had gone up on the roof about 11 p.m. and were about to descend when we both saw, almost from the instant of its first appearance, "rose" in an object which seemed like a very distant ball and which moved at a very fast rate of speed. From horizon to horizon, it moved from west to east, disappearing over the eastern horizon, and no noise of any kind accompanied it.

It was during in color and its constant size seemed about that of Jupiter, well up in the sky; Venus was clearly visible, and very white, a little north of west of where it stood. I thought the object was orange in the direction of yellow in the spectrum; my wife thought it was reddish orange (we were a little excited at the amazing sight, I guess), which caught us completely unprepared for detailed and objective observing.

We estimated that the object required from 2 to 20 seconds to pass across the sky. Counting back the minutes after it disappeared (and after we recovered our composure) we estimate that it was visible to us during part of the minute from 2302 and 2303 EST.

I am a retired Air Force officer, following 14 years of service which ended in October 1955, and I know 1) that this was no aircraft. Its had no pulling lights, no aircraft always show over inhabited areas and near airports. There was no green light as it came toward us and no red light as it moved away. It was a steady, unchanging orange light that never varied throughout its entire trajectory. We debated whether it could have been a light on the belly of a fast-moving jet, but it seems impossible that such a light could have been visible when the object was low on the horizon when it rose, and again when it was low on the horizon when it set.

I feel equally sure 1) was 2) no meteor, for it was visible for nearly half a minute, left no "trail", and had a trajectory so flat as to have ruled it out as a meteor or a "fireball". I have over seen such about spacecraft paths (I have made a hobby of astronomy for years and am a past member of the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York).

We also know 3) that it was neither Venus nor Jupiter. Jupiter for we both noted its position relative to these two planets during the "event" period of its transit.

We are deeply interested in this matter and would appreciate hearing anything you could inform us about it, also whether you have had any other reports about it. Whether one of us is likely to "feel" off our feet by a sighting like this, but we definitely feel we have seen something very real—and very unusual.

Sincerely yours,
