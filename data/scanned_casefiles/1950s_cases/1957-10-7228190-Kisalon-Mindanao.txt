The chart includes latitude and longitude grid lines, as well as various geographical features such as islands, bays, and other landmarks. The most prominent feature is the large "XK" markings in the center of the chart.

At 5:00 a.m. on 7 October, S.J. was standing in front of his church at Kisalon, Mindanao and saw a light approach from the Southeast. As the object moved closer, it became torpedo-shaped with four trails of flame. It separated into two parts and disappeared. Several people saw the object, and the people of a village on a ridge along which the object had passed were awakened by some unknown noises.

This sighting was recommended for an area of 30 miles around the point of observation. Low clouds and severe turbulence prevented adequate observation of the area in question. This area is extremely rough and peopled by unfriendly tribes. Philippine agencies were contacted and they promised to send in teams to question local people and search for debris.

(S) INFORMATION CONCERNING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN MINDANAO

This report transmits an account concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object over Kisalon, Mindanao on 23 October 1957 and subsequent investigation of the sighting to date.

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DAMA-Manilla, Philippines	15-55-53  

1. On February 1957 at 0500 hours, a strange light in the sky over Kisalon, Mindanao (050Â° - 3.5 miles) was standing in front of his church when he saw an unidentified luminous object approaching. As it came nearer it stopped and hovered over the church, emitting a beam of light towards the ground. The object then moved off and disappeared behind some trees. Mr. Crispin Jaro, an instructor in radio and TV mechanics, witnessed the phenomena and reported it to the authorities.

2. On 10 February the area in question and father of the witness were visited by personnel of the Air Attache office. They gave to the witness father the same information as communicated to us. In addition, he stated that the object appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter, was silvery in color and made no sound. The light beam emitted from the object was directed toward a point on the ground, approximately 300 feet from the witness. The witness stated that he watched the object for about 5 minutes and that the movements were erratic, sometimes hovering and at other times darting rapidly from one position to another. At one time the object disappeared completely and then reappeared in another position. The witness also stated that the object was observed by several other persons in the area and that the local authorities have promised to send a detail to investigate the area and interview those who saw the object.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: 
3. If the positions given by Father Peruzzi are reasonably accurate, it is possible that the object could have been some type of aircraft. The descriptions, however, do not conform to any known aircraft. It is possible that the object was some type of instrument which was being operated in the area as part of a special project. The descriptions of the lights, beam and disappearance and reappearance do not conform to the normal flight characteristics of an aircraft. They have promised to send a detail to investigate the area and interview those who saw the object.

As 5:00 P.M. on October 7, 1957, Father Llorente was standing in front of his church at Kisalon, Mindanao and saw a light approach from the southeast. When the object moved closer, it became torpedo shaped with four trails of flame. It separated into two parts and disappeared. Several people saw the object, and the people of a village on a ridge along which the object had passed were awakened by some unknown noise.

An aerial reconnaissance of an area of 30 miles around the point of observation was attempted. Low clouds and severe turbulence prevented adequate observation of the area in question. This area is extremely rough and densely forested. Preliminary investigation were conducted and they promised to send in teams to question local people and search for debris.

Father Llorente is a former chemistry and math instructor at Fordham University. Because of the assumed high degree of reliability or interest, this case is carried in the category of "unknown" pending further information.
