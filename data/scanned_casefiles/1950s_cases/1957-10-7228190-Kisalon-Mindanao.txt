At 5:00 A.M., S.J. was standing in front of his church at Kisalon, Mindanao and saw a light approach from the Southeast. When the object moved closer it became torpedo shaped with four trails of flame. It separated into two parts and disappeared. Several people saw the object, and the people of a village on a ridge along which the object had passed were awakened by some unknown noise.

An aerial reconnaissance of an area of 30 miles around the point of observation was attempted. Low clouds and severe turbulence prevented adequate observation of the area in question. This area is extremely rough and peopled by unfriendly tribes. Philippine agencies were contacted and they promised to send in teams to question local people and search for debris.

Father [redacted] is a former chemistry and math instructor at Fordham University. Because of the assumed high degree of reliability of sources, this is carried in the category of unknown pending further information.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

9Kira, Manila, Philippines                JR-50-53                PAGE    2    OF    2    PAGES

1. On 28 October 1957 at 0500 hours, local, [rest of first paragraph is partially illegible]

2. On 19 February in the area in question and Father [name redacted] were visited by personnel from this office. In conversation, Father [name redacted] gave the same information to Air Attaché personnel as communicated to Father [name redacted] in addition, he stated that the object appeared to be traveling about 4000 feet above the ridge line that he used as a point of reference and that it appeared to be some 5-6 miles a craft craft flying in the same position. A sketch showing the various positions is attached.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

3. If one assumes that the positions given by Father [name redacted] are reasonably accurate and that the Jarro Lieutenant did hear an explosion, it is possible that debris from the explosion could have fallen within the area sounded by a 30 mile arc from the point of observation. With this in mind, an aerial reconnaissance of the area was attempted. However, low clouds and severe turbulence precluded adequate inspection of the area. The particular area in question is extremely rough and according to Father Nisakar, is peopled by unfriendly tribes. Upon return to Manila the aid of the Philippine Air Force and Philippine Constabulary was enlisted. They have promised to send teams into the area to search for debris and to question the locals with regard to additional substantiating details.

why are these 5 sightings unconfirmed?

1. Kisalon, Philippines 18 Oct 57 5 AM
Would have been classified under
Incoming late information that the sources
not been considered so highly reliable.
Description did not fit the requirements
for an aircraft, meteor, or other known
object. - Dark blue green maneut -

Most likely would be an airplane
except for lack of sound
but: an aircraft missing
: no more information
: further investigation quite to area
being, apparently territorial
: people in village were awakened
by "noise"? but did not see

Here what missing item.
Time is collecting late <signing
noise>

Meaningful area information
should continue searching
that insufficient known.
