No--he said it was a yellow and shaped like a cigar and zoomed, but this thing was there. It didn't move and it wasn't shaped like a cigar. It was fat and shaped like a ball or an egg and it was this orangish reddish color.

It didn't give off a bunch of light. I mean it was light and it was shining but it wasn't shining on the ground or anything. It wasn't like a spotlight. It was just like a light bulb looks except with the glow got off that shines around it.

It was just like looking at a light bulb, painted orange or course. That is not shining out. You could see it, it was light. I mean you couldn't look in the sky and miss it even if it was far away. It was bright enough that I could see it. It was like a star. A star is bright but it doesn't make the sky light. The sky around it is dark.

No, it wasn't cloudy. There was just a cloud in the sky and the moon was behind the cloud. I know it was behind the cloud because the cloud looked silver lined. I looked up and that thing was there, and it certainly wasn't the moon because it was right there in my back yard. The moon would be in front of me as I looked out. It would be right over there, because after it is gone, then the moon comes out. And I stood there and watched the moon come out after I ran to the front door and moon came out. But it wasn't the moon.

I looked up and it was there. I didn't see it come; I didn't see it. I just looked up and it caught my eye and it was there. I started hollering for Mother and I watched it and it didn't even move while I was there. It didn't make any sound. It didn't do anything but just sort of sit there. There wasn't on the ground, it was just sitting in mid-air. I heard Mother come, I just ran and when I came back it wasn't there. I was gone for maybe 9-10 seconds.

It was more round long but wasn't round. It was that color and it was there. It didn't do anything, it didn't move, it didn't make any sound. It didn't--no antennas, doors, nothing. Didn't land, didn't take off. It was just all light, like if you painted a spotlight was shiny. Looked like polished metal in a spotlight but not like metal. It was a reddish color, sort of glowed but it didn't glow. It was just real bright. I mean a sort of colorful against the sky. It was about that bright but sort of an orange (Investigator is obviously displaying something).

our message CG 461L. No attempt was made to obtain a formal report
in this recording. After to "wording this st truth, the recording
officer asked several questions pertaining to the location and description of the object. The object being sighted, but not limiting up the surrounding area, the recording officer did not feel that a sworn statement, since the description of the sighting was similar to the description reported by our message 461L.

2. After reviewing the conditions under which the recording
was made:

    a. Position: Firing room of observer's home.

    b. Persons present during the recording: [redacted]

two hours after sighting of the object.

Mrs. [redacted] and sound of road story with organ.

3. On 5 November 1957, the recording officer visited the location in which the sighting of the object was reported. Examination
of the area revealed no significant or major factors or obstacles preventing a first-hand report. During the visit, the recording officer placed himself in the position of the observer at
the time of the reported sighting. It was the local time of approximately 20° above the horizon and 45° to the right of the line
of sight before the observer and the reported position of the object.

Starting at the moon will immediately look at the reported position
of the object, the reported officer has able to produce visual evi-
dence of a brilliant, oval, and object hovering in the area. Because
the ground covering was known to the time this sighting is not
present at the time of the observation made by the reported officer
this may or may not have caused the phenomenon reported.

Reference our message CY 1954 and CY 1955, the time of sighting is 18 October, message should be advanced twelve hours to correspond to full time.

Review and Brief - Tape Recording of UFO Sighting - Boerne, Texas, 7 November 1957

1. Recording was somewhat incoherent, with considerable background noise. Interviewer apparently had no knowledge of interview techniques (not a single direction, estimate, or bearing of the object given.).

2. The following equipment points were established from observers testimony:
    a. Object was round or slightly ovoid.
    b. Appeared to be about 200 feet away.
    c. Size given - about the size of a bus room (10-12 ft.). Seemed to hang over tree-top level.
    d. It remained stationary - until the returned outside after going inside bar.
    e. Somewhat contradictory point that it did not seem to move.

3. Notes:
    a. Appeared yellowish-orange
    b. Note: She alleged that the moon was to the right of the object
    c. The time is given by source, appears to have been 6:00 P.M. local time, i.e., 1800 hours (1800 + 6 = 2400Z)

3. a. Check with San Antonio area disclosed balloon released just before her general time of sighting.
    b. Balloon drifts - yellow-tan later
    c. Full moon that night - and was just to the right of object
    d. Hundreds of similar reports have shown that when any arc of sun or other light source reflect off spherical sources - against a dark background - it often gives the object as appearing slightly oval or elongated. This would be emphasized by a yellow or tan coloring.

4. Conclusions:
The object was without doubt the balloon that was released nearby (and is often the case) hovered over the source's area either because of a light leak or became or static conditions.

UFO SIGHTING, BOERNE, TEXAS
6 November 1957
06/2400Z

I looked down the street in the dawn (lawn?) and I saw something that caught my eye. I looked up and it was in between the chicken house and the tree in the pasture. It wasn't very high up in the air and it was a sort of yellowish, reddish color and it was shining but not like a searchlight(or the chicken house light). I was just looking at it, if I didn't move or anything. When I looked up it was there and it didn't move after it was there. It was just like a helicopter, just sitting there, and I was hollering formMother and everything. She was in the living room. Then I got scared cause I was yelling so loud. I figured she'd think that one of the kids was hurt or something eventhough the kids were with her; and so, I told her it wasn't important and I told her to hurry and come here.

And finally, I heard her coming and the kids were coming with her and I made a whole lot of noise. So I ran to the kitchen to tell her to hurry and when we got back out, it wasn't there. It didn't make any sound and I didn't zoom off or anything. It was just there and then it wasn't and we thought it was around 6:00. It was after dark. I don't know, that is all there was to it.

Oh, it was shaped like an egg or something like that--a foot-ball. I was shaped like a cigar. It was shaped either like an egg or a football. It wasn't round and it wasn't long either. The object was about 200 feet away, no it wasn't even that--I don't know what distance it was. It was about as far from where I am sitting here in the living room to Mrs. Jamison's house--the corner of her house.

The height (I didn't have to look up) was the level of the trees but when it was there the tree was over it so it was pretty close to the ground.

I thought maybe it was the thing that was going to shoot the dog out.

It was yellow, no, it wasn't yellowish--it was sort of an orangeish, reddish color like my halloween skirt. I mean, just like my skirt, that looks like a halloween skirt.

It was bigger than this room or about as big as this room. It was a little bit bigger. I think. I didn't really look at it. It was just there, it wasn't supposed to be and I thought it was going to shoot out.

It wasn't even five minutes. I looked up and it was there. I started hollering for Mother and so it was there about a minute. I mean at that time there and I could see it. There weren't any doors or anything. After I yelled, I got to thinking maybe it was going to shoot the dog out or I started looking to see if there were any doors to spring open or anything. So, there weren't any doors or windows. It was just a plain ordinary object.
