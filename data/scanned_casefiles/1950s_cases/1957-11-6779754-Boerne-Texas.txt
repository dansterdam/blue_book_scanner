Text from the document:

No-- he said it was a yellow and shaped like a cigar and sooner or later this thing went right but it wasn't shaped like a cigar, it was round and shaped like a ball or an egg and was this bright orange color. I meant it was light and it was shining but it wasn't shining on the ground or anything shiny like the spotlights, it was just like a light bulb in the sky. You could see it was several miles away. It was just like looking at a light bulb, a sort of yellowish white light. You could see it was far away. It wasn't very close and i don't think it was very high up in the sky around it is bright but it doesn't make the sky light. The sky around it is bright but it doesn't make the sky light. The moon was behind the clouds, I know, and the moon was behind the clouds. This thing didn't make any noise, I didn't hear any noise at all. It was just sitting there. The moon would be in front of me and even if it was behind my back it would be there because the moon would be up there. I didn't see the moon at all. After it was gone, then the moon came out and went down there and stood there and went down. I didn't see it come; I looked up and it wasn't there, I didn't see it come. It just appeared there and it disappeared just as quick. I didn't even notice any movement while it was there. I didn't see any sound. Didn't move while it was there. It just ran and when it came back it wasn't there. I was looking out there but it wasn't round. It didn't do anything, it didn't move, it just stayed there. It was the same color and it was there. It didn't do anything, it didn't move. It was just a light, like if you painted a spotlight on the wall. I looked like a polished metal is spotlighted. I mean it was color and it was there. It didn't do anything, it didn't move, except it was shiny. I looked like a polished metal is spotlighted. I mean it was color and it was there.

Review and Brief - Tape Recording of UFO Sighting - Boerne, Texas, 7 November 1957

1. Recording was apparently made last with considerable background noise (see 2 below). Questionable as to if any clarification of described object was given.

2. The following equipment points were established from observers:
a. Object was round or slightly ovoid.
b. Size given as about 200 feet away. 
c. Size given as about the size of this room (10-12 ft.). Seemed to hang over either side of horizon.
3. Witnesses emphatically stated that the object did not appear to be a balloon releasing gas.
4. Witnesses claim that the moon was to the right of the object thereby substantiating its position was about 0600 T. 
5. Check with Sea Antonic Area Control gave no report of any other light or object visible. This would be emphasized by a yellow or tan coloring.
Conclusion:
The object was without doubt the balloon that was released nearby (and is often the case) because of a slow leak or because of static conditions.

UFO SIGHTING, BOERNE, TEXAS
6 NOV 1957

I looked down the street in the dawn (lawn?) and I saw something that caught my eyes. I looked up and it was in between the chicken house and the tree in the picture. It wasn't very high, just up in the sky. It was sort of just hanging there like a balloon, only it wasn't moving at all. It was just light itself and it didn't move or anything. Then I ran in and I was hollering for Mother and everything. She was in the kitchen. Then I told her what I saw and I said "what is that?" Then she said she didn't know, but the kids were with her, and so I told her it wasn't nothing to be afraid of, but the kids were coming in with her, and she made a whole lot of noise. I took an old tin can and went to the kitchen to tell her, but she told me to go back and look again and it wasn't there.
Oh, it was shaped like an egg or something like that - I know that for sure. The object was about 200 feet away and it wasn't moving, that's all I can tell you about it. I don't know what it was.
I don't think it was anything to the house where I was living room to Mrs. Jamison's. The house hadn't moved and there the tree was. The tree was over it so it was pretty close to the house, I guess. That's the thing that was going in and out the dog out was yellow, no. It wasn't a yellowish - it was sort of an orange red color, something like my shirt. I mean, see like a Halloween skirt.
It was just there. The dog didn't bark or anything. It just in the room. I was just there and I thought it was supposed to be and I thought it was just a short thing. I started hollering for Mother and so it was there for about a minute and then it disappeared and I still didn't know what it was.
