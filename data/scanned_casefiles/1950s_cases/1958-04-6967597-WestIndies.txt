Other Flaming UFOs

Not all spectacular UFOs are meteors, of course, any more than they are all planets or balloons or rockets. Sudden brilliant illuminations of the night sky can have any one of a dozen or more explanations. The atmosphere is crowded with potential Unknowns, more than at any time in man's history. The air surrounding our planet plays host not only to meteors and fireballs, birds and insects, but also to military and commercial planes, private planes, jets, helicopters, weather balloons, experimental rockets, and an ever-growing number of artificial satellites. An ear-shattering detonation that rattles a house or breaks a window may come from exploding fireball or it may come from a jet penetrating the sound barrier. Without an exact knowledge of all the circumstances, only the foolhardy would attempt to say positively what caused any given unusual aerial phenomenon.

Let us consider a sighting that might have received various wrong interpretations and would probably have become one of the most famous of the UFOs cited by sundrom, had investigators lacked one essential fact.

Shortly after midnight one spring morning reliable witnesses on the east coast, particularly in Connecticut and Long Island, reported a brilliant bluish-white object flying at high altitude and incredible speed. As it flashed overhead, it changed color to become reddish, and several smaller objects apparently detached themselves from the main body and followed it in orderly fashion. About five minutes later more than fifteen ships in the Caribbean area observed similar objects sourcing overhead but the reports varied in many detail.

Ship number two saw brilliant short flames darting about behind the main body, which had a long, tapered tail. Ship number four saw a flaming white object more brilliant than the full moon. Ship number seven reported a flaming green ball followed by a group of several small objects. Ship number nine observed at least fifteen smaller objects that suddenly separated from the main body and fell into formation behind it. Ship number eleven saw an object with a trail several miles long, brilliant as a peacock's tail, so luminous that the deck and sea around were bathed in pale light as the body appeared to have a blue-white head, then a short dark space before the glowing orange-yellow tail. Twenty-seven separate particles were actually counted as they appeared in the main plume. Each followed the main body and each developed its own glowing tail on leaving it. The main body was several times brighter than Venus, while the offshoots were each twice the magnitude of Sirius.

While the lower half, which was emitting sparks, seemed to be flattened and reddish in color.

During this period of less than five minutes, similar objects were observed from the ground by witnesses in the Virgin Islands. One man in Martinique saw a luminous green globe, brighter than Venus. Followed at a slight distance by a flaming red, enormous long, cigar-shaped object. Observers in Barbados saw two huge objects, some twelve to eighteen "offspring" shaped like the main body, some of the offspring subdivided to form two small constable objects. The object disappeared into a cloud bank and vanished. No observations were reported from areas further south.

What was it?

In a single period of about ten minutes spectacular unidentified flying objects were reported over an area stretching from Connecticut to the coast of British Guiana, a distance of some 2,700 miles. All of the objects were themselves, they were remarkably brilliant. They seemed to have one or more leaders, to discharge smaller objects, and to fly in formation. They maintained a substantially horizontal path, and only the last observers, who saw the things disappear in the cloud bank, noted any tendency to descend. No fragments were ever found, and all observers were describing the same single phenomenon. If all the observers were describing the same single phenomenon, it was flying at the incredible speed of more than 16,000 miles an hour.

With only this fact to build on, an investigator might interpret the sightings according to his own prejudices: an invasion fleet of ships discharging the smaller craft at intervals; a mass hallucination; a peculiar meteorologic display; a single spacecraft darting over the earth with incredible speed.

while the lower half, which was emitting sparks, seemed to be flattened and reddish in color.
During this period of less than five minutes, similar objects were observed from the ground by witnesses in the Virgin Islands. One man in Martinique saw a luminous green globe, brighter than Venus, followed at a slight distance by a flaming red, enormously long, clear-shaped object. Observers in Barbados saw two huge objects clear-shaped objects, some of the offspring subdivided to form two small constellar objects. The object disappeared into a cloud bank and vanished. No observations were reported from areas farther south.

What was it?
In a single period of about ten minutes spectacular luminous unidentified flying objects were reported over an area stretching from Connecticut to the coast of British Guiana, a distance of some 2700 miles. They flew in a straight course. All of the objects were noiseless. They were remarkably brilliant. They seemed to have one or more leaders, to discharge smaller objects, and to fly in formation. They maintained a substantially horizontal path, and only the last observers, who saw the things disappear into the cloud bank, noted any tendency to descend. No fragments were ever found, and all witnesses agreed that the objects were not meteors. If all the observers were describing the same single phenomenon, it was flying at the incredible speed of more than 16,000 miles an hour.

With only these facts to build on, an investigator might interpret the sightings according to his own prejudices: an invasion fleet from another planet, making a reconnaissance in force, the mother ships discharging the smaller craft at intervals, a mass hallucination; a peculiar meteoric display; a single spacecraft daring over the earth with incredible speed.

Without knowledge of one essential fact, some hundreds of landsmen and seamen in the United States, the Caribbean islands, and the British West Indies might now feel fairly convinced that they had witnessed a genuine "Unknown." The date was April 14, 1958.

The privileged observers had witnessed the death of Sputnik II, the Russian satellite launched on November 3, 1957.

The UFO reports inspired by this event presented no problem to the Air Force. All information on the re-entry of artificial satellites is immediately accessible to ATIC. Whenever a report shows any possible resemblance to a falling satellite, Air Force investigators check at once with Spacetrack. Astronomers who had been tracking this satellite more than a month in advance that it would spiral toward the earth sometime between April 12 and April 15 had refined their estimate and predicted the actual event within a few hours [25].
