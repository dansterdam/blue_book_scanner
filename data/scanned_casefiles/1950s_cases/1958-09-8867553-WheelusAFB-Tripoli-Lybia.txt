ADE FROM THE ROOF OF A THREE-STORY BUILDING.

PAGE THREE RJTCAK 1:3A
AT FIRST HE THOUGHT THE LIGHT WAS ATTACHED TO A KITE BECAUSE HE HAS SEEN KITES WITH LIGHTS IN THE AREA BEFORE. HOWEVER, ALL KITE-LIGHTS BEFORE HAD FLINKED. WHEN THIS LIGHT CONTINUED TO MOVE ACROSS THE HORIZON, COVERING A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL MILES, HE DECIDED THAT IT COULD NOT BE A KITE. NO KNOWN HELICOPTERS, OTHER AIRCRAFT, CEILOMETERS, WEATHER BALLOONS, ETC. WERE IN THE AREA. GC1, THOUGH IN OPERATION, REPORTED NO UNUSUAL ACTIVITY. L. NONE.

CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF AIRCRAFT AND AIR ACTIVITIES. HE DENIED THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN ANY TYPE OF AIRCRAFT KNOWN TO HIM BECAUSE ITS SPEED VARIED SO GREATLY, IT HAD NO NAVIGATIONAL LIGHTS, AND IT MADE NO SOUND. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME HE HAS SEEN THIS OBJECT, THE OTHER TIME BEING ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO, HIS WIFE ALSO SAW THE OBJECT TWO WEEKS AGO. NO KNOWN HELICOPTERS, OTHER AIRCRAFT, CEILOMETERS, OR WEATHER BALLOONS WERE IN THE AREA. CGI, THOUGH IN OPERATION, HAD NO UNUSUAL OBSERVATION. A SIMILAR SIGHTING AT THE SAME TIME BY ANOTHER OBSERVER FROM ANOTHER LOCATION ABOUT FIVE MILES AWAY, IS BEING SUBMITTED IN A SEPARATE REPORT. L. NONE.

I apologize, but the image appears to be a scanned document with extremely small, blurry text that is largely illegible. While the document seems to be a structured form or table with multiple columns, I cannot confidently transcribe any specific text from this image. The resolution and quality make it impossible to perform accurate OCR at this time.
