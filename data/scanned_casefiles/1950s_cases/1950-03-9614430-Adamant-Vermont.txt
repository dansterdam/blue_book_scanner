A resident of Adamant, Vermont, reported that he sighted an unidentified flying object at 11:45E on 26 March 1950 over Adamant, Vermont, a post office in the township of Calais, approximately 7 miles north of Montpelier, Vermont. The object was crescent shaped and he estimated its size to be that of a DC-3 type aircraft. He said that the object was white, outlined in black and had a speed of about 300 miles per hour. At an altitude of 10,000 feet, it was headed northeast. No comments were offered in regard to the maneuverability, sound, or exhaust. No photographs or sketches of the configuration are available.

Mr. [redacted] stated that he has had approximately six years experience with aircraft, but he did not disclose the field of experience nor the capacity in which he gained his experience.

Comments of Olmsted Flight Service Center: Ramsdeller Field informed the Olmsted Flight Service Center that no modified aircraft was or flight from that field, nor were there any other unidentified aircraft in the vicinity at that time.
