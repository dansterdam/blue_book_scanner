CONCLUSION OF THE INTELLIGENCE ON SIGHTINGS
7 MI. NW OF OGALLALA IN SOUTHWEST 1/4 SEC 15 APPROPRIATE DISTANCE

MILE NORTHWEST OF WHERE THE REPORTED SIGHTING WERE MADE.

THEN POSSIBLE BUT ALSO PROBABLE POSSIBILITY IS AN OPTICAL
ILLUSION OR REFLECTION. MOST LOGICAL IS THE FACT THAT SIGHTING WAS AN
UNIDENTIFIED MOST LOGICAL IS THE FACT THAT SIGHTING WAS AN
NARCOIDES TO HAVE C-47 ACTIVITY AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING.

STATED WAS AT OGDEN, 17 MAR 59

TRAILS WERE RECORDED

COULD APPEAR TO A CASUAL OBSERVER AS UNIDENTIFIED SIGHTINGS.

NOT APPLICABLE

Psychological Aspects:
* This no doubt that
this man might have

Then time cleared, insmuch as
to travel with SAC clearance noted and

HEADING OF 180 DEGREES. ON THIRD SIGHTING OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY
AND FADED INTO ONCOMING DUSK.

FLIGHT PATH AND MANEUVERS ON FIRST SIGHTING WERE ACCELERATION
FROM STATIONARY POSITION IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION, VEERING TO SOUTHWEST
WHILE ACCELERATING. ON SECOND SIGHTING OBJECT APPEARED TO BE AT 45
DEGREE ANGLE TO HORIZON AND STATIONARY. THEN THE END NEAREST THE GROUND

[Most of the text is illegible or obscured by black redaction lines. The document appears to be a typewritten page with multiple lines of text mostly blocked out. There are vertical perforations on the right side of the page, suggesting it is from a bound document or file.]

The handwritten text at the top is partially legible, but I cannot confidently transcribe all of it due to the image quality.
