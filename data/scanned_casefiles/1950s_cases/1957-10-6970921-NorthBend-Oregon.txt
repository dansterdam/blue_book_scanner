Here is the OCR text from the document:

An analysis of the report, confirm your belief that it was observed in a real scientific technique. Your part of the object is merely to aid in making a correlation of data. Your notes give by a mile the most valuable information which is given here.

Concerning with such an object is an extremely rare occurrence. Based on indications that the majority of people who see such objects are either pilots, or scientifically trained observers, flying saucer sightings in that the witnesses are usually quite reliable. Continuing with the investigation, like a magnetic force drawing him a magnetic force drew him into the earth, then even more closely, he became aware that something was in the vicinity. For nearly 10 minutes he was able to observe, then even more closely, he became aware that something was in the vicinity. Practically without warning, a huge silvery object came into view. It is quite evident that a pilot with 16 years of experience is a highly reliable observer. A height above 50 miles, while in ordinary velocity would be a frequently passing use.

The document also contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a circular or sun-like object with radiating lines.

The page is marked with the number "10" in the top right corner.
