11. COMMENTS
The duration of the sighting, the lack of radar contact, the fact that the objects were reported in the west (the location of Venus) leads this hq above checked evaluation. It does not seem logical that one object was traveling very slow and the other "very fast" if they were seen for the periods indicated in 7 above.
