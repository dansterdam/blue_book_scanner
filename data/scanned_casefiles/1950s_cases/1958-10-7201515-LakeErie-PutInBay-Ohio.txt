The first time we sighted this light we left Put-in Bay to go to work at Middle Bass. I was if we were keeping a boat here but we three if was we kept a boat at Middle Bass. We were looking and found this all at Middle Bass. We saw we were about half way over. We saw this light at first it was so bright we saw this light at first it was faded away. We thought it a flash, when it faded away. But still came on again in a few seconds so as I looked at my watch as I would to jump its as we still thought its brightness it faded its away again after its bright mess. I saw how we got into the dock and told our boss about it. We naturally started to kick there, well they naturally started to hide us up. He. Ho. So all we were only hardly I could not get over it. This happened the first time about 3 weeks before Oct. 31st.

Oct. 31, 1958.

Dear Sir:

This morning at about 15 minutes to 7 my father and at least ten others saw a large light about the size of a basketball ball of some length over the lake about due north of Middle Bass Island, Ohio.

The light was about the brightness of an electric light bulb or a gasoline lantern. It appeared and disappeared twice, each time growing dim until it no longer could be seen, and reappearing in the same manner. All this time the light appeared to be motionless.

These men who are all commercial fishermen were in three separate boats, two being about a mile apart and the third about two and one half miles southeast of the other two. After the light faded out no object could be seen where the

912 was traveling in a boat at about 335 degrees, when I noticed this unusually bright light about the size of a basketball at about a mile and a half ahead of the boat. Immediately, I informed the other fellows of it. I stopped the boat and we all looked. By then it was very bright, but never moved. Then it disappeared completely. Then it came on again just as brightly for about 1 minute. We went on marking and disappeared completely. About a week later we saw it again in the same place with it doing the same thing. Just like the fish boats... [rest of text is partially cut off or illegible]

So that nite I came home and I told my eldest son who wrote you that letter what we seen. My son is a senior at B.C.S.U. and was always interested in playing Saucer "what he could Read". So on Fri. Oct. 31st in the morning we came to Middle Bass and got our crews in our boats we started out to left our nets. Just as we got ahead of Sugar Island the boss and myself and another crew member this light again appeared in the sky and I shouted to the other two "here is that light again". So he shut off the motor and we turned back side as we would not have any obstruction of the wind shield and it acted the same so the first time we seen it. Only this time I asked them if they thought they were drinking. Here 17a. I'm the meaning that were two

I told my son what we

he told me that they saw the
same lights as well before in

same time.

I talked with one of the men by phone tonight and he told one he had seen the same light a week ago today in the same place.

My father told me he saw it in the same place about 3 weeks ago.

At both these other times the light behaved in the same manner.

All of these men average about 20 to 25 years of experience on the lake, and are quite familiar with airplane sighting.

They said that it definitely wasn't an airplane or as they even stopped their boats to watch it to look for a plane. If you are still interested in these things it might be worth your while to check on it or it might reappear.

Yours truly,

P.S. For your own benefit that I'm "pulling your leg" I'm not jokingly from body being stuck with this, going with a big sign in sky.

Dear Mr.

We are in receipt of your letter dated 31 October 1958, in which you report an unidentified object sighted by your father, and others.

The information which you have submitted is very limited in nature, and insufficient upon which to base a firm conclusion.

Therefore, it would be appreciated if you would have your father and one man from each of the other boats fill in the attached questionnaires in as much detail as possible. Upon completion, please return the forms to this Center in the enclosed envelopes.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? It came or bought out watch moving where in a few seconds it readjusted itself again.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

All I can say is it came on as a bright light then faded away, then in a few seconds it readjusted itself again.
