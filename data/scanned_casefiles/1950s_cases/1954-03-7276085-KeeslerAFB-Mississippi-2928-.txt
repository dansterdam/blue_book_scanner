SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: KEESLER AIR FORCE BASE, MISSISSIPPI
DATE: 7 MARCH 1954

DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION:

On 7 March 1954, at approximately 2205 hours, an airman at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over the base.  The airman reported the sighting to the Commanding Officer of the 3906th Air Base Wing, who in turn notified this office.

This office initiated an immediate investigation.  The airman who observed the object was interviewed, and he provided the following information:

The airman stated that he was on duty in the area of the base theatre when he observed a bright, round object in the sky moving in a northeasterly direction.  He estimated the object to be approximately 500 feet in altitude and traveling at a speed of approximately 500 mph.  The object was visible for approximately 10-15 seconds before disappearing from view.

The airman further stated that the object did not make any sound and appeared to be self-luminous.  He also reported that the object changed direction abruptly during its flight.

This office has conducted a thorough investigation into this incident, including a search of the area for any physical evidence.  However, no physical evidence has been recovered, and there are no other witnesses to corroborate the airman's account.

This investigation is now closed, and the incident is classified as "Unidentified" in accordance with Air Force Regulation 200-2.
