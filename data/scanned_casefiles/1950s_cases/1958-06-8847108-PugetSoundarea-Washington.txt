GOGS6h. Al 32, 9pt AP3, Colorado DS-u-C-1
The following format was extracted from: REPORT NR 15, AFR 200-2-1
A. Description of Object:
(1) The object was cylindrical in shape with the diameter of about a little less than one half the length. The object appeared to be vibrating or shimmering, and seemed to be metallic in color although this may have been caused by the brighter color at those positions.
(2) The object was about the size of one thirty second (1/32") in diameter and one sixth (1/6") in depth.
(3) The object was whitish with a slight orange tint. t hese were some slight blinking lights. The orange tint appeared similar to a reflection of sunlight. The source and the center of the object were a deeper orange color.
(4) One.
(5) N/A.
(6) The only descriptive features were those described in (1), (2) and (3) above.
(7) None observed.
(8) No sound was heard.
(9) None.
B. Description of Course of Object:
(1) Visual sighting of object traveling at a high rate of speed.
(2) From the observation point at 40 b. the object was at 30 degrees elevation and heading in a northerly direction.
(3) From the observation point at 52 the object was at 60 degrees elevation and on a northerly course.
(4) Pilot was on a one hundred eighty degree (180°) heading when he first observed the object traversing from south to north at a very high rate of speed. As the pilot continued straight ahead the object climbed at a steeper angle heading towards the north. The pilot made a slight adjustment to the left to keep the object in sight but lost sight of the object during the maneuver. During the observation the object appeared to be a small point of light and was at a very high altitude. The pilot stated that he couldn't keep the object in sight as it appeared to be traveling too fast and had climbed too high to be under his observation for more than three minutes at the most.

The image appears to contain a handwritten document with a diagram or illustration. The diagram depicts some kind of balloon or flying object. The text below the diagram mentions "Secret Balloons Are" and "The Flying Saucers" with additional handwritten notes.

Text from the document:

Secret Balloons Are
The secrets could be seen through binoculars, or their contrails could be traced with radar, or they could be photographed. They were called radar balloons, and radar reflectors were used on them, but they were not ordinary weather balloons.
An Australian man had this method which involved prolonged gazing at the sky, as a result they 
found, the object or flying saucer they had seen was actually a balloon.
In New Mexico turned out to be a weather balloon. Another case in New York, was just a guided missile.

This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page provides a detailed description of an observed object, including its flight path, behavior, and other characteristics. It mentions that the observer "spotted this object" while flying at a certain altitude, and describes the object's rapid movements, changing attitudes, and eventual disappearance from sight.

Text from the document:

(5) a. Many reports of pilots trying to keep small, moving objects centered while they attempt to photograph them or file a which results with the illusion or appearance that the object was moving around the aircraft - instead of VIC versa. This invariably happens at close range when the object being observed has little altitude change show that pilot stating that the object (balloon?) was closing in on the aircraft, when actually the balloon was trailing still. This could possibly account for pilot's statement object circled around him. Correlation of this with his apparent, relatively indecent or unreliable observation - this honest mistake or belief on his part is understandable.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
(6) Check with AIRWAY (AMBER) NO. 8 - Running SE 2nd NW which carries considerable traffic. Although the pilots observed closely parallel this traffic airway heading - which would indicate the object was an aircraft - the characteristics, description, motion pattern rule out aircraft, but strongly point out balloons.

On the basis of data given, analysis of the pilots information and his personal reliability check, there is no compelling reason to conclude that the object observed was not probably a balloon.

Analyst's general comments:
Check: Same old story that pilots are "inreputable observers," although better than most, pilots still subject to all the opinions, mistakes, illusions all other observers are - - - to.

UPON REPORT # 9-5-58

DATE OF INCIDENT: 9 June 1958
LOCATION OF INCIDENT: NW1350 (Position appro, midway between Tacoma and Seattle), Washington
TIME: 1817Z (10:17 A.M. Local)

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT: Pilot of F-102 aircraft, while between 40,000 to 50,000 ft., whose diameter was approximately 1/2 times its depth (Comment: believe source meant length, Flight was 6,500 MPH) observed a miniature object, cylindrical in shape, whose diameter was approximately 1/12 times its depth (Comment: again, believe he observed object moving at a very high speed). Pilot observed object moving practically overhead, continued North, then it appeared to climb, slowdown, then do a left turn. Pilot states "object then circled me several times before he descended to lower levels."

It is significant to point out (as a routine "source reliability" check or clue) that the pilot gave figures of 7/12 (diameter) and 1/12 (diameter) for Minon's aircraft size, motion and maneuverability measurements which seem too precise (in view of the great speed) to be other than estimates based on precision rulers, calipers or instruments.

INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
(1) Wind picks for area show winds from SE to NW for 40,000 ft. (consistent with pilot's statement)
(2) With flight path of object at estimated 50,000 feet, estimated speed of 6,500 M.P.H. and above
(consistent with pilots statement) object made large turn at these estimated altitudes
(3) Balloon was released about 20 minutes before sighting, and officially reported to have reached 40,000 feet, U.S. A. F. wx srv. in that area
(4) Pilot states radar units, others in area did not see anything unusual. 
Pilot states he did not make any effort to check if object was on his radar.

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE

FINAL ATIC EVALUATION: PROBABLY BALLOON:
(1) Balloon released 20 minutes before sighting and up in that area.
(2) Up to est. 50,000 feet object on W-NW track. Wind was blowing in that direction. At est. 50,000 wind shifted, blowing from N-NW to N-NE (as bluebird surface balloon would)
(3) Pilot states object oscillated/slowed down/turned itself, these are well-known, proven balloon characteristics.
(4) A word on pilots probable reliability (reporting officer did not evaluate): note estimated measurements given in para. A.C did not report. Most observers from fixed positions on ground cannot estimate within one or two inches.
