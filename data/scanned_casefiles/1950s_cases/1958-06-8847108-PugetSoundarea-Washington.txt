The following format was extracted from AFPR 15, AFR 200-2:

A. Description of Object:
(1) The Object was cylindrical in shape with the diam r twelve (12) times two depth. The Object appeared to be all sil tly thicker in the center and around the ed;es, how-v r observed, thought this may have been caused by the darker color at these positions.

(2) Object was three fourths inches (3/4") in diameter and one six enth (1/16") to one thirty second (1/32") in depth.

(3) Object was whitish with a slight orange tint. Observe- thought that the orange tint appeared similar to a reflection of sunl- t. The edges and the center of the object were darker.

(4) One.

(5) N/A.

(6) The only discernible features were those described in (1), (2) and (3) above.

(7) None observed.

(8) No sound was heard.

(9) None.

B. Description of Course of Object:
(1) Visual sighting of object traveling at a high rate of speed.

(2) From the observation point at 40°: the object was at 30 degrees elevation and heading in a northern heading.

(3) From the observation point at 52°: the object was at 50 degree elevation and on a northeast heading.

(4) Pilot was on a one hundred eighty degree (180°) heading. He first observed object in: north at terrific speed, upon first sighting the object, observer used it to other aircraft, he over upon a closer observation he observed it to be about 1/16 object and a slight up and down oscillation (similar to aircraft wavering its wing).

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1006th AIS3, Ent AFB, Colorado                     D5-UFC-1                     4 of 4

(3) 1.
(4) Unlimited.

H. Sea weather released a ballon at 09/1958. The height of the ballon was
estimated at 40900 feet at the time of the sighting with a public action
over Lower Puget Sound.

I. The interceptor climbed at maximum power to 52 k, maintaining visual sighting
on the object.

J. At the time of the sighting was on an interceptor mission with another
F-102, which was on a southwest heading fifteen (15) to twenty (20) miles in
front of Lt. Sharf heading away from the object sighted. A third aircraft
was approximately forty (40) to fifty (50) miles southwest of sighting and
heading in a northerly direction. Both of these pilots were notified by Lt
Sharf of the sighting but neither pilot observed anything.

K. Lt Sharf has had four (4) years flying experience and is accustomed to
various types of reflections. It is his opinion that the object was of
definite composition and intelligently maneuvered.

I can add no additional information to validate or invalidate Lt Sharf's
observation.

The Portland GCA AD Filter Center had no UFO reports from seven (7) through
thirteen (13) June 1958. The 75th ADC Controller in three of Lt Sharf's
during his flight was util. sing 17F equipment for tracking, and 114 not
observe if any additional objects appeared on the radar scope. During his
visual contact with the object Lt Sharf did not observe it on his radar
scope.

Here is the text from the document:

Unmanned research balloons are upward, dancing 15 to 18 ft of weather instruments to be used in flying a battery of telemetering sets. Gas expels units might test a balloon's capabilities.

Secret Balloons Are

The saucers could be sun reflections on low clouds, or they could be distance hallucinations, drifting down toward the earth. Then the sun-split sky of Army weather radio mobile balloons, fitted with radar reflectors.

An Australian ten-line showed his students that with prolonged gazing you could see a point in front of the retina of the eye. As a result they "saw" objects in the sky.

(One sure-fire flying saucer that is a weather balloon. In New Mexico turned out to be just a weather balloon. Another, near New York, was just a balloon carrying cosmic ray equipment.)

the Flying Saucers

Not So! Balloons
only account for a few so-called Saucers, a/c, etc. 15, etc.

(5) Many reports of pilots trying to keep small, moving objects centered while they attempt to maneuver around on file - which results with the illusion or appearance that the object was moving around the aircraft - instead or vice versa. This invariably happens at very high altitudes where there is no horizon. During or perspective points. Many reports show that pilot stating that the object (balloon) was closing on the aircraft, when actually the balloon was standing still. This could possibly account for pilot's statement object circled around him. Correlating this with his apparent, somewhat doubtful reliability in judging or estimating size and distances (shown here) - this honest mistake or belief in his part is understandable.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:

(6) Check with U.S. Aero Chart #269, discloses that pilot was just South. of controlled AIRWAY (AMBER) No. 1 - Running SE and NW, which carries controllable TRAFFIC. Although the flight of the object pilot observed closely parallels this traffic survey heading - which would indicate the on point was an aircraft - the characteristics, description, flight pattern rule out aircraft, but strongly point out balloons.

On the basis of data given, analysis of the pilots information and his personal reliability check, there is no compelling reason to conclude that the object observed was not probably a balloon.

Analyst's personal comments:
Check: Same old story that pilots are "irreputable observers"; Although better than most, pilots still subject to all the opinions, mistakes, illusions all other observers are ____ to.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SUMMARY
SUMMARY AND EXTRACT REPORT

Analyst: George T. Gregory
Capt., USAF

UFOB REPORT # 9-J-58

DATE OF INCIDENT: 9 June 1958

LOCATION OF INCIDENT: NC-330 (Position approx. midway between Tacoma and Seattle, Washington)

TIME: 1817Z (1017 A.M. Local)

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT: Pilot of F-102 aircraft, while between 40,000 to 50,000 ft. alt, at Mach. 9 (600+ MPH) observed a pinkish-white object, cylindrical in shape, whose diameter was approximately 12 times its depth (Comment: believe Source meant length). Pilot was going South (180°), when he observed object moving due North which appeared to oscillate as it moved. Pilot made a left turn, continued North. Then it appeared to (Note:) climb, slowdown, then do a left turn. Pilot claims the object then circled his aircraft three times before he descended to lower levels.

It is significant to point out (as a routine "source reliability" check or clue), that pilot gave figures of 3/4 in. (diameter), 1/16 in. to 1/32 in. for depth in estimated. Almost incredible that measurements like this could be given while flying at 600 MPH. Hairbreadth measurements of this nature would require precision rulers, calipers or instruments.

INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
(1) Wind plots for area show winds from SE to NW for 40,000 ft. (consistent with flight path of object at estimated 40,000 feet).
(2) Wind plots for area show winds from West to NE from 50,000 ft alt and above (consistent with pilots statement object made large turn at these estimated altitudes).
(3) Balloon was released about 20 minutes before sighting, and officially reported to have reached at least 40,000 by U.S. N. Wx Svc. in that area.
(4) Other pilots, radar units, others in area did not see anything unusual. Pilot states he did not make an effort to check if object was on his radar scope (?)

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE

FINAL ATIC EVALUATION: PROBABLY BALLOON:
(1) Balloon released 20 minutes before sighting and up in that area.
(2) Up to est. 40,000 feet object on N-NW track. Wind was blowing in that direction. At est. 50,000 ft, slowing, blowing T-SW up to N-NE (as shown by official check). This would account for change of direction at that altitude (object therefore was moving with wind, generally).
(3) Pilot states object oscillated, slowed down, climbed, turned; these are well-known, proven balloon characteristics.
(4) A word on pilots probable reliability (reporting officer did not evaluate): note estimated measurements given in para. A.2 of report. Most observers from fixed positions on ground cannot estimate within one or two inches.

(REFERENCE TT MESSAGE 25TH CADD TAG F 34.) 1st LT CHARLES J.
SCHARF, 318TH FIS, MCCHORD AFB, WAS FLYING AT 40,000 FEET IN F-102
WHEN HE SIGHTED A ROUND WHITE OBJECT, WITH A DARK CIRCLE IN THE
CENTER, 30 DEGREES ELEVATION ABOVE HIS AIRCRAFT. IT WAS TRACKING
NORTH AND F-102 WAS ON A 180 DEGREE HEADING AT .9 MACH. OBJECT
WAS TRAVELING AT A TERRIFIC SPEED AND F-102 TURNED TO KEEP IT IN
SIGHT. IT APPEARED TO CLIMB AND SLOW DOWN, DO A LARGE 360 DEGREE
ORBIT, THEN DESCENDED AND STARTED CLOSING IN TOWARD THE F-102.
OBJECT THEN MADE 4 OR 5 SMALL ORBITS AROUND THE F-102. IT
FINALLY PITCHED UP 45 DEGREE ALTITUDE AND ACCELERATED IN A CLIMB,
RAPIDLY DISAPPEARED ON A NORTHWEST HEADING. A BALLOON WAS PROBABLY
