10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One round black-grey object, size of
a nickel at arm's length. Object was
spinning with edges blurred. Object
appeared to move sideways, and appear
wafer thin at 45dgr angle in erratic
movement. Object was seen at about 2 to
3 miles elevation on 904gr azimuth and
disappeared at 2 to 3 miles elevation at
45dgr azimuth. At first, object seemed
to rise slowly; then move right at a 45dgr
angle, and then to the left at a 45dgr
angle. Movement up & down was erratic.
Obj soon vanished for 40 to 50 seconds.
