Doe and Mrs. Doe were driving in a 1954 Chevrolet along a country road west of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. They noticed an unusual object in the sky which they watched for approximately 30 minutes. The object was described as being round or oval in shape, emitting a bright bluish-white light and seemed to be hovering or slowly moving in a southerly direction. The object was illuminated with lights and appeared to be individual or separate parts. It seemed to change course at times and occasionally to start, stop or change shape. However, it did change size from point of observation. SOURCES could not identify or describe the types of lights or flash indications of the object. They stated the object was solid. There was no audible sound during the sighting. SUBJECT stated that after observing the object for some time, it appeared to be the size of a nickel held at arm's length when seen against the sky. He estimated its size to be approximately 300 degrees from true north and approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. SUBJECT stated that the object was occasionally obscured by high-tension power lines. The color of the object, according to SUBJECT, seemed to be a bright bluish-white. The object appeared to move in a somewhat erratic manner similar to a bowl. SUBJECT reported that he was looking northwest through the windshield of the car. The object seemed to move in and out of the field of vision at times. The object was in sight for approximately 30 minutes before it disappeared, fading off gradually.
SOURCES, Part One, is of the opinion that the object was an air-craft of some kind, but could not identify it or describe it in detail.

PART FIVE of
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
In the opinion of the preparing officer the sighting was probably an
optical illusion. The celestial body that could have been mistaken for an unidentified flying object was Jupiter. The movement and apparent variation in brightness were within normal variations for this planet. The irregularity of the motion is probably due to atmospheric conditions affecting the image. The pattern of travel and the lack of acceleration, deceleration, or abrupt changes in direction is characteristic of Jupiter. Speeds will move approximately 100 per hour, according to the description furnished.
Moon   145 31' in one hour
Jupiter   150 23' in one hour
Venus    130 in one hour
Mars    150 in one hour
PERIOD: Weather balloons were not present in the area during the sighting. The conditions of light were such that they might possibly create a reflection of light on a balloon with the resultant appearance resembling that of a solid object. However, no balloon was reported.
INVESTIGATION: Research of possible aircraft in the area at the time of sighting resulted in no identification of the object. The movement, moreover, of the object as described precludes the possibility of normal aircraft movement in this area and the unidentified object.
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT AS DESCRIBED BY SOURCES PRECLUDES THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS SIGHTING WAS OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
These characteristics of the object as reported by these sources are essentially within the capabilities of the celestial bodies mentioned, and the meteorological conditions prevailing during the sighting, such as the temperature inversions, may have been contributing factors to the occurrence of this sighting.

OBSERVATION & EVALUATION BY: CAPT CHESTER HOWARD, 745th AGW SQUADRON, DUNCANVILLE, TEXAS
INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM: DIRECTOR, AIR FORCE BASE CONTROL TOWER
SUMMARY:
At exactly 23302, 12 MAY 1956, Ferrin Tower relayed information to this station that a 'GCA' sighting was reported by the local "F" MARSHALL of Healdton, Oklahoma, and another man who called to report that an object was seen hovering over Healdton, Oklahoma. Ferrin Tower advised that we scramble fighters (F-86D's) to have a look at this unknown track.
At exactly 23302, 12 MAY 1956, Ferrin Tower relayed more information to this station. The Director of Base Operations advised the F-86D's were then in the air. This object was described as round, fiery orange in color, was seen to be hovering over Healdton, and disappearing to the north west. Pilots stated they were unable to locate the object. Weather at time of sighting was estimated at 2300 overcast, visibility 10 miles. Air traffic in the vicinity at the time was light to moderate.
Advise that a direct report be obtained from the personnel that were on duty at Ardmore Air Force Base concerning this sighting, since the no-named communicated individual on this station was not present during the actual sighting.
During the time of the sighting the C-15 Fairchild scope camera was in operation and approximately 25 ft. of birdgull film was exposed, although no UFO's were observed on this station. Weapon the film is being forwarded for evaluation. CONAD Form 6 is also being forwarded.

Education: B.S. Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Qualifications: SOURCE has been on active duty for approximately 5 years, primarily working in engineering schools.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appears to be highly intelligent and completely sincere. All questions were answered frankly and in those instances where uncertain, source could not give definitive answers. There was no hesitation between question and answer, but the investigation and expressed the opinion that the incident did not appear to indicate foreign attitudes on the part of the sighting. SOURCE was unable to make estimates of velocities or distances during the sighting.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 6 May 1956 between the hours of 1915 and 2015, he observed an object while driving in his automobile eastbound on NW 23d Street in Oklahoma City, Okla. The object first came into view in the southwest and traveled in a northeasterly direction. SOURCE indicated the object appeared to be round or elliptical in shape, giving off a bluish-white glow, and giving the impression of a solid, metallic appearance. The object moved without any visible means of propulsion, making no sound, and appeared to change directions abruptly, with a minimum of turning radius or deceleration. The object was sighted for approximately 5-7 minutes and finally disappeared from view to the northeast. SOURCE stated that the object did not appear to be larger than the average automobile headlight and was brighter than any natural celestial body or other object he had ever seen. The size of the object was comparable to that of an automobile headlight approximately 1/2 to 3/4 mile distant. During the period of sighting, the object did not appear to increase or decrease in size or brightness. SOURCE stated that he was unable to estimate the real size or distance of the object in its longest dimensions, but source did state that the object was a physical object and was not a reflection or a plastic-like substance. SOURCE indicated he first observed the object to the southwest and it appeared to be stationary. He travelled in a northerly direction at approximately 35 MPH for 5-7 minutes, during which time the object remained in approximately the same position in relation to his automobile. He concluded his observation when the object disappeared from view to the northeast.

The object appeared to be oval in shape, dark in color, and traveling rapidly, with a speed estimated to be around 1,000 miles per hour. Its altitude was estimated to be about 12,000 feet.  The object appeared to be about the size of a "7.63 caliber bullet" and was similar to an auto headlight. 3 blocks away. Object moved in a westerly direction and disappeared as it seemed to wink out or go into a dive. SOURCE did not observe any exterior lights or flame and did not hear any sound. He stated the object appeared to be solid and metallic in appearance, and disappeared from view instantly, as if it turned off a switch. SOURCE stated he has never seen anything like this before, and was completely mystified by the object.

SOURCE reported the object was sharply outlined, shaped like a cigar, with a yellowish-red glow to it which would pulsate and fade, then reappear. The object would sometimes appear to hover in one spot, and at other times it would streak across the sky in a small portion of the time it appeared to hover. The motions of the sighting object appeared to SOURCE to be erratic and unnatural to the point of being speedy at one point in direction and slowly passed out of sight over the western horizon.
SOURCE stated the object did not break into pieces nor did it appear to emit any sparks or flames. The object did not make any audible sound. It was stated by SOURCE that the object approached to within approximately 35 miles of his position and then slowly passed out of sight. The observation lasted for approximately 10-15 minutes. 
Weather: Warm temperature and no wind during the period of sighting. NOT VER

Transcribed text from the document:

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the sighting was probably an optical phenomenon for the following reasons:
1. The object was not visible in that portion of the sky where the sighting occurred. This may have been due to atmospheric conditions, and it is possible that the object or objects remained in that area but were not observed through the sky.
2. The movement of the object as described by the witnesses, in an arc from point to ultimate disappearance, indicates that the area traveled by the witnesses would include any apparent variation of the object's position.
3. The moon will move approximately 15° per hour, according to description furnished by witnesses, Object's movement in the 52 minutes it was visible was approximately 15°.

Moon:
Azimuth: 148.31 in one hour
Azimuth: 152.23 in one hour
Jupiter: 159
Venus: 159
Saturn: 159

Period: No weather balloons were present in the area during the sighting, but meteors or other unidentified objects of light were apparent, and it is possible that these might possibly create a reflection or light on a balloon with the resultant characteristics as described. According to the sources, it would appear that the sighting was possibly a meteor or other similar natural phenomena.

Negative of Research of possible aircraft in the area of sighting resulted in no indications that the object sighted was other than some natural phenomena. Tanker AR6 near the movement, however, of the object, as described, SOURCES indicate not a sighting or any tactical or strategic aircraft could be identified as connected with the sighting of the unidentified object.

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION: The characteristics of the object as described by SOURCES precludes the possibility that this sighting was a meteor. Combinations of the object as reported by these SOURCES, however, suggest that the sighting may have been caused by meteorological conditions prevailing during the sighting, such as temperature inversions, may have been contributing factors to the occurrence of this sighting.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was at his home when his attention was attracted by a bright light hovering about 200 feet above the ground, approximately 150 to 200 yards from his house. This light was observed for about 3 to 5 minutes. The section of sky involved was overhead with no noticeable cloud cover. The object appeared to pulse or throb when standing still, but did not change shape, or give any indication of rotation, ascent or descent, or lateral movement. The object did not move in front of or behind any trees or buildings. After the 3 to 5 minute observation, the object appeared to accelerate rapidly and disappeared over the horizon. SOURCE described the object as a bright, pulsating light with no visible outline or definite shape. He stated that it did not move in front of or behind anything, and appeared to disappear over the horizon. SOURCE was unable to estimate the size of the object, but stated that it was much brighter than any star or planet, and appeared to be about 200 feet above the ground.
