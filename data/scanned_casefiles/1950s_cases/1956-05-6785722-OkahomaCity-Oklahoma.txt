II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appeared to be of average intelligence. Answers to questions were given in a forthright manner with no attempts to procrastinate. SOURCE was very cooperative throughout the investigation and appeared sincerely anxious to help find a solution for the sightings.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 6 May 1956 at approximately 2205 CST while checking the sky for weather conditions he noted a bright object in the western sky below the clouds. SOURCE'S attention was attracted to the object because of its exceptional brightness. SOURCE stated he viewed the object for approximately 50 minutes using 6X30 power binoculars. SOURCE reported the object was sharply outlined, shaped like a bowl, and rimmed with lights. Lights appeared to be individual but were two numerous to count. (Incl Pix Sketch of object). For the first 30 minutes of the sighting object appeared to hover in a small portion of sky and appeared to move in a somewhat erratic manner similar to an aircraft in rough air. After about 30 minutes object appeared to be moving in a westerly direction and slowly passed out of sight over the western horizon. SOURCE indicated he saw a few stars but no moonlight was apparent. Object appeared brighter than the background of the sky and was comparable to the brightness of an automobile headlight a city block away. Object did not break into parts, give off smoke or change shape. However, it did change brightness from time to time and seemed to pulsate or throb. SOURCE stated he noted an aircraft at any time during the sighting. SOURCE said he thought the object was solid. There was no audible sound during the sighting. SOURCE was saw only one object and estimated that the real size of the object at its longest dimension was approximately 100 feet. SOURCE was certain object appeared to be the size of a nickel held at arms length when viewed through binoculars. SOURCE said that if the object were to be constructed of known materials it would probably be of a silvery metallic substance shaped like a bowl. SOURCE reported that he was looking northwest when he first saw the object and also was looking northwest when the object disappeared. SOURCE indicated that when object was first noticed it was approximately 300 degrees from the horizon. When object disappeared it was approximately 300 degrees from the horizon. SOURCE reported thick clouds, dry weather, warm temperature and no wind during period of sighting. He stated this was the first time he had ever seen an object of this type. SOURCE unable to estimate speed of object but thought it was approximately 15 miles/hour. SOURCE residence is 4 miles NW of [redacted] (SOURCE, Part One). SOURCE is of the opinion that the object was an aircraft of some kind.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the preparing officer the sighting was probably an optical phenomena for the following reasons:

    a. Any celestial body that could have been mistaken for an unidentified object was not visible in that portion of the sky where the sighting occurred. In addition, the characteristic movement of a celestial body does not conform to the movement of the object described by SOURCES. The object did not travel through the sky to its point of ultimate disappearance. The area travelled by object in the period of the sighting was approximately 150° according to description furnished by SOURCES. Object travelled a larger area than 150° in the 55 minutes it was observed. Following figures are given for reference purposes:

    Moon        140 31' in one hour
    Saturn      150 3' in one hour
    Jupiter     150 in one hour
    Venus       150 in one hour
    Mars        150 in one hour

    b. Weather balloons were not present in the area during the sighting period. In addition, no celestial body or other source of light was apparent that might possibly create a reflection of light on a balloon with the resultant effects noted by SOURCES. The apparent size of object would further preclude the possibility of a balloon.

    c. Research of possible aircraft in the area of sighting resulted in negative findings, with the exception of the single track reported by the 746th AC & T Squadron, Tinker AFB. The movement, moreover, of the object as described by SOURCES does not fit the normal pattern of aircraft movement. In flight, SOURCES, however, reported seeing an aircraft in flight at the same time he saw the unidentified object.

    d. The characteristics of the object as described by SOURCES precludes the possibility that this sighting was a meteor.

    e. Characteristics of the object as reported by three SOURCES generally confirm the optical phenomena hypothesis. The possibility exists that meteorological conditions prevailing during this sighting, such as temperature inversions, may have been contributing factors to the occurrence of this sighting.

Reference - UFOB (Cardmore AFB, 12 May)

Having reviewed the O-15 camera film enclosed with this report, I feel there is no evidence to support this claim. Some of the returns on the scope. Some of the report information for a detailed analysis is not available (Scope Range, inherent errors, introduced delay, and rotation calibration). However, based on the apparent speed of aircraft in the area and considering an average among them - there does not appear to be any returns moving in the category as mentioned in the report (40 m pm).

At exactly 1420Z, 12 May 1956 Perrin AFB (Tower) called this station and reported that a Mr _______, the local fire Marshall of Healdton, Oklahoma and another man called Ardmore Tower to report that they had seen an object flying at approximately 40 miles per minute flying from east to west. Ardmore Tower passed the word to Perrin tower so as to call this station and see if the subject target was appearing on our weapon. Not target was observed by anyone at this station on the weapon or otherwise.

At approximately 2024Z, Captain Kandt, the controller at division (Oklahoma) advised that we scramble fighters (F-86D1s) to have a look at this unknown track. Subj act fighters reported that they sighted nothing. Fighters were then turned back to base.

At exactly 2030Z, 12 May 1956, Perrin Tower relayed more information to this station. The information originated from Ardmore Tower. The Directors Log for this description reads as follows: "More info on(UFO) object seems to be egg shaped" shining surface on bottom and dull on top. Object last seen by Hilton (Healdton) Okla Fire Marshall heading from east to west at approximately 40 miles amin last seen at 0828 (GMT).

Weather at time of sighting was estimated at 2300 overcast, visibility 10 miles, wind SSW at 10 with gusts to 21. Clouds were broken. Lighting conditions Daylight. Air traffic in the vicinity at the time was light to moderate. The Grid coordinates for the position of the sighting was HG3515.

Advise that a direct report be obtained from the personnel that were on duty at Ardmore Tower at time of sighting, since this organization has no means of communication to Ardmore Tower, in which case a first hand report cannot be obtained.

During the time of the sighting the O-15 Fairchild scope camera was in operation and approximately 75 ft of film was exposed, although no UFOB were observed on this stations Weapon the film is being forwarded for evaluation. COMAD Form 6 is also being forwarded.

I. SOURCE:
    Address:                Terrace, Oklahoma City, Okla.
    Age:    24

    Occupation: Officer USAF, Special Projects Office, Engineering
               Branch, Industrial Engineering Division, Directorate
               of Maintenance Engineering, OGAMA, Tinker AFB, Okla.

    Education: BS, Chemical and Industrial Engineering, Massachusetts
               Institute of Technology

    Qualifications: SOURCE has been on active duty for approximately
                    one year and is a graduate of a highly reputable
                    engineering school.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appeared to be highly intelligent and completely sincere.
    All questions were answered frankly and in those instances where
    SOURCE could not answer a question, a native reply was given without attempts to create answers where none existed. SOURCE was cooperative throughout the investigation and expressed the opinion that he realized the importance of turning in reports of this type. No reason was apparent to indicate
    SOURCE was motivated by any purpose in submitting his information except to
    be of help in solving the sighting. SOURCE was unable to make estimates of
    heights and distances involved in the sighting.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 6 May 1956 between
    the hours of 2210 and 2305 CST he observed a teacup shaped, translucent,
    intensely bright, orange-colored object in the northwest sector of the sky,
    (Incl #4, Sketch of Object). SOURCE indicated the object appeared to be
    manned. Incl #2, Pattern of Sighting. SOURCE described object as moving
    as stationary in the sky for a few minutes, then darting rapidly in a northerly direction. This type of movement was repeated forming a zig-zag pattern. Progress of the object appeared to be westerly, except for alternate
    darts toward the north. Object finally disappeared on the western horizon.
    (Incl #2, Pattern of Object). Object did not emit exhaust trails and no
    audible sound was noticed. SOURCE stated the object was brighter than any
    other object in that portion of the sky where the sighting was noted. SOURCE said he noticed a few stars in the sky but no moonlight. Brightness
    of the object was comparable to that of automobile headlight approximately
    two city blocks away. Object did not break into parts, change shape, give
    off smoke or change brightness. However, SOURCE reported that the object
    appeared to throb or pulsate. During period of sighting object did not more
    than 30° from vertical. SOURCE viewed object with 6X30
    binoculars and indicated the object was sharply outlined. SOURCE could not
    estimate the real size of object in its longest dimensions, but
    stated it was approximately the size of a dime held at arms length. SOURCE

I. SOURCE:
Address: Oklahoma City, Okla.
Age: 24
Occupation: Officer USAF, Special Projects Office, Engineering Branch, Industrial Engineering Division, Directorate of Maintenance Engineering, OCAMA, Tinker AFB, Okla.
Education: BS, Chemical and Industrial Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Qualifications: SOURCE has been on active duty for approximately one year and is a graduate of a highly reputable engineering school.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appeared to be highly intelligent and completely sincere. All questions were answered frankly and in those instances where SOURCE could not answer a question, a negative reply was given without attempts to create answers where none existed. SOURCE was cooperative throughout the investigation and expressed the opinion that he realized the importance of turning in reports of this type. No reason was apparent to indicate SOURCE was motivated by purpose in submitting this information except to be of help in solving the sighting. SOURCE was unable to make estimates of heights and distances involved in the sighting.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 6 May 1956 between the hours of 2210 and 2305 GST he observed a teacup shaped, translucent, intensely bright, orange-colored object in the northwest sector of the sky, (Incl #1, Sketch of Object). SOURCE indicated the object appeared to be stationary in the sky for a few minutes, then darting rapidly in a northerly direction. This type of movement was repeated forming a zig-zag pattern. Progress of the object appeared to be westerly, except for alternate darts toward the north. Object finally disappeared on the western horizon. (Incl #2, Pattern of Object). Object did not emit exhaust trails and no audible sound was noticed. SOURCE stated the object was brighter than any other object in that portion of the sky where the sighting was noted.

SOURCE said he noticed a few stars in the sky but no moonlight. Brightness of the object was comparable to that of automobile headlight approximately two city blocks away. Object did not break into parts, change shape, give off smoke or change brightness. However, SOURCE reported that the object appeared to throw or drop or eject something periodically that did not move in front of anything or behind anything. SOURCE viewed object with 6X30 binoculars and indicated the object was sharply outlined. SOURCE could not guess or estimate the real size of object in its longest dimensions, but stated it was approximately the size of a dime held at arms length.

SOURCE reported that if the object could be constructed of known materials it would probably be a plastic-like substance. SOURCE indicated he first observed the object from outside his residence for about 10 minutes and then drove his car approximately 10 minutes while observing the object. He traveled in a northerly direction at approximately 35 MPH. SOURCE reported he first noticed object in the northwest and saw it for the last time in the northwest.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appeared to be of average intelligence. Answers to questions were given in a forthright manner with no attempts to procrastinate. SOURCE was very cooperative throughout the investigation and appeared sincerely anxious to help find a solution for the sighting.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 6 May 1956 at approximately 2205 CST while checking the sky for weather conditions he noted a bright object in the western sky below the clouds. SOURCE'S attention was attracted to the object because of its exceptional brightness. SOURCE stated he viewed the object for approximately 50 minutes using 6X30 power binoculars. SOURCE reported the object was sharply outlined, like a bowl, and rimmed with lights. Light appeared to be individual but were too numerous to count. (incl #1, Sketch of object). For the first 30 minutes of the sighting object appeared to hover in a small portion of sky and appeared to move in a somewhat erratic manner similar to an aircraft in rough air. After about 30 minutes object appeared to be moving in a westerly direction and slowly passed out of sight over the western horizon. SOURCE indicated he saw a few stars through the northwest portion of sky and a brighter than the background of the sky and was comparable to the brightness of an automobile headlight at approximately 0.5 degree. Object did not break into parts, give off smoke or change shape. However, it did change brightness from time to time and seemed to pulsate or throb. SOURCE stated he noted an aircraft above and in front of the object in a northwesterly direction of an aircraft other than that it was not a jet. Object did not move in front of anything at any time during the sighting. SOURCE said he thought the object was solid. There was no audible sound during the sighting. SOURCE indicated he saw only one object and estimated that the real size of the object at its longest dimension was approximately 100 feet. SOURCE was certain object appeared to be in a nickel length at arms length when viewed through binoculars. SOURCE said that if the object were to be constructed of known materials it would probably be of a silvery metallic substance shaped like a bowl. SOURCE reported that he was looking northwest when he first saw the object and also was looking northwest when the object disappeared. SOURCE indicated that when object was first noticed at was approximately 300 degrees from true north and 0 degrees above horizon, and approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. When object disappeared it was approximately 300 degrees from true north and 0 degrees above horizon. SOURCE stated this was the first time he had ever seen an object of this type. SOURCE was unable to estimate speed of object but thought it was approximately 15 miles an hour. SOURCE'S residence is 1/2 miles NW of Bert Billington Beals' residence.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the preparing officer the sighting was probably an optical phenomena for the following reasons:

    a. Any celestial body that could have been mistaken for an unidenti-
    fied object was not visible in that portion of the sky where the sighting occurred.

    In addition, the characteristic movement of a celestial body does not conform
    to the movement of the object described by SOURCES, and its pattern of travel
    through the sky to its point of ultimate disappearance. The area traveled by
    object in the period of time specified by SOURCES would not be characteristic
    of a celestial body. Any celestial body with the exception of planets and the
    moon will move approximately 15° per hour. According to description furnished
    by SOURCES, object traveled a larger area than 15° in the 55 minutes it was
    observed. Following figures are given for reference purposes:

    Moon        14° 31' in one hour
    Saturn      15° 31' in one hour
    Jupiter     15° in one hour
    Venus       15° in one hour
    Mars        15° in one hour

    b. Weather balloons were not present in the area during the sighting
    period. In addition, no celestial body or other source of light was apparent
    that might possibly create a reflection or light on a balloon with the resultant
    effects noted by SOURCES. The apparent size of object would further preclude
    the possibility of a balloon.

    c. Research of possible aircraft in the area of sighting resulted in
    negative findings, with the exception of the single track reported by the 746th
    AQ & 7 Squadron, Tinker AFB. The movement, moreover, of the object as described
    by SOURCES does not fit the normal pattern of aircraft movement in flight.
    SOURCE, however, reported seeing an aircraft in flight at the same time he saw
    the unidentified object.

    d. The characteristics of the object as described by SOURCES precludes
    the possibility that this sighting was a meteor.

    e. Characteristics of the object as reported by three SOURCES gener-
    ally confirms the optical phenomena hypothesis. The possibility exists that
    meteorological conditions prevailing during the sighting, such as temperature
    inversions, may have been contributing factors to the occurrence of this sighting.

background, information may be considered reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was at his home when his attention
was called to the object by 2/Lt. [redacted] at approximately 2230
CST, 6 May 56. He went outside to view the object and kept it in sight
from 8 to 12 minutes. The section of sky involved was overcast with no
stars visible and no moonlight. Object was much brighter than background
of sky. Its brightness was like an auto headlight 3 blocks away. Object
appeared to pulsate when standing still, but did not change shape, or give
off smoke or vapor trails. Its brightness did not change while standing
still, but did diminish as object disappeared from view at a fairly steady
rate of speed. Object did not move in front or behind anything. It
appeared to be solid when viewed through 9X35 power binoculars.
There was no sound. Object was yellow-orange at first, turning more
orange as it disappeared over horizon. SOURCE described object as resem-
bling a round saucer suspended in the air. (Incl. #1). Object traveled
from 340 to 350 degrees laterally and from 20 to 0 degrees vertically
(incl. #2). SOURCE was unable to estimate real size of object, but stated that
