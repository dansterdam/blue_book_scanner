EVALUATION OF AIR DEFENSE INCIDENT OF 20 SEPTEMBER 1957

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

The objective of this study is to evaluate the circumstances associated with the detection and reporting of high-speed radar tracks on 20 September 1957. Specifically, the evaluation was aimed at determining whether or not the tracks were caused by airborne objects and to determine, if possible, the nature of the airborne vehicles or other phenomena which caused the tracks.

RESUME OF EVENTS

1. On 20 September 1957 at 1962Z, the 773d ACWRON, located at the Montauk AFS, New York, established an initial plot on a high speed unidentified object southeast of the station at a range of 190 nautical miles, and tracking toward the station at an estimated speed of 3600 knots. Track information was forward told to the 26th CONAD Division, CFCER, and to NORAD COC. In addition, it was passed laterally to adjacent radars; the 646th ACWRON at Highlands AFS, N.Y. and the 762d ACWRON at North Truro, Massachusetts. These radars were not able to establish contact with the target.

2. The unknown track was lost at a range of 50 miles southeast of Montauk at 1907:45Z. The track was dead-reckoned by Montauk AFS and passed by the 26th CONAD Division to the 646th ACWRON at Benton AFS, Pennsylvania, as heading west at a speed of 2,000 knots and an estimated altitude of 50,000 feet.

From Detection to Fade

a. Circumstances Related by the Montauk Operations

Personnel: Prior to the detection of the high speed track BB-6, the duty controller was engaged in an intercept over the Rocket and Gunnery Range south of the Montauk Station. Scope displays and the appearance of routine traffic seemed normal.

At approximately 1905:48z, a target return was observed on a PPI console at a range of approximately 210 n.mi. east southeast of the station. An initial track was established on it at 1906z,

Range 190 n.m., azimuth 170°, speed 3,600 knots. The scope operator immediately called this track to the attention of the duty controller and the floor supervisor. The three operations personnel observed this track throughout its course until it faded at approximately 50 n.m. southeast of the station. This fade occurred within the M. T.&r. area. The average speed of the track over its entire length was 5,400 knots. At the time of the incident, there were 3 UPA-35, 4 GPS-23 consoles and one height scope in operation.

The basis for the altitude estimation on track BB-6 was so unreliable the NORAD team was forced to disregard it. Derivation of height associated with part of track BB-6 is discussed later in this report.

The target was detected and tracked on a UPA-35 scope but it was not observed on the height finder nor on any other scope in the operations room; however, due to the short time that this target was carried, it was impossible for the operations personnel to evaluate or assess the conditions of the other scopes in the operations room. No jamming or intense interference were present at this time and weather in this area was low overcast with slight rain. Further weather analysis is included later.

Upon receipt of the initial target information, the 26th AD alerted other related sites within the 26th AD area to be on the lookout for this high speed track. The stations initially alerted were Highlands and North Truro. Subsequently, Claysburg, Pa., Benton, Pa., and Lockport, N.Y. were alerted as a result of

dead-reckoned pre-plot information. None of these stations except
Benton, Pa., detected anything that could possibly have been
correlated with track BB-6. Antiaircraft units in the area of the
track penetration were also advised but were unable to obtain contact with this target. Texas Tower #2, the picket ships and AEW
stations in the area did not report unusual, high speed targets
during this time.

The characteristics of the target blip described by
the three operations personnel indicated that this return appeared
realistic insofar as shape and size were concerned. The initial
target return observed at 210 n.mi. was thought to be that of an
aircraft showing Mark X identification. Several sweeps later the
Mark X beacon control at the scope was placed in the off position
but the target characteristics remained the same. As the target
approached the station, the size diminished but the intensity remained the same. Tracking continuity and blip/scan were 100%
throughout the entire track.

The FPS-20 was operating on Channel 2 during this
period. At 1910Z, Channel 2 failed and the set went off the air.
Thirty seconds later Channel 1 was in operation. A defective tube
in the modulator caused the above failure. Set operation and
console noise level appeared normal during the time of the incident.

b. NORAD Team Observations: At 2000Z on 25 September,
the NORAD team observed a series of random blips on a UPA-35 console. These blips occurred at a constant azimuth of 160° but at
various ranges. The operations personnel involved in the 20

September incident were called to observe this and they immediately identified the blips as being exactly the same as those observed on 20 September. The variations in ranges were to some degree uniform in their appearance, i.e., the blips would occur at approximately 210 n.m.i., approach the station at speeds of 3,000 to 3,500 knots for 3 or 4 sweeps then would appear at a different range unacceptable to track coherence. Other scopes in the operations room were also displaying these blips. This condition was observed throughout the night by the operations personnel at Montauk. The next morning the transmitter was changed to Channel 1 and the condition disappeared. At the request of the NORAD team, on the evening of 26 September, the site changed back to Channel 2 and the condition again appeared.

The following is a summary of the most important characteristics of, and technical environment surrounding, the Montauk target phenomenon on 20 September 1957.

At the initial stage of detection, this object's electronic configuration was described as similar to that of B-52 type aircraft when observed at long range, with the exception of its speed. Several sweeps later the electronic configuration of this target changed to that of a smaller object, yet the heading of the target and its aspect remained constant. Normal target returns from conventional or jet type aircraft do not reflect such radical changes in their size as this target did unless they undergo radical changes in aspect ratio. In fact, it is very difficult for experienced operators to detect changes in target size when the aircraft

is maintaining a constant track. UNCLASSIFIED

The target intensity of track BB-6 remained constant throughout the entire tracking period. Normal target returns fluctuate in intensity to such a degree that the condition is visually obvious to the operator.

Tracking was continuous and the blip/scan ratio was 1.0 over the entire track. A 1.0 blip/scan ration on conventional and jet aircraft without beacon or Mark X is a rare occurrence under normal operation.

The fact that this target was of such size to sustain a 1.0 blip/scan ratio at Montauk AFS would indicate that other stations within detection distances certainly should have received some indication of this track.

Mutual Interference, that is, interference of one rotating radar with another rotating radar operating at or fairly close to the same operational parameters will normally produce "spirals" occurring at the outer edge of the PPI scope and spiraling into the center of the scope along with extremely high background noise levels. The noise level on the scope, of course, is proportional to the power transmitted by the interfering radar. It was impossible to associate track BB-6 with previously experienced mutual interference patterns of two rotating radars. It would be possible, however, to generate a condition of this sort with a fixed-antenna type radar operating at or close to the frequency and PRF of the rotating radar. The team was unable to ascertain the location of any fixed radar stations in that area that could produce such a

condition. The non-rotating radar station would have to have mobility in view of the movement of this phenomenon from one azimuth to another over a period of several days, and its installation would have had to have been made recently due to the absence of this type phenomenon in the past.

3. BENTON AFS: Benton Air Force Station is located approximately 35 n.mi. NW of Wilkes-Barre, Pa. The following is a list of equipment and operating parameters associated with this station at the time of the incident:

Primary Search Equipment         AN/FPS-10 (2700-3020 mc)
Height Finding Equipment         AN/FPS-6 (2700-2900 mc)
Antenna Rotation Rate             5 rpm
Antenna Tilt (Electrical)         Search 1.5°

a. Circumstances Related By Benton Operations Personnel:
Prior to detection of high speed track BB-6, traffic and scope presentations at Benton were normal. At 1755Z and 1755Z two SAC aircraft requested permission to run ECM against Benton. The duty controller advised approval and the two aircraft commenced chaff runs at 1805Z and 1810Z, respectively. Aircraft dropped chaff in streams north of the station extending west to approximately 220 n.mi. Chaff dispensing ended at 1832Z and 1835Z. The residual effects of the chaff cloud were visible on the radar consoles for over an hour's period.

UNCLASSIFIED

At 1916Z, Benton received four overlap pre-plots from 26th AD Control Center on an unidentified target said to be heading west at 2,000 knots with an estimated altitude of 50,000 feet. At 1917Z Benton detected a target on the vertical upper beam heading northwest with an estimated speed of 920 knots. This target was correlated as being BB-6 from Montauk. The track was carried on VU until contact was lost at a point approximately 135 n.mi. northwest of the station. It was again picked up on vertical center and tracked until it faded at 1926Z. No further pickup on this track was made.

At 1924Z the second track was detected on VU 75 n.mi. north of the station heading 290°, estimated speed 1,200 knots. This track had no correlation and was numbered BE-111. It was carried on VU until contact was lost at a point approximately 145 n.mi. northwest of the station. It was again picked up on vertical center at 160 n.mi. northwest and carried until it faded at 190 n.mi., 305°. Both tracks were interrogated by Mark X with no response. All track information was passed to the ACW site at Lockport and Claysburg but these sites did not detect either of these tracks. Lockport was off the air for maintenance during the entire time Benton was tracking and did not return to operation until 1935Z, one minute after the track BE-111 faded. Lockport observed the residual effects of the chaff drop. Anti-aircraft units in the area of concern did not report any unusual, high-speed target activity.

B-58 aircraft activity was considered as a possible cause for the track at Benton AFS; however, a message to WADC established that no B-58s were flying in this area at this time.

UNCLASSIFIED

Technical data and radar performance characteristics associated with B-58 aircraft are non-existent at this time and as a consequence, the NORAD team was without a capability to effectively assess the target data derived and properly associate this data with B-58 characteristics.

At the time of the incident, Benton had one OA-99 PPI console on each of the three vertical beams and the Air Surveillance Officer used a fourth OA-99 to monitor all beams. Of these, only one OA-99, manned by two airmen, displayed the targets (first on the VU and then on the VC beams). No detection of B6-6 or BE-111 was made on any other scope in the station. No detections were made on FPS-6 or on the VL or search beam of the FPS-10. The operating parameters of the FPS-10 were within normal operating limits. Weather at this station was low overcast with slight drizzle.

b. NORAD Team Observations: The NORAD team was unable to duplicate the above condition by scope analysis. All scopes had indications of interference patterns typical of those that would be generated by interference from other radars. The technical parameters associated with this type interference should not produce crossing tracks. The degree of this interference was not sufficient to deteriorate the performance of the station. The radar returns as described by the operations personnel indicate that these returns were not characteristic of normal radar targets. Except for the high rate of speed and unexplained variations in speed, the blips described a normal aircraft track. These blips differed from normal returns in that they were found in shape with

a slight fuzziness around the periphery and were estimated to be about twice the diameter of a return from a B-52 at maximum radar range. The intensity of the blips remained constant throughout the entire track.

Tracking continuity and blip-scan ratio was 1.0.

The following is a summary of the characteristics of, and technical environment surrounding, the Benton target phenomenon on 20 Septem- ber 1957.

The two tracks did not possess qualities of normal radar returns, i.e., they had a 1.0 blip-scan ratio throughout the entire tracking period. They maintained a constant target intensity. The size and shape varied considerably from that of normal returns and they were not detected on the search or vertical lower beams. Targets having returns as strong and persistent as these should be seen on all beams of an FPS-10. Only one scope in the station displayed this track and detection could not be made on the height finder. In addition, other sites in the immediate area were alerted sufficiently in advance to acclimate themselves to the situation, yet no other detections were made by these other stations.

It should be noted that Lockport was off for maintenance and did not return to operation until one minute after the target faded at Benton. The 1.0 blip-scan Ratio at Benton and the target location at the time of the fade would indicate the track should have been detected by Lockport.

The detection and fading characteristics of these targets were completely abnormal. The screening angles for Benton AFS do not exceed 0° throughout the area of concern. The tracks were detected well within the

(7) Other applicable units were checked.

In brief, the conclusions are as follows:

a. From the information and data studied from all pertinent units it appears that the tracks were from separate causes; and, in fact none of them information appears to be contradictory.

b. No hostile or unknown aircraft, missiles or vehicles were in the area at the time and places of the radar sightings. The UFOs were concluded to have been caused by radar-equipment malfunction and interference.

line of site capabilities of the station and faded well within the
line of site capabilities of the station. Both detection and fade plots
were at 1.0 blip-scan ratio.

EVALUATION

1. Operational Procedures: Operational procedures as demonstrated
by the NORAD system and its subordinate elements were as specified by
appropriate operational directives. Weapon commitment procedures were
appropriate to the speed, altitude and radar tracking characteristics of
the target track.

a. Montauk AFS: The actions of the radar surveillance personnel
were commendable in that during a 2-minute period the target was detected,
initiated as a track, five position plots recorded and forward told to the
26th CONAD Air Division, and to adjacent radars.

It was noted that the height-range indicator at Montauk is
physically located so that it cannot be used on short notice. It was also
noted that radar scope photo equipment was not readily available to obtain
a photographic record of this track.

b. Benton AFS: The operation at Benton, Pa., was in accordance
with current operational directives. The target was detected and passed
to adjacent radars and to higher echelons. A determined effort to collect
data was made.

It was noted that radar scope cameras were committed to a
training program and were not employed to record this track.

c. 26th CONAD Air Division: The control center personnel promptly
noted the track, assembled personnel of authority and passed track information

to other concerned radars and to higher echelons.

d. CONAD Forces Eastern CONAD Region: The Combat Operations Center personnel promptly noted the track and properly passed track information to those Air Defense Divisions along the probable flight path of the object. The appropriate divisions were placed on increased readiness. Interceptors were scrambled ahead of the track along its dead-reckoned course.

e. NORAD: Operational procedures at the NORAD Combat Operations Center were in accordance with current directives. Track information was passed to CONAD Forces Central CONAD Region in time for them to have interceptors on CAP along the probable flight path of the track. Preliminary information on this track and on NORAD actions were passed to the SAC Control Center and to the USAF Command post.

2. Analysis of Track Overlays: The most obvious feature of the two segments of Track BB-6, and one which contributed most directly to the original correlation, was the similarity of their courses. The first portion carried by Montauk described a course of approximately 289° while the course of the second portion carried by Benton was about 278°. A line drawn along the "average" course of the first segment and extended to the area where the second part of the track was established passes within about 20 miles of the point of detection of the second segment. Courses of radar tracks on bomber aircraft are seldom more consistent than this.

The first track segment appeared to curve slightly toward the west just prior to its fade. This change in course was based on only one or two returns; however, after discussing the track with the station operating personnel it was concluded that this change was well within the normal variations caused by plotting errors. This turn then, may not have actually occurred.

UNCLASSIFIED
13

The speeds of the two portions, while far less consistent than the courses, were compatible enough to preclude discounting a correlation on the basis of speed. The track carried by Montauk attained a length of about 143 n.mi. in 95 seconds, giving an average speed of 5,400 knots (as opposed to 3,600 reported on the initial plot). Although the time period over which the track was carried by Montauk was too short to provide accurate estimates of speed changes, it appears that the track speed was, if anything, increasing. The last two plots, covering a 15-second time span, advanced the track approximately 45 n.mi. giving an average speed of about 10,000 knots for this portion of the track. Again it is emphasized that these estimates must be viewed with caution because of the very short observation time.

The second part of BB-6 covered a distance of 128 n.mi. in a period of 8 minutes. The average speed was about 960 knots. The plots in this track segment indicate a speed of above 1,200 knots at the beginning and end of the track and a speed slightly below 900 knots in the middle portion of the track. Track BE-111, which paralleled the segment of BB-6 carried by Benton, achieved a length of 205 n.mi. in 10 minutes for an average speed of 1,230 knots.

Since the speeds of the two segments of BB-6 differ by a factor of nearly six to one, a logical attempt to correlate the two segments can be made only if one assumes that the track decreased in speed during the 10 1/4 minutes it was dead-reckoned. On the basis of the two average speeds, i. e., 5,400 knots and 960 knots, an average deceleration of 26,600 knots per hour would be required over the entire 10 1/4 minutes to account for the

UNCLASSIFIED

speed difference. If the track had decelerated at this rate it should have progressed about 530 n.mi. during the dead-reckoned period instead of the 280 miles it actually did travel. Since neither segment indicated a marked deceleration it would be more logical to suppose that if the track decelerated, it did so only for a part of the dead-reckoned time. In this case, the time and distance correlation would have been even less acceptable.

Except for the high blip-scan ratio observed at each station, there was virtually no similarity in the scope displays on the track segments. The return seen at Montauk appeared to represent a normal target. The blips were approximately the same size and shape as normal target returns and the only discrepancy observed was the relatively great decrease in blip size as the track approached the station. The returns seen at Benton were larger than normal blips and appeared round in shape. All blips in Benton's track were identical and exhibited none of the variations in size or intensity characteristic of real target returns. The manner in which the second portion of the track faded was entirely unrealistic for an outbound track. The blips remained large and round out to the point where the fade occurred and at this point the "paints" abruptly stopped.

The fade on the portion of BB-6 carried by Montauk was more abrupt than would be expected for such persistent returns but is believed that a real track could fade in this manner.

To summarize the discussion on track correlation: the correlation in the courses of the two segments of BB-6 is remarkably good while the correlation in time and distance, even assuming a highly unlikely speed profile, is questionable. There seems to be no similarity between the scope displays seen at the two stations. Track PE-111 carried by Benton

must be considered an extra track which correlates with neither of the other segments.

3. Characteristics of Airborne Objects: The ADC Range Coverage Indicator was used in an attempt to determine the characteristics of an airborne object which could produce tracks similar to the ones observed at Benton.

Using an average range based on the range at which the target was last observed on the VU lobe and the range of initial detection on the VC lobe, an estimate of target size and altitude was made. It was found that a plus 10 db target at 135,000 feet is the smallest object that could be lost on the VU lobe and be detected on the VC lobe at approximately this range. Applying the same procedure to the range at which the target disappeared from the VC team, it was determined that the smallest object which could produce this effect would be a minus 2 db target at 120,000 feet. This information is shown graphically in the following figure:

[A graph is present with altitude (in feet) on the y-axis ranging from 115,000 to 135,000 feet, and target size (in decibels) on the x-axis ranging from -4 to 10. The graph has a hatched triangular area.]

The bottom of the page is marked "UNCLASSIFIED" and has a page number "16".


- page 17 -

UNCLASSIFIED

The cross-hatched area of the figure represents the limits of the characteristics of an object which could produce the tracks observed at Benton; however, two major discrepancies must be noted concerning the above target size and altitude data:

a. No known type of airborne object should produce a 1.0 blip-scan ratio during the entire length of the track from its initial detection to its abrupt disappearance.

b. Based on the above target size and altitude estimates, the RCI indicates that the observed tracks were also within the detection capability of the VI. and search kit beams; therefore, the tracks should have been detected in these beams.

4. Missile Characteristics:

a. Possibility of Cruise Type Missile: Tracking subsequent to the first pickup indicated a speed of approximately 5,400 knots or Mach 9. Considering the so-called heat or thermal barrier problem this would be an extension of the state of the art so far beyond present day accomplishments as to be considered impossible for some time to come. In order to escape the heat barrier an airplane flying at this speed would have to fly above 300,000 feet. This again is so far beyond present day accomplishment as to be considered extremely unlikely. On the other hand, if we consider only the second pickup (by Benton), the ground speed of that portion (approximately 1,000 knots) would be consistent with the present state of the art.

b. Possibility of Ballistic Missile: A horizontal speed of Mach 9 is consistent with a 900 n.mi. range ballistic missile. The 1,000 knot portion of the track is also consistent with ballistic missile re-entry

17 UNCLASSIFIED

speeds; however, a ballistic missile would re-enter the atmosphere and
land in a period of 30 to 200 seconds and cover only 20-40 miles while
doing so, whereas, the track carried by Benton extended over 100 miles
and about 8 minutes subsequent to detection. Similarly, the second track
carried by Benton fails to demonstrate the deceleration characteristics
of a ballistic missile re-entry. Thus, if we consider the two pickups
to be on the same object, it seems unlikely that the object was a bal-
listic missile.

c. To summarize: Considering the two tracks as a unit it seems
very unlikely that the object was either a cruise type or a ballistic
missile.

Considering tracking on the first segment only, one might
conclude that it could have been a ballistic missile.

Considering tracking subsequent to the second pickup only,
one might conclude that it could have been a cruise type missile.

5. Meteor Characteristics: Meteors were also considered as a possible
cause of high speed radar tracks. It was hypothesized that a meteor
approaching the earth at a relatively large angle (as measured from the
horizontal) might produce a track having a horizontal component of velocity
which could correlate with the portion of track BB-6 observed from Montauk.
Upon closer examination, however, it appears that such a hypothesis is
untenable.

Meteors penetrating the earth's atmosphere can be detected
and tracked by radar, but the results of research in this area indicate
that it would be extremely unlikely that a radar return from a meteor would

BB-6. Observations made by the U. S. Bureau of Standards show that the radar frequency is an important factor in the tracking of meteors. Radar returns are obtained more from the ionized gases surrounding the meteor than from the meteor itself, and as the radar frequency is increased more of the energy should pass through the ionized cloud rather than reflecting from it. In general, successful meteor tracking has been achieved only with radars having frequencies below about 60 mc. Since the frequency of the FPS-20 is over twenty times as high as this, it is extremely doubtful that it would even detect a meteor. Perhaps the ionized "trail" could be detected particularly after it had sufficient time to expand into a larger target, but such a return would not appear as a fast moving object.

A consideration of meteor speeds only serves to discount further the possibility that any of the tracks could have been caused by meteors. During the past twenty years, several thousand meteors have been observed scientifically, i.e., accurate records of their speed and trajectory have been made. Data on the velocities of over 10,000 meteors studied by Stanford and Harvard Universities* show that meteor velocities below 35,000 knots are rare, and none of the observations showed velocities below 23,000 knots. These studies also indicate that meteor trails, i.e., heating of the meteor to incandescence and ionization of gases rarely begin above 65 n.mi. or extend below a height of 25 n.mi.

A meteor approaching the earth at a velocity of 23,000 knots would have to follow a path inclined at least 77° from the horizontal in

order to produce a horizontal component of velocity of 5,000 knots
(the approximate average velocity of the first segment of BB-6). In the
nearly two minutes (95 seconds) that Montauk carried the track, a meteor
at this velocity would travel about 575 n.m.i. in the vertical plane. Thus,
detection would have had to be made when the object was at least 575 miles
above the surface of the earth.

On the other hand, a meteor at 23,000 knots, following a
trajectory flat enough to be tracked for 95 seconds by radar, i. e., within
100 miles of the earth's surface, would travel nearly 600 n.m. horizontally
at a horizontal velocity of 22,500 knots.

To Summarize: A meteor following a trajectory having a hori-
zontal component of velocity consistent with the speed of track BB-6 as
seen at Montauk would have had to be detected nearly 600 miles above the
earth's surface without benefit of a cloud or trail of ionized gas. Such
a feat is considered extremely unlikely for a rotating, surveillance radar.
A meteor remaining close enough to the earth's surface to afford even a
remote possibility, of being tracked for 95 seconds would have to travel at
a speed of at least 22,000 knots.

6. Aurora Borealis: Aurora Borealis was also a factor considered
by the team as having possible effects of this nature. Research into past
history on the subject indicates all known auroral effects in the radar
frequency spectrum produces receiver saturation by random noise, creating an
entirely different scope condition from those observed during this incident.
No instances have been recorded where auroral effects have produced just one
or two tracks similar to those observed at the Montauk station.

In 1953, an evaluation and detailed report was made on a phenomenon existing at Cutbank, Montana, called "Pipsqueaks." This phenomenon could not in any way be associated with the 20 September 1957 incident by the NORAD team.

7. Weather: Immediately following the incident, the Division Weather Officer analyzed weather and atmospheric conditions prevailing in the 26th Division. This analysis was based primarily on soundings and reported weather conditions. In general, this analysis showed no ducts, inversions or other conditions which could account for high speed radar tracks.

A similar analysis was performed by members of the 3d Weather Group, Hq. ADC. The results of this analysis verified the findings of the Division Weather Officer.

Weather forecasts and soundings from the four weather stations closest to the area in which the tracks were observed are included in Attachment II. It should be noted that the only indication of a refractive layer is found in the plots of B units (refractive index) from Idlewild. This layer was not strong, however, and was at a higher altitude than are layers which normally cause false targets.

To summarize: Two independent studies of the available weather data by qualified weather officers failed to reveal conditions which are known to produce anomalous propagation or false targets. If weather conditions prevailing on 20 September did produce these high speed tracks, one would expect the occurrence of such tracks to be the rule rather than the exception.

8. Equipment Malfunction: Montauk Air Force Station has recently had the AN/FPS-3 search radar modified into an AN/FPS-20. The station has, in

3. Alleged High-Speed "UFOs" Traced from Montauk, New York and Heading towards SAC Headquarters, Nebraska - 20 September 1957

a. Commander, ATIC, was requested by Deputy ACS/I, Headquarters USAF to provide full particulars and other related information regarding a reported potential, very high-speed unidentified object alleged to have been picked up near Montauk, N.Y., passing over Buffalo, towards SAC Headquarters at Offutt AFB, Nebraska. The incident resulted in an immediate alert by both SAC and ADC.

b. Detailed report of the incident based on investigations and analyses conducted:

(1) Track was picked up originally by the radar unit at Montauk, N.Y. at 19062 time, 20 September 1957. It was picked up by Benton, Pa., unit at 19182.

(2) The radar units at Highlands, N.Y., N. Truro, Mass., Lockport, N.Y. and Claysburg, Pa. were alerted. However, these units could not make contact with the supposed target.

(3) F-102 aircraft were scrambled from Kirross AFB (ADC) (Michigan) as well as additional F-102's from Truax AFB (Wisconsin) as the target was reported bearing on a predicted track in that direction. No contact made; nothing unusual found. The tracks faded at this point. (Significant to point out that the last observed track was in the vicinity of Benton, Pa., and not in the vicinity of SAC Hq as reported to ATIC). Weather conditions: overcast and rain.

(4) NORAD set a radar team to study this incident, including similar targets if they should appear.

(5) On 25 September, a radar team noted a series of blips on the radarscope of the Montauk, N.Y. Station, the unit originally reporting tracking the tracks. The tracks were "exactly identical" to those of 20 September. When the channel (frequency) was changed the blips disappeared. They reappeared when the original frequency was turned in. A first malfunction or interference from a radar set having a non-rotating antenna was considered the most probable cause for this.

(6) Meanwhile, a check of the Benton, Pa. radar unit disclosed that two SAC aircraft were dropped "Streams of radar chaff" near the station on the day of the incident. It was also determined that the detection and characteristics of these targets were completely abnormal, probably caused by equipment malfunction.

the past, experienced technical difficulties in several major components of the equipment. None of these were serious enough, however, to induce long periods of breakdown or degradation of operational performance.

The NORAD team could not find any specific source of component malfunction that could contribute to the cause of the 20 September phenomena. The circumstantial evidence associated with the 20 September phenomenon such as the observation by the NORAD team of a condition similar to that observed by the operations personnel on 20 September would indicate erratic performance of some electronic component within the equipment. One member of the NORAD team has been closely associated with the technical development of the FPS-20 since its inception. It was indicated by this member during the evaluation that certain electronic components of this equipment, on rare occasions, would produce random noise known as "angel effects." These effects are similar to those experienced on 20 September by the Montauk station. The similarity, however, is not conclusive enough that the incident can be attributed to this effect. Further technical analysis must be accomplished before "angel effects" can be either accepted or rejected as a cause.

At Benton Air Force Station, the NORAD team was unable to find any specific cases of malfunction of the AN/CPS-6B that would contribute to the 20 September phenomenon. The station has experienced only those minor equipment difficulties, all of them common to the AN/CPS-6B over long periods of sustained operation. The circumstantial evidence associated with this phenomenon, such as the pick-up and fade characteristics of the target, the appearance of the target on only one scope, the

inability of the equipment to track the target on vertical, lower, and search beams, and the lack of height-finder detection would indicate erratic performance of some electronic component within the equipment. That component malfunction was the cause of the phenomenon can only be verified on the basis of further technical analysis.

CONCLUSION

1. In studying the characteristics of these high-speed radar tracks, it was found that much of the information pertaining to them appeared to be unrelated or contradictory. Under these circumstances, it is very difficult and often impossible, to arrive at positive conclusions. None of the possible causes considered in the study could be supported indisputably as the one responsible for the tracks. The evaluation did show that certain of the explanations were much more tenable while others were rejected almost entirely. Therefore, the conclusions presented concerning the cause of tracks BB-6 and BE-111 are not stated in unequivocal terms as one would prefer conclusions to be, but rather they are statements of the relative probability that the tracks were the result of the various possible causes evaluated.

a. Despite the apparent track correlation between the two segments of track BB-6, it is highly probable that these two tracks resulted from separate, unrelated causes.

b. The most probable cause of track BB-6 carried by Montauk is believed to be either a circuit malfunction or interference from a radar

having a non-rotating [illegible] causes, the former is considered
the more likely.

c. The most probable cause of track BB-6 and BE-111 carried by
Benton is believed to be equipment malfunction. External interference is
not considered a probable cause.

d. Estimates of the altitude of BE-111 and the portion of BB-6
carried by Benton are highly questionable. Estimates of the altitude of
BB-6 carried by Montauk are totally without basis.

e. It is considered highly improbable that any of the track
segments were caused by either meteors or auroral effects.

f. Although weather phenomena cannot be completely discounted,
it is believed improbable that the tracks observed at Benton were a result
of any known weather or atmospheric conditions.

g. Since weather data are not available from areas over the
ocean, it is possible that unknown weather conditions could have caused
the track observed at Montauk. On the basis of available data, however,
weather is not considered a probable cause of the first segment of track
BB-6.

h. On the basis of known missile capabilities, it is possible
that a ballistic missile could simulate the trajectory of BB-6 as ob-
served at Montauk and that the trajectory of a cruise missile could re-
semble BE-111 or the second portion of BB-6. Neither of these are con-
sidered probable causes.

i. Operational functions of the NORAD system were within
established time criteria and in accordance with existing directives.

Mr. [redacted]

(Paraphrased) Reference inquiries regarding Martha's Vineyard radar incident evaluation requested by General W., civil particulars are in. In brief, report not entirely correct that radar units made observation all the way across to point supposedly a target.

Track was picked up originally by two stations in New York. First contact was at Montauk, N. Y. However, radar units along line (paraphrase) to S were alerted. These units did not see target on radarscopes.

F 102 aircraft were scrambled from various bases in Michigan as well as Wisconsin. No contacts made, nothing unusual found, and tracks faded at this point.

A radar team was set up to study this incident, including similar targets if they should appear. On 25 September the radar investigating team was in the original radar unit that sighted the tracks. Exactly identical tracks appeared. Mean frequency was changed to two channel blips appeared. They reappeared when the previous channel was tuned back in.

A check of the second radar unit disclosed that there were two SAC aircraft in the area which dropped "streams of radar chaff" near the station on the date of sighting. It was also determined that the detection and characteristics of the targets observed were completely abnormal. The other applicable units were also checked by this investigative team.

CONCLUSION:

In brief the conclusions are as follows:

a. The information and data studied from all pertinent units appeared to be unrelated and in fact contradictory to each other.

b. It is, therefore, difficult if not impossible to draw any valid conclusions, although there is no compelling reason or indications that the tracks were hostile, or unknown aircraft, or missiles.

A full report will be on your desk upon return.

THE SENATOR QUOTED GEN. THOMAS POWER, STRATEGIC AIR COMMANDER, AS SAYING THAT ON ONE OCCASION "APPARENTLY AUTHENTIC INFORMATION HAD COME FROM OUR RADAR STATIONS IN THE OCEAN AND CORROBORATED BY OUR RADAR STATIONS ON THE COAST, OF A FLEET OF PLANES TRAVELING AT 2,000 MILES AN HOUR HEADED FOR THE INTERIOR OF THIS COUNTRY."

"THE QUESTION WAS: WHAT SHALL WE DO ABOUT IT?" FLANDERS SAID.

"WE (POWER) SAID WAIT AND THEY WAITED, AND (THE REPORTED PLANES) DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR AFTER THEY HAD PASSED THE COAST."

BUT WAS ONE OF THESE UFO'S, UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, WHICH WERE DUE TO THE SENSITIVENESS OF THE RADAR AND NOT TO ANY ACTUAL EXISTING OBJECT.

MEMORANDUM FOR MAJOR GENERAL WALSH

SUBJECT: Air Defense Radar Incident

1. I have reviewed the attached account of an Air Defense radar incident with great interest. I referred this report to my electronics officer who advised me that he is inclined to agree with the NORAD team that the most probable cause of this incident was equipment malfunction. However, he also stated that he is unable to suggest a specific malfunction that would result in an incident precisely as reported.

2. Considering factors such as deceleration times, lack of good correlation, etc., I am inclined to believe that the object reported, if it actually existed, is most probably not a weapon of enemy origin. Nevertheless, I believe that from your standpoint, this incident should not be closed. Some additional engineering opinion would be of value and I suggest that your electronics people as well as ARDC may be able to shed further light on the problem. In the meantime, you may want to consider asking ADC's assistance in having radar sites report similar types of incidents on a special effort basis for the next few months with the objective of determining whether this is in fact an isolated instance.

MEMORANDUM TO: Mr. Arcier, 4XL
THRU: Colonel Gilbert, 4B

SUBJECT: Evaluation of Air Defense Radar UFO Incident - Requested by General Walsh

1. Reference is made to Gen Walsh's request to Gen Watson re-garding full particulars on a long-duration, potentially hostile high-speed tracks (reportedly) originating near Martha's Vineyard, Mass., passing over Nantalo, New York, Cleveland, Ohio and pointed towards SAC Headquarters at Omaha, Nebraska. The incident resulted in an immediate alert by ADC and SAC.

2. Attached is a detailed report of the incident, properly plotted, carefully analysed and concluded. For purposes of contacting Gen Walsh and presenting the incident in brief form, the following are submitted:

a. Track was picked up originally by the radar unit at Montauk, New York at 1962 time, 20 September 1957. It was picked by Benton, Pa unit at 1918Z.

b. The radar units at Highlands, N.Y., N. Truro, Mass, Lockport, N.Y. and Claysburg, Pa. were alerted. However, these units could not make contact with the supposed target.

c. Two F-102 aircraft were scrambled from Kinross AFB (ADC) (Michigan) as well as two additional F-102's from Truax AFB (Wisconsin) as the target was bearing on a pre-plotted track in that direction. No contact made; nothing unusual found. The tracks faded at this point. (Significant to point out the last observed track was in the vicinity of Benton, N.Y. and not in the vicinity of SAC HQ as reported to ATIC.)
Weather conditions: overcast and rain.

d. NORAD set up a radar team to study this incident, including similar targets if they should appear.

e. On 25 September, the radar team noted a series of blips on the radarscope of the Montauk, N.Y. Station, the unit originally reporting the tracks. These were "quite similar". From 1800 to 2000 September. When the channel (frequency) was changed the blips disappeared. They re-appeared when the previous channel was tuned in.

f. A check of the Benton, Pa. Unit disclosed that there were two SAC aircraft in the area which dropped "streams of radar chaff" near the station on 20 September 57. It was also determined that the detection and characteristics of these targets were completely abnormal.

g. Other applicable units were checked.

3. Conclusions: In brief, the conclusions are as follows:

a. The information and data studied from all pertinent units appeared to be unrelated, and in fact contradictory to each other.

b. It is therefore impossible to draw any valid conclusions, although there appears no indication that the tracks were hostile or unknown aircraft or vehicles.

4. This report has not been channeled through the Electronics Division, because of the urgent request that all results be brought immediately to your attention. For subsequent transmission to AFCIN. This report, in the opinion of the undersigned, should be of value to personnel involved in analyzing radar UFOs. If will, therefore, be reproduced and forwarded to AFCIN-AEI for their possible guidance.

3. Benton established an initial plot on an unknown target north of the station at 1918Z. The track described a westerly course at a speed of about 920 knots. The target was tracked continuously until it faded at 1926Z. At 1924Z, 2 minutes prior to the fading of the unknown target, a new target appeared at a position northeast of the station at a speed of 1,200 knots. This target described a track that closely paralleled that of the first track and faded at 1932Z at a position northwest of the station.

4. These unknown tracks were passed to the 7631 ACWRON (Migrate) at Lockport AFS, N.Y. and to the 772d ACWRON AFS (Silvertone) at Claysburg AFS, Pennsylvania; however, these radars failed to establish a contact with the targets.

5. Four Divisions went to a state of Increased Readiness during the time period. The 20th CADD and the 31st CADD at 2008Z and the 30th CADD and 37th CADD at 1943Z.

6. No scramble action was taken by the 26th CADD due to the very high speed of the target. When the track first appeared on the CFECR plotting board at 1907Z, the 37th CADD was notified and at 1910Z two F-102 aircraft from Kinross were scrambled. The 37th then scrambled two additional F-102s from Truax. By this time, both tracks had faded.
