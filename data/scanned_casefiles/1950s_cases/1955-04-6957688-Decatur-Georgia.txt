COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

Due to the proximity of numerous airports in the area of the sighting
It is suggested in the report of unusual sightings of green (3) lights as re-
ported in the transcript that the conclusion that the observer's object was a
light from an aircraft, a reflection of light from an aircraft, clouds, balloons
(See pgs 2 and 3)

HOWARD G. VAUGHN
1st Lt., USAF
Officer in Charge

Comments of Approving Officer:

Concur to the opinion of a preparing officer that objects were possibly
caused by a reflection from a balloon.

DATE FLYER: MAY 1955
LOCATION: DECATUR, GEORGIA
INVESTIGATION BY: 4602ND ABSD, LANGLEY AFB
SIGHTING DATE: APR 1955
REPORT BY: J. C. GEORGE

On 11 Apr 1955, R. J. SCOTT, age 23, of Decatur, Georgia, reported that on the night of 8 Apr 1955 he observed a strange aerial object while driving on Clairemont Road toward Decatur. SCOTT stated that at about 11:45 p.m. he saw a bright light in the sky which was estimated to be about 1,000 feet in altitude and about 2 miles distant. SCOTT stated that the object appeared to be round or oval in shape and seemed to be glowing. SCOTT said that the object remained stationary for about 2 minutes and then moved rapidly to the northeast at a high rate of speed.

SCOTT's statement was investigated by A-2, Hq, 4602nd ABSD, Langley AFB, Va, on 6 Apr 1955.

Supplementary Investigative Reports

1. A check was made with the Weather Detachment, 14th Weather
Group, Dobbins AFB, Georgia with negative results.

2. A check with US Weather Station, Atlanta Airport, Atlanta, Georgia
revealed that a weather balloon had been released at approximately 1837/2Z00,
April 1955, one and a half hour prior to the sighting.

3. A phone call to Maxwell A2z Alabama weather station revealed that
a Rediosonde balloon ten (10) feet in diameter had been released from there
at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, and the wind conditions might place it in the vicinity
of the sighting at approximately 19000C/2Z, April 1955. Also on checking
Maxwell AFB Weather Officers indicated that the baloon would appear consider-
ably at a greater distance and that a carnal observer could spot it if it
reflected light.

4. The control tower, Atlanta Airport, Atlanta, Georgia advised that
there was considerable air traffic both civil or military in the area of the
sighting and that no unusual report or aerial objects had been recorded.

5. A check was made with Base Operations, Dobbins AFB, Georgia with
negative results.
