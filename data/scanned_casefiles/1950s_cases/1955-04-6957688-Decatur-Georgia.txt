COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

The first paragraph begins but is mostly illegible. I can make out a few words but not enough to confidently reproduce the full text.

There are two signatures on the document, but the names are not clearly legible.

The bottom of the document has some text, but it is too blurry and faded to accurately transcribe.

The document appears to be an official military form, likely related to a UFO or incident report, but significant portions of the text are not readable due to the poor image quality.
