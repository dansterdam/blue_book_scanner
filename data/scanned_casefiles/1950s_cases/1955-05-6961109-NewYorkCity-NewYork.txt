PART ONE

Date: 9 feb 60 
Case: 53 - 1003 - 43

I. SOURCE:
Age: 31
Occupation: Television Technician 
Education: Two years college
Qualifications: Antiaircraft Gunner, ETO 1943-45

II. THE ACCOUNT: The source stated that on 15 May 1953 at approximately 1500 Eastern Daylight Saving Time, he observed a round white object in the sky while working on a television antenna on the southwest corner of 30th Street and 7th Avenue in downtown Manhattan. The object appeared to be stationary and hovering at an estimated altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet. It was silhouetted against the sky. The source stated that after watching it for about 4 to 5 minutes, he secured his camera and took three pictures of the object, two of which he alleges were successful. He said the object then suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly to the north at great speed, disappearing from view in approximately 1 to 1 1/2 seconds. The source stated that he was convinced the object was not a conventional aircraft and that it displayed characteristics which he felt were not normal or known to him. He stated that as a former antiaircraft gunner, he was familiar with the appearance of various types of aircraft, and that this object was unlike any he had ever seen before.

III. DISPOSITION: The object viewed by the source could not be identified. The photos which he alleges were taken are not available for examination. The source is considered to be of questionable reliability.

2. While in the western position, the object was dark in color. As it progressed southeasterly, the brightest colors became visible. Suddenly the color turned reddish-green. It swayed brilliantly like the glimmer of an aircraft. There was apparently no sound recordable. The object departed rapidly into the distance. It was at an altitude of about 2500 feet and travelled at an estimated speed of several hundred miles per hour.

6. The object was observed for approximately 2-1/2 minutes, but did not appear to be an optical phenomenon. It did not think should attempt to include another report, because of its extreme velocity and are like the trajectory.

1. 30/25002 JUN 55: Investigator's statement: At 6:30 PM, on 30 June 1955, I was alerted at my office in New York City, N.Y. The sighting had been reported to the Filter Center by the Eastern Air Defense Command at Stewart AFB, Newburgh, N.Y.

I immediately went to the site of the sighting, arriving at 7:10 PM. The witnesses, two Air Force officers, stated that they had observed an unusual object in the sky. According to their statements, the object was first observed at approximately 6:30 PM, and was tracked by the radar at Stewart AFB from 6:30 to 7:00 PM. The object was described as circular in shape, metallic in appearance, and approximately the size of a B-29 aircraft. It was reported to have been moving at a very high rate of speed, and to have made abrupt changes in direction. The radar at Stewart AFB had obtained negative results for identification, but it did not indicate the presence of the object.

2. RADAR DATA: The 12th Weather Squadron of Stewart AFB, Newburgh, N.Y. furnished the following summary of weather conditions for 16/0002Z MAY 25: RADAR CONTACT LOST AT 25.000
FEET ALTITUDE DUE TO RAIN SHOWERS.

Interviewed in: New York City, N.Y.
Statement by: Capt. H.J. Anone, U.S.A.F. The witness stated that he and another officer were standing outside the control tower at Stewart AFB, Newburgh, N.Y. when they observed an unusual object in the sky. The object was circular in shape, metallic in appearance, and approximately the size of a B-29 aircraft. It was moving at a very high rate of speed and made abrupt changes in direction. The object was observed for approximately 30 minutes, from 6:30 to 7:00 PM on 30 June 1955.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER
1. The possibility that the balloon identified in PART THREE, par. 2, of this report has been intercepted at a point approximately seven miles northeast, there and one-half mile up, would appear to be acceptable. The tracking has been conducted continuously since the initial observation and the location of the balloon at the times indicated checks closely with the determined location of the sighting. Detailed observation of the balloon by the Ground Observation Corps, in addition to radar contact, plus the reported characteristic activities, make this theory the most plausible explanation. The sighting was reported as occurring between 2230 and 2300 hours. The balloon was observed by the GOC to be in the indicated position at that time. Intermittant contact, due to the failure of radar elements in the area, was experienced during the period, but the balloon was never lost from view after the initial sighting. Observations of the balloon's position and activities by the GOC are considered reliable and correlated with the reported sighting.
2. The source fixed the position of the original sighting at 270, observed altitude approximately 2,500 feet, and indicated a time of observation of approximately 2240 hours. Considering these factors in conjunction with the reported position of the balloon, there appears to be a reasonable correlation. The object was reportedly viewed for a period of about 15-20 minutes, disappearance being attributed to the fact that it passed behind some trees, toward the north. The reports do not support this claim. In negative, the object is opaque, with the same directional course indicated in the same direction, and the disappearance could not be attributed to the described obstacle. The object did not reappear.
3. Disregarding the slight blurring effect produced by camera movement, all indications show the image was that of a balloon. The image forms shown in negative 72 are not more than 300 feet from the camera lens. It is sharply defined and the only source of light appears to be the sun. The image element of the camera set at infinity. Objects at a distance greater than 500 feet should appear with relatively sharp focus, provided the focusing of the lens was properly adjusted. It is concluded that the image of the object was relatively minute, probably less than six inches across.
4. Considering the effect produced by the distortion of the human eye, when dealing with an object so distant, the hypothesis is accordingly discussed.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the object described in this report and the photographs taken are worthwhile for the following reasons:
a. The enclosed photographs were taken by the local U.S. Weather Bureau and Air Force weather station for analysis. It is the opinion of those familiar with the case that the photographs do show something significant.
b. The day (Sunday) of the sighting coupled with the fact that the area of sightings is highly industrial and crowded at that time indicates the probability of a large number of witnesses.
c. Commercial and Air Force photographers were contacted concerning the possibility of having taken ground photographs with the type camera used by the source. In all cases it was agreed that it would be possible by chance to accidentally obtain a picture in the 18 to 20 feet range.
2. Although the source is a "casual fan" and was particularly interested in publicity, seems to substantiate the possibility of a real event.
3. Although the object was given a rapid rate of speed by the source, he managed to snap ten pictures (of which only two were returned) in one and one-half minutes, which does not lend a rapid increment to the duration of the phenomenon.
4. This report and pictures are forwarded to ATIC for further analysis and evaluation.

The image appears to contain a photograph of a blurred and indistinct object, described in the text as a "sphere" that "if viewed soundlessly, became a blur and vanished from sight." The text discusses the phenomenon of "flying saucers" and how these objects are often unpredictable and difficult to capture in photographs.

It's the Flying Saucer Season Again: Sphere Is One of Those Things
TV Technician Takes Pictures
The flying saucer season is usually as unpredictable as the things themselves, but this year it opened with a bang. And the bang was centered in the Union Square area of New York City. 
A TV technician, whose name is not disclosed, was walking along the street when he saw the sphere in the sky. He quickly snapped several pictures of it, and according to the report, the sphere, if viewed soundlessly, became a blur and vanished from sight.
According to the description, the sphere was elliptical in shape and its surface appeared to be corrugated or striated. The technician said it was about the size of a basketball and seemed to be moving swiftly. When he gasped and cried out, the sphere disappeared. The technician's pictures, when developed, showed only a blurred image.
Obviously, if it was in fact a flying saucer, its angular structure and swift, silent movement would account for the blurred image on the film. Flying saucers have a habit of appearing and disappearing rapidly. And the Union Square area has been a familiar hunting ground for these mysterious objects.

American Ambassador Charles Bohlen said funds to India as a loan would go as low as $90 million. The article mentions former Korean war prisoners who have been freed from "political pressure" to return to North Korea and Red China, and they arrived in India to go to America. 43 former Korean war prisoners asked the Indian government to allow them to go to America instead of returning to North Korea or Red China.

This is a report on the incident which occurred on May 6, 1955, in New York City, New York. The report describes a sighting of an unidentified flying object. The details are as follows:

At approximately 9:20 PM on May 6, 1955, a citizen reported seeing an unusual object in the sky over New York City. The object was described as being cigar-shaped, silver in color, and moving at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for several minutes before it disappeared from view.

Police officers were dispatched to investigate the sighting, but were unable to locate the object. No other witnesses were found at the time.

The report concludes that the object observed was likely an unidentified flying object, as no known aircraft or other explanation could be determined based on the witness account and investigation. The case was subsequently included in Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's program for investigating UFO reports.

(TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT)
The witness was a 27-year-old male who was employed as an electrician. At approximately 8:00 PM on May 6, 1955, the witness was on his way home from work in New York City. As he was walking down the street, he observed an unusual object in the sky that caught his attention.

The object appeared to be circular in shape and was hovering in the air approximately 500 feet above the ground. The object was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and was a bright, metallic color. The witness observed the object for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The witness immediately reported the incident to the local police department. An investigation was conducted, but no further evidence or witnesses were found. The case was subsequently forwarded to Project Blue Book for further evaluation.
