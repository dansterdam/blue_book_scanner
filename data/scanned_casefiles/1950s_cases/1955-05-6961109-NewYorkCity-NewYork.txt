II. SUMMARY: 29/2000Z JUN 55, Det 3 was instructed in telephone conversation with Hq, 4602d AISS, to institute a follow-up investigation of a UFOB* sighting that occurred at [REDACTED] (GORGE HILL 6044) on 15/JUNE 55. Mr. [REDACTED], a resident of the address given above, was on the roof of the apartment house preparing to take pictures of Miss J. [REDACTED] with a camera he had rented for the occasion. While he adjusted the camera, he gasped and pointed at something in the western quadrant of the sky. It was a large, opaque, airborne object to the west on a bearing of 45°. The object hovered momentarily, then moved very rapidly to the north on a course. It remained in the original position with the same bearing motion and the process was repeated a second time. It then disappeared in the northern sky. When first sighted, the object was opaque, becoming almost translucent as it moved to the north. It gleamed in the sunlight as though metallic. At no time during the 13 minutes of sighting was there any sound or visible exhaust trail. He utilized the rented camera to take pictures of the object in flight.

II. RELIABILITY:  SOURCE was extremely cooperative, even profuse in answering questions and recounting the events surrounding his sighting. He had been somewhat disappointed that the Air Force had apparently abandoned further inquiry into the "flying Saucer" and expressed satisfaction that a renewed investigation was to be relaunched. He stated that as soon as the negatives of the "Sauces" were developed, he took them to the offices of LIFE magazine and to the New York Journal American. Both organizations declined to publish the sighting. The instant article in the New York World Telegram appeared to publish the pictures with an article, but Source stated that subsequent to publication of the articles, he received many requests from private citizens for these documents. He was currently filling these requests on a cost basis. In the course of conversation, Source mentioned that he had been interested in "Saucer Phenomena" for some time prior to the actual sighting. He is now participating more actively, attending "Saucer Club" meetings, etc.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. Sunday, 15 May at 1600 Eastern Daylight Saving Time, Source and companion, Miss _______, had gone to the roof of their residence - a four-story apartment building in downtown Manhattan - to take some snapshots.

2. Source was using a rented English reflex sighting box camera. The camera had two (2) f. settings (apertures); f11 and f18. Two speed settings were available; 1/25th second and 1/75th second. Focus determined by visually setting ring and adjusting distance setting. No range finder accompanied or was attached to the camera.

3. Source faced south-east, preparing to take Miss _______ picture. While adjusting the camera, Miss _______ gazed and accidentally pointed in the direction of the northwest quadrant of the sky. Source turned and saw an object he estimated to be at an altitude of 7,000 feet. The object was dark in color, cylindrical in shape. Azimuth and altitude of the object when first observed were 270° and 45° respectively. The object moved to the north at great speed, describing an arc in 1/1a flight-path (See incl). coming to rest momentarily in the north at 45° elevation. It then remained stationary in position (Point A). Almost immediately, the object repeated the cycle (Point B) and upon reaching its northern position, hovered momentarily and rose vertically in the northwest quadrant (Point C).

4. Upon sighting the object, the Source immediately set the camera at f18 and shutter speed of 1/75th second. Focus was set at infinity. He reasonably shot this object while it was visible. Although he exposed ten (10) frames, only five (5) ...

were returned; the druggist explained th t the remainder were no good.

5. While in the western position, the object was dark in color. As it progressed northward, it became brighter and became almost transparent. It gleamed brightly in the sun, like the aluminum skin of an aircraft. There was no sound accompanying the object nor did it display an exhaust pattern or condensation trail. The object's size was estimated to be two hundred feet or a quarter size at arm's length. Distance appeared to be "several miles."

6. The object was observed for approximately one and one-half minutes before disappearing. The sky was clear in bright sunlight and the temperature was relatively high.

7. Source was emphatic in belief that the object was physically real and not an optical phenomenon. He did not think it could possibly have been a balloon because of its extreme velocity and arc-like trajectory.

II. RELIABILITY: Source apparently occupies same apartment as Mr. [Blacked out]. She was present during the interview with this latter. She from her silent during the conversation and did not volunteer any additional, original information on the sighting. Although she appeared to be calm and confident, Source conferred with Mr. [Blacked out] before venturing to answer questions posed by the investigating officer. She indicated reluctance to discuss her occupation, etc., and efforts in this direction were not pressed. Her description of the sighting coincided identically with that of Mr. [Blacked out].

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. 30/15002 JUN 55, Investigators visited the Office of Specl. Investigations, District JA at 111 East 16th St., New York City, N.Y. The all-thing had been reported to this office by Source - Mr. [redacted], several days after it occurred. Mr. Frank Auld - Special Agent - was detailed to make an investigation and accordingly collected preliminary information on the sighting from Source. A file, summarizing the information, was prepared by Mr. Auld and was retained at District #2. No preliminary report, as provided by AFR 200-2, was transmitted. CSI had obtained the negatives for examination, but failed to establish any significant data. The file, prepared by OSI was continued by the Investigators prior to interviewing the Source. No deviations were noted. No attempt at identification or the sighting was made in the OSI report.

2. COC, EADF, Stewart AFB, Newburgh, N.Y. indicated that there was no unusual air activity in the Manhattan area at the time of the sighting. Specifically, no unusual activity was noted with regard to balloons or dirigibles with a negative reply. However, one incident of note had occurred in the metropolitan area on the same afternoon at an earlier hour. At 15/1532 MAY 55 the 26th Air Division reported a sighting that had occurred at 15/15302 MAY 55 at position HJFL 1150. The object - like a red watermelon, was observed by Maj Heck - a COC Observer of 119 West Sanford Boulevard, Mount Vernon, N.Y. Altitude was given at 1,000 feet to the south of Observer's position. This object was positively identified as a balloon by Lt. Curry, Intelligence Watch Officer of 26th Air Division.

3. The 12th Weather Squadron of Stewart AFB, Newburgh, N.Y. furnished the following summary of weather conditions for 15/2000x MAY 55: Locations - 20302 reported scattered clouds at 2,500; visibility 15 miles; temperature - 72°F; dew point - 36°F; wind from the north at 6 MPH; barometer - 30.14. Floyd Bennett reported clear sky; temperature 70°F; dew point 43°F; wind from the east at 2 MPH. At 2130Z Lakehurst reported clear sky; temperature - 67°F; dew point 45°F; wind from the southeast at 10MPH. Mitchell AFB 21002 winds aloft, reported as follows:

[Table of wind speeds and altitudes omitted]

4. Interviewed Mr. [redacted] of "Flying Saucer News" at 1597 3rd Avenue, N.Y. City, N.Y. [redacted] personally know Mr. [redacted], but added that he would publish an article on the sighting in his magazine. Mr. [redacted] was certain that the sighting was an authentic "Flying Saucer", probably from a neighboring planet.

5. Submitted the negatives of the sighting furnished by Mr. [redacted] to Photo Lab, Stewart AFB, for inspection and evaluation. The camera used was [redacted].

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER

1. The possibility that the balloon identified in PART THREE par 2 of this report accounts for the sighting is extremely remote. Position of the balloon was fixed at a point approximately seven miles northwest, three and one-half hours earlier than the sighting in question. The average wind between 1,000 feet and 10,000 feet was reported at 325° at 15 knots. The balloon would logically have traveled well beyond the metropolitan area in the specified time interval. At a standard rate of ascent, moreover, the balloon would have disintegrated long before 2000Z. The sighting has been described as varying in color from dark to flaming aluminum. The balloon is described as red. Time of the sighting was one hour prior to scheduled radiosonds releases (210CZ); therefore, it is considered unlikely that activities of other weather stations is significant. The peculiar trajectory pattern ascribed to the sighting cannot be rationalized with that of the balloon.

2. No significant radar plots can be established for the times of the sightings. Dirigible activity has been reported in the negative.

3. Celestial phenomena are considered unrelated to the sighting. The sun, in relation to the observer's position, was at true azimuth 254.5°, observed altitude -44.5 degrees. Mars, Mercury and the bright star Aldebaran had already transited the observer's meridian and were too close to the sun for observation. Venus lay to the west but was very low on the horizon.

4. Source's estimate of size, distance and altitude of sighting are equivocal. Inspection of negative #3 reveals that the length of the object is almost 1/2 times greater than the TV tower atop the Empire State Building. The tower is known to be 200 feet long. The Source stated that the object was several miles distant. At a range of three miles, the object would measure about 750 feet across. It is inconceivable that an object of such size, flying over a city inhabited by 8,000,000 people, would be seen by only two individuals.

5. The Source fixed the position of the original sighting at 270°, observed altitude -45°. The sun's position is calculated at 254.5°, observed altitude 44.5°. In a clear sky, within 15° of the sun, the object would hardly be discernible, possibly invisible. Although the object was described as opaque in the west, becoming brighter as it progressed to the north, the negatives do not support this claim. In negative #2, the object is opaque, with maximum delineation; in negative #3, oriented in the same direction, the object appears as an amorphous, colorless blob.

6. Disregarding the slight blurring effect produced by camera movement, all the buildings shown in the negatives are in focus. The water tower shows in negative #2 as not more than 300 feet from the camera lens. It is sharply outlined. The object is never in focus, nor can its shape be determined with any degree of certainty. The Source states that the exposure was made with the range element of the camera set at infinity. Objects at a distance greater than 15 feet to 20 feet should be in focus. Therefore, it may be postulated that the object was less than 15 feet from the camera lens. Consequently, the object was relatively minute, probably less than six inches across.

7. Optically, such an effect might be produced by the hysterotic effect of lens accommodation of the human eyes, when focusing from a proximate to a distant object. Both Source first observed the object visually without any optical instrument. The camera, however, is not subject to such an effect. Focus being permanently fixed, this hypothesis is accordingly discarded.

8. In view of the discrepancies noted above and on the basis of those equivocal items which cannot be resolved, it is considered that the "object" and the accompanying pictures were conscientiously manufactured. Considering the questionable reliability of the Source, his attempts at exploitation and affiliation with "Flying Saucer" material, it is herewith submitted that the "object" described in this report and the photographs of it are fraudulent.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the object described in this report and the photographs of it are fraudulent for the following reasons:

    a. The enclosed photographs were taken to the local U.S. Weather Bureau and Air Force Weather Station for analysis. It is the opinion of the above agencies that the object cannot be attributed to cloud activity.

    b. The day (Sunday) of the sighting coupled with the fact that the area of sighting is highly unionized would tend to eliminate the possibility of smoke or steam. Also, there is no railroad activity in the area.

    c. Commercial and Air Force photographers were contacted concerning the possibility of manufacturing the enclosed photographs with the type camera used by the source. In all cases it was agreed that it would be possible by placing a small object within 15 to 20 feet of the camera lens and making the range element at infinity, thereby giving a blurred effect to any object within the 15 to 20 foot range.

    d. The fact that the source is a "saucer fan" and was particularly interested in publicity seems to substantiate the possibility of a hoax.

    e. Although the object was given a rapid rate of speed by the source, he managed to snap ten pictures (of which only five were returned) in one and one-half minutes, which do not, by position, give a rapid movement to the object.

2. This report and pictures are forwarded to ATIC for further analysis and evaluation.

It's the Flying Saucer Season Again;
Sphere Is One of Those Things
TV Technician
Takes Pictures

The flying saucer season, usually as unpredictable as an oboe player's mood, has arrived in New York at last.

So quietly, indeed, at mid-the season arrives—Sunday, May 15, at 4 p.m. if you're interested in making a note of the time—that it might well have gone unnoticed had it not been for the alert technician and an attractive French girl, who as it turned out—well, there's no telling what happened.

What happened was simply this: Mr. Siegmond rental an English reflex-type camera for $1.25 on May 15 and bought some film. He took some pictures of the attractive French girl, whose name is Jeannine Boullier and who works for the French Government Tourist Film Developed.

Taking Pictures on Roof

On the Sunday afternoon when the flying saucer season opened, they were in Mr. Siegmond's apartment at 7 W. 15th st., when he suddenly said the only decent place to take pictures was on the roof. Up they went. Mr. Siegmond began taking pictures of Miss Boullier, she clicking, she smiling, when she gasped and cried out, at the same time pointing.

There in the skies above the Union Square neighborhood, with its roots and angular structures of the Union Square neighborhood was a spherical object wheeling soundlessly, became a blur and vanished. . . it wheeled soundlessly, became a blur and vanished.
