                                                                Sightings

Upper air research balloon released from Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 9 October 1952, was lost 25 miles west of Toronto but was travelling in an easterly direction at 25 mph.

2230Z 9 Oct - 25 miles west of Toronto
0300Z 10 Oct - first sighted at Presque Isle
1970

If the balloon and the object are one in the same, it took the balloon 19.5 hrs to cover the 600 air miles from Toronto to Presque Isle. A check on this can be made since the wind speed at Toronto was 25 mph and taking the speed of the object at Presque Isle which was 27 mph, multiplying 26 mph by 19.5 hrs:

19.5
26
1170
5790 or the distance covered of 507 miles.

The discrepancy of the 93 miles necessary to put the balloon in the immediate vicinity of Presque Isle and Limestone could be due to altitude fluctuations in the balloon's flight. It is quite possible that the average speed was over 26 mph, as the balloon alternately gained and lost altitude and entered different air streams of higher speeds. At 31 mph, for example, the distance covered would be 604.5 miles.

10 October 1952                                                   Presque Isle AFB, Maine

Description of Incident

Observers at Presque Isle AFB observed a circular orange object with four green lights nearby. The object was observed from 2200 EST 10 Oct 52 until 0200 EST on 11 Oct 52, a period of five hours. The object or lights were observed by observers at the weather station of Presque Isle AFB, Maine. Theodolite readings were made from Presque Isle AFB and Limestone AFB, Maine.

The readings are as follows:

Presque Isle AFB
Time        Elevation    Azimuth
11/0550z   59.0°        156.2°
11/0551z   59.2°        156.5
11/0552z   59.2°        157.0
11/0553z   59.2°        157.7
11/0554z   59.3°        158.1

Limestone AFB
11/0553z   56.0°        169.5

Discussion

Since the times of the reading are not coincident, one azimuth angle will have to be extrapulated to make the times coincident. The bearing at Presque Isle changed 1.9° in 5 minutes or 0.38°/min. Assuming the light or object was moving at a constant velocity and course, the azimuth angle can be moved back time-wise from 055Uz to 0553z or 12 minutes, 12 x 0.38° = 4.56°, so at 0553z the azimuth from Presque Isle would be 151.64°. Using this and azimuth of 169.5° from Limestone, the earth point directly under the object can be plotted. The

UNCLASSIFIED


- page 10 -

UNCLASSIFIED

distance (d) from Presque Isle is 36 statute miles.

The elevation from Presque Isle changed 0.3° in 5 minutes or 0.06°/min. In 12 minutes, the change would be 0.72°. Again assuming constant course and altitude the elevation at 05382 would be 58.3°. The altitude would then be:

h = d tan 58.3°
= d tan 1.619
= 36 (1.619)
h = 58 miles = 306,240'

This neglects the curvature of the earth. This correction is d²/2r where R is the radius of the earth in miles. This term can be neglected.

The angular velocity from Presque Isle was 1.90/5 min or 22.8°/hour or 0.3985 radius/hour.

S = slant range
V = SW
W = angular velocity in radius
V = velocity

S = d/cos - 36 = 66 miles
V = S (0.3985) = 66 (0.3985)
V = 27.2 mph

One possible solution is that the theodolite readings are not accurate. Since Presque Isle made five readings and all were consistent, it can safely be assumed that they are accurate, and, however, indicates the light was at a high angle of elevation south of the base. The readings from Limestone can also be considered accurate since the light they observed was in the same general area.

The speed of the object, 27 mph, indicates it could be a balloon, but no balloon flies at +300,000'. A 66 2/3% error would be needed in the theodolite readings to get down to 100,000', the maximum limit for balloons.

The speed and altitude eliminates the possibility of aircraft.

The elevation, 60°, eliminates the possibility of a mirage or any phenomena based on the reflection or refraction of light from an inversion layer.

One possibility is that the object was a star or planet. The azimuth angles from the two stations should have been more nearly the same if this is true, but a calibration error could cause the difference. The key is probably the angular velocity.

Conclusions

No conclusions can be made until the angular velocity can be checked against that of astronomical bodies.

One incident that particularly engaged the attention of the panel, and would probably have become a famous classic except that Air Force investigators had, [...] a strict secret, was the sighting at Presque Isle Air Force Base in northern Maine. On October 10, 1952, at about 10 P.M. E.S.T., a group of weather observers had noticed a bright-orange object hovering low on the eastern horizon and had set up a theodolite to measure its altitude and bearing. As the glowing unknown slowly rose higher above the horizon and seemed to come closer, it appeared through the telescope of the theodolite as a circular disk accompanied by four flickering green lights, two on each side. Alarmed by this spectacular phenomenon, the observers called the Air Force Base at Limestone, some twenty miles north and east, to ask whether the object was visible there. It was. Setting up a theodolite, the Limestone observers measured the height and bearing, and both groups of observers sent the recorded data to ATIC.

Here was the kind of situation the investigators had been hoping for: simultaneous observations of a single object, made from two different stations a known distance apart. Calculations based on the

altitude and bearings reported by the two stations yielded fantastic
results. In a plot of the data (shown schematically in Figure 12a)

the prolonged lines intersected, indicating a group of unknowns
hovering some 100 miles above the earth, more than 50 miles off
the Maine coast, of tremendous size and moving at high speed.
Concluding that the objects must have come from outer space, or
were possibly a new type of orbiting vehicle of Russian origin, the
Air Force had promptly clamped down the security lid. When
ATIC's science consultant, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, looked at the data,
he just as promptly disagreed with these ideas and clearly identified the unknowns as the planet Jupiter, which had risen at 6:09
p.m. E.S.T., and at 10:00 the brightest object in the eastern sky. The
believers in the extraterrestrial theory were then in the majority
at ATIC, however. They had refused to accept the identification,
and submitted the Presque Isle sighting to the panel as a prize
example of UFO surveillance.

The panel members quickly disposed of the case. The measurements reported from Presque Isle obviously pointed directly to the
planet Jupiter, not a mere 100 but millions of miles beyond the
earth. If a constant correction was applied to the bearings from
Limestone, they also agreed with Jupiter's position. Careless use
of the decolite had produced an error in the data. To measure
the angle of an object above the horizon, the observer has only to
make sure that the decolite is level, but to measure the bearing
he must align it with true north, a direction that cannot be determined by guesswork. The Limestone observers had made a mistake
in determining true north and had thus obtained a wrong bearing
for the unknown. When the corrected data were plotted (shown
schematically in Figure 12b) the prolonged lines were parallel, and
both pointed squarely to the planet Jupiter at infinity.

The orange light was unquestionably Jupiter, and the accompanying green lights were its four bright satellites twinkling through the layers of the earth's atmosphere. Amazed that this uncomplicated case, already explained by Dr. Hynek, should have been offered as evidence for the extraterrestrial origin of UFOs, the panel extended its investigation to the original observers at Presque Isle. The witnesses there were bewildered by the inquiry; they had checked their object's position in a appeared again, in the night of Oct. 11, they said, and had then identified it as the planet Jupiter, but they had not thought it necessary to notify the Air Force!

Possible Astronomical Analysis of the Presque Isle Sighting

This sighting of an U.F.O. was submitted to Dr. Hugh Hynell of Ohio State University (Chm. of the Astronomy Dept.) for his analysis. He hypothesized that the object sighted was most probably a celestial body (i.e. planet). There were several factors which influenced this decision, the major one that the object was sighted at a ± 30° arc off by the two observing theodolite positions at Presque Isle and Limestone, Me.

Mr. Hynell's opinion is as follows: The difference between this altitude as observed from the ground is very little in comparison with experimental perfection. Therefore, a planet moving thousands of light years (as far as infinity, on him as the theodolite observers are concerned), could very well have appeared to be at a fixed altitude of 300,000 ft.

Mr. Hynell is in the process of submitting a written report to ATIC, ATIC to give some limits to support this conclusion.

To support this explanation is the amount of time the object was observed - 5 hrs from 2200 EST to 0300 EST. This long for an UFO observation, noting the behavior, would account for the body.

1. Call Dr. Hynek. Is there any specific poop he wants?

2. Get questionnaires filled out by all people who observed object. I think questionnaires were sent but take a supply along.

3. Get poop on backgrounds - are the people experienced at reading theodolites.

4. Get story of circumstances, who saw what first, who called who, etc.

5. Description of what object did for the five hour period. (Should be in questionnaire.)

6. What were the arrangement of lights and what were comparative size?

7. Has it been seen since or was it ever seen before?

8. Were there any radar pick-ups? No

9. Did all people see the same thing?

10. Any opinions as to what it was.

11. Calibrating theodolites at Presque Isle and Limestone.
    a. Pick out a known celestial body in the general area of where the object was seen.
    b. Get the exact time by getting a time tick if necessary.
    c. Take ten theodolite readings at two minute intervals noting exact time, elevation and bearing. Be sure you find out which body you are shooting.

12. Find out if readings we got are true or magnetic. If they should be magnetic, get variation for the area.

13. It would probably be a good idea to talk to each observer alone, especially as to the description of the object.

14. Leave a couples dozen questionnaires at both places. Also take a few radar questionnaires if they are finished.

INFO:
The object was observed at Presque Isle for five hours from 2300 ET 10 Oct 52 until 0200 EST 11 Oct 52 and was described as a "circular, orange object with four green lights nearby". Our analysis of the readings was accomplished by extrapolating one azimuth angle from Presque Isle to make the time of reading coincide. By so doing the object seems to have been traveling at 27 mph and flying at an altitude of + 500,000, extremely high for even an upper air research balloon.

However, the fact that your balloon was on an easterly track at Toronto and was headed in the general direction of Maine, compared to the object's description and carry with the wind, gives us the impression that the unknown probably was your balloon. The altitude discrepancy may be a mistake in reading the theodolite, although it would require a large margin of error.

Project Blue Book would appreciate knowing your further opinions or comments.
