The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a typed document describing an upper air research balloon released from Minneapolis, Minnesota on 9 October 1952. The document discusses the balloon's location, speed, and the potential reasons for the discrepancy between the reported distance and the actual distance covered by the balloon. The text of the document is as follows:

10 October 1952  
Presque Isle Theodolite Signings  

Upper air research balloon released from Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 9 Oct- ober 1952, was lost 25 miles west of Toronto but was traveling in an easterly direction at 25 mph.

22302 9 Oct - 25 miles west of Toronto 
03032 10 Oct - first sighted at Presque Isle 1950

If the balloon and the object are one in the same, it took the balloon 19.5 hrs to cover the 600 air miles from Toronto to Presque Isle. A check on this can be made since the wind speed at Toronto was 25 mph and taking the speed of the object at Presque Isle which was 27 mph, by multiplying 26 mph by 19.5 hrs:

19.5
26
507 (or the distance covered of 507 miles).

The discrepancy of the 93 miles necessary to put the balloon in the imme- diate vicinity of Presque Isle and Limestone could be due to altitude fluctua- tions in the balloon's flight.  It is quite possible that the average speed was over 26 mph, as the balloon alternately gained and lost altitude and entered different air streams of higher speeds.  At 31 mph, for example, the distance covered would be 604.5 miles.

Description of Incident

Observers at Presque Isle AFB observed a circular orange object with four green lights nearby. The object was observed from 2700 EST 10 Oct 52 until 0300 EST on 11 Oct 52, a period of five hours. The object or lights were observed by observers at the weather station of Presque Isle AFB, Maine. Theodolite readings were made from Presque Isle AFB and Limestone AFB, Maine.

The readings are as follows:

Presque Isle AFB
Time     Elevation  Azimuth
11/0550Z  59.0°      156.2°
11/0551Z  59.2°      156.5°
11/0552Z  59.2°      157.0°
11/0553Z  59.2°      157.7° 
11/0554Z  59.3°      158.1°

Limestone AFB
11/0553Z  58.0°      169.5°

Discussion
Since the times of the reading are not coincident, one azimuth angle will have to be extrapolated to make the times coincident. The bearing at Presque Isle changed 1.9° in 5 minutes or 0.38°/min. Assuming the light or object was moving at a constant velocity and course, the azimuth angle can be moved back time-wise from 0550Z to 0538Z or 12 minutes, 12 x 0.38° = 4.56°, so at 0538Z the azimuth from Presque Isle would be 157.4°. Using this and azimuth of 169.5° from Limestone, the search point directly under the object can be plotted.

UNCLASSIFIED

- page 10 -

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned document containing text.

UNCLASSIFIED
distance (d) from Presque Isle is 36 statute miles.
The elevation from Presque Isle changed 0.3° in 5 minutes or 0.06°/min. In 12 minutes, the change would be 0.72°. Again assuming constant course and attitude the elevation at 05382 would be 54.3°. The altitude would then be:
h = d tan 54.3°
= d tan 1.609
= 36 (1.619) 
h = 58 miles = 306,210'
This neglects the curvature of the earth. This correction is 2/3r where R is the radius of the earth in miles. This term can be neglected.
The angular velocity from Presque Isle was 1.90/5 min or 22.8°/hour or 0.3955 radians/hour.
S = slant range
V = sky 
W = angular velocity in radius
V = velocity
S = 63 - (0.3955)(63) = 63 miles
V = S (0.3955) = 63 (0.3955)
V = 27.2 mph 
One possible solution is that the theodolite readings are not accurate. Since Presque Isle made five readings and all were consistent, it can safely be assumed that they are accurate, and, however, indicate the light was at a high angle of elevation south of the base. The readings from Limestone can also be considered accurate since the light they observed was in the same general area.
The speed of the object, 27 mph, indicates it could be a balloon, but no balloon flies at 4,500,000'. A 6% 2/3% error would be needed in the theodolite readings to get down to 100,000', the maximum limit for balloons.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document discussing the possibility of aircraft and various phenomena based on the speed and altitude of an object.

The text in the document reads:

UNCLASSIFIED
The speed and altitude eliminates the possibility of aircraft.
The elevation, 60°, eliminates the possibility of a mirage or any phenomena based on the reflection or refraction of light from an inversion layer.
One possibility is that the object was a star or planet. The azimuth angle from two stations should have been more nearly the same if this is true, but a calibration error could cause the difference. The key is probably the angular velocity.

Conclusions
No conclusions can be made until the angular velocity can be checked against that of astronomical bodies.

One incident that particularly engaged the attention of the panel, and would probably have become a famous classic except that Air Force investigators had it as a strike secret, was the sighting at Presque Isle Air Force Base in northern Maine. On October 15, 1952, at about 10:15 p.m., E.S.T. a group of weather observers saw the early horizon and had set up a theodolite to measure its altitude and bearing. As the glow-ing sub-known slowly rose higher above the horizon and seemed to become closer, it appeared through the telescope of the theodolite as a strange disk accompanied by four flickering green lights, two on each side. Alarmed by this spectacular phenomenon, the observers called the Air Force Base at Limestone, some twenty miles north and east, to ask whether the object was visible there. It was. Setting up a theodolite, the Limestone observers confirmed the Presque Isle observers' account and both groups of observers saw the strange object for nearly an hour. Here was the kind of situation the investigators had been hoping for: simultaneous observations of a single object, made from two different stations a known distance apart. Calculations based on the observations showed that the object was about twenty-five miles from each station and was estimated to be approximately 300 feet in diameter.

The image contains a schematic diagram showing the "world of flying saucers" based on attitudes and bearings reported by two stations. The diagram includes labels such as "PRESQUE ISLE", "LIMESTONE", "ERRONEOUS", "JUPITER", and arrows indicating the directions of the flying objects. There is no photograph present in this image, only the schematic diagram.

Figure 1.a.: The Presque Isle sighting from two stations. Upon the erroneous identification of the object seen as a strategic reconnaissance balloon by the two nations, ATIC was called upon to investigate the sighting. They believed, from the prolonged lines intersected, indicating a group of unknown hovering some 150 miles above the earth, more than 300 miles off the Maine coast, of tremendous size and moving at high speed. Concluding that the object could have come from space, or may be of Russian origin, or that the Air Force had promptly clamped down the security lid. When some science consultants, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, looked at the data, he found the unknown to be the planet Jupiter, which had risen somewhat higher in the eastern sky. The believers in the extraterrestrial theory were then in the majority at ATIC, eventhough they had refused to accept the obvious, and the sighting had no claim to be passed as a prime example of UFO surveillance.
The noted French astronomer carefully disposed of the case. The measured range, 250 miles, was consistent with the planet Jupiter, not a mere 300 feet but millions of miles beyond the earth. If a constant correction was applied to the bearings from Presque Isle to Jupiter, the discrepancies disappeared. To measure the distance, the observer had only to make sure that the theodolite was level, but to measure the bearing he must align with the true north, and he had thus obtained a wrong bearing, schematically in Fig. 1.a. It showed that both pointing squares toward the planet Jupiter at infinity.

Regarding the text content of the document:

PRESSURE ISLE SIGHTING FROM TWO STATIONS
This was a case investigated by the Air Force as part of Project Blue Book. The document describes an incident where a group of unknown objects were observed moving rapidly along the Maine coast at high speed. The objects were detected from two stations and the lines of sight intersected, indicating a group of unknown objects. The document provides details about the sighting, including the speed and apparent size of the objects. It also mentions speculation about the objects potentially being related to extraterrestrial activity, though the investigators remained uncertain about the true nature of the phenomenon observed.

POSSIBLE ATMOSPHERIC ANALYSIS OF THE PRESSURE ISLE SIGHTING

The sighting of an U.F.O. over the little State University campus at the Tarzain of Houlton for his analysis. The object sighted is reported to have been observed to be a brilliant light source which appeared and disappeared with a pulsating motion. There was no noise associated with the sighting. The observer, who is a reliable witness, states that the object appeared larger than a star but smaller than the planet Venus. The size is estimated to have been about 3 to 5 inches in diameter when viewed at arm's length.

Dr. Hopkins' comments on the case are as follows: The difference between "his altitude" on observed flying from the ground is very little in comparison with the apparent size. The focus of a planet minding themselves of light years: only a planet of many thousands of miles in diameter. The object was located at an extremely high altitude and distance to qualify it as a planet or meteor. It could not have been a jet airplane or helicopter as there was no sound. The silence favors the conclusion that this was some form of balloon or dirigible-type of craft, but there is no report of any known balloons or airships in the area at the time.

Mr. Higgins is in the process of submitting a written report.

What was the amount of time the object was observed? This information is not given. But it is the survival of those who have observed these sightings at various times and places that the recorded evidence of unusual aerial activity is gathered to establish what may be termed the "hard core" of the U.F.O. problem which cannot be brushed aside as fantasy or products of overwrought imaginations.

Here is the text from the document:

1. Can Dr. Hynek. Is there any specific poop he wants?
2. Get questionnaires filled out by all people who observed objects. I think Questionnaires were sent but talk is support.
3. Get poop on backgrounds - are the people experienced at reading theodolites.
4. Get story of circumstances, who saw what first, who called who, etc. 
5. Description of what object did for the five hour period. (Should be in questionnaires.)
6. What were the arrangement of lights and what were comparative size?
7. Has it been seen since or was it ever seen before?
8. Were there any radar pick-ups? N/o
9. Did all people see the same thing?
10. Any opinions as to what it was.
11. Calibrating theodolites at Presque Isle and Limestone.
a. Pick out a known celestial body in the general area or where the object was seen.
b. Get the exact time by getting a time tick if necessary.
c. Take ten theodolite readings at two minute intervals noting exact time, elevation and bearing. Be sure to which body you are shooting.
12. Find out if readings we got are true or magnetic. If they should be magnetic set variation for this area.
13. It would probably be a good idea to talk to each observer along, especially as to the description of the object.
14. Leave a couple dozen questionnaires at both places. Also take a few radar questionnaires if they are finished.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a Joint Messageform from the Project Blue Book documentation. 

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

The object was observed at Prague Isle for five hours from 2200 ST 10 Oct. 52 until 0300 EST 11 Oct. 52 and was described as a "circular, orange object with four green lights nearby". Our analysis of the readings was accomplished by extrapolating the existence of Prague Isle to make the flying object coincidate. By so doing the object seems to have been traveling at 27 mph and flying at an altitude of + 500,000', extremely high for even an upper air research balloon.

However, the fact that your balloon was on an easterly track at Toronto and was handled in the general direction of Maine, compared to the object's description and carry with the wind, gives us the impression that the unknown probably was your balloon. The estimate discrepancy may be a mistake in reading the theodolite although it would require a large margin of error.

Project Blue Book would appreciate knowing your further opinions or comments.
