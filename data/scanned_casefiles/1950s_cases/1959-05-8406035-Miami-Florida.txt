Report of a UFO sent to be from a former student.
3425 Prow. Ave., Miami 14, 1959.

At 11:30 EST on May 17 I was walking back to my apartment
in Coconut Grove, a southeast section of Miami. I was looking
toward the eastern direction in the sky. At this time I saw
something that was quite unusual. It was visible for about
10 to 15 seconds and I would estimate it went 2 1/2 to 4 miles
in that time. It was round, somewhat like a cloud, somewhat
36 ft. in diameter. It was a dull white color, to some intensity
brighter than a cloud. It moved much like a beacon
on a cloud, but there was no cloud. The sky, as far as I was
aware, was of light handing to it.

Dear Mr.

Your recent reported sighting of an unidentified flying object contained insufficient data to allow a valid conclusion by the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

Therefore, I am inclosing the USAF Technical Information Sheet which you should fill out and forward direct to the Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Upon completion of their evaluation, I will forward their conclusions to you.

Sincerely,
