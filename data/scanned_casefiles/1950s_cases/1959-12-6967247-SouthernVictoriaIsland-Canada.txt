Unidentified radar track. Speed between 40 & 60 kts.

11. COMMENTS
Based on winds aloft, track movement & track groundspeed, the UFO could possibly be a balloon; however, lack of info makes thorough analysis impossible. Also the anomalous propagation in the area could be the cause as could the effects of permanent echo on a temperature inversion. Case listed as insufficient data.

Memo, AFCIN-4B4g, 28 Dec 59, Request for Evaluation
1st Ind (AFCIN-4B1a/Capt. Keriakov/jc/7420l)                    21 Jan 60

TO:    AFCIN-4B4g

1.    An analysis of the attached UFO message reveals the following
possibilities:

    a.    The reported anomalous propagation in the area could possibly
    be a. responsible for the unidentified radar pick up, particularly if a
    severe temperature inversion existed and permanent echoes on the radar
    were predominant.

    b.    Based on the winds aloft, track movement and track groundspeed,
    the UFO could possibly be a balloon.

2.    The lack of information on this UFO makes a more detailed and thorough
analysis impossible.
