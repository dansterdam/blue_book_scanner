There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record card, containing detailed information about an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred on December 29, 1959 on Southern Victoria Island, Canada.

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 29 Dec 59
2. LOCATION: Southern Victoria Island, Canada
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 15/0515Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. PHOTOS: None
6. SOURCE: Ground-Radar
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 25 min
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
9. COURSE: Erratic
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Unidentified circular track. Speeed between 40 & 50 kts.
11. COMMENTS: Noted on winds aloft, track movement & track groundspeed, the UFO could possibly be a balloon, however, lack of identification data precludes definitive analysis. Also the anomalous propagation in the area could be the cause as would the temperature inversion. Case listed as insufficient data.

The text in the document discusses a message or relay received from a military commander and mentions "PARA", likely referring to a paragraph or section of the message.

Memo, AFCIN-HHEG, 26 Dec 59, Request for Evaluation
1st Ind (AFCIN-HRLP/Capt. Koriakon/js/12201) 21 Jan 60
TO: AFCIN-HHEG

1. An analysis of the attached UFO message reveals the following:

a. The reported anomalous propagation in the area could possibly be re-escapable to the unidentified radar return, particularly if a severe temperature inversion existed and permanent echoes on the radar were a contributing factor.  

b. Based on the winds aloft, track movement and track groundspeed, the UFO could possibly be a balloon.

2. The lack of information on this UFO makes a more detailed and thorough analysis impossible.
