This replies to your letter of November 21, 1967. We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that a witness report has been made as soon as possible. This enables Air Force analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation.

Dear Sir:

In case this is of interest I like to report that about June 1950 my wife and I were travelling north from Denver Colorado at about 4:30 AM near Forth Collins I sighted an object that for all intent and purpose I thought to be a shooting star. However, it disappeared below the horizon and shot back out at about the same angle I came down and disappeared as indicated in the following sketch.

If it had not bounced back out I would have thought it merely to be a shooting star and probably would not even have remembered it. When it bounced back out my wife also saw it. As credentials I like to state that I am a Civil Engineer and have done a good deal of research work. The speed of the object is best described by the fact that I thought it to be a shooting star. For A meteor to bounce off the atmosphere I understand to be impossible. Would appreciate your opinion as to the possible connection with unidentified flying objects. If more accurate dates are of value I think they can be obtained. At the time I reported it to the Denver Post but they made no response to it.

Cordially

Clearwater, Florida 33516

HQ CASE (Information Only)
Source: OHIO

July, 1950, 1:45 P.M. Sighter and wife prefer anonymity. Place: Mt. Washington, Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr. R.'s aeronautical experience is extensive. He is a member of C. A.A.; was flight engineer 11 years.

Mr. R. observed the object while sitting in his backyard. A dark spot, being odd in shape first caught his eye. He describes the object as 'wingless and fuselage shaped' climbing up at a 60 degree angle into a sunny sky filled with cumulus clouds.

After a quick acceleration, the grayish metallic object reached its new elevation at 16 to 18000 feet, then stalled for about 10 seconds. While calling his wife to witness the event, Mr. R watched the object dive back to its original elevation before levelling off and racing westward across the Cincinnati skies.

The object, which looked the size of a DC 3 as it would appear at 8,000 feet, disappeared in 3 seconds without making a sound or leaving an exhaust trail. The speed was estimated at about 5,000 mph. Mr. R said the object was 'definitely solid and was controlled.' The Air Force, upon learning of the incident, visited Mr. R at his home... to get the facts!

Mr. R's integrity like that of Mr. [illegible] is above reproach: both are experienced in aircraft and balloon identification and meteorological phenomena. Both objects are unexplained unless we are willing to accept the interplanetary explanation.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

Notes:
- At the top right of the page, there is handwritten text "Bw 2-11 #4"
- The page contains two hand-drawn diagrams of what appear to be UFO or flying saucer shapes
- The top diagram is an elongated elliptical/oval shape with the word "Notes" written inside
- The bottom diagram is a circular shape with a central point and some markings around its circumference

The rest of the text is too faint or blurry to read with certainty.

THE REV. ROSS VERMILLION-KINGMAN, KANSAS CASE

A UNITED PRESS DISPATCH DATED JUNE 30, 1950 TOLD THE STORY OF A MINISTER AND FORMER PILOT WHO HAD SEEN A FLYING SAUCER THE SIZE OF A 9-12". THE REV. ROSS VERMILLION OF THE CHISNEY, KANSAS, CHRISTIAN CHURCH, A WORLD WAR II B-17 PILOT WITH MORE THAN 3000 LOGGED FLYING HOURS, WAS DRIVING ON U.S. 40 ABOUT NINE MILES WEST OF KINGMAN, SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT, WHEN HE SAW A HUGE RED LIGHT IN THE SKY...

The Reverend's own words were "WE WERE JUST RIDING ALONG AND WE STOPPED. IT WAS ONLY 500 FEET IN THE AIR, AND WE COULD SEE IT WHIRLING IN THE MOONLIGHT..."

"WE STOPPED THE CAR. A FELLOW MOTORIST CAME ALONG AND WE STOPPED. HIM. HE WATCHED IT TOO. FELLOW WAS A DRUGGIST DWAYNE MULNIX OF MEADE, KANSAS. THREE DAUGHTERS WERE WITH HIM AND WE ALL WATCHED."

"THEN I DECIDED TO TURN MY CAR AROUND AND DRIVE BACK UNDER IT. THAT'S WHEN IT TOOK OFF A HURRY. IT SHOWED TERRIFIC SPEED..."

"I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH ACCELERATION IN MY LIFE. I'VE SEEN JETS AT WICHITA AND F-80 JETS TESTED ON THE COAST, BUT THEY WON'T HOLD A CANDLE TO THE ACCELERATION OF THAT SAUCER."

There was ANOTHER MAN WHO ONCE TRIED TO GET UNDER A SAUCER. HIS NAME WAS CAPTAIN THOMAS MANTELL. THEY FOUND THE WRECKAGE OF HIS F-84 HOURS LATER...

DID THE KINGMAN SAUCER TAKE OFF IN A HURRY IN ORDER TO SAVE REVEREND VERMILLION'S LIFE AND AVOID ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE FATAL CONTACT LIKE CAPTAIN MANTELL'S? OR WAS THE REVEREND AND HIS WIFE, MR. MULNIX, AND HIS THREE DAUGHTERS MISINTERPRETING VENUS AS THE AIR FORCE CLAIMED MANTELL HAD DONE?

Dear [redacted]:

Your telegram requesting information with respect to certain reports of sightings of aerial phenomena is very much appreciated as evidence of your interest in this matter.

We regret that security and the great mass of such requests have compelled the Air Force, as a matter of fundamental policy, to refrain from discussing the specific details of individual cases of unidentified flying objects, and to withhold the names of persons who report them. We are sure that you will understand that this is in your interest as it is in that of all Americans.

As a matter of fact, the details of individual sightings reported during the 1947-1950 period are no longer available, since those data have been thoroughly analyzed.

A comprehensive report of investigation of all sightings prior to 1953 was released to the public in October 1955 by the Secretary of the Air Force. The limited number of copies of this 314-page report prohibits its distribution to the public. A request for data contained in this report, if directed to the Information Service Officer, Headquarters, USAF, Washington D.C., will receive prompt attention. A summary of the report is enclosed for your information.

Sincerely,

1 Incl
