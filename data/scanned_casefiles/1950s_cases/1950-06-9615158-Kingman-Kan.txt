REPORT (UFO) No: Quintanilla/70916/rnb/14 Dec 67
UFO Observation: June 1950
Clearwater, Florida 33516

This letter responds to your letter of November 21, 1957. We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is discernible that this sighting is not possible. This enables the Air Force and yet to perform a comprehensive investigation.

Dear Sir:

In June 1950 about 12:30 AM, near Coring, OHIO I sighted an object that for all intent and purpose appeared to be a shooting star. As it came down the horizon and shot back out at about the same angle it came down and disappeared as indicated in the following sketch.

If it had not bounced back out I would have thought it merely to be a shooting star and probably would even have remembered it. When it bounced back out, my wife also saw it. Incidentals I like to relate the details that impressed me at the time. I am taking the liberty since this is to form a permanent record, to appreciate your opinion as to the possible connection with unidentified flying objects. If more evidence are of value I think they can be obtained. At the time I reported it to the Denver Post but they made no response to it.

Cordially

NO CASE (Information Only)
Source: UFIO
July, 1950, 1:45 P.M. Sighter and wife prefer anonymity. Place: Mt. Washington, Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr. R is an engineer of C.A.A.I.; was flight engineer 11 years.
Mr. R. observed the object while sitting in his backyard. A dark spot, being gold in bright daylight, caught his eye. He described the object as "wingless and fuselage shaped" climbing up at a 60 degree angle into a sunny sky filled with cumulus clouds.
After a quick acceleration, the grayish metallic object reached its new elevation at 10 to 18,000 feet, then sailed along at about 10 seconds. While calling his wife to witness the event, Mr. R. watched the object dive back to its original elevation before levelling off and racing toward across the Cincinnati skies.
The object, which looked the size of a DC 3 as it would appear at 8,000 feet, disappeared in 3 seconds without making a sound or leaving an exhaust trail. The sound was estimated at about 5,000 r.p.m. Mr. R said the object was "definitely solid and was controlled." The Air Force, upon learning of the incident, visited Mr. R at his home ... to get the facts.
Mr. R's integrity like that of Mr. K is above reproach; both are experienced in aeronautical identification and balloonological phenomena. Both objects are unexplained unless we are willing to accept the Interplanetary explanation.

THE REV. ROSS VERMILLION-KINGMAN, KANSAS CASE
A UNITED PRESS DISPATCH DATED JUNE 25, 1950 TOLD THE REVEREND'S STORY. HIS REPORT OF A STRANGE LIGHT IN THE SKY HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED BY AUTHORITIES AND FOUND TO BE VALID. REVEREND ROSS VERMILLION OF THE CHENEY, KANSAS, CHRISTIAN CHURCH WOULD NOT GIVE DETAILS, BUT SAID THEY COULD BE SEEN ON A FLIGHT OVER KINGMAN ABOUT 100 MILES WEST OF KINGMAN, SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT, WHEN HE SAW A STRANGE AERIAL LIGHT.
"WE STOPPED THE CAR," A FELLOW MOTORIST CAME ALONG AND WE STOPPED TO TALK TO HIM. TOO PALE, SHAKEN AND SO TERRIFIED HIS SPEECH WAS UNCONTROLLED. HIS THREE DAUGHTERS WERE WITH HIM AND WE ALL WATCHED.
THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN WHO ONCE TRIED TO IGNORE A STRANGE LIGHT OVER KINGMAN, BUT WHATEVER HE SAW MANTLED HIM WITH TERROR. THEY FOUND THE REVEREND VERMILLION IN A STATE OF SHOCK.
DID THE KINGMAN SAUCER TAKE OFF IN A HURRY IN ORDER TO SAVE REVEREND VERMILLION'S LIFE AND AVOID ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT LIKE CAPTAIN MANTELL'S? OR WAS THE REVEREND AND HIS WIFE, MR. MULNIX, AND HIS THREE DAUGHTERS MISINTERPRETING VENUS AS THE AIR FORCE CLAIMED MANTELL HAD DONE?

29 JUNE 1950
HECKER, S.D.

Your telegram requesting information with respect to certain reports of sightings of unidentified air phenomena is very much appreciated as evidence of your interest in this matter.

We wish that security and the great mass of such requests have compelled us to take a stern position in individual cases of the identification of aircraft and flying objects, and to withhold the names of persons who report them. But we are sure that you will understand that this is in your interest as well as it is in that of all Americans.

As to the matter of fact, the details of individual sightings reported during the 12/27/50 to 1/5/51 period are no longer available, since those data have been destroyed.

A comprehensive report of investigation of all sightings prior to 1952 was released to the public in October 1955 by the Secretary of the Air Force. This limited number of copies of this report prohibits its distribution to the public. A request for a copy contained in this report is referred to the information services, USAF, for appropriate action. A summary of the report is enclosed for your information.

Sincerely,

J. Isael
