The document is a "PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD" dated 22 May 1956, with details about a UFO sighting reported near Monroe, Louisiana. The card contains information such as the date, time, location, type of observation, observer details, a brief summary of the sighting, and conclusions. The text in the document is as follows:

1. DATE: 22 May 1956  
2. LOCATION: 50 miles NW of Monroe, La.
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Last  
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual  
5. PHOTOS: Yes  
6. SOURCE: AF Pilot & observer  
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1-2 mins  
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1  
9. COURSE: NE  
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING (Following I'm phone call): The object was about the size of a C-47. One cross-shaped which was reddish-orange in color. It made an abrupt turn to the left and turned reddish-white as it flew away to intercept it w/negative results.
11. COMMENTS: Conversation w/pilot revealed that this reddish-orange UFO sighting in Korea had seen many types of unknowns here but that this was a new phenomena and previously he had never seen one like it until this latest sighting. He was assigned to 35th-1302 May 56. Results to be recorded on this card upon receipt of his signed statement-AF Form 112 (Rev 28 Sep 53).

II. NARRATIVE: SOURCES appeared to be intelligent and were very cooperative. SOURCES stated they observed an unidentified flying object on 22 MAY 55 at approx 2000 hours in the eastern sky from Greenville AFB, Miss, while taking a navigational flight in a T-33 jet aircraft. SOURCES stated they observed the object for approx 15 minutes. Many stars were visible during the observation but the object stood out due to its superior brightness. The object appeared to be stationary and had a brilliant white light which seemed to pulsate. The object would suddenly speed up and rush through the sky, then abruptly stop and reverse its direction of flight. No sound was heard. The object did not move in front of or toward anything. "Object" was described as round or spherical in shape and was estimated to be approx 6-8 feet in diameter. No exhaust or flame was visible. The maneuvers performed by the object seemed to defy the laws of physics, as it could change direction at high speeds without any apparent slowing down or turning. The object was observed until it suddenly accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.

He was looking towards approximately 300° when he last saw the object. Object on the ground appeared to be about 075 feet wide and a little above the horizon. It could not indicate the angular dimensions of the object, when he last saw it. At that time, the object appeared to be stationary and little more than 5,000 feet above the ground. The first source had noted this type of object, and in his opinion, it was an impression of importance adequate object. Another source than 500 feet with had not observed the object, but was impressed by the apparent maneuverability of object.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. In the opinion of the preparing officer the sighting as observed by the witnesses was caused by an optical phenomenon. A temperature inversion reported in the area of the sighting may have been a contributing factor to the occurrence.
2. Supplementary investigative efforts and the descriptions of sighting provided by police officers and other eyewitnesses indicate that the object was caused by a balloon, possibly a meteor or some other aerial object rather than a type of optical phenomenon as indicated. 
COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
1. This headquarters does not concur with the opinion of the preparing officer that this sighting was caused by an optical phenomenon. Inasmuch as the object appeared to be a solid object and approached and receded in relation to the balloon, a type of optical phenomenon is indicated.
2. In the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was caused by the 22/200 carbon radiosonde balloon released from the U.S. Weather Bureau at Shreveport, La. On Aug 25th, 1956. The investigation unit placed a 500 gram radiosonde balloon in the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting. 
3. The motion and the manner of flight of the object observed is consistent with the performance characteristics known to be generated by the passing aircraft coupled with the jet exhaust which would create the illusion of the passage of a large object. A falling child's balloon with an open hand would stimulate this action.

Education: B. S. Business Administration; Graduate, Pilot Training.
Qualifications: SOURCE has been on active duty for approximately three years and acting as Auditor for approximately three years.
II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE indicated that, although subject was hesitant to report the sighting as completely as possible, SOURCE's estimate of his reliability as a reporter of information may be considered reliable.
III. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE indicated that on 22 May 1956 at approximately 2205 CST while flying in the front seat of a T-33 aircraft at 500 knots he observed an object which appeared to be round in shape and described as being luminous. The object was estimated to be approximately 1,000 feet from the aircraft and traveling at a speed estimated to be exceeding 1,000 mph. It was said to have the appearance of a "planet of the sky". As the object was passed the SOURCE stated he was unable to find any outlines or details on the object. It appeared to have a great distance away from the aircraft. When suddenly the object turned straight toward the aircraft, which caused the pilot to take evasive action by executing a steep climbing turn. SOURCE stated they cruised in front of the object again at high speed on a westerly course. SOURCE stated they cruised in front of the object again at high speed on a westerly course. SOURCE stated they regained visual contact with the object, which did not resume its apparent pursuit of the aircraft. The object then turned and descended at a high rate of speed and disappeared. No noise was apparent on object's west side. SOURCE said maneuverability was exceptional and precision of motion amazing. Relationship to the aircraft, SOURCE stated that his aircraft passed under the observation of the object and continued on a heading of 270 degrees. His aircraft was traveling approximately 500 mph and the object appeared on his left side. The object at this point appeared to "oscillate" and "pulse" and crossed his flight path at an estimated 1,000 feet. [sketch of object] SOURCE saw no clear outline of object other than a circular appearance. The size was estimated in comparison to a 50-cent piece held in the palm of his hand at arm's length and appeared to be approximately 12-16 inches in diameter. SOURCE noted one red light resembling an aircraft running light on top of the dome. The remainder of the object was luminous, giving off a steady brilliant whitish-blue glow. SOURCE obtained a good view of the object from underneath side while passing under it. Source described the surface as smooth, wave-like impression. (Final 4' sketch of under side).
